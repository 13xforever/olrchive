14000	18000	Tonight, May 11th, 2008, the new Nintendo Channel is up and running,
18000	21000	Burnout Paradise is soon headed to the PC,
21000	27000	and the classic first-person shooter is about to get another sequel.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
33000	36000	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	40000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games,
40000	43000	video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43000	45000	It's where every gamer has a voice.
45000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts.
47000	49000	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only
49000	52000	Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
52000	53000	Hi.
53000	54000	How are you?
54000	55000	I'm tired.
55000	56000	You're tired?
56000	58000	It's been a long weekend.
58000	60000	It's been a long everything.
60000	63000	It's been a hot weekend too, and I'm worried about next weekend
63000	65000	because it's supposed to be like 20 degrees hotter,
65000	67000	and I'm like, we're going to die during the show,
67000	69000	so I've got to figure out air condition plans.
69000	71000	I have a solution for you.
71000	72000	What's that?
72000	74000	That window, does it have a screen?
74000	76000	It does have a screen on it.
76000	78000	So you can't do a little thingy, I know.
78000	79000	No.
79000	80000	You can kick that screen off there.
80000	81000	Take the screen off.
81000	83000	Put in the air conditioner, put a block over it.
83000	86000	It's not that hard, see those little black things on there?
86000	87000	Yeah.
87000	88000	That's for pushing the screen off.
88000	89000	We'll see.
89000	90000	All right.
90000	92000	This is now Home Improvement, the podcast.
92000	93000	Well, and on top of that.
93000	94000	What?
94000	95000	It's Studio Improvement.
95000	97000	The other voice you hear over there, Tech Master Loki,
97000	99000	since he's talking out of turn.
99000	100000	That's all right.
100000	101000	I'm talking intern.
101000	104000	But it's easy and cheap.
104000	105000	They're not expensive.
105000	106000	Yeah.
106000	107000	I'll figure something out.
107000	108000	That's why we have a budget.
108000	111000	I've got a week to figure it out.
111000	113000	Which means I'll do something about it on Saturday.
113000	115000	I'll worry about it tomorrow.
115000	117000	And how are you doing, Loki?
117000	118000	I'm doing fine.
118000	119000	Yeah?
119000	120000	Had a good week?
120000	121000	Yeah.
121000	122000	I guess.
122000	123000	All right.
123000	124000	All things considered.
124000	125000	You went out of town today, right?
125000	126000	Yeah.
126000	127000	I went to Oakland, and then I came back from Oakland.
127000	128000	And you're back alive.
128000	129000	Amazing.
129000	130000	Oakland sucks.
130000	131000	All right.
131000	133000	If you want to join us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
133000	135000	Remember All Games listeners?
135000	137000	We actually don't use the same chat channel right now
137000	139000	as the other All Games shows.
139000	140000	Maybe in the future.
140000	141000	But for right now, we're in our own channel.
141000	144000	It's Orange Lounge is the channel name on the Game Surge Network.
144000	147000	Or you just go to that website, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
147000	149000	In fact, Act Deaf is in chat tonight,
149000	151000	and he is calling it Orange Lounge Improvement Radio
151000	153000	because it's like improving the lounge in your house
153000	155000	or the lounge where I was at.
155000	156000	All right. Forget it.
156000	158000	Anyhow, lots of fun stuff on tonight's show.
158000	159000	I'll tell you all about it.
159000	161000	But first, we always start the show off with a little bit of
161000	162000	how was your gaming week?
162000	164000	Dark soccer, how was your gaming week?
164000	165000	Uh.
165000	167000	That good, huh?
167000	170000	Dan worked on the No Fear pinball today.
170000	174000	And it is in now fully playable condition.
174000	178000	And as soon as he finished up some last switch tweaks on it,
178000	179000	it will be good to go.
179000	184000	And I helped by taking pictures of stuff.
184000	187000	It's a pinball table, and I helped.
187000	191000	I, um, we also got, um, I don't know if I mentioned this last,
191000	192000	well, the week before.
192000	196000	We got a Black Knight 2000 finally.
196000	197000	Nice.
197000	199000	And so the stickers for it arrived
199000	201000	because the play field's pretty trashed up right now.
201000	204000	But, um, the only problem is that they gave us the
204000	207000	Rung Magna Lock stickers so we have to get the right ones.
207000	210000	And, um, I played more Ragnarok.
210000	213000	And Dan's getting me the Iron Man game for Xbox 360.
213000	215000	When's that out? Like next month?
215000	216000	It's already out.
216000	217000	Oh. I guess that makes sense.
217000	219000	Came out in time for the movie.
219000	221000	I haven't been video game shopping in a while.
221000	222000	I have enough games to hold me over.
222000	226000	I'm just gonna pretend that it's not dude, you know, playing him.
226000	228000	It's not, what, Robert Downey Jr.?
228000	230000	You're not a big Robert? I thought you loved the movie.
230000	231000	I do.
231000	232000	But you just don't like him.
232000	234000	Oh, okay.
234000	235000	Whatever.
235000	236000	But I'm gonna take you to see it.
236000	237000	I will. I will.
237000	238000	We're going tomorrow.
238000	239000	I can do it tomorrow.
239000	240000	We're going tomorrow.
240000	241000	I can do it tomorrow.
241000	242000	I don't know, cause, um,
242000	243000	Oh.
243000	244000	Yeah, somebody's back in town tomorrow.
244000	245000	I gotta go hang with them.
245000	246000	We'll go Wednesday.
246000	247000	Alright, we'll go this week.
247000	248000	We will.
248000	249000	I still kinda wanna see Speed Racer
249000	250000	even though everything I've heard about it is terrible.
250000	251000	It's fucking awesome.
251000	252000	A lot of people like it.
252000	253000	Did you see it, Loki?
253000	254000	It was awesome.
254000	255000	Was it?
255000	256000	See, now I heard that you wouldn't like Speed Racer
256000	257000	unless you're a seven-year-old boy.
257000	258000	I hate Speed Racer.
258000	260000	I absolutely hate the cartoon, and I like the movie.
260000	263000	See, I like Speed Racer because it's done by Tatunoko Studios,
263000	266000	and that's the place they gave us Gatchaman.
266000	268000	It's, it's, it gets, let me put it this way,
268000	270000	it's like, uh, Willy Wonka with cars.
270000	274000	It's just really, it goes from varying levels of, like,
274000	276000	what the hell, to, you know, it's pretty cool.
276000	278000	There's a lot of stuff that they throw in there,
278000	280000	you know, pretty awesome,
280000	282000	and then there's a lot of stuff that they throw in just, you know,
282000	283000	because it's a family movie.
283000	285000	I need to see Racer X.
285000	287000	Now, see, the reason why I kinda wanted to see Speed Racer
287000	290000	is it looks like F-Zero, the movie, which is kind of awesome.
290000	293000	Uh, not really, but it's cool.
293000	295000	I mean, it's cool in its own right.
295000	298000	As long as the Mach 5 has all of its crap, I'm happy.
298000	299000	You know, that's the game they need to make.
299000	301000	I wanna see, like, a game like F-Zero,
301000	304000	but on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
304000	308000	Well, there was, uh, Fatal Inertia, but that was kinda, eh.
308000	312000	I wanna see something just, like, that'll just blow my mind
312000	314000	with how great the graphics are and all that.
314000	315000	It was supposed to be blow-my-mind awesome,
315000	318000	but it was blow-my-mind average.
318000	321000	So, I don't know.
321000	327000	Anyways, uh, this week, I played a whole ton of Grand Theft Auto IV.
327000	329000	Just a whole ton of it.
329000	333000	Everything from the single player to, uh, multiplayer.
333000	335000	Did some ranked multiplayer.
335000	339000	I'm now level 2, and you can actually, um, you know,
339000	341000	rank up, I think, all the way to level 10.
341000	342000	So, I have a long ways to go there.
342000	343000	I like how they do it.
343000	346000	It's basically just experience or, I guess, uh,
346000	348000	money that you earn throughout the game.
348000	350000	So, you can play, you know, for quite a while.
350000	354000	There's a few lag issues I ran into, but overall, it's pretty good.
354000	357000	Um, I just absolutely love that game.
357000	358000	What can I say?
358000	360000	Um, other than Grand Theft Auto,
360000	362000	I did get to play a few other games today.
362000	365000	I played, uh, God of War Chains of Olympus,
365000	366000	and that's pretty cool.
366000	368000	I played mainly the demo before,
368000	370000	so it was nice to actually get to play the full game.
370000	373000	And, um, you know, if you like God of War,
373000	374000	you're gonna love this game.
374000	377000	It's absolutely amazing to see that they were able to put
377000	380000	a God of War game onto the PSP and not really sacrifice anything.
380000	382000	So, that was pretty cool.
382000	384000	Um, and then, of course, more Space Invaders Extreme,
384000	387000	and that game's just, you know, all sorts of awesome.
387000	390000	So, uh, yeah, that's pretty much it.
390000	393000	I've been trying this week to, um,
393000	395000	get around to playing Speed Racer for the Wii,
395000	397000	and especially after last night,
397000	399000	it was funny because Nellie went and saw the movie with me,
399000	400000	and she's like,
400000	402000	Did they have a game for this?
402000	403000	I'm like,
403000	404000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, hold on, hold on.
404000	407000	Your wife, who hates games that aren't called Bejeweled or Zuma,
407000	409000	wanted to go buy a video game.
409000	411000	She likes Excite Truck.
411000	412000	Oh, yeah, I forgot she liked Excite Truck, too.
412000	414000	Well, she said that this would be perfect
414000	417000	if they had Excite Truck, but with those tracks,
417000	418000	she's like, that would be perfect.
418000	420000	I'm like, well, they have a game for it.
420000	422000	I'm not sure if it's like Excite Truck.
422000	424000	I'm pretty sure it's not, but, you know, you can try it anyways.
424000	426000	But does she like Mario Kart?
426000	428000	She hasn't played Mario Kart yet.
428000	429000	I don't think she would.
429000	430000	She loves Excite Truck.
430000	433000	Is your wife a fan of Monster Trucks or something?
433000	435000	No, she just likes the gameplay of that,
435000	437000	and I hope they announce a sequel,
437000	439000	because that game needs a sequel.
439000	442000	Frisbee says Excite Truck should come down in price.
442000	443000	It should.
443000	445000	Has it not come down in price after all this time?
445000	446000	I don't think so.
446000	447000	Wow.
447000	449000	It's Excite Truck, so no.
449000	450000	Amazing.
450000	453000	As far as I remember, it's not being sold anymore.
453000	456000	All right, so anything else for your gaming week?
456000	457000	That was it.
457000	462000	I've been trying to get around to playing Trackmania United,
462000	465000	so hopefully I'll get to play that this week.
465000	466000	My gaming week.
466000	468000	I had a Wii Week, which is strange,
468000	470000	because the Wii went unloved for months and months,
470000	471000	and then like Brawl came out,
471000	473000	and I was playing that for a little while,
473000	475000	and then Mario Kart came out, and I've been playing that,
475000	476000	and I already talked about it last week.
476000	478000	I continue to play it this week, and I think,
478000	480000	you know what, I think this is my favorite Mario Kart
480000	481000	since the original.
481000	482000	I think it really is.
482000	485000	Like, even though the online is, you know, janky,
485000	487000	because Nintendo made it, and, you know,
487000	490000	they don't nearly have the online competency
490000	492000	that, like, Microsoft has,
492000	494000	the online does add a really fun element into it.
494000	496000	I've got to say, if you have your computer there,
496000	497000	and you're able to network the friends together
497000	498000	to get the game online going,
498000	501000	because just impromptu, last night,
501000	503000	I was on Justin.tv just randomly,
503000	505000	because I had said I was going to do the
505000	507000	every extend extra extreme with Space Invaders music,
507000	511000	and somehow that turned into playing Mario Kart Wii
511000	513000	against four Orange Hans Radio listeners
513000	515000	who joined me for an online match,
515000	516000	and it was a lot of fun.
516000	518000	I had a lot of fun playing Mario Kart online with them.
518000	520000	Of course, I won.
520000	521000	I made it even more fun.
521000	522000	No, I lost battle mode, though.
522000	524000	They whooped me in battle, but I won the race mode.
524000	525000	I don't like battle mode.
525000	527000	It's not as cool as it used to be.
527000	528000	The battle mode is not nearly as cool as it used to be,
528000	532000	but the game, I'd consider versus mode like the game itself,
532000	533000	and that's great.
533000	534000	I love the courses.
534000	536000	I love the new courses.
536000	537000	They're all so good.
537000	541000	Still, I stand by not really caring for their selection
541000	543000	of retro courses that they brought back.
543000	545000	I would agree with you to a point.
545000	547000	The thing is that the GameCube one,
547000	549000	I didn't play a lot of,
549000	551000	so I'm glad they brought some of those really good courses over,
551000	552000	like the Volcano one.
552000	554000	It's one of my favorite stages.
554000	556000	I don't think they call it Volcano,
556000	557000	because there's another Volcano,
557000	560000	but it's like Donkey Kong's Jungle or something,
560000	561000	but it was the GameCube one.
561000	563000	You get shot up this giant mountain,
563000	564000	and then you race down it.
564000	565000	I love that track.
565000	566000	See, that's the thing.
566000	569000	That was so similar to the snowboarding one.
569000	571000	That was also a Donkey Kong-themed thing.
571000	572000	I don't know.
572000	575000	I really think that there was a few tracks in there
575000	577000	that they should have brought in.
577000	579000	Maybe had taken a vote or something.
579000	580000	See, but here's the thing.
580000	584000	If Nintendo was smart about their online strategy,
584000	586000	they would have downloadable tracks,
586000	588000	and they could do more retro stuff.
588000	591000	Yes, and that's a key phrase, if they were smart.
591000	593000	But the thing is, they're not,
593000	595000	and they're playing it way too damn safe,
595000	597000	and there's not going to be downloadable content
597000	600000	available for these games for quite a while.
600000	602000	And there is one game,
602000	606000	and that's coming up in the show role about download content.
606000	610000	I know that there's a service that they already unveiled it
610000	611000	or announced it,
611000	613000	but it's not being implemented until the summer.
613000	614000	Well, here's the other weird thing,
614000	617000	is that they've got another problem on that Wii to figure out,
617000	619000	and that's the fact that I ran out of space on my Wii this week.
619000	621000	Now, granted, I've downloaded, like,
621000	623000	craploads of virtual console games,
623000	625000	because I'm a whore for retro games,
625000	627000	and, you know, every channel they released,
627000	629000	and when I finally copied the Mario Kart channel,
629000	631000	or I wanted to, or no, no,
631000	632000	I copied the Mario Kart channel,
632000	634000	and then when that new channel came out this week
634000	635000	that we're going to talk about later,
635000	636000	I ran out of space.
636000	637000	I couldn't install it.
637000	638000	I had to go back and delete.
638000	640000	So I've already filled up my Wii,
640000	643000	and WiiWare's not even up yet.
643000	645000	So they've got a storage problem on top of everything.
645000	646000	I don't know how the hell I'm going to fit
646000	647000	download content on that thing.
647000	649000	Luckily, the WiiWare games aren't that large.
649000	651000	Like, under 48 megs.
651000	653000	I mean, I'm going to have to copy
653000	655000	the virtual console games to my card
655000	657000	and copy them over one on a player.
657000	658000	It's just such a hassle.
658000	659000	Well...
659000	661000	One little patch is all it would take
661000	663000	to use that SD card as a normal, like, memory.
663000	664000	Seriously.
664000	666000	Yep, and that's Nintendo, though, for you.
666000	669000	If it works as a hassle patch, okay for us.
669000	670000	Just like the Friends codes.
670000	672000	It works, but it's a hassle.
673000	675000	Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, the man that, uh,
675000	677000	precedes us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights
677000	678000	when we tape live.
678000	680000	He goes live at 5 o'clock Pacific.
680000	681000	He's calling me out.
681000	683000	He says, I would beat you, Sky.
683000	686000	Well, I see that challenge, Mr. Blackwolf.
686000	688000	We'll set up a challenge this week at some point.
688000	690000	I'm actually not that great at Mario Kart.
690000	691000	I want to play.
691000	692000	Okay.
692000	693000	Well, I'll play.
693000	694000	Hey, this can be the ChromeHounds event
694000	695000	that never was.
695000	697000	Well, I'm not that great at Mario Kart,
697000	698000	but I'll play.
698000	699000	We'll play. It'll be fun.
699000	700000	Alright, Bobby.
700000	701000	Let's set up a time.
701000	702000	Especially, you know, and that's another thing
702000	704000	that I don't really care about this Mario Kart,
704000	708000	and the fact that, you know, the AI is retarded
708000	710000	and the item selection's also retarded,
710000	712000	because when you're up in the first place,
712000	714000	you get nothing, and when you're in the last place,
714000	716000	it's like, blue shell, blue shell, blue shell, blue shell.
716000	717000	So...
717000	718000	Yeah.
718000	719000	Blue shells need to die to fire.
719000	721000	Other Nintendo games I've been playing this week,
721000	724000	I picked up a game for $15 at Costco.
724000	727000	It's the Williams Pinball Table Collection.
727000	728000	I don't think that's the actual name of the game.
728000	729000	I apologize, but it's...
729000	730000	You can't miss it.
730000	732000	It's the pinball collection featuring
732000	733000	all the Williams tables.
733000	735000	So not only did Dark Soccer have a pinball week,
735000	739000	I did too, and I played the shit at a pinbot.
739000	741000	That was awesome to get to play that again.
741000	744000	And for the value, considering I only paid $15 for it,
744000	746000	and I imagine it's $19.99 normally,
746000	748000	because Costco, you know, marks everything down,
748000	750000	it's not a bad deal at all.
750000	752000	With all the tables you get in there,
752000	754000	you have a lot of retro tables in there.
754000	756000	You know, when you consider the pinball FX
756000	760000	on Xbox Live is $10, and they're very similar,
760000	763000	but in the case of the Wii 1, you get to play
763000	765000	kind of games you remember and love.
765000	766000	It's kind of cool.
766000	768000	I got to tell you, the control scheme is kind of funny.
768000	770000	Like, funny in a good way.
770000	773000	What you do, you use the Wii and the nunchuk,
773000	775000	I mean the Wiimote and the nunchuk.
775000	777000	And the trigger on the Wiimote is the right flipper,
777000	779000	and then the little trigger on the nunchuk
779000	780000	is the left flipper.
780000	782000	So, actually, you were, like, pulling little triggers
782000	783000	to move the flippers.
783000	784000	It's kind of cute.
784000	788000	And then the little controller thingy
788000	796320	thingy on the nunchuck is the thing that you pull back to launch the ball.
796320	802440	So it's kind of neat and it's interesting because they built achievements into the game
802440	803440	which I think is interesting.
803440	807880	Like if you get a thousand points or I mean a hundred thousand points on this table then
807880	812600	you get a credit to play the tournament games which I thought was kind of cute.
812600	813600	So they thought a waste.
813600	816860	I think it's good that they have that on the analog just because there's like for example
816860	822360	pinball like you were saying has the spiral on it to where it's not the very top one it's
822360	824800	like the second to last one gives you more points.
824800	825800	Right skill shots.
825800	826800	Yeah.
826800	829400	Tons of pinball games have skill shots so the older ones not so much it was just kind
829400	832800	of about which shoot would it go down to but yeah pinball and some of the other later ones
832800	834920	but it's got some great tables in it.
834920	838840	A whirlwind remember that one that one was fun where the thing we almost bought a whirlwind
838840	842360	oh but the the good thing about whirlwind though is that you actually want to have the
842360	846600	real table for that so that when you go inside after being outside all day yes it blows the
846600	847600	wind at you.
847600	848600	I know.
848600	849600	And fortunately the Wii doesn't do that.
849600	850600	Sad.
850600	851600	But it was good times.
851600	852600	So.
852600	853600	So what else was all on that collection?
853600	859680	Oh gosh I got I Black Knight I know was there Taxi AJ Mixx is pointing out in chat I guess
859680	866520	they looked it up let's see actually actdeft is linking me to a page that has more information
866520	870200	about the game because I'm too lazy to go grab my copy of the game it has some really
870200	875520	old tables in it too like what is the one there's almost like a giant Satan on it that's
875520	879920	a very there's it's a very early early table on it as long as it doesn't have hyper ball
879920	880920	then I'm okay.
880920	886080	Gorgar the first ever talking pinball machine that's the one with like Satan on it Space
886080	891960	Shuttle is on there too yeah I'm looking at the list good times so let's see which of
891960	899000	these I own no I'm kidding but seriously for the value it's a great value you know especially
899000	903640	when you consider there's a very comparable game where the tables aren't quite as memorable
903640	908120	I mean don't get me wrong I like pinball FX but it's not quite as memorable as some of
908120	912840	these tables I mean they're classic tables for a reason so no sadly the Tommy table is
912840	917880	not in the game DJ Dark Knight so the Tommy table is freaking awesome if you like pinball
917880	922080	at all it's worth the money to get this for the Wii it's fun that's that's my thoughts
922080	926720	it was the big thing about Black Knight the Magna save mm-hmm mm-hmm they sent us the
926720	932740	wrong Magna save stickers alright so that's gonna do it for my gaming week because otherwise

1067680	1075480	news we had a lot this week take it away Loki yes of course as Rob was mentioning when he
1075480	1081240	tried to install the Nintendo channel his Wii said no you're out of space but I the
1081240	1086720	Nintendo channel or as it's known in Japan everybody's a Nintendo channel fuck that's
1086720	1094520	my Nintendo channel now is available on the Wii I will allow you to rate different games
1094520	1100760	include I think we we were games virtual console and full Wii games after you played them for
1100760	1104840	an hour as well as there's gonna be some I think video that you can watch of different
1104840	1109580	games I think the coolest thing though that you'll probably see though available for it
1109580	1115340	is DS demo downloads which is pretty awesome and you can stream those to your DS just like
1115340	1123180	a you know download station so go check it out it's absolutely free and who doesn't like
1123180	1129960	demos free if you sell your soul to Nintendo yes yes because you have to agree that the
1129960	1134880	thing will I don't know monitor what the hell to do it's sending like anonymous you should
1134880	1138920	jet usage data about the games you've been playing so like you know you know how the
1138920	1142760	weeds been secretly compiling the amount of time you can go to that note in your board
1142760	1145920	you can see how long you've been playing the games well that information gets sent to Nintendo
1145920	1152080	and in turn you get the list of DS games like you don't do it no games no DS demos for you
1152080	1156640	I mean I don't know like I'm not too worried about it I gladly clicked yes I mean I don't
1156640	1162440	care I mean seriously what is Nintendo gonna do knowing that some you know Shmo in Sacramento
1162440	1167640	California it was playing way too much and I know that I like your site truck and then
1167640	1171900	we'll go hey people like excite truck let's make another one and that's not a bad thing
1171900	1175440	I think it's fairly smart of them to have something like that enacted it's a good way
1175440	1183280	to I think it's a good non intrusive way I think to for market research exactly this
1183280	1188160	isn't like EA where it's like hey we've got your credit card number we want to know what
1188160	1191600	you're buying true I don't think Nintendo saves your credit card information you have
1191600	1197960	to input it every freaking time you know so once again you know it works but it's an inconvenience
1197960	1203560	you know so what did you did you actually check out the channel I checked out the channel
1203560	1208000	not download it didn't even plug it in too busy playing Grand Theft Auto 4 I did download
1208000	1213280	it and it wasn't quite as cool as I had hoped they have some videos on there which is kind
1213280	1218120	of interesting to see on the Wii isn't that just a recurring theme with the Wii wasn't
1218120	1224720	quite as cool as I had hoped no I don't know it just you know I do think the concept of
1224720	1229160	turning it into a DS demo station that was kind of cool because it was cool like I downloaded
1229160	1234020	the brain H2 jump demo just for the hell of it okay seriously it was interesting yes I'm
1234020	1238520	glad it's it's an interesting thing it's also something they talked about III prior to the
1238520	1242680	we launching that this was already supposed to have happened at launch what's taking them
1242680	1248400	so long I mean seriously what is taking them so long to implement this crap it's like oh
1248400	1253320	well eventually we'll get a unified you know online service and stuff oh great I'm glad
1253320	1259040	that you're catching up to Microsoft it'll only be a few years now well maybe they just
1259040	1262160	had some fine-tuning to do or something or maybe they just kind of rushed the we out
1262160	1266120	there and now they you know there's only so many people that work there the people are
1266120	1270880	interested in online what are they talking about Xbox Live statistics are bullshit they're
1270880	1277620	pulling out of their ass with all right I'm looking at chat here act F says I like the
1277620	1282320	channel I like the demos AJ mix says demos is pretty much the high point and it has the
1282320	1291240	commercial that has the kid that says I am mudkip I miss that I have to go back and look
1291240	1295680	I mean I was thinking like wow be kind of cool if there was like a YouTube is channel
1295680	1299560	or cute little viral things could be on there but then I'm thinking oh but there's the internet
1299560	1305600	channel so I could just go to YouTube on the internet channel why bother and then four
1305600	1313680	hours later you'll be able to watch the latest viral videos exactly all right other stuff
1313680	1319200	going on in the Wii world and a lot of fanboys including myself have been eagerly anticipating
1319200	1325380	the release someday of Kid Icarus on the Wii and here's the thing is that it may have actually
1325380	1331360	been spoiled this week by IGN you know that guy over at IGN who's you know him he's like
1331360	1335680	the quintessential Nintendo fanboy not that that's an issue but he's just is Matt Casa
1335680	1341260	Casa mass enough that as they say his name Casa role Casa Massena all right he probably
1341260	1347860	heard that like a million times in the third grade Loki come on all right so this guy he
1347860	1353600	was in the IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast first off Nintendo has voice chat that's amazing
1353600	1362140	they name all their podcasts after stuff like they have was it the I want to say ring red
1362140	1368360	ring of death is their Xbox 360 podcast nice oh I see so they make one they make fun of
1368360	1373100	the system in their name like you know and then the PlayStation 3 crayon eating cast
1373100	1377560	I don't know all right fine whatever the IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast he says in this
1377560	1383160	of course Nintendo is gonna have some e3 surprises you know Kid Icarus for crying out loud how
1383160	1388760	many times we have to say it it's coming out for crying out loud so you know and you kind
1388760	1391920	of think this guy might kind of know something going on on the inside because usually you
1391920	1396680	know these really big gaming sites are kind of in on what's the no it really wouldn't
1396680	1401460	suppose there's been little breadcrumb clues to that this is gonna happen a he showed up
1401460	1406320	in brawl that should be a big clue right there I honestly think that's a clue and we heard
1406320	1412680	that what was it Factor five I think was developing an unknown game that was suspected to be this
1412680	1419080	so and then I guess on the next show the same guy he actually said Kid Icarus that's another
1419080	1422620	one I'm really anticipating just because I love the franchise and I'm sure the developer
1422620	1428400	will make a really pretty game so he said it twice that it's coming so it is maybe if
1428400	1433400	I keep seeing stuff it'll come to some things say they're coming and never do so all right
1433400	1440080	well I can't I can't wait for I cannot wait for compile to reform and have a booth at
1440080	1443880	E3 this year and announce Guardian Legend 2 I can't wait for that that's that's going
1443880	1448000	to be the show right there was a Guardian Legend 2 so we want Guardian Legend 3 what
1448000	1452360	was Guardian Legend 2 the Guardian Legend that we got over here in the US oh oh yeah
1452360	1458720	first one was Guardic or whatever so just let you know just get together and make a
1458720	1465040	new game that is like Zelda plus shooter and that would be awesome all right and let's
1465040	1469360	see what now something that didn't make our little list but I know I saw it on the internet
1469360	1473420	there was like some concept artwork that supposedly leaked although I don't know some of it kind
1473420	1477880	of screamed fanboy to me no it was actually it was stuff that they're it was a company
1477880	1484760	pitching the idea of a Kid Icarus game they set up a bunch of different shots hmm but
1484760	1488880	like it was weird because if you've seen the shots pit looks all like buff well they have
1488880	1493920	a bunch of different styles of shots and stuff so it's not just that super buff one that
1493920	1503200	you're seeing and it was from a website come combo with K mm-hmm and I guess not to be
1503200	1510240	confused with zombo there was another website that had some stuff but uh they said that
1510240	1515160	I guess it was supposedly from Factor 5 where those pieces are working and they have a but
1515160	1520480	like I said a bunch of different shots there's some that look really realistic there's one
1520480	1526960	that looks like a really shitty cartoon there's some emo shots something that looks like it
1526960	1531440	might been out of like Kingdom Hearts you know just like a whole bunch of stuff but
1531440	1537780	yeah some of it looks a little bit fanboyish but it's slowly a fact that the Kid Icarus
1537780	1543000	game would be coming to we in the first place is a little fanboyish don't you think it is
1543000	1546960	I hey I will be first in line to pre-order and then thusly buy this game well because
1546960	1551160	I love the original 8-bit that much well you know since they have the characters from mother

1557880	1562720	I'm not the one that's saying hey let's localize a game for Europe and I'll bring it to the
1562720	1570840	US all right let's move on with some more stories import time FTW anywho um for those
1570840	1577320	who have been waiting for WiiWare we have a bit of a release from Nintendo giving us some ideas
1577320	1582120	that are going of what's definitely going to be out for the launch of WiiWare and if you are ready

1618200	1624040	good or not I'm not buying that at a protest there's no dr. Mario I thought dr. Mario got
1624040	1631200	what was like a late add to the list or something yeah it's coming I need to throw pills at by right
1631200	1639640	and you could do it on the internet yes we'll be fun another game not coming to WiiWare but
1639640	1647840	coming to the Wii and this is a pretty interesting rumor apparently there are a couple links coming
1647840	1656840	from I guess some Brazilian sites the first one talking a little bit about Castlevania for the
1656840	1663800	Wii a second link also coming from another Brazilian site apparently has some I guess
1663800	1671600	quotes from Shinji Harano and the executive VP for Konami USA stating that a Castlevania titles
1671600	1678640	were headed to the Wii and DS he says that we'll learn more information about these titles come
1678640	1686080	next week when Konami is holding a press event in the US god damn it where's my invite for this shit
1686080	1692280	seriously now they promised us that when a Castlevania game was going to be coming that
1692280	1695880	you would not actually have to use the Wii mode as a whip right because that would be the most
1695880	1704480	hokey thing ever yeah it doesn't really say anything about that though but I if I were to
1704480	1712320	guess I would say you probably use the Wii mode as a whip all right anyhow moving on to other
1712320	1717520	Nintendo news Wii Fit we still don't have this game in the US but it's come out in Japan it's
1717520	1722840	come out in the UK see now this is Nintendo playing a little game with us called here's
1722840	1730240	what the UK feels like all the time with this game oh darn I can't get Wii Fit so sad oh well
1730240	1734760	least I had brawl early and some you know Mario Kart and we're really sure you don't need Wii Fit
1734760	1740920	I'm pretty sure you sure you already bought Wii Fit okay so shut up that's with you I have
1740920	1747640	Wii Fit it's on order it's paid for I just wait all right rare that roughly your feathers there
1747640	1753680	lucky all right so here's the thing is that Wii Fit is already causing a little bit of controversy
1753680	1759920	okay here's the thing is that there's this poster and the poster post on this website the DIS boards
1759920	1766440	and this is what they said that the Wii Fit basically crushed one girl's dreams this is it
1766440	1771320	quote my relative came around this weekend and we let her play on our Wii Fit we've all laughed
1771320	1776020	and joked about being told that we're fat and need to lose weight but I was gobsmacked when
1776020	1781960	it told her that she is overweight apparently it was this ten-year-old girl who is four foot
1781960	1787760	nine and she weighs six stone that's you know healthy all right and apparently we we judgment
1787760	1793360	called her overweight and the girl was really upset and they had to kind of like calm her down
1793360	1797920	and the quote continues I know it's just a game but seriously we already have to worry about young
1797920	1802080	girls starving themselves to look like magazine models and now we have a game that tells them
1802080	1810120	they're fat is this is this gonna be a problem when this game comes out over here question who
1810120	1817640	actually uses the weight measurement of stone in Europe that's retarded she weighs 84 pounds okay
1817640	1824720	yeah and she was so upset about being called fat she ate the board for not for nine and being 84
1824720	1830880	pounds that's not really no it's not it you know it is unfortunate and for being 10 years old yeah
1830880	1835560	you have to remember though it is just a game I mean I kind of compare this to the fact that
1835560	1841880	in brain training like when you try to say blue it doesn't pick it up you go blue blue and it doesn't
1841880	1847480	listen to you and you go brew and it listens to you you know what I'm not a lot of starving
1847480	1851720	herself in order to become a model you know nowadays it's a competitive market out there
1851720	1857160	and just a fit is telling the truth actually they've actually been sort of showing a trend
1857160	1862440	lately now where the super skinny you know rail thin model is no longer being considered
1862440	1867480	attractive by a lot of companies that's all right I know what I get we fit it's not gonna say I'm
1867480	1876680	overweight it's gonna say get off me being thin causes cancer haven't you heard that is the new
1876680	1881380	thing actually they actually um there's plenty of studies showing right now and by the way her BMI
1881380	1888640	is only 18.2 which also BMI is bullshit it was created by somebody in the 1800s to do a study
1888640	1898720	of body masses in Poland I'm not joking so anyway anyway um the the whole thing now is that they're
1898720	1903700	actually the studies are out there saying that it's better to be quote overweight and active
1903700	1912560	than be rail thin and inactive gs68 says love handles greater than exposed ribs oh hell yeah
1912560	1917440	I mean you gotta have something to grab on to you know I don't want to you know I wouldn't want to
1917440	1922640	date some guy that I had to you know if I grabbed a hold of him I'd like poke a hole through my hand
1922640	1932160	by his hip bone or ow I know I think sorry skeletons aren't sexy skeletons belong in a
1932160	1936720	grave and I always pronounce mispronounce his name in chat I apologize I'm Hippolytus says
1936720	1941240	brain training 2 has no blue well that's good that might make the sequel worth it alone cuz
1941240	1946560	I'll tell you that blue thing was very frustrating but alright so hopefully I don't know maybe
1946560	1951360	they're tweaking the game so that it doesn't you know tell people they're overweight over
1951360	1956600	here cuz I'll tell you what there's a lot of Americans who are like pussies and and they're
1956600	1962080	gonna really be upset if you think one ten-year-old girls all you got over there it's awesome they
1962080	1972760	spent $100 on this game and then they go home and cry oh really yeah I took the game to tell you
1972760	1976800	that so this is what you need it so listeners and everybody that's gonna be buying this game
1976800	1982880	here in America this is your this is your chance to practice your attitude okay cuz you know you
1982880	1987520	got to have attitude so here's the thing is that when the game tells you that you're fat you go I
1987520	1994080	am and that's more of me to love you just have to yell back at the game now the whole the whole
1994080	2000320	point is just you know to just get out and do something that's the whole reason why I think
2000320	2008200	that we fit exists is just so that you're not sitting around playing a game you're up and doing
2008200	2015480	something I think I think that it doesn't matter what a game that is not that first of all does not
2015480	2022400	see what you look like does not know who you are has no concept of what your life is like giving
2022400	2028000	you a judgment based off of arbitrary information that has been entered into its programming to
2028000	2035080	judge you by this is called you know what suck it up that's what it's called or to quote Dennis
2035080	2042280	Leary shut the fuck up we need a sequel called we fat that's specifically for like you know fat
2042280	2047760	and fabulous people that should be that should be like the sequel well at the point of the game is
2047760	2054040	just to get up and do something no and then in seriously are seriously that's kind of been I
2054040	2060720	mean that's why the we has sold gazillions of consoles as it is and we sports is because we
2060720	2066440	has that persona of oh it's a video game but you get up and you do things and you play I mean come
2066440	2072240	on you that's what I don't when I'm playing it look I'm not talking about you or necessarily the
2072240	2076880	hardcore gamers I'm talking about the soccer mom of the world their perception of this when they
2076880	2081920	see it on TV and they see it at friends houses at parties and things they see people up and they see
2081920	2088280	kids jumping around and swinging the tennis racket or believing they are whatever I've really actually
2088280	2093880	I'm kind of been enjoying this trend from Nintendo lately where their games aren't just about fun
2093880	2099800	they're about fun plus improvement it's cut yeah it's kind of like brain training mm-hmm or you
2099800	2106480	know we've got our Wii games that get us up and moving Konami has had their similar games too I
2106480	2111360	think it's more or less there's been all this complaining about oh video games you know rot
2111360	2116360	your mind and you know you sit on the couch and don't do anything and blah blah blah blah blah
2116360	2123560	but now they're making doing something exercising your intelligence working your brain working your
2123560	2129440	body they're making it fun I don't think so I think this is the whole it's basically they're
2129440	2133960	following the money they're trying to figure out what gimmicky things they can do to get people
2133960	2139600	that normally play games to play these things and buy them I mean that's why they're focusing on the
2139600	2144880	brain training stuff because people think oh it'll make me smarter I I need I need to be smarter
2144880	2150120	because smarter is good and then you know the whole like Mario Kart and that stupid wheel
2150120	2155280	attachment oh well that's pretty neat let me get that game it's like I'm driving a real car except
2155280	2160600	you're not and then you know just like the Wii Fit oh make me I'll make me all fit I cuz you know
2160600	2165320	I could use a good workout and then they'll come out with something else that's retarded and people
2165320	2169560	will buy it too and that's their target audience they don't give a shit about improving anybody
2169560	2173880	all they care about is improving the amount of people that use their system and buy their
2173880	2182600	products that is it I thought that we fit looked kind of fun I I'm gonna buy it I got the whole
2182600	2186240	reason that I would want to play it is just because it looks fun and I like doing active
2186240	2191320	things I I have to admit that's kind of the reason why I'm gonna get it too is that yeah it will kind
2191320	2196120	of get me off the couch how long it will last though that's the question I want to still want
2196120	2202280	to reenact DD overnight comments in chat Hippolytus says brain age tells you you're dumb we fit tells
2202280	2208560	you you're fat Gerardo mo says both of them together tell you you're fat and dumb and Nintendo
2208560	2216160	is about demoralization apparently so hey quilt hippo says can we have soul training please they
2216160	2222480	should they should have we we morals there's something like that wheel of morality turn turn
2222480	2228880	turn show us the lesson that we should learn that's the lesson is that's the game they need on we
2228880	2234720	they need some type of moral moral lesson game and every kid in America should play already we
2234720	2239360	already get other people's moral shot on our throat every time your game's doing it well I
2239360	2245040	forgot to mention um I think this week too I know it wasn't on that launch list but I'm pretty
2245040	2249560	positive that it's one of the we wear launch titles remember there's also the major league
2249560	2256980	eating game that comes out as well so you know got a game for the fat people got a game for the
2256980	2261480	people that don't want to be fat anymore oh my gosh I'm looking at Justin TV chat and one of our
2261480	2269320	listeners in Japan Akuma JP says they do have we moral there it's Japanese tradition training
2269320	2275800	they actually do have a game like that in Japan that's great of a cultural and that's all it needs
2275800	2279360	to be here too I don't think they should have morals down throat but they should you know have
2279360	2289800	you know common sense type things you know like you know sense don't call people ugly names good
2289800	2296680	idea bad idea idea or we driver training on Halloween bad idea trick-or-treating on st.
2296680	2303520	Patrick's Day yes that type of I don't know how you make a game out of that like maybe like when
2303520	2308480	you lose chainsaw man comes and cuts your head off I don't know we'll see like Resident Evil 4
2308480	2315360	mixed with wheat all right forget it let's move on yes 68 demands P training okay now this topic

2406760	2410760	should petition Nintendo you know we won't get over here cuz people have corn cob shoved up
2410760	2417280	their butts and not now and I need to play some we ethics and not even the good vibrating kind
2417280	2428240	because it'd be a little that'd be a little bit less okay quick next story there's well
2428240	2434960	well tippos readying his man beam says ready your man beam Tony oh sorry well there's this
2434960	2440360	company that's matrix software you may not know them by their you know company name but you know
2440360	2446080	them from their games they have done the Final Fantasy 3 remake for the DS and are working on
2446080	2453120	the Final Fantasy 4 remake for the DS well now they're working on their own game as well called
2453120	2463560	Alundra and are I hell with that Alundra it was a fun RPG yes it was originally I guess released
2463560	2471120	on the US on the PlayStation by working designs and wait that's just remake of another game then
2471120	2479040	that's not even a new game well whatever anyways art was done by Toriyama it says the latest
2479040	2487520	project I guess is another original piece this time from marvelous and it's called Avalon code
2487520	2494160	is the new game I guess because they did the London for the PlayStation and Avalon code it
2494160	2499080	doesn't really say what it is but of course it's gonna be kind of done in the similar style as you
2499080	2503200	know the Final Fantasy remakes you know kind of a 3d type of game they said with the art style
2503200	2508920	similar to Crystal Chronicles so yeah not Alundra they're not doing a new Alundra game but Avalon
2508920	2517720	code is a new game it looks spiffy so we're not getting a London no no London that they did they
2517720	2524200	originally I guess developed a London for the PlayStation but they're not okay I get it now
2524200	2533360	my my mistake well new DS colors abound and in the US it was just a matter of time before this
2533360	2538680	color made its way over here it is it's a rumor right now though it's coming from some GameStop
2538680	2548520	insiders so what if the color is metallic rose is supposed to be coming over here that is absolutely
2548520	2553680	the first time I've ever heard of that really absolutely first absolutely first time pretty
2553680	2564720	sure this has never been mentioned on the show before right never also over in Germany some
2564720	2569680	German retailers have also listed some other DS light colors that are supposed to be coming out
2569680	2576120	in Europe and that is light blue red and green and they all come with matching stylus colors and you
2576120	2581600	know with the metallic rose being such a pink girly color mm-hmm I wouldn't be surprised if
2581600	2586360	they maybe I don't know got rid of pink or something hmm yeah so like they might be good
2586360	2590840	to get rid of pink all together yeah that maybe cuz you know I mean what's the point I mean there's
2590840	2595520	not that many girls out there that need a new system and metallic rose that's just that'll do
2595520	2599920	just fine I agree it will there be a comparable boy color coming out to you I don't I don't know
2599920	2604600	about that I mean cuz you've got black and white it takes a real man to enjoy pink I know I want
2604600	2615040	metallic rose metallic rose now sans you know was it nintendo screening your color I want hmm I want
2615040	2621600	death metal black Gerardo mo once sparkle in our chat room I'll be great I like sparkles I want
2621600	2628320	death metal black like chrome no I want like red black how about see through have red black they
2628320	2633200	do have red black I like the dark dark dark dark dark red that like look like you're looking to
2633200	2640240	obsidian get a red get a red black DS and set it far away you know I could get a dark black DS and
2640240	2644760	then use like transparent red paint on it and customize it myself you could I like customize
2644760	2648760	my DS you know if you go to the Nintendo store they sell those custom DS as you can get in all
2648760	2653400	those different colors I almost I would like so million I came so close to buying one because I
2653400	2660040	am a consumer and how maybe that's all spend my stimulus check on I'll fly to New York and buy
2660040	2665720	one of those DS's I'm just gonna customize my own I'll make my own skins I'm not really gonna do
2665720	2671720	that by the way all right let's get to some Rob I am crazy let's get to some release dates we'll
2671720	2679120	start off in the UK Jamie sweet release dates we have on the 14th assault heroes 2 on Xbox 360 on
2679120	2689200	the 16th is the rest of these we have de blob on we have dream pinball per PC and for we Iron Man
2689200	2697480	on PC Perry Rodan on PC whatever that is Silent Hill origins on PlayStation 2 and you all have
2697480	2704240	to get it now or at least on the 16th and then supreme ruler 2020 which is a game about me I
2704240	2710680	think dark soccer I think dark soccer should do like commercials for gaming companies you know
2710680	2716400	de blob look pretty good they're kind of comparing it to like a katamari tip game hmm just with paint
2716400	2725440	I'd have to see a demo it looked cool look cool in the US there's not a whole lot coming out of
2725440	2729940	this week I guess it would be an exciting week if you liked I don't know Chronicle and Narnia
2729940	2734600	Prince Caspian because there's a few games coming out for that well I wouldn't have to do with the
2734600	2740980	movie coming out this weekend or maybe yeah yeah 360 DS PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 I believe the
2740980	2747520	Wii version is coming out next week for some reason this week though we've also got castle
2747520	2753760	of shikigami 3 if you like your really crazy shooter games you know kind of similar like
2753760	2762240	Ikaruga that's probably worth the $29.99 deca sports which we showed off on this show here a
2762240	2768520	little bit that's coming out this week as well also another $29.99 pretty cheap there we ski
2768520	2775120	also another $30 game that's supposed to be pretty fun little skiing game also supporting
2775120	2783600	the Wii balance boards so you can lean on that that's kind of cool drone tactics for the DS kind
2783600	2792440	of a weird mechanical insect tactical game from Atlas and then we've got missed for the DS which
2792440	2801480	you know just missed and you know it's it's just missed it's just missed yeah and I believe that's
2801480	2806680	pretty much it I think for this week remember that hilarious theme song the deca sports game
2806680	2813040	had oh my god we need to get that that's funny that's in our Justin TV archive by the way if you
2813040	2817000	go to a Justin TV and you get back in the archive you can find that that was the best part about
2817000	2821120	that game was the really weird theme song that they had the game was kind of fun it was like
2821120	2828480	Wii Sports it's almost like a Wii Sports 2 in a way almost it's like a fun little party game
2828480	2834520	doesn't have that Nintendo touch I can't explain it but you know see well Nintendo just doesn't
2834520	2842800	have you know the really cool cheesy theme song so all right let's move over to Japan and look at
2842800	2848560	what kind of releases are coming out over in Japan not a ton of stuff this week but better
2848560	2853800	than last week we're like nothing came out the darkness makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week
2853800	2859880	that's really the only big release on the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 not a lot for you this week
2859880	2865280	although there's a couple things next week but I'll tell you about those next week coming out on
2865280	2873120	the Nintendo Wii Totsugeki Famicom Wars versus you might know that as Battalion Wars 2 that is
2873120	2877440	coming out on the Nintendo Wii and it's not price reduction because I thought they had that way
2877440	2884760	before us um no they want if you want to import it it's gonna cost you 65 bucks so I don't think
2884760	2888480	that's a price reduction huh I thought they had that a long time ago you know it's weird Japan
2888480	2893180	has been getting some releases like kind of maybe they're like releasing them or something
2893180	2903600	perhaps on the PlayStation 2 always Shiro is coming out and that also is getting a limited
2903600	2908160	edition version coming out it is let's see what this game looks like it looks like some type of
2908160	2916460	RPG I'm thinking no I don't know it has a little cutscenes that based on anime there's no actual
2916460	2921560	game screens I can find just cutscene I'm gonna guess it's a dating maybe it's a dating sim when
2921560	2925280	in doubt dating sim no it's an it's some type of adventure game that's the category it falls into
2925280	2933600	okay let's see also coming out a slaughter up core 10 mock go go go to that is and that's
2933600	2943440	slaughter SLO tter not like murder with a pickaxe that is speed racer it looks like because it has
2943440	2952920	the guy from speed racer on the cover yeah classic racer so some type of game oh god it's like a slot
2952920	2958640	machine game that has a good slide and speed eraser how lame it looks like you unlock clips
2958640	2964360	from speed racer as you play the slot machine well my hopes for that game went way down fast
2964360	2972280	I was gonna mention also this week on Xbox live arcade we're getting assault heroes 2 nice which
2972280	2982640	look okay the first one's alright and rocket man it came from Uranus that's on a 360 or Xbox live
2982640	2989920	arcade and the PlayStation Network this week so mature we are here at orange launch radio yeah
2989920	2995800	if you have rockets coming out Uranus you might have a problem rocket man it came from Uranus
2995800	3006720	coming out on the Nintendo DS dungeon of wind aria luminous art 2 and mahjong navi ds yet another
3006720	3011280	mahjong title because you just can't have enough mahjong let's see if there's anything on the PSP
3011280	3020640	yeah bleach heat the soul 5 comes out before the Sony PSP so check that out those are your
3020640	3030160	Japanese release dates for this week May 15th and good for them good for them well here's some
3030160	3037480	very interesting yet fun news for us is that burnout paradise is going to have a PC release
3037480	3047200	and criterion said okay here so they're going to be actually rebuilding it so that it works pretty
3047200	3053560	well on PC they're in enhancing multiplayer they're doing community content online features
3053560	3064200	and resolution is at night 1920 by 2400 and is pretty much straight from the original I'm kind
3064200	3074000	of curious what community features is going to entail sex somehow doubt that sex somebody break
3074000	3082840	dark soccer this week what is up I guess all right well that that should be interesting see the sick
3082840	3087520	thing is now I'm actually picturing that like how would that work in burnout paradise I don't know
3087520	3094040	brings a whole new meaning to take me down to Paradise City so that could be interesting
3094040	3098800	although I gotta say like you really are gonna have to have either some type of joystick with
3098800	3103480	analog control or like a wheel for your PC to enjoy this game because I would think controlling
3103480	3107800	with the keyboard would just be ass well it's like I think back to like test drive and the
3107800	3112600	Commodore 64 and as cool as that game was trying to play it with a keyboard was stupid well just
3112600	3118040	remember that all the games for Windows stuff nowadays supports the Xbox 360 controller and
3118040	3123480	of course the racing we wait wait wait if you have an Xbox 360 controller why don't you have a 360 and
3123480	3129920	then you just buy you feel like a pro PC gaming but you're like I'm not that into PC gaming where
3129920	3136480	I need to use the control is the audience for that that big I played crisis with a 360 controller
3136480	3145080	me fine I'm not that into PC gaming so well the hooray for PC gamers because burnout paradise is
3145080	3151080	a solid game and I'm sure they'll be enjoying that yeah another game coming to PCs everywhere
3151080	3157320	everyday shooter is coming to steam and that was a pretty awesome game on PlayStation Network I
3157320	3162280	would know though because I hate having to put my credit card information on the PlayStation Network
3162280	3171040	so until those cards come out I won't buy it but it looks cool so that's 10 bucks and I think is
3171040	3177000	available now everybody shooters available on PlayStation Network now but not steam yet or is
3177000	3185520	it on steam now it might be on steam right now I'm actually I think it's available now hmm orange
3185520	3190400	on radio giving you definitive gaming news every week and we think it's out there it's out there
3190400	3194480	now all right I'm like I could log on just if I didn't think it would disrupt the all-game stream
3194480	3198600	I would log into stream or steam right now just to check you know I have to get that audio surf
3198600	3202480	game to on steam I keep hearing good things about that the only thing I bought on steam is portal
3202480	3214320	not anybody cares yeah so movie news more video games becoming movies one game that has been opted
3214320	3222240	apparently for a movie I guess what's going on is that Naughty Dog has made the game uncharted
3222240	3229960	Drake's Fortune and it's been optioned by Atlas Entertainment so that means that it is possible
3229960	3233920	that in the next few years uncharted Drake's Fortune could actually actually become a movie
3233920	3238200	now when I think about video games that I want to become movies this isn't really one that pops
3238200	3242760	right into my head but okay I think it could work though because it's not cut much of a stretch it's
3242760	3252520	just you know action adventure thing mm-hmm so uncharted the movie may be coming to a theater
3252520	3260840	near you in about two years we'll see we'll see well there's other movies in talk actually says
3260840	3268680	that it's already in development is a Bioshock movie to be put out by Universal with Gore
3268680	3280160	Verbinski as the director it seems so hey that's kind of cool you did your to the Caribbean and it
3280160	3287200	also looks like they've got John Logan as the screenplay writer well they've made a lot a lot
3287200	3292320	more with a lot less so you know the thing about Bioshock though is that when I play Bioshock it's
3292320	3296800	kind of like watching a movie you know what I mean like I don't know like we're getting to this point
3296800	3300400	where games are so realistic they don't have to be made into movies because they already kind of feel
3300400	3307360	like movies does that make sense nope sorry not hearing you but uh doesn't mean that they won't
3307360	3314120	make a movie out of it all right fine well it's just you know if there's money to be made they're
3314120	3319520	gonna make the money yeah right I hear ya but I don't know there's just there's other games that
3319520	3323640	I would want to see made into movies first like some of the other Final Fantasy games I don't know
3323640	3329560	but maybe that's just the family you know one good Final Fantasy movie and that was Advent Children
3329560	3340000	yeah yeah oh well well Grand Theft Auto 4 talking about it again of course its first week sold or
3340000	3349280	made half a billion dollars isn't bad I guess selling the 6 million copies and 3.6 million of
3349280	3357080	those the first day so that's pretty awesome and I'm sure well they're expecting I think to do
3357080	3362520	another you know a total of a billion dollars by the end this year so which is even bigger than a
3362520	3366600	movie yeah you know the only movie that made that much money in the u.s. league is that an
3366600	3371800	international figure or just a u.s. figure it's international okay well still I mean Titanic is
3371800	3376840	like one of a few only very very few movies is made a billion internationally you know what I
3376840	3386680	mean most of that is in I want to say in the u.s. because the UK I read only sold like about 900
3386680	3393320	just under a million units so only there's a lot of games oh well I mean just under a million when
3393320	3398320	you know about you know five millions coming from the u.s. I'd say that's a majority of you know the
3398320	3405360	sales there all right fine but still yeah it's gonna do very well I mean it's been what parodied
3405360	3410440	on a bunch of different things now if it's on Saturday Night Live and Conan so although it's
3410440	3414680	kind of lame I don't know it was a little stupid but yeah I mean it's definitely hitting the
3414680	3420840	mainstream so all right I got to back up in stories and talk about the Bioshock movie because
3420840	3424720	there's some comments from chat chat that orange launch radio.com act-deaf wants to know will the
3424720	3429320	main character save the Little Sisters or not Quill Tippo wants to know will Johnny Depp star
3429320	3436680	as a spinny slicer and Brahma says just because the fan base is massive that does not mean the
3436680	3442640	fans will buy it possibly talking about buying into a Bioshock movie I'd see it I actually see
3442640	3446360	it too just kind of out of curiosity I would be kind of curious how they'd approach that too
3446360	3449920	though because you know there's the whole Little Sister thing and you can do very good things are
3449920	3455640	very bad things depending on your moral compass I need we ethics to help me make the decision here
3455640	3466840	here hold on a second okay it says I should kill you we ethics as a yeah it's not your day magic
3466840	3474840	eight ball real of morality turn turn turn show me which person I should burn that's the best
3474840	3484680	ever Oh outcome not favorable yeah sorry fire all right APB is a game that is coming out from real
3484680	3490080	time worlds and real time worlds they are they just bought the distribution rights to the game
3490080	3495880	it's a big MMO coming out and basically they're making no shame about this they are saying they
3495880	3501000	want to try and get this to Rockstar as Grand Theft Auto online yeah originally real-time
3501000	3507140	worlds they actually developed a game and they had sold the rights to I remember who the hell they
3507140	3511360	sold it to well they sold it to somebody but they bought it back anybody back because you know APB
3511360	3517000	will real-time worlds to crack down you know awesome sandbox game and this one's kind of like
3517000	3525040	it's a grant or sandbox online game basically where we have half the people are cops half of
3525040	3531600	them you know our crooks and all sorts of chaos is going on so it's like a cross between cops and
3531600	3537640	robbers Saints Row Grand Theft Auto online so it's not bad so yeah it'd be pretty easy as long as
3537640	3541680	there are guns and rocket launchers I'm sold it's it looks pretty awesome that's the one they had
3541680	3547520	during the tech demo they had the it was like all the is during game developers conference they had
3547520	3554720	the custom characters and one of them was Shiggy oh yeah it was with the mark over the mushroom
3554720	3560240	boxers and oh yes very awesome character creator now we should say though right now this is in
3560240	3564880	rumor status it's not confirmed shares if it comes out as a PPL still played it's awesome
3564880	3574960	all right fanboy much yes hey I like my sandbox games what can I say well they like you too
3574960	3583040	all right well let's move on with our next story well what's the best part about Mortal
3583040	3589800	Kombat Rob um katana what does everybody else think the best thing about Mortal Kombat is
3589800	3598880	Rob uh friendships fatalities oh yes fatalities so of course as we know Midway said that Mortal
3598880	3607280	Kombat vs. DC was going to be a t-rated fighting game with you know no fatalities but what it is
3607280	3616920	is they're not going to be as outrageous as they were but they are modifying the fatalities they
3616920	3622360	are going to still be finishing moves in there remember the last time they modified fatalities
3622360	3632640	for the Super Nintendo release sweat yo yeah all I gotta say and honestly though I'm going to
3632640	3639120	reserve judgment but I only want that game to play as Batman so whatever amen but see it's it
3639120	3648120	is all about that one quote he says I'm the goddamn Batman it is sacrilegious though to
3648120	3653640	perform a fatality on Batman that's what I still don't get he can perform fatalities all he wants
3653640	3658360	although Batman I don't think really kills people like he does now well yeah I mean like in in the
3658360	3662680	movies usually when people die it's their own fault like Batman didn't like try to kill them
3662680	3667240	they just died you know what I mean depends on who's actually Batman at any given time in the
3667240	3673760	comics but see the Batman God in my world is Adam West from the 60s Batman and he never killed no
3673760	3678440	one so really Batman shouldn't be doing fatality I didn't kill him it was gravity that killed him
3678440	3684320	gravity and the sudden sudden stopping it was it was an accident he fell down an elevator shaft
3684320	3696960	on his bullets there you go yes anyways games like Mortal Kombat have been claimed before to turn
3696960	3704760	children into bloodthirsty killers but Harvard says otherwise because you know Harvard everybody
3704760	3710360	they're super smart right so we gotta listen to what they say or rich or rich hey well that's even
3710360	3715920	more reason listen to them a pair of Harvard researchers say violent video games don't turn
3715920	3721520	children into killers their parents do according to a newly published book Grand Theft Childhood
3721520	3727520	the surprising truth about video games what parents do psychologists Lawrence Kuttner and
3727520	3733680	Cheryl Olson this spell of course common myths about video games and apparently they found during
3733680	3740880	their two-year study that there was no data to support any connection between games and real-life
3740880	3746920	fire this is not the first time I've heard of this book it sounds pretty good no and says they
3746920	3754400	studied 1200 middle school children in a 1.5 million dollar or federally funded study and
3754400	3760440	says instead of studying children in the laboratory like other studies they actually sat down talk to
3760440	3767520	kids after long bouts of game playing sometimes in excess of 15 hours a week lucky kids I guess
3767520	3773280	we're playing a variety of games from nonviolent The Sims I don't know depends how you play The
3773280	3784760	Sims my Sims sessions are pretty violent so to was it a Grand Theft Auto and they discovered
3784760	3790520	children who played violent video games those rated mature or above were just relieving stress
3790520	3796560	some children did exhibit playful fighting after playing games but it was similar to have what
3796560	3803600	children have done always after watching action or karate type movies 51% of the male children who
3803600	3811640	played for 15 hours or more a violent video games per week were involved in fights in the past year
3811640	3820920	compared to 28% Oh who yeah compared to 28% who regularly or played regular video games doesn't
3820920	3828520	make much hmm I guess who did not play video games anyways articles got the wrong text there
3828520	3836880	for girls 40% of the violent game players were in fights compared to I guess 14 of the nonviolent
3836880	3843240	players now so despite these figures I guess Kuttner and Olson say this is just a correlation
3843240	3849520	and that fighting was probably due to underlying psychological problem the children had before
3849520	3856400	playing video games I like how they just kind of just they're all you know even though the data
3856400	3863800	suggests that you know they may be prone to more violence just ignore that I'm very curious about
3863800	3867720	the book that's coming out though I actually might pick that up to read it it could be very
3867720	3872880	interesting I think it's already out no I know it just I think it just came out or it was like
3872880	3877040	about to come out like I think it was the thing I checked it out on amazon.com like about a month
3877040	3882160	ago and it was coming out like at the end of the month so I'm curious about it it's available now
3882160	3887120	well there you have it is that is it being widely distributed you think I could walk in any Barnes
3887120	3895000	and Noble and get it probably it says well right now on amazon.com you can get it for $16.50 all
3895000	3901840	right we are about to the end of this episode of orange launch radio part a anyway because there's
3901840	3907000	the whole part B that's coming up after a short break but we're doing something very kind of
3907000	3913200	unprecedented tonight during our live show we have I don't we haven't done this live ever since we
3913200	3918040	were still on life 365 and doing the three-hour show when there was no separate podcast and that
3918040	3926000	is tonight folks we are going to have a live cage match now here's the thing now live listeners
3926000	3931720	recognize this music because they know that after the show is done being taped for the night we like
3931720	3935920	to do some other silly segments at the end of the show and something we call the olr afterbirth and
3935920	3943000	usually we pick licensed songs you know from CDs out there that we enjoy in iTunes we put them up
3943000	3946920	against each other in this segment that we call the cage match well tonight we're doing something
3946920	3955160	a little bit different tonight the cage match is involving the grand theft auto for contest entries
3955160	3960960	that orange lounge radio received this week we have whittled it down to four finalists tonight

4013520	4019040	finalists sure first I want to say we got a lot of great entries and I wish we could play them all
4019040	4023160	but we'd have to do like a whole separate podcast or something so we had to narrow it down to four
4023160	4028200	but the important thing is you all made us laugh our asses off and that's the important thing all
4028200	4032520	right so you ready to get to the four finalists here we go the first finalist by the way let me

4051560	4056120	Theft Auto 4 but it had to incorporate Orange Lounge radio somehow like either one of our in
4056120	4061200	jokes or one of our hope you just had to do to have something to do with Orange Lounge radio all

4136240	4152000	night only on all games.com shows like pissing in an ocean of piss all right all right that
4152000	4156600	was entry number one coming to us from act death let's go around and give our thoughts on that dark
4156600	4166380	Sakura a little derivative I think so it gets a seven all right um look I would have given that a very high
4166380	4171520	score but look you made way too much fun of me and those are clips that like are like five years
4171520	4179280	old and I am so pissed off that they've resurfaced not really but you know whatever I just they were
4179280	4186840	taken out of context I'll also give it a seven Loki I can't read that high because it mainly relied
4186840	4192920	on clips of the show and to work it wasn't really that original you know so I'm gonna give it like
4192920	4198160	a five all right but remember it is not our votes that matter our votes don't mean shit we're like
4198160	4203200	Paula Simon and Randy we don't pick up you do in chat so if you think we're totally wrong Paula
4203200	4210280	and vote for your favorite yeah cuz I'm the one on crack all right here she's totally on crack all
4210280	4216640	right here is entry number two finalist number two did not sign their entry so I'm just gonna
4216640	4224960	say it's Ian Ian M is finalist number two here is finalist number two tonight hello I'm Smith
4224960	4232840	Weston and I'm here to talk about a growing threat to America Iraqi suicide babies they may look small
4232840	4245320	and cute but don't let a situation like this happen to America oh my what a cute baby wait a second
4245320	4259800	baby why do you have seen four chapter ways my opponent won't protect you from Iraqi suicide
4259800	4267840	babies in fact he refuses to believe they exist so vote Smith Weston for mayor the right choice
4267840	4280240	for America God the audio levels of these are all so different sorry guys all right that was entry
4280240	4286520	number two Ian M with the the Iraqi suicide babies ad what you guys think dark Sakura it would have
4286520	4294560	been funny if you hadn't been sitting into the microphone I the idea was was funny but the
4294560	4301040	execution of said idea but they're not professionals we have to go a little easy on them but that's why
4301040	4306920	you go back and listen to it and when you realize you're speaking into the microphone then you go
4306920	4313440	back and move the microphone away from your mouth you know so it gets a seven all right yeah it was
4313440	4317840	a little popping but he's for me that you know and this is a problem we even have on the show
4317840	4321560	sometime because we don't have sufficient mic guards and it would really depends on the mic
4321560	4326320	you use so I'm being a little more lenient because you might just have a junky mic the idea was good
4326320	4330960	though I actually would have added like some music or something to make it a little more upbeat but
4330960	4335360	maybe I didn't know how so I can't punish you for that but I think I think it's gonna be tough
4335360	4341960	against these other finalists but I'll also give you a seven Loki better if you had a lot more like
4341960	4348080	internet clips of like babies cooing or like and like explosions more explosions more baby sounds
4348080	4353160	and that I think that would have been like pretty awesome but I'll give you like a seven because it
4353160	4359200	was you know definitely more original and clean clips all right here comes finalist number three
4359200	4364960	tonight finalist number three in the Grand Theft Auto 4 contest is able to think here's his entry

4421280	4426800	it we I think there was actually a Grand Theft Auto 4 reference in that one which is is pretty
4426800	4433880	good and it's very pimp like Grand Theft Auto is so I I give that a seven as well but again the
4433880	4438160	same thing I told the last guy could I use some music to you know make it a little more you know
4438160	4446040	upbeat yeah same as the last one you know actually I'm gonna give this one six I like the voice the

4630600	4638440	in a minute and and the the the they were pretty much normalized too so give it a 10 i gotta say
4638440	4643000	it was pretty good i love that it was just i mean seriously like he's a scholar of orange
4643000	4648040	lounge radio in jokes it was one in joke after the other it just not like i love the part where dark
4648040	4654200	sakura uh could not participate because or because it would be like what did he say he said it was
4654200	4660200	because she was too she's too busy dying or no if if you hear it you will die in a fire it's no die
4660200	4665400	in a boat fire wall something like underwater volcano like every reference back to back in an

4790920	4795960	one more thing we got to get to before we can end part a tonight and that is uh getting to our
4795960	4800600	classic game of the week we got to pay respect to our elders a little bit because without our
4800600	4805400	elders in gaming there would be no grand theft out of four so uh dark sakura take it away and tell us
4806040	4812760	your classic video game of the week my classic game of the week is one that i have brought up
4812760	4821480	a number of times on the show which is one of the greatest shooting games of our is radiant
4821480	4831480	silver gun radiant silver gun is uh developed by treasure i have played this in the arcade and i'm
4831480	4836840	still trying to freaking find the saturn copy because i mean it's fucking radiant silver gun
4836840	4842200	hello and the good thing about this game this is one of the things that i always always liked is
4842200	4850920	that you had um your weapons were all available at the same time um your defense was all available
4850920	4857480	your different power ups um you could um do a regular forward gun called the vulcan you had um
4858040	4865480	homing missiles and you had a spread burst effect then you had like a lock-on spread you had one
4865480	4871400	that would shoot one beam in the front and then a ton of beams in the back you had um a plasma
4871400	4879000	weapon that sort of reminds me a little bit more um of the weapon the the uh electricity weapon from
4879000	4887320	uh riding dx remember except it was very thin and it would be blocked by um whatever happened like a
4887320	4893080	different uh items that were in the way um and then you had something called the radiant sword
4893080	4899640	which was a sword that could shoot out from either side um there was also a few uh
4901560	4905480	see you didn't actually have your power up you just level up your current weapons
4905480	4911160	um one of my favorite ones in here is these uh these two balls that come out right in front of
4911160	4916920	you but you shoot them out and they hover and then destroy whatever is in their way and um i also
4916920	4923800	like this sword that comes out from behind and then comes out in a wide arc and claps together
4923800	4929000	right right in front i think that's a very cool thing um it was very bullet heavy um
4929000	4937000	and like the one level that um rob's playing um on uh on the beat right now is of the whole level
4937000	4942440	where you're fighting just this big ship that it rotates around you and moves and you have to move
4942440	4952440	with it and it was a very very challenging game um the saturn version um had a few different things
4952440	4961080	as in it would um have you play through all of the stages um to unlock everything so
4963240	4968200	it was like you were having to play it in chronological order too it was very bizarre
4968200	4972920	to start off at three then two then four six then one so there's all kinds of kinds of weirdness
4972920	4979960	with it but it's treasure so we expect weirdness from them um but you've also got um four major
4979960	4986040	characters yeah four different characters to choose from um and each of them has their own
4986040	4993400	little quirks and everything you've got you know the cape girl and everything so um the um arcade
4993400	4999880	mode um would be played basically without the cutscenes or the dialogue but there was a saturn
4999880	5004680	mode that did have a bit more story involved and that dialogue and stuff like there's one
5004680	5008440	old stage that you play and this has got dialogue running all through the person's
5008440	5013640	part of the stage and and it's that you know sort of old man voice saying and we did this back in
5013640	5019480	the day and somebody shot somebody and there was a big war and a lot of people died so that's
5019480	5027080	radius over here it's freaking awesome it's treasure all right it's like a shooter but with
5027080	5032520	with uniqueness i don't know how else to explain it it's treasure i mean the only thing that you
5032520	5038600	can say about a treasure game is that it's freaking treasure all of their games where
5038600	5044200	they may seem like a straightforward genre you know that you've seen 50 million times they take
5044200	5050280	something in it and innovate it they do something that turns it around and makes it completely
5050280	5056920	different and that's you know and of course um they did um ikaruga which um contrary to popular
5056920	5061960	belief is not a true sequel it's radiant silver again it's more of a spiritual story and it's
5061960	5068440	spiritual sequels radiant silver gun but um i still honestly i think a radiant silver gun is
5068440	5074280	superior to ikaruga but that's me and if treasure knows what's good for them we will be getting
5074840	5081640	we will be getting more uh i guess uh re-releases of radiant silver gun
5082200	5089720	and they'll give them directly to me and only you and gs68 points out something that i was going to
5089720	5097000	mention is that radiant silver gun was inspired by image fight which was by um irm and that's the um
5097000	5102760	the team that gave us well the company that gave us our type and also completely unrelated to
5102760	5106760	radiant silver gun but since i mentioned our type i have to say this is that if you ordered
5106760	5111800	that r-type strategy game you get um an r-type we covered that last week but that's all right
5111800	5116680	i have one oh very cool you like it how big is it it's we couldn't figure that out on last week's
5116680	5121240	show three inches long huh it's fairly decent size okay i'll bring it next week and put it
5121240	5126360	on the cam so everyone can see all right but you know where i hate tactics games um i love
5126360	5130840	our types dan cavett so it cancels each other out and you're ambivalent about the game i was like
5130840	5136920	game i have i have the r-type thingy but no radiant silver yet it's treasure and i should
5136920	5141960	do nothing to treasure games like for the next couple weeks but i don't know what you know we
5141960	5146200	we got a game i was actually gonna originally do either you know i i've i'm gonna have to help you
5146200	5150120	out one of these weeks because i need to start seeing some commodore 64 11 these classic games
5150120	5155080	of the week no that's all right we've had a lot of good games oh we'll see we'll wait what what
5155080	5160840	system did jamie not have commodore 64 right oh we'll wait for a week you're not here because
5160840	5165080	there's they'll come up before the end of the year at some point this is not the most awesome thing
5165080	5168760	ever it is a very cool looking game you know i you want no secret i've never played this game
5168760	5172360	i played it the only time i've actually played this game is in an arcade you know whenever we
5172360	5176520	actually get our little uh justin tv idea off the ground that we need to do that because i need to
5176520	5183080	play what i did the very next day what's that i had lunch with sauce it was in las vegas very nice
5183080	5188680	so all right i have to say that on the air we are going to uh end the show right there at least part
5188680	5193080	a don't worry we're not ending the whole show there's still part b to come plenty more to come
