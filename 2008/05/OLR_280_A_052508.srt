Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, May 25th, 2008. Is Killer Instinct going to make a comeback?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A new computer chip promises to end piracy forever.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And will the 360 go without an update this spring?

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And yeah, we were out last week so we didn't have a show and part B from the week before took forever to get to the podcast feed.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But it's all better now, all better. We're fixed and ready to go.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'm ready to go tonight.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hopefully the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, also ready to go tonight.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hi.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are you well oiled and ready to go?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You know, like a machine.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I've had a hamburger, does that count?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sure, that works.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, then I'm well greased and ready to go to the bathroom.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Alright, sounds not hot.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Alright, also say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hello.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And are you well oiled and ready to go?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Uh, sure.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, you had a Subway sandwich earlier, so I know. How long was that Subway sandwich?

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That was like a two foot long sandwich.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It was a foot long, okay, and it was with the wrong bread because apparently this Subway was out of white bread.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That sandwich was bigger than my foot.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That was not a foot long sandwich, that was a foot long sandwich.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Alright, anyhow, sorry.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We are turning into Orange Lounge Foodio yet again.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Alright, joining us as well in studio, we have some guests tonight, which is good because we haven't had a lot of guests recently.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I've had to suffer this entire show with only Jamie and Matt.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
However, we have some guests tonight to help break that up a little bit.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Joining us all the way from Las Vegas is Tiara.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How are you?

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I can has American cheeseburger.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, you can has American cheeseburger. How are you doing?

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I am very good. I got nauseous on the way here, but now I'm fine.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Sorry to hear that. You are very, very quiet. They're having a hard time hearing you, so don't be afraid to get that thing real close to your mouth.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Because remember, it's normally wired for Jamie, who can get kind of loud.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Alright, yeah, that's right.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm just teasing.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Alright, well we're glad to have you. So you feel free to chime in whenever. Take Jamie's mic, I encourage it.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Just kidding.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know why I'm giving Jamie a hard time tonight. I heart Jamie. She knows that.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Right, you know that?

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm going to throw that ferret in the fire.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Drewnami.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Rawr.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How are you doing, Drew?

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm Rawr.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're Rawr?

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Rawr.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I like the interactive radio that was going on before the show, by the way.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here's what happened. We're live on Justin TV. We do our cam thing, although I got to tell you, the cam kind of sucks tonight because I dropped the iSight webcam and the audio doesn't work anymore.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's not breaking it, Drew.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, it's having to use the actual audio from that little tiny mic thing on the actual, like if you look at the right side of the Mac, but you can see the little tiny mic thing, that's what it's using.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So our Justin TV is kind of hurting tonight.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But I guess one of our listeners actually saw that you were here and called your phone and got you to leave the room.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Ranma, you fucking suck. I just like to make that known.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But Orange Launch Radio is interactive radio. It's the best thing ever because we get to interact with you guys. We love it.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And you can join us in chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, or our chat channel is Orange Lounge on the Game Surge Network.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Or you can always send us emails, mailbag.orangelaunchradio.com.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think we have a pretty full mailbag tonight, though, because it's been two weeks, so you may not want to send them just yet.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Wait till during the week.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And also our Skype line, which will be open later in the show at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But it would not be Orange Lounge Radio if we didn't talk about our gaming week.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And since we've got some time to catch up on, tonight's question is how is your gaming two weeks?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So Dark Sakura, how is your gaming two weeks?

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We played Rock Band today, and I played pinball a lot. I went to Pin-A-Go-Go the weekend before.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How was Pin-A-Go-Go? Because we didn't get to hear about it because we were out that week.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It was hot, smelly, and hot. And smelly.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do pinball players not bathe or something?

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't know, but this was at Dixon Farm Center of something or the other with Banquet Hall.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, when most people call Sacramento a cow town, you're actually probably thinking of Dixon.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Moo.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Anyway, but I did get to play the Black Rose before it went down, and Dan brought his No Fear, and Will brought Judge Dredd, which is not my favorite table.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But anyway, I really played. I tried to go back and play some really old stuff and some things I hadn't seen before, but I could not get on Theater of Magic at all.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And no one brought like a medieval madness. There was an Addams Family there.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Nice.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But it was by this point, it's a lot of machines that I know if I want to play them, we know the people who own them.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So what exactly happens at Pin-A-Go-Go? You pay money to get in and just play all the pinball you want, or is it more of like it's supposed to be like a trade show for pinball enthusiasts?

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You've got your center area, which is all, in fact, there's actually two rooms.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The main room is where the newer tables are set up, the one with more, you know, I guess componentry and things.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And then there's an air conditioned dining hall that has older machines set up in there.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And I'm talking like, you know, 60s, you know, 50s, 60s, 70s machines.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But you basically, they're all put on free play and you pay your convention dues and you run around and, you know.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Frolick.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Frolick in the hot.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Play pinball.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But around the sides they have vendors set up.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
People who sell, you know, old tables that need some work, like a friend of ours got a Space Invaders pinball.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Nice.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
For like 150 bucks. It needs to be shopped really bad.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Does it have the groovy music from the new soundtrack?

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't know.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It should.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Probably not.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's old.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, probably not then.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And creepy looking too.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There are a couple of machines I did play quite a bit of.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Did they have the Jurassic Park pinball?

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That was one of my favorites because the dinosaur would come down and eat the ball.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That was always my favorite.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It had a fun house, which I hate because that head scares me.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But it had Captain Fantastic.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Captain Fantastic.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Which is the one with Elton John on it.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That was the machine in Tommy.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh yeah, he's fantastic, alright.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I have a picture of it. I'll put it on the camera.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Fantastic.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But I did play, one of my favorite was Black Hole.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Which, the cool thing about Black Hole is that you have an underside that you play under the field and you play it reversed.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, I've seen something like that.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't think it was, I think it was like, isn't there a swamp thing or a creature from the swamp or something like that?

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
An Elvira machine does it.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, okay.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But Creature from the Black Lagoon, which is what's in my house, just has a hologram of the creature.

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, no, I'm thinking of something else. Alright, that's fine.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But, um, Black Hole is a pretty, pretty nifty machine.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But, um, Dan finally got to play Black Rose, which is the one I want.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Which I think is much cooler than the new Pirates of the Caribbean game.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Which was there.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And Family Guy and Simpsons Pinball Party, which I have.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And no pin bot.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You know what?

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
There's a bride.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You know what pinball game I haven't played in forever that I want to play again?

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Revenge of the Gator.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That was the Game Boy one.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I know.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That was the first game I ever played with the link cable.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That one was fantabulous.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It was fantabulous.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But it was, overall it was a really good convention, but we ended up splitting so that we could go to, um, Mary's Pizza Shack.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Nice.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Where we didn't eat pizza.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We ate breadsticks.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And I had a milkshake.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The end.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Alright.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Loki, how was your gaming two weeks?

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Um, well, week one I played pretty much just all Grand Theft Auto IV, because I was attempting to go for 100% by that deadline.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And, not to say that I didn't try, because I took two days off work, played solid for four days, and still didn't finish it in time.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Um, it just got to the point where it wasn't even fun to play it anymore.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's fun to play it now though, but not fun to just do all the side missions and stuff.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I'm still going to do 100% eventually.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's just, you know, right now I'm like at 86.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, I have to kill all the pigeons.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And do stunts and stuff like that.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Uh, then I played a little bit of, um, Wii Fit this week.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And that's alright.

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You know, the balance board, it's not as fun as you would think it would be.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It really, it, I don't know.

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's just kind of stupid, some of the games that are on there.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And they're not really responsive.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But, whatever.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And then, um, I tried a little bit of, um, the Penny Arcade game.

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And that was pretty fun.

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Wait, I have to ask, when you got on the balance board, did it go, ow!

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, it didn't go, ow.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's all, you're obese.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Did your wife make fun of you? Was she watching you play?

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, she was watching me play with you.

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was just fun.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Um, but then, you know, the, uh, it said my Wii Fit age was 38.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So, I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Um, tried, like, a bunch of the mini games on there.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Like, the jogging and stuff.

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There's, um, apparently, uh, Xtifer and my wife said that, um,

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
the female trainer on there has a giant bulge.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like, she's got a package.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What?

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, apparently the female trainer is carrying, uh, some extra, uh, equipment.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't know. Kind of weird stuff there.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But, um, yeah, pretty much that was my gaming week.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Because that's all I've been really playing.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Um, multiplayer's still kind of fun.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's hit and miss, though, with the accuracy on it.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Because, you know, you'll be aiming at someone's head.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And, for whatever reason, it really favors if you crouch down when you're firing and stuff.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't know. It's just kind of cheap.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not as fun as you would have hoped it.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But it's not as broken as the PSP version.

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, that's also fun.

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Um, but, yeah, that's pretty much it right now.

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm still trying to get my audio video set up to work so I can, um, record some funny stuff.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Because I was, um, I was doing some...

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We were playing with some people and there's a, you know, a bunch of skate parks in there.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And you can take the motorcycles on the half pipes and stuff and do funny things with that.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Um, just all sorts of weird stuff.

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, my gaming week, um, you know, I was kind of sick last week.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Which you would think I would stay home and play games all day, but I really didn't.

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Although, I did, um, you know, it's...

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Gosh, it's been a while since we've had a show.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, you miss a week, miss a lot.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Because we haven't done a show since WiiWare came out.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like, that was, like, our last show was, what, May 11th?

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And so, literally the next day was when WiiWare came out.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So, I checked out Defend Your Castle because I'd played the Flash game a long time ago and I loved it.

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So, I decided to get the version for the Wii.

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And it's cute. Like, I love the graphics and the sound are hilarious.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because, um, they made all the graphics out of really quirky things.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Like, um, for one of the battering rams that some of the guys try to use on your castle.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There's little popsicle sticks that they use as the art.

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And, like, these giant monsters are made of Pepsi caps.

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Like, the tops of, like, actual Pepsi bottles.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Which is, um, kind of funny.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So, um...

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah, so that was, uh, that was...

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It was amusing. Defend Your Castle is very amusing.

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's very slow in the beginning.

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Like, you kind of have to stick with it for it to get really chaotic.

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And the kind of bummer thing about Defend Your Castle is that once you've kind of upgraded your castle fully,

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
there's not really a lot left to do.

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You just have to let it keep getting faster and faster and faster.

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But, it's only a $5 game.

224
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And, you know, compared to some of the $5 stinkers on Xbox Live,

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
it's, it's, it's... $5 is a fair price for the game.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I think it would be a fun party game, too, and it's obscenely simple.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I mean, it's cool to bring friends over and be all,

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
okay, here's what you do, pick up the guys with your controller,

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and then throw them up in the air and watch them die.

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I mean, that's... What fun is that?

231
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
An instant party, just add death.

232
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Uh, so, yeah, Defend Your Castle is kind of cool.

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Um, it's not a game that's going to amuse you on a long-term basis.

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So, though, if you're, if you're kind of like a single player looking for some games that are going to keep you involved for a long time,

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
from what I understand, you should probably go with Lost Winds or the, uh, Final Fantasy game.

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Uh, neither of which I've checked out yet because I'm out of space on my Wii drive.

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I, I know that.

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Completely out of space.

239
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It doesn't take much.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Jeez.

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So, but anyway, I'll save that bitching for another day.

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Uh, otherwise, I did check out the Penny Arcade game for a little bit.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I only checked out the demo, so I'm not going to try to give a full review of the game.

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But I did laugh my ass off, like, I thought the game was very amusing.

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The gameplay itself, you know, eh, I've seen it before, but I, I was amused.

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I'm sure fans of the comic are going to be insanely amused.

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Um, I hear it's short, but you know what?

248
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
How much does it cost to see a movie these days?

249
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like, ten bucks to go see a movie for ninety minutes?

250
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You know, it makes twenty dollars for four hours of entertainment not seem so bad.

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So, you know, I, I'm sure this game is, I, I am going to put down the money to buy it when I have a little more time to actually sit down and play it.

252
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Um, otherwise, I've just pretty much been playing WoW.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I have a friend who's trying very hard to get me to play Age of Conan.

254
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But, from what I understand, it's still crashing.

255
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Like, he's getting the blue screen of death when he's playing.

256
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And I'm like, dude, I haven't heard of anyone getting the Windows blue screen of death in like five years.

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So that's pretty hardcore.

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Um, so I'll check that out once it gets a little more stable.

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because you remember when WoW first came out?

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They had issues too.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I mean, WoW was shutting down systems left and right as well.

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, uh, yeah.

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So that's that.

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So, uh, otherwise, other games I've played, um, not a lot of new stuff.

265
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I went back and played some old retro stuff.

266
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Some old Xbox Live arcade games.

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's really it.

268
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Um, Tiara, I see you're playing a PSP right now.

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What are you, what are you up to?

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
How was your gaming weeks?

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What have you been playing?

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Um, well, I've been playing Final Fantasy Tactics for the PSP.

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's kind of interesting because I've played the PSX version through so many times.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And it's interesting to see how they've rewritten, like, the script and everything.

275
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Is it supposed to be, like, an upgrade of the original PlayStation 1?

276
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Or is it, like, a whole new story?

277
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Because I never really understood.

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This one is the exact same game.

279
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They've, uh, redone the translation.

280
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And now everybody talks like Thor from Marvel Comics.

281
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay.

282
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And, um, they have, like, some of the cut scenes are now animated.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So it's, you know, it's kind of interesting.

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Cool.

285
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Those cameos.

286
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And, um, there are two new classes that you can get.

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Onion Knight and Dark Knight.

289
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And so it's been pretty interesting so far.

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm only in the third chapter.

291
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But so far everything is pretty much the same.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The translation is slightly different.

293
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And so since the text is different, I'm sort of thrown off by it.

294
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Because I'm so used to seeing the cheesy, uh, old translation.

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That was like when I played Final Fantasy IV on the Game Boy Advance for the first time.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I was like, whoa, whoa, this is way different from what I remember on Super Nintendo.

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

298
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Because they really dumbed it down on Super Nintendo.

299
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But thank heavens they kept you Spoonie Bard in there.

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah.

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I was like, I had to play at least to that spot to see, like, did they keep Spoonie Bard?

302
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes?

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay.

304
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah.

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Other than that, um, I bought myself Iron Man for the PSP.

306
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And I've been playing that a little bit.

307
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I actually wrote a review for that.

308
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And it's in the mailbag.

309
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So I'm sure Jamie will read it later.

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Nice.

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And other than that, that's it.

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
All right.

313
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I notice your PSP is very shiny, by the way.

314
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You take good care of that PSP, don't you?

315
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You, like, you sign on that or something.

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's very, very well kept.

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, it's, well, I just got it last month.

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's why.

319
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Ah, okay.

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Because, um, it was, uh, like a kind of preemptive tax refund gift to myself.

321
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Like, I know the government's giving me $600, so why not?

322
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah.

323
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Exactly.

324
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And then I have, like, my little shield on it.

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And so it's, you know, that's why it's shiny.

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Very nice.

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Isn't it shiny?

328
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes.

329
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's one thing I noticed about the PSP.

330
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
All right.

331
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's shiny.

332
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Shiny.

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
All right.

334
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Drew, anything shiny in your gaming week?

335
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Not particularly.

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I've been playing, uh, well, I played some rock band today.

337
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Did okay, I think.

338
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Um, other than that, not much.

339
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I tinkered with La Mulana, but, uh, I guess I'm just that, not that hardcore anymore.

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay.

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Somebody needs to explain La Mulana with me because I know, I know we have tons of chatters

342
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that are obsessed with this game and, like, have been trying to get me to play.

343
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So sell me on La Mulana.

344
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What's, what's so rad about it?

345
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
In a nutshell, it's like a recreation of an MSX game.

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Obscenely difficult.

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's, uh, action adventure.

348
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And basically the goal is you're like this Indiana Jones type archeologist, and you want

349
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
to, uh, discover all the secrets in the ancient city called La Mulana.

350
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,800
Unfortunately, almost everything is a trap.

351
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,800
It's not, I don't, it's not, uh, I want to be the guy hard, but it's, it's definitely

352
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Battletoads hard.

353
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,380
That would be a great name for a game.

354
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,380
Everything is a trap.

355
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,520
I'm not sure how that works.

356
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,120
I'm not sure if that would be like, I don't know if you ever saw the movie cube like that

357
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
as a video game.

358
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,800
We were just discussing this earlier today.

359
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,400
Hypercube breaks my mind.

360
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Everything is a trap.

361
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,600
It's a trap.

362
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I like that.

363
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
That's a good name.

364
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,240
I like, I'm not sure.

365
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
Add that to our wishlist.

366
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Well, I don't know.

367
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,240
I don't know if it's able to add to the OLR wishlist because I'm not sure what the game

368
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,800
is yet.

369
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,880
That's the point.

370
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
You don't know what it is.

371
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Oh, because it's a trap.

372
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Okay.

373
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Okay.

374
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Yeah.

375
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Then I approve.

376
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
It can go on the OLR wishlist.

377
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Oh my God.

378
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,760
I've actually been playing through Metal Gear Solid 2.

379
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,200
I sort of gave up on the game a couple of years ago cause I suck at stealth games and

380
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,960
now I find I'm actually progressing.

381
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,640
Maybe it's the fact that I'm now playing on very easy, but Raiden is not annoying as I

382
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,880
thought it would be.

383
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
It's kind of interesting.

384
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,160
Isn't it weird when you like rediscover games that were out like five years ago?

385
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Yeah.

386
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Yeah.

387
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,120
Like, or like 10 years ago in the case when I was really sick and I was at my parents,

388
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,680
I was playing Soul Blazer.

389
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Oh God.

390
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Soul Blazer is awesome.

391
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
Soul Blazer is awesome.

392
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,400
Soul Blazer needs to come to Virtual Console for reals.

393
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,240
Like I don't think this made our show roll tonight, but I understand there was a little,

394
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,360
there was a little bit of shenanigans on the internet this week because I guess Kotaku

395
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,960
had posted, we want this game, we want Soul Blazer to come to Virtual Console and somehow

396
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,640
that got reported like on like G4 as Soul Blazer is on Virtual Console.

397
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
That was kind of funny.

398
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,080
That was very funny, but I agree with the guy who wrote it.

399
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,600
Soul Blazer does need to come to Virtual Console as does Illusion of Gaia, as does Terranigma.

400
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,520
Thank you very much.

401
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,080
Are you going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4 at some point, Junami, and the 50 hour cut

402
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
scenes are supposed to be in the game?

403
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Yeah.

404
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
If I can afford a PS3.

405
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Are you going to be watching Metal Gear Solid?

406
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,400
I shouldn't, I shouldn't ask people if they're going to be playing Metal Gear Solid 4.

407
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,880
It's just as are you going to be watching it?

408
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,240
No, I'll be busy watching Xenosaga.

409
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Oh, okay.

410
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,360
Of course, then again, when Final Fantasy 13 comes out, I'm sure it's going to be no

411
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,120
different where you just, you're going to be watching it.

412
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,760
I'll, I'll stick to my Tales of games for now.

413
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,680
I'm stoked for the Tales of Symphonia sequel for Wii.

414
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,760
My roommate who occasionally gets into games, like he was like obsessed with Puzzle Quest

415
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
for a little while and stuff like that, he loves Final Fantasy.

416
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
He'll touch anything that says Final Fantasy.

417
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,920
He was just asking me the other day, when's Final Fantasy 13 coming out?

418
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,600
Because like apparently I know everything about video games.

419
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,160
I'm like, um, 2010, if you're lucky.

420
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,200
If you're in Japan, you might see it next year.

421
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Yeah.

422
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Anyhow.

423
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,000
All right, let's get to gaming news after we take care of some housekeeping tonight.

424
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,600
First off, sorry about last week, we weren't here and that, uh, we decided we were going

425
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,820
to put out part B of the May 11th show a little late just to kind of spread it out when we

426
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,400
realized there wasn't gonna be a show this next, last week.

427
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,560
But then it ended up getting out really, really late and that was my bad.

428
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
So sorry about that.

429
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,360
This is up now, parts A and B of last week's show.

430
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,880
Grand Theft Auto IV contest.

431
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,560
If you listen to last week's show, you know that SSJ 100 Matt won our nomination into

432
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,760
the finals for the Grand Theft Auto IV contest.

433
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,440
I don't know who won yet.

434
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,200
What I can tell you is that it was, it didn't end up being a public vote.

435
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,020
That's not how they did it.

436
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,060
Each show that participated got a vote in the competition.

437
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,360
So in other words, we got to vote for any show that wasn't our own, basically.

438
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,840
And so the show that gets the most votes, that listener will win the super duper rare

439
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,520
Xbox 360 elite.

440
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,760
I can tell you that after much deliberation, and the three of us did this last week because

441
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,660
we didn't have a show, we made our top three list independently and it was so funny because

442
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,160
everything was like all around the board.

443
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:35,120
Like I don't, I don't think any of us had like any similarities in our list whatsoever.

444
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,520
Like Dark Sakura, I think had the Chatterbox show on her list, and Loki had the one with

445
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,340
all the dick jokes on his list.

446
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,340
Which one was that?

447
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
Was that the platform nation one?

448
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,340
Why am I not surprised?

449
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,920
That's because it was the most like a Grand Theft Auto commercial.

450
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
No, no.

451
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
I know it was.

452
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
And what did I have?

453
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,840
I had, I had video game outsiders on my list.

454
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,060
I remember that.

455
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:01,800
But in the end, the only one that actually ended up on all three of our lists was the

456
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,000
All Games Interactive one.

457
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,200
So that's what we ended up voting for.

458
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,860
And I don't have the MP3 handy, but it's really great because what they did is they cropped

459
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,240
Mary Young, who's on that show.

460
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,920
I guess he was like, he was having one of those, I'm all alone on the radio.

461
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,000
Like did you ever see Wayne's World when Garth was all alone having to do the show?

462
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,300
I guess Mary Young was having one of those moments and somebody actually remixed it to

463
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,200
music and it's hilarious.

464
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,720
He's actually singing like, I am alone on the feed.

465
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
It was really funny.

466
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Oh wait, look, I found it.

467
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I found it.

468
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Okay.

469
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Here's the one we voted for to win.

470
00:22:41,720 --> 00:23:11,560
All right, I'm not going to play the whole thing.

471
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,040
You can listen to their show if you want to hear the whole thing, but it was really funny.

472
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,360
So we voted for it, even though nowhere in there do they ever say it's All Games Interactive

473
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
or any of that.

474
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,400
And it really has nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto, but it was funny.

475
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,240
You ever seen that movie Shocker right before the guy's head exploded?

476
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,840
I do know, I don't think we've gotten a single vote so far.

477
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Poor Matt.

478
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,560
The problem is if it had been, see, we kind of got screwed by how they decided to do the

479
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,720
finals, which is fine because we didn't know how they were going to do it going into it.

480
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,920
We knew it could be anything, but with a public vote, at least we could have mobilized the

481
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
OL army.

482
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,260
And I think Matt would have done pretty well.

483
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,120
But the problem with having the other shows vote is I don't think they all listen to Orange

484
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Lounge Radio.

485
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,920
I don't think they'll listen to the rules of the contest either because some of those

486
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,000
entries is like, what the fuck is that?

487
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's like a bumper.

488
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's not even like a fucking commercial.

489
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
No, but that's okay.

490
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,880
I mean, bumpers were supposed to be okay.

491
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Okay.

492
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,820
But it's not, from what I understand, some shows did not get a lot of participation.

493
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,920
So I think they had to pick what they got.

494
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
Okay.

495
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Well, people should listen.

496
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,200
It's supposed to be like a Grand Theft Auto commercial, not a fucking commercial for...

497
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Wait.

498
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
This just in.

499
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,160
Apparently Bobby Black Wolf voted for our show to win.

500
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,360
So praise Bobby Black Wolf.

501
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Wait.

502
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
No one listens.

503
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
What do you think this is?

504
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
The internet?

505
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
So we know at least Matt won't get last place.

506
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,040
But see, Bobby probably liked it because Bobby listens to our show.

507
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,360
So he got all the votes.

508
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Got it.

509
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
Got it.

510
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,880
But I doubt the other shows are going to get it.

511
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
So we'll see.

512
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,760
All right.

513
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Moving on, moving on.

514
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Enough.

515
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,960
We'll let you know who actually wins next week.

516
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,360
I do want to give one more shout out to the All Games crew right now, because there's

517
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,560
a gal on there who I think we've all met, Jessica.

518
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,360
Have you guys met Jessica?

519
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,000
We've all met Jessica before, right?

520
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I don't know.

521
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,880
I think she was there at E3 one year.

522
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,800
She's the pretty gal who reads the news and all that stuff on their show.

523
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Well, that could be anybody.

524
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Yeah.

525
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,680
But Jessica is cool.

526
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,880
And she actually apparently is like, OK, I did not even know this was going on.

527
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,280
But there's this website, Massify.com, where they're actually casting a horror movie online.

528
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,680
Like people made YouTube-ish videos.

529
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,480
I sound like you said a horror movie.

530
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,960
No, a horror movie online.

531
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,900
Well, Jessica was a finalist.

532
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,100
Her thing was so popular.

533
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,120
She was one of the top 20, one of the top 10 girls.

534
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,380
They had her do a screen test.

535
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,520
And now she's a finalist.

536
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,520
And if she wins this, she's going to be in a movie.

537
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,160
She's going to be in a horror movie.

538
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,960
She's going to be victim number how much?

539
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I don't know.

540
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
Apparently, it's like a lead role if she wins this.

541
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
That's pretty cool.

542
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
That is very cool.

543
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,060
I hope, though, she has a no nudity clause in her contract.

544
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,060
She's a pretty girl.

545
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,060
They'll try to take advantage of that.

546
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,020
So Jessica, no nudity clause.

547
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,800
You better write that in your contract.

548
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:01,600
But anyway, if you want to vote for Jessica, we encourage you to Massify.com slash auditions

549
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,480
slash 739.

550
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,900
And I think you can only vote till Monday.

551
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,020
Her name is Chanteuse on the site.

552
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
So that's how you'll know.

553
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,320
And I'll post that there in chat.

554
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,240
So you all can go vote.

555
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,240
You do have to register for the site.

556
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,060
And they send verification emails.

557
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,780
But come on, in this day and age, who doesn't have a spam email account?

558
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
That all goes to us.

559
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,540
So I just registered my spam email account.

560
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:29,800
So Katamari's Forever in Chat says, the ferret will be in it as the slasher also.

561
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,300
Now that's an idea for a horror movie.

562
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,800
Maybe that could go in the everything is a trap game.

563
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,060
Maybe the ferret is the mastermind behind all the traps.

564
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,740
I didn't know the ferret liked slash.

565
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
It'd be wonderful.

566
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740
All right.

567
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Anyhow.

568
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,820
So go vote for Jessica.

569
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Make her happy.

570
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:50,240
And well, we also want to say we know somebody in a horror movie, but all right, again, I

571
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,300
just I just hope they wrote the nudity out because that would be awkward.

572
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,880
Like you know, like, oh, hi, Jessica, I think I saw you naked in a movie.

573
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
That's kind of awkward.

574
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
All right.

575
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Moving on.

576
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,220
Because chicks get naked in horror movies all the time.

577
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,780
So I'm just hoping she pulled the Jamie Lee Curtis, you know, and said, not not going

578
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
to happen.

579
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,780
All right.

580
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,580
Anyhow, let's get to our is very amused by the nudity talk.

581
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,580
Look, if you were cast for a horror movie, Tara, wouldn't you make them write a no booby

582
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,900
claws in the in the country?

583
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,780
You would want to see me naked anyway.

584
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,780
I know.

585
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,900
I'm sure there's plenty of boys who would like to see the Tatas.

586
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,900
But, you know.

587
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,900
Yes.

588
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
I mean, you guys are really selective on that.

589
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
All right.

590
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,260
It's like, oh, man, I got to look at moving on gaming news.

591
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,500
We do do gaming on this show once in a while.

592
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
Yes.

593
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
I know nothing.

594
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
We got a week to catch up on.

595
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Loki, catch us up.

596
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,620
What did we miss from the week of the 11th through the 18th when we were gone?

597
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,620
Absolutely nothing.

598
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,780
Except for the news for last week, including there was a bunch of gaming events that went

599
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,780
on, lots of stuff that we weren't invited to, of course.

600
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:06,100
And so we have a few different gamers days, of course, one we like to talk about Konami.

601
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:13,180
They had their gamer day recently and they announced a few things, including Rock Revolution,

602
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:20,660
their journey back into, I guess, the guitar drum music game because they've never been

603
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
there before.

604
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,980
It's like, you know, oh, my God, they finally arrived.

605
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
It's about time.

606
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:35,220
But, yes, not to be outdone by, you know, some other companies who had put out certain

607
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,500
games with drums.

608
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,900
They decided, hey, our drum thing is not going to look like a drum at all and it's going

609
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,060
to have like six buttons and we're going to be awesome because we're going to one-up everybody.

610
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:54,300
So, yeah, six drum pads, one kick drum and it looks like 40 songs with download content

611
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,900
planned, as well as the ability to record your own songs in a jam session with eight

612
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:09,500
separate tracks, online co-op versus Battle of the Bands mode and a weird drum pad.

613
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:15,340
We actually have the first confirmed song for the new Konami drum guitar.

614
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
What's it called again?

615
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,340
Rock Revolution?

616
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Yeah.

617
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:27,900
It's called the confirmed song.

618
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:34,900
No, I missed the bus.

619
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,500
You missed the bus, Konami.

620
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
You stole my joke.

621
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
You missed the bus.

622
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,100
Konami, you know what this is?

623
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,620
It's the sound of the boat you missed five years ago.

624
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:51,740
I just can't help but look at this and go, wow, that's, I guess, yay, yay, about time

625
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
they figured out.

626
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
Oh my God.

627
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
Rock and roll.

628
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
You can sell that.

629
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,860
I feel horrible saying this about Konami.

630
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,140
I feel really horrible saying this about Konami because, you know, they did kind of start

631
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
the whole guitar.

632
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,100
I mean, when they did it, they're like, but if only we could develop a guitar and drum

633
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
game.

634
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Can we do that?

635
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,780
And then like two years later, oh my God, we had one all along.

636
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,860
Why didn't you tell me?

637
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,980
Years ago on this program, and I think we've all said this, we've all said years ago on

638
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,340
this program, we said, Konami is going to miss the bus by not putting this game out

639
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
here.

640
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
Somebody's going to beat them to it.

641
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,520
And I'll be damned if we weren't right.

642
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,820
And that's how they innovate on it.

643
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,180
They make this really weird looking drum pad that looks like some cheesy toy.

644
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,980
And then they like, um, I don't know.

645
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,860
I can't imagine how this is going to be the U S R and D people at Konami are pissing themselves

646
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,420
and shooting themselves in the foot.

647
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:51,220
Well, you know, they got to diversify themselves somehow because now the market's really getting

648
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
crowded.

649
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,220
I got an idea.

650
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Fix beat mania.

651
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,220
Yeah.

652
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
Here's the mania is a great idea.

653
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,300
Dude, there are people that are going to miss the bus on that again too, because there's

654
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,980
that whole DJ hero that they're talking about putting out.

655
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,580
So once again, they're going to get beat by these other people that have the U S license

656
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,900
for cracking DJ.

657
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
I'm not sure.

658
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,260
I totally see this song in beat mania, dude, I'm stuck in the crib and I don't know what

659
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,260
to do.

660
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,260
Loki.

661
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,780
Didn't you know that guitar hero totally ripped off the mania definitely ripped off the guitar

662
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,780
hero.

663
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
Yeah, totally.

664
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
I mean, g four said it.

665
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
It must be true.

666
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
Everything anyways.

667
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,820
So yeah, they announced that game as well as some other games, which I'm sure no one

668
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,820
has ever heard of.

669
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,820
Uh, hold on, hold on.

670
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,700
AJ makes acts a really good question in chat.

671
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,340
Does anyone really want rock revolution?

672
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,340
What do you think?

673
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,340
I mean, is this something?

674
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,900
I guess the answer is if it's a good game, sure.

675
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Yeah.

676
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,500
But that's just like saying, I don't really want guitar hero for either or guitar hero

677
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
world tour.

678
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,580
Did you cover guitar hero yet?

679
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,580
No.

680
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,580
Okay.

681
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,580
Talk guitar hero.

682
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,300
Cause I got something I want to add to this guitar hero world tour, which I don't even

683
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,780
know why they're calling guitar hero anymore because now they've added drums.

684
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,780
They're supposed to be more realistic because now they have two symbols that are up top

685
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,820
and then they have three drum pads as well.

686
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
So you have five.

687
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,500
So you're immediately better than, you know, guitars or not guitar hero, rock band, because

688
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,020
now you have one additional drum pad and they also have a kick drum as well.

689
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,660
And apparently they're going to be, um, pressure sensitive.

690
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,620
So if you hit them harder, the sounds heart, you know, louder, yippy.

691
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:26,080
Um, and then the guitars changed again, but it's, you know, basically just another redesign.

692
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,780
It's still five buttons, um, all that fun stuff.

693
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:35,260
And uh, then they also have a sound creation or a song creation mode as well.

694
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,060
And they're promising, you know, all the same stuff that rock bands prompt, actually all

695
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,900
the same stuff that rock band is delivering with.

696
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,980
And then some, you know, I got to say a song creation mode could be interesting.

697
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,860
I'll tell you one game I checked out a demo for this week was jam sessions.

698
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,460
I did the little, uh, Nintendo channel download service and I play jam sessions.

699
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,460
That's actually kind of fun.

700
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,460
You know what?

701
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,500
No, it's really original about that song creation mode.

702
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,460
It's that guitar freaks did it like years ago.

703
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,940
God damn, but Konami missed the bus years ago.

704
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,460
Oh, but it's completely original.

705
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,220
You watch G4 and go, Oh, it's a completely original idea.

706
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
So cool.

707
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,700
Tiger claw sent a list of what songs are supposed to be in rock revolution.

708
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
And some of it sounds interesting.

709
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,020
I mean, it has come on field.

710
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
The noise by quiet.

711
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,020
Right?

712
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,020
That's kind of the thing about this.

713
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,020
Am I evil?

714
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,020
Metallica?

715
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,020
They're focusing on drums.

716
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,580
That's basically their focus is on the drum.

717
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
Okay, wait.

718
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
Dance dance revolution does get some major points right here.

719
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,740
We're not going to take it by twisted sister.

720
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,420
That is pretty awesome, but they're all covers.

721
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,300
That's less awesome anyways.

722
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,700
So songs are games that we have never heard of, uh, dance dance revolution X, of course,

723
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,860
they're celebrating their 10th anniversary.

724
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:47,640
It's going to be all, you know, reskinned it kind of, they've got some interesting songs

725
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,100
for it so far.

726
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,580
Um, but it's going to be, uh, 70 different tracks.

727
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,780
They're going to have a brand new LAN battle mode that's going to allow you to play up

728
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,900
against, uh, eight players over, uh, LAN.

729
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,860
So, you know, making it competitive, although I don't know why you would have eight people

730
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,660
having a LAN party for DDR.

731
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,980
Uh, you can create your own workout and fitness program through the workout mode.

732
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,220
Uh, they're going to have new characters and enhanced graphics and still going to use the

733
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,700
damn itoy.

734
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:21,020
Um, then they're also going to have DDR universe three, which is only on the three 60 right

735
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:28,340
now, also 70 songs with music from the seventies to today, uh, DJ mode and all this new surprises.

736
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
No one.

737
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,500
Uh, it's more DDR quest, low key, more DDR.

738
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Yeah.

739
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,980
It, they really haven't innovated there.

740
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,020
And then, um, hottest party too, which, you know, yeah, yeah.

741
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,780
So we're DDR on the week, but you can have your me's now dancing in hottest part too.

742
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:51,100
So yeah, but they showed off silent Hill silent Hills.

743
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Pretty cool.

744
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,660
Happy about that.

745
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,020
Uh, but that's basically it from, okay.

746
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,180
So music games, I want to say, wait real quick on music games.

747
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,540
Okay.

748
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,060
I don't have room in my house for all that shit.

749
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,540
Even if I could afford it, here's the deal.

750
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,460
If you, if one, if these companies want to win this little war on music games, seriously,

751
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,940
make a peripheral that works with all the games.

752
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,140
Xbox 360 will not have that problem because they, well, I'm not sure about the drums,

753
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,380
but with the guitars, they're made like one of the things Microsoft makes all the companies

754
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,940
play nice with each other.

755
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,500
So if it's got five buttons, it will work the same way.

756
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,100
I didn't buy rock band for a reason.

757
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Well, I did buy rock band.

758
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,180
I bought rock band as a standalone game with the guitar.

759
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,620
I did not buy the whole big box for a reason.

760
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,020
This is the reason this was coming.

761
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,340
We all knew it, but I don't really, here's the thing though.

762
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,340
I don't really care.

763
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,020
It's like even, I think rock bands kind of hurt themselves a little bit because now that

764
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,500
there's all this download content, and I don't know about a lot of people, but I've downloaded

765
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,300
a lot of it.

766
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,100
I don't really need another game with 40 songs in there.

767
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,900
Why do I need to buy another game?

768
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,420
Because they're really not going to innovate too much on it.

769
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,220
It's just going to have song updates.

770
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,060
But when you're getting, you know, three new tracks each week that you can download, by

771
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,380
the time you get to where another game would be released, you already have another game

772
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,980
built in.

773
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:19,780
And the other thing too, which I'm not sure about, you know, Guitar Hero 4 on tour world

774
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,260
or whatever the fuck they're calling it, World Tour.

775
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,460
What about all that download content that you had from 3?

776
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,140
I know Rock Band 2, one of the things that they were talking about is that you're going

777
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,720
to be able to use your old download content from Rock Band 1 with the new game.

778
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,540
Kind of like how, you know, DDR Ultra Mix used to do it.

779
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,260
Comments from chat, chat.orangelandradio.com.

780
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,540
Gerardimo says, wait, Miis and DDR, if you made Loki, me, in a green suit, would it be

781
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,300
like Loki dancing in a tingle suit?

782
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
No.

783
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,100
Probably the closest thing you're going to get to it.

784
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,460
Black Wolf is hugging his steel battalion controller.

785
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,980
I think making a reference to expensive peripherals.

786
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,300
But seriously, you're crazy if you own steel battalion.

787
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,460
You have to be a certain kind of crazy to own steel battalion.

788
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,580
Right Dark Sakura?

789
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,300
I have no room to talk.

790
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:15,060
But yeah, it's going to be really hard for these guys to sell, you know, because also

791
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,560
there's rumors going around now with what GameStop has listed on their website for Guitar

792
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,700
Hero World Tour, where it's going to cost like $179.

793
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,220
So essentially, you know, like 10 bucks more than Rock Band.

794
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,500
I mean, really, are you guys going to spend close to another $200 to buy, you know, I'm

795
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,460
assuming a lot of people out there bought Rock Band and probably bought all the peripherals

796
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
for it.

797
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,820
But you know, you did that because now you can use your guitar with Guitar Hero and stuff

798
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,820
like that.

799
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,280
But are you really going to buy more stuff to do Guitar Hero World Tour?

800
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,340
Don't get me wrong, Steel Battalion is a piece of gaming history.

801
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,860
I mean, it's the only controller ever that has an eject button and that makes it all

802
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,860
kinds of awesome.

803
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,700
But you seriously have to be all kinds of crazy.

804
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,420
It's just, I don't know, it's going to be really hard with all these games coming out

805
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
in the holiday.

806
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,900
I don't think some of them are going to do well.

807
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,300
I'm sure Guitar Hero will do well by itself.

808
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,340
Maybe people will just pick up World Tour and maybe do the drums later or something

809
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,220
because you can do that or you can buy.

810
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,220
I will buy the game.

811
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,220
I will not buy the guitar.

812
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,460
I will not buy the game if it's not compatible with the guitar I already have.

813
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,540
I am not buying a new guitar until that one is run, the one I have is run into the ground.

814
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
The end.

815
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,340
I don't understand why they, you know, redesign the guitar anyways each time.

816
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,860
It's just, all that does is delay the game.

817
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,940
So anyway, so enough of Konami's gamer days.

818
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,940
Alright, sorry.

819
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
That's the last week's news.

820
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,780
Anyways, so other stuff.

821
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,700
We've got Sony had their sort of gamer day.

822
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,940
So there's some stuff coming out of that.

823
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:47,260
I remember they've got, they were showing off some of their new games like, you know,

824
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,460
Killzone 2 and Resistance Fall Man 2 and that kind of stuff.

825
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,740
Resistance is supposed to be coming out this fall.

826
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,460
Killzone 2 has been delayed to February because they don't want to compete with themselves,

827
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,180
which, you know, makes sense.

828
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:05,060
And then Motor Storm is going to be coming out, of course, also in the fall as well.

829
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:12,740
Little Big Planet, October, and there is a new SOCOM game, Confrontation, I believe,

830
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,340
that's coming out to their PlayStation Network in September.

831
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,540
Also, Sega was showing off their stuff as well.

832
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,380
They announced a partnership with Platinum Games and they're going to be putting out

833
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,340
three games in the beginning of this.

834
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,940
One of the games, pretty awesome.

835
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,180
Did they announce plastic maracas for Samba?

836
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
No.

837
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,180
Don't care.

838
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,260
Well, that's not Platinum Games, okay.

839
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
But they're working on it.

840
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,060
They want to make those, okay.

841
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:48,380
So right now, the one game, Mad World, which is going to be an ultra-violent game for the

842
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,380
Wii.

843
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,380
It's all black and white except for the blood.

844
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,900
All right, I'm interested.

845
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,900
Extremely awesome.

846
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:59,020
There were, you know, they're killing people in all sorts of fun ways.

847
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,420
There's another game that's going to be coming out as well.

848
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,780
That is on the DS.

849
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,380
I'm trying to remember who was making that one.

850
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,380
Some other developer.

851
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,820
But it's a pretty cool like, I want to say like a shooter game.

852
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,160
What was it?

853
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,740
It was Infinite Line.

854
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,420
And I love the company's name for this, Nude Maker.

855
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,420
Nice.

856
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,860
But they, and to kind of tie back here, they are the creator of Steel Battalion and before

857
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,780
that, the Clock Tower series, and that's coming to the DS.

858
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:39,300
And then on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, they're getting a game called Bayonetta,

859
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:46,340
which is an action game starring this chick that has guns on her feet, like pistols.

860
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,380
Wasn't that the movie that Quentin Tarantino did recently?

861
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,660
It's not, she doesn't, she has legs, but there's like strapped to her boots are like pistols.

862
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,660
Okay.

863
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,660
Type thing.

864
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,660
All right.

865
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,660
It's cool looking.

866
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Okay.

867
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
And so that's going to be coming as well.

868
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:06,420
And I think not the, I think she's supposed to be like a witch or something, not to compare

869
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,140
it to bullet with sharing a thing, but.

870
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,620
So she's a witch with guns.

871
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,620
Witch with guns.

872
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,620
Amazing.

873
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,620
And.

874
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,620
Why didn't I think of that?

875
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,020
I don't know.

876
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,940
You're just not on the cutting edge of game development there.

877
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,180
This is why we have a podcast on the internet and I'm trying to think if there's anything

878
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,180
else.

879
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Reading comments from chat real quick.

880
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,740
DJ Morpheus says, then I'll get the rock band rehab expansion that comes when you create

881
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,380
your own eat true Hollywood story.

882
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,380
That would be fun.

883
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,700
Like a tar hero mixed with heroin hero.

884
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,820
Good times.

885
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,820
Let's see.

886
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,060
Gerardo says that there might be Morocco sleeves for somebody because that's one thing they're

887
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
talking about.

888
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,900
If not, there's always third party companies.

889
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,900
Someone will make it.

890
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,540
If you, the demands there.

891
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,900
One thing, they had, Microsoft did their little gamer day thing as well.

892
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,380
They showed off the new Banjo Kazooie game.

893
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,220
No motion controllers, unfortunately.

894
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,460
No word on what that lips peripheral was or anything like that.

895
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,700
I guess we're just going to have to wait.

896
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,900
And they showed off Gears of War 2, of course, a little bit more of that.

897
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,420
Looks pretty awesome.

898
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,540
And that of course will be coming out this fall.

899
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,580
Trying to think if there's anything else.

900
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,580
Cool.

901
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:20,940
We'll be getting into later on about Xbox Live Arcade and stuff like that.

902
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:28,160
And I also know that the XNA service has been launched, but just for the developers.

903
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,700
So people that have a membership to XNA can play the games.

904
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,340
All right.

905
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,700
So well, it sounds like because wasn't the community supposed to vote on the games and

906
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
stuff?

907
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,980
They're probably getting it ready for letting it run a few cycles so that they have some

908
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,740
games to go live when they go live.

909
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,740
Yeah.

910
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,740
All right.

911
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,860
Enough of last week's news.

912
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,540
We're almost 45 minutes into the show.

913
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,060
It's time to get into this week's news.

914
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,780
And speaking of Guitar Hero, we're going to start off with another Guitar Hero story because

915
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,260
I swear these music games have been all over the news lately.

916
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,900
It's crazy.

917
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,300
On the PlayStation 3 only, Guitar Hero is going to be getting a free song.

918
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,140
It makes sense because the Xbox 360 got a free Halo song.

919
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,940
So why not a free God of War song for PlayStation 3 owners?

920
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,020
And that's exactly what they're going to be getting on June 5th.

921
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,620
Except we don't know which song it is.

922
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:21,980
Just knows that it's a God of War song and it probably has a lot of heavy guitars seeing

923
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,660
as it's going to be in Guitar Hero.

924
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,660
So it'd be free.

925
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,700
So it's kind of like Sony's answer to, or I guess you could say, you know, the equivalent

926
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:33,300
of the Halo theme on the Xbox 360 Guitar Hero.

927
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
So check it out.

928
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
Do we have to?

929
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,300
No, you don't have to.

930
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
I mean, if you don't own a PS3, you kind of can't.

931
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,300
I'll check it out.

932
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,300
Then I won't.

933
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,700
I like free, but then again, Yaris was also free.

934
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
That's true.

935
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,540
But I don't, I don't see how you can go wrong with a free song.

936
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,260
Free songs are only going to, if a free song sucks, it's only going to terrorize you for

937
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,460
three minutes and then it's over.

938
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,820
Unless it's yodeling with, you know, Zither as the company.

939
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,820
Yodel Hero.

940
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,820
Where's that?

941
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,820
That's, that's what I want.

942
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:03,060
How about something that has absolutely nothing to do with music games?

943
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,060
Wind it up.

944
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,060
Nothing to do with music games.

945
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,060
All right.

946
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,060
Nothing to do with music games.

947
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,980
Except for one of these theme songs was used in Pop Up Music.

948
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,980
Okay.

949
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,420
One, actually two of my favorite companies ever are getting together to make a fighting

950
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,420
game.

951
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,540
I am very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very tense, infinity happy about

952
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,340
this.

953
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,580
We are getting Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

954
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,580
Yay.

955
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,580
So happy.

956
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,980
And for those that have no effing idea what Tatsunoko is.

957
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:38,460
Is this the animation studio that gave us such a wonderful series as of course my favorite

958
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:46,220
of all time, Science Ninja Team Gatchaman gave us Kashan, which are actually Ken and

959
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,220
Tetsuya are both confirmed characters for that.

960
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,700
They're on the test versions now along with Ryu and Chun-Li.

961
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,860
But they're also for, you know, other things that they gave us was Hurricane Polymer did

962
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,940
a lot of the animation for Evangelion.

963
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,940
It gave us, I don't know if anyone watched a lot of Nickelodeon in the, the mid to late

964
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:15,060
80s, but they gave us the little bits and quite a few other crazy, well, they actually

965
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:32,500
have the Gatchaman music in it, but also, and I apologize, I had to use a different

966
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,420
source in what you gave me, Rob, because I, that's all right.

967
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:43,980
What was also sort of hinted at as far as being included in the game is characters from

968
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:51,820
Timeboukan, Hurricane Polymer, Tekkaman, Hakusho and Daimo, the Genie family.

969
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:58,060
So and anyone else who doesn't know, MotGogoGo was Tatsunoko as well, which was Speed Racer

970
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,060
for us.

971
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,060
Was it Macross also?

972
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,060
Macross was as well.

973
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,060
Yes.

974
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:07,140
It's an honest question though, is this game really going to come out in America?

975
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,140
Like ever?

976
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,780
God, I hope so, and if not, I'll drive my ass down to Arcade Infinity and play the hell

977
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,780
out of it.

978
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,780
Oh, it's an arcade.

979
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,780
Yeah.

980
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,780
Hmm.

981
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,260
Oh, they're not, are they putting it out on home platforms at all, they said?

982
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,260
I haven't seen any mention on it.

983
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,500
Hopefully PlayStation 3, because then you can import that bitch.

984
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,500
That's a good point.

985
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,380
However, if anyone wants to see, there are some, okay, don't look for the Famitsu scans,

986
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,380
they're crap.

987
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,980
Um, go actually onto Famitsu's website and look up the images.

988
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:42,020
I mean, if you, if you do a search for Tatsunoko versus Capcom, you'll find a link to Famitsu's

989
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,500
page that's got all the stuff on it.

990
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,900
Just tons of pretty pictures.

991
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:53,060
And one of the levels that they're fighting on looks like it's a Mega Man Legends level.

992
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,060
Wait, what?

993
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,220
Thank God the Servbots are back.

994
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,820
Yeah, it has a giant Servbot in the background.

995
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,820
Hot.

996
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,260
So, um, maybe we'll be seeing, uh, Rockman.

997
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,700
Maybe we'll be seeing Tron Bon.

998
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,380
That would be cool.

999
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,540
Rama is pretty convinced it's not coming out here.

1000
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,300
He says in chat, uh, Tatsunoko versus Capcom will not happen in the U S due to massive

1001
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,300
licensing issues.

1002
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,420
It doesn't mean they won't import it over here.

1003
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,140
So never say never, but it'll be, you know, import heaven.

1004
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,980
Why do you think I said arcade infinity?

1005
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,620
Cause they, they, are they still around?

1006
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,620
Are they still?

1007
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,620
I'm sure they are.

1008
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,620
I'm sure they are too.

1009
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:33,340
I mean, what are, what arcades have been getting like the, the big imports for ages?

1010
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,340
True is arcade.

1011
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,300
They even had that weirdo Gundam game.

1012
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,300
I mean, hello.

1013
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
They had um, Jammer Lammy.

1014
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:43,460
I remember playing the game and I had to now don't get the dirty thoughts out of your mind.

1015
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,580
I had to play the game on my knees because it's made for little kids.

1016
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,580
So I had to like get on my knees to play the arcade game.

1017
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,660
Best game that was there was the pancake flipping game.

1018
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:56,700
No, no, no punch mania.

1019
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,900
The tambourine game was my favorite thing ever.

1020
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,900
That that was the gayest game I've ever played in my life.

1021
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,900
Yes.

1022
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,540
It was samba de amigo with tambourines and you actually had to shake the tambourine and

1023
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,780
make these little motions.

1024
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:12,740
It was the gayest thing I've ever done in my life.

1025
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,740
Are you sure?

1026
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,740
You gay?

1027
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,740
Yes.

1028
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:20,980
If you play a tambourine game, you gay.

1029
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:26,660
For real like I've marched in the San Francisco pride parade and the tambourine game was gayer.

1030
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,660
Alright.

1031
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,660
I marched behind like assless chaps across America.

1032
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,140
Better than wearing the orange hat.

1033
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,100
And the tambourine was gayer.

1034
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,540
Alright, moving on.

1035
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,140
Tambourine was gayer.

1036
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:45,460
Anyways, so Microsoft made an announcement and this kind of ruins all those rumors that

1037
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:52,660
we had earlier about motion sensing calibration coming to a spring update.

1038
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,820
Well there is no spring dashboard update this year.

1039
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:01,820
So so sad, no update, but you know there may be some other stuff coming later on that's

1040
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,500
not involved with a dashboard update.

1041
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
So.

1042
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Oh well.

1043
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,140
If it ain't broke, don't fix it I guess.

1044
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,180
If it ain't broke, break it more.

1045
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,180
I don't know.

1046
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,620
It's a little sad though that they're not doing an update.

1047
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,740
I kind of looked forward to those things and especially like we knew.

1048
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,100
I think some list leaked that week we were out of the supposed things that were going

1049
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,100
to be in it.

1050
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,100
They were supposed to have podcasts on the 360 now and all this stuff and I was thinking

1051
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,620
like this all sounds really cool even though I you know we all knew the list was bullshit.

1052
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:34,660
I mean it was still kind of sad when Microsoft says no none of it.

1053
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,660
None of it for you.

1054
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,740
Yeah it just better make the fall update that much cooler.

1055
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,740
Before I forget.

1056
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,740
Sorry to interrupt.

1057
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:50,200
I'm linking the Tatsunoko versus Capcom Famitsu page in the chat room.

1058
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,860
I was so three minutes ago.

1059
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,860
Sorry.

1060
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,860
I had to find it.

1061
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,860
I do that all the time.

1062
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,860
Timmy missed the bus.

1063
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,860
I wouldn't shut up about the missed the bus the whole time.

1064
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,860
I didn't miss the bus.

1065
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,860
I drive a fucking tank.

1066
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,860
Alright.

1067
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:07,500
I blew up the bus.

1068
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,700
Speaking of bus.

1069
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,540
I made a new friend last night is actually somebody who's listened to our show before.

1070
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,980
He's a friend of a mutual friend and we were talking about games we'd like to see on the

1071
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,980
Wii.

1072
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,780
We were talking about the Wii Wheel and he said I know what the Wii Wheel would be useful

1073
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,780
for.

1074
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,380
Desert bus on virtual console.

1075
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,000
You go to hell.

1076
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,860
You go to hell.

1077
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,580
And I was like that would make that Wii Wheel kind of useful.

1078
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:38,220
Yeah for you know an 18 hour drive in real time.

1079
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,640
It was a four hour drive in real time isn't it?

1080
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,540
It's Vegas L.A. isn't it?

1081
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,820
Alright it's.

1082
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,820
That is hotness.

1083
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,820
Jamie's making me look at screen time.

1084
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,820
Yes it's very sexy.

1085
00:50:50,820 --> 00:51:01,340
Alright let's move on to some more gaming news and something

1086
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,500
you might be able to play on the Xbox 360.

1087
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,220
RBI baseball.

1088
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,520
Remember RBI baseball?

1089
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,620
This game is old school like I think it was yeah it was put out by Tengen.

1090
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,620
They were like the rebel company you know they put out that original Tetris.

1091
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,820
So basically it was, wasn't it a spin off of Atari like an Atari.

1092
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,820
Yes it was.

1093
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,820
Yeah.

1094
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,820
So here's the thing.

1095
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,820
Poor Atari.

1096
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:31,200
Apparently the ESRB is listed RBI baseball but the developers is six degree games.

1097
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,020
So I don't know if it's going to be the same RBI baseball.

1098
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,020
Probably not.

1099
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,020
It better be.

1100
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,720
That would be kind of rad if it was because that's that I don't play a lot of sports games

1101
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,240
but I remember RBI baseball.

1102
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,140
They really should like change their name to the six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

1103
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,740
So regardless the ESRB listed it so you know it's coming soon RBI baseball to Xbox Live

1104
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,860
Arcade.

1105
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,060
Well we have some other news regarding Xbox Live Arcade.

1106
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,820
Anything that's crap goes.

1107
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:10,340
Microsoft is going to be delisting older Xbox Live Arcade titles that sold small numbers

1108
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,060
and have a low Metacritic average.

1109
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,060
Yaris?

1110
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,060
Please be Yaris.

1111
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,460
It was free so a ton of people downloaded it.

1112
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,460
It's attached rates.

1113
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,540
Yaris will be immune.

1114
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,300
People that bought the full version and unfortunately since it was a free download that counts as

1115
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,300
the full version.

1116
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,300
Fuck.

1117
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,100
There's a quote by Mark Whitten who's Xbox Live's general manager saying we will be delisting

1118
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:36,540
older underperforming titles in order to keep the service focused on a section of high quality

1119
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,540
games.

1120
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,060
To translate that means they're shit get them off the server.

1121
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:46,420
No to translate that means our marketplace is insufficient to handle this many games

1122
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:51,780
so we have to find a way to reduce it because I think that's seriously what it is is that

1123
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:57,500
there's too many games in the marketplace because Xbox doesn't present it in a very

1124
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,780
user friendly way.

1125
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:05,380
Well the rest of the quote goes on to say the way this will work is that the title will

1126
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,980
need to be at least six months old and have a Metacritic score below 65 and a conversion

1127
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,620
rate below 6% on the service.

1128
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,980
Which means fewer than 6% of the people will have downloaded the demo and actually pay

1129
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,980
for it.

1130
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:23,860
They say they're also giving a three month notice before delisting anything.

1131
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,460
That's kind of interesting though that the critics will have kind of a say.

1132
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,020
That's kind of scary in a way.

1133
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:33,060
I mean I realize it's got to be both criteria but that's still kind of strange to me.

1134
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,060
Yeah.

1135
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,060
I don't know.

1136
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,060
Let's see.

1137
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,500
Here's some games that per Metacritic would be eligible for delisting.

1138
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,380
Now granted we don't know how well it sold through.

1139
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,300
Discs of Tron has a 44.

1140
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,140
I have to go download that now.

1141
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,500
I got to tell you what though it really isn't.

1142
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,020
It was better in your childhood Jamie.

1143
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,020
It really was.

1144
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,460
Is it at least six months old?

1145
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,740
It's getting there.

1146
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,380
So it's not eligible yet.

1147
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,340
Let's see what else is under 65 here Metacritic.

1148
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,100
Mr. Driller online is a 48 right now.

1149
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,860
So Mr. Driller online would be eligible for the plug pull in.

1150
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:09,860
Let's see.

1151
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:14,940
Rocky and Bullinkle 37 on Metacritic but that game, that game was shit.

1152
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,860
That game was pretty shit.

1153
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,860
Tikal.

1154
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,860
Tikal.

1155
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,860
Tikal.

1156
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,860
58.

1157
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,860
Quick.

1158
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,460
Can you name what Tikal, can you name what that game is?

1159
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,020
It's a puzzle game.

1160
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,020
Okay.

1161
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,020
Good.

1162
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,020
You're right.

1163
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,020
It's a puzzle game.

1164
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,020
So that's what we got.

1165
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,020
Let's see.

1166
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,340
That gives you an idea of the type of games that could be there.

1167
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:39,460
Yaris I believe was 17, had a score of 17 on Metacritic last time I looked.

1168
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,460
Bye bye Yaris.

1169
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,460
It was pretty terrible.

1170
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,460
Euthanizing.

1171
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,460
But it's got the sell through.

1172
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,460
I don't know.

1173
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,460
Now here's the thing.

1174
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:50,020
Tiger call also said the other exact thing I was thinking before is that this, Sky this

1175
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:55,180
is also bad because people that bought those games won't be able to redownload them if

1176
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,980
they ever delete them from the hard drive.

1177
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:00,820
But Black Wolf says that question was asked directly and they said yes, you can still

1178
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:04,460
redownload them using the account management interface.

1179
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:08,820
And Black Wolf says they just won't have shelf space anymore, which is kind of a good comparison

1180
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,380
to make is that it's like pulling these games off of shelves and putting them in the bargain

1181
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,380
bin.

1182
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,380
They're not selling.

1183
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,180
I think these games should go in the bargain bin, honestly.

1184
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,220
But Yaris was already free.

1185
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,460
So they have to pay people to download Yaris.

1186
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,660
Which they should be.

1187
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,820
There's no amount of money worth downloading Yaris.

1188
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,420
So it's going to be interesting.

1189
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,900
I'm kind of curious to see the effect.

1190
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,020
I mean, I agree to some extent they need to clean up Xbox Live.

1191
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,180
But I don't know if I agree with getting rid of games completely.

1192
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,820
Sweeping them under the rug and making them harder to find.

1193
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,820
Sure.

1194
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,900
Spotlighting the games that need to be have the spotlight on them because these other

1195
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,580
you know crappy retro ports are out doing them.

1196
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:51,540
You know, Rob, if they're going to clean up Xbox Live, they should probably start with

1197
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,420
the users.

1198
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:57,100
Well, they have been doing that to some extent recently.

1199
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,500
We'll get to more on that a little later.

1200
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,500
But for now, let's get back to some more gaming news.

1201
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,540
So Xbox, one of the things, and this kind of goes back to people having to redownload

1202
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,340
games and stuff.

1203
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:15,940
If you've ever had your Xbox 360 crap out on you and, you know, got a replacement, you

1204
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,160
may find that some of your games don't work anymore unless you're logged in online.

1205
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,900
Well now, Microsoft is going to release a tool tied in with Xbox.com that will allow

1206
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:31,500
you to fix the digital rights management so that your games are locked to your new console

1207
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:36,780
so there will be no more problems with your games not working offline.

1208
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,900
About fucking time.

1209
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,900
About damn time.

1210
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,360
That also applies to if you bought an elite system and transferred your stuff using that

1211
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,780
hard drive transfer cable.

1212
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,980
That will also screw it up.

1213
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,460
So that's nice to see that they're finally fixing it.

1214
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,060
Yeah, seems to be a little late, but yeah, I have a couple games, because I got the Red

1215
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,060
Ring of Death.

1216
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:01,020
Now granted, I got Red Ring of Death three days after I bought my Xbox 360, so I only

1217
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,700
have two games that do this, but Geometry Wars and Joust were like the first two games

1218
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,620
I bought on Xbox Live Arcade.

1219
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:11,060
And whenever I try to play them, if I'm not connected to Xbox Live, they won't work.

1220
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,660
So in Geometry Wars, that's a pretty big deal.

1221
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:16,740
Like, and you'll know, I even noticed like a little bit of lag when I go into the game,

1222
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,140
like it's talking to Xbox Live and then realizes I have the retail version and then suddenly

1223
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,420
my menu changes to the retail menu.

1224
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,860
It all happens within seconds.

1225
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,460
So it'll be kind of nice to take those games back.

1226
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,420
I know other people have had way worse scenarios where it was more than two games and multiple

1227
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,420
users in the house.

1228
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,860
My console has way more than two games.

1229
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,860
Yeah.

1230
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:40,420
So, that'll be kind of nice to reset the digital rights management, so we'll see how that works

1231
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,380
when that comes out.

1232
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:46,140
I will definitely be running it to get those, to take back control of those two games, but

1233
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,140
we'll see.

1234
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:52,340
Well, you're talking a little bit about rediscovering things that were a little bit old and if you've

1235
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:56,980
never played Gears of War, it's probably time to come out from under your rock and now's

1236
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,240
a good time though because what's going to be happening is that Gears of War is coming

1237
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:05,620
out with a brand new like re-release, a game of the year edition, if you will.

1238
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,100
It's coming out this summer.

1239
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:12,380
It's Gears of War with all the download content included that originally people had to pay

1240
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,220
for and it's only going to be 40 bucks.

1241
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,900
So, that's kind of cool.

1242
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,620
I won't be impressed because I like the Windows version.

1243
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,300
So, June 24th is apparently the day this is coming out.

1244
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,100
Hey, just in time for my birthday and the sixth birthday of Orange Launch Radio as well

1245
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,260
on the 23rd of June.

1246
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,260
That's hardcore.

1247
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,260
Yes.

1248
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,300
So, if you haven't played Gears of War, you can check that out, but I think honestly most

1249
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,880
people that would enjoy Gears of War have probably already played it, so this does seem

1250
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,900
a little bit late, but there's a lot of people that are just now getting Xbox 360s too, you

1251
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:49,580
know, as the price comes down and more people get HDTVs and want to spend their stimulus

1252
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:52,540
checks and yada, yada, yada.

1253
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,500
They'll be an audience for this and won't be a huge audience, but they'll be an audience

1254
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,700
for this.

1255
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:02,500
Well, one thing though that I think is going to work out better for everybody who has an

1256
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:08,540
Xbox and it's about damn time and I think that we all saw it happening is that Xbox

1257
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:17,340
Live Arcade is going to be changing their limit from 150MB to 350MB and it's been made

1258
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:24,660
official especially since we've got Soul Calibur coming out.

1259
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:28,940
They're really trying to get me to upgrade to that 100GB hard drive already because I

1260
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,260
only have a 20GB drive still that I've just been making work.

1261
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,980
I had to finally uninstall Final Fantasy XI to get the room.

1262
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,740
Well, the price limit of Xbox Live Arcade games has actually also been raised to 1600

1263
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:42,740
points, which is about 20 bucks.

1264
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,700
Developers, you better make darn sure your game is worth it.

1265
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:50,140
I mean, the Penny Arcade game, they'll get it for that and it's, you know, it's pretty

1266
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,140
cool.

1267
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,620
Again, I don't have a chance, I haven't had a chance to give it a full review yet, so

1268
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:57,180
I can't say for sure if it's worth the 20 bucks, but it seems like it will be.

1269
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,300
We shall see.

1270
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,180
Interesting though that they're, why do they even have the limits in the first place?

1271
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,140
I guess they don't want people to go crazy, but I think, you know, when you, oh yeah,

1272
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,140
the original Xbox games are like one or two gigs.

1273
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:15,060
Well, originally they wanted to make sure that people that did not buy hard drives were

1274
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,780
able to put at least one game on their memory unit.

1275
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,780
You know.

1276
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,100
Well, now the memory units are 512, so now they can do three hits.

1277
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,540
I don't know, it's stupid, but yeah.

1278
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,540
Or they could just do 512.

1279
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,740
Or, I don't know, you buy a hard drive like everybody fucking else, okay?

1280
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,740
Seriously.

1281
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:29,740
Exactly.

1282
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:35,580
So, this is not a big surprise, I mean, the game that did so well, eventually of course

1283
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:42,300
it would be coming to the PlayStation 3, but Bioshock is officially coming to the PS3.

1284
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:47,620
It has been rumored to be coming for a while now, and it will be due out this holiday,

1285
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:54,940
and apparently the port, they claim, is gonna have slightly better graphics, some additional

1286
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,340
game content.

1287
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:02,580
We'll have to see, I guess, when it comes out.

1288
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:05,900
But everyone should get an opportunity to play Bioshock.

1289
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:06,960
Absolutely.

1290
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,460
One of these days we'll have to check out Bioshock.

1291
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:15,300
Are they gonna do that much more special on the PlayStation 3?

1292
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,300
Probably not.

1293
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,400
It'd probably be all the stuff that was download content before, maybe add another difficulty

1294
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,980
or something like that, who knows?

1295
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,980
Alright.

1296
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,140
Let's travel around the world and discover some release dates.

1297
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,020
Loki, why don't you start us off with what's coming out in the U.S.?

1298
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:33,500
Well, this week there's not a whole lot coming out, pretty much, you know, the big title

1299
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:40,180
is gonna be Enemy Territory Quake Wars on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1300
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:44,260
Also on the Wii this week we've got Death Junior.

1301
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:48,260
I don't know, I don't know if I get too excited about the Death Junior game, but yes, brand

1302
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:52,540
new Death Junior, well actually I wouldn't say it's brand new, it's a remake coming to

1303
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,540
the Wii.

1304
01:01:53,540 --> 01:02:00,540
There's also Emergency Heroes, which is just like Emergency Mayhem, both sort of like Crazy

1305
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:06,540
Taxi and, I don't know, that's gonna be coming out to the Wii.

1306
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:15,380
And then this week is, I believe, Super Dodgeball Brawlers, which was a, I don't know if you

1307
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:20,420
guys remember the original Dodgeball game on the NES, it's kinda like a sequel to that,

1308
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,900
so that was kind of interesting.

1309
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:29,260
Let's see, also this week, Lost Planet Extreme Condition Colonies Edition, the Game of the

1310
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:34,460
Year kind of version of it for 30 bucks, with some little additional content in there, they

1311
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:39,220
have like a first version shooter mode and some other crap, so that's kinda neat.

1312
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:44,740
And The Monkey King, The Legend Begins, coming out on the Wii, it's another budget game,

1313
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:50,940
but it's a side-scroller shooter, it's all 2D hand-drawn, so that's kinda neat.

1314
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:56,100
The Metallic Rose DS Lite, coming out this week, also...

1315
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,900
I saw a commercial on TV for the Metallic, I don't, well I think she was playing a Metallic

1316
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:04,780
Rose or a pink DS, but it had Carrie Underwood playing Nintendogs on the DS.

1317
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,780
I don't even remember what show I was watching that shot on.

1318
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,780
Did her dogs run away from her?

1319
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,780
Does that be funny?

1320
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:11,100
No, they did, she was giving them a bath and giggling, although I bet it wasn't even her

1321
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,100
playing the game.

1322
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,380
They just had her posing with an empty DS.

1323
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,940
I'm trying to remember what the hell I was watching, they actually showed that, but I

1324
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:18,940
just thought that was interesting.

1325
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:22,620
Because I remember there was that commercial in the UK with Nicole Kidman, but they have

1326
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:25,860
one here now with Carrie Underwood, and I just thought it was interesting.

1327
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,860
Also this week, Mass Effect...

1328
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,460
I must have been watching some girly TV show.

1329
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,620
Actually, I think it was during Ellen.

1330
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:35,300
I think I was watching Ellen when I was home sick one day and I saw that, because Ellen's

1331
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,380
kind of a girly show, right?

1332
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,380
Yeah.

1333
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:44,100
Also, on the PC, Mass Effect is finally coming out, so you can play that as well.

1334
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,500
Dracula Origin on PC.

1335
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:54,000
If you want to shop at GameStop, there's the USA Today Crosswords Challenge, which is a

1336
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,340
GameStop exclusive.

1337
01:03:55,340 --> 01:04:01,260
Woo wee, that's one hell of an exclusive that's put out by Destineer, who makes only good

1338
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,260
games, I'm sure.

1339
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:04,660
Oh wait, no they don't.

1340
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:10,620
And then... and then that's pretty much... oh, World Championship Cards.

1341
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:16,940
That's right, it's card games that aren't poker or blackjack.

1342
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,940
Like Solitaire.

1343
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:18,940
Awesome.

1344
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:27,460
Oh, and there's a game called Bus Driver for the PC by Gostgame Entertainment.

1345
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:31,280
As long as Bus Driver has an awesome theme song, that'd be cool.

1346
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,020
I think we all know the theme song already.

1347
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,300
Rama's accusing me of watching Lifetime again.

1348
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:39,500
No, there haven't been any Lifetime movies recently that I've been interested in watching.

1349
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:44,260
Although I think there's a new one coming out that has... well, forget it.

1350
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,260
I love Lifetime movies.

1351
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:49,380
Aren't Lifetime movies the best?

1352
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:52,300
I'm like, they're so horrible that they're good.

1353
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,300
It's like a secret shame, you know?

1354
01:04:54,300 --> 01:05:00,900
You don't want people to know you watch that stuff, but then you're sick, or you are feeling

1355
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:05,980
like in a bad mood, and then you put it on Lifetime, and you're like, my life is so much

1356
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:06,980
better than this.

1357
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,020
I think that was actually the name of a Lifetime movie.

1358
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,020
A Secret Shame.

1359
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,200
And it makes me so embarrassed to be a man.

1360
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,660
The Dark Sakura Story.

1361
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,900
Rob.

1362
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,420
What?

1363
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,940
I have no secret shame.

1364
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:27,660
My shame is very public because I go to it once a week.

1365
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:31,740
A certain little garage studio.

1366
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,740
Very very public shame.

1367
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,740
Rob.

1368
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:35,740
What?

1369
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:42,740
They totally should make a Lifetime movie of the week about Jamie's life.

1370
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,300
Who would play Jamie?

1371
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,740
That's the question of the day.

1372
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,340
We need an instant poll in chat.

1373
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,860
Who would play Jamie in her Lifetime movie of the week?

1374
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,220
Someone who's sufficiently bitchy.

1375
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:58,140
Because I'd say Ella is a douche coup because I don't want to look like myself.

1376
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,140
Well I don't know.

1377
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,140
Christina Ricci.

1378
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,140
No.

1379
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:04,340
She's not really a celebrity, but she's a TV celebrity I guess.

1380
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:08,580
But that one chick, Mary Alice from Ace of Cakes.

1381
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:09,580
That would work.

1382
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,580
I don't watch TV.

1383
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,580
Janine Garofalo about ten years ago.

1384
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,580
Yes!

1385
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:14,580
I like her.

1386
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,980
I would approve of her.

1387
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,340
She's sufficiently bitchy.

1388
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,100
Jamie Summers as herself says act deaf.

1389
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,100
Margaret Cho says don't tattoo ya.

1390
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,140
Hi, I'm not Korean.

1391
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,860
I look nothing like Margaret Cho.

1392
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,900
Margaret Cho is gorgeous, but no.

1393
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,740
Rama says my best friend Patty.

1394
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,140
Tina Fey as Jamie.

1395
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,980
Oh, that's a good one.

1396
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,020
Tina Fey is the gal that she was in Mean Girls.

1397
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,780
She was the teacher with the glasses and everything.

1398
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,780
I have to look this up now.

1399
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,140
Look her up.

1400
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,140
That's a good one.

1401
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,140
That's my favorite so far.

1402
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,300
Ew, Rachael Ray.

1403
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,300
That's wrong.

1404
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,300
Instant ban.

1405
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,300
No, I'm just kidding.

1406
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,300
Alright.

1407
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,940
I have a friend who has a picture of her with genius on it.

1408
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:57,940
Tina Fey is cute.

1409
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,940
I like her.

1410
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,940
Alright.

1411
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:04,620
Anyhow, release dates over in Japan.

1412
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:10,500
Coming on the Xbox 360, Battle Fantasia comes out as well as Lost Planet Colonies and Overlord

1413
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,660
all coming out on May the 29th in Japan.

1414
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,380
Coming out on the Playstation 3, another port of Battle Fantasia.

1415
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,900
I'm not exactly sure what Battle Fantasia is.

1416
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,900
I've not heard of this.

1417
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,900
Battle Fantasia just sounds awesome.

1418
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,100
It's like a fighting game.

1419
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,100
Is it really?

1420
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,100
It's pretty cool looking.

1421
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,100
Oh yeah.

1422
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,100
It definitely looks like a little fighting game.

1423
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:30,260
There's a character called Marco who's like a little knight and Urs.

1424
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,260
The art style.

1425
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:36,460
If you have a Japanese account, they have a Japanese demo for it which I have not played

1426
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,460
yet.

1427
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:38,460
Is this by Namco?

1428
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,580
Because the art style reminds me of Eternal Sonata like a lot.

1429
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,740
No, it's by Arc System Works.

1430
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,740
Huh.

1431
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,740
Go figure.

1432
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,740
Be familiar with the guy.

1433
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,740
Oh, they did Guilty Gear.

1434
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,580
Guilty Gear and Fist of the North Star.

1435
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:49,780
Alright, so there you have it.

1436
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:54,340
Cygames coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

1437
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:59,100
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii Biohazard 4 Wii Edition.

1438
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,500
You might know that as Resident Evil.

1439
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,420
They call it Biohazard Overseas.

1440
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,220
Family Trainer Athletic World with Matt.

1441
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,880
Please note that is not Wii Fit but a cheap knockoff.

1442
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,660
On the Playstation 2, hey, remember Beatmania 2DX?

1443
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,660
Remember that game?

1444
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,660
Uh, what?

1445
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,660
Remember that game?

1446
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:23,540
14th Edition Beatmania 2DX 14 Gold finally hits the Playstation 2 on May the 29th.

1447
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,540
As well as...

1448
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,540
I should get that.

1449
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,540
I kind of want it too.

1450
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,540
Just for old times sake.

1451
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:30,340
I actually want Happy Sky just because it says Happy Sky.

1452
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,340
Burnout Revenge.

1453
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,780
I totally think I'm just going to buy all the Beatmania games I can that I'm missing.

1454
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,840
Because I seriously stopped at 9th style.

1455
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,940
So I'm missing a lot.

1456
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,820
The last I bought was 8th.

1457
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:40,820
Yeah.

1458
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:41,820
I loved Red though.

1459
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:42,980
Anyway, forget it.

1460
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:49,100
Burnout Revenge, Def Jam Vendetta, because Japan needed their Def Jam Vendetta.

1461
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:54,020
Fatal Fury Battle Archives is coming out on the Playstation 2 on May 29th.

1462
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:57,380
Fushugi Yugi gets some new games coming out.

1463
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,380
That series.

1464
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,380
Yeah.

1465
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,380
Let it die please.

1466
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,380
Suzaku Ibun.

1467
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,380
No, no, no.

1468
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,380
She's still writing books.

1469
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,140
Medal of Honor.

1470
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,180
Lots and lots of stuff coming out on the...

1471
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:12,860
By the way, there is a Konami style special edition for Beatmania 2DX 14 Gold.

1472
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,580
It probably comes with stickers and a bunch of useless crap.

1473
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:17,060
Beatmania 14 Gold poster.

1474
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:21,940
Oh, Beat Nation LEDs album and puzzle pieces.

1475
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:25,780
And Beatmania 2DX premium live DVD, the Beat Nation Summit.

1476
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:26,780
That'd be cool.

1477
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:29,300
That'd be kind of cool.

1478
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,460
I don't know.

1479
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,780
I don't have the love for Beatmania that I used to have.

1480
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:37,140
I think I got really disappointed that they gave up on it in the US.

1481
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,500
I was really disappointed they gave up on it here.

1482
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,500
They could have done a lot better.

1483
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,900
Well, their biggest advocate left the company.

1484
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,740
I guess that's true too.

1485
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:51,860
On the Nintendo DS, 13SaiNo, Hello Work DS, Front Mission 2089, Border of Madness.

1486
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:52,860
Another Sudoku game.

1487
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:53,860
Front Mission's awesome.

1488
01:09:53,860 --> 01:10:00,420
Zombie Shiki, Yogo Ryoku Soushi Jutsu, English of the Dead.

1489
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,420
Oh.

1490
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,420
Good times.

1491
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,420
That sounds like...

1492
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,420
On the Nintendo DS.

1493
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,660
I know it sounds like another game I'm thinking of.

1494
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:12,100
On the Sony PSP, I always thought this was a pretty bitchin' band that Enya used to be

1495
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:16,860
in, but Clannad, it comes out on the Sony PSP.

1496
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,260
It was Enya's sister.

1497
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,260
Was it Enya's sister?

1498
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,260
Yeah.

1499
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,260
Clannad.

1500
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,260
Let's see.

1501
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,260
What is this about?

1502
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:25,260
Oh, God.

1503
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,460
It's from this company that makes dating sim games.

1504
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:33,300
Clannad has gone from Enya's sister to dating sims.

1505
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:38,020
Memories Off and Valhalla Nights 2, all those are your Japanese release days.

1506
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:41,100
After a pretty slow month in Japan, that's good that you guys are getting a lot of stuff

1507
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,540
this week, so congrats.

1508
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,100
Japan is a winner this week.

1509
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:51,420
Honestly, I'd have to say that for the UK releases, the winning week had to have been

1510
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:56,060
last week, so I do want to go ahead and mention a few things that are already out that people

1511
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:00,700
should be getting or should have, and if they don't have Silent Hill Origins already, I'm

1512
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,700
going to cry.

1513
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:06,340
Dr. Mario and Germ Buster is out on Wii, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, My Life as a King,

1514
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:12,060
Lost Ones, Star Soldier R, those are all really good, and the Penny Arcade game, too, is actually

1515
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,060
on the 21st.

1516
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:18,860
Now, what we have coming out for this next release period... Oh, and by the way, they

1517
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:19,860
got Rock Band.

1518
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:24,220
All the good stuff's already out, so I don't see what the point is.

1519
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,220
Yeah.

1520
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:26,220
It was kind of an issue in the UK.

1521
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:29,420
They got a really big delay on Rock Band, so it's just now making its way.

1522
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:37,380
Well, coming out on the 30th, we have Death Junior, Root of Evil, Dream Pinball, Enemy

1523
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:44,220
Territory Quake Wars, Monster Madness Grave Digger, Pool Party, Race Driver Grind, Supreme

1524
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:51,940
Commander, Codename Panzers Cold War, and Jamster All-Stars.

1525
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,340
Hopefully that's not the Jamster of the cell phone commercial kind.

1526
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,420
Crazy frog, probably.

1527
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,940
I'm going to look.

1528
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,940
I have more of a curiosity.

1529
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:04,500
Because if so, this game needs to be shot in the face.

1530
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,700
If it is that same Jamster, shoot it in the face.

1531
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,220
It needs to die in a fire.

1532
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,220
Yes.

1533
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:10,940
There are no... Well, Jamster's a company.

1534
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:17,780
It's Crazy Frog, and they have plenty of Crazy Frog games in the Europe interface area.

1535
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:18,780
Nothing yet.

1536
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,780
That's it.

1537
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:20,780
All right.

1538
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:21,780
Let's get back into some gaming... It's over.

1539
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:22,780
Let's get back to some gaming news.

1540
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:26,540
Metal Gear Solid 4, I made a joke earlier about the long cut scenes, but it's really not a

1541
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,620
joke.

1542
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:33,180
Some of the cut scenes in Metal Gear Solid 4 are apparently up to 90 minutes long.

1543
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,020
The good news is you can pause them.

1544
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,020
Phew.

1545
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,020
And that might be an exaggeration.

1546
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,020
Yeah.

1547
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:42,440
Also, the news came out this week that that might be a slight exaggeration that it's not

1548
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,960
really 90 minute cut scenes, but I would bet it's probably like Lost... Because Lost Odyssey

1549
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,660
had some fucking long cut scenes in it, but they were broken up like a little bit.

1550
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,740
Like little bits here and there it was broken up.

1551
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:56,260
So it's probably the same type of deal in Metal Gear Solid 4.

1552
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:59,620
Where you play for a little bit.

1553
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:06,740
Well, some other Metal Gear Solid 4 news is that Kojima is going to be in London signing

1554
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,140
Sleeves.

1555
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:17,320
So the release date is actually the 12th of June, and he is going to be around signing

1556
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:22,580
... Let me see if it's going to be where he is at HMV's Oxford Street London store on

1557
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:25,260
the 2nd of June to sign the copies.

1558
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:33,260
So it's also not just Kojima, but Yohji Shinkawa is going to be there too.

1559
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:38,780
And there's 300 sleeves available from the store on the day of the event, and it starts

1560
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,300
at 9 o'clock AM.

1561
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:49,060
So I will personally give whatever listener who gets me one a shout out and my undying

1562
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:57,460
affection, and I'll send you clippings from the ferret.

1563
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:58,920
Just so you know, they are just like sleeves.

1564
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,820
It's not actually the game that he's signing since, you know.

1565
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:03,820
That's why I said sleeves.

1566
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,220
Wait, you're going to shave the ferret?

1567
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:08,300
I said clippings.

1568
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,060
Like maybe part of it's butt hair.

1569
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:12,060
Shave the ferret.

1570
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,060
That sounds like a mini game in WarioWare.

1571
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,060
Shave!

1572
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:18,060
That sounds dirty, Rob.

1573
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,460
You're going to shave the ferret.

1574
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:27,540
Earlier, Jamie and I were talking about OLR, the RPG, and you know how like Final Fantasy

1575
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:30,220
has like the Tetra Master card games?

1576
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:34,820
Instead of the card game, you could have shave the ferret, the mini game inside of the OLR

1577
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:35,820
RPG.

1578
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:39,020
Or that could be like the first quest, because you know the first quest is always something

1579
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,260
pointless to introduce you to the game's mechanics.

1580
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:46,700
I think the first quest should be like having to take the ferret out for a shave.

1581
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:52,060
I was actually wanting to make a contest about whoever wanted to take like RPG Maker or something

1582
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:56,140
and actually make an OLR RPG, like a full-fledged RPG.

1583
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,020
I'd be right to try.

1584
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,020
That would take a long time.

1585
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,020
Yeah.

1586
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,020
Exactly.

1587
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,020
It would take a long time.

1588
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:06,460
Well, personally I was going to talk about, well they should have, you know that game

1589
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:09,660
coming out, Blastworks, the entire game is totally customizable.

1590
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:13,100
We can make our own levels and stuff like that, plus they have a website that you can

1591
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,780
upload it all to and you can download it, so.

1592
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:21,500
There's a little bit more though about this, about getting the sleeves, they're not just

1593
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:22,940
giving them out.

1594
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:28,500
You will get a sleeve if you pre-order the game at HMV and the deposits for the game

1595
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:32,300
is five pounds.

1596
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,300
Five pounds?

1597
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,300
Five quid.

1598
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,300
All right.

1599
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,300
Good lord, that's a lot of pounds.

1600
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,500
All right.

1601
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,500
Let's see.

1602
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,340
Well, I don't know if I can be too excited about this because it is a sports game, but

1603
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:51,260
Madden is going to be getting a bundle, a brand new PSP coming August 12th.

1604
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:55,740
It's going to be a metallic blue PSP that's exclusive to the bundle.

1605
01:15:55,740 --> 01:16:05,260
With it for $200, you will be getting Madden 09, an NFL In Just One Play UMD, a voucher

1606
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:12,380
to download the game Beats off the PlayStation Store, and a one gigabyte memory stick.

1607
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,100
From the knowledge you play too many sports games.

1608
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:19,220
I think it's kind of funny though that they include Beats on there, but you know, hey,

1609
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,000
more power to them, I guess.

1610
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,220
But that is coming August 12th, so yet another PSP bundle.

1611
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:31,940
You know, our old friend of the show, Shane, is going to get this bundle simply because

1612
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:32,940
the PSP is blue.

1613
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:33,940
It's kind of sad.

1614
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:39,620
Is he going to put High School Musical stickers all over it?

1615
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,620
Probably.

1616
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,580
Resident Evil 5, this game looks hot.

1617
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,420
I don't know if you've seen the screenshots.

1618
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,580
This game looks awesome.

1619
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,980
It's got that whole over the shoulder thing from Resident Evil 4, but it's now on next

1620
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:54,380
gen systems, and a hot game even gets hotter.

1621
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:58,900
Apparently Resident Evil 5 is going to be featuring cooperative play mode, and that

1622
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,820
means you can play co-op throughout the campaign.

1623
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:05,860
There's going to be also cover system mechanics in the game, so you can actually lock to a

1624
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:08,700
wall and then fire around corners.

1625
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:12,220
If you're not actually playing in co-op mode, the other character in the game will be controlled

1626
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,780
by the AI.

1627
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:14,780
That's kind of interesting.

1628
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:18,180
There's also going to be dodging that is done by the right analog stick, and apparently

1629
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:20,800
the game is in these more open areas.

1630
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,740
So this game sounds pretty awesome.

1631
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:26,580
All this information, by the way, comes from an article that was on GamesRadar, but got

1632
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,580
pulled.

1633
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:30,180
Hmm, and you know what it means when articles get pulled.

1634
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,300
They were true the whole time.

1635
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,360
Trust us.

1636
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,860
People die?

1637
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:37,960
No, that too.

1638
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,100
People don't die, they just get threatened and bullied a lot.

1639
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:44,700
Again, trust us, we know.

1640
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:45,700
I wouldn't know anything about it.

1641
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:49,260
They get taken out in the back alley and beat up a little bit.

1642
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,140
Well there's something else that should make some people happy too.

1643
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:59,340
So if you get threatening letters from Capcom, you can go hide in another series, which is

1644
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,340
Oddworld.

1645
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:04,580
I know that there are fans of this series, I have not played them, but I know a lot of

1646
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:11,100
people who love the Oddworld games.

1647
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:16,180
And so the co-founder of Maxis, Jeff Braun, said that he's working on another Oddworld

1648
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:17,180
game.

1649
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:23,020
It will feature new animation- Sorry, I got really mad, I decided to shoot

1650
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,020
Loki.

1651
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,020
Oh, okay.

1652
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,020
Ow.

1653
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,580
His foot hurts again.

1654
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,380
I was loading something in advance, because I tried to work in advance.

1655
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:32,380
Yeah, your gun!

1656
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:37,260
Yes, I was loading my gun.

1657
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,260
Can I finish reading now?

1658
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,260
Christ.

1659
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:40,260
All right, yes you can.

1660
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:41,260
Sorry.

1661
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,700
I didn't mean for that to happen.

1662
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:44,700
Yeah, right.

1663
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:48,400
Anyway, they're saying that basically the visuals are going to be about the same as

1664
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,900
what you'd expect in a good CGI feature film.

1665
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:59,180
This is, the quote says from Braun, the rendering tools are getting so good now for 3D animation

1666
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:03,300
you can literally create a linear animation and create a video game using the exact same

1667
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,300
objects.

1668
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,180
That's pretty cool.

1669
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:10,040
So I might have to check this one out myself, but they're basically saying that it could

1670
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,720
be a few years before the project's complete.

1671
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:18,340
They're also saying though, the hint is that the Oddworld games to be released in the future

1672
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:21,900
are going to be episodic.

1673
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:24,740
So that's kind of nifty.

1674
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:25,740
All right.

1675
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:28,380
It worked for Sam and Max.

1676
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:29,980
Well speak of episodic.

1677
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:32,700
It did not work for Shenmue.

1678
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:40,300
Well speaking of episodic content, Horlor, you may remember them of the World of Warcraft,

1679
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,700
apparently they got sued so they had to change their name, but Horlor, the fantasy porn series

1680
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:50,340
that's out there now that is based off of World of Warcraft, now they're branching off

1681
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:55,940
into a new online game to parody I guess in porn.

1682
01:19:55,940 --> 01:20:02,140
And that would be the Age of Conan with their brand new series, Horlor Presents, the Rage

1683
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,620
of Bonan.

1684
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:11,860
And it will actually feature the first episode, well lots of boning, but yeah the first episode

1685
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:15,940
is apparently going to be a recreation of one of the missions that you go on in the

1686
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:21,300
beginning of the game where you have to rescue some chick who is apparently tied up and then

1687
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:26,260
accept and this, they have sex with her, so interesting.

1688
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:31,340
But I mean, you know, they have some pretty interesting names for their episodes and stuff

1689
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:36,160
like the first one, I remember Horlor, or World of Warcraft, the first one Rogues Do

1690
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:41,580
It From Behind, gotta love that, and the nice Pirate Booty, yes.

1691
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:46,220
But if you're interested and you're of age, you can download these and purchase them at

1692
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,580
Horlor.com.

1693
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:52,500
You know, I was just thinking, it's been a while since we've had a video game porn crossover

1694
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:56,460
story because, you know, I was just, don't ask me why, but I was thinking the other day

1695
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:02,100
about Final Fuck X and how hilarious that porno was, have you ever seen Final Fuck X?

1696
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,100
This is great.

1697
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,100
Remember Dance Dance Fuck?

1698
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,380
It's basically boning some cosplayers.

1699
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:10,720
Yes, it's basically, it's Japanese porno and it's basically these girls are dressed up

1700
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:15,780
like Yuna and Riku and Lulu and they get fucked.

1701
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:19,700
I don't think it's the Final Fuck though, I think the title's a little deceiving.

1702
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,220
I have a feeling they get fucked again.

1703
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:24,820
And in case you haven't ever seen these before, they do have pictures all night and they do

1704
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:29,020
have the elf ears too, so it's like a, you know, a fanboy.

1705
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:35,020
They're very, very great costumes, they're really, no seriously, it's just very, very

1706
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,020
smart.

1707
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:41,620
I remember one week, if you, in OLR history, I remember one week when we reviewed Dance

1708
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:45,340
Dance Fuck live on air, because you actually got this porno somehow.

1709
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:49,660
I was looking for Dance Dance Revolution stuff on eBay, and I saw this and I'm like, I gotta

1710
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:51,660
buy this.

1711
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,180
There's actually a porno called Dance Dance Fuck, but they don't actually ever play Dance

1712
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:55,180
Dance Revolution.

1713
01:21:55,180 --> 01:22:01,780
No, it has the font, and then it's like Dance Dance Fuck like six max or something.

1714
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:05,660
Yeah, Dance Dance Fuck six max or something like that, it was so funny.

1715
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:11,260
Until you've seen live action Smurf porn, you ain't seen shit.

1716
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:17,100
But anyways, this company also, just so you know, they do have the first FPS porn as well.

1717
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:24,140
They have FPS porn episode one, and it is done in the style of an FPS shooter, so.

1718
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,140
One has to wonder what the gun is.

1719
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:27,780
That is interesting.

1720
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:31,780
Eight bucks, that's not bad.

1721
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,780
Very nice.

1722
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:38,260
That's the sound a lot of people will be making after watching it too.

1723
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:45,060
Alright, anyhow, a sound I'm gonna make right now is a very happy noise, a very happy bouncy

1724
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,060
noise.

1725
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:51,020
Oh, oh, oh, real quick, sorry, and I forgot to add one thing.

1726
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,020
You're interrupting his bouncy noise.

1727
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,740
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1728
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:58,780
In the Age of Conan, they actually have a guild for Horlor as well, and if you wanna

1729
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:03,740
sign up for their guild for Age of Conan, it's HorlorGuild.com.

1730
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:06,140
So yes, you too can be part of the Horlor.

1731
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:07,140
Nice.

1732
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:15,100
Alright, anyhow, I said happy music, so it's time to bring in the music that always marks

1733
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,900
our classic game of the week.

1734
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,220
Yes, that's right, it's the segment where Dark Soccer digs through the archives and

1735
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:26,180
picks a favorite classic game from gaming history to praise live here on air.

1736
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:29,040
So Dark Soccer, what should the kids be playing this week?

1737
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:35,540
The game that everybody should be playing is Typing of the Dead with bad voice acting.

1738
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:38,540
Yes, and that was what the gunshot was from, I apologize.

1739
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,540
The meeting G over there.

1740
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,540
What?

1741
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:55,980
Even the little baby voice sucks, but Typing of the Dead is a modification of House of

1742
01:23:55,980 --> 01:24:02,660
the Dead 2, which is the first person rail shooter, except in this one, phrases and words

1743
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:06,860
pop up and you have to type them to kill them.

1744
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:11,000
I've played an arcade version of this, it's quite difficult since I'm not too familiar

1745
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:18,140
with a Japanese keyboard, but I have the Dreamcast version of this game that you play with the

1746
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:23,300
Dreamcast keyboard and it's just really cracktastic and fun and kind of difficult really as you

1747
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,820
get to the boss battles because you have to be really freaking fast.

1748
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:31,620
On top of that you have to be really freaking accurate, because if you type wrong, then

1749
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:37,620
it won't put it in until you type it correctly.

1750
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:42,940
But I like that when they're walking around they have Dreamcasts on their back and keyboards

1751
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:45,260
in front of them instead of carrying their guns around.

1752
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:48,220
Unless you play the PC version, of course you can on game test.

1753
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,780
PC versions kind of ask, but...

1754
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,500
Hey, but it's all I got.

1755
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:58,300
Yeah, I can bring over my Dreamcast one day, but anyway, Typing of the Dead was just really

1756
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:03,380
fun, and it's so just...

1757
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:09,700
I guess it's good, it's just absurd basically, it's stupid, but it's really fun.

1758
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:13,260
And on top of that it has the worst voice acting ever which makes it even better.

1759
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:14,260
My God.

1760
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:19,540
I was like, there was nothing we could do.

1761
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:20,540
It's that epic.

1762
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:21,820
I don't want to die.

1763
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:25,780
I remember playing a game like this once at Arcade Infinity, I don't know if it was still

1764
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:26,780
Typing of the Dead.

1765
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:27,780
No, the one they had was Typing of the Dead.

1766
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,780
But it was in Japanese.

1767
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:29,780
Yeah.

1768
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:30,780
Okay.

1769
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:31,780
But it was the same game, just in Japanese.

1770
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:39,340
Well, the first few levels, if I do recall right, were mostly in English, but it was

1771
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,820
as you get the boss battles that they were using the...

1772
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:47,340
Yo, you could type, you could type, because they used English letters, it was just the

1773
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:50,420
Japanese words, so you could type it, you could play through the game, but when you

1774
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:54,300
got to the boss, there's one boss that asks questions, and that was the part where you

1775
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:58,900
always got screwed.

1776
01:25:58,900 --> 01:25:59,900
So there you have it.

1777
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:07,780
I also like that if you know how House of the Dead has little things you can find, well,

1778
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:11,100
they actually pop up as a letter to the head, I think that's pretty cool.

1779
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,100
That is cool.

1780
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,100
I like that.

1781
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,100
But I freaking love Typing of the Dead.

1782
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,100
I think it's about time that this game got some respect.

1783
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:22,060
All right, so there you have it, Typing of the Dead, your classic game of the week, available

1784
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:26,380
on Dreamcast, which is the preferred version for Jamie, or PC, if you must.

1785
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:28,260
Everything is better on Dreamcast.

1786
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:30,540
All right.

1787
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:31,540
Very good pick.

1788
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:33,820
Again, I'm surprised that that has never been picked before.

1789
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:35,940
Well, it hasn't been doing this that long.

1790
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:36,940
I guess so.

1791
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:37,940
But there you go.

1792
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:38,940
All right.

1793
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:39,940
Basically, you wanna know how we came across it?

1794
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:40,940
How we decided to?

1795
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:41,940
What's that?

1796
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:42,940
Because we went in the vault.

1797
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:43,940
Ah.

1798
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:44,940
Went in the vault.

1799
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:45,940
Tiara's nodding her head.

1800
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:46,940
Did you make Tiara go in the vault?

1801
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:47,940
Yeah.

1802
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:48,940
Tiara's like, I was in the vault.

1803
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:49,940
It was dark.

1804
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:50,940
It was cold.

1805
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:51,940
They tried to lock me in the vault.

1806
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:55,780
I grabbed a stack of games.

1807
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,780
And shot them in my head.

1808
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,780
And just kept going through them.

1809
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,780
Yeah, I did.

1810
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,780
And it was fun.

1811
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:02,180
But I kept going through them until I found Typing of the Dead.

1812
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,180
All right.

1813
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:04,820
But there were other games there that I might do later.

1814
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,540
Well, that's gonna do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio.

1815
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:08,540
But don't go away.

1816
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:12,500
We got plenty more to come in part B. There's still some more gaming news that we're gonna

1817
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,600
be talking about.

1818
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,600
So stay tuned.

1819
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,940
I mean, we haven't talked really about the Wii a whole lot yet.

1820
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,540
There's a lot of Wii news going on this week.

1821
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:23,300
Some other, the big piracy chip that's supposed to end piracy all together.

1822
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:24,300
We're gonna talk about that.

1823
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,740
I'm sure Loki has something he wants to say about that.

1824
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,740
And movies.

1825
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,740
Lots of game movie crossovers.
