9	5033	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast on May 11th, 2008.
5854	11979	It's Mother's Day, so if you forgot, you definitely owe your mother like a big bouquet of flowers.
12439	15702	So you should definitely call her if you haven't already.
16022	20806	Or, you know, whatever motherly figure is in your life because, you know, some single parents and so on.
20846	23768	Not everybody necessarily has a mom, but call somebody and tell them you love them.
23828	24649	Damn it, love is in the air.
25269	32691	Um, myself, DarkSakura, Loki, here with you on Orange Lounge Radio Part B. We're about to get back to some news, but first, we have some business to take care of.
33051	47115	We have to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Grand Theft Auto IV contest, which we're working with AllGames.com to give away a limited edition Xbox 360 Elite Grand Theft Auto IV.
47915	48636	Thanks for watching!
68536	69556	Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix
94994	105677	That's right, the highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMedia is back, and with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-fisting, ocean-pissing new songs danced in.
106117	114279	You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio hosts, like Rob Roberts.
115179	120981	When you call my name, it's like a little home prayer, I'm down on my knees.
121671	122992	I'm staying in.
124012	128234	I want the world to know I'm happy with the pussy.
128434	129254	DarkSakura?
130514	140298	Please note, there are no real songs sung by DarkSakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lunge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a boat fire on an ocean of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano.
140538	140838	Sorry.
140918	144120	You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan.
144460	147721	Don't get strung out by the way I look.
148863	151484	Don't judge a book by its cover.
151524	152844	John DMN Bresler.
153164	154245	You ever go to Duck Island?
155345	156766	Your mom goes to Duck Island.
158146	163848	And a ton of licensed music inspired by the show that the RIAA and Laura Steele UT don't want you to hear.
164161	169404	Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer, and you might as well just offer torrents on the website.
169504	172846	So come, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution's second mix.
172946	177648	When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplay.com.
177788	184192	It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting, FUCK.
184372	187753	See, he says at the end there, not guaranteed, Loki, that you will in fact dress up as Tingle.
187793	190294	It's still implying, though, that it was sales of...
211860	212581	All right, so there it is.
212641	213982	Congrats, SSJ100Matt.
214002	217164	But a big round of applause, everybody, please, to our finalists.
217184	218225	They were all very good.
218625	221707	And everybody that participated, we couldn't play them all in the final round.
221767	222307	I get two claps.
222467	223088	Yes, good job, you guys.
223108	224329	This is one more than you got for your mount.
224569	225109	All right, thank you.
225890	226810	Now, here's the thing, though.
226910	232854	Now we have to all throw our support behind SSJ100Matt as he moves into the final round, because I'll tell you what.
233335	238698	Because it's a bunch of OLR in-jokes, you know when they play that on All Games Interactive or however they decide to do the final.
238878	241260	There's a lot of people that are going to listen to that and go, what?
241961	242961	The hell is that?
243021	243702	Like, I don't get it.
244683	251569	So we all have to support SSJ100Matt now by making sure in the final voting phase we all go and vote for him because we want him to win.
251609	254972	We want to say that the winner came from OLR.
255492	258675	So be sure to throw your support behind him in the finalist round.
258695	262258	We'll give you more information on that next week when the voting should be up.
262778	266340	So check for that on our website as well a little later this week.
266440	266740	All right.
267041	268221	So congrats, SJ100, Matt.
268762	277767	Another giveaway to come later in the show, that res code finally going to be given away to somebody, thank God, in a new game coming up a little bit later.
277847	279047	But first, more news.
279227	280888	Loki, let's go back to some gaming news.
281168	283330	I don't want to watch the stock market too much, but...
285290	293697	I guess if you were hoping that Atari was going to make a big turnaround and become this really profitable company, well, no.
294298	306048	In fact, Nasdaq has actually delisted them from the stock exchange because they have failed to... Well, basically, they failed to submit the year-end financials.
306949	310472	And before that, the market value was way too low.
310552	312553	So they have been dropped...
313499	317102	Drop like an American Idol contestant who just couldn't make it.
317483	319805	Or an American Idol contestant's father from backstage.
320325	320946	Did you read about that?
321006	321567	Yes, I did.
321607	322167	Funny stuff.
322948	323588	Oh, wait.
323668	326691	Do we have more in the saga of one of the Davids?
326992	329214	I'm not letting this show turn into American Idol chat.
329294	329994	Not, not, not.
330195	334298	Yes, apparently someone's abusive daddy, you know, a la Michael Jackson.
334378	334979	Shut up!
339013	350299	Apparently there was a certain boo-boo, if you remember, last week with kind of doing... There was a cover of a song that he did that had the lyrics, Beautiful Girls, in it.
350399	351420	That caused him a lot of money.
351640	352560	I hate you guys.
354381	355942	And besides, that was cheap anyways.
356002	360645	That was as cheap as that one chick who was saying all the American Jesus-themed songs.
361225	364207	Anyways, so yeah, Satari got delisted from NASDAQ.
364567	368009	And yeah, they're just...
369212	370473	Going down a slippery slope.
370973	379780	Hopefully someone will buy them, and it will be a little bit more than all Dragon Ball Z Atari remake games.
380281	383483	Well, we reached out to Atari for comment, and this is all they had to say.
392511	392991	Bad joke.
393191	393892	Nobody's going to get it.
393972	394292	All right.
395493	396053	Chirp, chirp.
396093	396654	Take a shot.
397950	398531	LittleBigPlanet
421343	424904	Let's talk about new and exciting games as opposed to games that were out like 20 years ago.
425684	428725	LittleBigPlanet will be coming out in October.
429545	433026	This was announced at the PlayStation Day 2008 event in London.
433086	434586	It's from Kazurai himself.
434946	439988	He has confirmed that LittleBigPlanet is going to be making its way in October.
440028	444969	But one thing you should be aware of is that the open beta, not happening.
445925	452770	So if you were looking forward to the public beta that was promised several times for the game, nope, the public beta is going away.
453090	454070	So surprised.
454090	456892	It's a promise broken by Sony.
458573	461776	Hopefully there will be a demo or something, but don't hold your breath.
461816	463197	You'll probably just have to wait for the game to come out.
463217	464878	Let me just add another check mark on the board there.
466479	466659	Yeah.
467640	467900	All right.
469020	472483	But LittleBigPlanet will be making its way in October, unless it gets delayed again.
472503	472983	Who never knows?
473203	475285	It'll be all sorts of awesome whenever it comes out.
475525	475785	All right.
477883	501725	Well, for things that are to be coming out, as mentioned, is Home, which has been pushed back, pushed back, turned around, upside down, set on fire, and dropped in said underwater volcano, is going to be getting a fall release, which has been told us by SCEE President David Reeves, and said...
502646	503807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
522703	525645	However, it's not quite as prestigious as, say, Home.
525765	542273	The game is actually homeless, and you can find yourself participating in wonderful activities like sleeping on a park bench, spewing out obscenities, talking to a wall, and just not being cared for.
542293	546855	Okay, I need to do a quick poll in chat right now.
546915	548115	Quick poll in chat.
548456	550597	All right, which joke was funnier?
551693	555917	Loki's homeless joke or Rob's Atari joke?
557978	559640	Place vote now in chat.
561121	562042	In the main chat room.
562102	563083	I think, you know, it's funnier.
563123	564004	Which joke was funnier?
564024	564864	You know what's funnier?
565325	566045	Tonight's show.
567587	569348	Tonight's show is hilarious.
569989	571030	Hilarious.
571410	571710	All right.
571991	573492	Loki, go to the next story.
575427	576267	I hate you guys.
577107	577608	Oh, wait, wait.
577968	578268	Hold on.
578308	579768	We have the quick poll results are in.
580548	581489	Rob's Atari joke.
581669	582289	Rob's joke.
582409	582829	Atari.
582969	583249	Rob.
583389	583649	Rob.
583769	584589	Rob's Atari joke.
584689	584989	Rob's.
585069	585810	Rob's Atari joke.
586030	588570	Because Rob used the Atari Pac-Man dying sound.
588890	589151	Rob.
589251	590031	Rob's Atari joke.
590631	590831	Rob.
590871	591071	Rob.
591731	592191	Look at that.
592591	592952	I rock.
593592	594012	Whatever.
594172	594672	Love you, Loki.
596499	597599	So this isn't a big surprise.
597639	601361	There's rumors now that Daxter and Wipeout Pulse are going to be ported to the PS2.
601441	601721	Really?
601821	603621	PSP games are being ported to the PS2?
604141	605002	That's a first.
606442	613884	And this is coming from Jukes Video France, and they're just stating that, of course, those two games are being ported to the PS2.
613984	617285	I would say that's a pretty safe guess, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it.
619486	620886	Not a big surprise.
622219	626241	Alright, so now we gotta downgrade our games to get them to sell more.
626281	627241	Is that basically what this is?
627281	631543	Well, here's the thing too, is when they port them over, they don't enhance any of the graphics or anything.
631583	636926	In fact, I believe Ratchet & Clank Size Matters didn't look that good on the PS2.
637886	639387	Twisted Metal, pretty cool.
639687	641228	Silent Hill Origins, pretty cool.
642128	644089	But just, I don't know.
645632	646412	I don't need his stinking vote.
666306	668768	or his friendship on the PlayStation Network.
684286	685307	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
703704	704464	Thanks for watching!
724349	725510	I don't know.
725530	731456	The thing about Project Gotham for me is that it's a little heavy on the car shop and tuning your car and stuff.
731856	735419	I just want to play a really easy pick-up-and-race type game like F-Zero.
735439	737041	I think that's why I like F-Zero and Mario Kart.
737061	737821	They're really easy.
738202	739823	I want it easy and fast.
740103	741785	That's why I like F-Zero.
742005	743186	Because you get to drive so fast.
744147	748571	I seriously still say F-Zero GX is one of my favorite racing games ever.
749071	749652	This is great.
750573	750673	So...
752290	754452	We'll see, though, what Bizarre has in store for us.
754472	761116	Because, you know, they might just try something completely new out of left field that's going to make me go, da-da-da-da-da, want.
762677	764038	Might you say that, DarkSakura?
764058	765499	Da-da-da-da-want.
768061	768381	We'll see.
769722	798708	well speaking of stuff that came through via conference call how's that for tie-in it was actually stated by Activision Publishing CEO Mike Griffith that Guitar Hero has surpassed 15 million in individual song downloads so I guess rock bands got a little bit more to catch up with but then again Guitar Hero has been out longer so
801326	804069	In shorter time, Harmonix hit 10 million.
805691	812057	So I think that look at it in perspective of time and then see who's doing better.
812638	813238	That's what I say.
813479	815601	I sense a little bit of favoritism on your part.
815621	819445	Especially since Rock Band already had to deal with Guitar Heroes.
821367	822167	Sorry about that.
822408	823609	I'm setting up for something later.
823709	824430	Don't pay attention to that.
825083	842812	since um since Guitar Hero was already out and already had a loyal fan base when Rock Band came out so to hit 10 million after all that I think Rock Band's got and I'm looking at this just by terms of numbers and time that I think Rock Band's the more impressive hmm
843991	844812	Well, you know, I don't know.
844953	850282	Guitar Hero, I still like it because I think it's more fun to play guitar on Guitar Hero than it is on Rock Band.
850683	852165	But Rock Band's definitely the better part of the game.
852205	853047	I like hitting things.
853808	854369	Fuck that shit.
854389	855491	It's all about guitar freaks.
855511	856393	I don't know what you guys...
857532	860713	No, Guitar Freaks is kind of... No, Guitar Freaks!
861554	862434	Where's your loyalty?
862714	863874	Sorry, I defected.
864355	866976	Hey, I still love Beatmania 2DX.
866996	869577	And Keyboard Mania.
869617	872378	I will always have a soft, squishy spot in my heart for Keyboard Mania.
872878	878020	By the way, completely unrelated, and Loki, when you mentioned it, I had to look it up, and I think that's the most hilarious thing I've ever heard.
879700	880721	For the American Idol thing.
883134	883694	You know what?
883854	886096	Stop derailing the show with your idle chat.
886136	888077	Hey, it's only a few more weeks and then it's over.
888097	890518	Oh my god, I don't believe this.
890798	892820	I'm the reality TV whore of you three.
892960	896522	I am hosting a freaking Survivor game on LiveJournal right now.
896922	899263	That's what a whore I am for reality TV.
899564	901985	And it's you two that derail me.
902666	905608	I explained the other night this isn't reality TV.
905669	906670	It's a talent contest.
906710	907370	There's a difference.
907430	910133	It's not a bunch of people acting like retards.
910793	912655	You don't see anything into their personal life on the show.
912675	913977	I like people acting like retards.
913997	915078	She doesn't have a point.
915318	916219	It is a contest.
916379	916999	It is a contest.
917020	920323	You're not looking at how these people are living in their daily lives.
920343	921003	And thank God for that.
921023	921344	They just...
921844	942431	interview them you're not following them as they're trying to build a hut out of coconut leaves wouldn't it be more fun if the idols did have to build no no no no because you see this is why I don't watch any of the results show and I just read the winner online because I don't like watching tons of Ford commercials being you know their little musical numbers
943231	947416	I actually have not watched a physical episode on TV this year.
947436	951161	All I have to say is I'm missing the Survivor Micronesia finale tonight to be here.
951201	956006	And if you spoil it in chat, I will punch you in the face and it will hurt.
956166	956887	You've got TiVo.
957388	958269	I know, but still.
959410	960111	You have TiVo.
960732	962354	I have YouTube on my phone at work.
962762	963803	Thanks for watching!
978616	989867	Well, there's rumors now that Activision is partnering with Nintendo to release Nintendo DS bundles that will include the DS system as well as Guitar Hero on Tour.
990207	995772	It'll be the first third-party kind of combo pack that they've done with the DS so far.
996453	1000076	So that's kind of neat, whoring the game out a bit.
1000336	1001237	Yes, I guess.
1003439	1014927	I don't know, I would say that you would need the black and red, or crimson black DS, so it would look pretty cool with this, but I don't know, it's neat, I guess.
1017388	1027735	I think, what was I going to say, I think that they're doing, I think Guitar Hero 4 is coming out in DS too, so you're not going to have to worry about just playing on tour for a long time.
1030568	1033530	Are they really going to move that many DS units with this one game?
1034690	1037072	I think it's going to sell pretty well.
1037232	1040434	I mean, it's innovative, I guess.
1040994	1041994	It's innovative, I guess.
1042735	1045757	I mean, it's an interesting peripheral, let me put it that way.
1047197	1047718	You know what?
1048298	1048558	What?
1048918	1053681	I don't think it's an original idea at all because the WonderSwan had the Beatmania wheel.
1054982	1055562	Scratch table.
1057296	1057956	But this is different.
1057976	1058596	This is much different.
1058616	1062457	There's been games that's had add-ons of a similar nature.
1064218	1073660	I'm not saying that add-ons... I think it's an interesting add-on because I know one, like, I'm thinking Guitar Hero for the DS before they ever showed off this, you know, guitar grip thing.
1074141	1077481	I'm thinking you tap in the screen, you know, to be the music type thing.
1077581	1080002	So this is definitely a lot better than that.
1080822	1081122	I don't know.
1081623	1082983	Be interesting to see what they do with it.
1084349	1085130	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1112588	1112988	Thanks for watching!
1133498	1133879	I don't know.
1134059	1138222	Something tells me there will be some type of instrument we haven't thought of yet that's going to be in it somehow.
1138282	1139102	I mean, come on, Rob.
1139122	1143546	Look at the Wii, okay, and the Wii Wheel when they made that announcement.
1143706	1151011	That was a big step in innovation to them, despite the fact that there had been third-party games that had done that since the Wii launch.
1151591	1152752	So it's retarded.
1153393	1158356	They just, you know, pat themselves on the back and stuff, you know, fluff themselves, I don't know what.
1158496	1160338	But it's just, it's retarded.
1161799	1161999	Nice.
1166011	1168752	So, Guitar Hero 4, we'll see.
1168892	1171033	We'll get more news on it later, I guess.
1171693	1173674	And I'm sure we'll be shocked and awed.
1174854	1175374	But not really.
1175794	1177035	Because we already kind of figured it out.
1177875	1178876	Are we shocked and awed?
1179116	1179276	Nope.
1179656	1180716	Are we just going, aww?
1181457	1181737	Maybe.
1182717	1186038	Well, guess what else should be getting some downloadable content?
1186218	1186418	What?
1187199	1187519	Sort of.
1188579	1189500	Samba de Amigo.
1190060	1190420	And we?
1191771	1193872	Wait, you mean downloadable content on the Wii?
1194953	1195853	How is this possible?
1195913	1198554	Explain yourself.
1199155	1208419	They were taking a look at the cover for Samba de Amigo and at the top is Wii's Pay to Play logo.
1209600	1213842	So it could be indicative of some downloadable content.
1214926	1215907	Pay to Play.
1242526	1243707	Where are my maracas?
1243747	1248192	I'm sure some third-party company will put out cheap plastic maraca cases for your... Maraca attachment.
1248292	1248593	Yeah.
1249654	1250034	Why not?
1250134	1252036	I want my maracas and I want to pose.
1252457	1253358	Damn it, I'm just going to bust out.
1253378	1254559	I'm sure the posing will be there.
1255059	1255760	I want maracas.
1256020	1257622	We could develop our own maraca attachment.
1257642	1258183	Here's the thing, though.
1258203	1259604	I bet you anything because the...
1262307	1263928	The space on the Wii is so limited.
1263988	1266911	I bet you anything it is not pay to download content.
1266971	1268372	It's pay to unlock content.
1268852	1269453	Because why not?
1269493	1271774	It's working on the 360 with games like Katamari.
1272275	1275998	And we need to stop referring to these things as downloadable content and call them what they are.
1276058	1278039	You are paying to unlock something already on the disc.
1278139	1280021	You know, though, I don't know if that might be the case.
1280081	1283444	Because, I mean, this stuff could be like MP3 format or something very similar.
1283464	1285905	You're not actually making the music to the game.
1285986	1287206	It's just going along with it.
1287307	1287867	Perhaps.
1288207	1289949	The Dreamcast ones were actually downloadable.
1290569	1290689	Samba 2000
1306706	1308187	Samba de Amigo Samba de Amigo
1333325	1337080	Well, while we're waiting for actual download content on the Wii, whether...
1338342	1340443	I guess Samba de Amigo is going to be the first one or not.
1340923	1349925	In the meantime, though, in July, we are going to be getting something not quite downloadable, but expanding on with Rock Band Track Pack Volume 1.
1350106	1352046	It's coming to the PlayStation 2 and the Wii.
1352666	1358188	What's kind of neat about this game, actually, it's not really adding on to the game.
1358228	1360128	I mean, it's almost like its own game.
1360689	1362169	It has its own songs.
1362189	1364330	They've got a list of about...
1365523	1368544	I want to say there's 10-15 tracks there.
1369485	1383872	All stuff that's currently available on Xbox Live, Arcade, and PlayStation Network like 30 Seconds to Mars, The Kill, Blink-182, all the small things, Kiss, Calling Dr. Love, and so on.
1385232	1389654	If you don't own Rock Band, you can just buy this for $29.99 if you want.
1389674	1391395	I guess it will contain 20 songs.
1393513	1394555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1403154	1403394	Interesting.
1424747	1425327	Alright, well.
1425748	1427429	Or you could just pay to download the songs.
1427489	1428409	I mean, you could just do that.
1428509	1435074	Well, you know, or if you own a PlayStation 2 and a Wii, or a Wii, I guess, you don't really have the option.
1435754	1436875	Thank you, Nintendo.
1438089	1440490	Well, there's some more rock band news.
1440570	1449916	It's kind of interesting this week, and it has to do with more rock band tracks, but this time it's free tracks, and we like free, but it's kind of the way that you get them, which is very interesting.
1449936	1458240	The band Disturbed, apparently, is going to be having some tracks in rock band, and the only way you get this is by pre-ordering their latest CD, which I think is Indestructible.
1458381	1458901	Is that what it's called?
1459441	1465505	You pre-order the CD, and then you actually can get the songs that apparently will not be going public until June.
1466445	1467045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1496725	1497066	with it.
1497986	1504712	And, you know, it's not the first time South Park would have tied into Rock Band, because think, Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld is one of the unlocked songs in the game, which is pretty awesome.
1504772	1506374	I hope it's actual, like, South Park songs.
1506414	1507635	I hope they're South Park songs, too.
1507675	1509837	Like, DVD-A, Now You're a Man.
1510337	1512119	Or, uh, Shut Your Fucking Face, Uncle Fucka.
1512639	1514041	I'd love some of the stuff from the movie.
1514121	1514781	That would be great.
1515222	1516042	Or, uh, what was the song?
1516483	1517864	Little Boy, You're Going to Hell.
1518705	1519045	Remember that?
1519065	1520246	That had a good guitar riff in it.
1521127	1521787	That'd be great.
1522828	1523189	We'll see.
1524500	1527823	Alright, in the meantime, we're going to take a little trip to our mailbag.
1527883	1535849	Every week, you guys email us at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com and DarkSakura rips open the email bag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails to read for you guys.
1536350	1540233	Unfortunately, though, it's slim pickings in the mailbag this week.
1540833	1542494	Sounds like not a lot of folks emailed us.
1542514	1546357	DarkSakura's going to pick her two favorite emails tonight to read for you right now.
1546838	1550781	But if you want to email us for a future week, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
1550821	1551622	DarkSakura, take it away.
1552250	1558495	Well, I did get a couple from Rob with two Bs, but I'm actually still reading over them, so I'll have to save them for next week.
1559035	1561077	First one comes from Katamaris Forever.
1561838	1563819	Good Sunday to you, OLR.
1564580	1565781	That's so pleasant.
1566641	1569444	I'd like to start my letter regarding what I wrote last week.
1569684	1578211	Having copied down what Actdeft said on Part B two weeks ago, I tried removing Photo Channel, but since I didn't download it in the first place, it wasn't there to delete.
1579711	1591315	I would also like to state that since the show reaches 1am in Michigan, I usually go live during Part A and go to sleep during the beginning of Part B. I can't thank you enough for providing podcasts through your RSS feed so that I can listen later.
1591955	1596777	Now, I would like to address a popular issue that I've seen recently in games.
1597197	1597737	Their ratings.
1599102	1607773	It seems that every new release title gets to be a number one on aggregate sites like GamerKings, only to fall down to the top 30 a week later.
1608414	1616884	Do exclusive reviews usually skew opinions, hence the 100% that PS3 version of Grand Theft Auto 4 is getting?
1617745	1624652	I mean, sure, the first reviews usually spew out love, but it's usually the first people who influence the next, right?
1624792	1631638	If so, for example, GameSpot gave a game like Okami for Wii a 9.0 when the other reviewers follow suit.
1631998	1633079	I guess it's just buzz.
1633580	1635201	Which brings me to my other point.
1635542	1636302	Where's Bioshock?
1637383	1643125	In a mere amount of months, the 2007 game of the year just vanished out of thin air.
1643625	1651367	Nowadays, I don't hear a peep about this legendary game anymore, but just who whooped who in brawl and testimonials about GTA 4.
1651787	1654808	Seriously, I've got a friend who calls this game, quote, the truth.
1655969	1658269	The truth.
1658850	1659790	Really, that ADD?
1661297	1665964	Yes Two random things I want to address Why does Rob hate Toadette?
1666525	1672634	She's just the same as Toad and Mario Kart Wii is very nice but bikes seem unusable when playing with the Wii wheel
1673373	1673853	Mario and Wario
1694364	1698566	Luigi, and Waluigi, Donkey Kong, and Diddy Kong.
1720225	1720885	Can I continue?
1721065	1721326	You may.
1721926	1722866	Sorry about the long letter.
1722906	1724707	I'll be sure to talk about something else next time.
1724787	1725708	Katamari's forever.
1726108	1733512	Change is inevitable except at the Olive Garden where endless soup, salad, and breadsticks are $9.95 every day excluding Australia LOL.
1735133	1740275	I love how all of our emails now have to end their email with some type of Home of the Neverending or Olive Garden reference.
1740515	1740796	Love it.
1741736	1743277	Hey Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki.
1744258	1746920	Thank you for playing my entry for the contest on the show.
1747380	1749802	And I'm glad you guys liked it and said it was great.
1749822	1750883	That really means a lot to me.
1751283	1757988	It's a shame that few people are entering to win, but I guess that most people listening already own an Xbox 360 or PS3.
1758448	1761930	I'm curious to hear the other entries for the contest, though, so keep us informed.
1762991	1766714	Oh yeah, I've got a story for you guys about how I got to know your podcast.
1768191	1770632	I was actually looking for podcasts with lounge music.
1771393	1776695	So I typed lounge podcast and something like that into Google and it led me to your website.
1776795	1783939	I downloaded an episode and the beginning was like Sky's famous intro beginning with video games, video gaming, and gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
1784279	1786841	Being a gamer myself, I thought, hey, I'll check this out.
1787141	1788521	And I actually laughed my ass off.
1789522	1790843	And I was immediately hooked.
1792343	1797226	So there you have it, a somewhat unusual way of getting to know you guys, but the name Orange Lounge Radio really paid off.
1799453	1807300	which is funny because a lot of times I think we haven't been discovered because our title does not have game in it and people are like, what does Orange Lounge have to do with video games?
1808161	1810123	So it's just kind of funny that the reverse worked.
1810143	1810784	It's ditter.
1811124	1811604	That's great.
1812425	1815368	By the way, Sky, you do sound like Lazlo from GTA a lot.
1815408	1815928	Smile face.
1816469	1818330	But that's not a bad thing because he's so funny.
1818751	1819251	Oh, okay then.
1819511	1819932	I forgive you.
1820652	1821573	Keep up the great show.
1821773	1822774	Lots of love from Belgium.
1823014	1823275	Martin.
1823789	1831511	Okay, now, DarkSakura, it occurred to me you weren't here last week, so you didn't hear his entry, but the problem was he was ineligible.
1831651	1832271	I did hear it.
1832391	1832611	You did?
1832631	1833551	I played it the week before.
1834391	1834491	Oh.
1834771	1836572	This was the really... Oh, you know what it was?
1836772	1839272	I didn't play it on air that time you heard it.
1839652	1839992	Yeah.
1840132	1840873	Okay, then you've heard it.
1841093	1841353	All right.
1841693	1842173	Yeah.
1842293	1842613	Yeah.
1843173	1844693	But we played it on air last week, right?
1845633	1845914	Yeah.
1846134	1849554	That's what I thought, and you weren't here last week, so... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1849594	1849754	What?
1849894	1850494	We have one more.
1851295	1851715	Okay.
1852195	1852795	Better be short.
1853829	1855090	It's really short.
1855151	1856712	It's from GS68.
1857072	1859655	Hey, OLR crew, I've got seven words for Black Wolf.
1860416	1861737	What do you have against the ferret?
1863279	1863719	I don't know.
1863759	1865941	We'll have to ask.
1866102	1867523	I hit him last week when you weren't here.
1867543	1868424	You butt.
1868897	1869337	No, I don't know.
1869357	1870078	I actually don't know.
1870118	1871439	I seriously don't know where the ferret is.
1871539	1872400	It's somewhere around here.
1872440	1873140	He's hiding from Bobby.
1873160	1873961	Hopefully I threw him away.
1874642	1874762	No!
1874782	1875342	No, I'm just kidding.
1876063	1876943	He's hiding from Bobby.
1877664	1879766	I think it's... You traumatized the baby ferret.
1879866	1890134	I think there's a little bit of rivalry between our mascot, the ferret, and Bobby, and I'm not sure who it belongs to, Bobby or Super Happy Funtime Show, but Clicky the Pen.
1890474	1891815	I think there's some type of rivalry there.
1891835	1892536	Clicky the Pen.
1892696	1892936	Yes.
1894778	1896139	But the ferret has cuteness.
1897096	1898617	That's true, but the pen goes click.
1898877	1900258	But the pens are also useful.
1900539	1900839	All right.
1902020	1902340	Anyhow.
1903361	1905822	Parrots are useful, too, because you can throw them at your co-host.
1906463	1907303	If you can find it.
1907744	1908044	All right.
1908524	1909985	Hey, you watch.
1910045	1910966	I'll find another parrot.
1912087	1912447	All right.
1913228	1914569	That's it for the email this week.
1914649	1919772	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com if you have some emails you would like to contribute.
1919872	1925997	But we've got some more gaming news, and then we are minutes away from a brand new OLR game launch.
1927011	1928272	You don't even know what it is yet.
1928492	1929993	I think it's going to be fun.
1930213	1930713	I'm excited.
1931073	1932814	Or it will suck and we'll never play it again.
1932874	1933895	That's what happens to games.
1933915	1935916	They're either really good or they suck and we never play them again.
1936256	1936517	All right.
1938098	1940079	Let's go over to Loki for another story.
1941440	1942680	All right.
1943141	1951445	So this isn't a big surprise because they were talking that Bazaar was going to be working on a new Bond game.
1951986	1952246	Well,
1952918	1954299	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1983186	1983806	We'll have to see.
1984107	1990832	But the film is being released in the UK on October 31st, November 7th in North America.
1990992	1992773	Does that mean that we'll actually get the game then?
1994675	1995936	Or do you think we'll have to wait for the DVD?
1996096	1997037	I think it'll come out fourth.
1997477	1998838	Why does it say third quarter?
1998898	1999739	It's fourth quarter.
2000039	2003102	I guess third quarter financial quarter, I guess, for them.
2004563	2005784	But yeah, fourth quarter.
2005924	2007365	So that would make sense.
2008140	2008400	Doom 4
2023520	2025602	But Doom 4 is on its way.
2026082	2039212	And CEO Todd Hollinsheet said this week in a press release, quote, Doom is part of the ID software DNA and demands the greatest talent and brightest minds in the industry to bring the next installment of our flagship franchise to Earth.
2040313	2042234	There are no other details given at this time.
2042314	2046077	Speculation is that ID's Tech 5 engine will be used.
2047238	2047758	And who knows?
2048058	2050640	And story-wise, who knows where this game could go?
2051001	2054563	But then again, if the movie didn't kill the franchise, then it could go anywhere.
2055143	2056004	So, Doom 4.
2056124	2057065	Are you excited about Doom 4?
2057105	2057325	No.
2058546	2061348	Doom 3 looked really awesome, but I don't know.
2061368	2063849	It didn't have the charm of Doom 1 and Doom 2 for me.
2064030	2064990	I never really liked Doom.
2065010	2066732	Are you playing Doom for the charm?
2066752	2067432	Yes, for the charm.
2067692	2070713	I like Doom 1 and 2 for the mods, but that's about it.
2070873	2072234	I didn't really care for the games.
2072734	2074414	I didn't even really get into Quake either.
2074734	2076755	Duke Nukem 3D, that was my game.
2076935	2077915	You know what I liked about Doom?
2078356	2080396	I just, you know, I don't know.
2080436	2082117	Wolfenstein, that was a good game.
2083274	2084374	Just Doom didn't do it for me.
2084695	2090397	I think mainly Doom didn't do it for me because at the time my PC couldn't run it.
2090857	2094738	Only had one meg of RAM, so it was a little tough to run that game.
2095178	2100560	Your friend and mine, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, ID makes great engines, they don't make great games.
2101701	2107383	I liked the first Doom because, first of all, it had a difficulty level called Hurt Me Plenty.
2108383	2110023	And secondly, the Wolfenstein levels.
2110684	2111064	Alright.
2111744	2115767	It's all about ID and IDDQD and IDBFG.
2116047	2117869	Don't forget Hexen and how freaking awesome that game is.
2117889	2119970	Hexen was great because of the NRA code.
2120851	2121431	All weapons.
2122272	2122572	Hi.
2123333	2123693	All right.
2124413	2125434	And God mode was Satan.
2127215	2127496	Awesome.
2128036	2128276	All right.
2128316	2129997	We are going to go to the Skype line.
2130018	2135842	In fact, if you heard a little background noise, it's because we already picked it up where we have two people sitting on the Skype line right now, if I'm not mistaking.
2136062	2137243	Toshin, you are there, correct?
2137263	2137423	Correct.
2138223	2138604	Yes, I am.
2146989	2147789	Doing very well, actually.
2147829	2148090	Thank you.
2148250	2154592	Alright, now we've got a little bit of a score to settle, and I don't even know how this came about, but it turned out that we have this Rev... Rev?
2154932	2162295	Rescode we've been trying to give away for, like, I don't know, like two months, and somehow we found out that you two didn't have it.
2162515	2167337	And which is so funny, because tonight, like, everybody's been PMing me, like, I wanna play, I wanna play, because I want the code.
2167617	2176081	But no, no, we said a couple weeks ago it was gonna be Toshin versus Footy, but we originally said we were gonna play the match game, but I hate to break it to you guys, we thought of something new.
2176641	2179103	So we're going to subject you to a new game tonight because we can do that.
2179143	2179564	It's our show.
2180504	2181665	I am very scared about this.
2181765	2182306	You should be.
2182386	2183207	Are you scared, Toshin?
2184247	2184608	Yes.
2184888	2185148	All right.
2185649	2191674	Well, let's unveil the game that Toshin and Footy will be playing tonight for the Rez HD Code.
2195076	2197318	That's right.
2198459	2204945	It's the OLR Family Feud will be what Toshin and Footy are playing tonight.
2206499	2207600	Alright, here's the deal.
2209241	2215146	We have surveyed several OLR personalities in different video gaming categories.
2215286	2216887	The OLR family, if you will.
2217248	2221431	And you two will be competing against each other head to head to see who can earn more points.
2221471	2222792	Here's how you earn more points.
2223593	2227576	You're going to pick a number 1 through 4 that will be the board that you play when it's your turn.
2228216	2232839	And, uh, on the board are the top answers in a particular video gaming category.
2232859	2234820	Like, let's say, best game ever.
2235360	2240824	And you can take turns at the board to see what the hosts and our friends would have said was the best game ever.
2241364	2244826	Um, if you don't guess correctly, you guess something that's not on the board, you get a strike.
2245246	2252991	Three strikes, and it will go to the other player who will get one chance to steal the board and all of your points.
2253051	2256053	So you definitely, uh, don't want to have your board stolen.
2256113	2256273	So...
2256993	2258515	Are you familiar with the show, Toshin?
2259476	2259936	Yes, I am.
2259996	2261297	Are you familiar with the show, Footy?
2262178	2263539	I have no idea what you just said.
2265381	2267283	Well, then you're in trouble, my friend.
2267563	2267783	All right.
2267924	2268784	Well, here's the thing.
2268985	2270646	We'll have Toshin go first then.
2271107	2275090	So that way, Footy, hopefully you can figure out what's going on quickly.
2275150	2275431	All right?
2276380	2277941	Okay, basically, it comes down to what?
2277981	2283284	I have to say a name of a person that would have said what is the best game to them?
2283445	2284585	Not a person, not a person.
2284645	2287467	Let's say the category was best video game ever made.
2287787	2292951	Like, since you know that I answered it, you would probably guess that Super Metroid is somewhere on the board.
2293171	2294091	And then you'd hear, ding.
2294412	2297214	But if you guessed, you know, a game that none of us... It's kind of like a bingo thing.
2297234	2301196	Like, if you guessed Crysis, then you'd hear, eh, because none of us would have picked that.
2301756	2303438	You know, so, because we're not Sakura Max.
2303478	2303998	So, okay.
2304018	2304098	Okay.
2304238	2307160	So you're going to be telling us whose names are on the board?
2307440	2307600	Yes.
2307620	2308601	And then I have to guess the name?
2309381	2309942	Yes, I'm going to.
2310082	2310943	No, you don't have to guess the name.
2310963	2312764	You just have to guess the answers that are on the board.
2313264	2314105	This is getting complicated.
2314185	2314385	All right.
2314645	2315025	That's all right.
2315406	2315626	All right.
2315666	2318387	Here is the OLR family that have contributed to tonight's answers.
2318648	2323591	Myself, Rob Roberts, DarkSakura, Loki has contributed to the board tonight.
2323651	2325792	Bobby Blackwolf contributed to the board tonight.
2326473	2328714	Miklatov contributed to the board tonight.
2328814	2333137	Rice Princess and DMN all have contributed answers to the board.
2334698	2360940	possible answers but sometimes answers are worth more because multiple people said them like for instance if it had been best game ever Chrono Trigger probably would have been worth like three points so does that make sense yeah alright here we go oh we have to do it just like they do on the show let's play the feud I said let's play the feud where's the damn music there we go let's play the feud alright
2361758	2362479	Alright, stop music.
2362739	2363240	Alright, here we go.
2363780	2365923	Toshin, since you know what you're doing, we're going to have you go first.
2365943	2370468	So Toshin, do you want board number one, board number two, board number three, or board number four?
2371434	2372134	3 Doom Doom
2402540	2403501	Where's my sound effect?
2404781	2406022	Family Feud's broken.
2406803	2407283	No!
2407623	2409184	I said is Doom on the board?
2410245	2412246	Alright, ding ding ding, yes, Doom is on the board.
2412686	2413727	Alright, so you get one point.
2413767	2414508	It's worth one point.
2415128	2416909	So, Toshin, you have one point so far.
2417610	2417950	Alright.
2418390	2420351	Doom is definitely on the sound board.
2420691	2420952	Alright.
2421972	2423493	Doom is all over my sound board tonight.
2423913	2426035	Alright, guess again, Toshin.
2426055	2426735	You have no strikes.
2427616	2428957	Best first impression shooting game ever.
2430270	2430610	Quake.
2431350	2431871	Quake.
2431991	2434211	Now we all have to applaud and say, good answer, good answer.
2434672	2434992	All right.
2435732	2437312	Is Quake on the board?
2438233	2438693	I'm sorry.
2438753	2440033	Quake is not on the board.
2440073	2441354	That's one strike against you.
2442134	2442474	All right.
2442854	2443415	Make another guess.
2445215	2445815	Wolfenstein.
2446536	2447356	Wolfenstein.
2447416	2448776	Is Wolfenstein on the board?
2452358	2454118	It's two strikes against you, Toshin.
2454138	2454698	I'm sorry.
2455078	2455279	All right.
2455319	2457879	Now, Footy, be prepared to steal if it comes over to you.
2458200	2458480	All right.
2459844	2462386	Toshin, what's another first person shooting game?
2463207	2463507	Halo.
2464348	2464969	Halo!
2465649	2466810	Show me Halo!
2466830	2472075	Oh, that's three strikes, Toshin.
2472616	2474658	Alright, Footy, it's your chance to steal.
2474918	2481284	You'll get one point and whatever other points you get for the answer if you can guess what's on the board for best first person shooting game ever.
2482910	2489354	Okay, um, he said, sorry, Wolfenstein, Quake, and, uh, which other, do you say, Toshin?
2489794	2490514	I can't say anything.
2490574	2492796	I know you should have been paying attention.
2492816	2494336	Okay, fine, that's how you are, okay?
2494416	2495877	I get it.
2496037	2496738	Things are getting dirty.
2500380	2502081	Um, Duke Nukem 3D.

2507423	2508944	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
2509044	2510805	Yes, it's the number one answer.
2510905	2515407	In fact, three people, Rob, Loki, and Irene all said Duke Nukem 3.
2515507	2516888	I knew Loki would have said that.
2517088	2522231	All right, so Footy, you just stole Toshin's point and three of your own.
2522291	2524192	Now you've got four points from that board.
2524252	2525293	Toshin has zero.
2525833	2527434	Toshin, stop embarrassing Canada.
2528094	2528915	All right, no, I'm just kidding.
2529615	2530196	You're doing a good job.
2530436	2532037	All right, let's look at what else was on the board.
2532317	2533978	Jamie said Doom, for the record, by the way.
2534298	2535859	All right, the remaining answers were...
2536539	2539181	Portal, said Bobby Blackwolf.
2540061	2542863	Unreal Tournament 2003, said Miklatov.
2543444	2545225	Perfect Dark, said DMN.
2545245	2546806	Alright, those are the other answers that you didn't guess.
2546826	2548207	Wow, no Golden I Love there?
2548527	2550248	No Golden I Love, I'm surprised too.
2550608	2552610	Alright, Footy, it's your turn.
2552650	2553770	Which board do you want to go for?
2555111	2555732	That was what, 4-3, right?
2556533	2557153	Now it's board three.
2557173	2558513	You want board one, two, or four?
2558713	2560554	Oh, now the ding noise loads.
2561234	2562414	Like an hour later.
2563654	2565455	Then give me board two.

2571536	2572716	Just one game name.
2572736	2573777	We're not looking for a song.
2573817	2576277	We're looking for like a game as a whole with the best soundtrack.
2576317	2578358	So best music in a game.
2578998	2580098	What is your guess, Footy?
2581328	2582668	Castlevania Symphony of the Night?
2583068	2584909	Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
2584929	2585629	That's a good guess.
2585669	2586229	Good answer.
2586349	2586729	Good answer.
2586749	2587730	Show me Symphony of the Night.
2589270	2591070	Oh, that's a strike, Footy.
2591390	2591711	I know.
2591771	2593551	I'm kind of surprised, too, that didn't come up.
2593771	2594271	What the hell?
2594451	2595772	Well, there's lots of games out there.
2596072	2596332	All right.

2609115	2609795	Dance Dance Revolution.
2610305	2611646	Portal, ShowMePortal
2642104	2644727	Oh, three strikes and no points, footy.
2645127	2652133	Well, Toshin, you can still steal the board and earn a point if you can correctly guess what anybody in the OLR family named best music in a game.
2652633	2653034	Toshin.
2653054	2654175	World of Warcraft.

2661060	2661861	Oh, God.
2661901	2663282	You guys sucked on that one.
2663302	2663763	That's all right.
2664283	2665044	It was pretty tough.

2686929	2689091	So all of those games were on the board.
2689451	2690191	Nothing is selected here.
2690251	2691092	I had good guesses.
2691432	2691953	I'm sorry.
2691973	2693434	I had guesses and I'm very happy with myself.
2693694	2694834	You did have good guesses.
2694995	2695295	All right.
2696155	2697156	We have a comment in the chat.
2697176	2700979	TheRobD says, Toshin and FootyMonster equals bad Family Feud players.

2711686	2713507	TheRobD, I hate, hate, hate, hate you.
2713948	2714248	All right.
2715680	2718282	Toshin, board number one and board number four are left.
2718342	2719984	It's your last go at the game.
2720004	2720424	What do you want?
2721485	2721585	One.
2722286	2723547	Board number one.
2723667	2729693	The category is best female video game character ever.
2730513	2730954	All right.
2731274	2733176	Top five answers are on the board.

2773333	2774134	Alright, Toshin.
2777639	2778460	Three points on the board.

2793343	2795244	Actually, DarkSakura says that's a bad answer.
2796005	2796485	Shut up.
2796565	2797626	Come on.
2798086	2801188	Remember, I have my game saved so I can watch her die over and over again.
2801208	2801488	You know what?
2801508	2803069	There's seven people that put in answers.
2803109	2804030	Somebody might have liked Eris.
2804050	2804390	Let's see.
2804430	2805491	Did anybody like Eris?
2807973	2808293	No.
2808373	2809073	Nobody likes Eris.
2809093	2810014	Because they have taste.
2810714	2811074	All right.
2811395	2811775	That's okay.
2812035	2813156	Two strikes, Toshin.
2813516	2814276	It's not over yet.
2814337	2814757	Toshin.

2830956	2832536	Oh, it's three strikes.
2832596	2833516	All right, that's all right, Toshin.
2833536	2834317	Don't be too frustrated.
2834357	2837077	All right, Footy, your chance to steal the board and the three points.
2837117	2841418	If you can guess one of the remaining four answers on the board, best female video game character ever.
2843559	2844439	Oh, Jesus Christ.
2844459	2845179	This is hard.
2845199	2845759	There's too many.
2846212	2855141	I would say all of them, but... Chun-Li, why not?
2855901	2859304	Chun-Li, if you get this right, you will have seven points.
2859364	2865610	If you get it wrong, Toshi finally gets on the board with three points.
2866231	2867993	Is Chun-Li up there?
2869963	2871363	Is my soundboard going to work?
2872144	2872644	No!
2873084	2874744	Is Chun-Li up there?
2875524	2877745	No, Chun-Li's not on the damn board.
2878425	2881386	Alright, so DingDingDingTotion gets the three points.
2881426	2882646	It's now three to four.
2884406	2886207	Three points Canada, four points Argentina.
2886227	2886527	What's that?
2887127	2891988	As the sound man behind the scenes here, if you're picking a different sample, you can double click on it.
2892008	2893769	If it's the same sample, you have to hit play.
2894049	2894849	Alright, thank you.
2894889	2895289	Now I know.
2898788	2901849	Toshin, I want you to say Toshi!
2903049	2904089	Get back to the game, please.
2904249	2905069	Alright, here we go.
2905710	2922073	The correct answer is Rob said Princess Peach, Loki said Mai because of her assets, Bobby Blackwolf said GLaDOS, and DMN said Morrigan from the Darkstalkers.
2922093	2923933	I guess it was in the 2D fighter area.
2924613	2924993	That's right.
2925053	2926314	Alright, here we go.
2926334	2927374	I said Samus Aran.
2929975	2931016	You were one of three that said that.
2931036	2931976	That was big money there.
2932016	2933978	Special Ed.
2934938	2935779	Love you.
2935939	2937080	One board left.
2938440	2941342	It's all going to come down to this one right here in footy.
2941402	2942083	It's your board.
2942163	2943123	Here's the category.
2943223	2944064	It's a toughy footy.
2944484	2945865	You're going to hate this board.
2946225	2946425	Ready?
2947506	2950568	Best Atari 2600 game ever.
2952389	2954210	Top seven answers are on the board.
2954250	2955571	Everyone said something different.
2956772	2957012	Okay.
2958731	2973343	Pitfall Pitfall, show me Pitfall Strike Good guess though What the hell was on the Atari 2600 anyways?
2973823	2987034	Can't remember for the love of me Pac-Man Pac-Man, the abortion of a game on the Atari 2600 I'm just kidding That we made fun of earlier in the show Someone might have picked it, I don't know
2987921	2990041	Alright, show me Pac-Man!
2994122	2994662	That was a no.
2995302	2999403	Alright, why are you laughing?
3000103	3001483	It's not like he said E.T.
3001843	3005024	I almost said E.T.
3005044	3005244	though.
3006064	3007004	Footy, you're awesome.
3007124	3008405	You know we think you're awesome.
3008525	3009245	And Toshi too.
3009625	3012585	Alright, Footy, come on, you gotta get a point.
3013505	3014826	Here you go, two strikes.
3014966	3015726	Best Atari 2600 game ever.
3019056	3019496	You know what?
3019556	3022418	I'm going to follow my fellow Spanish-speaking person.
3022698	3023679	I'm going to go with Adventure.
3024440	3025240	Adventure.
3025420	3026721	Show me Adventure.
3027382	3029083	Yes, Adventure is on the board.
3029123	3030724	Bobby Blackwolf said Adventure.
3030784	3031344	There you go.
3031404	3032125	You got a point.
3032885	3033385	All right.
3034246	3035567	And you still have two strikes.
3035607	3036468	Try to get some more points.
3037328	3038349	Oh, okay.
3040170	3041791	So I have, what, six more people?
3042091	3044513	Six more people, six more answers.
3045594	3046094	Oh, my God.
3047404	3047685	and DarkSakura.
3067590	3067911	You know what?
3067951	3070752	I can't remember name games for the 3600.
3071893	3073755	I'm going to say Galaga.
3073775	3075636	I don't even know if that was in the 3600.
3075956	3076196	All right.
3076216	3077377	At least we got an answer out of you.
3077417	3078458	Jeez, we had to beat it out of you.
3078518	3078778	All right.
3078798	3079218	Here it is.
3080179	3081320	Show me Galaga.
3083480	3084521	Oh, I'm sorry, footy.
3084541	3086142	I don't think Galaga was on it.
3086302	3087103	I hate you.
3087404	3088885	I don't think Galaga was on it, but that's all right.
3089105	3089445	Good guess.
3089726	3091568	All right, Toshin, here it is.
3092068	3093269	It's your chance to steal.
3093329	3095531	Let me tell you what the stakes are here.
3095692	3097653	If you steal the board, you will win.
3098014	3100476	But if you don't steal the board, footy will win.
3101177	3102538	That's what it comes down to right here.
3102638	3103779	So, Toshin.
3104640	3105661	You've thought and you've thought.
3105761	3108702	What would you say is the best Atari 2600 game ever?
3109003	3111064	Man, I already know the answer I should have given.
3112044	3113065	Is your name Toshin?
3113685	3116947	I just remember of a game.
3117207	3118608	Toshin, what's it going to be?
3120615	3120835	Asteroids
3151104	3152164	for the game.
3152765	3154925	Show me asteroids!
3158387	3159467	Oh, I'm sorry.
3159927	3163048	What was the other one you were thinking of?
3164269	3164909	Crazy climber.
3165134	3167977	Crazy Climber was on the Atari 2600, I think.
3167997	3168978	I just thought of Joust for some reason.
3168998	3169919	Let me run down the top answers.
3169939	3170780	You're going to hate me for this one.
3170800	3171681	Rob said Pitfall 2.
3184293	3185374	Oh man, come on.
3185394	3186215	That's unfair.
3186235	3187135	I said Pitfall.
3187155	3187976	Play the games.
3188036	3188797	They're a big difference.
3189277	3190438	Jamie said Kangaroo.
3191318	3192579	Loki said Combat.
3193280	3194901	Shane said Spider-Man.
3195622	3197203	Irene said Missile Command.
3197803	3202046	And DMN said Warlords were the answers that were left on the board.
3202127	3203127	So there you have it.
3203728	3206089	Argentina and Footy Monster wins 5-3.
3208231	3215733	Actdeft has the code, so Actdeft, I'm going to have you send that code over to Footy, because he'll get his right away for actually winning.
3215773	3217634	And Toshin, you'll get yours later.
3218814	3221635	We're actually probably going to give you just Microsoft points so you can buy it, okay?
3235522	3235782	What?
3236682	3237322	What's wrong?
3237562	3238983	You're still getting something, man.
3239303	3240784	I want as much as anybody else right now.
3241244	3243145	You want it anyway, you just gotta wait a little while.
3243325	3244725	Four to six weeks for shipping and handling.
3245085	3245346	Alright.
3246426	3247246	That was fun, actually.
3247927	3248587	That was a fun game.
3248627	3249247	Did you like the game?
3249267	3250108	I didn't know what I was getting into.
3250128	3250828	Yeah, I did.
3250848	3251288	I actually liked it.
3251328	3251868	We'll have to see.
3252189	3252669	Chat room.
3252709	3253510	Did you guys like the game?
3253530	3254571	Should we do it again in the future?
3255091	3255932	I want to see you in the chat.
3256232	3256512	All right.
3257713	3264358	Well, thank you guys very much for playing and subjecting yourself to the OLR Family Feud featuring the crappy soundboard.
3265239	3266780	Good job.
3268962	3269382	All right.
3271997	3274819	Alright guys, we're going to hang up on you and have a good night, okay?
3275699	3276380	Alright, thank you guys.
3276400	3277080	Alright, bye-bye.
3277220	3281543	And Footy, let me know if Actdeft doesn't get you the code because I have it somewhere, but I'm sure he'll send it to you, okay?
3282644	3285686	He just sent me a message asking for my email, so I'm guessing we're in the works.
3286026	3286506	Wonderful.
3286566	3287147	Alright, have a good one.
3287707	3288888	And Toshin, I'll be in touch with you.
3289028	3289588	Alright, bye-bye.
3291910	3292410	Alright.
3293191	3293971	Did you guys like the game?
3294752	3295832	It went on for like 20 minutes.
3296012	3296733	It was cool.
3296753	3297233	It was kind of fun.
3297253	3298034	A little different.
3298814	3299074	Alright.
3299995	3300395	Let's see.
3301096	3301196	Uh...
3302608	3311809	I like the concept but it's a horrible game you can't get anyone's answers the group being surveyed is way too difficult to predict it's funny to hear their answers but you're impossible to guess them
3313443	3315886	Like that's any better than the match game?
3316307	3316647	We'll see.
3316667	3318569	Yeah, I know.
3318629	3322293	We'll try a version where we survey the entire chat room before the show.
3322433	3322794	We'll see.
3322874	3324716	But then the chatters know what's coming.
3324756	3325417	That's the problem.
3325497	3326918	That's why we didn't do it that way this time.
3326978	3328300	Because then they know what questions are coming.
3328440	3329601	No, I just see you.
3329842	3331383	This is fine the way it was.
3331784	3332084	We'll see.
3332384	3334046	They can quit their bitching.
3334287	3334487	Alright.
3336647	3339169	Alright, we'll see what happens with that in the future.
3339189	3341370	In the meantime, we've got to go back to some more news.
3341730	3346713	We've got more gaming news, just a little bit, and then we're going to open the Skype line for you guys to give us a call with your own thoughts.
3346753	3347373	And set it on fire.
3347954	3349514	Yes, and then we'll set the Skype line on fire.
3349534	3351095	Fuego!
3351255	3355058	Alright, and any excuse for me to play the Pac-Man noise again will be welcomed.
3355518	3356278	Alright, next story, please.
3356779	3357919	Ninja Gaiden 2.
3359080	3360721	If you pre-order it, you get stuff.
3362165	3362505	The end.
3362825	3363106	I'm kidding.
3378078	3380158	lets you look like the bad guys that you're facing.
3380198	3384239	It's basically a nice big costume for Ryu.
3385980	3398842	However, if you are of the more patient variety, you can download a costume pack of three in July, which will be 200 Microsoft points.
3398882	3405944	Ninja Gaiden 2 will be out in Europe on the 6th of June, so you can test out how fun it is then.
3408280	3408760	All right.
3410001	3410402	Yay.
3410782	3411643	Yay, indeed.
3411783	3412283	Stuff.
3413184	3413524	All right.
3413584	3414245	I like stuff.
3414685	3419609	I just don't like having to pre-order games because then a better deal will come out the day the game comes out.
3420290	3421691	Yeah.
3422031	3425974	Well, there's going to be hopefully some interesting news coming very soon.
3426595	3437264	Apparently Microsoft is having a PR event next week where they're going to supposedly debut the new Xbox 360 motion controller.
3438044	3441405	and, of course, we talked about it last week, their partnership with Gyration.
3443005	3448406	Also, the other things that they're going to be unveiling, and I know this is probably going to happen, is Banjo-Kazooie 3.
3448467	3451527	In fact, there's been some screenshots that have already come out for that.
3452107	3457109	So, it's going to be interesting to see what goes on.
3457429	3460649	And this is during the Game Critics Awards, I guess.
3461810	3466351	That's supposed to happen next week, so... I don't know.
3466931	3467211	We'll see.
3468581	3468942	You know what?
3469082	3471243	Actually, a good idea came to us.
3471763	3473784	Can I read this aloud for the Family Feud?
3474985	3475425	I guess so.
3475565	3475725	Sure.
3476025	3477066	I think this is a good idea.
3477706	3482129	We could survey the chatroom for Family Feud and have people in studio play.
3482429	3484090	Like when we have some of our guests here.
3484130	3487031	We could get Rice Princess and Mo to battle each other.
3487091	3490233	We could get Nathan and Nextifer or something.
3490413	3492594	Get some guests on the show to battle each other.
3492614	3493375	That might be kind of fun.
3494537	3495237	That might be a way to do it.
3495257	3498219	Since we're dealing with some good access to the chatroom.
3498259	3498459	Exactly.
3498479	3499279	Then it would be a secret.
3499620	3500220	I like that idea.
3500740	3502281	We have to make them face like us.
3502501	3502861	We'll see.
3503201	3503742	A panel of us.
3503762	3505262	Then it's chatroom feud at that point.
3505322	3506443	Maybe that's what we'll rename it to.
3506603	3507283	The chatroom feud.
3507804	3508204	All right.
3508404	3509044	Anyhow, sorry.
3509064	3511786	I didn't mean to derail from the topic of the games.
3511926	3512406	Yes, you did.
3512546	3513306	Yeah, I did a little bit.
3513586	3514167	But, I mean...
3515586	3517947	How much of a wee ripoff is this going to be, if at all?
3517987	3520767	Or do you think they are going a totally different direction with this?
3520928	3521948	It depends what they do with it.
3522108	3533071	I think if it's going to be like the other Q-Motion stuff, which is essentially you buy something that looks like a bowling ball, something that looks like a golf club and something like that.
3533698	3535599	I don't know how popular that's going to be.
3535779	3541080	It'll be nifty, but it's not going to be something that I think you'd have to go run out right away and buy.
3541981	3548883	And also, I would like to see them come up with something a little bit more universal so you're not buying this huge peripheral for one game.
3549343	3551283	Because I'd be kind of retarded.
3552024	3553064	But, I don't know.
3553084	3554544	We'll have to see what they come up with.
3554744	3562407	I think it's going to be hard for them not to be kind of accused of ripping off Nintendo.
3562447	3562647	So...
3563868	3568670	Because even Sony was accused of ripping off Nintendo when that 6-axis was thrown in at the last minute, remember that?
3568970	3571550	And that wasn't even really the same thing, you know what I mean?
3572151	3576712	But still, though, it's just like, oh, now it has motion-sensitive stuff.
3578153	3580613	And really, what did that pan out to?
3580633	3584294	I mean, hardly any games use it, so... I don't know.
3585575	3585855	Alright.
3587251	3595795	Anyhow, we got one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to be getting to the Skype line here very shortly, but this next story requires some music.
3599317	3600157	And you know what that means.
3600197	3604039	Somebody earned themselves a stupid award this week in some horrific...
3605485	3610690	The person who wins the Stupid Award on OLR this week is Edward Stoddard!
3610730	3612031	Congratulations!
3612391	3615434	He was arrested in Dade City, and you know what he did?
3616175	3619678	He murdered his neighbor over a missing PlayStation 3.
3619758	3627725	That's right, he murdered Douglas Abrams because they were arguing over the PlayStation 3 on April 24th.
3629853	3638039	No really word on what it was that they were specifically arguing about, but it just kind of begs the question, is a PlayStation 3 really worth killing someone over?
3639780	3640441	That's what I want to know.
3640461	3642963	You could have been playing Grand Theft Auto 4 on said PlayStation 3.
3644858	3650082	But it just goes to show, you know, regardless, you know, obviously this guy obviously has issues.
3650142	3652103	He needs to play Wii Ethics.
3652904	3656046	Is it appropriate to kill someone over a missing video game console?
3656126	3656786	Yes or no?
3656827	3659869	And if you say yes, then the console spits acid at you or something.
3659889	3660149	I don't know.
3660569	3662250	But, wait, that's not good.
3662591	3664572	That's awesome.
3664632	3665353	Wrong!
3665573	3666213	Wrong answer.
3666293	3666674	Die.
3666994	3668695	You need to be erased from humanity.
3668715	3669435	Get out of the gene pool.
3669455	3669556	What?
3669576	3669656	What?
3673158	3680740	instead of it being highly corrosive acid, it should be minorly corrosive acid so that they're left with chemical burns and you all know that they scored wrong.
3681680	3681941	Ew.
3682801	3683541	I think that would be great.
3683561	3684621	You've got issues.
3684841	3686442	No, no, because it wouldn't kill them.
3686962	3690243	It'd just maim them a little and everyone would know that they're stupid.
3691024	3691284	All right.
3692125	3695427	Anyway, stupid award stories usually make me a little bit angsty.
3695647	3697688	And also the fact that I forgot to put it anywhere else.
3697708	3698949	Yeah, I was about to mention that.
3698989	3700790	I was like, come on.
3701170	3701530	That's all right.
3701550	3701970	I caught it.
3702070	3702391	I caught it.
3702411	3703191	Whew, saved myself.
3703811	3704712	Yeah, CFU's of the week.
3720174	3725858	My FU of the week, now I told Rob what it was on Friday, but I've decided to expand it a little bit.
3726718	3736445	And my FU of the week is to people who buy into what they're told without researching it first.
3737631	3742213	And my primary example was the practice of circumcising little boys.
3742853	3744034	Ow, crossing legs.
3745034	3756260	Because I understand that for religious purposes it's part of your culture, but for purpose of aesthetics or thinking that it's healthy, no, it's not.
3756460	3763743	And actually it ends up being very traumatic and also makes getting the nookie a lot less satisfying.
3764944	3765784	This has been proven wrong.
3766224	3783637	So also, in the same tone then, it goes to people who think that just because Specialist A has said, oh, this is not what you want to do, that suddenly it's law.
3783858	3787661	And I'm not going to go into specifics on that in particular, but there's...
3790262	3792743	Okay, actually, I'm going to sort of go into specifics on this one.
3792763	3793403	That's alright.
3793943	3811648	There being some sort of widespread rumor that if you were a massage therapist, then you were suddenly in adult entertainment, and this is why I get really pissed off at the whole happy ending bullshit, because of people who think that, and those jokes that go around.
3811988	3814288	I haven't been able to get my business license for six months.
3816129	3816969	So... Don't.
3818021	3828734	I'm very, very, very angry about that, but they've revamped the requirements for it in my town and made it to where I can get my license again.
3829776	3832359	It also goes towards people who, you know...
3833821	3854740	It's really just a bunch of what we think, a bunch of what we accept as fact in our daily lives is really, in most cases, the result of sensationalism and people trying to tell us what they want us to think so that we'll spend money in said area, so that more money will go into the pockets of people who
3856351	3859894	FDU Driving to and from Oakland It's long and boring
3878072	3878632	and it's Oakland.
3879032	3880813	Is that it?
3880833	3884094	Yeah, it's a long drive and you're like, oh, yay, Oakland.
3886215	3888456	There's a yummy Indian food place in Oakland I ate at once.
3889516	3896818	Speaking of food, F you to the news I got this week that due to my pancreatitis I had back in April when I was in the hospital for a few days.
3897919	3903040	F you to the fact that I will be stuck on a low-fat diet for two more months, which means no Indian food.
3903060	3907402	Well, I guess there's some Indian food dishes I can have, but no garlic naan or the stuff I really like
3907802	3909543	for two more months at least.
3909603	3913224	And the fact that that means I can't have cake or ice cream on my 30th birthday, that kind of blows.
3913944	3916625	But at least I'd rather be eating low fat than be dead.
3917225	3917906	So F you to that.
3917946	3922307	And F you to the fact that on top of dealing with all that, I think I'm getting a cold or something.
3922707	3924968	So F you to being sick twice at the same time.
3925228	3925929	It kind of sucks.
3927329	3928570	I just want this year to go away.
3929550	3930450	The show's been good, though.
3930770	3931691	That's one good thing about it.
3931811	3932391	The show's been great.
3933479	3933759	All right.
3934980	3937801	Hippolytus in chat asks, dude, how much weight has Sky lost?
3938041	3938401	25 pounds.
3938521	3939521	I've lost 25 pounds.
3939621	3941602	I used to have quite a bit of a little bit of a beer gut.
3941622	3942943	Now I have a tiny little beer gut.
3943743	3947324	And I'm going to be starting to work out soon because I'm starting to feel a lot better, like my chest and everything.
3947724	3952146	So it's going to be – I'm going to have abs by the time all is said and done.
3952646	3953087	We'll see.
3953867	3954687	At least that's the goal.
3956148	3956528	All right.
3958989	3961950	Let's move on to the Skype line.
3963370	3965351	We're going to be taking some calls on the Skype line.
3967833	3972716	You can call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3972736	3977398	We don't have time for a lot of calls tonight, but we'll definitely try to get some calls in.
3977679	3978799	So you can call us right now.
3978899	3981401	While we wait for some calls, do you have a quick last minute story for us, Matt?
3982105	3984289	Yeah, Prototype's been delayed to 2009.
3984789	3985431	What's Prototype?
3985771	3989337	It was this game that was like Crackdown, but you're like a mutant and can do crazy shit.
3989737	3990198	Jump around.
3990559	3991420	Big sandbox game.
3991440	3992161	Interesting.
3992181	3993143	It's supposed to come out this fall.
3993163	3993584	2009 now.
3995407	3996047	Well, that's too bad.
3996407	3996647	Yeah.
3997067	3997427	Anything else?
3998108	4003089	Killzone 2 was officially announced for February 2009, so that's pretty awesome.
4003229	4007210	I think Resistance is still coming out this fall, so I think we have that to look forward to.
4007250	4009010	But Killzone 2, pretty cool.
4009590	4013711	There was some footage online for that, but apparently it got yanked because it wasn't supposed to be out yet.
4014951	4015452	Oh, well.
4015472	4016752	That sucks.
4017412	4018712	Let's go to ZPhones.
4019513	4020913	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4020953	4021313	Who's this?
4024275	4026037	Oh my god, it's Clicky the pen.
4026317	4029001	Clicky, who gave you access to a telephone?
4029962	4033546	Clicky, what are you doing?
4033746	4034947	I'm sorry, Sky.
4035047	4036629	He must have butt-dialed you guys or something.
4036669	4037590	I don't know.
4038291	4038732	It's Bobby.
4038832	4040454	Was Clicky trying to flirt with the ferret?
4040494	4041275	I think that's what it was.
4042176	4043537	I think he's demanding ransom.
4043717	4044999	I think he knows where the ferret is.
4046378	4047739	Clicky Kidnapped the Ferret
4061946	4080050	I know you talked, it's always funny because you do the show that's on right before us on allgames.com at 5 o'clock Pacific, and you were talking about the whole DRM, Digital Rights Management thing, which I read about earlier this week, and I was like, I want to talk about it this week on Orange Lounge Radio, and then it didn't even make it in our show roll because I forgot.
4080070	4082591	And it wasn't supposed to be worth talking about.
4083371	4083611	All right.
4084252	4088794	Well, Loki, sum up what happened real quick because I want to get Bobby's opinion on this and our other opinions.
4089254	4100300	Originally, EA came up with this wonderful idea that both Mass Effect and Spore were going to be validated via, I guess, an online call-home thing every 10 days.
4100861	4103742	And if it didn't do that, it wouldn't work anymore.
4104022	4104383	So...
4106104	4106564	That sucked.
4106624	4111306	But then they came out and decided, hey, we're not going to do that because people don't like that kind of thing.
4111766	4117089	So now Mass Effect is going to authenticate itself when you first install it.
4117449	4121411	And then if you download any additional download content, it will redo that as well.
4121711	4122512	Same with Spore.
4122552	4126674	Spore, once you install it, and also if you connect to online.
4129221	4131107	So, Bobby, what are your thoughts on this?
4131448	4136444	I don't want to spoil your whole show because I know you go into it on your show, but quickly, what were kind of your thoughts on this issue?
4137520	4142861	Well, my thing was more because they're trying to market Spore because Will Wright was on the Colbert Report.
4142901	4144782	He's been doing the late-night talk show rounds.
4145242	4155424	They're trying to market Spore to a larger audience than just gamers, and not every person who has a computer actually has Internet access from their home.
4155464	4159305	Either they use it for work or they go to a public library or something.
4159505	4163146	They may have a decent computer, but it may not necessarily be online.
4163906	4173735	and so even that one-time activation may be a problem for some people because they're used to just getting this DVD or CD and sticking it in their computer and playing and now you can't do that.
4173815	4175276	Now you have to have this other charge.
4175676	4178399	You have to have internet service from your home just to play it.
4179099	4204452	and the reason that they got rid of the 10 day phoning home every 10 days was actually because of the US Armed Forces they can't guarantee an internet connection when they're overseas but they still play games on their PC they do have down time to get their mind off of what they're doing and I think that's why they got rid of the 10 day restriction but there's still that first time and then any other time when you're online then it will check but it's not going to force you but I think it still leaves out a segment of the population that doesn't have internet at home
4205270	4215773	Well, I would think, especially in the case of the armed forces who are doing a big job that not a lot of people want to do for this country, I would hope that EA would come up with a way that they can bypass it.
4215794	4218574	At least the armed forces can get a special version of the game or something.
4218935	4223336	Now, granted... If there was a special version of the game that the armed forces got, it would be on the internet.
4223776	4226839	Yeah, I guess that's the unfortunate side of that is it would happen.
4226879	4230042	But somehow, like I don't know, there's got to be something that they could do.
4230102	4232004	Even with this, I think it's going to be broken.
4232164	4232804	It doesn't matter.
4233205	4235086	Everybody finds a way to get past everything.
4235527	4236448	That's true.
4236508	4238089	Didn't Bioshock do something similar?
4238890	4240691	Yeah, but people found ways around that.
4240751	4245215	Yeah, people – like it would only let you install it on so many computers and it had to connect to the internet each time.
4245576	4247718	And then once it hit its limit, too bad, so sad.
4248598	4249139	I guess, yeah.
4249339	4250040	Yeah, something like that.
4251204	4274684	Frisbee points out in chatroom the portal retail version requires online to start up which is well I don't know because I bought it on Steam and Steam does all that copy protection stuff you know kind of as part of I think you have to have Steam when you buy the retail version oh that's right that's right I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago not that I know or anything but they found a way around that you heard I heard yeah okay
4276980	4278921	Is that from your independent research that you did?
4279061	4282703	I own the Orange Box on Xbox 360.
4282783	4284664	I just wanted to see what it looked like on my PC.
4287185	4287505	Alright.
4287805	4290106	Bobby, anything else you wanted to share with our listeners tonight?
4291127	4293708	No, that was it.
4293728	4294448	Wait a minute.
4294628	4295809	Clicky, don't come back.
4295889	4297030	Don't talk about the ferret.
4297110	4297470	Clicky.
4299279	4300279	That's not nice, Clicky.
4300939	4303760	Yeah, I know they've got an explicit tag, Clicky, but go away.
4303860	4304780	Sorry about that, Rob.
4305100	4306141	No, that's quite okay.
4306161	4311042	You know, I'm thinking maybe Clicky and the Ferret could get their own show that no one would listen to.
4311762	4312302	No one.
4313462	4314242	Except maybe Jamie.
4316943	4318123	She's making pouty face at me.
4318703	4319483	All right, bye, Bobby.
4319523	4320024	Bye, Clicky.
4321124	4321684	Bye, Rob.
4322244	4322884	Go away, Clicky.
4325545	4325885	All right.
4326823	4329204	Blackboy in chat says, I would totally listen to that show.
4329284	4330004	So there you have it.
4331285	4333326	What exactly would Clicky and the Ferret talk about?
4333626	4335527	What do pens and ferrets have in common?
4336327	4336847	I'm not sure.
4337748	4338308	They're long.
4338868	4339308	That's true.
4339829	4340869	All right, let's go to the phones.
4340929	4341569	We got more calls.
4341609	4342630	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4342650	4343010	Who's this?
4344690	4345571	Yeah, he did a way better job than me.
4345591	4346631	Definitely.
4346831	4348092	I hope that he can win.
4371607	4374209	We still appreciate the effort and are feeling the love very much.
4374269	4375750	To what do we owe this call tonight, Actdeft?
4378372	4382674	Well, basically, I was going to congratulate Matt for winning.
4383515	4395363	And like I said, I hope that he gets all our, how do you say it, support for him to win the oldgames.com contest overall.
4397361	4405125	Though I hope he gives the console to Loki because I was going to do that if I won.
4406486	4407827	Oh, Actdeft was serious.
4407867	4410068	He was going to give you the console if you won.
4410108	4413569	And I would not have let him do that because that's a foolish thing to do.
4413589	4414670	I would have made him keep it.
4414710	4415691	Not a foolish thing to do.
4415771	4424115	I would have been watching your mailbox and when I see this big box coming from Mexico, I would have written died and sent it back.
4424615	4425395	Expired.
4427096	4428157	That doesn't work, by the way.
4429437	4430618	Have you tried doing that to Junkmail?
4430678	4431698	I've tried that with Junkmail.
4432739	4433359	Deceased.
4433679	4434600	No, they don't believe it.
4434620	4439442	They're like, oh, hey, well, someone was there to write deceased on it, so therefore.
4440263	4440763	More junk.
4441663	4442884	Is that all you wanted to say, Actdeft?
4443404	4445005	Anything going on in your gaming world this week?
4447141	4449622	Basically, it's pretty much that.
4449682	4451102	I haven't been gaming that much.
4451162	4454583	I have been working and other stuff.
4454943	4458664	But I'm pretty looking forward to Space Invaders Extreme.
4459204	4460464	Oh yes, me too.
4461504	4465445	I have seen some of the videos and oh my god, that's awesome.
4465765	4466665	It's an awesome game.
4468006	4468966	It reminds me of F.R.E.S.S.
4469666	4472828	I played it for about three minutes, and it was an awesome three minutes.
4473048	4474809	I definitely am going to pick this game up on my PSP.
4475249	4477130	It's got a great soundtrack.
4477410	4478311	It is on the DS, too.
4478631	4481592	I think I'm going to get it on PSP, just for the heck of it.
4481672	4483333	And it's going to be pretty cheap, also.
4483353	4486175	It's like $20 on GameStop.
4486375	4488476	Yeah, I think it's $20.
4488776	4490177	It's cheap, and I think it'll be good.
4490917	4495440	We'll review the game in full a little later on, as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it.
4496560	4497841	We'll be looking forward to it.
4498448	4503313	Actdeft, take a break from making radio ads this week and definitely play some more games if you can.
4503773	4508577	And we're going to need your help so that we can get SSJ100Matt to win the contest at all games.
4508637	4511860	So as soon as I know how he can do that, we'll fill you in.
4513322	4513582	Okay.
4513802	4514122	All right.
4514703	4514963	Thanks.
4515103	4515323	All right.
4515343	4515824	Take care, buddy.
4518031	4525616	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Meanwhile, do we have any other last minute stories?
4526416	4529518	Oh wait, no, just kidding, we have another call Hi, Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4530479	4533600	Hey, it's DJ Tyrant Hey, DJ Tyrant, how are you doing?
4534341	4541325	Good That was a fun Mario Kart match last night, by the way I don't remember most of it Why not?
4541405	4542926	Do you not remember me kicking your ass?
4543446	4546068	I was a little drinky, drinky
4546630	4549431	You were drunk playing Mario Kart online?
4549511	4552133	Yeah, I had just gotten home, and I'm like, what am I going to do?
4552213	4553253	I don't want to go to sleep yet.
4553473	4558276	So I popped in Mario Kart, and I was able to navigate the menus perfectly fine.
4558596	4561137	But once I got in the game, it was all downhill from there.
4561457	4564399	No wonder you kept coming in last.
4564639	4568081	Now, did you know that we actually were broadcasting that whole thing on Justin.TV?
4568101	4568501	No.
4568661	4569762	I had no idea.
4595843	4599424	So I went in there, logged into Mario Kart, and it was like me, Ranma, and then DarkTetsuya.
4599664	4600804	And then you joined out of nowhere.
4600824	4603425	I was like, oh, Jimmy must have saw us on just the TV.
4603445	4604185	That is so funny.
4604225	4605765	So you were drinking.
4605805	4612547	Yeah, when you connect to Wi-Fi, if there's like one of your friends with an open room, it has like a smiley face next to friends.
4613727	4615528	Oh, I didn't know that.
4615628	4616488	Okay, that's helpful.
4616548	4617988	Wow, what a good case of timing, though.
4618228	4619909	But shame on you for drinking and driving.
4620609	4620930	I know.
4621270	4624855	But I guess if you're gonna do it, then you gotta do it in Mario Kart.
4624875	4626537	I guess that's the safest place to drink and drive.
4626878	4627358	Exactly.
4627919	4628219	Nice.
4629421	4629802	Awesome.
4629862	4630122	Or GTA 4.
4630162	4630302	Huh?
4632133	4656905	Or GTA 4 So that's why you picked Rainbow Road, because I was like, oh god No, I hit random, I did not want to play Rainbow Road, I hate that level so much Oh, okay, okay, alright, because I was cursing you out when you picked it I could tell, everyone was hating me at that point, and if there was voice chat it wouldn't have been very pretty Yeah, maybe that's why Nintendo banned voice chat, so it spares us from a drunken gym Anything, did you call in to talk about something else tonight, Jimmy?
4656945	4658646	I totally derailed it to Mario Kart No, that was it
4658866	4659507	Oh, okay.
4659627	4661948	You were calling to make excuses for your drunken performance last night.
4662388	4662569	Yep.
4662729	4663289	Alright, that's fine.
4664310	4666151	We'll have to play a sober match sometime.
4666191	4671795	Maybe you can represent the OLR crew when we do our big epic battle with Bobby Blackwolf later.
4672215	4672415	Okay.
4672676	4672916	Alright.
4673316	4673856	Take care, Jimmy.
4674537	4675658	Hey, thanks for getting me on the show.
4675778	4676198	No problem.
4676238	4676518	Bye.
4677939	4684824	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight because we went really long with the match game thing and we want to try to end it at an east hour tonight.
4684864	4687706	So, Loki, please finish up any other last minute stories you might have tonight.
4688308	4690209	Okay, let's see here.
4690369	4694292	Well, first off, let's talk real quick.
4694732	4696593	We mentioned a lot of stuff about Rock Band earlier.
4696934	4701196	Apparently, well, first off, they've got some new stuff coming out this week.
4701216	4706980	Of course, Hanging on Telephone by Blondie, Train in Vain by The Clash, and Cool Thing by Sonic Youth.
4707000	4707861	So that's pretty awesome.
4707901	4709582	All going to be $2 or 160 Microsoft points.
4709782	4709882	Okay.
4713598	4716839	There's also some, I guess, tracks on sale.
4717920	4723282	All sorts of stuff between, I guess, now and June 2nd.
4724983	4729105	I guess two per week are going to be half price, or 80 Microsoft points.
4729785	4737468	So, I guess, this week there was Crush Crush Crush by Paramore and Boston's rock and roll band.
4738029	4738289	I guess...
4740430	4748593	Later this week, there was Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia and Faith No More's We Care A Lot and Leonard Skinner's Gimme Three Steps.
4749293	4753195	And then, I'm not sure what's coming up later.
4753315	4754515	Let me see here real quick.
4757840	4764506	Next week, there's going to be Shockwave, Black Tide, and Sugar Magnolia by Grateful Dead.
4765106	4771232	And then the week after that, we care a lot, I guess, Faith No More and All the Small Things by Blink-182.
4772033	4774055	All the small things.
4774235	4781441	And then finally, I guess, the last week is going to be Gimme Three Steps by Leonard Skinner and Dirty Little Secret by All American Rejects.
4782615	4786879	If you want more information, Major Nelson had a story on it, so you can check that out.
4787560	4787981	Half price.
4789122	4790683	And Activision during their...
4791954	4793015	I guess we'll have to see.
4821203	4827027	This week also, there's a ton of demos being released on Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.
4827127	4828628	Born Conspiracy is on there.
4828708	4830008	Haze on the PlayStation 3.
4831289	4832770	Grid, which you've got to check out.
4832830	4833791	Awesome racing game.
4833811	4834731	That's on both.
4835471	4842816	And next week, or actually a few weeks from now, June 5th, there's going to be Battlefield Bad Company in case you didn't get into the beta.
4844237	4852348	New Xbox Live Arcade game coming in June, Vigilante 8 Arcade, which, you know, Vigilante 8 is a fucking awesome game.
4853249	4854991	It's also going to have download content.
4855151	4858996	No word when in June it's coming, but at least have the month nailed down.
4860416	4867560	Grand Turismo has shipped 50 million units total for the entire franchise, and that's globally.
4867900	4868941	So that's pretty awesome.
4871402	4872163	Let's see here.
4872763	4873723	This sounds pretty cool.
4873883	4879767	I played a little bit of Namco X Capcom, or Cross Capcom.
4880447	4881087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4905174	4906315	All sorts of stuff.
4906335	4911438	And this is coming from Famitsu Magazine, which has some nifty screenshots for that.
4911558	4915000	Looks like Morgan's in there, and Etna?
4916720	4917681	I'm not sure who else.
4918441	4922264	Oh, Donovan, and looks like... Who else?
4922504	4923464	Huh.
4923504	4924165	Lots of people, though.
4924365	4925045	Looks pretty awesome.
4925145	4927146	I like AJ Mix's idea for a game in chat.
4927226	4928247	Everyone cross everyone.
4929261	4929681	I like that.
4930622	4930802	Me too.
4931942	4932802	Now this is kind of neat.
4932922	4937324	And remember, I think a few weeks ago when we were trying to show off Crisis Core, it really pissed me off.
4937884	4942006	But thank God for the homebrew community.
4942166	4948789	On the PSP, there is a new homebrew update called the FUSA Build 032.
4949569	4958153	What it does is allows people with custom firmwares to use the video out and use any sort of core they want.
4958233	4958833	So whether it be
4958933	4959513	Hooray!
4959533	4962956	Composite, Component, S-Video, or D-Terminal.
4963596	4970921	They can use it on their TV play games, and they have a whole bunch of other options for that.
4971982	4976665	Something that should have been done anyways in a firmware update, I think, but whatever.
4978727	4979687	And let's see here.
4980908	4983490	We've got one more thing here.
4984191	4986012	There's a... This is kind of funny.
4986412	4987012	There's a...
4988922	4992145	I guess it's a gaming device called Bob that's being released.
4992685	5003535	And what it is, is it's a way for parents, they would hook it up to a console of their choice, and they can set time limits for the amount of games that kids can play.
5004355	5011362	So it kind of looks like a giant calculator, and it will shut the power off after a certain amount of time.
5012162	5013063	And it's password protected.
5013083	5013884	Okay.
5014781	5015742	So it's kind of neat.
5016162	5018363	And then finally, I have to show this to you, Rob.
5018523	5024247	They're going to release this on cell phone games from Gameloft.
5024387	5026348	They're remaking The Oregon Trail.
5026949	5027369	Nice.
5027789	5029210	And it's done all fancy.
5029470	5032012	And I can totally see this coming to the DS at some point.
5033400	5036401	Wow, it looks like Oregon Trail does battle.
5036441	5037561	That's kind of weird looking.
5037841	5038061	Yeah.
5038261	5038781	Interesting.
5038821	5041282	All fancy like, but yeah, you can check it out.
5041322	5041802	They had a preview.
5041822	5046363	Hey, look, as long as I can make a character named Jamie and she dies of cholera.
5047803	5048144	Heart.
5049824	5050804	But that is it.
5052004	5052325	All right.
5052825	5055605	Hey, at least it wasn't dysentery because dysentery is so cliche.
5057466	5057786	All right.
5058586	5059046	Anyhow.
5059666	5062147	That is why I hope I catch malaria.
5063200	5065542	And I don't know, Jamie, you should check this out on Kotaku.
5065562	5067804	They have the ultimate horse riding simulation.
5067844	5069825	I just thought of Final Furlong when I saw it.
5070185	5071346	It looks like an actual horse.
5072327	5073288	Hump a horse, the game.
5073308	5073748	Yeehaw.
5073788	5075449	And the person's even dressed up.
5076030	5076630	Like a jockey?
5076710	5077231	Like a horse?
5077831	5078051	No.
5079152	5080113	A horse riding a horse.
5080173	5081694	Oh my god, a horse riding a horse.
5082735	5084736	But a horse is a horse, of course, of course.
5085517	5085837	Alright.
5086838	5088279	Horse riding horse?
5088379	5089120	How can that be?
5089810	5092472	That's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
5092512	5095774	But first, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5095834	5097035	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5097895	5099456	Reject false icons.
5099696	5100977	But I have an addition to that now.
5101838	5103579	Think with your brain, not the TV guide.
5105120	5107401	My final thought is reject the common cold.
5108142	5108422	Loki.
5110094	5113979	I need to play more ranked Grand Theft Auto 4 multiplayer.
5114740	5121049	Oh, and sorry for people that see me online around 10 o'clock and 3 o'clock Pacific time.
5121590	5123133	Yeah, because we do our online...
5124221	5130026	inter-employee games and accidentally invited people sometimes to that and I had to kick them.
5130986	5133008	Sorry, Jason51.
5133768	5135470	Anyways, that's what's going on there.
5135810	5136130	Alright.
5136450	5139132	So 10am and 3pm, not good GTA times for Loki.
5139153	5139733	Yeah, noon though.
5139953	5141775	Sometimes we'll leave it open during noon.
5142075	5142335	Alright.
5143610	5147053	Alright, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
5147713	5152057	My name is Rob Roberts, that's DarkSakura, that's Loki, and we're out of here for a week.
