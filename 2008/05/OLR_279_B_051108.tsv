0	6140	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast on May 11, 2008.
6140	12480	It's Mother's Day, so if you forgot, you definitely owe your mother like a big bouquet of flowers.
12480	17560	So you should definitely call her if you haven't already, or, you know, whatever motherly figure
17560	20880	is in your life because, you know, some single parents and so on.
20880	23800	Not everybody necessarily has a mom, but call somebody and tell them you love them.
23800	24800	Damn it.
24800	25800	Love is in the air.
25800	29000	Myself, DarkSakuraLoki here with you on Orange Lounge Radio part B. We're about to get back
29000	33080	to some news, but first, we have some business to take care of.
33080	39640	We have to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Grand Theft Auto IV contest,
39640	46320	which we're working with AllGames.com to give away a limited edition Xbox 360 Elite Grand
46320	48440	Theft Auto IV system.
48440	52560	It's only like one of eight that have been made, and we have picked our finalists tonight
52560	57320	that will compete against all of the other finalists from all the other all-game shows,
57320	61440	such as, you know, Video Game Outsiders and All Games Interactive and Bobby Black Wolf
61440	62440	and so on.
62440	66000	They have all picked their finalists, and they will all do battle for that console.
66000	71720	But just for qualifying, they've won a $25 gift certificate to the all-game store and
71720	72720	a t-shirt.
72720	74560	So enough suspense.
74560	79600	Let's play the winner for you guys one more time, the winner of the Grand Theft Auto IV
79600	83640	contest on Orange Lounge Radio SSJ 100, Matt.
83640	89000	From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs. Furries and Orange Lounge Revolution comes
89000	95120	Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix.
95120	96120	That's right.
96120	100800	The highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMania
100800	105560	is back and with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-fisting, ocean-pissing new songs danced
105560	106560	in.
106560	110840	You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite
110840	131520	Orange Lounge Radio hosts, like Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura, please note there are no real
131520	134960	songs sung by Dark Sakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lounge Revolution
134960	138280	team being physically castrated, dying in a bow fire on an ocean of piss while being
138280	140960	incinerated by an underwater volcano, sorry.
140960	159280	You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan, John D. M. N. Bressler, and a ton of licensed
159280	164200	music inspired by the show that the RIAA and North Steel UT don't want you to hear.
164200	168400	The gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer and you might
168400	169560	as well just offer torrents on the website.
169560	173040	So come and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix.
173040	176880	When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplayed.com.
176880	181680	It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied
181680	187720	head while on top of a couple, having sex, shouting, fuck, but I pooped from there, and
187720	189880	it's only from the Nintendo Wii.
189880	194040	So come on down to your local participating Liberty City game store, split a work or breach,
194040	197840	bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix.
197840	201000	If you do, Loki might dress up as Tingle.
201000	202880	Not a guarantee.
202880	208240	See, he says at the end there, not guaranteed, Loki, that you will in fact dress up as Tingle.
208240	210960	It's still implying, though, that it was sales of...
210960	211960	Yeah.
211960	212960	All right, so there it is.
212960	217200	Congrats, SSJ100, Matt, but a big round of applause, everybody, please, to our finalists.
217200	221600	They were all very good, and everybody that participated, we couldn't play them all in
221600	222600	the final round.
222600	223600	I get two claps.
223600	224600	That's all you got for your mouth.
224600	225600	All right.
225600	226600	Thank you.
226600	227600	Now, here's the thing, though.
227600	232040	Now we have to all throw our support behind SSJ100, Matt, as he moves into the final round,
232040	235880	because I'll tell you what, because it's a bunch of OLR in-jokes, you know when they
235880	239200	play that on All Games Interactive or however they decide to do the final, there's a lot
239200	243080	of people that are going to listen to that and go, what the hell is that?
243080	244720	Like, I don't get it.
244720	249200	So we all have to support SSJ100, Matt, now by making sure in the final voting phase,
249200	251620	we all go and vote for him, because we want him to win.
251620	257860	We want to say that the winner came from OLR, so be sure to throw your support behind him
257860	258860	in the finalist round.
258860	262820	We'll give you more information on that next week when the voting should be up.
262820	266480	So check for that on our website as well a little later this week.
266480	267480	All right.
267480	268920	So congrats, SSJ100, Matt.
268920	272660	Another giveaway to come later in the show, that res code finally going to be given away
272660	277880	to somebody, thank God, in a new game coming up a little bit later.
277880	279160	But first, more news.
279160	281080	Loki, let's go back to some gaming news.
281080	287440	I don't want to watch the stock market too much, but I guess if you were hoping that
287440	293440	Tari was going to make a big turnaround and become this really profitable company, well,
293440	294440	no.
294440	301400	In fact, Nasdaq has actually delisted them from the stock exchange, because they have
301400	308240	failed to, well, basically, they failed to submit the year-end financials, and, you know,
308240	311440	before that, the market value was way too low.
311440	317520	They have been dropped, dropped like an American Idol contestant who just couldn't make it.
317520	319840	Or an American Idol contestant's father from backstage.
319840	321080	Did you read about that?
321080	322080	Yes, I did.
322080	323080	Funny stuff.
323080	324080	Oh, wait.
324080	326080	Do we have more in the saga of one of the Davids?
326080	327080	I forget.
327080	329400	I'm not letting this show turn into American Idol chat.
329400	330400	Not, not, not.
330400	334600	Yes, apparently someone's abusive daddy, you know, a la Michael Jackson.
334600	335600	Shut up!
335600	344720	Apparently, there's a certain booboo, if you remember last week, with kind of doing, there's
344720	350480	a cover of a song that he did that, you know, had the lyrics, beautiful girls in it.
350480	351480	That caused him a lot of money.
351480	354480	I hate you guys.
354480	356080	And besides, that was cheap anyways.
356080	360520	That was as cheap as that one chick who was saying all the, like, American Jesus theme
360520	361520	songs.
361520	367680	Anyways, so yes, Atari got delisted from Nasdaq, and, um, yeah.
367680	370960	They're just going down a slippery slope.
370960	376560	Hopefully someone will buy them, and it will be, you know, a little bit more than all Dragon
376560	379960	Ball Z Atari remake games.
379960	386800	Well, we reached out to Atari for comment, and this is all they had to say.
386800	393280	Bad joke.
393280	394280	Nobody's gonna get it.
394280	395280	Alright.
395280	396280	Chirp, chirp.
396280	397280	Take a shot.
397280	399120	Let's go on to some more.
399120	400960	Please tell me somebody got it.
400960	401960	I got it.
401960	402960	Alright.
402960	403960	It just wasn't funny.
403960	404960	Alright.
404960	406960	No, I got it, but, you know, isn't that an Amco game?
406960	407960	No!
407960	410200	It was on the Atari 2016, forget it.
410200	412680	It was on the 2600, but it's an Amco game.
412680	417360	Atari licensed it for the 2600 and then shit all over it, if you remember.
417360	419280	Alright, forget it.
419280	421400	Little Big Planet.
421400	424480	Let's talk about, like, new and exciting games as opposed to games that were out, like, twenty
424480	425480	years ago.
425480	429600	Uh, Little Big Planet will be coming out in October.
429600	433140	This was announced at the PlayStation Day 2008 event in London.
433140	434520	It's from Kazurai himself.
434520	440260	He has confirmed that Little Big Planet's gonna be making its way in October, but one
440260	445960	thing you should be aware of is that, uh, the open beta, not happening.
445960	449440	So if you were looking forward to the public beta that was, like, promised several times
449440	451680	for the game, uh, nope.
451680	452840	The public beta's going away.
452840	453840	So surprised.
453840	458840	You know, a promise broken by Sony, gee.
458840	461880	Hopefully there'll be a demo or something, but don't hold your breath.
461880	462880	You'll probably just have to wait for the game to come out.
462880	465360	Let me just add another check mark on the board there.
465360	466920	Uh, yeah.
466920	467920	Alright.
467920	472480	But Little Big Planet will be making its way in October, um, unless it gets delayed again.
472480	473480	Who never knows.
473480	474480	Who knows?
474480	475920	It'll be all sorts of awesome whenever it comes out.
475920	476920	Alright.
476920	477920	So, moving on.
477920	484720	Well, for things that are to be, uh, coming out, as, uh, mentioned is, uh, Home, which
484720	490680	has been pushed back, pushed back, turned around, upside down, set on fire, and dropped
490680	497720	in, said Underwater Volcano, um, is going to be getting a fall release, which is, uh,
497720	503560	been told to us by SCEED President, uh, David Reeves, and said, he's quoted as saying maybe
503560	508000	we were too ambitious with the non-gaming applications within Home, getting sponsors
508000	509000	and stuff like that.
509000	510000	But don't worry.
510000	512380	You know, in the meantime, Sony has your back.
512380	515680	There is another social engineering game that they have out right now.
515680	517280	It's gonna have a pretty large community.
517280	518640	It's called Go Outside.
518640	522160	But no, it's centralized around large cities.
522160	525760	However, it's not quite as prestigious as, say, Home.
525760	531020	The game is actually homeless, and, um, you can find yourself participating in wonderful
531020	538040	activities like sleeping on a park bench, um, spewing out obscenities, um, talking to
538040	543200	a wall, and, um, just not being cared for.
543200	544720	Okay.
544720	547020	I need to do a quick poll in chat right now.
547020	548020	Quick poll in chat.
548020	549200	All right.
549200	551900	Which joke was funnier?
551900	558160	Loki's homeless joke or Rob's Atari joke?
558160	561080	Place vote now in chat.
561080	562080	In the main chat room.
562080	563080	I think, you know what's funnier?
563080	564080	Which joke was funnier?
564080	565080	You know what's funnier?
565080	566080	Tonight's show.
566080	570080	Tonight's show is hilarious.
570080	571080	Hilarious!
571080	572080	All right.
572080	574080	Loki, go to the next story.
574080	575080	Please.
575080	577080	Oh, wait, wait.
577080	578300	Oh, hold on.
578300	579300	We have the quick poll.
579300	580300	Results are in.
580300	581800	Uh, Rob's Atari joke.
581800	582800	Rob's joke.
582800	583800	Atari.
583800	584800	Rob.
584800	585800	Rob.
585800	586800	Rob's Atari joke.
586800	587800	Rob's.
587800	588800	Rob's Atari joke.
588800	589800	Because Rob used the Atari Pac-Man dying sound.
589800	590800	Rob.
590800	591800	Rob's Atari joke.
591800	592800	Rob.
592800	593800	Rob.
593800	594800	Look at that.
594800	595800	I rock.
595800	596800	Whatever.
596800	597800	Love you, Loki.
597800	598800	Um, so this is a big surprise.
598800	601600	There's rumors now that Daxter and Wipeout Pulse are going to be ported to the PS2.
601600	602600	Really?
602600	604360	PSP games to be imported to the PS2?
604360	605360	That's a first.
605360	612360	So, and this is coming from Juke's Video France, and they were just stating that, of course,
612360	613840	those two games are being ported to the PS2.
613840	619920	I would say that's a pretty safe guess, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it, so.
619920	621400	Not a big surprise.
621400	622960	All right.
622960	626280	So now we've got to downgrade our games to get them to sell more.
626280	627280	Is that basically what this is?
627280	629680	Well, here's the thing, here's the thing, too, is when they port them over, they don't
629680	631560	enhance, like, any of the graphics or anything.
631560	637880	In fact, I believe Ratchet and Clank's size matters didn't look that good on the PS2.
637880	639680	Twisted Metal, pretty cool.
639680	642160	Silent Hill Origins, pretty cool.
642160	644640	But just, I don't know.
644640	648000	Least they could do is, like, upgrade the graphics a little bit.
648000	650240	Yeah, or put them on PS3.
650240	651600	Upgrade, go all the way to PS3.
651600	652600	Why not?
652600	654200	Yeah, who knows.
654200	656320	Oh, we had another comment in the quick poll.
656320	659000	Uh, I would have voted for Loki if he would dress up as Tingle.
659000	660500	Sorry, don't care.
660500	663040	That was from Black Wolf, by the way.
663040	666240	I don't need his sink and vote.
666240	668680	Or his friendship on the PlayStation Network.
668680	670440	Are you going to unfriend Bobby Black Wolf?
670440	673080	Well, that would involve me turning on my PlayStation 3.
673080	675200	That would be a controversy right there.
675200	676640	All right.
676640	677800	Just kidding.
677800	678800	Bobby's awesome.
678800	681240	Here's another game we can try to beat Bobby at in the future.
681240	682360	Bizarre Creations.
682360	684280	They are making a new racing game.
684280	688400	You might remember, they are no longer really involved with Project Gotham Racing.
688400	692760	Microsoft now owns the IP to that, and will be, I guess, developing the inevitable Project
692760	694040	Gotham Racing 5.
694040	699360	Bizarre Creations is making a new franchise that will be, I guess, published by Activision,
699360	702320	and it's coming out in the 2010 fiscal year.
702320	707600	Now that could mean, like, holiday season 09, because the 2010 fiscal year starts April
707600	709480	1st of 2009.
709480	713320	The quote from the conference call earlier this week, Bizarre is deep in development
713320	718120	on two multi-platform titles, and we are looking forward to the release of our first new racing
718120	722440	IP in fiscal 2010, which already looks very strong.
722440	727920	And I just hope, like, I don't know, the thing about Project Gotham for me is that it's a
727920	732200	little heavy on the car shop, you know, and tuning your car and stuff, and I just want
732200	735360	to play, like, a really easy pick-up-and-race type game like F-Zero.
735360	737080	I think that's why I like F-Zero and Mario Kart.
737080	738080	They're really easy.
738080	740160	I want it easy and fast.
740160	743960	That's why I like F-Zero, because you get to drive so fast.
743960	748760	Like I seriously still say F-Zero GX is one of my favorite racing games ever.
748760	751520	This is great.
751520	752520	So.
752520	755760	We'll see, though, what Bizarre has in store for us, because, you know, they might just
755760	762720	try something completely new out of left field that's going to make me go, da-da-da-da, want.
762720	764600	Might you say that, Dark Sakura?
764600	765600	Da-da-da-want.
765600	766600	Ooh.
766600	768600	We'll see.
768600	774520	Well, speaking of stuff that came through via conference call.
774520	775520	How's that for tie-in?
775520	785800	It was actually stated by Activision Publishing CEO Mike Griffith that Guitar Hero has surpassed
785800	789960	15 million in individual song downloads.
789960	796120	So I guess Rock Band's got a little bit more to catch up with, but then again, Guitar Hero
796120	801360	has been out longer, so.
801360	805760	In shorter time, Harmonix hit 10 million.
805760	812760	So I think that, look at it in perspective of time and then see who's doing better.
812760	813760	That's what I say.
813760	815800	I sense a little bit of favoritism on your part.
815800	819880	Especially since Rock Band already had to deal with Guitar Hero's...
819880	820880	Whoa!
820880	821880	Sorry about that.
821880	822880	Okay.
822880	823880	I'm setting up for something later.
823880	825360	Don't pay attention to that.
825360	831520	But since Guitar Hero was already out and already had a loyal fan base when Rock Band
831520	832520	came out.
832520	835900	So to hit 10 million after all that, I think Rock Band's got...
835900	839760	And I'm looking at this just by terms of numbers and time, that I think Rock Band's the more
839760	840760	impressive.
840760	841760	Hmm.
841760	844840	Well, you know, I don't know.
844840	849320	Guitar Hero, I still like it because I think it's more fun to play guitar on Guitar Hero
849320	850320	than it is on Rock Band.
850320	852120	But Rock Band's definitely the better party game.
852120	853920	I like hitting things.
853920	854920	Fuck that shit.
854920	855920	Guitar Freaks.
855920	856920	I don't know who you guys...
856920	857920	No.
857920	858920	Guitar Freaks is kind of...
858920	859920	No!
859920	860920	Guitar Freaks!
860920	861920	No.
861920	862920	Sorry.
862920	863920	Where's your loyalty?
863920	864920	No loyalty.
864920	865920	Sorry.
865920	866920	I defected.
866920	867920	Hey, I still love Beatmania 2DX.
867920	868920	I will always have a soft...
868920	869920	And Keyboardmania.
869920	872440	And Keyboardmania, I will always have a soft, squishy spot in my heart for Keyboardmania.
872440	875960	By the way, completely unrelated, and Loki, once you mentioned it, I had to look it up,
875960	883200	and I think that's the most hilarious thing I've ever heard for the American Idol thing.
883200	884200	You know what?
884200	885960	I'm not derailing this show with your Idol chat.
885960	888160	Hey, it's only a few more weeks, and then it's over.
888160	889160	I'm the...
889160	890160	Thank God.
890160	891160	Oh my God.
891160	892160	I don't believe this.
892160	893160	I'm the reality TV whore of you three.
893160	897160	I am hosting a freaking survivor game on LiveJournal right now.
897160	899600	That's what a whore I am for reality TV.
899600	901600	And it's you two that do reality...
901600	905760	Dude, I explained the other night this isn't reality TV.
905760	906840	It's a talent contest.
906840	907840	There's a difference.
907840	910880	It's not a bunch of people acting like retards.
910880	912080	You don't see anything into their personal life on the show.
912080	914400	I like people acting like retards.
914400	915400	She doesn't have a point.
915400	916400	It is a contest.
916400	917400	It is a contest.
917400	920360	You're not looking at how these people are living in their daily lives.
920360	921360	And thank God for that.
921360	923320	They just interview them.
923320	927520	You're not following them as they're trying to build a hut out of coconut leaves and duct tape.
927520	930200	Wouldn't it be more fun if the Idols did have to build...
930200	931200	No.
931200	932200	No.
932200	933200	No.
933200	934200	No.
934200	935200	No.
935200	936200	No.
936200	937200	No.
937200	938200	Because, you see, this is why I don't watch any of the results show, and I just read the
938200	943160	news about watching tons of Ford commercials being their little musical numbers.
943160	947480	I actually have not watched a physical episode on TV this year.
947480	951280	All I have to say is I'm missing the Survivor Micronesia finale tonight to be here, and
951280	956240	if you spoil it in chat, I will punch you in the face, and it will hurt.
956240	957240	You've got TiVo.
957240	958240	I know.
958240	959240	But still.
959240	960560	You have TiVo.
960560	962760	I have YouTube on my phone at work.
962760	963760	All right.
963760	966040	We do have gaming news at some point during the show tonight, yes?
966040	967040	Yes.
967040	968040	Yes.
968040	971000	So this is kind of an interesting thing.
971000	975320	I guess it's got some interesting bullet points to it.
975320	978400	Guitar Hero On Tour, of course, coming out in June.
978400	981240	Well, there's rumors now that they are...
981240	987080	Activision is partnering with Nintendo to release Nintendo DS bundles that will include
987080	989880	the DS system as well as Guitar Hero On Tour.
989880	996560	It will be the first third-party kind of combo pack that they've done with the DS so far.
996560	1003440	So that's kind of neat, whoring the game out a bit, yes, I guess.
1003440	1004440	I don't know.
1004440	1009760	I would say that you would need the black and red or crimson black DS so to fully look
1009760	1013720	pretty cool with this, but I don't know.
1013720	1017360	It's neat, I guess.
1017360	1018360	I think...
1018360	1019360	I was going to say.
1019360	1021360	I think that they're doing...
1021360	1026680	I think Guitar Hero 4 is coming out in DS2, so you're not going to have to worry about
1026680	1029240	playing on tour for a long time.
1029240	1034480	Are they really going to move that many DS units with this one game?
1034480	1037680	I think it's going to sell pretty well.
1037680	1041120	It's innovative, I guess.
1041120	1044120	It's innovative, I guess.
1044120	1047280	It's an interesting peripheral, let me put it that way.
1047280	1048280	You know what?
1048280	1049280	What?
1049280	1055000	I don't know if it's an original idea at all, because the Wonderswan had the BeatMania wheel.
1055000	1056000	Scratch table.
1056000	1058720	But this is different, this is much different.
1058720	1063440	There's been games that's had add-ons of a similar nature.
1063440	1065600	I'm not saying that add-ons...
1065600	1070200	I think it's an interesting add-on, because I know when I'm thinking Guitar Hero for the
1070200	1074040	DS before they ever showed off this guitar grip thing.
1074040	1077600	I'm thinking you tap in the screen to be the music type thing.
1077600	1080360	So this is definitely a lot better than that.
1080360	1081360	I don't know.
1081360	1084640	It'd be interesting to see what they do with it.
1084640	1087080	Definitely not going to do a PSP version, because that'd be weird.
1087080	1089280	I don't know how the hell they would do that.
1089280	1095000	All right, well, more Guitar Hero news.
1095000	1100320	That is that apparently Guitar Hero is supposed to be taking a big leap.
1100320	1103160	This is again from that same conference call earlier this week from Activision.
1103160	1108120	It was the CEO of publishing, Mike Griffith, said, for the holiday we will provide a significant
1108120	1112840	leap forward in innovation for Guitar Hero worldwide on all platforms.
1112840	1119960	Meaning the PS3, the PS2, 360, DS, Wii, more information coming in the coming weeks.
1119960	1123360	Notice how there was no confirmation about the multi-instrument rumor going around about
1123360	1126120	Guitar Hero 4, but is that really innovation?
1126120	1127120	If they just...
1127120	1131120	Well, it's innovation in their eyes, because they haven't done it before, therefore it's
1131120	1133040	a first for them.
1133040	1134240	I don't know.
1134240	1137120	Something tells me there will be some type of instrument we haven't thought of yet that's
1137120	1138120	going to be in it somehow.
1138120	1139520	I mean, come on, Rob.
1139520	1143820	Look at the Wii, okay, and the Wii Wheel when they made that announcement.
1143820	1148720	That was a big step in innovation to them, despite the fact that there had been third
1148720	1151600	party games that had done that since the Wii launch.
1151600	1153400	So it's retarded.
1153400	1158560	They just pat themselves on the back and stuff, fluff themselves, I don't know what.
1158560	1161560	But it's just, it's retarded.
1161560	1163160	Nice.
1163160	1172120	So, yeah, so Guitar Hero 4, we'll see, we'll get more news on it later, I guess, and I'm
1172120	1177880	sure we'll be shocked and awed, but not really, because we already kind of figured it out.
1177880	1178880	Are we shocked and awed?
1178880	1179880	Nope.
1179880	1181880	Are we just going awed?
1181880	1182880	Maybe.
1182880	1186240	Well, guess what else should be getting some downloadable content?
1186240	1187240	What?
1187240	1188240	Well, sort of.
1188240	1191680	Samba de Amigo on Wii.
1191680	1195000	Wait, wait, you mean downloadable content on the Wii?
1195000	1196000	How is this possible?
1196000	1198000	Explain yourself.
1198000	1206960	There is, they were taking a look at the cover for Samba de Amigo, and at the top is Wii's
1206960	1209680	Pay to Play logo.
1209680	1215000	So it could be indicative of some downloadable content.
1215000	1216000	Pay to Play?
1216000	1219240	Yeah, that was something that was announced back at Game Developers Conference.
1219240	1220240	Really?
1220240	1221360	Tell me more about it, because I forget.
1221360	1225240	It's a little orange thing that looks like the Wi-Fi logo, but it's, you know, orange
1225240	1228600	that says Pay to Play on it, and basically going to indicate that there's going to be
1228600	1231140	downloadable content for the game.
1231140	1235920	I hope it's not, oh, look, Samba de Amigo, you have to pay a quarter every time you play
1235920	1236920	this game, you know, that goes...
1236920	1237920	You know...
1237920	1238920	I doubt it.
1238920	1240920	You know what I want instead of online play?
1240920	1241920	Maracas?
1241920	1243680	Where are my maracas?
1243680	1247120	I'm sure some third-party company will put out cheap plastic maracas for your...
1247120	1248120	Maraca attachments?
1248120	1249120	Yeah.
1249120	1250120	Why not?
1250120	1251800	I want my maracas, and I want to pose.
1251800	1253280	Damn it, I'm just going to bust out the new cast.
1253280	1254960	I'm sure the posing will be there.
1254960	1255960	I want maracas!
1255960	1257360	We could develop our own maraca attachment.
1257360	1258360	Here's the thing, though.
1258360	1264780	I bet you anything, because the space on the Wii is so limited, I bet you anything it is
1264780	1268920	not pay to download content, it's pay to unlock content.
1268920	1269920	Because why not?
1269920	1274100	We're already on the 360 with games like Katamari, and we need to stop referring to these things
1274100	1276040	as downloadable content and call them what they are.
1276040	1278160	You are paying to unlock something already on the disc.
1278160	1281080	You know, though, I don't know if that might be the case, because, I mean, this stuff could
1281080	1283480	be, like, MP3 format or something very similar.
1283480	1287320	You're not actually making the music to the game, it's just going along with it.
1287320	1288320	Perhaps you could...
1288320	1290640	The Dreamcast ones were actually downloadable.
1290640	1292200	And did you actually download the whole songs?
1292200	1293200	Yes, I did.
1293200	1294200	Wow.
1294200	1295200	But I thought you just got the little...
1295200	1296200	You stored them on your VMU.
1296200	1297200	Huh.
1297200	1301760	And they could maybe allow downloading content to, like, an external device, like your SD
1301760	1302760	memory card.
1302760	1306160	I also had Samba 2000, remember?
1306160	1309460	Oh yeah, I always forgot Samba de Amigo actually had a sequel.
1309460	1313000	Remember when we would do the New Year's parties at my house that you would actually show up
1313000	1314000	for?
1314000	1315000	Oh yeah.
1315000	1316760	And we would bust out Samba de Amigo at least three years in a row?
1316760	1317760	Good times.
1317760	1318760	I love Samba de Amigo.
1318760	1320320	Because it was all about playing the Burning Rangers theme.
1320320	1323320	I almost want to get the Wii one, just for retro sake.
1323320	1324320	I'm going to get the Wii one.
1324320	1325320	I mean, it has Take On Me.
1325320	1326320	At least the old one did.
1326320	1329040	I don't know if the new one does.
1329040	1330780	We'll see.
1330780	1331780	We will see.
1331780	1333200	And what, Burning Rangers?
1333200	1338760	Well, while we're waiting for actual download content on the Wii, whether, I guess, Samba
1338760	1343080	de Amigo is going to be the first one or not, in the meantime, though, in July, we are going
1343080	1349120	to be getting something not quite downloadable, but expanding on with Rock Band Track Pack
1349120	1350120	Volume 1.
1350120	1352720	It's coming to the PlayStation 2 and the Wii.
1352720	1358120	What's kind of neat about this game, actually, it's not really adding on to the game.
1358120	1360640	I mean, it's almost like its own game.
1360640	1362240	It has its own songs.
1362240	1369600	They've got a list of about, I want to say there's, looks like, 10, 15 tracks there.
1369600	1376000	And all stuff that's currently available on Xbox Live or Kitten PlayStation Network, like
1376000	1382840	30 Seconds to Mars, The Kill, Blink-182, all the small things, Kiss, Calling Dr. Love,
1382840	1383840	and so on.
1383840	1391040	And so if you actually, if you don't own Rock Band, you can just buy this for like $29.99,
1391040	1392040	if you want.
1392040	1393280	I guess it will contain 20 songs.
1393280	1396280	Wait, so even if you don't own normal Rock Band, you can still buy this disc?
1396280	1397280	Yes.
1397280	1399240	So it's not like an append disc where you have to have the normal game?
1399240	1400240	No.
1400240	1401240	You can actually just play it by itself.
1401240	1402240	Interesting.
1402240	1404880	I don't know why people would do that.
1404880	1409960	I don't know why either, but I mean like if you own a PlayStation 3, say for example,
1409960	1416080	and you know, you happen to have one that does still play PlayStation 2 discs, you can
1416080	1420680	use the PlayStation 3 guitars, because they're the same as the PlayStation 2 guitars, to
1420680	1421800	play this game.
1421800	1422800	Or drums.
1422800	1423800	So.
1423800	1424800	Interesting.
1424800	1425800	Yeah.
1425800	1426800	Alright, well.
1426800	1427800	Or you could just pay to download the songs.
1427800	1428800	I mean, you could just do that.
1428800	1434400	Well, you know, or if you own a PlayStation 2 and a Wii, or a Wii I guess, you don't really
1434400	1435400	have the option.
1435400	1437400	Thank you, Nintendo.
1437400	1441920	Well, there's some more Rock Band news that's kind of interesting this week, and it has
1441920	1446680	to do with more Rock Band tracks, but this time it's free tracks, and we like free, but
1446680	1450120	it's kind of the way that you get them, which is very interesting.
1450120	1453920	The band Disturbed apparently is going to be having some tracks in Rock Band, and the
1453920	1457920	only way you get this is by pre-ordering their latest CD, which I think is Indestructible?
1457920	1459440	Is that what it's called?
1459440	1464080	You pre-order this CD, and then you actually can get the songs that apparently will not
1464080	1466400	be going public until June.
1466400	1468560	I guess it'll go on the public download service then.
1468560	1470040	You can get these songs.
1470040	1472360	So kind of an interesting band tie in there.
1472360	1477960	Also, South Park season 11, which kind of ironic if you ask me, because South Park season
1477960	1483160	11 is the one that has the episode that spoofs Guitar Hero, and you even see the picture
1483160	1489660	on the cover of the season 11 DVDs is that it has Stan and Kyle from that episode playing
1489660	1490660	Guitar Hero.
1490660	1496560	What's interesting is apparently if you buy that DVD set, you get three Rock Band tracks
1496560	1501200	with it, and it's not the first time South Park would have tied into Rock Band, because
1501200	1503960	think Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld is one of the unlocked songs in the game,
1503960	1504960	which is pretty awesome.
1504960	1506280	I hope it's actual South Park songs.
1506280	1507840	I hope they're South Park songs, too.
1507840	1510320	Like DVDA, Now You're a Man.
1510320	1512520	Or Shut Your Fucking Face, Uncle Fucker.
1512520	1513960	I love some of the stuff from the movie.
1513960	1515220	That would be great.
1515220	1516220	Or what was this song?
1516220	1518220	Little Boy, You're Going to Hell.
1518220	1519220	Remember that?
1519220	1520920	It also has a good guitar riff in it.
1520920	1522920	That'd be great.
1522920	1523920	We'll see.
1523920	1524920	All right.
1524920	1528000	In the meantime, we're going to take a little trip to our mailbag.
1528000	1532200	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and Dark Sakura rips
1532200	1536480	open the email bag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails to read for you guys,
1536480	1540720	and unfortunately, though, it's Slim Pickens in the mailbag this week.
1540720	1542600	Sounds like not a lot of folks emailed us.
1542600	1546480	Dark Sakura's going to pick her two favorite emails tonight to read for you right now,
1546480	1550920	but if you want to email us for a future week, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
1550920	1551920	Dark Sakura, take it away.
1551920	1555660	Well, I did get a couple from Rob with Two Bs, but I'm actually still reading over them,
1555660	1559200	so I'll have to save them for next week.
1559200	1566700	First one comes from Katamari's Forever, a good Sunday to you, O-L-R. That's so pleasant.
1566700	1569740	I'd like to start my letter regarding what I wrote last week.
1569740	1574440	Having copied down what Act Deaf said on Part B two weeks ago, I tried removing Photo Channel,
1574440	1579640	but since I didn't download it in the first place, it wasn't there to delete.
1579640	1584040	I would also like to state that since the show reaches 1 a.m. in Michigan, I usually
1584040	1587880	go live during Part A and go to sleep during the beginning of Part B. I can't thank you
1587880	1591640	enough for providing a podcast through your RSS feed so that I can listen later.
1591640	1599120	Now, I would like to address a popular issue that I've seen recently in games, their ratings.
1599120	1604480	It seems that every new release title gets to be a number one on aggregate sites like
1604480	1608440	Gamer Kings, only to fall down to the top 30 a week later.
1608440	1615080	Do exclusive reviews usually skew opinions, hence the 100% that a PS3 version of Grand
1615080	1617120	Theft Auto IV is getting?
1617120	1622280	I mean, sure, the first reviews usually spew out love, but it's usually the first people
1622280	1624680	who influence the next, right?
1624680	1630880	If so, for example, GameSpot gave a game like Okami for Wii a 9.0 when the other reviewers
1630880	1631880	follow suit.
1631880	1633680	I guess it's just buzz.
1633680	1635680	Which brings me to my other point.
1635680	1637440	Where's Bioshock?
1637440	1643360	In a mere amount of months, the 2007 game of the year just vanished out of thin air.
1643360	1649400	Nowadays, I don't hear a peep about this legendary game anymore, but just to whoop to and braw
1649400	1654240	and testimonials about GTA IV, seriously, I've got a friend who calls this game quote
1654240	1657280	the truth.
1657280	1659920	Are gamers really that ADD?
1659920	1660920	Yes.
1660920	1661920	Yes.
1661920	1664640	Two random things I want to address.
1664640	1666640	Why does Rob hate Toadette?
1666640	1671000	She's just the same as Toad, and Mario Kart Wii is very nice, but bikes seem unusable
1671000	1673120	when playing with the Wii wheel.
1673120	1677200	Okay, here's the thing about Toadette and why I don't like her is, A, Toad's voice,
1677200	1680440	I love Toad, but his voice is kind of annoying, I'll admit.
1680440	1683040	I like Toad circa Super Mario 2.
1683040	1687400	Toadette takes that voice and makes it 20 times even more like fingernails on chalkboard.
1687400	1690520	But here's the other thing about Nintendo that I kind of don't like the little pattern
1690520	1697880	they developed where it was like Mario and Wario, Luigi and Waluigi, Donkey Kong and
1697880	1698880	Diddy Kong.
1698880	1701000	Everybody has this freaking relative, right?
1701000	1704720	So by the time Toad and Toadette came around, I was like, okay, enough.
1704720	1707000	Waluigi's funny because his name's sort of a pun.
1707000	1708760	And so I take out all my hatred on Toadette.
1708760	1712400	Well, they need Peach and her slutty cousin Cherry.
1712400	1713400	Here's Daisy.
1713400	1715120	Ah, who gives a shit about Daisy?
1715120	1717120	Are you thinking of that episode of Drawn Together?
1717120	1718120	I don't know.
1718120	1719120	Never mind.
1719120	1720120	Never mind.
1720120	1721120	Can I continue?
1721120	1722120	You may.
1722120	1724840	Sorry about the long letter, I'll be sure to talk about something else next time.
1724840	1726280	Katamari's forever.
1726280	1730480	Change is inevitable, except at the Olive Garden where endless soup, salad, and breadsticks
1730480	1735040	are $9.95 every day, excluding Australia LOL.
1735040	1738480	I love how all of our emails now have to end their email with some type of Home of the
1738480	1740600	Never Ending or Olive Garden reference.
1740600	1741600	Love it.
1741600	1746600	Hey Sky, Dark Sakura, and Loki, thank you for playing my entry for the contest on the
1746600	1747600	show.
1747600	1751360	And I'm glad you guys liked it and said it was great, that really means a lot to me.
1751360	1755760	It's a shame that few people are entering to win, but I guess that most people listening
1755760	1758400	already own an Xbox 360 or PS3.
1758400	1762160	I'm curious to hear the other entries for the contest though, so keep us informed.
1762160	1768160	Oh yeah, I've got a story for you guys about how I got to know your podcast.
1768160	1773840	I was actually looking for podcasts with lounge music, so I typed lounge podcast and something
1773840	1776760	like that into Google and it led me to your website.
1776760	1780560	I downloaded an episode and the beginning was like Sky's famous intro beginning with
1780560	1783920	video games, video gaming, and gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
1783920	1787880	Being a gamer myself, I thought, hey, I'll check this out, and I actually laughed my
1787880	1789640	ass off.
1789640	1792440	And I was immediately hooked, mouthpiece.
1792440	1795760	So there you have it, a somewhat unusual way of getting to know you guys, but the name
1795760	1799520	Orange Lounge Radio really paid off.
1799520	1803840	Which is funny because a lot of times I think we haven't been discovered because our title
1803840	1807640	does not have game in it, and people are like, what does Orange Lounge have to do with video
1807640	1808640	games?
1808640	1810320	So it's just kind of funny that the reverse worked.
1810320	1811320	It's ditter.
1811320	1812320	That's great.
1812320	1816880	By the way, Sky, you do sound like Lowslow from GTA a lot, smile face, but that's not
1816880	1818560	a bad thing because he's so funny.
1818560	1819560	Oh, okay then.
1819560	1820760	I forgive you.
1820760	1823720	Keep up the great show, lots of love from Belgium, Martin.
1823720	1829160	Okay, now DarkSakura, it occurred to me you weren't here last week, so you didn't hear
1829160	1831720	his entry, but the problem was he was ineligible because-
1831720	1832720	I did hear it.
1832720	1833720	You did?
1833720	1834720	I played it the week before.
1834720	1835720	Oh.
1835720	1836720	This was the really funny-
1836720	1837720	Oh, you know what it was?
1837720	1839480	I didn't play it on air that time you heard it.
1839480	1840480	Yeah.
1840480	1841480	Okay, then you've heard it.
1841480	1842480	All right.
1842480	1843480	Yeah.
1843480	1844480	But we played it on air last week, right?
1844480	1845480	Yeah.
1845480	1846480	All right.
1846480	1847480	Yeah.
1847480	1848480	That's what I thought, and you weren't here last week, so.
1848480	1849480	Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1849480	1850480	What?
1850480	1851480	We have one more.
1851480	1852480	Okay.
1852480	1853480	Better be short.
1853480	1854480	It is.
1854480	1855480	It's really short.
1855480	1856480	All right.
1856480	1857480	It's from GS68.
1857480	1858480	All right.
1858480	1859480	Hey, OLR crew.
1859480	1860480	I've got seven words for Black Wolf.
1860480	1861760	What do you have against the ferret?
1861760	1863160	What is the ferret?
1863160	1864160	I don't know.
1864160	1865160	We'll have to ask.
1865160	1866160	Where's my baby?
1866160	1867160	Where's my baby?
1867160	1868160	I hit him last week when you weren't here.
1868160	1869160	You butt.
1869160	1870160	No, I don't know.
1870160	1871160	I actually don't know.
1871160	1872160	I seriously don't know where the ferret is.
1872160	1873160	It's somewhere around here.
1873160	1874160	He's hiding from Bobby.
1874160	1875160	Hopefully I threw him away.
1875160	1876160	No.
1876160	1877160	No, I'm just kidding.
1877160	1878160	He's hiding from Bobby.
1878160	1879160	I think it's-
1879160	1880160	You traumatized the baby ferret.
1880160	1886480	I think there's a little bit of a rivalry between our mascot, the ferret, and Bobby,
1886480	1889800	and I'm not sure who it belongs to, Bobby or Super Happy Fun Time Show, but Clicky the
1889800	1890800	Pen.
1890800	1891800	I think there's some type of rivalry there.
1891800	1892800	Clicky the Pen.
1892800	1893800	Yes.
1893800	1897240	But the ferret has cuteness.
1897240	1898240	That's true.
1898240	1899240	But the pen goes click.
1899240	1900640	But the pens are also useful.
1900640	1901640	All right.
1901640	1902640	Anyhow.
1902640	1906480	Ferrets are useful too because you can throw them at your co-host.
1906480	1907760	If you can find it.
1907760	1908760	All right.
1908760	1909760	Hey.
1909760	1910760	Watch.
1910760	1911760	I'll find another ferret.
1911760	1913400	All right.
1913400	1914720	That's it for the email this week.
1914720	1919960	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you have some emails you would like to contribute.
1919960	1927020	But we've got some more gaming news, and then we are minutes away from a brand new OLR game.
1927020	1928680	You don't even know what it is yet.
1928680	1930120	I think it's going to be fun.
1930120	1931120	I'm excited.
1931120	1932960	Or it will suck and we'll never play it again.
1932960	1933960	That's what happens to games.
1933960	1937160	They're either really good or they suck and we never play them again.
1937160	1938160	All right.
1938160	1940960	So let's go over to Loki for another story.
1940960	1943200	All right.
1943200	1949240	So this isn't a big surprise because they were talking that Bazaar was going to be working
1949240	1951840	on a new Bond game.
1951840	1958880	Well, may not be Bazaar, but apparently Treyarch is working on a new Bond game and it's going
1958880	1965500	to be Bond Quantum of Solace, which is going to be released the third quarter of this year
1965500	1966960	along with the movie.
1966960	1971520	It will be running on the Call of Duty 4 engine, which, I mean, hey, if they're going to pick
1971520	1977160	a first person shooter engine to run it on, that's probably the best one to pick.
1977160	1978600	So that should be pretty awesome.
1978600	1981400	Maybe another GoldenEye, you know, because the multiplayer in Call of Duty 4 is pretty
1981400	1982400	awesome.
1982400	1984240	So we'll have to see.
1984240	1990800	But the film is being released in the UK on October 31st, November 7th in North America.
1990800	1994680	Does that mean that we'll actually get the game then?
1994680	1996000	Or do you think we'll have to wait for the DVD?
1996000	1997520	I think it will come out fourth.
1997520	1998980	Why does it say third quarter?
1998980	1999980	It's fourth quarter.
1999980	2004680	I guess third quarter financial quarter, I guess, for them.
2004680	2005960	But yeah, fourth quarter.
2005960	2007920	So that would make sense.
2007920	2009320	All right.
2009320	2013460	Well, other fours in the industry this week, Doom 4.
2013460	2014460	That's right.
2014460	2016600	Doom 4 was announced this week.
2016600	2019540	It's been a few years since we've had an entry in the Doom franchise.
2019540	2024820	There was Doom 3 a few years ago, like I remember that was on the Xbox One, but Doom 4 is on
2024820	2026160	its way.
2026160	2031280	And CEO Todd Hollensheet said this week in a press release, quote, Doom is part of the
2031280	2036320	ID software DNA and demands the greatest talent and brightest minds in the industry to bring
2036320	2040360	the next installment of our flagship franchise to Earth.
2040360	2042280	There are no other details given at this time.
2042280	2047240	Speculation is that ID's Tech 5 engine will be used.
2047240	2048240	And who knows?
2048240	2051040	And story-wise, who knows where this game could go.
2051040	2055140	But then again, if the movie didn't kill the franchise, then, you know, it could go anywhere.
2055140	2056140	So Doom 4.
2056140	2057440	Are you excited about Doom 4?
2057440	2058440	No.
2058440	2062600	I thought Doom 3 looked really awesome, but I don't know, it didn't have the charm of
2062600	2063880	Doom 1 and Doom 2 for me.
2063880	2065080	I never really liked Doom.
2065080	2066680	Are you playing Doom for the charm?
2066680	2067680	Yes, for the charm.
2067680	2070700	I like Doom 1 and 2 for the mods, but that's about it.
2070700	2072600	I didn't really care for the games.
2072600	2074720	I didn't even really get in the Quake either.
2074720	2076920	Duke Nukem 3D, that was my game.
2076920	2078200	You know what I liked about Doom?
2078200	2083360	I just, you know, I don't know, Wolfenstein, that was a good game.
2083360	2084480	Just Doom didn't do it for me.
2084480	2090880	I think mainly Doom didn't do it for me because at the time my PC couldn't run it.
2090880	2095200	Only had one meg of RAM, so, you know, it was a little tough to run that game.
2095200	2099400	Your friend and mine, Bobby Black Wolf in chat, says ID makes great engines.
2099400	2101520	They don't make great games.
2101520	2107720	I liked the first Doom because, first of all, it had a difficulty level called Hurt Me Plenty.
2107720	2110520	And, secondly, the Wolfenstein levels.
2110520	2111520	Alright.
2111520	2116120	It's all about IDDQD and IDBFG.
2116120	2117840	Don't forget Hexen and how frickin' awesome that game is.
2117840	2120840	Hexen was great because of the NRA code.
2120840	2122200	All weapons.
2122200	2123200	Hi.
2123200	2124200	Alright, we are gonna...
2124200	2126200	In god mode with Satan.
2126200	2127200	Awesome.
2127200	2129960	Alright, we are gonna go to the Skype line.
2129960	2132720	In fact, if you heard a little background noise, it's because we already picked it up,
2132720	2136040	where we have two people sitting on the Skype line right now, if I'm not mistaken.
2136040	2137800	Toshin, you are there, correct?
2137800	2138800	Yes, I am.
2138800	2139800	Hi, Toshin.
2139800	2140800	How are you?
2140800	2141800	I'm good.
2141800	2142800	Alright.
2142800	2143800	And FootyMonster, you're there too, right?
2143800	2144800	Yep, I am here.
2144800	2147080	How are you doing, FootyMonster?
2147080	2148080	Doing very well, actually.
2148080	2149080	Thank you.
2149080	2150080	Alright.
2150080	2151080	Now, we've got a little bit of a score to settle in.
2151080	2155720	I don't even know how this came about, but it turned out that we have this res code we've
2155720	2160840	been trying to give away for, like, I don't know, like two months, and somehow we found
2160840	2162520	out that you two didn't have it.
2162520	2166320	And which is so funny, because tonight, like, everybody's been PMing me, like, I wanna play,
2166320	2167640	I wanna play, because I want the code.
2167640	2171600	But no, no, we said a couple weeks ago it was gonna be Toshin versus Footy, but we originally
2171600	2175300	said we were gonna play the match game, but I hate to break it to you guys, we thought
2175300	2176660	of something new.
2176660	2180360	So we're gonna subject you to a new game tonight, because we can do that, it's our show.
2180360	2181760	I am very scared about this.
2181760	2182760	You should be.
2182760	2183760	Are you scared, Toshin?
2183760	2184760	Yes.
2184760	2185760	Alright.
2185760	2190600	Well, let's unveil the game that Toshin and Footy will be playing tonight for the Res
2190600	2193480	HD code.
2193480	2198560	That's right.
2198560	2205480	It's the OLR Family Feud will be what Toshin and Footy are playing tonight.
2205480	2209320	Alright, here's the deal.
2209320	2215480	We have surveyed several OLR personalities in different video gaming categories, the
2215480	2220120	OLR family, if you will, and you two will be competing against each other head to head
2220120	2221560	to see who can earn more points.
2221560	2223680	Here's how you earn more points.
2223680	2226900	You're gonna pick a number one through four that will be the board that you play when
2226900	2228360	it's your turn.
2228360	2233160	And on the board are the top answers in a particular video gaming category, like let's
2233160	2235480	say best game ever.
2235480	2239160	And you can take turns at the board to see what the hosts and our friends would have
2239160	2241640	said was the best game ever.
2241640	2245440	If you don't guess correctly, you guess something that's not on the board, you get a strike.
2245440	2250160	Three strikes, and it will go to the other player who will get one chance to steal the
2250160	2252800	board and all of your points.
2252800	2256200	So you definitely don't want to have your board stolen.
2256200	2257280	So it sounds good.
2257280	2259600	Are you familiar with the show Toshin?
2259600	2260600	Yes I am.
2260600	2262160	Alright, are you familiar with the show, Footy?
2262160	2264200	I have no idea what you just said.
2264200	2265200	Alright.
2265200	2267200	Well then you're in trouble my friend.
2267200	2269080	Alright, well here's the thing.
2269080	2271180	We'll have Toshin go first then.
2271180	2276080	So that way, Footy, hopefully you can figure out what's going on quickly, alright?
2276080	2278000	Okay, basically it comes down to what?
2278000	2283600	I have to say a name of a person that would have said what is the best game to them.
2283600	2284600	Not a person, not a person.
2284600	2287920	Let's say the category was best video game ever made.
2287920	2292120	Like since you know that I answered it, you would probably guess that Super Metroid is
2292120	2293280	somewhere on the board.
2293280	2294520	And then you'd hear ding.
2294520	2299200	But if you guessed, you know, a game that none of us, like if you guessed Crysis, then
2299200	2302600	you'd hear ehhh, because none of us would have picked that, you know, because we're
2302600	2303600	not Sakura Max.
2303600	2304600	So, okay.
2304600	2307080	So you're going to be telling us whose names are on the board?
2307080	2308080	Yes.
2308080	2309080	And then I have to guess a name?
2309080	2310080	Or, okay.
2310080	2312080	Yes, I'm going to, no you don't have to guess a name, you just have to guess the answers
2312080	2313080	that are on the board.
2313080	2314080	This is getting complicated.
2314080	2315080	Alright.
2315080	2316080	Alright.
2316080	2317080	That's alright.
2317080	2318080	Okay.
2318080	2319080	Alright, here is the OLR family that have contributed to tonight's answers.
2319080	2324400	Myself, Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura, Loki has contributed to the board tonight, Bobby Blackwolf
2324400	2330560	contributed to the board tonight, Miklatov contributed to the board tonight, RicePrincess
2330560	2333200	and DMN all have contributed answers to the board.
2333200	2339480	So there are seven possible answers, but sometimes answers are worth more because multiple people
2339480	2340480	said them.
2340480	2344000	Like, for instance, if it had been best game ever, Chrono Trigger probably would have been
2344000	2345000	worth like three points.
2345000	2347000	So, does that make sense?
2347000	2348000	Yeah.
2348000	2349000	Alright.
2349000	2350000	Here we go.
2350000	2352560	Oh, we have to do it just like they do on the show.
2352560	2356360	Let's play The Feud.
2356360	2358100	I said, let's play The Feud.
2358100	2359100	Where's the damn music?
2359100	2360160	There we go.

3186800	3190320	Play the games. They're big difference. All right, Jamie said kangaroo
3191120	3192960	Loki said combat
3192960	3194960	Shane said spider-man
3195360	3197360	Irene said missile command and
3197360	3202840	DM n said warlords were the answers that were left on the board. So there you have it
3203800	3207240	Argentina and footy monster wins five to three
3207760	3213540	But you know what since you guys subjected yourself to that game. You know what we're gonna give
3214200	3217560	Courtesy of olr. We're giving you both res HD. How's that sound?
3219120	3223680	We're gonna give it to both you guys. So here's how to work. I'm act deft has the code so act deft
3223680	3228120	I'm gonna have you send that code over to footy cuz he'll get his right away for actually winning and
3228560	3233080	Toshin, you'll get yours later. You're actually probably gonna give you just Microsoft point so you can buy it. Okay?
3235120	3237120	What
3238720	3242080	I want as much as anybody else right now. Well, you want it anyway
3242080	3245280	You just got to wait a little while four to six weeks for shipping and handling. All right
3246000	3249200	That was fun. Actually, I had that was a fun game. Did you like the game?
3249200	3253440	I didn't know what I was eating. I did actually like to want to see a chat chat room. Did you guys like the game?
3253440	3255880	Should we do it again in the future? I want to see you in the chat
3255880	3256640	All right
3256640	3257800	so well
3257800	3264220	Thank you guys very much for playing and subjecting yourself to the olr family feud featuring the crappy soundboard
3268320	3270320	All right
3271520	3274760	All right guys, we're gonna hang up on you and have a good night, okay
3274760	3280200	Okay, you guys all right, but by and footy, let me know if act deaf doesn't get you the code because I have it somewhere
3280200	3282200	But I'm sure he'll send it to you. Okay
3282200	3286440	You just send me a message asking for my email. So I'm guessing we're in the works. Wonderful
3286440	3289360	All right, have a good one. All right toshin. I'll be in touch with you. All right. Bye. Bye
3290000	3291400	Yeah
3291400	3296560	All right. No, so did you guys like the game? It went on for like 20 minutes, but it was cool
3296560	3298960	It's sort of fun a little different. All right
3299560	3301560	Let's see. I
3301560	3305920	I like the concept but it's a horrible game. You can't you can't get anyone's answers
3305920	3309200	The group is being the group being surveyed is way too difficult to predict
3309400	3312200	It's funny to hear their answers, but near impossible to get guess them
3312800	3317280	Hmm like that's any better than like the match game. We'll see. Well, yeah, I know
3317600	3322160	Well, we'll try it. We'll try a version. Maybe we'll survey the entire chat room before the show
3322160	3325400	We'll see but then but then the chatters know what's coming. That's the problem
3325400	3328500	That's why we didn't do it that way this time because then they know what questions are coming now
3328500	3334440	I just see you so this is fine the way it was. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see they can quit their bitching. All right
3336160	3339460	All right, well, uh, we'll see what happens with that in the future in the meantime
3339560	3341280	We've got to go back to some more news
3341280	3344400	We got more gaming news just a little bit and then we're gonna open the skype line
3344760	3349440	For you guys to give us a call with your own thoughts on fire. Yes, and then we'll set the skype line on fire
3349440	3357680	Go. All right any excuse for me to play the pac-man noise again. We will be welcomed. All right, next story, please ninja guide in to
3358400	3360520	If you pre-order it you get stuff
3361680	3362920	the end
3362920	3366040	What kind of stuff the first 39,000 people to?
3366760	3369120	pre-order their copy and pick it up from a
3369960	3371960	selected retailers
3372000	3376000	Are going to get a set of armor in the game that?
3376000	3380400	Let's you look like the bad guys that you're facing it's a
3381720	3384840	basically a nice big costume for you, so
3385800	3392660	However, if you are of the more patient variety, you can download a costume pack of three
3393200	3394080	in
3394080	3397280	July which will be 200 Microsoft points
3398240	3402600	It's going to have Ninja guidance who will be out in Europe on the 6th of June
3402600	3405920	So you can test out how fun it is then
3407760	3409640	All right
3409640	3412060	Yay, yay indeed stuff
3412680	3414120	All right. I like stuff
3414120	3419480	I just don't like having to pre-order games because then a better deal will come out of the game the day the game comes out
3419920	3421640	Yeah
3421640	3425640	Well, there's gonna be hopefully some interesting news coming very soon
3426480	3427400	apparently
3427400	3432800	Microsoft is having a PR event next week where they're going to
3433480	3441280	Supposedly debut the new Xbox 360 motion controller, and of course we talked about last week their partnership with gyration
3442760	3448360	Also the other things that they're going to be unveiling and I know this is probably going to happen is banjo-kazooie 3
3448720	3452160	In fact there's been some screenshots. I've already come out for that so
3452160	3460480	It's going to be interesting to see what goes on, and this is during the game critics awards, I guess
3461360	3463760	That's supposed to happen next week, so I
3465600	3471120	Don't know we'll see all right. You know what actually um a good idea came to us
3471120	3475640	I'm going to get can I read this aloud for the family Feud. I I guess so sure
3475640	3482440	I think this is a good idea is that we could survey the chat room for family Feud and have people in studio play like
3482440	3487420	When we have some of our guests here like we could get like rice princess and mo to battle each other we could get
3488200	3493300	Nathan and next offer or something like get some guests on the show to battle each other that might be kind of fun
3494080	3499040	That might be a little bit access to the chat room exactly that that then it would be a secret
3499040	3505160	I like that idea we have to make them face like us. We'll see a panel in this chat room feud at that point
3505160	3508940	Maybe that's what we'll rename it to the chat room feud all right anyhow. Sorry
3508940	3514120	I didn't mean to derail from the topic of the games. Yes, you did. Yeah, I did a little bit, but I mean
3515160	3519600	How much of a we ripoff is this going to be if at all or do you think they are going a totally different?
3519600	3521920	Direction with this if true it depends what they do with it
3521920	3525400	I think if they're if it's going to be like the other Q motion stuff
3525400	3530680	Which is essentially you buy like something that looks like a bowling ball something looks like a you know
3530680	3536520	Golf club and something like that. I don't know how popular that's gonna be it'll be nifty
3536680	3541320	but it's not gonna be something that I think you'd have to go run out right away and buy and
3541920	3546180	Also, I would I would like to see them to come up with something a little bit more universal
3546180	3551080	So you're not buying this huge peripheral for one game because I'm kind of retarded
3551640	3556560	but I don't know we'll have to see what they come up with I think it's gonna be hard for them not to
3557400	3559400	be kind of
3559400	3562560	Accused of ripping off Nintendo, so
3563480	3567760	Because even Sony was accused of ripping off Nintendo when that six axis was thrown in at the last minute
3567760	3572760	Remember that that and that was wasn't even really the same thing. You know what I mean, but still though
3572760	3578540	It's just like oh, and now it has motion sensitive stuff and and really
3579080	3582880	Would that pan out to I mean hardly any games use it. So I
3583640	3585080	don't
3585080	3587000	All right
3587000	3592100	Anyhow, we got one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're gonna be getting to the skype line here very shortly
3592680	3595760	But this next story requires some music
3598840	3604040	And you know what that means somebody earned themselves a stupid award this week in some horrific
3604960	3610520	Amount of violence and the person who wins the stupid award on olr this week is Edward Stoddard
3611440	3615340	Congratulations. He was arrested in Dade City and you know what he did
3615340	3621100	He murdered his neighbor over a missing PlayStation 3. That's right
3621100	3628220	He murdered Douglas Abrams because they were arguing over the PlayStation 3 on April 24th
3629420	3635940	No really word on what it was that they were specifically arguing about but it just kind of begs the question is a PlayStation 3
3636340	3638340	really worth killing someone over
3639380	3643260	That's what I would have been playing grand thought of for on said PlayStation 3
3643260	3646380	But it just goes to show you know
3647140	3651980	Regardless, you know, obviously this guy obviously has issues. He needs to he needs to play Wii ethics
3651980	3656620	Is it appropriate to kill someone over a missing video game console? Yes or no?
3656620	3662140	And if you say yes, then the console spits acid at you or something, I don't know. But wait, that's that's not good
3662140	3664140	That's awesome. All right
3664140	3668260	Whoa wrong answer die you need to be rinsing acid
3668260	3670260	But
3671820	3672820	What
3672820	3675660	Instead of it being like, you know, highly corrosive acid
3675660	3680500	It should be like minor lee corrosive acid so that they're left with chemical burns and you all know that they scored wrong
3680820	3684100	You I think that would be great. You've got issues
3684700	3691180	No, because it wouldn't kill them. It just maimed them a little and everyone would know that they're stupid. All right
3691820	3697500	Anyway, stupid award stories usually make me a little bit angsty and also the fact that I forgot to put it anywhere else
3697500	3699500	Yeah
3700700	3704620	That's right, I caught it I can't save myself. Yeah CF use of the week
3719660	3725940	My fu of the week now, I told Rob what it was on Friday, but I've decided to expand it a little bit and
3725940	3727940	my
3728380	3734260	My fu of the week is to people who buy into what they're told without
3734980	3742380	Researching it first and my primary example was the practice of circumcising little boys. Ow
3743100	3744860	crossing legs
3744860	3746860	because I
3746860	3750440	understand that for religious purposes as part of your culture, but
3750440	3757160	For purpose of aesthetics or thinking that it's healthy. No, it's not and actually it
3757480	3763560	Ends up being very traumatic and also makes them getting the nookie a lot less satisfying
3764520	3765800	this
3765800	3771920	so also in the same tone then it goes to people who think that
3773400	3775400	just because
3775400	3780320	Specialist a has said oh this is you know
3780320	3786080	Not what you want to do this suddenly it's law and I'm not gonna go into specifics on that in particular
3786600	3788600	but there's
3789920	3792680	Okay, actually I'm gonna sort of go into specifics on this one
3792680	3798640	That's right that there being some sort of widespread rumor that if you were a massage therapist
3798640	3806080	And you were suddenly in adult entertainment and this way I get really pissed off at the whole happy ending bullshit because
3806800	3808800	because of people who
3809280	3814280	Think that and those jokes that go around. I haven't been able to get my business license for six months
3815760	3821040	So don't I'm very very very angry about that, but they've revamped
3821040	3828520	The requirements for it in my uh in my town and made it up to where I can, you know, get my license again
3829240	3832280	It's also goes towards people who you know
3833320	3837560	It's really just a bunch of what we think a bunch of what?
3838000	3842440	we accept as fact in our daily lives is really in
3842440	3850560	In most cases the result of sensationalism and people trying to tell us what they want us to think so that we'll spend money in said
3850960	3854640	Area so that more money will go into the pockets of people who?
3855880	3858200	You know are lying to us basically
3858400	3864340	So I say research everything yourself before you believe what you see on TV or what you hear from from people
3864640	3866160	That's a lot to say
3866160	3873640	All right, I think for yourself reject false icons. Yes reject false icons Loki after you driving to and from Oakland
3874200	3876200	If I can hate that drive
3876280	3882400	It's long and boring and it's Oakland. It's Oakland. Um, my heavy. Is that it? Hey, yeah, it's a long drive
3882400	3884400	You're like, oh, yeah, Oakland
3885840	3888380	There's a yummy Indian food place in Oakland eight Ellen
3889680	3891560	Speaking of food at you to the news
3891560	3896720	I got this week that due to my pancreatus I had back in April when I was in the hospital for a few days
3897240	3903000	If you did the fact that I will be stuck on a low-fat diet for two more months, which means no Indian food
3903000	3906560	Well, I guess there's some Indian food dishes I can have but no garlic naan or the stuff
3906560	3912020	I really like for two more months at least and the fact that that means I can't have cake or ice cream on my 30th
3912020	3916500	Birthday that kind of blows but at least I'd rather be eating low-fat than be dead
3916800	3920420	So if you did that and if you did the fact that on top of you know dealing with all that
3920420	3926120	I think I'm getting a cold or something. So F you to being sick twice at the same time. It kind of sucks. I
3927000	3929000	Just want this year to go away
3929080	3932360	The show has been good though. That's one good thing about it. The show's been great
3933000	3934560	All right
3934560	3939520	Hippolytus and chat asks, dude, how much weight has sky lost? 25 pounds. I lost 25 pounds
3939520	3941720	I used to have quite a bit of a little bit of a beer gut now
3941720	3943440	I have a tiny little beer gut and
3943440	3947280	I'm gonna be starting to work out soon because I'm starting to feel a lot better like my chest and everything
3947280	3954560	So it's gonna be I'm gonna have abs by the time all is said and done. We'll see at least that's the goal
3955680	3957680	All right
3958600	3965220	Let's move on to the skype line we're gonna be taking some calls on the skype line
3967360	3972680	You can call us at 1 8 7 7 game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio
3972680	3976140	We don't have time for a lot of calls tonight, but we'll definitely try to get some calls
3976140	3979700	In so you can call us right now while we wait for some calls
3979700	3986220	Do you have a quick last-minute story for us Matt? Yeah prototypes been delayed to 2009. What's prototype is this game?
3986220	3991340	It's like crackdown, but you're like a mutant you crazy shit jump around big sandbox game
3991900	3993580	Interesting come out this fall
3993580	3994980	2009 now
3994980	4001020	Well, that's too bad. Yeah, anything else? Uh kill zone 2 is officially announced for February 2009
4001420	4004820	So that's pretty awesome. I think resistance still coming out this fall
4004820	4008860	So and then we have that to look forward to but kill zone 2 pretty cool
4009140	4013880	There was some footage online for that, but apparently got yanked because it wasn't supposed to be out yet. Oh
4014700	4018380	Well, that sucks. Let's go to Z phones
4019140	4021460	Hello, you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this? Oh
4023940	4028680	My god, it's clicky the pen clicky who gave you access to a telephone
4028680	4030680	I
4033280	4037800	I'm sorry sky he he must have butt-dialed you guys or something. I don't know. I was crying
4037800	4043480	It's what it's Bobby was clicky trying to flirt with the ferret. I think that's what it was. I think he's demanding ransom
4043480	4049440	I think he knows where the ferret is. I think clicky kidnapped the ferret for money. That's that's amazing
4049480	4052160	What's on your mind Bobby to what do we owe this call tonight?
4052160	4057080	Or was it just clicky trying to get through it was clicky trying to get through but hi, but now that you're here
4057080	4061000	Oh any anything in news? This is a very busy week for news. I
4061560	4066920	Know you talked to it's always funny because you know you do the show that's on right before us on all games calm at five
4066920	4071600	o'clock Pacific and you were talking about the whole DRM digital rights management thing, which I
4072160	4076840	Read about earlier this week and I was like I want to talk about it this week on orange launch radio
4076840	4079960	And then it didn't even make it in our show role because I forgot
4082920	4083840	All right
4083840	4088720	Well low key get some up what happened real quick because I want to get Bobby's opinion on this and our other opinions
4089080	4094240	Originally EA came up with this wonderful idea that both Mass Effect and spore. We're gonna need to be
4095040	4100040	Validated via I guess an online call home thing every 10 days
4100040	4104120	And if it didn't do that it wouldn't work anymore, so
4105680	4108800	That sucked, but then they came out and decided hey
4108800	4114160	We're not gonna do that because people don't like that kind of thing so now Mass Effect's only it's gonna
4114880	4119840	Authenticate itself when you first install it and then if you download any additional download content
4119840	4126600	It'll redo that as well same as spore spore once you install it and also if you connect to online
4128760	4131040	So a Bobby what are your thoughts on this?
4131040	4134240	I don't want to spoil your whole show because I know you you go into it on your show
4134240	4136320	But what quickly what were kind of your thoughts on this issue?
4136320	4142600	Well my thing was more because you know they're trying to market spore because will right is was on the Colbert report
4142600	4144720	He's been doing the late-night talk show rounds
4144880	4151560	They're trying to market spore to a larger audience than just gamers and not every person who has a computer
4152280	4153800	actually has
4153800	4159480	Internet access from their home either they use it for work, or they go to a public library or something you know
4159480	4163000	They may have a decent computer, but it may not necessarily be online
4163000	4170160	And so you know even that one-time activation may be a problem for some people because they're used to just getting this DVD
4170360	4175080	Or CD and sticking in their computer and playing and now you can't do that now you have to have this other charge
4175240	4177240	You have to have internet service from your home
4177400	4180940	Just to play it and the reason that they got rid of the 10-day
4181240	4184000	Phoning home every 10 days was actually because of the US Armed Forces
4184520	4189400	They can't guarantee an internet connection when they're overseas, but they still play games on their PC
4189400	4194400	They do have downtime to get their mind off of what they're doing right, and I think that's why they got rid of the 10-day
4194400	4198000	Restriction, but there's still that first time and then any other time when you're online
4198520	4200560	Then it will check, but it's not going to force you
4200640	4204360	But I think it still leaves out a segment of the population that doesn't have internet at home
4204880	4209120	Why would think especially in the case of the Armed Forces who are doing you know a big job?
4209360	4211560	That not a lot of people want to do for this country
4211560	4212720	I would hope that EA
4212720	4218200	Would come up with a way that they can bypass it at least the Armed Forces can get a special version of the game or
4218200	4223920	Something now granted you know there's a special version of the game that the Armed Forces got it would be on the internet that yeah
4223920	4228380	I guess that's the unfortunate side of that is that would happen, but somehow like I don't know
4228380	4231800	There's got to be something that even they do even with this. I think it's gonna be broken
4231800	4237880	It doesn't matter everybody finds a way to get past everything. That's true. It wasn't didn't Bioshock do something similar
4238520	4240840	Yeah, but people found ways around that yeah
4240840	4243640	And people like you would only let you install it on so many computers
4243640	4249040	And it had to connect to the internet each time and then once it hit its limit too bad so sad. I guess yeah
4249040	4250800	Yeah, something like that
4250800	4255240	Frisbee points out in chat room the portal retail version requires online to start up which
4255440	4259660	Well, I don't know because I bought it on steam and steam does all that copy protection stuff
4259660	4265600	You know kind of as part of I think you have to have steam when you buy the retail version. Oh, oh, that's right
4265600	4270600	That's right. I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago. Not that I know or anything, but they found a way around that
4270600	4274600	You you heard I heard yeah, okay?
4276440	4283240	Is that from your independent research that you did it's from I own I own the orange box on you know Xbox 360
4283240	4285240	I just want to see would look like I'm a PC
4286640	4289960	All right Bobby anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight
4290640	4297400	No, that's that that was it. It was I blame eight wait a minute click clicky. Don't come back. Don't talk about the ferret clicky
4297400	4304600	Click that's not nice clicky. Yeah. Yeah, I know they've got an explicit tag clicky, but go away. Sorry about that Rob
4304600	4310440	No, that's that's quite. Okay. You know I'm thinking maybe click clicky in the ferret could get their own show that no one would listen
4310440	4312440	to no one
4313040	4315040	Except maybe Jamie
4316480	4322680	She's making pouty face at me all right bye Bobby bye clicky bye Rob go away click
4322680	4326920	All right, black boy in chat says I would totally listen to that show so there you have it
4327960	4333800	What exactly would clicky in the ferret talk about what do pens and ferrets have in common? I'm not sure
4334600	4340120	They're long. That's true as go to the phones. We have more calls. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
4341560	4347480	Hi, this is a deaf hello act-deaf. Hey good submission good effort in the challenge tonight
4347480	4351800	I'm sorry it didn't work out for you, but you know I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that
4351800	4357480	But it's tough. I asked this to 100 Matt kind of he did something similar to what you did
4357480	4361720	I think that might have been part of the problem, and he just I think he does radio stuff
4361720	4367160	So we had a slight advantage, but good for him. Yeah. Yeah, he did a way better job than me
4368040	4370960	But we still I hope that he can win
4371160	4375680	We still appreciate the effort and are feeling the love very much to what do we owe this call tonight act-deaf
4375680	4382840	Well basically I was going to congratulate Matt for winning and
4383560	4387680	Like I said, I hope that he gets all our
4388560	4390560	How do you say it?
4390560	4395560	support for him to win the old games calm a contest overall I
4397000	4399000	Though I hope he
4399840	4401600	he gives a
4401600	4407760	The console to Loki because I was going to do that if I won all you act-deaf was serious
4407760	4410000	He was going to give you the console if you want
4410000	4414640	And I would not have let him do that because that's a foolish thing to do I would have made him keep it
4414640	4418360	Not a foolish thing to do I would have been watching your mailbox when I see this big box
4418360	4421040	I mean from Mexico. I would have written died
4424640	4426640	Expired
4426680	4428680	That doesn't work by the way
4428680	4431520	Have you tried doing that to just try that with junk mail?
4432560	4438520	Deceased no, they don't believe it if I know hey, well someone was there to write deceased on it
4438520	4444920	So therefore the more junk is that all you want to say act-deaf day any anything going on in your gaming world this week?
4447080	4452360	Basically much, it's pretty much that I haven't been gaming that much. I have been working and
4452360	4460600	And other stuff, but I'm pretty looking forward to spacing by there's extreme. Oh, yes, man. I have I
4461120	4466480	Have seen some of the videos and and oh my god. That's awesome. It's an awesome game
4466480	4472720	I think it reminds me of rest. I played it for about three minutes, and it was an awesome three minutes
4472720	4477000	I definitely am gonna pick this game up on my PSP. It's it's it's got a great yes
4477000	4479600	It is on the ds2 yeah, I think I'm gonna get on PSP
4479600	4486080	Just just for the heck of it so and it's going to be pretty cheap. Also. It's not it's like $20 on GameStop
4486080	4487880	Yeah, I think it's 20 bucks
4487880	4490120	It's very it's cheap, and I think it'll be good
4490120	4495400	I will review the game in full a little later on as soon as we get our grubby little hands on it
4495480	4498680	So well act I was looking forward act F
4498680	4503440	take a break from making radio ads this week and definitely play some more games if you can and
4504280	4508480	We're gonna need your help so that we can get SSJ 100 Matt to win the contest at all games
4508480	4511680	So as soon as I know how how he can do that. We'll fill you in
4513000	4515720	Okay, all right. Thanks. All right. Take care, buddy
4517520	4520200	If you want to give us a call one eight seven seven game
4520360	4526560	Olr our username on Skype is orange lounge radio meanwhile. Do we have any other last-minute stories? Oh wait
4526560	4529440	No, just kidding. We have another call hi on orange lounge radio. Who's this?
4530040	4534480	Hey, it's DJ tired. Hey DJ Tyron. How are you doing good?
4534480	4539960	That was a fun Mario Kart match last night by the way. I don't remember most of it
4539960	4544400	What why not do you not remember me kicking your ass? I was a little
4545080	4552000	Drinky drinky you were drunk play Mario Kart online. Yeah, I just I just gotten home. I'm like what am I gonna do?
4552000	4553160	I don't wanna go to sleep yet
4553160	4558080	So I put popped in Mario Kart, and I was able to navigate the menu shoes perfectly fine
4558160	4561040	But once I got in the game it was it was all downhill from there
4561040	4564700	No, wonder you kept coming in last, and I was blaming it on the fact that you now
4564700	4568020	Did you know that we actually were broadcasting that whole thing on Justin TV?
4569840	4573240	Dude go to the Justin TV archives and look cuz the whole thing is broadcast
4573240	4577340	I'm totally making fun of everybody using the wheel because I'm like look the people winning
4577600	4583060	Using the wheel the people not winning. I mean the people winning not using we all the people not winning using the wheel
4583280	4584860	So that is so funny
4584860	4585320	I had no idea
4585320	4590520	Do it and you had no idea because we were actually like I was on just TV doing something else that I'd promised the listeners
4590520	4595920	last week. Somehow, in Justin TV chat, they were like, play Mario Kart, play Mario Kart.
4595920	4599720	So I went in there, logged into Mario Kart, and it was like me, Rama, and then Dark Tetsuya,
4599720	4603080	and then you joined out of nowhere. I was like, oh, Jimmy must have saw us on Justin
4603080	4604800	TV. That is so funny. So you were drinking.
4604800	4610040	Yeah. When you connect to Wi-Fi, if there's like one of your friends with an open room,
4610040	4614400	it has like a smiley face next to friends. And I was like, will that be?
4614400	4618300	I didn't know that. Okay, that's helpful. Wow, what a good case of timing, though. But
4618300	4621440	shame on you for drinking and driving. I know. It was bad.
4621440	4625200	But I guess if you're gonna do it, then you gotta do it in Mario Kart. I guess that's
4625200	4628120	the safest place to drink and drive. Exactly.
4628120	4631120	Nice. Awesome. Or GTA 4.
4631120	4633360	Huh? Or GTA 4.
4633360	4636320	So that's why you picked Rainbow Road, because I was like, oh god.
4636320	4640520	No, I did random. I did not want to play Rainbow Road. I hate that level so much.
4640520	4643880	Oh, okay. Okay. Alright. Because I was cursing you out when you picked it.
4643880	4648360	I could tell. Everyone was hating me at that point, and if there was voice chat, it wouldn't
4648360	4651200	have been very pretty. Yeah, maybe that's why Nintendo banned voice
4651200	4656160	chat, so it spares us like a drunken Jim. Anything? Did you call in to talk about something
4656160	4658200	else tonight, Jimmy? I totally derailed it to Mario Kart.
4658200	4660680	No, no, that was it. Oh, okay. You were calling to make excuses
4660680	4662360	for your drunken performance last night. Yep.
4662360	4666360	Alright, that's fine. Alright, well, we'll have to play a sober match sometime. Maybe
4666360	4671600	you can represent the OLR crew when we do our big epic battle with Bobby Black Wolf
4671600	4672600	later. Okay.
4672600	4675800	Alright. Take care, Jimmy. Hey, thanks for getting me on the show.
4675800	4679120	No problem. Bye. Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype
4679120	4683640	line tonight, because we went really long with the match game thing, and we want to
4683640	4686920	try to end it at a decent hour tonight. So, Loki, please finish up any other last minute
4686920	4693400	stories you might have tonight. Okay. Let's see here. Well, first off, let's
4693400	4699240	talk real quick. We mentioned a lot of stuff about Rock Band earlier. Apparently, well,
4699240	4702680	first off, they've got some new stuff coming out this week, of course. Hanging on Telephone
4702680	4707600	by Blondie, Train in Vain by The Clash, and Cool Thing by Sonic Youth. So, that's pretty
4707600	4713720	awesome. All going to be two bucks, or 160 Microsoft points.
4713720	4722240	There's also some, I guess, tracks on sale. All sorts of stuff between, I guess, now and
4722240	4730560	June 2nd. I guess two per week are going to be half price, or 80 Microsoft points. So,
4730560	4737860	I guess, this week there was Crush Crush Crush by Paramore, and Boston's Rock and Roll Band.
4737860	4744560	I guess, later this week, there was Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia, and Faith No More's
4744560	4752280	We Care A Lot, and Lynyrd Skynyrd's Gimme Three Steps. And then, I'm not sure what's
4752280	4760800	coming up later. Let me see here real quick. Next week, there's going to be Shockwave,
4760800	4767080	Black Tide, and Sugar Magnolia by Grateful Dead. And then, the week after that, We Care
4767080	4774840	A Lot, I guess Faith No More, and All the Small Things by Blink-182. And then, finally,
4774840	4780000	I guess, last week is going to be Gimme Three Steps by Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Dirty Little
4780000	4785460	Secret by All American Rejects. If you want more information, Major Nelson had a story
4785460	4793080	on it, so you can check that out. Half price. And, Activision, during their conference call,
4793080	4798440	there's going to be no new Tony Hawk game in 2008. However, they did say that there
4798440	4803240	was, I guess, kind of contradicting themselves a little bit, a new Tony Hawk game exclusive
4803240	4811120	to the DS this year, that's going to utilize new technology not seen on the DS. So, maybe
4811120	4817200	another sort of plug-in or something for the Game Boy Advance slot, kind of similar to
4817200	4823120	Guitar Hero on tour. I guess we'll have to see. This week, also, there's a ton of demos
4823120	4829000	being released on Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, Born Conspiracies on there, Haze
4829000	4834200	on the PlayStation 3, Grid, which you got to check out, awesome racing game that's on
4834200	4840760	both. And, next week, or actually, a few weeks from now, June 5th, there's going to be Battlefield
4840760	4847200	Bad Company, in case you didn't get into the beta. New Xbox Live arcade game coming in
4847200	4853340	June, Vigilante 8 Arcade, which, you know, Vigilante 8 was a fucking awesome game. It's
4853340	4858040	also going to have download content. No word when in June it's coming, but at least I have
4858040	4866720	a month nailed down. Gran Turismo shipped 50 million units total for the entire franchise,
4866720	4873920	and that's globally, so that's pretty awesome. Let's see here. This sounds pretty cool. I
4873920	4880800	didn't actually, well, I played a little bit of Namco X Capcom, or Cross Capcom, but now
4880800	4886880	there's a new game coming out called Cross Edge, and it's got characters from Capcom,
4886880	4894880	Nippon Ichi, Namco Bandai, Gust, and Idea Factory. It's going to be an RPG, including
4894880	4901200	characters from all sorts of different things. They have characters from Disgaea, Darkstalkers,
4901200	4909400	Artolico, I guess, all sorts of stuff. This is coming from Famitsu magazine, which has
4909400	4917240	some nifty screenshots for that. Looks like Morgan's in there, and Etna, and I'm not sure
4917240	4924960	who else. Oh, Donovan, and looks like, who else. Lots of people though. Looks pretty
4924960	4930160	awesome. I like AJ Mix's idea for a game in chat. Everyone cross everyone. I like that.
4930160	4934760	Me too. Now this is kind of neat, and remember I think a few weeks ago when we were trying
4934760	4942160	to show off Crisis Core, it really pissed me off, but thank God for the homebrew community.
4942160	4952480	On the PSP, there is a new homebrew update called FUSA Build 032. What it does is allows
4952480	4958240	people with custom firmwares to use the video out and use any sort of cord they want, so
4958240	4965060	whether it be a composite, component, S-video, or D-terminal, they can use it on their TV,
4965060	4972720	play games, and they have a whole bunch of other options for that. Something that should
4972720	4980960	have been done anyways in a firmware update, I think, but whatever. Let's see here. We've
4980960	4990560	got one more thing here. This is kind of funny. There's a, I guess this gaming device called
4990560	4996160	Bob that's being released, and what it is, is it's a way for parents, they would hook
4996160	5002000	it up to a console of their choice, and they can set time limits for the amount of games
5002000	5009000	that kids can play. So it kind of looks like a giant calculator, and it will shut the power
5009000	5016040	off after a certain amount of time, and it's password protected. So it's kind of neat.
5016040	5022600	And then finally, I have to show this to you, Rob. They're going to release this on cell
5022600	5028500	phone games from Gameloft. They're remaking the Oregon Trail. Nice. And it's done all
5028500	5034840	fancy-like, and I can totally see this coming to the DS at some point. Wow, it looks like
5034840	5040120	Oregon Trail does battle. That's kind of weird looking. Yeah. Interesting. All fancy-like,
5040120	5045240	but yeah, you can check it out. Hey look, as long as I can make a character named Jamie
5045240	5053920	and she dies of cholera. Heart. But that is it. All right. Hey, at least it wasn't dysentery
5053920	5063240	because dysentery is so cliche. All right. Anyhow. That is why I hope I catch malaria.
5063240	5066360	And I don't know, Jamie, you should check this out on Kotaku. They have the ultimate
5066360	5070420	in horse riding simulation. I just thought of Final Furlong when I saw it. It looks like
5070420	5076720	an actual horse. Hump a horse, the game. Yeehaw. And the person's even dressed up. Like a jockey.
5076720	5081200	Like a horse? No. Are they humping? A horse riding a horse. Oh my god, a horse riding
5081200	5087520	a horse. But a horse is a horse. Of course, of course. All right. That's going to do it
5087520	5091240	for- A horse riding horse? How can that be? That's going to do it for another week of
5091240	5095920	Orange Lounge Radio, but first we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5095920	5101920	Dark Soccer, your final thought? Reject false icons. But I have an addition to that now.
5101920	5110880	Think with your brain, not the TV guide. My final thought is reject the common cold. Loki.
5110880	5115640	Need to play more ranked. Granted, I thought of four multiplayer. Oh, and sorry for people
5115640	5122100	that see me online around 10 o'clock and 3 o'clock Pacific time. Yeah, because we do
5122100	5130200	our online inter-employee games, and I accidentally invited people sometimes to that, and I haven't
5130200	5136960	kicked them. Sorry, Jason51. Anyways, that's what's going on there. All right. So 10 a.m.
5136960	5141160	and 3 p.m. not good GTA times for Loki. Yeah, noon though. Sometimes we'll leave it open
5141160	5146000	during noon. All right. All right, that's going to do it for another week of Orange
5146000	5151240	Lounge Radio. My name is Rob Roberts. That's Dark Soccer. That's Loki, and we're out of
5151240	5154280	here for a week. Thank you guys so much for supporting Independent Radio. If you like
