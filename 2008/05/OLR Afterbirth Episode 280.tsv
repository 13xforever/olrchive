469	2712	By the way, this is part of the show, it's too hot to podcast, blah blah blah.
3452	7796	Loki has brought another edition of Secret Club tonight.
8597	15644	For those of you who don't know what Secret Club is, Secret Club is where we're going to tell you some secrets about things that will be happening in the game industry very soon.
15984	20769	However, there is a rule that goes with Secret Club and that is that you don't talk about Secret Club.
21349	23230	In other words, you're going to hear some things on here.
24210	30232	You don't say you heard them here because we've gotten in trouble over stuff before and we just don't care to have the limelight anymore.
30292	31493	It's really not that important to us.
31893	34114	So that being said, Secret Club.
34394	34954	Rules 1 and 2.
35214	38376	It's really juicy stuff that you've got to tell somebody.
38836	44458	So I know a lot of people were disappointed with Capcom not porting over Resident Evil 0 over here.
44498	46138	Only Japan's getting it.
46178	47499	Everyone liked Resident Evil 3.
48143	49264	for Wii and stuff.
49704	51426	Well, they are porting a game over.
51926	53128	It's not Resident Evil, though.
53608	55430	It's another game.
55990	58012	Also happens to have dead things running around.
59914	60554	January.
61815	63477	Dead Rising, coming through the Wii.
63871	65553	Bionic Commando Resident Evil 5 Street Fighter 4
84794	90078	and, of course, the latter ones being all on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
90238	91799	That's a weird month for Street Fighter 4.
91859	92380	January?
92920	93280	Yeah.
93400	98784	Well, there's another... I read another story, though, from Juice Francis saying the same thing.
98804	101106	They said a winter release for it, so it fits.
102186	102527	All right.
103367	104328	Is that it for Secret Club?
104348	106990	It's a good spot to put it, I mean, because there's something that comes out in January.
107370	107830	That's it.
108571	108871	All right.
109051	111753	We're going to do something very special now, and I'm going to leave.
112434	112974	I'm leaving...
113736	119318	I'm running to the store because we're going to do cake and I need to get some plates and some forks and all that good stuff and I need some other stuff myself.
119698	124259	So the store happens to be just down the street and around the corner.
124599	127140	So I should be back in no more than 10 minutes.
127700	129501	So are you guys going to time me how long I'm gone?
130655	133017	We have exactly 10 minutes to run the show into the ground.
133037	135980	In the meantime, you guys are going to run the show.
136420	137581	Talk about whatever you want.
137961	138602	Fill time.
138982	139943	Interact with chatters.
140303	141925	Take off your top for Justin TV.
142185	142725	Who cares?
143706	144247	Have fun.
144387	145268	I'll flash my cleavage.
145468	147409	Is this the race?
147450	148030	In my mind.
148050	150092	Okay, so somebody's got to say on your mark, get set, go.
150112	150472	Okay, ready?
150492	154936	Ready, set, go.
154956	157178	He's going to get in a car accident and die.
158376	159197	That's gonna be sad.
159217	160278	Timer is running.
160298	162840	Maybe we won't be able to do a show next week because he'll be dead.
163080	165682	I don't want to sit in Rob's chair, but I want to fuck up his computer.
166763	168704	Rob, I'm screaming with your computer!
169365	170025	Can't hear you.
170065	170986	The window's closed.
171347	173328	I can hear him running through his car.
173528	179273	You hear that, everybody?
179393	181695	That's Rob's alarm that doesn't do any good.
183156	183596	He's running.
184777	184978	Uh-oh.
187093	188954	Don't understand, why does he not have plates?
189175	191036	That's what I said, isn't that what I said?
191456	196240	It's like, I offered to wash the plates.
196821	197381	And yet?
197401	199863	I was like, I'm gonna go buy some.
199943	202785	So that my cosplayer has some pretty awesome cleavage.
204567	205908	You've gotta have boobs.
206849	207769	Did Rob save Part B?
209371	209771	I don't know.
210091	214315	I believe I saw him save Part B. Let's close the computer down and guess.
216718	217819	Oh shit, my mic was off.
218379	220060	I can't be a host without a mic.
220180	220540	Oh no.
220740	222641	Osfer told me to say boob ten times.
222721	223402	So I'm going to say it.
223462	223722	Ready?
225143	226504	Boob ten times on air.
226864	227184	XD.
228004	229265	Har har har.
229745	230346	That's what he said.
231847	235929	Now I need to add a thread for Trendeth Auto.
236659	238982	in the Ola Army thing.
239382	240383	I've been playing a few people.
240663	241324	It's been fun.
241584	244027	But most of the time I get invited to games and no one knows who I am.
245188	247610	Just a reminder for Ola Army people.
249272	251114	I believe there is a group for Steam.
251134	253996	I believe there also is a clan on Xfire.
254237	255038	Mike, want to join it?
255278	255538	Drew.
255698	257160	Because it's getting kind of lonely.
257620	258401	Pass the mic over.
260492	262214	Pass the mic over.
262314	262954	I like the mic.
263575	266597	You may like it, but women have precedence because we have boobs.
267779	268059	Awesome.
268079	268819	You know what I'm going to do?
268839	270201	You can go to the bathroom.
270221	271762	I'm going to play a game.
273323	273944	Fix it.
274084	276486	We are hijacking the afterbirth officially.
276787	277447	Fix it.
277467	278788	I play Rob.
279369	279889	Oh, my God.
279949	281170	It's because Rob always does this.
281691	282251	Wait, wait, wait.
282271	282492	Hold on.
282512	282572	No.
295399	296980	This is what happens when women run a show.
297201	298121	Men are hopeless.
300703	304526	We've come to hijack the afterbirth and talk about comics.
304747	305587	Yay, comics!
305847	307028	We hate the Skrulls!
307289	308009	Skrulls suck.
308309	309611	They suck so bad.
310992	311592	And they suck.
312513	313253	They do suck.
313914	314795	And they turn green.
315115	315836	Well, they are green.
315916	317117	But they turn into other people.
317437	318478	They turn into other people.
318558	320980	And that sucks, and we don't know who's actually a Skrull.
321340	323562	For all we know, half the chatroom can be Skrulls.
325060	327941	Andrew could be a Skrull, but we wouldn't know the difference even if he did turn green.
328461	330161	I love Marvel, but Marvel hates me.
332182	333522	This show makes me turn green.
334402	335022	Skrull!
341024	347805	Okay, Actdeft protests and Toshin protests, and a bunch of people said that they're not Skrulls, so that means they are.
349066	352187	You just want us to... If you say you aren't a Skrull, you are a Skrull.
352407	353747	Do they weigh less than a duck?
356380	357421	I mean, we can find out.
358661	359482	And don't eat us.
360082	361102	Because you can't become us.
362303	363323	Wait, different universe.
363604	363884	Sorry.
366865	369266	And Cheeseburger, if you have to ask, it means you are one.
372908	374289	Yes, the Hulk does turn green.
374449	375730	Actually, the Hulk turns gray.
377130	377551	And red.
380432	383774	And in one universe, he eats people's brains.
384841	386523	and Poops the Mount.
389205	391567	I just thought it was intensely hilarious that they had to say it was poo.
392348	394189	Because it had alien matter in it.
394369	396031	No, no, it had alien rubber bands in it.
398133	401535	You know not what you're talking about unless you read the comics in my bathroom.
403958	405559	I keep comics in my bathroom, everybody.
405799	406560	Die, monster.
406600	407641	You don't belong in this world.
407661	409122	I love comics in her bathroom.
409362	412345	Okay, the comics in my bathroom right now have three volumes of The Ultimates.
413820	415341	I have a Spider-Man one.
415381	417123	I'm sorry for you.
417143	418283	I'm sorry, Ultimates, why?
418644	420645	Exiles, because it's awesome and you suck.
420725	421586	Why God, why?
423547	424228	Can I kill him?
424308	432194	Ultimates Volume 1 and 2, you're actually not supposed to like it, supposedly, if you like Marvel, but it's actually better written than the actual Avengers.
432294	433335	Ha ha ha, I said it.
433675	435196	See how easily provoked Jamie is?
436277	438158	I actually have nothing against the Ultimates series.
439539	441481	I have everything against you, though, so it's okay.
442651	443632	I know, I know
462646	463246	Spoilers Spoilers
491795	494438	Rob has now been gone for 5 minutes and 45 seconds.
498042	499604	Five minutes have elapsed.
504065	508046	Another good comic this week was X-Men Divided We Stand No.
508066	517069	2, which is one of the Messiah Complex comics dealing with the X-Men, featuring Beast, who is my favorite.
517889	519290	That's what you were reading earlier, wasn't it?
519310	520450	Yeah, that's what I was reading earlier.
520630	528052	I have downloaded it and have yet to read it, because I was reading Mighty Avengers and reading this Silent Hill series that I'm waiting on to be finished.
528293	529533	How was your Silent Hill comic?
529873	539020	My Silent Hill comic was very disturbing and it was about a contract killer who ran off with his boss's wife to Silent Hill!
539761	540882	Dun dun dun!
540942	542163	And we know what happens.
542223	546106	If you want to go to the best place ever, you want to run off to Silent Hill.
546346	548207	You'll have a killer good time.
549669	551130	Ha ha.
551250	553131	Pyramid Head goes faster at night.
554172	555914	Uh, no.
557675	558896	He has to drag around that great knife.
559642	560883	So how was Mighty Avengers?
561763	563504	Mighty Avengers was very interesting.
563644	565005	It was scrolltastic, wasn't it?
565105	569747	It was more scrolltastic, but it was more or less Bob is Nuts, the comic.
570047	571407	Yeah, basically.
573068	580852	Another good comic that is coming to trade paperback soon, I believe, is the Captain Marvel short series.
582248	601040	Anybody who is into classic Marvel knows that Captain Marvel died of cancer many, many years ago but they brought him back and I know that sounds sucky and it actually has to do with this whole secret invasion thing but the storyline was fairly decent and the art is very good and it's definitely worth checking out once it comes out in a trade paperback.
603682	605964	I've been told to say something I can't normally say around Rob.
606264	606504	Okay.
608683	611725	I normally say whatever the fuck I want around Rob, so... I was gonna say.
611845	616507	Maybe, um... What's something that really grosses Rob out?
617668	618808	Heterosexual sex.
621990	622650	There, I said it.
622890	623711	He likes boobies.
625472	626412	All men like boobies.
626512	627653	It doesn't matter if they're gay.
627973	628273	Yeah.
629094	633656	I remember one time at Disneyland... What?
639168	640429	He only sucks if you pay him.
642731	643812	Only if you're female, sorry.
645114	646415	La la la la la la la.
647216	648016	La li lu la lo.
648256	650178	Osprey suggested that I say vagina.
651519	652720	I can say that around Rob, though.
652760	654162	We saw Margaret Cho, hi.
657426	660668	This is a woman whose part of her stand-up comedy was about her period.
661548	662849	So, no, that doesn't work.
664550	665431	I like what she said, though.
665451	668252	She said that if Richard Pryor had a period, he would talk about it.
668793	670033	Everyone, hare hare yukai.
670874	671114	Now.
672335	674556	We are not housing a hare hare yukai.
675136	675557	Why not?
676417	677638	Because I'm sitting down.
678138	685583	You should put the webcam thingy on that and do some stuff that we can stop being comic book dorks.
688666	689867	Hot Laptop is hot.
689947	691748	Yes, I know what Rob doesn't like.
692809	694330	Rob doesn't like looking at girls' butts.
697292	698133	But he likes that song.
699454	699674	Right?
700675	700915	Yes.
701935	703276	Nine minutes have elapsed.
705538	705978	You know what?
706899	707539	Rob lied to us.
708840	709781	He lied to me.
711062	712203	He's never coming back.
712223	712923	The cake is a lie.
717219	721542	Give them that it takes five minutes to get to the aforementioned store.
722283	723543	And then you have to go in and get plates.
724004	725144	And then you have to pay for plates.
725485	726165	You know what we should do?
726205	729207	We should go grab the plates out of the cupboard and go ahead and serve out some cake.
730428	731709	And go, guess what, Rob?
732449	733350	You know what I bet he's doing?
733810	734011	What?
734031	735291	I bet he's buying a present.
736192	736312	Oh.
737533	740215	He's getting you a Walmart gift card.
740811	745734	I should have told them to buy candles and then you could all sing me happy birthday and I could... I'm doing it right now.
745754	755979	Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, time.
756840	758541	My mommy just texted it to me.
758981	759982	What'd your mom have to say?
760242	761642	Happy Memorial Day tomorrow.
762783	763864	I'm saying thanks, mommy.
764544	766045	Happy my birthday weekend.
768154	770716	And happy DJ Ranma S birthday weekend.
771457	772017	Time!
774460	779724	And happy Lenny Kravitz birthday weekend, even though I'm not really into any of his music.
780265	781086	Rob, you're late.
785069	788953	Trainwreck-a-rama, we has wrecks.
790954	791515	Metal Gear?
800637	801538	I told Rob to get candles.
804444	805105	Read it, read it, read it.
805125	805947	I told Rob to get bent.
808715	812978	There is a poem on my LJ from one of my friends, and it is called Love.
813939	822225	It's the wonderful love of a beautiful maid, the love of a staunch true man, the love of a baby unafraid have existed since time began.
822885	832252	But the greatest of loves, the quintessence of loves, even greater than that of a mother, is the tender, passionate, infinite love of one drunken marine for another.
833888	834628	That's fantastic.
835048	836969	Rob is late, late, late, late.
837189	838929	Rob is late, late, late, late.
839209	840109	Rob is late.
840129	841769	11 minutes, 25 seconds.
842250	842550	Fired!
842570	846470	I didn't get your text until I was pulling in the driveway.
846570	847691	You're a butt.
847831	848331	I'm sorry.
848371	848751	Fired.
848971	851891	You know, Rob, I could, we could have used the dishes.
851911	853572	It's all good.
853692	855152	And I would have loaded the dishwasher.
857072	860193	But then you would have had to have been here to, like, clean the dishes.
860834	862974	I got some pretzels and chips for me.
863074	865775	And look, Tris gets redesigned their package.
865855	866575	Isn't that something?
870876	872496	So what did I miss?
875637	877237	Rob, you missed the hurricane.
877617	880398	It came in, it rocked us like a hurricane, and then it left.
881498	881738	Yes.
882778	884298	Thank you for the scorpions reference.
887159	887619	Anytime.
892860	895082	I want to know what the hell my mom is doing up at 11.30.
896763	898084	She doesn't have to work tomorrow.
898204	898564	Rob!
898664	899205	It's a holiday.
899225	899825	Call my mother.
901466	901907	Right now?
902007	902547	Yes, right now.
904268	906210	Okay.
906230	909532	I don't have a mic, so I'm just... Do you want your mic back?
910192	910433	Okay.
911758	912819	I'll pretend to be Rob.
913839	914319	I'm Rob.
914339	915540	This is better than a drunk show.
915680	916881	I have fabulous hair.
917301	917641	Fuck.
917721	919442	And I'm wearing a nice shirt.
919482	921483	I'm getting my mom's phone number, so hold on for a second.
921563	924224	And I am dialing Jamie's mom on Skype.
924905	925225	No.
926285	926546	Rob.
927566	928366	Oh, no, no, no, no.
928507	928767	It's safe.
928787	929107	Reminder.
929307	929687	It's safe.
930307	930528	Here.
930868	932749	Ladies and gentlemen, Part B is safe.
932769	933309	So shut up.
933969	934570	Okay, mobile?
934690	934830	Yeah.
934890	935590	Okay, here we go.
937151	938211	You've called my mom before.
938231	938892	Give him a mic.
938912	939252	Give him a mic.
955656	956216	I can't hear it.
956236	957037	It's not ringing.
957057	957917	It's connecting still.
968545	968785	Hello?
969005	969506	Hi, Mom.
970546	971727	Hi.
971787	973749	Since you texted me, I thought it was okay to call you.
974798	975619	Yeah, I'm still up.
976079	976600	Guess what?
977621	977841	What?
977901	980103	You're live on Orange Sounds Radio again.
981344	981884	Oh, boy.
982545	984266	And a lot more people are listening now.
984406	985447	Hi, Jamie's mom.
986628	987249	Hello.
987529	988210	That's Drew.
989010	989671	And Tiara's here.
990372	990932	Hi, Mom.
991833	994235	Hey, Tiara.
994295	997578	How are y'all doing out there in sunny California?
997798	998659	It is nighttime.
1000239	1000919	The night is young.
1000979	1003200	I thought it was sunny all the time in California.
1003520	1005520	No, that's only on movie sets.
1006880	1008021	Or if you're on acid.
1010781	1012722	And you remember Rob, right?
1013582	1014242	Yes, I do.
1014282	1014762	Hey, Rob.
1014802	1015622	Hi, how are you?
1016923	1018223	I'm fine.
1018263	1018663	How are you?
1018743	1018943	Good.
1018963	1020583	We've got lots of comments from chat.
1020643	1023004	We have Siren says, Hi, Jamie's mom.
1023044	1024284	Misty says, Hi, Jamie's mom.
1024364	1025324	Gold Banjo says, Hi.
1026084	1028405	Ty Rules says, Tell her Ty Rules loves her.
1030472	1035735	We keep our chat room patched in during the show, so everyone is saying hi.
1036936	1037837	Well, that's very cool.
1037877	1039358	I was feeling kind of lonely.
1040459	1042360	Everybody loves my mom.
1043121	1044562	Happy Memorial Day, Mommy.
1045222	1055350	She named her child after the... Yeah, okay, I have to tell you, because everyone who listens to the show knows me as Jamie Summers, and that's in tribute to you naming me after the Bionic Woman.
1056390	1056891	Oh, yeah, yeah.
1058991	1061732	Do they know that a little six-year-old girl picked out that name?
1061792	1065294	Because she thought it'd be very cool to name you a demonic woman?
1066134	1067955	I've told this story online before.
1067975	1069315	I'm just glad you didn't name me Erica.
1071476	1072837	But after Erica Strada?
1073077	1074617	You said you were going to name me Erica.
1075898	1078419	I know, and I wanted to, but Granddaddy couldn't say it.
1078679	1081240	And Papa got pissed off that you named me Erica.
1081781	1083743	Jamie, and he called me Maury.
1084403	1089027	Just so you know, Akuma JP says hello from Japan to Jamie's mom.
1089167	1089947	Oh, really?
1090888	1094791	And Tigerclaw wants you to tell an embarrassing story, but I'm vetoing that request.
1096112	1100195	Because you've already told the condensation story, and you've already told the projectile pooping story.
1101817	1102837	Both were wonderful.
1102857	1104839	You don't want me to tell that again?
1105479	1106160	No!
1106180	1109863	Oh, and Foodie Monster says hi from Argentina.
1111632	1113113	You want to talk about where it's sitting all the time.
1114054	1115134	From Argentina.
1115254	1117495	Yeah, we have listeners from all over the world.
1118856	1119256	Wow.
1119636	1121758	And Actdeft says hi from Mexico.
1123839	1125800	I'm sorry, you kind of echoed a little bit.
1127501	1130662	Well, one of our listeners, Actdeft, says hi from Mexico.
1132183	1132323	Oh.
1133284	1135565	And Nogal Banjo Summers is not my real last name.
1136058	1138999	You know, we use mysterious last names on air so you can't stalk us.
1139300	1140600	Yeah.
1140620	1144522	But you can tell a story as long as it has nothing to do with me being naked.
1146623	1151385	She has to think.
1151465	1153887	I have to think about that.
1155628	1157949	Can I say what you used to call the beach area?
1158309	1158829	Please do.
1160530	1161030	The what?
1161650	1162011	The beach?
1162031	1163011	The beach area.
1163231	1163511	What?
1164392	1164712	Golf?
1165510	1178179	I was going to tell you, the new kids on the block are getting back together.
1178559	1180180	Mom, mom, mom.
1180220	1184643	This is the one who bought me bed sheets and curtains, okay?
1184664	1187245	The new kids on the block, everything.
1187425	1189607	Bedspread, pillowcases, blankets.
1190722	1191282	Really?
1191643	1194884	I've told you this myself, Rob.
1195004	1196245	I must have forgot somehow.
1196265	1197045	That's amazing.
1197485	1199987	But you want to know what's awful?
1200107	1200687	No, no, no.
1201247	1202688	And if you laugh, I kill you.
1203288	1203668	Slowly.
1203868	1207690	And then as soon as she got it all, she said, I don't like this anymore.
1209971	1210631	Of course.
1210651	1211612	You know what?
1212194	1215856	And one time she had Michael Jackson poster over her bed.
1216816	1219197	I had the one of him in the yellow sweater vest.
1219577	1223479	The yellow sweater vest that matched her bedroom because her bedroom was yellow and white.
1223539	1224279	That's hardcore.
1227461	1229582	I think I have a picture of that one.
1230522	1232203	You also put the Care Bears on my wall.
1232223	1232883	No, not Care Bears.
1240750	1243273	Rainbow Bright, right?
1243913	1245034	Yeah, Rainbow Bright.
1245114	1246055	Yes, Rainbow Bright.
1246595	1250398	You also had, what's that big-headed doll?
1251279	1251940	Cabbage Patch.
1252680	1254042	Yeah, I had Cabbage Patch dolls.
1254862	1263189	That I stood in line for several hours with every other dumb mother in the world getting a Cabbage Patch doll that you didn't like.
1263590	1264610	I liked her.
1264630	1266312	You got me the one with brown hair, right?
1267353	1267573	Yeah.
1267593	1267673	Yeah.
1268484	1270185	I liked her because she was like, she was like me.
1270225	1274327	I searched and searched for one that, you know, would be perfect for you.
1276548	1278850	And you had Cadvics Patch bedroom shoes.
1280471	1281071	You remember those?
1281851	1283312	Yes, I have.
1283332	1285533	They were pink and they had the heads on them.
1286134	1286734	Mm-hmm.
1288358	1292001	Can you not picture Jamie walking around with cabbage-packed bedroom shoes on?
1292321	1294603	Yeah, but I get to tell an embarrassing story about Matthew.
1295404	1297866	How we used to dress him up in my doll dress with the bonnet.
1298627	1300788	No, you used to dress him up.
1301529	1301849	I know.
1302289	1305312	You used to dress him up like he was a big baby doll.
1305852	1306833	I know, it was great.
1306893	1307634	I've got pictures.
1308735	1312918	And we used to put Phillip in blue shorts and the red shirt and put my five-year-old hat on him.
1314259	1315380	Yep, yep.
1316229	1321931	I was going to tell you, Mom, you're going to laugh and I had to do it just because I downloaded the New Kids on the Block single.
1323172	1323752	You what now?
1323892	1326173	I downloaded the New Kids on the Block single on iTunes.
1327934	1328714	You jumbled it?
1328914	1329515	Downloaded.
1330475	1330955	Oh, download.
1330975	1332276	I'm sorry, you're kind of echoey.
1332556	1333636	It's because we got microphones.
1333977	1334617	Skype is weird.
1335557	1339019	It's that we're using a program through the computer to call you.
1340679	1344021	Hey, don't forget to email or text your brother.
1344665	1347366	and Happy Memorial Day.
1347386	1351727	Since he served five years in our military.
1351947	1353587	Mama, email me his phone number, okay?
1353607	1356128	Because he changed his phone since I had it last.
1357288	1358569	I thought you got Matt one.
1359349	1361649	No, I got Matt, I think.
1361889	1363610	Oh, he doesn't have his anymore.
1364390	1364570	Yeah.
1364590	1365270	Things change.
1365550	1366831	You know Phillips and Huntsville?
1367091	1367291	Yes.
1368371	1370193	We're telling everybody our family history.
1370433	1372314	So you can go to Huntsville and look for Phillip.
1373015	1375276	I won't give his last name to protect the guilty.
1375436	1377738	At Ruby Tuesdays.
1377758	1379820	Yeah, my brother is a waiter at Ruby Tuesdays.
1380480	1381621	And a bartender.
1382282	1383162	Oh, he's a bartender now.
1384503	1385044	And a waiter.
1385244	1385924	He does both.
1386144	1387786	Mama, can I say bad language around you?
1389207	1390368	Well, I had news before.
1391602	1394364	I think at your age, which I'm not going to say.
1395064	1401868	Find my brother, his name is Phillip, at a Ruby Tuesdays in Huntsville and order an Adios motherfucker and say his sister said so.
1404410	1405551	And by the way, they're really nasty.
1406251	1408412	Does everybody know that your brother was in the Marines?
1409293	1409953	I have said so.
1410053	1414556	My brother was in the Marines and I told the story about how he chased everybody out of his tent with his stinky feet.
1415476	1415857	Oh yeah.
1416897	1417698	Yes he did.
1418700	1419681	That was his defense.
1419761	1423544	If the bad guys ever came in there, he would just take his boots off.
1424085	1424905	It probably worked.
1425245	1426046	It might work, yeah.
1426066	1428408	Phil had stinky feet when he was little, okay?
1428808	1430350	He stank all the time, his feet did.
1430710	1431751	It was a stink bomb.
1432371	1437235	Well, Mommy, Mother Deer, we have to let you go.
1438196	1438577	Okay.
1438897	1439798	Because we have to eat cake.
1439838	1439938	Cake.
1442592	1444173	Okay, well, AK can have fun.
1444313	1444753	Be happy.
1445254	1446735	Okay, and email me Phillip's stuff.
1446915	1448116	I'm glad we could talk to you.
1448436	1448956	Take care.
1449076	1450457	Well, you too.
1450517	1451558	And the listeners love you.
1451578	1452058	Y'all have fun tomorrow.
1453099	1453479	Do what?
1453679	1454640	The listeners love you.
1455360	1457261	Everybody in Alabama harass my brother.
1459543	1460043	Bye.
1460063	1460383	Bye.
1460423	1460863	Love you, Mom.
1460883	1461264	Take care.
1461784	1462284	Love you.
1464025	1464426	Love you too.
1467383	1467963	There you have it.
1468343	1469043	That's Mommy.
1469564	1470124	That was fun.
1470484	1473905	My mom now has her second appearance on the show.
1474825	1475265	That was fun.
1475565	1475845	Yeah.
1476005	1477105	My mom's probably in bed.
1477145	1478486	If I call her, we're getting smacked.
1478726	1480366	We've got to get to the cage match, too, folks.
1480386	1484767	We've got to wrap up and get to the cage match.
1485167	1486968	So what did I miss while I was gone, anyway?
1487268	1490289	We hijacked the afterbirth and talked about comics.
1490629	1490909	Oh, fun.
1490949	1491089	Okay.
1491809	1494951	Alright, song number one won two weeks ago.
1495071	1497652	It was Diddy from a band called Ladytron.
1497792	1500653	I love Ladytron, and apparently you do too, because you voted it the winner.
1500693	1501854	Here it is, song number one.
1502254	1504215	Last week's Cage Match winner was Ghosts.
1504575	1505896	Remember, you only get to hear a clip of it.
1506796	1508737	Again, you've got to be in chat to vote for your favorite.
1508977	1514280	You know what, just ask someone in chat how it works if you really don't know, because I don't feel like explaining it, because I'm going to go help with cake.
1526147	1527231	Thanks for watching!
1571595	1572896	And there's a ghost in me
1592025	1597828	That was song number one, Lady Tron, with Ghost, the winner from the holdover from the May 11th show, last time we were here.
1598148	1599769	All right, let's get into some new songs tonight.
1599809	1601450	DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?
1601690	1602690	Whatever Tiara picked.
1603210	1604691	Tiara, what did you pick for us tonight?
1606052	1610054	It's my birthday, so we're going to listen to The Beatles' Birthday.
1610894	1611694	All right, why not?
1611975	1613315	A little bit of classic rock.
1613675	1614316	The Beatles.
1614496	1616477	Hey, I've been with Paul McCartney before.
1617037	1618299	That's true, we did have Paul McCartney before.
1618319	1618839	All right, here we go.
1618859	1619700	Some classic rock.
1620161	1621722	The Beatles with Birthday.
1621782	1621983	Enjoy.
1786872	1791787	Song number two in tonight's cage match, a little bit of classic... Jamie, you just broke the can.
1792289	1794034	A little bit of classic stuff, I'll fix it.
1795308	1801489	A little bit of classic rock with The Beatles and Birthday.
1802069	1803109	You say it's your birthday.
1803169	1803869	What do you say?
1804050	1805070	What would you rank that song?
1805190	1805890	We'll start with Tiara.
1805930	1807270	We'll just work our way around in a circle.
1807410	1808030	Tiara.
1808610	1809230	It's The Beatles.
1810031	1811451	It's White Album.
1811511	1812371	It's classic rock.
1813531	1814831	It gets a 10.
1814951	1816352	A 10 from Tiara, DarkSakura.
1816972	1817372	It gets a 10.
1817572	1819092	It gets Tiara's heads up.
1819692	1821672	That song still holds up very well today.
1821813	1822773	I give it an 8.5.
1822853	1822933	Drew.
1825069	1827011	It gets a 10 because Tiara said so.
1827871	1833696	Loki, I'm not buying into this whole Tiara says thing, so it gets an average 6 from me.
1834337	1836258	Alright, because it's an average song.
1836278	1840622	Alright, Loki, then what pray towel did you bring to the listening public today in song number 3?
1840962	1843925	I picked a song by a group called Methods of Mayhem.
1844305	1848068	You may not recognize this group, but it's actually Tommy Lee, um,
1850731	1856734	producing music that's unlike Tommy Lee, but it's a rock rap group, but trust me, the song's pretty good.
1856794	1858876	So the song's called Crash.
1859936	1860557	All right, here it is.
1860577	1864939	Song number three in the cage match, your last song tonight, Methods of Mayhem with Crash.
1865619	1868161	Enjoy, or don't, you decide.
1868261	1868501	Crash.
1921703	1922638	and all the rest.
1961288	1965452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2021289	2042610	Kiss the ground We're going too fast, we're going too fast Ain't no way that it's me, we're never gonna last We're going too fast, we're going trash I took the risk, so what the hell did you expect?
2065041	2076904	Welcome back to Orange Line Straight Outta the Cage Mesh.
2076924	2078884	That was Methods of Mayhem with Crash.
2079304	2081225	Oh, the things that go on in studio when you're not here.
2081765	2082825	All right, let's see.
2082865	2084225	Let's see what you guys thought of that.
2084565	2087246	Was that song mayhem, or did you just want to crash it apart?
2087306	2087626	I don't know.
2087866	2088306	Tiara.
2088326	2091407	This song is going nowhere.
2091467	2092267	I give it a six.
2093584	2094325	DarkSakura.
2095325	2096006	I kind of like it.
2096046	2096826	It's seven and a half.
2097727	2098968	The bass drum was awesome.
2099148	2099368	Eight.
2099808	2100228	Drew.
2102010	2104811	I'll give it a five.
2105252	2105552	All right.
2106052	2108414	Well, that's far from what you were saying, Loki.
2108674	2109054	Nine.
2109775	2110155	Nine.
2110675	2110835	No.
2110856	2111696	All right.
2112437	2113677	Nine is in the number nine.
2114178	2114518	All right.
2114558	2117420	Let's recap the song so you can vote for it tonight.
2117680	2118240	Okay.
2119400	2121321	And I'll take some FUs until I say stop!
2121601	2122821	Alright, here we go.
2123882	2124222	Here it is.
2125622	2128343	Song number one you can vote for tonight is Ladytron with Ghosts.
2133705	2137527	Song number two you can vote for tonight is The Beatles with Birthday.

2159420	2163161	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
2163641	2171424	And in the meantime, we will get to the FUs of the week, which I hope have already started to come in because we've had to fill enough time tonight.
2172719	2174361	Yes, I've got one arrive already Um, I've got one
2188686	2190548	More will probably come in as you start to read the one.
2190849	2196395	Osfer says F you to Skye for missing his time limit, but then again it doesn't matter because it was fun while he was gone.
2197256	2198017	What are you trying to say?
2198037	2199499	This show's more fun without me here?
2199519	2202182	Dude, I freaking adore Osfer, okay?
2202703	2205125	Osfer is, like, rad.
2206124	2207446	Ossifer is great.
2207586	2209268	Ossifer is great.
2209508	2214174	But it better be in a nice way that you love my mommy.
2214194	2215696	I love my mommy too.
2216057	2221083	Ranma, F you to people who missed out on the debauchery of my 30th last night.
2221363	2222304	You poor bastards.
2222685	2224127	Hey, that would be us.
2224227	2224768	I missed out.
2225817	2230301	Maybe that should be amended to those who are in a position to attend, yet did not.
2230321	2233103	Yes, I hereby void Ranma's FU, Nolan Void.
2233483	2236726	Actually, I amend it, but with another proposal.
2237806	2238847	Everyone four, aye.
2240328	2240889	Nay.
2241729	2242330	No amending.
2244972	2246193	Oh, fine, I don't care.
2246713	2247694	As you two rods may.
2248815	2250116	By power of estrogen.
2252878	2253739	Sim are FUs.
2255794	2257355	And he said, I made it.
2258796	2261878	More FUs, not more breaking of my computer.
2262919	2263379	FUs.
2263419	2265060	My FU goes to these forks.
2265720	2266341	Cheeseburger.
2266521	2268522	Fork you.
2268542	2269323	Okay, you know what?
2269383	2278949	I'm not, if you keep, okay, he says FU to me not reading an email that he sent six weeks ago, and I'm telling you this, it's gone, like I told you last time, like I told you earlier today.
2279229	2282231	The email you sent six weeks ago is gone.
2285709	2288750	If you want an email read, send another email.
2289730	2290351	And we'll see.
2290831	2291511	And we'll see.
2292371	2295512	I skipped a lot of emails, okay?
2295932	2303355	Just because I passed yours up once or twice or three times does not mean that I hate you.
2303955	2307556	I didn't have time to read it.
2310714	2313560	Jamie is the goddamn Batman.
2313861	2315063	And she hates chocolate.
2315103	2316346	I am the goddamn Batman.
2316406	2317167	I like chocolate.
2317809	2319472	I am the goddamn chocolate Batman.
2323933	2327415	Someone save Rob saying that, please.
2331157	2332918	I don't think anyone's running a recording right now.
2332938	2333458	You're screwed.
2333718	2337060	Actdeft says, Shut up.
2337900	2340061	Actdeft says, F you to not having money.
2340361	2341442	By the way, your mom rocks.
2341582	2342022	I know.
2342042	2343943	She rocks me a lot more now that I've grown up.
2345313	2354798	When I was growing up, though, my mom always used to be like, You get back here in your room, and you get it clean, and I'll take your TV away!
2354839	2356559	My mind went straight to the gutter, too.
2356740	2358100	My mind is the gutter.
2358160	2362463	I'd be like, Mama, you can't take my TV away because Daddy got that for me, and you taking it would be theft.
2363343	2363984	I was a brat.
2365044	2371088	So to have my mom be as cool as she is now with me being such an ungrateful little brat, my mom is super awesome.
2372341	2383368	Rob, I don't think you can really let your mind go to the gutter about Jamie's mom being a screamer when you just told everybody you're the chocolate Batman.
2385770	2386470	Touche.
2388211	2392274	Tyrell says F you to DK Bungos that waste... Ah, fuck, someone's recording.
2393115	2393295	Fuck.
2395908	2398931	Okay, if you've got the whole conversation with my mom, save it for me.
2399071	2400612	Okay, I'll give you my email address later.
2400652	2403855	By the way, according to Ossifer, this is seriously the best afterbirth ever.
2403875	2405576	This is long, it's going on forever.
2405596	2407117	So busted right?
2407157	2411441	Tyrol says, F you to DK Bungos that waste space on my shelf and attract spiders.
2412281	2415504	You are the best.
2415524	2417486	Sauce is the best guest ever.
2418106	2421229	Roboboy430 says, F you to Voldemort.
2429561	2431222	The males are having a huddle.
2436005	2437686	Believe it or not, it's not about you.
2437706	2440547	Rob is being the chocolate Batman.
2444349	2446530	What exactly is the chocolate Batman?
2446550	2447131	I don't even know.
2447211	2447731	I don't know.
2447771	2449672	You said that's you, so why don't you tell us?
2449772	2450132	All right.
2450152	2451433	All right.
2452455	2453075	Kill the music.
2453415	2454376	These FUs are over.
2454576	2455056	Stop!
2455416	2456156	No more FUs.
2456476	2456737	All right.
2457197	2458657	How about a cage match wiener?
2460558	2462559	Somebody weaned the cage match tonight.
2462919	2463759	It's the cage match wiener.
2463779	2464359	Like a babe in a tit?
2465300	2465560	What?
2465760	2466080	Nothing.
2467100	2469741	And the cage match winner is actually a close vote tonight between all three songs.
2469841	2470341	What, what?
2475223	2475884	Bass drum.
2476724	2476824	One.
2478357	2483379	Maybe doing Grover impressions on Justin TV for some weird reason.
2483739	2487120	Alright, we are finally ready to put the nail in the coffin of this damn show.
2487180	2488000	Yay!
2491141	2491441	Alright.
2492362	2494082	It's now 1am on the East Coast.
2496363	2496663	Alright.
2497386	2503409	I know, YouTube has been so slow on my computer lately, but of course everybody has been leeching bandwidth, so that's what happens.
2503789	2505930	That's alright, it'll finish before we're done.
2506270	2508531	So that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.
2508571	2511132	Anybody have to say anything before we turn it back over to All Games?
2512272	2512552	Cake.
2513733	2516234	I have a very important announcement.
2516354	2516574	What?
2518055	2522217	I really, really like cake.
2522537	2522837	Alright.
2524653	2529978	We're going to the fortune cookie message of the day now, as chosen by Drew because he felt it was appropriate tonight.
2529998	2532241	So if you hate this fortune cookie message, what's your email?
2533842	2534563	Classified.
2535224	2536845	Whatever, I'll find it for you and give it to you.
2536885	2538267	Here it is, fortune cookie message of the day.
2553057	2555398	Like a Percival, I'm teaching you.
2555678	2558818	Like a Pokémon, I'm geeking too.
2558858	2563299	Like Mario and Peach, I'm never teaching you.
2563339	2568080	Like Gundam, Siege, you're my destiny.
2568420	2571281	Like Ed, I've lost you from your alchemy.
2571381	2576582	I get a lightning kick from you, just like Chun-Li.
2590920	2608765	You're the only one for me Try so hard to make me see You're the only one for me Priceless like a penis ring You're the only one for me Do it now, pretend you'll be What you'd ever be Now level 17

2725948	2741723	You're the only one for me I've tried so hard to make you see You're the only one for me Priceless like a PS3 You're the only one for me You and I intend only to never be All of the same

2760926	2761767	I actually liked that.
2761807	2762528	That wasn't bad.
2762568	2763148	That was cutely good.
2763228	2765750	I'm going to have to watch it when I'm at an angle that I can see it.
2765810	2767732	This, by the way, was the Leet Street Boys.
2769693	2770293	That was cute.
2770414	2770934	I approve.
2771574	2772035	Good times.
