5880	7880	Secret club tonight
8120	12440	For those of you who don't know what secret club is secret club is where we're going to tell you some secrets
12640	16040	About things that will be happening in the game industry very soon however
16040	21680	There is a rule that goes with secret club and that is that you don't talk about secret club in other words
21680	23680	You're going to hear some things on here
23720	29680	You don't say you heard him here because we've gotten in trouble over stuff before and we just don't care to have the limelight
29680	34740	Anymore, it's really not that important to us so that being said secret club rules one
34740	40280	It's just it's you know really juicy stuff that you got to tell somebody so I know a lot of people were disappointed with
41020	47440	Capcom not porting over resident evil zero over here only Japan's getting it and you know everyone liked resident evil
47840	53600	For we and stuff well they are porting a game over. It's not resident evil though. It's
54520	57780	Another game also happens to have dead things running around
57780	59780	in
59900	61420	January
61420	66740	Dead rising coming through the wii yay, so that would be pretty cool. That could be interesting
67940	75980	Also, they have a pretty strong lineup for the winner so far one that's been delayed bionic commando as actually now set in
76300	77300	February
77300	83180	Hopefully that sticks resident evil 5 in March and Street Fighter 4 in January
83180	89740	Of course the latter ones being all on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360
89860	95860	That's a weird month for Street Fighter 4 January. Yeah, well. There's another I read another story though
96420	102420	From juice France those in the same thing. They said a winner release for it, so it fits so all right
103940	107620	It's a good spot to put it. I mean cuz there's nothing comes out in January. That's it
107620	112700	All right, we're gonna do something very special now, and I'm gonna leave I'm leaving
113220	118140	I'm running to the store because we're gonna do cake and I need to get some plates and some forks and all that good stuff
118140	124260	And I need some other stuff myself so this store happens to be just down the street and around the corner

154540	156900	He's gonna get in a car accident die
156900	162700	That's games timer is running. Maybe we'll be able to do a show next week cuz he'll be dead
162700	165660	I don't want to sit in Rob's chair, but I want to fuck up his computer
169020	171020	Can't hear you the windows closed
171020	183540	Uh-huh, that's Rob's alarm that doesn't do any good. He's running
186700	192020	Don't understand why why does he not have plates that's what I said, that's not what I said like I
192980	194980	offered to wash
195220	197220	the plates
197220	202660	I'm gonna go buy some so that my cosplayer has some pretty awesome cleavage
204140	209700	You've gotta have those did Rob say part B. I don't know
211860	214120	Let's close the computer down yes
216180	218600	Whoa shit my mic was off. I was
218600	227080	I can't be a host rather than Mike. Oh no. Oscar told me to say boob ten times, so I'm gonna say it ready boob ten times on air XD
228080	230240	Har-har-har, this was said
233040	236560	You know I need to add a thread for a thread with auto in
237360	240200	The ole army thing I've been playing a few people
240200	243760	It's been fun, but most of the time I get invited to games and no one knows who I am
243760	250920	So just a reminder for all our army people I believe there is a group for steam
250920	256800	I believe there's also is a clan on X fire might want to join it true because it's getting kind of lonely
257240	259240	Pass the mic over
260160	262160	Pass the mic over
263160	266480	You may like it, but women have precedents because we have boobs
266480	276440	Awesome, you know what I'm gonna. Do I'm gonna go to the bathroom a game. Thanks. We are hijacking the afterbirth officially
278440	281080	Oh my god always does this
281080	284600	Okay, okay, wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on
294920	296920	And this is what happens when women run show
300280	306760	We've come to hijack the afterbirth and talk about comics we hate the scrolls
307880	309880	they suck so bad and
309880	311880	um and they suck
312120	316760	They do suck and they turn green well. They are green, but they turn into other people
318120	323360	And that sucks, and we don't know who's actually a scroll for all we know half the chat room could be scrolled
324800	330120	Andrew could be a scroll, but we wouldn't know the difference even if he did turn green. I love Marvel, but Marvel hates me
330120	340800	The show makes me turn green. Scroll!
340800	347680	Okay, act death protests and toshin protests and a bunch of people said that they're not scroll so that means they are
348680	350680	You just want us to
350680	352680	If you say you aren't a scroll, you are a scroll
352680	354680	Do they weigh less than a duck?
356080	358080	I mean we can find out
358080	361000	And don't eat us cuz you can't become us
361920	363920	Wait different universe. Sorry
366000	369120	And cheeseburger if you have to ask it means you are one
372480	377680	Yes, the Hulk does turn green actually the Hulk turns gray and red and
377680	386720	He in one universe he eats people's brains damn the Patriots and poops them out I
388920	391480	Just thought it was intensely hilarious that they had to save his poo
392000	396000	Because it had alien matter. No no it had alien rubber bands in it
397680	401720	You know not what you just what you're talking about unless you read the comics in my bathroom I
401720	407520	I keep comics in my bathroom everybody just die monster. You don't belong in this world
408240	412520	I do okay the comics in my bathroom right now is that three volumes of the ultimates I?
413520	415660	Have I'm sorry one
416520	421400	And I know it's why exiles cuz it's awesome, and you suck. Why God why?
423200	425360	Can I kill him ultimate volume one and two
425920	429440	You're actually not supposed to like it supposedly if you like Marvel
429440	435360	But it's actually better written than the actual Avengers ha ha ha I said it see how easily provoked Jamie is I?
436080	438320	Actually have nothing against the ultimate series I
439200	441640	Have everything against you though, so it's okay. I
442280	444280	Know I know
444680	452120	So if you're into comics if you were into the Iron Man movie there is a new invincible Iron Man series that came out
452560	456400	Not this last week, but the week before you'll probably be able to find it in
456400	461640	Your local comic book store. It's a good starting point for people who have
462280	466820	Seen the movie and want to learn more about Iron Man, but have never read any of the comics
467720	469720	the main villain so far is
470240	476280	Jebediah stain who is the son of Obadiah stain the main villain from the Iron Man movie you'll see
477440	484600	And you'll see roadie, and it's it's a very good comic a good writer good artist well
484600	491080	Yeah, okay artist. I'm not too happy with art, but overall a good recommendation for a comic
491440	494440	Rob has now been gone for five minutes and 45 seconds
497640	499640	Five minutes have elapsed
503720	507900	Another good comic this week was x-men divided we stand number two
507900	515580	Which is one of the Messiah complex comics dealing with the x-men featuring?
517500	519500	That's what you were reading earlier
519740	525260	I have downloaded it and have yet to read it because I was reading Mighty Avengers and reading this Silent Hill
525900	527900	Series that I'm waiting on to be finished
529420	533180	My Silent Hill comic was very disturbing and it was about a
533180	538780	A contract killer who ran off with his boss's wife to Silent Hill
540900	548060	Happens I want to go to the best place ever you want to run off to Silent Hill. You'll have a killer good time
550580	553020	Herman Herman head goes fast for tonight
555220	557220	No
557220	559220	He has to drag around that great knife
559220	561220	So how was Mighty Avengers
561380	566700	Mighty Avengers is very interesting because it's fantastic wasn't it it was more scroll tastic
566700	570180	But it was more or less Bob is nuts the comic. Yeah
570820	572740	basically
572740	577700	another good comic that is coming to trade paperback soon, I believe is the
579180	581180	Captain Marvel short series
582020	587980	Anybody who is into classic Marvel knows that Captain Marvel died of cancer many many years ago, but they brought him back
587980	593340	And I know that sounds sucky and it actually has to do with this whole secret invasion thing
593340	596740	But the storyline was fairly decent and the art is very good
596740	600920	And it's definitely worth checking out once it comes out in a trade paperback
603180	606660	I've been told to say something. I can't normally say around Rob. Okay, I
608420	612420	Don't say whatever the fuck I want around Rob so maybe um
614420	616420	What's something that really grosses Rob out
616420	618420	kind of ritual sex
621580	623620	There I said it he likes boobies
624980	630460	All men like boobies. It doesn't matter if they're gay. Yeah, I remember one time at Disneyland
633100	635100	What
638740	640740	He only sucks if you pay him
640740	645740	Only if you're female, sorry lalalala lalala lalalala lalalalala
646980	654020	Lali lu they know I suggested that I say vagina I can say that around Rob though. We saw Margaret Cho. Hi
657020	663020	This is a woman who's part of her stand-up comedy was about her period so no that doesn't work I
663020	669900	I like what she said though. She said that if Richard Pryor had a period he would talk about it. How do you guy?
670440	671900	now
671900	675400	Well, you're not housing a hottie. How do you guy why not?
676200	682700	Because I'm sitting down you should put the webcam thingy on that and do some stuff that we can
683280	685280	stop
685280	694240	Oh, yes, I know what Rob doesn't like Rob doesn't like looking at girls butts
696920	703080	He likes that song right yes nine minutes have elapsed
705140	712080	You know what Rob lied to us he lied to me he's never coming back
712080	716020	Probably right and he probably got into a car accident. The cake is a lie
717000	721400	Given that it takes five minutes to get to the aforementioned store
721840	724980	And then you have to go in and get plates, and then you have to pay for plates
725040	729080	You know what we should do we should go to grab the plates out of the cupboard and go ahead and serve out some cake
729960	735080	And go I guess guess what Rob you know that bet he's doing what he's buying a present
737400	740160	He's getting you a Walmart gift card
740160	746720	I should've told him to buy candles, and then you could all sing me happy birthday, and I could I'm doing it right now nine eight
748040	751960	seven six five four three
753000	755000	two one
755200	756420	time
756420	761480	My mommy just texted it at me. What'd your mom have to say happy Memorial Day tomorrow?
762240	765880	I'm saying thanks mommy. Happy my birthday weekend
766760	768000	and
768000	770560	Happy DJ Ranma s birthday weekend
771160	773160	time

780920	794560	Train wreck-a-rama we has Rex Metal Gear
800000	802000	So I told Rob to get candles I
804760	806760	Told Rob to get bent
806760	812760	There is a poem on my LJ from one of my friends, and it is called love
813400	820080	It's the wonderful love of a beautiful maid the love of a staunch true man the love of a baby unafraid have
820640	827360	Existed since time began, but the greatest of loves the quintessence of loves even greater than that of a mother
827360	832120	It's the tender passionate infinite love of one drunken marine for another
832120	838760	That's fantastic Rob is late late late late. Rob is late late late late
840720	842720	25 seconds
846200	851600	You're a butt fire you Rob I could we could have used the dishes
853200	855200	And I would have loaded the dishwasher
855200	863320	But then you would have had to been here to like clean the dishes. I got some pretzels and chips for me and look
863840	866520	Triscuits redesigned their package isn't that something?
871360	873360	So what did I miss?
875280	880280	Rob you missed the hurricane it came in it rocked us like a hurricane and then left
881160	882440	Yes
