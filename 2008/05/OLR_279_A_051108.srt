00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:24,749
[SPEAKER_01]: The New Nintendo Channel is up and running, Burnout Paradise is soon headed to the PC, and the classic first-person shooter is about to get another sequel.

2
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,472 --> 00:00:43,234
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:46,835
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:51,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

7
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:52,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

8
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:53,177
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

9
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:54,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired.

10
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:55,337
[SPEAKER_04]: You're tired?

11
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:56,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Been a long weekend?

12
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:57,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

13
00:00:58,004 --> 00:00:59,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long everything.

14
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:05,251
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a hot weekend too, and I'm worried about next weekend because it's supposed to be like 20 degrees hotter.

15
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:09,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, we're going to die during the show, so I've got to figure out air conditioning plans.

16
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:10,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a solution for you.

17
00:01:10,757 --> 00:01:11,077
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

18
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:14,040
[SPEAKER_06]: That window, does it have a screen?

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,861
[SPEAKER_04]: It does have a screen on it, so you can't do a little thingy, I know.

20
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:18,662
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

21
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:20,162
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kick that screen off there.

22
00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:20,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the screen off.

23
00:01:21,223 --> 00:01:23,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it in the air conditioner, put a block over it.

24
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:24,284
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that hard.

25
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:26,625
[SPEAKER_14]: See those little black things on there?

26
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:26,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

27
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,246
[SPEAKER_14]: That's for pushing the screen off.

28
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:29,166
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

29
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:29,666
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

30
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,087
[SPEAKER_14]: This is now Home Improvement, the podcast.

31
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:34,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and on top of that, it's Studio Improvement.

32
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:38,330
[SPEAKER_04]: The other voice you hear over there, Tech Master Loki, since he's talking out of turn.

33
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,530
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

34
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking in turn.

35
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,679
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's easy and cheap.

36
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,740
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not expensive.

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll figure something out.

38
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,341
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we have a budget!

39
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a week to figure it out.

40
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:52,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means I'll do something about it on Saturday.

41
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:55,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll worry about it tomorrow.

42
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:56,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And how are you doing, Loki?

43
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:58,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing fine.

44
00:01:58,567 --> 00:01:58,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

45
00:01:58,987 --> 00:01:59,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Had a good week?

46
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:01,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, I guess.

47
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:02,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, all things considered.

48
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,110
[SPEAKER_04]: You went out of town today, right?

49
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I went to Oakland and then I came back from Oakland.

50
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,711
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're back alive!

51
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:08,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

52
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:09,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Oakland sucks.

53
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:35,352
[SPEAKER_04]: and I helped by taking pictures of stuff.

54
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:06,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pinball table and I helped.

55
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:21,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been video game shopping in a while I have enough games to hold me over I'm just gonna pretend that it's not dude, you know, playing him

56
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:48,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, what, Robert Downey Jr.?

57
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not a big... I thought you loved the movie.

58
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:50,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

59
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:52,007
[SPEAKER_04]: But you just don't like him.

60
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:54,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

61
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:54,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

62
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,029
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to take you to see it.

63
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:56,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

64
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do it tomorrow.

65
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,431
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going tomorrow.

66
00:03:59,451 --> 00:03:59,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do it tomorrow.

67
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:01,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, because... Oh.

68
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:03,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, somebody's back in town tomorrow.

69
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:04,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to go hang with them.

70
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:05,634
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll go this week.

71
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:06,742
[SPEAKER_04]: We will.

72
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:10,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I still kind of want to see Speed Racer even though everything I've heard about it is terrible.

73
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been hearing a lot of people like it.

74
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see it, Loki?

75
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,006
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

76
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

77
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,728
[SPEAKER_04]: See, now I heard you wouldn't like Speed Racer unless you're a seven-year-old boy.

78
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:17,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate Speed Racer.

79
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I absolutely hate the cartoon and I like the movie.

80
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:25,574
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I like Speed Racer because it's done by Tatsunoko Studios and that's the place that gave us Gatchaman.

81
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Speed Racer X

82
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, not really, but it's cool.

83
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:55,602
[SPEAKER_14]: It's cool in its own right.

84
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:58,143
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as the Mach 5 has all of its crap, I'm happy.

85
00:04:58,263 --> 00:04:59,603
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's the game they need to make.

86
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:03,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see a game like F-Zero, but on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

87
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:08,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there was Fatal Inertia, but that was kind of eh.

88
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:14,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see something that'll just blow my mind with how great the graphics are and all that.

89
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:19,288
[SPEAKER_14]: It was supposed to be blow-my-mind awesome, but it was blow-my-mind average, so...

90
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:27,076
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

91
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:58,731
[SPEAKER_14]: and you can actually um you know rank up i think all the way to level 10 so i have a long ways to go there i like how they do it it's basically just experience or i guess money that you earn throughout the game so you can play you know for quite a while there's a few lag issues i ran into overall it's pretty good um i just absolutely love that game what can i say um

92
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:02,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than Grand Theft Auto, I did get to play a few other games today.

93
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I played God of War Chains of Olympus, and that's pretty cool.

94
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:13,048
[SPEAKER_14]: I played mainly the demo before, so it was nice to actually get to play the full game.

95
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:14,669
[SPEAKER_14]: If you like God of War, you're going to love this game.

96
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:21,714
[SPEAKER_14]: It's absolutely amazing to see that they were able to put a God of War game onto the PSP and not really sacrifice anything, so that was pretty cool.

97
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:27,198
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, of course, more Space Invaders Extreme, and that game is just all sorts of awesome.

98
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:27,498
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

99
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:30,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

100
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:35,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been trying this week to get around playing Speed Racer for the Wii.

101
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:39,309
[SPEAKER_14]: And especially after last night, it was funny because Nellie went and saw the movie with me.

102
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,511
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's like, do they have a game for this?

103
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:43,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like... Wait, wait, wait.

104
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:44,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

105
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:49,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Your wife, who hates games that aren't called Bejeweled or Zuma, wanted to go buy a video game.

106
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,616
[SPEAKER_06]: She likes Excite Truck.

107
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:52,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I forgot she liked Excite Truck too.

108
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:56,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, she said that this would be perfect if they had Excite Truck, but with those tracks.

109
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:58,602
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like, that would be perfect.

110
00:06:58,762 --> 00:07:00,163
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, well, they have a game for it.

111
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:01,863
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if it's like Excite Truck.

112
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:04,684
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure it's not, but you can try it anyways.

113
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:06,004
[SPEAKER_04]: But does she like Mario Kart?

114
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:07,944
[SPEAKER_14]: She hasn't played Mario Kart yet.

115
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:08,664
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think she would.

116
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,845
[SPEAKER_14]: She loves Excite Truck.

117
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:12,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your wife a fan of Monster Trucks or something?

118
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:15,345
[SPEAKER_14]: No, she just likes the gameplay of that.

119
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope to God they announce a sequel because...

120
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:19,437
[SPEAKER_14]: That game needs a sequel.

121
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says Excite Truck should come down in price.

122
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It should.

123
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Has it not come down in price after all this time?

124
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:26,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

125
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:26,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

126
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:28,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Excite Truck Chanel.

127
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:29,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

128
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:32,149
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as I remember, it's not being sold anymore.

129
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so anything else for your gaming week?

130
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

131
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:54,314
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

132
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:12,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a lot of fun.

133
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a lot of fun playing Mario Kart Online with them.

134
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:39,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I won.

135
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I made it even more fun.

136
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,381
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I lost battle mode, though.

137
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:43,942
[SPEAKER_04]: They whooped me in battle, but I won the race mode.

138
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:45,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like battle mode.

139
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:46,824
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not as cool as it used to be.

140
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:53,788
[SPEAKER_04]: The battle mode is not nearly as cool as it used to be, but the game... I'd consider versus mode like the game itself, and that's great.

141
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:54,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the courses.

142
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the new courses.

143
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,451
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all so good.

144
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:03,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I still stand by not really caring for their selection of retro courses that they brought back.

145
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:04,816
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

147
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,141
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really think that there was a few tracks in there that they should have brought in.

148
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe he had taken a vote or something?

149
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:40,762
[SPEAKER_04]: See, now, but here's the thing.

150
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:48,683
[SPEAKER_04]: If Nintendo was smart about their online strategy, they would have downloadable tracks, and they could do more retro stuff.

151
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:51,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and that's the key phrase, if they were smart.

152
00:09:52,044 --> 00:09:58,865
[SPEAKER_14]: But the thing is, they're not, and they're playing it way too damn safe, and there's not going to be downloadable content available for these games.

153
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:00,508
[SPEAKER_14]: for quite a while.

154
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:13,559
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is one game, and that's coming up in the show roll, about download content that... I know that there's a service that they're... Well, they already unveiled it or announced it, but it's not being implemented until the summer.

155
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:19,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the other weird thing is that, you know, they've got another problem on that Wii to figure out, and that's the fact that I ran out of space on my Wii this week.

156
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:24,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, granted, I've downloaded, like, crap loads of virtual console games because I'm a whore for retro games.

157
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:41,631
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know every channel they released and when I finally copied the Mario Kart channel or I wanted to or no no I copied the Mario Kart channel and then when that new channel came out this week that we're going to talk about later I ran out of space I couldn't install it I had to go back and delete so I've already filled up my Wii and WiiWare's not even up yet

158
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:45,088
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a storage problem on top of everything.

159
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:47,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how the hell I'm going to fit download content on that thing.

160
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, the WiiWare games aren't that large.

161
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:51,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, under 48 megs.

162
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:57,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm going to have to copy the virtual console games to my card and copy them over to one of my players.

163
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just such a hassle.

164
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:03,760
[SPEAKER_04]: One little patch is all it would take to use that SD card as a normal memory.

165
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

166
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, and that's Nintendo, though, for you.

167
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:09,203
[SPEAKER_14]: If it works and it's a hassle, that's okay for us.

168
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:10,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like the Friends codes.

169
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:11,865
[SPEAKER_14]: It works, but it's a hassle.

170
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:20,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, the man that precedes us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights when we tape live, he goes live at 5 o'clock Pacific.

171
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:21,117
[SPEAKER_04]: He's calling me out.

172
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:22,598
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I would beat you, Sky.

173
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:23,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

174
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:26,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that challenge, Mr. Blackwolf.

175
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,067
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll set up a challenge this week at some point.

176
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually not that great at Mario Kart.

177
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:31,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play.

178
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:31,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

179
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:32,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll play.

180
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:35,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this can be the Chromehounds event that never was.

181
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm not that great at Mario Kart, but I'll play.

182
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:38,251
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll play.

183
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:38,732
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

184
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:39,912
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Bobby.

185
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:40,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's set up a time.

186
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:44,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially, you know, and that's another thing that I don't really care about this Mario Kart.

187
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:56,488
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that the AI is retarded and the item selection is also retarded, because when you're up in the first place, you get nothing, and when you're in the last place, it's like, Blue Shell, Blue Shell, Blue Shell, Blue Shell.

188
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:57,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

189
00:11:58,089 --> 00:11:59,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Shells need to die to fire.

190
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Other Nintendo games I've been playing this week.

191
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:03,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up a game for $15 at Costco.

192
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:07,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Williams pinball table collection.

193
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:08,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's the actual name of the game.

194
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:09,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

195
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,579
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't miss it.

196
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the pinball collection featuring all the Williams tables.

197
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:16,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only did DarkSakura have a pinball week, I did too.

198
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:18,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played the shit out of pinball.

199
00:12:19,247 --> 00:12:21,448
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome to get to play that again.

200
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:30,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the value, considering I only paid $15 for it, and I imagine it's $19.99 normally because Costco marks everything down, it's not a bad deal at all.

201
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,477
[SPEAKER_04]: with all the tables you get in there.

202
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:33,858
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a lot of retro tables in there.

203
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:44,866
[SPEAKER_04]: When you consider that Pinball FX on Xbox Live is $10, and they're very similar, but in the case of the Wii One, you get to play games you remember and love.

204
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:45,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of cool.

205
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:48,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to tell you, the control scheme is kind of funny.

206
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:50,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny in a good way.

207
00:12:50,610 --> 00:13:00,196
[SPEAKER_04]: What you do, you use the Wii and the Nunchuck, I mean the Wiimote and the Nunchuck, and the trigger on the Wiimote is the right flipper, and then the little trigger on the Nunchuck is the left flipper.

208
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:01,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

209
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:23,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think is interesting.

210
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:30,561
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get 100,000 points on this table, then you get a credit to play the tournament games.

211
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:32,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I thought was kind of cute.

212
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:35,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's good that they have that on the analog.

213
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:42,233
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, Pinbot, like you were saying, has the spiral on it to where it's not the very top one.

214
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:44,536
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the second to last one gives you more points.

215
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, skill shots.

216
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:45,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

217
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:47,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Tons of pinball games have skill shots.

218
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,920
[SPEAKER_04]: The older ones, not so much.

219
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,781
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just kind of about which chute would it go down to.

220
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:52,843
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Pinbot and some of the other later ones.

221
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:54,925
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's got some great tables in it.

222
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: A Whirlwind.

223
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:56,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that one?

224
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:57,106
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was fun.

225
00:13:58,027 --> 00:13:58,868
[SPEAKER_06]: We almost bought a Whirlwind.

226
00:13:59,048 --> 00:13:59,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

227
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:06,094
[SPEAKER_06]: But the good thing about Whirlwind, though, is that you actually want to have the real table for that so that when you go inside after being outside all day and the wind blows on you.

228
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:07,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it actually blows the wind at you.

229
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:08,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, the Wii doesn't do that.

230
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad.

231
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:10,477
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's good times.

232
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:10,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

233
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So what else was all on that collection?

234
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:14,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, gosh.

235
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:16,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Knight, I know, was there.

236
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Taxi, AJ Mix is pointing out in chat.

237
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:20,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they looked it up.

238
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:22,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

239
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:29,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Actdeft is linking me to a page that has more information about the game because I'm too lazy to go grab my copy of the game.

240
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:31,409
[SPEAKER_04]: It has some really old tables in it, too.

241
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:32,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what is the one?

242
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,651
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one with, like, a giant Satan on it.

243
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:36,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very early, early table on it.

244
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,675
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it doesn't have Hyperball, then I'm okay.

245
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:41,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Gorgar.

246
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,339
[SPEAKER_04]: The first ever talking pinball machine.

247
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,521
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one with Satan on it.

248
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:48,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Shuttle is on there too.

249
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:49,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm looking at the list.

250
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:50,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

251
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:53,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see which of these I own.

252
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:53,934
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

253
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:58,551
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, for the value, it's a great value.

254
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:03,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when you consider there's a very comparable game where the tables aren't quite as memorable.

255
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

256
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:08,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Pinball FX, but it's not quite as memorable as some of these tables.

257
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:09,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're classic tables for a reason.

258
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, the Tommy table is not in the game, DJ Dark Knight.

259
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,920
[SPEAKER_06]: The Tommy table is freaking awesome.

260
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,082
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like pinball at all, it's worth the money to get this for the Wii.

261
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:20,582
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

262
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:22,303
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my thoughts on that.

263
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:24,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the big thing about Black Knight, the Magna save.

264
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:48,595
[SPEAKER_04]: mm-hmm mm-hmm they sent us the wrong magnet safe stickers all right so that's gonna do it for my gaming week because otherwise I was just playing World of Warcraft and usual by the way World of Warcraft accomplishment are you ready I got my epic flight form on my druid this week 5,000 gold down the crapper here's your applause ready all right thank you I got one clap

265
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:54,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get to some housekeeping and then we'll get to the gaming news tonight.

266
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:55,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guess what?

267
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:56,279
[SPEAKER_04]: The All Games...

268
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,462
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf says, I thought that was a slap, not a clap

269
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,152
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says some jackass columnist for Time compared WoW to Scrabulist.

270
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:38,105
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

271
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:06,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're doing a brand new game tonight, and I haven't seen... We're doing Bumper Stumpers.

272
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:07,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

273
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,610
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get that res code away.

274
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:14,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was going to have FootyMonster battle Toshin tonight, and I see FootyMonster's in chat, so I know he's good to go.

275
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:17,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see Toshin, so I'm a little worried.

276
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:20,592
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're giving away that damn code tonight, even if it kills me.

277
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:22,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew!

278
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:22,973
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you ewing?

279
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:25,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Funhaus is in that collection, and I hate that game.

280
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Funhaus is cool, shut up.

281
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:27,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Because his stupid head.

282
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:28,323
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

283
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:31,186
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you more details on the game in Part B when we play the game.

284
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:33,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see.

285
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:34,889
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

286
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:38,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, we always have our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio on MySpace.

287
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:41,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Our live journal community is Orange Lounge.

288
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:42,416
[SPEAKER_04]: No radio.

289
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also on Facebook.

290
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Just search for O-L-R-M-E.

291
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:46,359
[SPEAKER_04]: O-L-R-M-Y.

292
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,480
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

293
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming news.

294
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,562
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a lot this week.

295
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:50,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it away, Loki.

296
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:51,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

297
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:54,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, as Rob was mentioning,

298
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:59,949
[SPEAKER_14]: When he tried to install the Nintendo Channel, his Wii said, no, you're out of space.

299
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:05,730
[SPEAKER_14]: But the Nintendo Channel, or as it's known in Japan, everybody's Nintendo Channel.

300
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:07,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck that, it's my Nintendo Channel now.

301
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:10,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Is available on the Wii.

302
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:14,193
[SPEAKER_14]: It will allow you to rate different games.

303
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,654
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Wii...

304
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:25,240
[SPEAKER_14]: WeWare games, Virtual Console, and full Wii games after you've played them for an hour, as well as there's going to be some, I think, video that you can watch of different games.

305
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:33,246
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the coolest thing, though, that you'll probably see available for it is DS demo downloads, which is pretty awesome.

306
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:37,288
[SPEAKER_14]: You can stream those to your DS just like a download station.

307
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:39,710
[SPEAKER_14]: So go check it out.

308
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,713
[SPEAKER_14]: It's absolutely free, and who doesn't like demos?

309
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Free if you sell your soul to Nintendo.

310
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:47,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

311
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:52,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because you have to agree that the thing will, I don't know, monitor.

312
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,084
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is it doing?

313
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:57,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sending anonymous usage data about the games you've been playing.

314
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:01,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know how the Wii's been secretly compiling the amount of time?

315
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to that note in your board, and you can see how long you've been playing the games?

316
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:07,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that information gets sent to Nintendo, and in turn, you get the list of DS games.

317
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,870
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, you don't do it?

318
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,370
[SPEAKER_04]: No games.

319
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:10,551
[SPEAKER_04]: No DS demos for you.

320
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

321
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:14,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm not too worried about it.

322
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:16,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I gladly clicked yes.

323
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:16,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't care.

324
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:30,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, what is Nintendo going to do knowing that some, you know, schmo in Sacramento, California was playing way too much, you know, And they'll know that I like Excite Truck and then they'll go, hey, people like Excite Truck, let's make another one.

325
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:31,763
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's not a bad thing.

326
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:35,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's fairly smart of them to have something like that enacted.

327
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:42,479
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good way to... I think it's a good non-intrusive way, I think, for market research.

328
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:43,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

329
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,725
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't like EA where it's like, hey, we've got your credit card number.

330
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:48,715
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to know what you're buying.

331
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:53,599
[SPEAKER_04]: True, I don't think Nintendo saves your credit card information because you have to input it every freaking time.

332
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Once again, it works, but it's an inconvenience.

333
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:02,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you actually check out the channel?

334
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, did not download it.

335
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:05,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't even plug it in.

336
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:06,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Too busy playing Grand Theft Auto 4.

337
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:11,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I did download it, and it wasn't quite as cool as I had hoped.

338
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:14,417
[SPEAKER_04]: They have some videos on there, which is kind of interesting to see on the Wii.

339
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:17,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that just a recurring theme with the Wii?

340
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,842
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't quite as cool as I had hoped.

341
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:32,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, seriously.

342
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:33,192
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting.

343
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:34,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm glad.

344
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,012
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an interesting thing.

345
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:41,294
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also something they talked about E3 prior to the Wii launching that this was already supposed to have happened at launch.

346
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,315
[SPEAKER_14]: What's taking them so long?

347
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:46,176
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously, what is taking them so long to implement this crap?

348
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:52,498
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, oh, well, eventually we'll get a unified online service and stuff.

349
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:52,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, great.

350
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,158
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad that you're catching up to Microsoft.

351
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:56,879
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll only be a few years now.

352
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:05,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe they just had some fine-tuning to do or something, or maybe they just kind of rushed the Wii out there, and now there's only so many people that work there.

353
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,232
[SPEAKER_14]: People aren't interested in online.

354
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:08,232
[SPEAKER_14]: What are they talking about?

355
00:21:08,752 --> 00:21:10,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Xbox Live statistics are bullshit.

356
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,033
[SPEAKER_14]: They're pulling it out of their ass.

357
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:14,494
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

358
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at chat here.

359
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, I like the channel.

360
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:18,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the demos.

361
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:24,897
[SPEAKER_04]: AJ Mix says, demos is pretty much the high point, and it has the commercial that has the kid that says, I am Mudkip.

362
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:27,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed that.

363
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:28,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go back and look.

364
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:42,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was thinking like, wow, it'd be kind of cool if there was like a YouTube-ish channel where cute little viral things could be on there, but then I'm thinking, oh, but there's the internet channel, so I could just go to YouTube on the internet channel.

365
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:44,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Why bother?

366
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:48,492
[SPEAKER_14]: And then four hours later, you'll be able to watch the latest viral videos.

367
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:51,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

368
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:52,729
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

369
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Other stuff going on in the Wii world.

370
00:21:55,231 --> 00:22:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of fanboys, including myself, have been eagerly anticipating the release someday of Kid Icarus on the Wii.

371
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:07,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the thing is that it may have actually been spoiled this week by IGN.

372
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:13,121
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that guy over at IGN who's, you know, he's like the quintessential Nintendo fanboy.

373
00:22:13,161 --> 00:22:14,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that that's an issue, but he just is.

374
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:16,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt Casamassana?

375
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:17,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how you say his name?

376
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:19,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Casamassana.

377
00:22:19,185 --> 00:22:19,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Casamassana.

378
00:22:20,728 --> 00:22:23,891
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, he probably heard that like a million times in the third grade, Loki.

379
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:24,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

380
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:31,478
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so this guy, he was in the IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast.

381
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:33,260
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, Nintendo has voice chat?

382
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,700
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

383
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,383
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they name all their podcasts after stuff.

384
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:38,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Like they have, was it the...

385
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:45,317
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say Red Ring of Death is their Xbox 360 podcast.

386
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:45,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

387
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:46,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

388
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:50,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So they make fun of the system in their name.

389
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:53,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the PlayStation 3 crayon-eating cast.

390
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:53,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

391
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:54,324
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fine, whatever.

392
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:56,765
[SPEAKER_04]: The IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast.

393
00:22:56,805 --> 00:23:00,908
[SPEAKER_04]: He says in this, of course, Nintendo's going to have some E3 surprises.

394
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:03,130
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Kid Icarus for crying out loud.

395
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,531
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times do we have to say it?

396
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out for crying out loud.

397
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:15,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and you kind of think this guy might kind of know something going on on the inside because usually, you know, these really big gaming sites are kind of in on what's to know.

398
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:20,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It really wouldn't surprise... There's been little breadcrumb clues to that this is going to happen.

399
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,195
[SPEAKER_04]: A, he showed up in Brawl.

400
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:23,676
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be a big clue right there.

401
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:24,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly think that's a clue.

402
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:31,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And we heard that, what was it, Factor 5, I think, was developing an unknown game that was suspected to be this.

403
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:43,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, I guess on the next show, the same guy, he actually said, Kid Icarus, that's another one I'm really anticipating, just because I love the franchise, and I'm sure the developer will make a really pretty game.

404
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:48,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So he said it twice, that it's coming.

405
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe if I keep seeing stuff, it'll come too.

406
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Some things say they're coming and never do, so...

407
00:23:53,243 --> 00:24:01,930
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, I can't wait for, I cannot wait for Compile to reform and have a booth at E3 this year and announce Guardian Legend 2.

408
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:02,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for that.

409
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:04,773
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be the show winner right there.

410
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:07,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Technically, there was a Guardian Legend 2, so we went Guardian Legend 3.

411
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:08,736
[SPEAKER_04]: What was Guardian Legend 2?

412
00:24:09,757 --> 00:24:11,458
[SPEAKER_06]: The Guardian Legend that we got over here in the US.

413
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:12,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

414
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,820
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one was Guardic.

415
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Guardic, or whatever.

416
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:16,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So, just letting you know.

417
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:16,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Just

418
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:22,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Get together and make a new game that is like Zelda plus shooter.

419
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:22,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be awesome.

420
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:23,930
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

421
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see.

422
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:29,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, something that didn't make our little list, but I know I saw it on the internet.

423
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:32,014
[SPEAKER_04]: There was like some concept artwork that supposedly leaked.

424
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I don't know.

425
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:34,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it kind of screamed fanboy to me.

426
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:43,499
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it was actually, it was stuff that they were, it was a company pitching the idea of a Kid Icarus game, and they sent off a bunch of different shots.

427
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:44,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

428
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,043
[SPEAKER_14]: But, like, it was weird, because if you've seen the shots, Pit looks all, like, buff.

429
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:54,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they have a bunch of different styles of shots and stuff, so it's not just that super buff one that you're seeing.

430
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,354
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was from a website, Combo, with a K. Okay.

431
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:04,513
[SPEAKER_14]: and I guess not to be confused with Zombo.

432
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:06,795
[SPEAKER_14]: There was another website that had some stuff.

433
00:25:09,502 --> 00:25:14,306
[SPEAKER_14]: They said that, I guess it was supposedly from Factor 5, where those pieces of artwork came.

434
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:18,389
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have, like I said, a bunch of different shots.

435
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:31,180
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some that look really realistic, there's one that looks like a really shitty cartoon, there's some emo shots, something that looks like it might have been out of Kingdom Hearts, you know, just like a whole bunch of stuff.

436
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,742
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, some of it looks a little bit fanboyish, but...

437
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:40,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's slowly... A fact that a Kid Icarus game would be coming to Wii in the first place is a little fanboyish, don't you think?

438
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:42,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

439
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:42,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

440
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:46,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I will be first in line to pre-order and then thusly buy this game.

441
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I love the original 8-bit that much.

442
00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:53,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know, since they have the characters from Mother in there, maybe Mother 3's coming here.

443
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:54,294
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

444
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:56,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you gotta be a dick?

445
00:25:57,995 --> 00:26:03,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not the one that's saying, hey, let's localize a game for Europe and I'll bring it to the U.S.

446
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:07,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Import time FTW.

447
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:20,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho, for those who have been waiting for WiiWare, we have a bit of a release from Nintendo giving us some ideas of what's definitely going to be out for the launch of WiiWare.

448
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you are ready, has them.

449
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:25,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

450
00:26:25,578 --> 00:26:36,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Defender Castle, 500 Wii Points, Pop for 700 Wii Points, VIP Casino Blackjack for 700, TV Show King for 1,000, whatever.

451
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:37,246
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

452
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:38,206
[SPEAKER_06]: TV Show King.

453
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:39,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a trivia game.

454
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,268
[SPEAKER_04]: For 1,000 points.

455
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:46,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I like Defender Castle, and that's 500 points, and then TV Show King.

456
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,272
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

457
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that going to be like Seen It?

458
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:50,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost Winds for $1,000.

459
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:52,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it pretty good.

460
00:26:52,838 --> 00:26:56,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles My Life as a King for $15.

461
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,821
[SPEAKER_14]: That I'm not too sure if it looked good or not.

462
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:00,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not buying that at a protest.

463
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:01,562
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no Dr. Mario.

464
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:03,343
[SPEAKER_06]: What is wrong with this picture?

465
00:27:03,363 --> 00:27:06,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Dr. Mario was like a late add to the list or something.

466
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:07,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but still.

467
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:08,665
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming.

468
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:11,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to throw pills at Viri.

469
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:13,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can do it on the internet.

470
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:14,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

471
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:16,088
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

472
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:17,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching.

473
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:18,647
[SPEAKER_14]: See you next time.

474
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Talking a little bit about Castlevania for the Wii.

475
00:27:38,062 --> 00:27:54,333
[SPEAKER_14]: A second link, also coming from another Brazilian site, apparently has some quotes from Shinji Hirano, an executive VP for Konami USA, stating that Castlevania titles were headed to the Wii and DS.

476
00:27:54,933 --> 00:28:02,538
[SPEAKER_14]: He says that we'll learn more information about these titles come next week, when Konami is holding a press event in the US.

477
00:28:04,324 --> 00:28:06,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Goddammit, where's my invite for this shit?

478
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously?

479
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:15,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they promised us that when a Castlevania game was going to be coming that you would not actually have to use the Wiimote as a whip, right?

480
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:16,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that would be the most hokey thing ever.

481
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:23,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I doesn't really say anything about that though, but... God.

482
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:27,299
[SPEAKER_14]: If I were to guess, I would say you probably use the Wiimote as a whip.

483
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

484
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

485
00:28:30,283 --> 00:28:33,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, moving on to other Nintendo news.

486
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:33,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Fit.

487
00:28:34,025 --> 00:28:37,446
[SPEAKER_04]: We still don't have this game in the US, but it's come out in Japan.

488
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:38,587
[SPEAKER_04]: It's come out in the UK.

489
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:46,271
[SPEAKER_04]: See, now this is Nintendo playing a little game with us called Here's What the UK Feels Like all the time with this game.

490
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:47,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, darn.

491
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't get Wii Fit.

492
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:49,832
[SPEAKER_14]: So sad.

493
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:53,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well, at least I had Brawl early and Mario Kart.

494
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:54,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure you don't need Wii Fit?

495
00:28:55,195 --> 00:28:55,735
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure.

496
00:28:55,755 --> 00:28:56,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure you should?

497
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:57,876
[SPEAKER_14]: I already bought Wii Fit, okay?

498
00:28:57,996 --> 00:28:58,736
[SPEAKER_14]: So shut up.

499
00:28:58,796 --> 00:28:59,557
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm messing with you.

500
00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:01,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I have Wii Fit.

501
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:02,371
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on order.

502
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:03,273
[SPEAKER_14]: It's paid for.

503
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:04,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wait.

504
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:05,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're here.

505
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:07,988
[SPEAKER_04]: WeFit basically crushed one girl's dreams.

506
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:08,629
[SPEAKER_04]: This is it.

507
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:09,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote,

508
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:31,331
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

509
00:29:55,209 --> 00:30:02,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's just a game, but seriously, we already have to worry about young girls starving themselves to look like magazine models, and now we have a game that tells them they're fat.

510
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:08,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this going to be a problem when this game comes out over here?

511
00:30:08,977 --> 00:30:09,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Question.

512
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:13,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Who actually uses the weight measurement of stone?

513
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,260
[SPEAKER_06]: They do in Europe.

514
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,500
[SPEAKER_14]: That's retarded.

515
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,681
[SPEAKER_06]: She weighs 84 pounds.

516
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:17,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

517
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:18,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

518
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:21,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was so upset about being called fat, she ate the board.

519
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:26,033
[SPEAKER_06]: 49 and being 84 pounds, that's not really...

520
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,160
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it is unfortunate.

521
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,361
[SPEAKER_06]: And for being 10 years old?

522
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:33,223
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to remember, though, it is just a game.

523
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:39,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I kind of compare this to the fact that in brain training, like when you try to say blue, it doesn't pick it up.

524
00:30:39,928 --> 00:30:42,450
[SPEAKER_04]: You go, blue, blue, and it doesn't listen to you.

525
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And you go, brew, and it listens to you.

526
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:45,733
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

527
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:50,256
[SPEAKER_14]: She's going to have to do a lot of starving herself in order to become a model nowadays.

528
00:30:50,536 --> 00:30:53,659
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a competitive market out there, and just refit is telling the truth.

529
00:30:54,099 --> 00:31:04,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they've actually been sort of showing a trend lately now where the super skinny, you know, rail thin model is no longer being considered attractive by a lot of companies.

530
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:05,272
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all right.

531
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:07,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I know when I get Wii Fit, it's not going to say I'm overweight.

532
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,156
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to say, get off!

533
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:10,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Get off me!

534
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Being thin causes cancer.

535
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:14,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you heard?

536
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:16,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Fat is the new thing.

537
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:46,768
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing now is that there are actually studies out there saying that it's better to be, quote, overweight and active than be real thin and inactive.

538
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:50,872
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says, love handles greater than exposed ribs.

539
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:52,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yeah.

540
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:54,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you gotta have something to grab onto, you know.

541
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:03,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to, you know, I wouldn't want to date some guy that I had to, you know, if I grabbed a hold of him, I'd, like, poke a hole through my hand by his hip bone or something.

542
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:04,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Or ow.

543
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:05,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

544
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:11,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that... Sorry, skeletons aren't sexy.

545
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:12,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Skeletons belong in a grave.

546
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:14,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always mispronounce his name in chat.

547
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:15,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

548
00:32:15,606 --> 00:32:18,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Hippolytus says, Brain Training 2 has no blue.

549
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:19,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good.

550
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:22,968
[SPEAKER_04]: That might make the sequel worth it alone, because I'll tell you, that blue thing was very frustrating.

551
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:23,668
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

552
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:25,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

553
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:49,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, fat!

554
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:50,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

555
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:54,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it took the game to tell you that.

556
00:32:54,540 --> 00:33:01,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So listeners and everybody that's going to be buying this game here in America, this is your chance to practice your attitude, okay?

557
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:03,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, you've got to have attitude.

558
00:33:04,245 --> 00:33:09,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the thing, is that when the game tells you that you're fat, you go, I am, and that's more of me to love.

559
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:11,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to yell back at the game.

560
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:15,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the whole point is just, you know...

561
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,855
[SPEAKER_06]: To just get out and do something.

562
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:23,236
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the whole reason why I think that Wii Fit exists.

563
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:29,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so that you're not sitting around playing a game, you're up and doing something, I think.

564
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:41,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it doesn't matter what a game that, first of all, does not see what you look like, does not know who you are, has no concept of what your life is like,

565
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,483
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a sequel called We Fat that's specifically for fat and fabulous people.

566
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,490
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be the sequel.

567
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:11,335
[SPEAKER_06]: The point of the game is just to get up and do something.

568
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:26,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, that's why the Wii has sold gazillions of consoles as it is, and Wii Sports is because Wii has that persona of, oh, it's a video game, but you get up and you do things.

569
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

570
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:27,031
[SPEAKER_04]: You do?

571
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:27,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

572
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:29,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't when I'm playing it.

573
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:55,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I've really actually, I've kind of been enjoying this trend from Nintendo lately where their games aren't just about fun, they're about fun plus improvement.

574
00:34:56,315 --> 00:34:57,999
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like brain training.

575
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:03,121
[SPEAKER_06]: or we've got our Wii games that get us up and moving.

576
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami has had their similar games too.

577
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:16,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's more or less that there's been all this complaining about, oh, video games rot your mind and you sit on the couch and don't do anything and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

578
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:23,899
[SPEAKER_06]: But now they're doing something, exercising your intelligence, working your brain, working your body.

579
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:24,920
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making it fun.

580
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,061
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

581
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,081
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is the whole...

582
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:30,404
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically, they're following the money.

583
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:37,310
[SPEAKER_14]: They're trying to figure out what gimmicky things they can do to get people that don't normally play games to play these things and buy them.

584
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:42,695
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's why they're focusing on the brain training stuff because people think, oh, it'll make me smarter.

585
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:46,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to be smarter because smarter is good.

586
00:35:46,218 --> 00:35:50,842
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, the whole Mario Kart and that stupid wheel attachment.

587
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:52,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's pretty neat.

588
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:53,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me get that game.

589
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:54,686
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like I'm driving a real car.

590
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,507
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that Wii Fit looked kind of fun

591
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:19,584
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to buy it.

592
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:22,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to say.

593
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:26,588
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole reason that I would want to play it is just because it looks fun and I like doing active things.

594
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:32,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit, that's kind of the reason why I'm going to get it, too, is that, yeah, it will kind of get me off the couch.

595
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:34,592
[SPEAKER_04]: How long it will last, though, that's the question.

596
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:37,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want to reenact DDR Night.

597
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:39,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Comments in chat.

598
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:41,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Hippolytus says, Brain Age tells you you're dumb.

599
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:42,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Fit tells you you're fat.

600
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:45,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Gerardimo says, both of them together tell you you're fat and dumb.

601
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:51,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is about demoralization, apparently.

602
00:36:52,832 --> 00:36:55,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Queltipo says, can we have soul training, please?

603
00:36:56,075 --> 00:37:00,558
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have Wii morals or something like that.

604
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Wheel of morality, turn, turn, turn.

605
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Show us the lesson that we should learn.

606
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Today's lesson is...

607
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:09,024
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the game they need on Wii.

608
00:37:09,064 --> 00:37:12,667
[SPEAKER_04]: They need some type of moral lesson game.

609
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And every kid in America should play it.

610
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,491
[SPEAKER_06]: We already get other people's moral shoves down our throat every day.

611
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:18,732
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need our games doing it.

612
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:27,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot to mention, I think this week too, I know it wasn't on that launch list, but I'm pretty positive that it's one of the WiiWare launch titles.

613
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, there's also the Major League Eating game that comes out as well.

614
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:33,825
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know.

615
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:35,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

616
00:37:52,416 --> 00:38:16,689
[SPEAKER_04]: that's great more of a cultural and that's all it needs to be here too I don't think they should shove morals down throat but they should you know have you know common sense type things you know like you know sense training don't call people ugly names good idea bad idea the game good idea bad idea the game good idea or we driver training trick or treating on Halloween bad idea trick or treating on St.

617
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:21,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick's Day yes that type of I don't know how you make a game out of that

618
00:38:22,944 --> 00:38:26,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like when you lose, Chainsaw Man comes and cuts your head off.

619
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:26,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

620
00:38:27,186 --> 00:38:27,546
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

621
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:29,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Resident Evil 4 mixed with Wii morals.

622
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:29,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii ethics.

623
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:30,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, forget it.

624
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:31,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

625
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:33,270
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68 demands pee training.

626
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now this topic has gone down the toilet.

627
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:36,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Next story, please.

628
00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:40,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want the game with the toilet that sings like on those training videos.

629
00:38:41,514 --> 00:38:47,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, going back to... I'm sorry.

630
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:47,838
What?

631
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:56,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Gerardimo, good idea, feeding stray kittens in the park, bad idea, feeding stray kittens in the park to a bear.

632
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:02,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, great concept, great concept.

633
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:03,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I read the next one?

634
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can.

635
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I had to read that.

636
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:11,275
[SPEAKER_06]: We has games for, we has games for virtual console in the UK.

637
00:39:12,236 --> 00:39:13,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to know what they are?

638
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:19,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, in one of these, I so, so wish we would get it over here.

639
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:22,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, stop complaining, and what is it?

640
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,911
[SPEAKER_06]: They get Puyo Puyo 2.

641
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:24,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

642
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:25,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

643
00:39:27,374 --> 00:39:30,476
[SPEAKER_06]: They also get Metal Slug for Neo Geo.

644
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:36,381
[SPEAKER_06]: And... Now, I'm trying to...

645
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, these are actually released on here.

646
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:42,135
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of the ones that's making me go, huh?

647
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:43,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Break-In is on there.

648
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:45,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And Cho Aineke.

649
00:39:46,957 --> 00:39:47,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

650
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:56,081
[SPEAKER_06]: And for anyone who doesn't know what Cho Aineke is, it's the games with the mostly naked muscle men and speedos.

651
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a side-scrolling shooter.

652
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:00,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jamie wants Cho Aineke very much.

653
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:02,644
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the TurboGrafx version on top of that.

654
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:03,324
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

655
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:06,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Cho Aineke is, like, crack-tacular.

656
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:07,866
[SPEAKER_04]: You should petition Nintendo.

657
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:11,294
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we won't get over here because people have corn cobs shoved up their butts.

658
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:12,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Not now.

659
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:15,396
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to play some Wii Ethics.

660
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:17,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And not even the good vibrating kind.

661
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:22,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it'd be a little bit less uptight if it vibrated.

662
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, quick next story.

663
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:30,264
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple... Quiltipo's readying his man beam.

664
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:31,824
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, ready your man beam.

665
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:33,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

666
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:37,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's this company that's Matrix Software.

667
00:40:37,406 --> 00:40:41,307
[SPEAKER_14]: You may not know them by their company name, but you know them from their games.

668
00:40:41,747 --> 00:40:49,609
[SPEAKER_14]: They have done the Final Fantasy 3 remake for the DS and are working on the Final Fantasy 4 remake for the DS.

669
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:53,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, now they're working on their own game as well called Alundra.

670
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Alundra!

671
00:40:57,509 --> 00:40:58,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Alundra.

672
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a pretty fun RPG.

673
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,732
[SPEAKER_14]: The art was done by Toriyama.

674
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:21,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, it says, uh, the latest project, I guess, is another original piece.

675
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:24,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, this time, uh, from, uh, Marvelous.

676
00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:30,766
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's called Avalon, uh, Code is the new game, I guess, because they did the launcher for the PlayStation.

677
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:32,288
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um...

678
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:41,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Avalon Code, it doesn't really say what it is, but of course it's going to be done in a similar style as the Final Fantasy remakes, kind of a 3D type of game.

679
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:44,756
[SPEAKER_14]: They said with the art style similar to Crystal Chronicles.

680
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:49,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a Lendera, they're not doing a new Lendera game, but Avalon Code is a new game.

681
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,820
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks spiffy.

682
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,903
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop Insiders GameStop Insiders GameStop Insiders

683
00:42:23,076 --> 00:42:23,336
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

684
00:42:24,057 --> 00:42:27,180
[SPEAKER_04]: The color is metallic rose is supposed to be coming over here.

685
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,262
[SPEAKER_14]: That is absolutely the first time I've ever heard of that.

686
00:42:30,562 --> 00:42:30,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

687
00:42:31,803 --> 00:42:33,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely the first time.

688
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:36,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure that this has never been mentioned on the show before.

689
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:37,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

690
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:38,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Never.

691
00:42:41,411 --> 00:42:43,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, over in Germany...

692
00:42:44,591 --> 00:42:55,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Some German retailers have also listed some other DS-like colors that are supposed to be coming out in Europe, and that is light blue, red, and green, and they all come with matching stylus colors.

693
00:42:55,956 --> 00:43:03,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, with metallic rose being such a pink girly color, I wouldn't be surprised if they maybe, I don't know, got rid of pink or something.

694
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:04,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

695
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:04,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

696
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:07,483
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, they might be getting rid of pink altogether?

697
00:43:07,703 --> 00:43:08,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, maybe.

698
00:43:08,904 --> 00:43:10,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, you know, I mean, what's the point?

699
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:12,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's not that many girls out there that need a new system.

700
00:43:12,886 --> 00:43:16,129
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, and Metallic Rose, that's just, that'll do just fine.

701
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:16,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

702
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:19,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Will there be a comparable boy color coming out, too, even?

703
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:20,552
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know about that.

704
00:43:20,572 --> 00:43:23,094
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, because you've got black and white and all the other colors.

705
00:43:23,154 --> 00:43:24,055
[SPEAKER_14]: It takes a real man to enjoy pink.

706
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:24,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

707
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:25,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Metallic Rose.

708
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:26,536
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's Metallic Rose now.

709
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Sans, you know, what was it?

710
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:32,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendogs, Paw, Silk Screening.

711
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:33,961
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what color I want?

712
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:36,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I want Death Metal Black.

713
00:43:37,063 --> 00:43:39,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Gerardimo wants Sparkle in our chatroom.

714
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:40,704
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

715
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:41,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Sparkles!

716
00:43:41,345 --> 00:43:42,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I want Death Metal Black.

717
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:43,646
[SPEAKER_04]: They just need, like, Chrome.

718
00:43:44,566 --> 00:43:45,747
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I want, like, Red Black.

719
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:46,847
[SPEAKER_04]: How about See-Through?

720
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:47,668
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Red Black.

721
00:43:48,288 --> 00:43:49,048
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have Red Black.

722
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:54,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, the dark, dark, dark, dark, dark red that looks like you're looking to Obsidian?

723
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:56,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a Red Black DS and set it far away.

724
00:43:57,526 --> 00:44:03,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I could get a dark, a black DS and then use like transparent red paint on it and customize it myself.

725
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:03,671
[SPEAKER_04]: You could.

726
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:05,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to customize my DS.

727
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:09,595
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you go to the Nintendo store, they sell those custom DSs you can get in all those different colors.

728
00:44:09,615 --> 00:44:11,457
[SPEAKER_04]: For like $4 billion.

729
00:44:11,557 --> 00:44:14,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I came so close to buying one because I am a consumer whore.

730
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And how?

731
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's what I'll spend my stimulus check on.

732
00:44:18,882 --> 00:44:21,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll fly to New York and buy one of those DSs.

733
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:22,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to customize my own.

734
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:23,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make my own skins.

735
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:26,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really going to do that, by the way.

736
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:27,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Rob.

737
00:44:27,514 --> 00:44:28,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you would.

738
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:57,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream Pinball for PC and Wii, Iron Man on PC, Perry Rodon on PC, Silent Hill Origins on PS2, Supreme Ruler 2020, which is a game about me.

739
00:45:05,962 --> 00:45:07,605
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

740
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:19,688
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked cool.

741
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:21,710
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked cool.

742
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:25,812
[SPEAKER_14]: In the U.S., there's not a whole lot coming out this week.

743
00:45:26,652 --> 00:45:30,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it would be an exciting week if you liked, I don't know, Chronicle of Narnia, Prince Caspian.

744
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:33,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's a few games coming out for that.

745
00:45:33,736 --> 00:45:35,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that wouldn't have to do with the movie coming out this weekend, right?

746
00:45:35,657 --> 00:45:38,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, maybe, yeah, yeah.

747
00:45:38,098 --> 00:45:40,060
[SPEAKER_14]: 360 DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3.

748
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe the Wii version is coming out next week for some reason.

749
00:45:42,981 --> 00:45:44,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

750
00:45:45,191 --> 00:45:46,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Castel of Shikigami 3, Ikaruga, DECA Sports,

751
00:46:08,003 --> 00:46:11,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Wii Ski, also another $30 game.

752
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:19,448
[SPEAKER_14]: That's supposed to be a pretty fun little skiing game, also supporting the Wii balance boards, so you can lean on that.

753
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:20,089
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of cool.

754
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:28,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Drone Tactics for the DS, kind of a weird mechanical insect tactical game from Atlus.

755
00:46:29,093 --> 00:46:33,975
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we've got Myst for the DS, which, you know, it's just Myst.

756
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:36,256
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's just Myst.

757
00:46:36,716 --> 00:46:37,376
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just missed, yeah.

758
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:43,739
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe that's pretty much it, I think, for this week.

759
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that hilarious theme song the DECA Sports game had?

760
00:46:48,221 --> 00:46:48,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God.

761
00:46:49,282 --> 00:46:50,142
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to get that.

762
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:50,943
[SPEAKER_14]: That's funny.

763
00:46:50,983 --> 00:46:52,863
[SPEAKER_04]: That's in our Justin.TV archive, by the way.

764
00:46:52,903 --> 00:46:56,065
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to Justin.TV and you dip back in the archive, you can find that.

765
00:46:56,085 --> 00:46:59,747
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the best part about that game was the really weird theme song that they had.

766
00:46:59,767 --> 00:47:00,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the game was kind of fun.

767
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:01,968
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like Wii Sports...

768
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:05,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like a Wii Sports 2 in a way.

769
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:06,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost.

770
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:08,557
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a fun little party game.

771
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:10,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have that Nintendo touch.

772
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:13,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't explain it.

773
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:20,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo just doesn't have the really cool cheesy theme songs.

774
00:47:21,107 --> 00:47:24,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move over to Japan and look at what kind of releases are coming out over in Japan.

775
00:47:25,731 --> 00:47:30,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a ton of stuff this week but better than last week where nothing came out.

776
00:47:30,555 --> 00:47:33,897
[SPEAKER_04]: The Darkness makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week.

777
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:36,299
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really the only big release on the Xbox 360.

778
00:47:36,339 --> 00:47:37,380
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3

779
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:43,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot for you this week, although there's a couple things next week, but I'll tell you about those next week.

780
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:49,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Totsugeki Famicom Wars Versus.

781
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:52,073
[SPEAKER_04]: You might know that as Battalion Wars 2.

782
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:55,456
[SPEAKER_04]: That is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

783
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:57,999
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a price reduction, because I thought they had that way before us.

784
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

785
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:05,580
[SPEAKER_04]: No, if you want to import it, it's going to cost you $65, so I don't think that's a price reduction.

786
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought they had that a long time ago.

787
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:08,221
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's weird.

788
00:48:08,241 --> 00:48:11,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan has been getting some releases kind of delayed.

789
00:48:11,464 --> 00:48:13,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're re-releasing them or something.

790
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:13,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

791
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,570
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 2, Aoshiro is coming out.

792
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And that also is getting a limited edition version coming out.

793
00:48:26,438 --> 00:48:27,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what this game looks like.

794
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like some type of RPG.

795
00:48:29,023 --> 00:48:30,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking, I don't know, it has little cut scenes.

796
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:33,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it based on anime?

797
00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:38,859
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no actual game screens I can find, just cutscenes.

798
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,299
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to guess that it's a dating sim.

799
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:41,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's a dating sim.

800
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,400
[SPEAKER_04]: When in doubt, dating sim.

801
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,220
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's some type of adventure game.

802
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,461
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the category it falls into.

803
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

804
00:48:47,241 --> 00:48:47,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

805
00:48:47,701 --> 00:48:52,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming out, Slaughter Up Core 10 Mach Go Go Go 2.

806
00:48:53,403 --> 00:48:58,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's Slaughter, S-L-O-T-T-E-R, not like murder with a pickaxe.

807
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:00,445
[SPEAKER_04]: That is Speed Racer.

808
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:02,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like.

809
00:49:02,997 --> 00:49:04,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it has the guy from Speed Racer on the cover.

810
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the classic Speed Racer.

811
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:09,345
[SPEAKER_04]: So some type of game...

812
00:49:11,537 --> 00:49:13,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocketman, It Came From Uranus

813
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:45,463
[SPEAKER_14]: That's on 360 or Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network this week.

814
00:49:46,424 --> 00:49:48,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So mature we are here at Orange Launch Radio.

815
00:49:50,828 --> 00:49:53,471
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have rockets coming out your anus, you might have a problem.

816
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:55,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Rocketman, it came from your anus.

817
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:05,847
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out on the Nintendo DS, Dungeon of Windaria, Luminous Ark 2, and Mahjong Navi DS.

818
00:50:06,388 --> 00:50:08,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet another Mahjong title because you just can't have enough Mahjong.

819
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if there's anything on the PSP.

820
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:18,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Bleach, Heat the Soul 5 comes out for the Sony PSP.

821
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:20,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

822
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:23,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are your Japanese release dates for this week, May 15th.

823
00:50:25,242 --> 00:50:26,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And good for them.

824
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for them.

825
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:33,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's some very interesting yet fun news for us.

826
00:50:35,076 --> 00:50:37,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Burnout Paradise is going to have a PC release.

827
00:50:39,191 --> 00:50:41,373
[SPEAKER_06]: and Criterion said, okay, here.

828
00:50:42,454 --> 00:50:48,120
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going to be actually rebuilding it so that it works pretty well on PC.

829
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,862
[SPEAKER_06]: They're enhancing multiplayer.

830
00:50:50,622 --> 00:51:03,355
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing community content, online features and resolution is at 1920 by 2400 and is pretty much straight from the original.

831
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:06,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious what community features is going to entail.

832
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:07,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Sex.

833
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I somehow doubt that.

834
00:51:09,661 --> 00:51:10,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Group sex.

835
00:51:13,063 --> 00:51:15,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Did somebody break DarkSakura this week?

836
00:51:16,064 --> 00:51:16,604
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up?

837
00:51:16,684 --> 00:51:17,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

838
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,105
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

839
00:51:18,465 --> 00:51:20,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that should be interesting.

840
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:24,608
[SPEAKER_04]: See, the sick thing is now I'm actually picturing that.

841
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how would that work in Burnout Paradise?

842
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:27,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

843
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:30,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Brings a whole new meaning to take me down to Paradise City.

844
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:31,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

845
00:51:33,379 --> 00:51:34,079
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

846
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:59,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, just remember that all the games for Windows stuff nowadays supports the Xbox 360 controller and, of course, the racing wheels.

847
00:51:59,452 --> 00:52:00,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

848
00:52:00,312 --> 00:52:02,753
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have an Xbox 360 controller, why don't you have a 360?

849
00:52:02,793 --> 00:52:11,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you're like pro PC gaming, but you're like, I'm not that into PC gaming where I need to use a controller.

850
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the audience for that that big?

851
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:16,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Crysis with a 360 controller.

852
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:17,519
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just me.

853
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,260
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

854
00:52:19,379 --> 00:52:21,501
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not that into PC gaming.

855
00:52:22,022 --> 00:52:27,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hooray for PC gamers because Burnout Paradise is a solid game and I'm sure they'll be enjoying that.

856
00:52:28,828 --> 00:52:31,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Another game coming to PCs everywhere.

857
00:52:32,071 --> 00:52:37,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyday Shooter is coming to Steam and that was a pretty awesome game on the PlayStation Network.

858
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:42,461
[SPEAKER_14]: I would know though because I hate having to put my credit card information on the PlayStation Network.

859
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:44,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's available now.

860
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:07,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio giving you definitive gaming news every week.

861
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:09,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, we think it's out there.

862
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,631
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's out there now.

863
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:10,871
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

864
00:53:11,372 --> 00:53:17,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I could log on just... If I didn't think it would disrupt the all-game stream, I would log into Steam right now just to check.

865
00:53:17,436 --> 00:53:19,918
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have to get that audio surf game too on Steam.

866
00:53:19,938 --> 00:53:21,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep hearing good things about that.

867
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:22,520
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I bought on Steam is Portal.

868
00:53:22,861 --> 00:53:23,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that anybody cares.

869
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:28,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Movie news.

870
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:31,044
[SPEAKER_04]: More video games becoming movies.

871
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:35,487
[SPEAKER_04]: One game that has been opted apparently for a movie.

872
00:53:35,987 --> 00:53:46,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess what's going on is that Naughty Dog has made the game Uncharted Drake's Fortune and it's been optioned by Atlas Entertainment.

873
00:53:48,260 --> 00:54:15,497
[SPEAKER_04]: so that means that it is possible that in the next few years Uncharted Drake's Fortune could actually become a movie now when I think about video games that I want to become movies this isn't really one that pops right into my head but okay I think it could work though because it's not that much of a stretch it's just you know action adventure thing so Uncharted the movie may be coming to a theater near you in about two years we'll see we'll see

874
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:20,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's other movies in talk.

875
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it says that it's already in development.

876
00:54:23,016 --> 00:54:31,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Bioshock movie to be put out by Universal with Gore Verbinski as the director, it seems.

877
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:37,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hey, that's kind of cool.

878
00:54:37,563 --> 00:54:38,843
[SPEAKER_06]: He did Pirates of the Caribbean.

879
00:54:40,004 --> 00:54:44,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also looks like they've got John Logan as the screenplay writer.

880
00:54:45,689 --> 00:55:10,708
[SPEAKER_04]: well they've made a lot a lot more with a lot less so you know the thing about Bioshock though is that when I play Bioshock it's kind of like watching a movie you know what I mean like I don't know like we're getting to this point where games are so realistic they don't have to be made into movies because they already kind of feel like movies does that make sense nope sorry not hearing you but uh doesn't mean that they won't make a movie out of it all right fine

881
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:15,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's just, you know, if there's money to be made, then they're going to make the money.

882
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:16,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

883
00:55:16,602 --> 00:55:17,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you.

884
00:55:17,143 --> 00:55:17,623
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

885
00:55:17,643 --> 00:55:21,527
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just, there's other games that I would want to see made into movies first.

886
00:55:21,647 --> 00:55:23,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of the other Final Fantasy games.

887
00:55:23,388 --> 00:55:23,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

888
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:25,731
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe that's just the fanboy.

889
00:55:25,751 --> 00:55:28,093
[SPEAKER_07]: We only had, you know, one good Final Fantasy movie.

890
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:29,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was Advent Children.

891
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:30,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

892
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:31,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

893
00:55:32,277 --> 00:55:32,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well.

894
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Grand Theft Auto 4 Grand Theft Auto 4

895
00:55:47,729 --> 00:55:51,272
[SPEAKER_14]: and 3.6 million of those the first day.

896
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:53,094
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's pretty awesome.

897
00:55:54,114 --> 00:56:00,520
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure, well, they're expecting, I think, to do another, you know, a total of a billion dollars by the end of this year.

898
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is even bigger than a movie.

899
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:03,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

900
00:56:03,802 --> 00:56:06,324
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the only movie that made that much money in the U.S.

901
00:56:06,344 --> 00:56:08,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an international figure or just a U.S.

902
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:08,326
[SPEAKER_04]: figure?

903
00:56:08,346 --> 00:56:09,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's international.

904
00:56:09,507 --> 00:56:09,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

905
00:56:09,807 --> 00:56:16,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, still, I mean, Titanic is like one of a few, only very, very few movies has made a billion internationally.

906
00:56:16,633 --> 00:56:17,033
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

907
00:56:17,413 --> 00:56:28,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of that is in, I want to say in the US, because the UK, I read, only sold like about 900, just under a million units.

908
00:56:29,284 --> 00:56:29,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Only?

909
00:56:30,224 --> 00:56:31,425
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of games that would love to sell that.

910
00:56:31,445 --> 00:56:34,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, just under a million when, you know, about...

911
00:56:35,611 --> 00:56:38,973
[SPEAKER_14]: 5 million is coming from the US, I'd say that's the majority of the sales there.

912
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:39,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, fine.

913
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,355
[SPEAKER_14]: But still, yeah, it's going to do very well.

914
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:46,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's been, what, parodied on a bunch of different things now.

915
00:56:47,056 --> 00:56:51,938
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on Saturday Night Live and Conan, so... Although it was kind of lame on Saturday Night Live.

916
00:56:51,978 --> 00:56:53,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it was a little stupid.

917
00:56:53,319 --> 00:56:55,280
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, it's definitely hitting the mainstream.

918
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:55,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

919
00:56:56,958 --> 00:57:01,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta back up in stories and talk about the Bioshock movie because there's some comments from chat.

920
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:06,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Actdeft wants to know, will the main character save the Little Sisters or not?

921
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:10,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Quiltipo wants to know, will Johnny Depp star as a spinny splicer?

922
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:17,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, just because the fan base is massive, that does not mean the fans will buy it.

923
00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:20,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly talking about buying into a Bioshock movie.

924
00:57:20,451 --> 00:57:20,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd see it.

925
00:57:22,116 --> 00:57:24,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd actually see it, too, just kind of out of curiosity.

926
00:57:24,657 --> 00:57:33,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be kind of curious how they'd approach that, too, though, because, you know, there's the whole little sister thing, and you can do very good things or very bad things, depending on your moral compass.

927
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I need Wii Ethics to help me make the decision here.

928
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:37,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, hold on a second.

929
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:42,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it says I should kill you.

930
00:57:42,945 --> 00:57:44,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Wii Ethics says I should kill you, sorry.

931
00:57:44,645 --> 00:57:47,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's not your day, Magic 8-Ball.

932
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:48,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

933
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:51,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Wheel of Morality, Turn, Turn, Turn.

934
00:57:51,483 --> 00:57:53,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Show me which person I should burn.

935
00:57:54,145 --> 00:57:55,506
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best ever.

936
00:57:56,026 --> 00:57:57,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Outcome not favorable.

937
00:57:58,288 --> 00:57:59,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

938
00:57:59,329 --> 00:57:59,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

939
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:00,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire.

940
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:01,430
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

941
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:05,693
[SPEAKER_04]: APB is a game that is coming out from Realtime Worlds.

942
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:10,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And Realtime Worlds, they just bought the distribution rights to the game.

943
00:58:10,256 --> 00:58:11,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big MMO coming out.

944
00:58:12,037 --> 00:58:14,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, they're making no shame about this.

945
00:58:14,779 --> 00:58:19,342
[SPEAKER_04]: They are saying they want to try and get this to Rockstar as Grand Theft Auto Online.

946
00:58:19,782 --> 00:58:27,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, originally, Realtime Worlds, they actually developed the game and they had sold the rights to... I don't remember who the hell they sold it to.

947
00:58:27,731 --> 00:58:28,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they sold it to somebody.

948
00:58:28,732 --> 00:58:29,233
[SPEAKER_14]: But they bought it back.

949
00:58:29,253 --> 00:58:29,833
[SPEAKER_14]: And they bought it back.

950
00:58:29,894 --> 00:58:35,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, you know, APB... Well, Realtime Worlds did Crackdown, you know, awesome sandbox game.

951
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,162
[SPEAKER_14]: And this one's kind of like...

952
00:58:38,794 --> 00:58:49,784
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a sandbox online game, basically, where you have half the people are cops, half of them are crooks, and all sorts of chaos is going on.

953
00:58:50,024 --> 00:58:52,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like a cross between... Cops and robbers.

954
00:58:52,086 --> 00:58:55,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Saints Row, Grand Theft Auto, online, so it's not bad.

955
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,311
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, it'd be pretty easy.

956
00:58:57,351 --> 00:58:59,453
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as there are guns and rocket launchers, I'm sold.

957
00:59:00,218 --> 00:59:00,819
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks pretty awesome.

958
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:03,100
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the one they had during the tech demo.

959
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,303
[SPEAKER_14]: It was during Game Developers Conference.

960
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,664
[SPEAKER_14]: They had the custom characters, and one of them was Shiggy.

961
00:59:12,106 --> 00:59:12,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes.

962
00:59:12,626 --> 00:59:16,009
[SPEAKER_14]: It was with the mushroom boxers.

963
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:16,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

964
00:59:17,029 --> 00:59:18,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Very awesome character creator.

965
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we should say, though, right now, this is in rumor status.

966
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:22,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not confirmed.

967
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:24,334
[SPEAKER_14]: If it comes out as APP, I'll still play it.

968
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:24,914
[SPEAKER_14]: It's awesome.

969
00:59:25,835 --> 00:59:26,115
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

970
00:59:26,956 --> 00:59:27,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Fanboy much?

971
00:59:27,556 --> 00:59:27,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

972
00:59:28,237 --> 00:59:28,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

973
00:59:30,314 --> 00:59:31,875
[SPEAKER_14]: I like my sandbox games.

974
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:32,415
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I say?

975
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:35,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they like you too.

976
00:59:37,298 --> 00:59:37,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

977
00:59:38,379 --> 00:59:40,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on with our next story.

978
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's the best part about Mortal Kombat, Rob?

979
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:45,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Katana.

980
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:50,105
[SPEAKER_06]: What does everybody else think the best thing about Mortal Kombat is, Rob?

981
00:59:50,746 --> 00:59:51,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Friendships.

982
00:59:52,187 --> 00:59:52,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Fatalities!

983
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:54,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, fatalities.

984
00:59:55,343 --> 01:00:06,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, as we know, Midway said that Mortal Kombat vs. DC was going to be a T-rated fighting game with, you know, no fatalities.

985
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:16,816
[SPEAKER_06]: But what it is, is they're not going to be as outrageous as they were, but they are modifying the fatalities.

986
01:00:16,856 --> 01:00:18,877
[SPEAKER_06]: They are going to still be finishing moves in there.

987
01:00:19,988 --> 01:00:24,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the last time they modified Fatalities for the Super Nintendo release?

988
01:00:24,592 --> 01:00:25,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweat, yo.

989
01:00:25,272 --> 01:00:25,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

990
01:00:26,573 --> 01:00:27,334
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I gotta say.

991
01:00:28,675 --> 01:00:36,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, though, I'm going to reserve judgment, but I only want that game to play as Batman, so whatever.

992
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:37,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.

993
01:00:38,442 --> 01:00:46,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's all about that one quote where he says, I'm the goddamn Batman in the comics.

994
01:00:46,471 --> 01:00:49,613
[SPEAKER_04]: It is sacrilegious, though, to perform a fatality on Batman.

995
01:00:49,633 --> 01:00:50,594
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I still don't get.

996
01:00:50,954 --> 01:00:52,095
[SPEAKER_07]: He can perform fatalities.

997
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:55,437
[SPEAKER_04]: He can perform fatalities all he wants, although Batman, I don't think, really kills people.

998
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:56,598
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he does now.

999
01:00:56,678 --> 01:00:57,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.

1000
01:00:57,579 --> 01:01:01,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in the movies, usually when people die, it's their own fault.

1001
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:02,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Batman didn't try to kill them.

1002
01:01:02,823 --> 01:01:03,623
[SPEAKER_04]: They just died.

1003
01:01:03,643 --> 01:01:04,564
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1004
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:07,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Depends on who's actually Batman at any given time in the comics.

1005
01:01:07,766 --> 01:01:14,091
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, the Batman god in my world is Adam West from the 60s Batman, and he never killed no one.

1006
01:01:14,692 --> 01:01:16,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, Batman shouldn't be doing fatalities.

1007
01:01:16,493 --> 01:01:18,535
[SPEAKER_14]: That didn't kill him, it was gravity that killed him.

1008
01:01:18,935 --> 01:01:21,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Gravity and a sudden stopping.

1009
01:01:21,297 --> 01:01:25,780
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an accident, he fell down an elevator shaft onto some bullets.

1010
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:27,262
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1011
01:01:28,883 --> 01:01:29,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1012
01:01:30,084 --> 01:01:30,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1013
01:01:31,832 --> 01:01:39,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, games like Mortal Kombat have been claimed before to turn children into bloodthirsty killers.

1014
01:01:40,316 --> 01:01:42,597
[SPEAKER_14]: But Harvard says otherwise.

1015
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:46,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, you know, Harvard, everybody there is super smart, right?

1016
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:47,659
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've got to listen to what they say.

1017
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:48,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Or rich.

1018
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:49,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Or rich.

1019
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, well, that's even more reason to listen to them.

1020
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:57,223
[SPEAKER_14]: A pair of Harvard researchers say violent video games don't turn children into killers.

1021
01:01:57,943 --> 01:01:58,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Their parents do.

1022
01:01:59,224 --> 01:02:11,832
[SPEAKER_14]: According to a newly published book, Grand Theft Childhood, The Surprising Truth, about video games and what parents do, psychologists Lawrence Kuttner and Cheryl Olson dispel, of course, common myths about video games.

1023
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:22,138
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently they found during their two-year study that there was no data to support any connection between games and real-life violence.

1024
01:02:22,198 --> 01:02:23,879
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not the first time I've heard of this book.

1025
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds pretty good.

1026
01:02:26,106 --> 01:02:35,273
[SPEAKER_14]: They studied 1,200 middle school children in a $1.5 million federally funded study.

1027
01:02:35,353 --> 01:02:45,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead of studying children in the laboratory like other studies, they actually sat down and talked to kids after long bouts of game playing, sometimes in excess of 15 hours a week.

1028
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:51,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Lucky kids, I guess, were playing a variety of games from non-violent The Sims games.

1029
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:52,497
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1030
01:02:52,577 --> 01:02:53,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Depends how you play The Sims.

1031
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,686
[SPEAKER_14]: My Sims sessions are pretty violent.

1032
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it...

1033
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:29,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Grand Theft Auto and they discovered children who played violent video games those rated mature or above were just relieving stress some children did exhibit playful fighting after playing games but this was similar to what children have done always after watching action or karate type movies 51% of the male children who played for 15 hours or more violent video games per week were involved in fights

1034
01:03:31,067 --> 01:03:39,952
[SPEAKER_14]: in the past year compared to 28% who played regular video games.

1035
01:03:40,732 --> 01:03:41,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Doesn't make much sense.

1036
01:03:41,913 --> 01:03:44,274
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess who did not play video games.

1037
01:03:44,815 --> 01:03:45,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways.

1038
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:46,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Articles.

1039
01:03:47,796 --> 01:03:48,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Got the wrong text there.

1040
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:57,222
[SPEAKER_14]: For girls, 40% of the violent game players were in fights compared to, I guess, 14% of the non-violent players.

1041
01:03:58,743 --> 01:04:10,274
[SPEAKER_14]: So despite these figures, I guess Kuttner and Olsen say that this is just a correlation and that fighting was probably due to an underlying psychological problem that children had before playing video games.

1042
01:04:11,695 --> 01:04:22,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I like how they just kind of just, they're all, you know, even though the data suggests that, you know, they may be prone to more violence, it's just, we'll just ignore that.

1043
01:04:22,987 --> 01:04:23,830
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1044
01:04:28,815 --> 01:04:29,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's already out.

1045
01:04:30,155 --> 01:04:30,455
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know.

1046
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:33,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it just came out, or it was about to come out.

1047
01:04:33,696 --> 01:04:38,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I checked it out on Amazon.com about a month ago, and it was coming out at the end of the month.

1048
01:04:39,497 --> 01:04:40,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious about it.

1049
01:04:40,637 --> 01:04:42,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available now.

1050
01:04:43,158 --> 01:04:43,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you have it.

1051
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:45,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it being widely distributed?

1052
01:04:45,978 --> 01:04:47,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think I can walk into any Barnes & Noble and get it?

1053
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:48,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

1054
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:51,439
[SPEAKER_14]: It says right now on Amazon.com you can get it for $16.50.

1055
01:04:51,479 --> 01:04:51,739
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1056
01:04:56,876 --> 01:04:58,718
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to have a live cage match

1057
01:05:24,362 --> 01:05:24,822
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cage Match

1058
01:05:49,175 --> 01:05:57,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, the cage match is involving the Grand Theft Auto IV contest entries that Orange Lounge Radio received this week.

1059
01:05:58,382 --> 01:06:10,012
[SPEAKER_04]: We have whittled it down to four finalists tonight, and tonight, live on the show, our chatters will be picking their favorite in the Orange Lounge Radio Grand Theft Auto IV contest entries.

1060
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:11,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1061
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:28,587
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be great.

1062
01:06:28,807 --> 01:06:31,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So the way the cage match works, if you want to vote, you have to be in our chat room.

1063
01:06:31,728 --> 01:06:37,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com And then you can place your vote via private message only.

1064
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:38,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll explain more about that.

1065
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:43,332
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot vote until all four songs have been played.

1066
01:06:43,392 --> 01:06:50,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are in chat tonight, and you are the author of one of these songs, we'll go ahead and let you vote for your own song because you're actually listening live tonight.

1067
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:52,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get a bonus point, I guess.

1068
01:06:52,314 --> 01:06:53,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you ready to get to the four finalists?

1069
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:58,027
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1070
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:24,711
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to make, or I mean, in Grand Theft Auto 4, they have the radio station that plays when you're driving around town.

1071
01:07:25,051 --> 01:07:35,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, our entrance had to make a bumper that could possibly be heard on the radio in Grand Theft Auto 4, but it had to incorporate Orange Lounge Radio somehow.

1072
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:40,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Like either one of our in-jokes, or one of our, it just had to have something to do with Orange Lounge Radio.

1073
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so here it is.

1074
01:07:43,817 --> 01:07:45,277
[SPEAKER_04]: The four you can vote for tonight.

1075
01:07:45,317 --> 01:07:46,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's finalist number one.

1076
01:07:46,678 --> 01:07:49,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Finalist number one is Actdeft.

1077
01:07:49,558 --> 01:07:51,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And his submission is a little loud, but here it is.

1078
01:07:51,999 --> 01:07:54,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Actdeft's entry into the Grand Theft Auto IV contest.

1079
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:55,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

1080
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you tired and stressed of all your day's work?

1081
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Pull back your anger and listen to O.L.R.

1082
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:06,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Where you listen to hits like...

1083
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,522
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't like you, can't you see Now get the fuck away from me

1084
01:08:51,420 --> 01:09:06,073
[SPEAKER_12]: So reject your false American idols and listen to Armour Shrouds Radio, Sunday nights, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, only on AllDreams.com Show is like pissing in an ocean of piss.

1085
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:14,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was entry number one coming to us from Actdeft.

1086
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and give our thoughts on that.

1087
01:09:16,442 --> 01:09:17,023
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1088
01:09:19,176 --> 01:09:23,037
[SPEAKER_06]: A little derivative, I think, so it gets a seven.

1089
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:23,837
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1090
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:35,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I would have given that a very high score, but look, you made way too much fun of me, and those are clips that are like five years old, and I am so pissed off that they've resurfaced.

1091
01:09:35,701 --> 01:09:37,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really, but whatever.

1092
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:40,282
[SPEAKER_04]: They were taken out of context.

1093
01:09:41,562 --> 01:09:42,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll also give it a seven.

1094
01:09:42,963 --> 01:09:43,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1095
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:45,247
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1096
01:10:07,064 --> 01:10:08,265
[SPEAKER_07]: She's not on crack.

1097
01:10:09,086 --> 01:10:09,886
[SPEAKER_04]: She's totally on crack.

1098
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:28,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, I'm Smith Weston, and I'm here to talk about a growing threat to America.

1099
01:10:28,689 --> 01:10:31,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Iraqi suicide babies.

1100
01:10:31,851 --> 01:10:38,155
[SPEAKER_11]: They may look small and cute, but don't let a situation like this happen to America.

1101
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:44,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my, what a cute baby.

1102
01:10:44,298 --> 01:10:45,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a second, baby.

1103
01:10:45,939 --> 01:10:47,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you have C4 chopped to your waist?

1104
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:49,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Nooooo!

1105
01:10:56,952 --> 01:11:00,314
[SPEAKER_11]: My opponent won't protect you from Iraqi suicide babies.

1106
01:11:00,794 --> 01:11:04,095
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, he refuses to believe they exist.

1107
01:11:04,816 --> 01:11:06,816
[SPEAKER_11]: So vote Smith-Weston for mayor.

1108
01:11:07,157 --> 01:11:08,037
[SPEAKER_11]: The right choice.

1109
01:11:08,957 --> 01:11:10,098
[SPEAKER_11]: For America.

1110
01:11:16,601 --> 01:11:18,662
[SPEAKER_04]: God, the audio levels on these are all so different.

1111
01:11:18,702 --> 01:11:19,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

1112
01:11:19,582 --> 01:11:20,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was entry number two.

1113
01:11:21,103 --> 01:11:24,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Ian M. with the Iraqi suicide babies ad.

1114
01:11:24,304 --> 01:11:24,945
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you guys think?

1115
01:11:24,965 --> 01:11:25,465
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1116
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:29,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have been funny if he hadn't been spitting into the microphone.

1117
01:11:31,175 --> 01:11:39,082
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea was funny, but the execution of said idea... But they're not professionals.

1118
01:11:39,122 --> 01:11:40,403
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to go a little easy on them.

1119
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:49,631
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's why you go back and listen to it, and when you realize you're going, you're speaking into the microphone, then you go back and move the microphone away from your mouth.

1120
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:51,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So it gets a 7.

1121
01:11:52,443 --> 01:11:52,723
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1122
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:59,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was a little popping piece for me that, you know, and this is a problem we even have on the show sometimes because we don't have sufficient mic guards.

1123
01:12:00,305 --> 01:12:02,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really depends on the mic you use.

1124
01:12:02,206 --> 01:12:04,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm being a little more lenient because you might just have a junky mic.

1125
01:12:05,206 --> 01:12:06,567
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea was good, though.

1126
01:12:06,807 --> 01:12:10,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually would have added like some music or something to make it a little more upbeat.

1127
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,008
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe you didn't know how.

1128
01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:13,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't punish you for that.

1129
01:12:13,389 --> 01:12:16,489
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think I think it's going to be tough against these other finalists.

1130
01:12:16,509 --> 01:12:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll also give you a seven, Loki.

1131
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:36,063
[SPEAKER_14]: uh could have been better if you had a lot more like internet clips of like babies cooing or like and like explosions more explosions more baby sounds and i think that would have been like pretty awesome but i'll give you like a seven because it was you know definitely more original and plain clips

1132
01:12:36,463 --> 01:12:39,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here comes finalist number three tonight.

1133
01:12:39,807 --> 01:12:43,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Finalist number three in the Grand Theft Auto 4 contest is Able2Think.

1134
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:44,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's his entry.

1135
01:12:45,012 --> 01:12:46,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a short one, 30 seconds.

1136
01:12:46,314 --> 01:12:49,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Able2Think, next finalist in the Grand Theft Auto 4 contest.

1137
01:12:50,914 --> 01:12:54,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey ya, y'all are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1138
01:12:54,875 --> 01:13:02,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got four strippers giving me lap dance right now and that doesn't even come close to the sublime audio quality of the OLR crew.

1139
01:13:03,638 --> 01:13:08,879
[SPEAKER_09]: If y'all are listening live, it's like a three hour orgasm for your ears, you know what I'm saying?

1140
01:13:09,599 --> 01:13:11,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, OLR is the shit.

1141
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:16,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, y'all keep listening while these girls come back to my place for a little action.

1142
01:13:17,121 --> 01:13:18,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on girls, let's go.

1143
01:13:24,793 --> 01:13:30,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was entry number three in the Grand Theft Auto IV contest tonight.

1144
01:13:31,123 --> 01:13:33,587
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Able to Think, DarkSakura.

1145
01:13:34,281 --> 01:13:41,164
[SPEAKER_07]: That made me snicker, but it didn't have enough going on, so it gets a 6.

1146
01:13:42,444 --> 01:13:47,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was actually a Grand Theft Auto 4 reference in that one, which is pretty good.

1147
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:49,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very pimp, like Grand Theft Auto is.

1148
01:13:50,888 --> 01:13:53,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So I give that a 7 as well.

1149
01:13:53,309 --> 01:13:55,049
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, same thing I told the last guy.

1150
01:13:55,089 --> 01:13:58,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Could I use some music to make it a little more upbeat?

1151
01:13:59,474 --> 01:14:02,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, same as the last one.

1152
01:14:02,457 --> 01:14:04,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I'm going to give this one a six.

1153
01:14:05,139 --> 01:14:05,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the voice.

1154
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:13,386
[SPEAKER_14]: The voice was funny, but it was just needed a little bit more.

1155
01:14:13,486 --> 01:14:24,937
[SPEAKER_14]: We're playing for a freaking limited edition 360 here, which should be going to me, I would have you know, because I am the greatest Grand Theft Auto fan out there, but whatever.

1156
01:14:25,657 --> 01:14:25,997
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1157
01:14:26,792 --> 01:14:28,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, the last entry tonight.

1158
01:14:28,754 --> 01:14:31,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Entry number four in tonight's contest.

1159
01:14:32,057 --> 01:14:36,781
[SPEAKER_04]: The finalist is, drumroll, SSJ100Matt.

1160
01:14:36,841 --> 01:14:40,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is his entry into the Grand Theft Auto IV contest.

1161
01:14:40,304 --> 01:14:41,465
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt, take it away.

1162
01:14:42,425 --> 01:14:53,035
[SPEAKER_08]: From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs Furries, and Orange Lounge Revolution comes... Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix!

1163
01:14:53,922 --> 01:15:04,691
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, the highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMedia is back with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-pissing, ocean-pissing new songs danced in.

1164
01:15:05,031 --> 01:15:13,218
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio hosts like Rob Roberts.

1165
01:15:14,098 --> 01:15:17,901
[SPEAKER_15]: When you call my name, it's like a little home prayer.

1166
01:15:18,161 --> 01:15:19,963
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm down on my knees.

1167
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:21,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm staying in.

1168
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:27,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I want the world to know I'm happy with the pussy.

1169
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:28,181
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura?

1170
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:39,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Please note, there are no real songs sung by DarkSakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lunge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a boat fire on an ocean of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano.

1171
01:15:39,464 --> 01:15:39,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1172
01:15:39,824 --> 01:15:43,025
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan.

1173
01:15:43,365 --> 01:15:46,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get strung out by the way I look.

1174
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:50,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't judge a book by its cover.

1175
01:15:50,414 --> 01:15:51,756
[SPEAKER_04]: John DMN Bresler.

1176
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:53,178
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever go to Duck Island?

1177
01:15:54,259 --> 01:15:55,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Your mom goes to Duck Island.

1178
01:15:57,083 --> 01:16:02,750
[SPEAKER_08]: And a ton of licensed music inspired by the show that the RIAA and North Steel UT don't want you to hear.

1179
01:16:03,069 --> 01:16:08,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer, and you might as well just offer torrents on the website.

1180
01:16:08,431 --> 01:16:11,752
[SPEAKER_08]: So come, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution's second mix.

1181
01:16:11,852 --> 01:16:16,594
[SPEAKER_08]: When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplay.com.

1182
01:16:16,714 --> 01:16:23,097
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck.

1183
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:25,900
[SPEAKER_06]: But I poop from there.

1184
01:16:26,561 --> 01:16:28,404
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's only from the Nintendo Wii.

1185
01:16:28,724 --> 01:16:36,474
[SPEAKER_08]: So come on down to your local participating Liberty City game store, split a WorldCorp breach, bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

1186
01:16:36,755 --> 01:16:38,777
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do, Loki might dress up as Tim.

1187
01:16:38,977 --> 01:16:40,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a guarantee.

1188
01:16:43,752 --> 01:16:49,296
[SPEAKER_04]: There is entry number four in the contest tonight, SSJ100Matt with OLR Revolution second mix.

1189
01:16:49,696 --> 01:16:50,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie.

1190
01:16:50,116 --> 01:16:50,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking ten.

1191
01:16:51,037 --> 01:16:51,857
[SPEAKER_06]: That was brilliant.

1192
01:16:52,558 --> 01:16:54,439
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we were talking about.

1193
01:16:54,779 --> 01:17:04,185
[SPEAKER_06]: We had clever music, clever ideas, good clips too, not just, you know, the same old ones that we hear all the time.

1194
01:17:04,646 --> 01:17:07,588
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't even you singing Sky's Voice the game.

1195
01:17:08,608 --> 01:17:09,629
[SPEAKER_06]: You were doing something else.

1196
01:17:09,969 --> 01:17:11,049
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1197
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:33,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1198
01:17:50,563 --> 01:17:54,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where in the hell you found that clip of me singing like a prayer.

1199
01:17:54,926 --> 01:17:57,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I recorded that in a karaoke room at Great America.

1200
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:58,228
[SPEAKER_07]: You played it on a show before.

1201
01:17:58,588 --> 01:17:59,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this show.

1202
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,951
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was on Travis' show years ago.

1203
01:18:03,332 --> 01:18:10,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where the F you unearthed that clip, but I'm taking points off for you doing that and subjecting all of our listeners to that.

1204
01:18:11,337 --> 01:18:11,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So I give you a 9.

1205
01:18:12,618 --> 01:18:19,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, I would have given you a 9 or 10, but I'm afraid that you are, I don't know,

1206
01:18:21,103 --> 01:18:33,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Confusing the listeners, because I'm afraid that Orange Lounge Revolution 2 does not count towards the I Have Judgment numbers, and that would be a flat-out lie.

1207
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:35,947
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can guess that.

1208
01:18:36,607 --> 01:18:36,967
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1209
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:41,448
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's recap the four that you can vote for tonight.

1210
01:18:41,568 --> 01:18:43,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Entry number one was Actdeft.

1211
01:18:43,949 --> 01:18:44,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft.

1212
01:18:49,632 --> 01:18:51,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, and it was Clips and me singing.

1213
01:18:52,313 --> 01:18:55,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Entry number two was Ian M with his OLR ad.

1214
01:18:56,215 --> 01:18:59,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Entry number three, I'm so used to when it's actually full of songs.

1215
01:18:59,857 --> 01:19:03,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Entry number three is Able to Think.

1216
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:11,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And entry number four you can vote for tonight is SSJ100 Matt.

1217
01:19:12,324 --> 01:19:12,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm down on my knees.

1218
01:19:12,865 --> 01:19:13,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm staying in.

1219
01:19:27,523 --> 01:19:28,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll use a clip of Loki that time.

1220
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:29,224
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1221
01:19:29,544 --> 01:19:32,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, those are just random clips and four entries.

1222
01:19:32,346 --> 01:19:34,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, place vote now.

1223
01:19:34,547 --> 01:19:38,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in chat with your vote.

1224
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:40,890
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're listening on the podcast, so sorry.

1225
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:43,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not able to participate in the voting process.

1226
01:19:43,692 --> 01:19:45,893
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come up with something for you guys later.

1227
01:19:46,453 --> 01:19:47,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Place vote now.

1228
01:19:47,394 --> 01:19:48,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Send your private message in.

1229
01:19:48,434 --> 01:19:50,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We will announce the winner at the top of part B.

1230
01:19:51,576 --> 01:19:58,539
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, we have one more thing we gotta get to before we can end Part A tonight, and that is getting to our classic game of the week.

1231
01:19:58,559 --> 01:20:04,522
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta pay respect to our elders a little bit, because without our elders in gaming, there would be no Grand Theft Auto 4.

1232
01:20:05,102 --> 01:20:09,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, take it away and tell us your classic video game of the week.

1233
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:20,817
[SPEAKER_06]: My classic game of the week is one that I have brought up a number of times on the show, which is one of the greatest shooting games ever.

1234
01:20:22,379 --> 01:20:23,741
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Radiant Silvergun.

1235
01:20:25,082 --> 01:20:25,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

1236
01:20:25,743 --> 01:20:26,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Radiant Silvergun!

1237
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:31,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Radiant Silvergun is developed by Treasure.

1238
01:20:31,566 --> 01:20:39,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I have played this in the arcade, and I'm still trying to freaking find the Saturn copy, because, I mean, it's fucking Radiant Silvergun, hello.

1239
01:20:39,934 --> 01:20:52,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And the good thing about this game, this is one of the things that I always, always liked, is that you had, um, your weapons were all available at the same time, um, your different power-ups, um,

1240
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:56,905
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do a regular forward gun called the Vulcan.

1241
01:20:56,945 --> 01:21:02,470
[SPEAKER_06]: You had homing missiles and you had a spread burst effect.

1242
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:04,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you had like a lock-on spread.

1243
01:21:04,472 --> 01:21:09,256
[SPEAKER_06]: You had one that would shoot one beam in the front and then a ton of beams in the back.

1244
01:21:09,797 --> 01:21:13,841
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a plasma weapon that sort of reminds me a little bit more

1245
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:21,585
[SPEAKER_06]: of the weapon, the electricity weapon from Raiden DX, remember?

1246
01:21:22,286 --> 01:21:29,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Except it was very thin and it would be blocked by whatever, like different items that were in the way.

1247
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:36,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you had something called the Radiant Sword, which was a sword that could shoot out from either side.

1248
01:21:37,735 --> 01:21:39,476
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also a few...

1249
01:21:41,773 --> 01:21:45,554
[SPEAKER_06]: See, you didn't actually have your power to level up your current weapons.

1250
01:21:46,455 --> 01:21:55,678
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite ones in here is these two balls that come out right in front of you, but you shoot them out and they hover and then destroy whatever is in their way.

1251
01:21:56,478 --> 01:22:05,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also like this sword that comes out from behind and then comes out in a wide arc and claps together right in front.

1252
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:06,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a very cool thing.

1253
01:22:07,602 --> 01:22:09,063
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very bullet heavy.

1254
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:27,352
[SPEAKER_06]: and like the one level that Rob's playing on the feed right now is the whole level where you're fighting just this big ship that it rotates around you and moves and you have to move with it and it was a very very challenging game

1255
01:22:31,425 --> 01:22:42,234
[SPEAKER_06]: The Saturn version had a few different things as in it would have you play through all of the stages to unlock everything.

1256
01:22:45,365 --> 01:22:49,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like you were having to play it in chronological order, too.

1257
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:52,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very bizarre, because you start off at 3, then 2, then 4, 6, and then 1.

1258
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:57,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's all kinds of weirdness with it, but it's Treasure, so we expect weirdness from them.

1259
01:22:59,835 --> 01:23:09,181
[SPEAKER_06]: But you've also got four different characters to choose from, and each of them has their own little quirks and everything.

1260
01:23:09,221 --> 01:23:11,162
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got the cute girl and everything.

1261
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:11,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1262
01:23:13,884 --> 01:23:25,754
[SPEAKER_06]: The arcade mode would be played basically without the cutscenes or the dialogue, but there was a Saturn mode that did have a bit more story involved and had dialogue and stuff.

1263
01:23:25,954 --> 01:23:38,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's one whole stage that you play, and this has got dialogue running all through the first part of the stage, and it's that, you know, sort of old man voice saying, we did this back in the day, and somebody shot somebody, and there was a big war, and a lot of people died.

1264
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:39,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1265
01:23:40,966 --> 01:23:41,867
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Radiosilver.

1266
01:23:42,688 --> 01:23:43,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's freaking awesome.

1267
01:23:43,949 --> 01:23:46,672
[SPEAKER_05]: It's treasure.

1268
01:23:47,052 --> 01:23:50,576
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a shooter, but with uniqueness.

1269
01:23:50,876 --> 01:23:52,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how else to explain it.

1270
01:23:52,237 --> 01:23:52,778
[SPEAKER_06]: It's treasure.

1271
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:57,522
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing you can say about a treasure game is that it's freaking treasure.

1272
01:23:58,815 --> 01:24:09,041
[SPEAKER_06]: All of their games, where they may seem like a straightforward genre that you've seen 50 million times, they take something in it and innovate it.

1273
01:24:09,421 --> 01:24:14,643
[SPEAKER_06]: They do something that turns it around and makes it completely different.

1274
01:24:15,144 --> 01:24:21,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, they did Ikaruga, which, contrary to popular belief, is not a true sequel to Radiant Silvergun.

1275
01:24:21,607 --> 01:24:23,988
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of a spiritual sequel to Radiant Silvergun.

1276
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:45,571
[SPEAKER_06]: but I still honestly I think a Radiant Silvergun is superior to Ikaruga but that's me and if Treasure knows what's good for them we will be getting we will be getting more I guess re-releases of Radiant Silvergun and they'll give them directly to me and only you

1277
01:24:46,835 --> 01:25:09,873
[SPEAKER_06]: and GS68 points out something that I was going to mention is that Radiant Silvergun was inspired by Image Fight which was by IRM and that's the team that gave us, well the company that gave us R-Type and also completely unrelated to Radiant Silvergun but since I mentioned R-Type I have to say this is that if you order that R-Type strategy game you get an R-Type

1278
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:11,819
[SPEAKER_04]: We covered that last week, but that's alright.

1279
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:12,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one.

1280
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:13,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, very cool.

1281
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:13,780
[SPEAKER_04]: You like it?

1282
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

1283
01:25:14,121 --> 01:25:14,641
[SPEAKER_04]: How big is it?

1284
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:16,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, uh... We couldn't figure that out on last week's show.

1285
01:25:16,742 --> 01:25:17,783
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about three inches long.

1286
01:25:17,943 --> 01:25:18,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1287
01:25:18,424 --> 01:25:19,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fairly decent size.

1288
01:25:19,544 --> 01:25:22,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll bring it next week and put it on the cam so everyone can see.

1289
01:25:23,267 --> 01:25:23,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1290
01:25:23,907 --> 01:25:25,428
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know where I hate tactics games?

1291
01:25:26,249 --> 01:25:27,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Rortypes.

1292
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:30,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So it cancels each other out and you're ambivalent about the game.

1293
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:33,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I have an R-type thingy.

1294
01:25:33,933 --> 01:25:35,574
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, Radiant Silvergun is treasure.

1295
01:25:36,695 --> 01:25:40,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And I should do nothing but treasure games for the next couple weeks, but I don't know.

1296
01:25:41,196 --> 01:25:44,018
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the game I was actually going to originally do either.

1297
01:25:44,398 --> 01:25:50,580
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm going to have to help you out one of these weeks because I need to start seeing some Commodore 64 11 in these classic games of the week.

1298
01:25:51,241 --> 01:25:51,821
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's all right.

1299
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:53,061
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a lot of good games.

1300
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:54,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you do it next week?

1301
01:25:54,702 --> 01:25:54,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll wait.

1302
01:25:55,002 --> 01:25:56,463
[SPEAKER_06]: What system did Jamie not have?

1303
01:25:57,059 --> 01:25:57,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Commodore 64.

1304
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1305
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,901
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll wait for a week you're not here.

1306
01:26:00,561 --> 01:26:03,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they'll come up before the end of the year at some point.

1307
01:26:03,443 --> 01:26:05,525
[SPEAKER_05]: But is this not the most awesome thing ever?

1308
01:26:05,745 --> 01:26:06,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a very cool looking game.

1309
01:26:06,766 --> 01:26:07,806
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know a secret?

1310
01:26:07,826 --> 01:26:08,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never played this game.

1311
01:26:08,947 --> 01:26:09,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it.

1312
01:26:09,488 --> 01:26:11,589
[SPEAKER_06]: The only time I've actually played this game is in an arcade.

1313
01:26:11,689 --> 01:26:15,752
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whenever we actually get our little Justin TV idea off the ground, we need to do that.

1314
01:26:16,112 --> 01:26:16,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I need to play it.

1315
01:26:16,692 --> 01:26:17,833
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I did the very next day?

1316
01:26:17,933 --> 01:26:18,254
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1317
01:26:18,614 --> 01:26:19,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I had lunch with sauce.

1318
01:26:21,201 --> 01:26:22,341
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in Las Vegas.

1319
01:26:22,521 --> 01:26:24,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

1320
01:26:24,242 --> 01:26:25,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say that on the air.

1321
01:26:46,821 --> 01:26:47,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1322
01:26:47,742 --> 01:26:49,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And more gaming news.

1323
01:26:49,623 --> 01:26:50,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very full show tonight.

1324
01:26:51,004 --> 01:26:53,986
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
