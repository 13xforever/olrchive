With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, May 11th, 2008, the new Nintendo Channel is up and running,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Burnout Paradise is soon headed to the PC,

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the classic first-person shooter is about to get another sequel.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hi.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How are you?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm tired.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're tired?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's been a long weekend.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's been a long everything.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's been a hot weekend too, and I'm worried about next weekend

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
because it's supposed to be like 20 degrees hotter,

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and I'm like, we're going to die during the show,

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
so I've got to figure out air condition plans.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have a solution for you.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's that?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That window, does it have a screen?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It does have a screen on it.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So you can't do a little thingy, I know.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can kick that screen off there.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Take the screen off.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Put in the air conditioner, put a block over it.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's not that hard, see those little black things on there?

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's for pushing the screen off.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We'll see.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All right.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is now Home Improvement, the podcast.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, and on top of that.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What?

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's Studio Improvement.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The other voice you hear over there, Tech Master Loki,

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
since he's talking out of turn.

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's all right.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm talking intern.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But it's easy and cheap.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They're not expensive.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll figure something out.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's why we have a budget.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've got a week to figure it out.

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Which means I'll do something about it on Saturday.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll worry about it tomorrow.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And how are you doing, Loki?

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm doing fine.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah?

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Had a good week?

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I guess.

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All right.

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All things considered.

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You went out of town today, right?

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah.

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I went to Oakland, and then I came back from Oakland.

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And you're back alive.

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Amazing.

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oakland sucks.

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
All right.

70
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you want to join us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Remember All Games listeners?

72
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We actually don't use the same chat channel right now

73
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
as the other All Games shows.

74
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Maybe in the future.

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But for right now, we're in our own channel.

76
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's Orange Lounge is the channel name on the Game Surge Network.

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Or you just go to that website, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

78
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In fact, Act Deaf is in chat tonight,

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and he is calling it Orange Lounge Improvement Radio

80
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
because it's like improving the lounge in your house

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
or the lounge where I was at.

82
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All right. Forget it.

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Anyhow, lots of fun stuff on tonight's show.

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll tell you all about it.

85
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But first, we always start the show off with a little bit of

86
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
how was your gaming week?

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Dark soccer, how was your gaming week?

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Uh.

89
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That good, huh?

90
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Dan worked on the No Fear pinball today.

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And it is in now fully playable condition.

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And as soon as he finished up some last switch tweaks on it,

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
it will be good to go.

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I helped by taking pictures of stuff.

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a pinball table, and I helped.

96
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I, um, we also got, um, I don't know if I mentioned this last,

97
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
well, the week before.

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We got a Black Knight 2000 finally.

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Nice.

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And so the stickers for it arrived

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
because the play field's pretty trashed up right now.

102
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But, um, the only problem is that they gave us the

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Rung Magna Lock stickers so we have to get the right ones.

104
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And, um, I played more Ragnarok.

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And Dan's getting me the Iron Man game for Xbox 360.

106
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When's that out? Like next month?

107
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's already out.

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh. I guess that makes sense.

109
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Came out in time for the movie.

110
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I haven't been video game shopping in a while.

111
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have enough games to hold me over.

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm just gonna pretend that it's not dude, you know, playing him.

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not, what, Robert Downey Jr.?

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're not a big Robert? I thought you loved the movie.

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I do.

116
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But you just don't like him.

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, okay.

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Whatever.

119
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But I'm gonna take you to see it.

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I will. I will.

121
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We're going tomorrow.

122
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can do it tomorrow.

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We're going tomorrow.

124
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can do it tomorrow.

125
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't know, cause, um,

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh.

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, somebody's back in town tomorrow.

128
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I gotta go hang with them.

129
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We'll go Wednesday.

130
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Alright, we'll go this week.

131
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We will.

132
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I still kinda wanna see Speed Racer

133
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
even though everything I've heard about it is terrible.

134
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's fucking awesome.

135
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
A lot of people like it.

136
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Did you see it, Loki?

137
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It was awesome.

138
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Was it?

139
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
See, now I heard that you wouldn't like Speed Racer

140
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
unless you're a seven-year-old boy.

141
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I hate Speed Racer.

142
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I absolutely hate the cartoon, and I like the movie.

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
See, I like Speed Racer because it's done by Tatunoko Studios,

144
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and that's the place they gave us Gatchaman.

145
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's, it's, it gets, let me put it this way,

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it's like, uh, Willy Wonka with cars.

147
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's just really, it goes from varying levels of, like,

148
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
what the hell, to, you know, it's pretty cool.

149
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
There's a lot of stuff that they throw in there,

150
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you know, pretty awesome,

151
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and then there's a lot of stuff that they throw in just, you know,

152
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
because it's a family movie.

153
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I need to see Racer X.

154
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, see, the reason why I kinda wanted to see Speed Racer

155
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
is it looks like F-Zero, the movie, which is kind of awesome.

156
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Uh, not really, but it's cool.

157
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I mean, it's cool in its own right.

158
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
As long as the Mach 5 has all of its crap, I'm happy.

159
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You know, that's the game they need to make.

160
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I wanna see, like, a game like F-Zero,

161
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
but on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

162
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, there was, uh, Fatal Inertia, but that was kinda, eh.

163
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I wanna see something just, like, that'll just blow my mind

164
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
with how great the graphics are and all that.

165
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It was supposed to be blow-my-mind awesome,

166
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
but it was blow-my-mind average.

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So, I don't know.

168
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Anyways, uh, this week, I played a whole ton of Grand Theft Auto IV.

169
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Just a whole ton of it.

170
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Everything from the single player to, uh, multiplayer.

171
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Did some ranked multiplayer.

172
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm now level 2, and you can actually, um, you know,

173
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
rank up, I think, all the way to level 10.

174
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So, I have a long ways to go there.

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I like how they do it.

176
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's basically just experience or, I guess, uh,

177
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
money that you earn throughout the game.

178
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, you can play, you know, for quite a while.

179
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There's a few lag issues I ran into, but overall, it's pretty good.

180
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Um, I just absolutely love that game.

181
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What can I say?

182
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Um, other than Grand Theft Auto,

183
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I did get to play a few other games today.

184
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I played, uh, God of War Chains of Olympus,

185
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and that's pretty cool.

186
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I played mainly the demo before,

187
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
so it was nice to actually get to play the full game.

188
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And, um, you know, if you like God of War,

189
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you're gonna love this game.

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's absolutely amazing to see that they were able to put

191
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
a God of War game onto the PSP and not really sacrifice anything.

192
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So, that was pretty cool.

193
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Um, and then, of course, more Space Invaders Extreme,

194
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and that game's just, you know, all sorts of awesome.

195
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, uh, yeah, that's pretty much it.

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I've been trying this week to, um,

197
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
get around to playing Speed Racer for the Wii,

198
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and especially after last night,

199
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
it was funny because Nellie went and saw the movie with me,

200
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and she's like,

201
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Did they have a game for this?

202
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm like,

203
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, hold on, hold on.

204
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your wife, who hates games that aren't called Bejeweled or Zuma,

205
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
wanted to go buy a video game.

206
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
She likes Excite Truck.

207
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, yeah, I forgot she liked Excite Truck, too.

208
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, she said that this would be perfect

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
if they had Excite Truck, but with those tracks,

210
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
she's like, that would be perfect.

211
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm like, well, they have a game for it.

212
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not sure if it's like Excite Truck.

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm pretty sure it's not, but, you know, you can try it anyways.

214
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But does she like Mario Kart?

215
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
She hasn't played Mario Kart yet.

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't think she would.

217
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
She loves Excite Truck.

218
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Is your wife a fan of Monster Trucks or something?

219
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No, she just likes the gameplay of that,

220
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and I hope they announce a sequel,

221
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
because that game needs a sequel.

222
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Frisbee says Excite Truck should come down in price.

223
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It should.

224
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Has it not come down in price after all this time?

225
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't think so.

226
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Wow.

227
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's Excite Truck, so no.

228
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Amazing.

229
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
As far as I remember, it's not being sold anymore.

230
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right, so anything else for your gaming week?

231
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That was it.

232
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I've been trying to get around to playing Trackmania United,

233
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
so hopefully I'll get to play that this week.

234
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
My gaming week.

235
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I had a Wii Week, which is strange,

236
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
because the Wii went unloved for months and months,

237
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and then like Brawl came out,

238
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and I was playing that for a little while,

239
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and then Mario Kart came out, and I've been playing that,

240
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and I already talked about it last week.

241
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I continue to play it this week, and I think,

242
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you know what, I think this is my favorite Mario Kart

243
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
since the original.

244
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think it really is.

245
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Like, even though the online is, you know, janky,

246
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
because Nintendo made it, and, you know,

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
they don't nearly have the online competency

248
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that, like, Microsoft has,

249
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the online does add a really fun element into it.

250
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I've got to say, if you have your computer there,

251
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and you're able to network the friends together

252
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
to get the game online going,

253
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
because just impromptu, last night,

254
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I was on Justin.tv just randomly,

255
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
because I had said I was going to do the

256
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
every extend extra extreme with Space Invaders music,

257
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and somehow that turned into playing Mario Kart Wii

258
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
against four Orange Hans Radio listeners

259
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
who joined me for an online match,

260
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and it was a lot of fun.

261
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I had a lot of fun playing Mario Kart online with them.

262
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Of course, I won.

263
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I made it even more fun.

264
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, I lost battle mode, though.

265
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They whooped me in battle, but I won the race mode.

266
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't like battle mode.

267
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not as cool as it used to be.

268
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The battle mode is not nearly as cool as it used to be,

269
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but the game, I'd consider versus mode like the game itself,

270
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and that's great.

271
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I love the courses.

272
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I love the new courses.

273
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
They're all so good.

274
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Still, I stand by not really caring for their selection

275
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
of retro courses that they brought back.

276
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I would agree with you to a point.

277
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The thing is that the GameCube one,

278
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I didn't play a lot of,

279
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
so I'm glad they brought some of those really good courses over,

280
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
like the Volcano one.

281
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's one of my favorite stages.

282
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't think they call it Volcano,

283
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
because there's another Volcano,

284
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
but it's like Donkey Kong's Jungle or something,

285
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
but it was the GameCube one.

286
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You get shot up this giant mountain,

287
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and then you race down it.

288
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I love that track.

289
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
See, that's the thing.

290
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That was so similar to the snowboarding one.

291
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That was also a Donkey Kong-themed thing.

292
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't know.

293
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I really think that there was a few tracks in there

294
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
that they should have brought in.

295
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Maybe had taken a vote or something.

296
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
See, but here's the thing.

297
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If Nintendo was smart about their online strategy,

298
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
they would have downloadable tracks,

299
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and they could do more retro stuff.

300
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes, and that's a key phrase, if they were smart.

301
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But the thing is, they're not,

302
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and they're playing it way too damn safe,

303
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and there's not going to be downloadable content

304
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
available for these games for quite a while.

305
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And there is one game,

306
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and that's coming up in the show role about download content.

307
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I know that there's a service that they already unveiled it

308
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
or announced it,

309
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but it's not being implemented until the summer.

310
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, here's the other weird thing,

311
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
is that they've got another problem on that Wii to figure out,

312
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and that's the fact that I ran out of space on my Wii this week.

313
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Now, granted, I've downloaded, like,

314
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
craploads of virtual console games,

315
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
because I'm a whore for retro games,

316
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and, you know, every channel they released,

317
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and when I finally copied the Mario Kart channel,

318
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
or I wanted to, or no, no,

319
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I copied the Mario Kart channel,

320
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and then when that new channel came out this week

321
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that we're going to talk about later,

322
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I ran out of space.

323
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I couldn't install it.

324
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I had to go back and delete.

325
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So I've already filled up my Wii,

326
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and WiiWare's not even up yet.

327
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So they've got a storage problem on top of everything.

328
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't know how the hell I'm going to fit

329
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
download content on that thing.

330
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Luckily, the WiiWare games aren't that large.

331
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Like, under 48 megs.

332
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I mean, I'm going to have to copy

333
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
the virtual console games to my card

334
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and copy them over one on a player.

335
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's just such a hassle.

336
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well...

337
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
One little patch is all it would take

338
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to use that SD card as a normal, like, memory.

339
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Seriously.

340
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yep, and that's Nintendo, though, for you.

341
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If it works as a hassle patch, okay for us.

342
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Just like the Friends codes.

343
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It works, but it's a hassle.

344
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Mr. Bobby Blackwolf, the man that, uh,

345
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
precedes us on All Games Radio on Sunday nights

346
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
when we tape live.

347
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He goes live at 5 o'clock Pacific.

348
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He's calling me out.

349
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He says, I would beat you, Sky.

350
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, I see that challenge, Mr. Blackwolf.

351
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We'll set up a challenge this week at some point.

352
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm actually not that great at Mario Kart.

353
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I want to play.

354
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay.

355
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, I'll play.

356
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hey, this can be the ChromeHounds event

357
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
that never was.

358
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well, I'm not that great at Mario Kart,

359
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but I'll play.

360
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We'll play. It'll be fun.

361
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Alright, Bobby.

362
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's set up a time.

363
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Especially, you know, and that's another thing

364
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that I don't really care about this Mario Kart,

365
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and the fact that, you know, the AI is retarded

366
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and the item selection's also retarded,

367
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
because when you're up in the first place,

368
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
you get nothing, and when you're in the last place,

369
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
it's like, blue shell, blue shell, blue shell, blue shell.

370
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So...

371
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah.

372
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Blue shells need to die to fire.

373
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Other Nintendo games I've been playing this week,

374
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I picked up a game for $15 at Costco.

375
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's the Williams Pinball Table Collection.

376
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't think that's the actual name of the game.

377
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I apologize, but it's...

378
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can't miss it.

379
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's the pinball collection featuring

380
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
all the Williams tables.

381
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So not only did Dark Soccer have a pinball week,

382
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I did too, and I played the shit at a pinbot.

383
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That was awesome to get to play that again.

384
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And for the value, considering I only paid $15 for it,

385
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and I imagine it's $19.99 normally,

386
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
because Costco, you know, marks everything down,

387
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
it's not a bad deal at all.

388
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
With all the tables you get in there,

389
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
you have a lot of retro tables in there.

390
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, when you consider the pinball FX

391
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
on Xbox Live is $10, and they're very similar,

392
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
but in the case of the Wii 1, you get to play

393
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
kind of games you remember and love.

394
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's kind of cool.

395
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I got to tell you, the control scheme is kind of funny.

396
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Like, funny in a good way.

397
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What you do, you use the Wii and the nunchuk,

398
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I mean the Wiimote and the nunchuk.

399
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And the trigger on the Wiimote is the right flipper,

400
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and then the little trigger on the nunchuk

401
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
is the left flipper.

402
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So, actually, you were, like, pulling little triggers

403
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
to move the flippers.

404
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's kind of cute.

405
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And then the little controller thingy

406
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,320
thingy on the nunchuck is the thing that you pull back to launch the ball.

407
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,440
So it's kind of neat and it's interesting because they built achievements into the game

408
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
which I think is interesting.

409
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,880
Like if you get a thousand points or I mean a hundred thousand points on this table then

410
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,600
you get a credit to play the tournament games which I thought was kind of cute.

411
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
So they thought a waste.

412
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,860
I think it's good that they have that on the analog just because there's like for example

413
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,360
pinball like you were saying has the spiral on it to where it's not the very top one it's

414
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,800
like the second to last one gives you more points.

415
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Right skill shots.

416
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Yeah.

417
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,400
Tons of pinball games have skill shots so the older ones not so much it was just kind

418
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,800
of about which shoot would it go down to but yeah pinball and some of the other later ones

419
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,920
but it's got some great tables in it.

420
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,840
A whirlwind remember that one that one was fun where the thing we almost bought a whirlwind

421
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,360
oh but the the good thing about whirlwind though is that you actually want to have the

422
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,600
real table for that so that when you go inside after being outside all day yes it blows the

423
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
wind at you.

424
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
I know.

425
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
And fortunately the Wii doesn't do that.

426
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Sad.

427
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
But it was good times.

428
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
So.

429
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
So what else was all on that collection?

430
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,680
Oh gosh I got I Black Knight I know was there Taxi AJ Mixx is pointing out in chat I guess

431
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,520
they looked it up let's see actually actdeft is linking me to a page that has more information

432
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,200
about the game because I'm too lazy to go grab my copy of the game it has some really

433
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,520
old tables in it too like what is the one there's almost like a giant Satan on it that's

434
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,920
a very there's it's a very early early table on it as long as it doesn't have hyper ball

435
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
then I'm okay.

436
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,080
Gorgar the first ever talking pinball machine that's the one with like Satan on it Space

437
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,960
Shuttle is on there too yeah I'm looking at the list good times so let's see which of

438
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:59,000
these I own no I'm kidding but seriously for the value it's a great value you know especially

439
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,640
when you consider there's a very comparable game where the tables aren't quite as memorable

440
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,120
I mean don't get me wrong I like pinball FX but it's not quite as memorable as some of

441
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,840
these tables I mean they're classic tables for a reason so no sadly the Tommy table is

442
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,880
not in the game DJ Dark Knight so the Tommy table is freaking awesome if you like pinball

443
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,080
at all it's worth the money to get this for the Wii it's fun that's that's my thoughts

444
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,720
it was the big thing about Black Knight the Magna save mm-hmm mm-hmm they sent us the

445
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,740
wrong Magna save stickers alright so that's gonna do it for my gaming week because otherwise

446

471
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:55,480
news we had a lot this week take it away Loki yes of course as Rob was mentioning when he

472
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,240
tried to install the Nintendo channel his Wii said no you're out of space but I the

473
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,720
Nintendo channel or as it's known in Japan everybody's a Nintendo channel fuck that's

474
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,520
my Nintendo channel now is available on the Wii I will allow you to rate different games

475
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,760
include I think we we were games virtual console and full Wii games after you played them for

476
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,840
an hour as well as there's gonna be some I think video that you can watch of different

477
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,580
games I think the coolest thing though that you'll probably see though available for it

478
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:35,340
is DS demo downloads which is pretty awesome and you can stream those to your DS just like

479
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:43,180
a you know download station so go check it out it's absolutely free and who doesn't like

480
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:49,960
demos free if you sell your soul to Nintendo yes yes because you have to agree that the

481
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,880
thing will I don't know monitor what the hell to do it's sending like anonymous you should

482
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,920
jet usage data about the games you've been playing so like you know you know how the

483
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,760
weeds been secretly compiling the amount of time you can go to that note in your board

484
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,920
you can see how long you've been playing the games well that information gets sent to Nintendo

485
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:12,080
and in turn you get the list of DS games like you don't do it no games no DS demos for you

486
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,640
I mean I don't know like I'm not too worried about it I gladly clicked yes I mean I don't

487
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,440
care I mean seriously what is Nintendo gonna do knowing that some you know Shmo in Sacramento

488
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,640
California it was playing way too much and I know that I like your site truck and then

489
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,900
we'll go hey people like excite truck let's make another one and that's not a bad thing

490
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,440
I think it's fairly smart of them to have something like that enacted it's a good way

491
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:43,280
to I think it's a good non intrusive way I think to for market research exactly this

492
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,160
isn't like EA where it's like hey we've got your credit card number we want to know what

493
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,600
you're buying true I don't think Nintendo saves your credit card information you have

494
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,960
to input it every freaking time you know so once again you know it works but it's an inconvenience

495
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,560
you know so what did you did you actually check out the channel I checked out the channel

496
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,000
not download it didn't even plug it in too busy playing Grand Theft Auto 4 I did download

497
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,280
it and it wasn't quite as cool as I had hoped they have some videos on there which is kind

498
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,120
of interesting to see on the Wii isn't that just a recurring theme with the Wii wasn't

499
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,720
quite as cool as I had hoped no I don't know it just you know I do think the concept of

500
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,160
turning it into a DS demo station that was kind of cool because it was cool like I downloaded

501
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,020
the brain H2 jump demo just for the hell of it okay seriously it was interesting yes I'm

502
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,520
glad it's it's an interesting thing it's also something they talked about III prior to the

503
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,680
we launching that this was already supposed to have happened at launch what's taking them

504
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:48,400
so long I mean seriously what is taking them so long to implement this crap it's like oh

505
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,320
well eventually we'll get a unified you know online service and stuff oh great I'm glad

506
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,040
that you're catching up to Microsoft it'll only be a few years now well maybe they just

507
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,160
had some fine-tuning to do or something or maybe they just kind of rushed the we out

508
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,120
there and now they you know there's only so many people that work there the people are

509
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,880
interested in online what are they talking about Xbox Live statistics are bullshit they're

510
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,620
pulling out of their ass with all right I'm looking at chat here act F says I like the

511
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,320
channel I like the demos AJ mix says demos is pretty much the high point and it has the

512
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:31,240
commercial that has the kid that says I am mudkip I miss that I have to go back and look

513
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,680
I mean I was thinking like wow be kind of cool if there was like a YouTube is channel

514
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,560
or cute little viral things could be on there but then I'm thinking oh but there's the internet

515
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,600
channel so I could just go to YouTube on the internet channel why bother and then four

516
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:53,680
hours later you'll be able to watch the latest viral videos exactly all right other stuff

517
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:59,200
going on in the Wii world and a lot of fanboys including myself have been eagerly anticipating

518
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,380
the release someday of Kid Icarus on the Wii and here's the thing is that it may have actually

519
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,360
been spoiled this week by IGN you know that guy over at IGN who's you know him he's like

520
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,680
the quintessential Nintendo fanboy not that that's an issue but he's just is Matt Casa

521
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,260
Casa mass enough that as they say his name Casa role Casa Massena all right he probably

522
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,860
heard that like a million times in the third grade Loki come on all right so this guy he

523
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,600
was in the IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast first off Nintendo has voice chat that's amazing

524
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:42,140
they name all their podcasts after stuff like they have was it the I want to say ring red

525
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:48,360
ring of death is their Xbox 360 podcast nice oh I see so they make one they make fun of

526
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,100
the system in their name like you know and then the PlayStation 3 crayon eating cast

527
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,560
I don't know all right fine whatever the IGN Nintendo voice chat podcast he says in this

528
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,160
of course Nintendo is gonna have some e3 surprises you know Kid Icarus for crying out loud how

529
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,760
many times we have to say it it's coming out for crying out loud so you know and you kind

530
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,920
of think this guy might kind of know something going on on the inside because usually you

531
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,680
know these really big gaming sites are kind of in on what's the no it really wouldn't

532
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,460
suppose there's been little breadcrumb clues to that this is gonna happen a he showed up

533
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,320
in brawl that should be a big clue right there I honestly think that's a clue and we heard

534
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,680
that what was it Factor five I think was developing an unknown game that was suspected to be this

535
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:39,080
so and then I guess on the next show the same guy he actually said Kid Icarus that's another

536
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,620
one I'm really anticipating just because I love the franchise and I'm sure the developer

537
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,400
will make a really pretty game so he said it twice that it's coming so it is maybe if

538
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I keep seeing stuff it'll come to some things say they're coming and never do so all right

539
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,080
well I can't I can't wait for I cannot wait for compile to reform and have a booth at

540
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,880
E3 this year and announce Guardian Legend 2 I can't wait for that that's that's going

541
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,000
to be the show right there was a Guardian Legend 2 so we want Guardian Legend 3 what

542
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,360
was Guardian Legend 2 the Guardian Legend that we got over here in the US oh oh yeah

543
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,720
first one was Guardic or whatever so just let you know just get together and make a

544
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,040
new game that is like Zelda plus shooter and that would be awesome all right and let's

545
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,360
see what now something that didn't make our little list but I know I saw it on the internet

546
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,420
there was like some concept artwork that supposedly leaked although I don't know some of it kind

547
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,880
of screamed fanboy to me no it was actually it was stuff that they're it was a company

548
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,760
pitching the idea of a Kid Icarus game they set up a bunch of different shots hmm but

549
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,880
like it was weird because if you've seen the shots pit looks all like buff well they have

550
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,920
a bunch of different styles of shots and stuff so it's not just that super buff one that

551
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:03,200
you're seeing and it was from a website come combo with K mm-hmm and I guess not to be

552
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,240
confused with zombo there was another website that had some stuff but uh they said that

553
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,160
I guess it was supposedly from Factor 5 where those pieces are working and they have a but

554
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,480
like I said a bunch of different shots there's some that look really realistic there's one

555
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,960
that looks like a really shitty cartoon there's some emo shots something that looks like it

556
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,440
might been out of like Kingdom Hearts you know just like a whole bunch of stuff but

557
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,780
yeah some of it looks a little bit fanboyish but it's slowly a fact that the Kid Icarus

558
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,000
game would be coming to we in the first place is a little fanboyish don't you think it is

559
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,960
I hey I will be first in line to pre-order and then thusly buy this game well because

560
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,160
I love the original 8-bit that much well you know since they have the characters from mother

561
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:57,880
in there maybe mother threes coming here haha no why you gotta why you gotta be a dick yeah

562
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,720
I'm not the one that's saying hey let's localize a game for Europe and I'll bring it to the

563
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:10,840
US all right let's move on with some more stories import time FTW anywho um for those

564
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:17,320
who have been waiting for WiiWare we have a bit of a release from Nintendo giving us some ideas

565
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,120
that are going of what's definitely going to be out for the launch of WiiWare and if you are ready

566
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:32,440
I has them okay defender castle will be 500 we points pop for 700 we points VIP casino blackjack

567
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:40,240
for 700 TV show king for a thousand whatever what TV show I think that's a trivia game for a

568
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,360
thousand point defending now I like to fend your castle and that's 500 points in a TV show King

569
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,800
all right they're gonna be like seen it lost wins for a thousand I like it pretty good and

570
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,200
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles my life as a king for 15 that I'm not too sure if it looked

571
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,040
good or not I'm not buying that at a protest there's no dr. Mario I thought dr. Mario got

572
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:11,200
what was like a late add to the list or something yeah it's coming I need to throw pills at by right

573
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:19,640
and you could do it on the internet yes we'll be fun another game not coming to WiiWare but

574
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:27,840
coming to the Wii and this is a pretty interesting rumor apparently there are a couple links coming

575
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:36,840
from I guess some Brazilian sites the first one talking a little bit about Castlevania for the

576
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,800
Wii a second link also coming from another Brazilian site apparently has some I guess

577
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:51,600
quotes from Shinji Harano and the executive VP for Konami USA stating that a Castlevania titles

578
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:58,640
were headed to the Wii and DS he says that we'll learn more information about these titles come

579
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:06,080
next week when Konami is holding a press event in the US god damn it where's my invite for this shit

580
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,280
seriously now they promised us that when a Castlevania game was going to be coming that

581
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,880
you would not actually have to use the Wii mode as a whip right because that would be the most

582
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:24,480
hokey thing ever yeah it doesn't really say anything about that though but I if I were to

583
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:32,320
guess I would say you probably use the Wii mode as a whip all right anyhow moving on to other

584
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,520
Nintendo news Wii Fit we still don't have this game in the US but it's come out in Japan it's

585
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,840
come out in the UK see now this is Nintendo playing a little game with us called here's

586
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:50,240
what the UK feels like all the time with this game oh darn I can't get Wii Fit so sad oh well

587
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,760
least I had brawl early and some you know Mario Kart and we're really sure you don't need Wii Fit

588
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,920
I'm pretty sure you sure you already bought Wii Fit okay so shut up that's with you I have

589
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:07,640
Wii Fit it's on order it's paid for I just wait all right rare that roughly your feathers there

590
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,680
lucky all right so here's the thing is that Wii Fit is already causing a little bit of controversy

591
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,920
okay here's the thing is that there's this poster and the poster post on this website the DIS boards

592
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:26,440
and this is what they said that the Wii Fit basically crushed one girl's dreams this is it

593
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,320
quote my relative came around this weekend and we let her play on our Wii Fit we've all laughed

594
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,020
and joked about being told that we're fat and need to lose weight but I was gobsmacked when

595
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,960
it told her that she is overweight apparently it was this ten-year-old girl who is four foot

596
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,760
nine and she weighs six stone that's you know healthy all right and apparently we we judgment

597
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,360
called her overweight and the girl was really upset and they had to kind of like calm her down

598
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,920
and the quote continues I know it's just a game but seriously we already have to worry about young

599
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,080
girls starving themselves to look like magazine models and now we have a game that tells them

600
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:10,120
they're fat is this is this gonna be a problem when this game comes out over here question who

601
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:17,640
actually uses the weight measurement of stone in Europe that's retarded she weighs 84 pounds okay

602
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:24,720
yeah and she was so upset about being called fat she ate the board for not for nine and being 84

603
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,880
pounds that's not really no it's not it you know it is unfortunate and for being 10 years old yeah

604
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,560
you have to remember though it is just a game I mean I kind of compare this to the fact that

605
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,880
in brain training like when you try to say blue it doesn't pick it up you go blue blue and it doesn't

606
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,480
listen to you and you go brew and it listens to you you know what I'm not a lot of starving

607
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,720
herself in order to become a model you know nowadays it's a competitive market out there

608
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,160
and just a fit is telling the truth actually they've actually been sort of showing a trend

609
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,440
lately now where the super skinny you know rail thin model is no longer being considered

610
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,480
attractive by a lot of companies that's all right I know what I get we fit it's not gonna say I'm

611
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:16,680
overweight it's gonna say get off me being thin causes cancer haven't you heard that is the new

612
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,380
thing actually they actually um there's plenty of studies showing right now and by the way her BMI

613
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:28,640
is only 18.2 which also BMI is bullshit it was created by somebody in the 1800s to do a study

614
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:38,720
of body masses in Poland I'm not joking so anyway anyway um the the whole thing now is that they're

615
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,700
actually the studies are out there saying that it's better to be quote overweight and active

616
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:52,560
than be rail thin and inactive gs68 says love handles greater than exposed ribs oh hell yeah

617
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,440
I mean you gotta have something to grab on to you know I don't want to you know I wouldn't want to

618
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,640
date some guy that I had to you know if I grabbed a hold of him I'd like poke a hole through my hand

619
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:12,160
by his hip bone or ow I know I think sorry skeletons aren't sexy skeletons belong in a

620
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,720
grave and I always pronounce mispronounce his name in chat I apologize I'm Hippolytus says

621
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,240
brain training 2 has no blue well that's good that might make the sequel worth it alone cuz

622
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,560
I'll tell you that blue thing was very frustrating but alright so hopefully I don't know maybe

623
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,360
they're tweaking the game so that it doesn't you know tell people they're overweight over

624
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,600
here cuz I'll tell you what there's a lot of Americans who are like pussies and and they're

625
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,080
gonna really be upset if you think one ten-year-old girls all you got over there it's awesome they

626
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:52,760
spent $100 on this game and then they go home and cry oh really yeah I took the game to tell you

627
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,800
that so this is what you need it so listeners and everybody that's gonna be buying this game

628
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,880
here in America this is your this is your chance to practice your attitude okay cuz you know you

629
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,520
got to have attitude so here's the thing is that when the game tells you that you're fat you go I

630
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:14,080
am and that's more of me to love you just have to yell back at the game now the whole the whole

631
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,320
point is just you know to just get out and do something that's the whole reason why I think

632
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:28,200
that we fit exists is just so that you're not sitting around playing a game you're up and doing

633
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:35,480
something I think I think that it doesn't matter what a game that is not that first of all does not

634
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:42,400
see what you look like does not know who you are has no concept of what your life is like giving

635
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,000
you a judgment based off of arbitrary information that has been entered into its programming to

636
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,080
judge you by this is called you know what suck it up that's what it's called or to quote Dennis

637
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:02,280
Leary shut the fuck up we need a sequel called we fat that's specifically for like you know fat

638
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,760
and fabulous people that should be that should be like the sequel well at the point of the game is

639
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,040
just to get up and do something no and then in seriously are seriously that's kind of been I

640
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,720
mean that's why the we has sold gazillions of consoles as it is and we sports is because we

641
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,440
has that persona of oh it's a video game but you get up and you do things and you play I mean come

642
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,240
on you that's what I don't when I'm playing it look I'm not talking about you or necessarily the

643
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,880
hardcore gamers I'm talking about the soccer mom of the world their perception of this when they

644
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,920
see it on TV and they see it at friends houses at parties and things they see people up and they see

645
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:48,280
kids jumping around and swinging the tennis racket or believing they are whatever I've really actually

646
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,880
I'm kind of been enjoying this trend from Nintendo lately where their games aren't just about fun

647
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,800
they're about fun plus improvement it's cut yeah it's kind of like brain training mm-hmm or you

648
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,480
know we've got our Wii games that get us up and moving Konami has had their similar games too I

649
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,360
think it's more or less there's been all this complaining about oh video games you know rot

650
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,360
your mind and you know you sit on the couch and don't do anything and blah blah blah blah blah

651
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:23,560
but now they're making doing something exercising your intelligence working your brain working your

652
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,440
body they're making it fun I don't think so I think this is the whole it's basically they're

653
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,960
following the money they're trying to figure out what gimmicky things they can do to get people

654
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,600
that normally play games to play these things and buy them I mean that's why they're focusing on the

655
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,880
brain training stuff because people think oh it'll make me smarter I I need I need to be smarter

656
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,120
because smarter is good and then you know the whole like Mario Kart and that stupid wheel

657
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:55,280
attachment oh well that's pretty neat let me get that game it's like I'm driving a real car except

658
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,600
you're not and then you know just like the Wii Fit oh make me I'll make me all fit I cuz you know

659
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,320
I could use a good workout and then they'll come out with something else that's retarded and people

660
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,560
will buy it too and that's their target audience they don't give a shit about improving anybody

661
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,880
all they care about is improving the amount of people that use their system and buy their

662
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:22,600
products that is it I thought that we fit looked kind of fun I I'm gonna buy it I got the whole

663
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,240
reason that I would want to play it is just because it looks fun and I like doing active

664
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,320
things I I have to admit that's kind of the reason why I'm gonna get it too is that yeah it will kind

665
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,120
of get me off the couch how long it will last though that's the question I want to still want

666
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:42,280
to reenact DD overnight comments in chat Hippolytus says brain age tells you you're dumb we fit tells

667
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,560
you you're fat Gerardo mo says both of them together tell you you're fat and dumb and Nintendo

668
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:56,160
is about demoralization apparently so hey quilt hippo says can we have soul training please they

669
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,480
should they should have we we morals there's something like that wheel of morality turn turn

670
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,880
turn show us the lesson that we should learn that's the lesson is that's the game they need on we

671
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,720
they need some type of moral moral lesson game and every kid in America should play already we

672
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,360
already get other people's moral shot on our throat every time your game's doing it well I

673
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:25,040
forgot to mention um I think this week too I know it wasn't on that launch list but I'm pretty

674
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,560
positive that it's one of the we wear launch titles remember there's also the major league

675
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:36,980
eating game that comes out as well so you know got a game for the fat people got a game for the

676
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,480
people that don't want to be fat anymore oh my gosh I'm looking at Justin TV chat and one of our

677
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:49,320
listeners in Japan Akuma JP says they do have we moral there it's Japanese tradition training

678
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:55,800
they actually do have a game like that in Japan that's great of a cultural and that's all it needs

679
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,360
to be here too I don't think they should have morals down throat but they should you know have

680
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:09,800
you know common sense type things you know like you know sense don't call people ugly names good

699
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,960
well tippos readying his man beam says ready your man beam Tony oh sorry well there's this

700
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,360
company that's matrix software you may not know them by their you know company name but you know

701
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:46,080
them from their games they have done the Final Fantasy 3 remake for the DS and are working on

702
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:53,120
the Final Fantasy 4 remake for the DS well now they're working on their own game as well called

703
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:03,560
Alundra and are I hell with that Alundra it was a fun RPG yes it was originally I guess released

704
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:11,120
on the US on the PlayStation by working designs and wait that's just remake of another game then

705
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:19,040
that's not even a new game well whatever anyways art was done by Toriyama it says the latest

706
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:27,520
project I guess is another original piece this time from marvelous and it's called Avalon code

707
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,160
is the new game I guess because they did the London for the PlayStation and Avalon code it

708
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,080
doesn't really say what it is but of course it's gonna be kind of done in the similar style as you

709
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,200
know the Final Fantasy remakes you know kind of a 3d type of game they said with the art style

710
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,920
similar to Crystal Chronicles so yeah not Alundra they're not doing a new Alundra game but Avalon

711
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:57,720
code is a new game it looks spiffy so we're not getting a London no no London that they did they

712
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:04,200
originally I guess developed a London for the PlayStation but they're not okay I get it now

713
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:13,360
my my mistake well new DS colors abound and in the US it was just a matter of time before this

714
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,680
color made its way over here it is it's a rumor right now though it's coming from some GameStop

715
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:28,520
insiders so what if the color is metallic rose is supposed to be coming over here that is absolutely

716
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,680
the first time I've ever heard of that really absolutely first absolutely first time pretty

717
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:44,720
sure this has never been mentioned on the show before right never also over in Germany some

718
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,680
German retailers have also listed some other DS light colors that are supposed to be coming out

719
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:56,120
in Europe and that is light blue red and green and they all come with matching stylus colors and you

720
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,600
know with the metallic rose being such a pink girly color mm-hmm I wouldn't be surprised if

721
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,360
they maybe I don't know got rid of pink or something hmm yeah so like they might be good

722
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,840
to get rid of pink all together yeah that maybe cuz you know I mean what's the point I mean there's

723
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,520
not that many girls out there that need a new system and metallic rose that's just that'll do

724
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,920
just fine I agree it will there be a comparable boy color coming out to you I don't I don't know

725
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,600
about that I mean cuz you've got black and white it takes a real man to enjoy pink I know I want

726
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:35,040
metallic rose metallic rose now sans you know was it nintendo screening your color I want hmm I want

727
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,600
death metal black Gerardo mo once sparkle in our chat room I'll be great I like sparkles I want

728
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:48,320
death metal black like chrome no I want like red black how about see through have red black they

729
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,200

730
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:00,240
obsidian get a red get a red black DS and set it far away you know I could get a dark black DS and

731
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,760
then use like transparent red paint on it and customize it myself you could I like customize

732
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,760
my DS you know if you go to the Nintendo store they sell those custom DS as you can get in all

733
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,400
those different colors I almost I would like so million I came so close to buying one because I

734
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:20,040
am a consumer and how maybe that's all spend my stimulus check on I'll fly to New York and buy

735
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,720
one of those DS's I'm just gonna customize my own I'll make my own skins I'm not really gonna do

736
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,720
that by the way all right let's get to some Rob I am crazy let's get to some release dates we'll

737
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:39,120
start off in the UK Jamie sweet release dates we have on the 14th assault heroes 2 on Xbox 360 on

738
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:49,200
the 16th is the rest of these we have de blob on we have dream pinball per PC and for we Iron Man

739
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:57,480
on PC Perry Rodan on PC whatever that is Silent Hill origins on PlayStation 2 and you all have

740
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:04,240
to get it now or at least on the 16th and then supreme ruler 2020 which is a game about me I

741
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,680
think dark soccer I think dark soccer should do like commercials for gaming companies you know

742
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,400
de blob look pretty good they're kind of comparing it to like a katamari tip game hmm just with paint

743
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:25,440
I'd have to see a demo it looked cool look cool in the US there's not a whole lot coming out of

744
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,940
this week I guess it would be an exciting week if you liked I don't know Chronicle and Narnia

745
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,600
Prince Caspian because there's a few games coming out for that well I wouldn't have to do with the

746
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,980
movie coming out this weekend or maybe yeah yeah 360 DS PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 I believe the

747
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:47,520
Wii version is coming out next week for some reason this week though we've also got castle

748
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,760
of shikigami 3 if you like your really crazy shooter games you know kind of similar like

749
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:02,240
Ikaruga that's probably worth the $29.99 deca sports which we showed off on this show here a

750
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,520
little bit that's coming out this week as well also another $29.99 pretty cheap there we ski

751
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:15,120
also another $30 game that's supposed to be pretty fun little skiing game also supporting

752
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:23,600
the Wii balance boards so you can lean on that that's kind of cool drone tactics for the DS kind

753
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:32,440
of a weird mechanical insect tactical game from Atlas and then we've got missed for the DS which

754
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:41,480
you know just missed and you know it's it's just missed it's just missed yeah and I believe that's

755
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,680
pretty much it I think for this week remember that hilarious theme song the deca sports game

756
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:53,040
had oh my god we need to get that that's funny that's in our Justin TV archive by the way if you

757
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,000
go to a Justin TV and you get back in the archive you can find that that was the best part about

758
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,120
that game was the really weird theme song that they had the game was kind of fun it was like

759
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:08,480
Wii Sports it's almost like a Wii Sports 2 in a way almost it's like a fun little party game

760
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,520
doesn't have that Nintendo touch I can't explain it but you know see well Nintendo just doesn't

761
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:22,800
have you know the really cool cheesy theme song so all right let's move over to Japan and look at

762
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,560
what kind of releases are coming out over in Japan not a ton of stuff this week but better

763
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,800
than last week we're like nothing came out the darkness makes its way to the Xbox 360 this week

764
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:39,880
that's really the only big release on the Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 not a lot for you this week

765
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,280
although there's a couple things next week but I'll tell you about those next week coming out on

766
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:53,120
the Nintendo Wii Totsugeki Famicom Wars versus you might know that as Battalion Wars 2 that is

767
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,440
coming out on the Nintendo Wii and it's not price reduction because I thought they had that way

768
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:04,760
before us um no they want if you want to import it it's gonna cost you 65 bucks so I don't think

769
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,480
that's a price reduction huh I thought they had that a long time ago you know it's weird Japan

770
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,180
has been getting some releases like kind of maybe they're like releasing them or something

771
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:23,600
perhaps on the PlayStation 2 always Shiro is coming out and that also is getting a limited

772
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,160
edition version coming out it is let's see what this game looks like it looks like some type of

773
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:36,460
RPG I'm thinking no I don't know it has a little cutscenes that based on anime there's no actual

774
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:41,560
game screens I can find just cutscene I'm gonna guess it's a dating maybe it's a dating sim when

775
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,280
in doubt dating sim no it's an it's some type of adventure game that's the category it falls into

776
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:53,600
okay let's see also coming out a slaughter up core 10 mock go go go to that is and that's

777
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:03,440
slaughter SLO tter not like murder with a pickaxe that is speed racer it looks like because it has

778
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:12,920
the guy from speed racer on the cover yeah classic racer so some type of game oh god it's like a slot

779
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,640
machine game that has a good slide and speed eraser how lame it looks like you unlock clips

780
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,360
from speed racer as you play the slot machine well my hopes for that game went way down fast

781
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:32,280
I was gonna mention also this week on Xbox live arcade we're getting assault heroes 2 nice which

782
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:42,640
look okay the first one's alright and rocket man it came from Uranus that's on a 360 or Xbox live

783
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:49,920
arcade and the PlayStation Network this week so mature we are here at orange launch radio yeah

784
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,800
if you have rockets coming out Uranus you might have a problem rocket man it came from Uranus

785
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:06,720
coming out on the Nintendo DS dungeon of wind aria luminous art 2 and mahjong navi ds yet another

789
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:37,480
very interesting yet fun news for us is that burnout paradise is going to have a PC release

790
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:47,200
and criterion said okay here so they're going to be actually rebuilding it so that it works pretty

791
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,560
well on PC they're in enhancing multiplayer they're doing community content online features

792
00:50:53,560 --> 00:51:04,200
and resolution is at night 1920 by 2400 and is pretty much straight from the original I'm kind

793
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:14,000
of curious what community features is going to entail sex somehow doubt that sex somebody break

794
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:22,840
dark soccer this week what is up I guess all right well that that should be interesting see the sick

795
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,520
thing is now I'm actually picturing that like how would that work in burnout paradise I don't know

796
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:34,040
brings a whole new meaning to take me down to Paradise City so that could be interesting

797
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,800
although I gotta say like you really are gonna have to have either some type of joystick with

798
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,480
analog control or like a wheel for your PC to enjoy this game because I would think controlling

799
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,800
with the keyboard would just be ass well it's like I think back to like test drive and the

800
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,600
Commodore 64 and as cool as that game was trying to play it with a keyboard was stupid well just

801
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:58,040
remember that all the games for Windows stuff nowadays supports the Xbox 360 controller and

802
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:03,480
of course the racing we wait wait wait if you have an Xbox 360 controller why don't you have a 360 and

803
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,920
then you just buy you feel like a pro PC gaming but you're like I'm not that into PC gaming where

804
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:16,480
I need to use the control is the audience for that that big I played crisis with a 360 controller

805
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:25,080
me fine I'm not that into PC gaming so well the hooray for PC gamers because burnout paradise is

806
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:31,080
a solid game and I'm sure they'll be enjoying that yeah another game coming to PCs everywhere

807
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:37,320
everyday shooter is coming to steam and that was a pretty awesome game on PlayStation Network I

808
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,280
would know though because I hate having to put my credit card information on the PlayStation Network

809
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:51,040
so until those cards come out I won't buy it but it looks cool so that's 10 bucks and I think is

810
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:57,000
available now everybody shooters available on PlayStation Network now but not steam yet or is

811
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,520
it on steam now it might be on steam right now I'm actually I think it's available now hmm orange

812
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,400
on radio giving you definitive gaming news every week and we think it's out there it's out there

813
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,480
now all right I'm like I could log on just if I didn't think it would disrupt the all-game stream

814
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,600
I would log into stream or steam right now just to check you know I have to get that audio surf

815
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,480
game to on steam I keep hearing good things about that the only thing I bought on steam is portal

816
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:34,320
not anybody cares yeah so movie news more video games becoming movies one game that has been opted

817
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:42,240
apparently for a movie I guess what's going on is that Naughty Dog has made the game uncharted

818
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:49,960
Drake's Fortune and it's been optioned by Atlas Entertainment so that means that it is possible

819
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,920
that in the next few years uncharted Drake's Fortune could actually actually become a movie

820
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,200
now when I think about video games that I want to become movies this isn't really one that pops

821
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,760
right into my head but okay I think it could work though because it's not cut much of a stretch it's

822
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:12,520
just you know action adventure thing mm-hmm so uncharted the movie may be coming to a theater

823
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:20,840
near you in about two years we'll see we'll see well there's other movies in talk actually says

824
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:28,680
that it's already in development is a Bioshock movie to be put out by Universal with Gore

825
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:40,160
Verbinski as the director it seems so hey that's kind of cool you did your to the Caribbean and it

826
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:47,200
also looks like they've got John Logan as the screenplay writer well they've made a lot a lot

827
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,320
more with a lot less so you know the thing about Bioshock though is that when I play Bioshock it's

828
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,800
kind of like watching a movie you know what I mean like I don't know like we're getting to this point

829
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,400
where games are so realistic they don't have to be made into movies because they already kind of feel

830
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:07,360
like movies does that make sense nope sorry not hearing you but uh doesn't mean that they won't

831
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:14,120
make a movie out of it all right fine well it's just you know if there's money to be made they're

832
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:19,520
gonna make the money yeah right I hear ya but I don't know there's just there's other games that

833
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,640
I would want to see made into movies first like some of the other Final Fantasy games I don't know

834
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:29,560
but maybe that's just the family you know one good Final Fantasy movie and that was Advent Children

835
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:40,000
yeah yeah oh well well Grand Theft Auto 4 talking about it again of course its first week sold or

836
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:49,280
made half a billion dollars isn't bad I guess selling the 6 million copies and 3.6 million of

837
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:57,080
those the first day so that's pretty awesome and I'm sure well they're expecting I think to do

838
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:02,520
another you know a total of a billion dollars by the end this year so which is even bigger than a

839
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,600
movie yeah you know the only movie that made that much money in the u.s. league is that an

840
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,800
international figure or just a u.s. figure it's international okay well still I mean Titanic is

841
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,840
like one of a few only very very few movies is made a billion internationally you know what I

842
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:26,680
mean most of that is in I want to say in the u.s. because the UK I read only sold like about 900

843
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:33,320
just under a million units so only there's a lot of games oh well I mean just under a million when

844
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:38,320
you know about you know five millions coming from the u.s. I'd say that's a majority of you know the

845
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:45,360
sales there all right fine but still yeah it's gonna do very well I mean it's been what parodied

846
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,440
on a bunch of different things now if it's on Saturday Night Live and Conan so although it's

847
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,680
kind of lame I don't know it was a little stupid but yeah I mean it's definitely hitting the

848
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:00,840
mainstream so all right I got to back up in stories and talk about the Bioshock movie because

849
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,720
there's some comments from chat chat that orange launch radio.com act-deaf wants to know will the

850
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,320
main character save the Little Sisters or not Quill Tippo wants to know will Johnny Depp star

851
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:16,680
as a spinny slicer and Brahma says just because the fan base is massive that does not mean the

852
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:22,640
fans will buy it possibly talking about buying into a Bioshock movie I'd see it I actually see

853
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,360
it too just kind of out of curiosity I would be kind of curious how they'd approach that too

854
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,920
though because you know there's the whole Little Sister thing and you can do very good things are

855
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,640
very bad things depending on your moral compass I need we ethics to help me make the decision here

856
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:46,840
here hold on a second okay it says I should kill you we ethics as a yeah it's not your day magic

857
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:54,840
eight ball real of morality turn turn turn show me which person I should burn that's the best

858
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:04,680
ever Oh outcome not favorable yeah sorry fire all right APB is a game that is coming out from real

859
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:10,080
time worlds and real time worlds they are they just bought the distribution rights to the game

860
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:15,880
it's a big MMO coming out and basically they're making no shame about this they are saying they

861
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,000
want to try and get this to Rockstar as Grand Theft Auto online yeah originally real-time

862
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,140
worlds they actually developed a game and they had sold the rights to I remember who the hell they

863
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:31,360
sold it to well they sold it to somebody but they bought it back anybody back because you know APB

864
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:37,000
will real-time worlds to crack down you know awesome sandbox game and this one's kind of like

865
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:45,040
it's a grant or sandbox online game basically where we have half the people are cops half of

866
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:51,600
them you know our crooks and all sorts of chaos is going on so it's like a cross between cops and

867
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:57,640
robbers Saints Row Grand Theft Auto online so it's not bad so yeah it'd be pretty easy as long as

868
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,680
there are guns and rocket launchers I'm sold it's it looks pretty awesome that's the one they had

869
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,520
during the tech demo they had the it was like all the is during game developers conference they had

870
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:14,720
the custom characters and one of them was Shiggy oh yeah it was with the mark over the mushroom

871
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,240
boxers and oh yes very awesome character creator now we should say though right now this is in

872
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,880
rumor status it's not confirmed shares if it comes out as a PPL still played it's awesome

873
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:34,960
all right fanboy much yes hey I like my sandbox games what can I say well they like you too

874
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:43,040
all right well let's move on with our next story well what's the best part about Mortal

875
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:49,800
Kombat Rob um katana what does everybody else think the best thing about Mortal Kombat is

876
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:58,880
Rob uh friendships fatalities oh yes fatalities so of course as we know Midway said that Mortal

877
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:07,280
Kombat vs. DC was going to be a t-rated fighting game with you know no fatalities but what it is

878
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:16,920
is they're not going to be as outrageous as they were but they are modifying the fatalities they

879
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,360
are going to still be finishing moves in there remember the last time they modified fatalities

880
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:32,640
for the Super Nintendo release sweat yo yeah all I gotta say and honestly though I'm going to

881
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:39,120
reserve judgment but I only want that game to play as Batman so whatever amen but see it's it

882
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:48,120
is all about that one quote he says I'm the goddamn Batman it is sacrilegious though to

883
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,640
perform a fatality on Batman that's what I still don't get he can perform fatalities all he wants

884
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:58,360
although Batman I don't think really kills people like he does now well yeah I mean like in in the

885
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,680
movies usually when people die it's their own fault like Batman didn't like try to kill them

886
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:07,240
they just died you know what I mean depends on who's actually Batman at any given time in the

887
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:13,760
comics but see the Batman God in my world is Adam West from the 60s Batman and he never killed no

888
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,440
one so really Batman shouldn't be doing fatality I didn't kill him it was gravity that killed him

889
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:24,320
gravity and the sudden sudden stopping it was it was an accident he fell down an elevator shaft

890
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:36,960
on his bullets there you go yes anyways games like Mortal Kombat have been claimed before to turn

891
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:44,760
children into bloodthirsty killers but Harvard says otherwise because you know Harvard everybody

892
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:50,360
they're super smart right so we gotta listen to what they say or rich or rich hey well that's even

893
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:55,920
more reason listen to them a pair of Harvard researchers say violent video games don't turn

894
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,520
children into killers their parents do according to a newly published book Grand Theft Childhood

895
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:07,520
the surprising truth about video games what parents do psychologists Lawrence Kuttner and

896
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,680
Cheryl Olson this spell of course common myths about video games and apparently they found during

897
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,880
their two-year study that there was no data to support any connection between games and real-life

898
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,920
fire this is not the first time I've heard of this book it sounds pretty good no and says they

899
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:34,400
studied 1200 middle school children in a 1.5 million dollar or federally funded study and

900
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,440
says instead of studying children in the laboratory like other studies they actually sat down talk to

901
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:47,520
kids after long bouts of game playing sometimes in excess of 15 hours a week lucky kids I guess

902
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:53,280
we're playing a variety of games from nonviolent The Sims I don't know depends how you play The

903
01:02:53,280 --> 01:03:04,760
Sims my Sims sessions are pretty violent so to was it a Grand Theft Auto and they discovered

904
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:10,520
children who played violent video games those rated mature or above were just relieving stress

905
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:16,560
some children did exhibit playful fighting after playing games but it was similar to have what

906
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:23,600
children have done always after watching action or karate type movies 51% of the male children who

907
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:31,640
played for 15 hours or more a violent video games per week were involved in fights in the past year

908
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:40,920
compared to 28% Oh who yeah compared to 28% who regularly or played regular video games doesn't

909
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:48,520
make much hmm I guess who did not play video games anyways articles got the wrong text there

910
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:56,880
for girls 40% of the violent game players were in fights compared to I guess 14 of the nonviolent

911
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:03,240
players now so despite these figures I guess Kuttner and Olson say this is just a correlation

912
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:09,520
and that fighting was probably due to underlying psychological problem the children had before

913
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:16,400
playing video games I like how they just kind of just they're all you know even though the data

914
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:23,800
suggests that you know they may be prone to more violence just ignore that I'm very curious about

915
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,720
the book that's coming out though I actually might pick that up to read it it could be very

916
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,880
interesting I think it's already out no I know it just I think it just came out or it was like

917
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,040
about to come out like I think it was the thing I checked it out on amazon.com like about a month

918
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:42,160
ago and it was coming out like at the end of the month so I'm curious about it it's available now

919
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:47,120
well there you have it is that is it being widely distributed you think I could walk in any Barnes

920
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:55,000
and Noble and get it probably it says well right now on amazon.com you can get it for $16.50 all

921
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:01,840
right we are about to the end of this episode of orange launch radio part a anyway because there's

922
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:07,000
the whole part B that's coming up after a short break but we're doing something very kind of

923
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,200
unprecedented tonight during our live show we have I don't we haven't done this live ever since we

924
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:18,040
were still on life 365 and doing the three-hour show when there was no separate podcast and that

925
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:26,000
is tonight folks we are going to have a live cage match now here's the thing now live listeners

926
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,720
recognize this music because they know that after the show is done being taped for the night we like

927
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,920
to do some other silly segments at the end of the show and something we call the olr afterbirth and

928
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:43,000

941
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:59,040
finalists sure first I want to say we got a lot of great entries and I wish we could play them all

942
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:03,160
but we'd have to do like a whole separate podcast or something so we had to narrow it down to four

943
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,200
but the important thing is you all made us laugh our asses off and that's the important thing all

944
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,520
right so you ready to get to the four finalists here we go the first finalist by the way let me

945
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:19,040
let me recap for you guys what the contest rules were you know how in Grand Theft Auto 4 they have

946
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:23,920
to make or I mean in Grand Theft Auto 4 they have the radio station that plays when you're driving

947
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:31,560
around town well our entrance had to make a bumper that could possibly be heard on the radio in Grand

948
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:36,120
Theft Auto 4 but it had to incorporate Orange Lounge radio somehow like either one of our in

949
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:41,200
jokes or one of our hope you just had to do to have something to do with Orange Lounge radio all

950

959
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,600
was entry number one coming to us from act death let's go around and give our thoughts on that dark

960
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:26,380
Sakura a little derivative I think so it gets a seven all right um look I would have given that a very high

961
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:31,520
score but look you made way too much fun of me and those are clips that like are like five years

962
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:39,280
old and I am so pissed off that they've resurfaced not really but you know whatever I just they were

963
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:46,840
taken out of context I'll also give it a seven Loki I can't read that high because it mainly relied

964
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:52,920
on clips of the show and to work it wasn't really that original you know so I'm gonna give it like

965
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,160
a five all right but remember it is not our votes that matter our votes don't mean shit we're like

966
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,200
Paula Simon and Randy we don't pick up you do in chat so if you think we're totally wrong Paula

967
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:10,280
and vote for your favorite yeah cuz I'm the one on crack all right here she's totally on crack all

968
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:16,640
right here is entry number two finalist number two did not sign their entry so I'm just gonna

969
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:24,960
say it's Ian Ian M is finalist number two here is finalist number two tonight hello I'm Smith

970
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:32,840
Weston and I'm here to talk about a growing threat to America Iraqi suicide babies they may look small

971
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:45,320
and cute but don't let a situation like this happen to America oh my what a cute baby wait a second

972
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:59,800
baby why do you have seen four chapter ways my opponent won't protect you from Iraqi suicide

973
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:07,840
babies in fact he refuses to believe they exist so vote Smith Weston for mayor the right choice

974
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:20,240
for America God the audio levels of these are all so different sorry guys all right that was entry

975
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:26,520
number two Ian M with the the Iraqi suicide babies ad what you guys think dark Sakura it would have

976
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:34,560
been funny if you hadn't been sitting into the microphone I the idea was was funny but the

977
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:41,040
execution of said idea but they're not professionals we have to go a little easy on them but that's why

978
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:46,920
you go back and listen to it and when you realize you're speaking into the microphone then you go

979
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:53,440
back and move the microphone away from your mouth you know so it gets a seven all right yeah it was

980
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,840
a little popping but he's for me that you know and this is a problem we even have on the show

981
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,560
sometime because we don't have sufficient mic guards and it would really depends on the mic

982
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,320
you use so I'm being a little more lenient because you might just have a junky mic the idea was good

983
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,960
though I actually would have added like some music or something to make it a little more upbeat but

984
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,360
maybe I didn't know how so I can't punish you for that but I think I think it's gonna be tough

985
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:21,960
against these other finalists but I'll also give you a seven Loki better if you had a lot more like

986
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:28,080
internet clips of like babies cooing or like and like explosions more explosions more baby sounds

987
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,160
and that I think that would have been like pretty awesome but I'll give you like a seven because it

988
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:39,200
was you know definitely more original and clean clips all right here comes finalist number three

989
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:44,960
tonight finalist number three in the Grand Theft Auto 4 contest is able to think here's his entry

998
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,800
it we I think there was actually a Grand Theft Auto 4 reference in that one which is is pretty

999
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:53,880
good and it's very pimp like Grand Theft Auto is so I I give that a seven as well but again the

1000

1028
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:23,000
it was pretty good i love that it was just i mean seriously like he's a scholar of orange

1029
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,040
lounge radio in jokes it was one in joke after the other it just not like i love the part where dark

1030
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:34,200
sakura uh could not participate because or because it would be like what did he say he said it was

1031
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:40,200
because she was too she's too busy dying or no if if you hear it you will die in a fire it's no die

01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:45,400
in a boat fire wall something like underwater volcano like every reference back to back in an

1033
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:52,200
ocean abyss like just back to back but i don't know where in the hell you found that clip of me

1038
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:23,560

1039
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:30,680
lounge revolution two does not count towards the eye of judgment numbers and uh that would be a

1040

1052
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,600
classic game of the week we got to pay respect to our elders a little bit because without our

1053
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:05,400
elders in gaming there would be no grand theft out of four so uh dark sakura take it away and tell us

1054
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:12,760
your classic video game of the week my classic game of the week is one that i have brought up

1055
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:21,480
a number of times on the show which is one of the greatest shooting games of our is radiant

1056
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:31,480
silver gun radiant silver gun is uh developed by treasure i have played this in the arcade and i'm

1057
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:36,840
still trying to freaking find the saturn copy because i mean it's fucking radiant silver gun

1058
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:42,200
hello and the good thing about this game this is one of the things that i always always liked is

1059
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:50,920
that you had um your weapons were all available at the same time um your defense was all available

1060
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:57,480
your different power ups um you could um do a regular forward gun called the vulcan you had um

1061
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:05,480
homing missiles and you had a spread burst effect then you had like a lock-on spread you had one

1062
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:11,400
that would shoot one beam in the front and then a ton of beams in the back you had um a plasma

1063
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:19,000
weapon that sort of reminds me a little bit more um of the weapon the the uh electricity weapon from

1064
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:27,320
uh riding dx remember except it was very thin and it would be blocked by um whatever happened like a

1065
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:33,080
different uh items that were in the way um and then you had something called the radiant sword

1066
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:39,640
which was a sword that could shoot out from either side um there was also a few uh

1067
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:45,480
see you didn't actually have your power up you just level up your current weapons

1068
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:51,160
um one of my favorite ones in here is these uh these two balls that come out right in front of

1069
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:56,920
you but you shoot them out and they hover and then destroy whatever is in their way and um i also

1070
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:03,800
like this sword that comes out from behind and then comes out in a wide arc and claps together

1071
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:09,000
right right in front i think that's a very cool thing um it was very bullet heavy um

1072
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:17,000
and like the one level that um rob's playing um on uh on the beat right now is of the whole level

1073
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,440
where you're fighting just this big ship that it rotates around you and moves and you have to move

1074
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:32,440
with it and it was a very very challenging game um the saturn version um had a few different things

1075
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:41,080
as in it would um have you play through all of the stages um to unlock everything so

1076
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:48,200
it was like you were having to play it in chronological order too it was very bizarre

1077
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:52,920
to start off at three then two then four six then one so there's all kinds of kinds of weirdness

1078
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:59,960
with it but it's treasure so we expect weirdness from them um but you've also got um four major

1079
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:06,040
characters yeah four different characters to choose from um and each of them has their own

1080
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:13,400
little quirks and everything you've got you know the cape girl and everything so um the um arcade

1081
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:19,880
mode um would be played basically without the cutscenes or the dialogue but there was a saturn

1082
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:24,680
mode that did have a bit more story involved and that dialogue and stuff like there's one

1083
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:28,440
old stage that you play and this has got dialogue running all through the person's

1084
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:33,640
part of the stage and and it's that you know sort of old man voice saying and we did this back in

1085
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:39,480
the day and somebody shot somebody and there was a big war and a lot of people died so that's

1086
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:47,080
radius over here it's freaking awesome it's treasure all right it's like a shooter but with

1087
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:52,520
with uniqueness i don't know how else to explain it it's treasure i mean the only thing that you

1088
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:58,600
can say about a treasure game is that it's freaking treasure all of their games where

1089
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:04,200
they may seem like a straightforward genre you know that you've seen 50 million times they take

1090
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:10,280
something in it and innovate it they do something that turns it around and makes it completely

1091
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:16,920
different and that's you know and of course um they did um ikaruga which um contrary to popular

1092
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,960
belief is not a true sequel it's radiant silver again it's more of a spiritual story and it's

1093
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:28,440
spiritual sequels radiant silver gun but um i still honestly i think a radiant silver gun is

1094
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:34,280
superior to ikaruga but that's me and if treasure knows what's good for them we will be getting

1095
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:41,640
we will be getting more uh i guess uh re-releases of radiant silver gun

1096
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:49,720
and they'll give them directly to me and only you and gs68 points out something that i was going to

1097
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:57,000
mention is that radiant silver gun was inspired by image fight which was by um irm and that's the um

1098
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,760
the team that gave us well the company that gave us our type and also completely unrelated to

1099
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:06,760
radiant silver gun but since i mentioned our type i have to say this is that if you ordered

1100
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:11,800
that r-type strategy game you get um an r-type we covered that last week but that's all right

1101
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:16,680
i have one oh very cool you like it how big is it it's we couldn't figure that out on last week's

1102
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:21,240
show three inches long huh it's fairly decent size okay i'll bring it next week and put it

1103
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:26,360
on the cam so everyone can see all right but you know where i hate tactics games um i love

1104
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:30,840
our types dan cavett so it cancels each other out and you're ambivalent about the game i was like

1105
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:36,920
game i have i have the r-type thingy but no radiant silver yet it's treasure and i should

1106
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,960
do nothing to treasure games like for the next couple weeks but i don't know what you know we

1107
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:46,200
we got a game i was actually gonna originally do either you know i i've i'm gonna have to help you

1108
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:50,120

1109
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:55,080

1112
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:08,760
ever it is a very cool looking game you know i you want no secret i've never played this game

1113
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,360
i played it the only time i've actually played this game is in an arcade you know whenever we

1114
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:16,520
actually get our little uh justin tv idea off the ground that we need to do that because i need to

1115

1116
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:28,680
