1
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:16,964
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

2
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:33,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy Holidays, y'all!

3
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:36,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:42,902
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:45,343
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:48,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Santa, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:49,406
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

8
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:51,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura, of course.

9
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:51,968
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

10
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:53,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

11
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:56,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing, um, crampy.

12
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:57,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Ho, ho, ho.

13
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Bah, fucking humbug.

14
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:03,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Try having cramps around Christmas, you'll curse your uterus.

15
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:06,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Santa bring you cramps for Christmas?

16
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:07,449
[SPEAKER_02]: That and a migraine.

17
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:08,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you were a bad girl.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck I was.

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather have coal because then I could light it on fire and be warm.

20
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

21
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:18,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

22
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:20,696
[SPEAKER_04]: One of Santa's elves joining us from North Pole.

23
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:21,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

24
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:23,917
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

25
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:25,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Highly accurate.

26
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:26,718
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you this week?

27
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:27,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing fine.

28
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything exciting planned for the holidays?

29
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:29,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

30
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:31,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

31
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:33,639
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,661
[SPEAKER_04]: You tell us about it?

33
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I will in just a minute.

34
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, okay, then.

35
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:43,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you should already know what it is, but there's lots of stuff leading up to that.

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sometimes I play stupid for the sake of the listeners.

37
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:46,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

38
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:49,196
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets you to retell the story, even though you might have already told me.

39
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I don't know when you're pretending.

40
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:51,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Radio magic.

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:52,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Radio magic.

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,782
[SPEAKER_02]: There's commentary in the chat room, Rob, about you saying y'all.

43
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

44
00:01:58,044 --> 00:01:59,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they not like the y'all?

45
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:00,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I not allowed to say that?

46
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:00,506
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say it right.

47
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:01,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm from NorCal?

48
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,168
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say it right.

49
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:03,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what was I supposed to say?

50
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:04,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all.

51
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:04,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all.

52
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, depending on certain parts, you-ins.

53
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:09,895
[SPEAKER_04]: You-ins?

54
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:10,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

55
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:11,296
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

56
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And J-Rod in chat wants to point out, my girlfriend also has cramps.

57
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Coincidence or evil plot?

58
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:17,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Coincidence.

59
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:22,426
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to make your Christmas suffer a little bit.

60
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:23,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Could it be a conspiracy?

61
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:27,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Are all the gamer chicks on one big cycle?

62
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:30,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Only unless we've all been hanging out in the same room for at least two months.

63
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know, Rob?

64
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your unwanted education.

65
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:36,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh lordy.

66
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:41,176
[SPEAKER_02]: That if you get women living in the same place for long enough, their cycles will align.

67
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:41,857
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've heard it.

68
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:42,397
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've heard it.

69
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:43,438
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was making the joke.

70
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:49,443
[SPEAKER_04]: That all the gaming girls, you know, like somehow via Xbox Live, I don't know, have all gotten on the same cycle.

71
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, that must suck in college.

72
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:56,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, because... It's like, everybody hide!

73
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:59,852
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the two... No, it was actually true for my dorm.

74
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:01,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I can bet.

75
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:02,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I had a suite.

76
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:04,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So me, my roommate, and our suite mate...

77
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:09,250
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all like, chocolate, wine, now!

78
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:15,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we were poor, so it was, you know, Strawberry Hill or Apple Wine.

79
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:17,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Mad Dog?

80
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:19,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,483
[SPEAKER_02]: We at least had the taste to get the tasty Boone's Farm stuff.

82
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:23,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

83
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:24,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And Everclear.

84
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was Alabama, and you could get Everclear.

85
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:28,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

86
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:33,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, look, we're going to get into how was your gaming week as we always start off the show.

87
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Not how was your vagina, but how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

88
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,962
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

89
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:40,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Vagina Wars.

90
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:40,623
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

91
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:40,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

92
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:50,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually turned on my DS and then turned it right off when I got a phone call and forgot to play again.

93
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:54,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some Ragnarok, because I'm still playing!

94
00:03:55,651 --> 00:04:01,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've decided that I might actually go back to World of Warcraft for just a little bit, just to see what the new expansion's like.

95
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,618
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really don't think I'll stick with it.

96
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:07,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a, eh, why not, while I'm waiting for the Star Trek MMO.

97
00:04:08,342 --> 00:04:13,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to warn you, if you're not at least level 55 in World of Warcraft, you won't see anything in the new expansion.

98
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:15,486
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all endgame content and a new class.

99
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:16,047
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

100
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:18,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sadly, there won't be a lot there for you.

101
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:19,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play a Draenei.

102
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Draeneis are fun.

103
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:26,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And name her... I don't know.

104
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:27,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a name I was going to name her.

105
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:32,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Draenei women talk like Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle.

106
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:35,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Boris Luke is moose in school.

107
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:36,979
[SPEAKER_02]: He's fearless leader, darling.

108
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:40,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would suit.

109
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:44,709
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

110
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:50,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to, in the next week, download Cho Inaki.

111
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:52,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know what else it was!

112
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:56,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually sat and watched a playthrough of Abadox.

113
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:58,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And how was that?

114
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:00,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as shitty as I remember.

115
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:03,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

116
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:04,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I played more Grand Theft Auto on PC

117
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:37,043
[SPEAKER_05]: and I've actually started tweaking some stuff now because they've made it a little bit easier for you to actually edit stuff in the game.

118
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:38,504
[SPEAKER_05]: You just kind of have to know what you're doing.

119
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:43,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit like the cheat device was on the Grand Theft Auto on PSP.

120
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:44,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar type of stuff.

121
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,490
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a file that you edit some of the amounts with.

122
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's a lot easier on the PC version because everything is labeled for you.

123
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:57,316
[SPEAKER_05]: So I made a pistol that would catch a cop car and fire in one shot and that was funny.

124
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:00,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but just, um, some of that stuff.

125
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:04,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the game crashed because I shot too many cars and caught them on fire.

126
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently I didn't like that much fire at one time.

127
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:14,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it's kind of like finding a balance, you know, between, um, crazy shit and, uh... Between fuego and non...

128
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:28,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, see, my next thing I want to do is, because you can make your gunfire have so much kickback to it, like if you shoot somebody, it'll knock them over, or you can make them, like, fly away and that type of stuff.

129
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:37,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to do that, but I also want to have the trainer where I have infinite health, so I can basically, you know, catapult myself with rockets, you know, across the map.

130
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:38,629
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be fun.

131
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:42,111
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, eventually I'll do that.

132
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:44,333
[SPEAKER_05]: But there aren't that many mods out there for it right now.

133
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:50,177
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a drifting mod, a mod that changes the car names to, I guess, realistic cars.

134
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:55,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, the rocket pistol thing, which I was trying to do that myself.

135
00:06:55,401 --> 00:07:00,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first time it glitched out where I actually couldn't select that pistol anymore.

136
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:01,726
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I figured out what I was doing wrong.

137
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:02,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.

138
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not quite to where I need it to be yet.

139
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,151
[SPEAKER_05]: But soon it will be.

140
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:24,792
[SPEAKER_05]: and then of course more Grand Theft Auto 4 multiplayer at work and that's still fun and other than Grand Theft Auto I've been playing Dissida the new Final Fantasy fighting game and it's

141
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,934
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

142
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,776
[SPEAKER_05]: in a gentle way that you appreciate it.

143
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:55,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gentle rape.

144
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:58,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, oh my god, this is awesome.

145
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:00,598
[SPEAKER_02]: That can't be rape if you're willing.

146
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So just say that maybe it's a bit of sadism.

147
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

148
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,122
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be like a hot chick all of a sudden getting naked and thrusting herself upon you.

149
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:17,043
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, at first you're kind of like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here?

150
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:17,843
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you just go with it.

151
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:19,224
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

152
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:22,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't know, I haven't had that happen

153
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:40,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it on the PS3 or something like that, and then also expand upon it, because Dissida is basically fighting, that's all it is.

154
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:45,319
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a little bit of cutscenes and stuff like that, but there's no actual roleplaying and running around and that kind of stuff.

155
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:57,103
[SPEAKER_05]: But they kept the fighting system in here, and say they did a Kingdom Hearts type of thing where you have all the different characters from the different games, they could really have a kickass game on their hands, but Dissida itself is going to be really awesome.

156
00:08:57,842 --> 00:09:05,471
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Dark Knight in chat at chat.orange.com jokes Dissida, aka Urgeis2 No, it's not even close to Urgeis.

157
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:06,633
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.

158
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even remotely close.

159
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:11,983
[SPEAKER_04]: A.A.A.A.

160
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:39,374
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he has no name.

161
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:40,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the Warrior of Light.

162
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Poop, if it's my cartridge.

163
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,977
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not Poop.

164
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:51,122
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's cool, though, because as you level up the characters, they level up in all the other levels that they appear in as well.

165
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I did have a party in Final Fantasy because I'm this mature.

166
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was Ass, Assy, Butt, and Poop.

167
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:14,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last time when we played it on, because I have the WonderSwan one in Japanese, I actually sat down and tried to figure out the names to put in it in Katakana, so we had Dan, Jamie.

168
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:19,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan made Eric for some reason, one of his buddies who's kind of not all that bright.

169
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't remember who we named the last one.

170
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:28,665
[SPEAKER_02]: My Chrono Trigger cartridge actually still has my friend's save on it that has me and there's Luca.

171
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:36,609
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously though, like, you know, not to interrupt or anything, this game could be like Kingdom Hearts, but without...

172
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:38,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's in Japanese, so I can't read that.

173
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:39,897
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe he did in Japanese.

174
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:40,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

175
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:08,731
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty then.

176
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:11,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you've been playing this week?

177
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal Crossing.

178
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:15,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Played a little more Animal Crossing.

179
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:17,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I'm still playing Animal Crossing.

180
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:18,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to come visit Nelly's Village.

181
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:19,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

182
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:24,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing is, I tried... You know, I don't understand this.

183
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:28,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently you have to talk to some idiot in the town to get a friend code.

184
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:30,293
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck?

185
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:31,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to talk to the guy at the gate.

186
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:33,734
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you've done it in all the last versions, too.

187
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:38,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's great, but why the hell do I have to talk to somebody who has a friend code assigned to the game?

188
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:38,836
[SPEAKER_05]: That's stupid.

189
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:42,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that way it connects to Nintendo Wi-Fi.

190
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:44,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It also is different per player.

191
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:50,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so once you get it from Nintendo Wi-Fi, then you can access it whenever in the game.

192
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just have to do it that one time.

193
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to do that, but I haven't gone around to that yet.

194
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:56,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I will, though.

195
00:11:56,822 --> 00:11:57,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

196
00:11:57,898 --> 00:11:58,378
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

197
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Unpsychopedia is so strange.

198
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:28,903
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a picture of one of the little aliens bursting out of someone's stomach.

199
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:32,764
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this picture taken by hospital staff one minute after Lavos was born.

200
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Cute little scamp, wasn't he?

201
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:37,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody in chat made a Lavos joke.

202
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:39,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about, oh, Dan Shadow says, you think that's fun?

203
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:41,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Try playing Chrono Trigger and name everyone Lavos.

204
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that's supposed to do.

205
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the only new game I played this week was the free game.

206
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:53,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I love free games, and there was a free game that hit Xbox Live this week.

207
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you all remember, but it's Doritos Dash of Destruction.

208
00:12:56,936 --> 00:13:01,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's an XNA game that somebody made, or it was a concept for a game.

209
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It won some type of contest.

210
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:04,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was an XNA contest.

211
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Doritos made people try to come up with a concept for a game, and then they made a Doritos game.

212
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:10,023
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

213
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:34,902
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be anything.

214
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:38,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can play a T-Rex and chase said trucks.

215
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:41,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of an interesting little cat and mouse concept.

216
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:44,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got to say, it's better than Yaris as far as free games go.

217
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something I would have paid money for?

218
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

219
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:50,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe $5.

220
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:51,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

221
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:59,658
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's that cute little cat and mouse thing going on where you can play the truck, try and do the deliveries, or you can go in and out and try to eat the trucks.

222
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:01,699
[SPEAKER_04]: And that made it kind of fun.

223
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,582
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think it's anything that's going to have a lasting value to it.

224
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:07,243
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the levels kind of look the same.

225
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:11,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus you just would unexplainably get these power-ups that didn't seem to do a whole lot of anything.

226
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:15,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game was handing out achievements like candy.

227
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really one of those games where it was like, push start.

228
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

229
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:37,064
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

230
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Texas Hold'em was free for a little while.

231
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,339
[SPEAKER_01]: You're marbles!

232
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, besides that.

233
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, what on the Xbox 360 did I lose?

234
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:28,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it wasn't any of the rock band tracks.

235
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not gonna notice they're gone.

236
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if it was, like, hopefully it was one of, like, the crappy ones.

237
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:35,086
[SPEAKER_04]: We can always re-download them.

238
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:35,926
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

239
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:37,927
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the original rock band songs, though?

240
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:41,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you'd have to re-download them unless you, um, sold them.

241
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,072
[SPEAKER_05]: If you sold it back, then you're kind of screwed there.

242
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:46,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually never did sell Rock Band back.

243
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:49,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I still know people who still have Rock Band if you need it.

244
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:49,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't checked.

245
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't checked to see what got corrupted.

246
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:54,138
[SPEAKER_04]: But I haven't played Rock Band since the transfer.

247
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:58,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was probably the largest chunk of my old hard drive was Rock Band songs.

248
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have a lot of Rock Band songs.

249
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have the Rock Band 1 exported, the entire No Doubt album, and just like at least 20 download songs on top of that.

250
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:08,388
[SPEAKER_04]: So pretty crazy.

251
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:09,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I finally bought a...

252
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:17,613
[SPEAKER_05]: A hard drive transfer thing that's not part of Microsoft's transfer kit.

253
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:20,594
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually something to dump files to your hard drive and that kind of stuff.

254
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:36,198
[SPEAKER_05]: To get, well, on top of potential modding things, to basically move the two PopCap games saves that PopCap for some reason said, No, you can't transfer to a memory unit.

255
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:37,979
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be dicks about that.

256
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:42,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah, I love how on Twitter they're like, oh yeah, we're looking into that.

257
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,612
[SPEAKER_05]: He thinks we're looking into that.

258
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:48,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw you got a response, though, that was basically they couldn't figure it out.

259
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,631
[SPEAKER_05]: No, their response was like, you have to re-download the game.

260
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:54,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, what the fuck does that have to do with my save file, stupid?

261
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Not, like, transferring the game.

262
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the save file.

263
00:16:58,876 --> 00:16:59,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait a minute, though.

264
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:01,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I theorized a couple weeks ago when this first came out.

265
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:03,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this is something that was kind of out of their control.

266
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, they just... It's not out of their control.

267
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:15,568
[SPEAKER_05]: All the other games before and after them have allowed me to move the save files to a memory unit and, you know, move it to another hard drive.

268
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:19,251
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not be able to copy them to other profiles.

269
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:20,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that.

270
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,272
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes perfect sense.

271
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:24,134
[SPEAKER_05]: But not being able to move it at all, that's retarded.

272
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:25,595
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what else did that?

273
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:28,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Hexic HD won't let you move this thing.

274
00:17:28,657 --> 00:17:32,359
[SPEAKER_05]: So, screw you, Microsoft, and screw you, PopCap.

275
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,320
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, though.

276
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do it anyways.

277
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I will find a way.

278
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:39,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have people from PopCap that listen, so I hope... Well, then fine!

279
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Screw you both!

280
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:42,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Bejeweled 2 and Zuma...

281
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:47,309
[SPEAKER_05]: for whatever reason, your stupid save files won't move.

282
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:56,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the game, the game is fine, because I can delete it, download it, move it, whatever I need to do, but the save files will not move.

283
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:59,819
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm assuming this is a big crisis in your house, because Zuma is like one of the only games your wife will play.

284
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,522
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not a big crisis, but it's annoying, because if my wife... It's the principle of the thing.

285
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:09,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we put in a lot of time to Bejeweled 2, which I might add, the achievements are...

286
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn near impossible to get.

287
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:14,991
[SPEAKER_05]: But for whatever reason, we put a lot of time into it.

288
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:16,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially Zuma.

289
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:17,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Zuma gets pretty hard too.

290
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,614
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that I can get some achievements in.

291
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:21,436
[SPEAKER_05]: But Jewel 2 is a bitch.

292
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:25,879
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I don't want to lose all my progress in that.

293
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:26,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game.

294
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if it's a crappy game.

295
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,682
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still progress and I don't want to lose it.

296
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:32,844
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the fact that

297
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,541
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

298
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:42,048
[SPEAKER_05]: S.S.J.

299
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:46,369
[SPEAKER_05]: 100 Matt wants to point out now if Nelly lost her Excite Truck save file then shit would hit the fan.

300
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but it might give her another reason to play it again.

301
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:13,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to say, though, since Matt brought up PopCap, I did play the new Bejeweled thing on Facebook.

302
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:18,473
[SPEAKER_04]: They have like a Bejeweled tournament thing on Facebook where you get like a minute to get as many points as you can.

303
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:23,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, I'm on the top of the leaderboard, at least of my friends list, because you can't see everybody.

304
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,276
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see your friends list.

305
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I got 55,000 in one minute.

306
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I got really lucky with the chains.

307
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:29,258
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I can say.

308
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,599
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought that was kind of cute that they put that on Facebook.

309
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so anything else for Gaming Weeks around?

310
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:36,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody?

311
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:38,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I played rock band.

312
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:39,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first one.

313
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:40,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

314
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:41,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what Julie got.

315
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:45,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to say I've forgotten how much I hate the rock band guitars.

316
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,746
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I remember because it was forced upon me.

317
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:49,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate them.

318
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:50,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

319
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:52,488
[SPEAKER_02]: They're flimsy.

320
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:57,450
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be better for strumming, but most of the time the keys stick on both of them.

321
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wouldn't sync properly for the wireless one.

322
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:02,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a pain in the ass.

323
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:06,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And next time I go over there, I'm bringing my Guitar Hero controllers.

324
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:08,614
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.

325
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:09,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I did watch a lot of Netflix stuff.

326
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:10,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

327
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:12,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't the Netflix thing on 360 great?

328
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched a documentary this week because now Netflix... On penguins?

329
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:16,884
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

330
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:21,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Netflix got smart and they added an HD category on their Watch Instantly thing.

331
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:22,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was looking at HD movies.

332
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:26,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And I watched a documentary because I've been all about the obscure documentaries on Netflix.

333
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:27,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

334
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,097
[SPEAKER_04]: But I watched an obscure documentary about...

335
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:33,460
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that dress up as superheroes on Hollywood Boulevard and post for pictures.

336
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:36,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's called Confessions of a Superhero was the name of the movie.

337
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was interesting.

338
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting seeing the reasons why people did it.

339
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Some did it because they were obsessed with their character.

340
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people did it just for another job.

341
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:48,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people did it because they have issues.

342
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,151
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of issues.

343
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I want to come over and watch documentaries with you now that I don't have school.

344
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:52,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

345
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:54,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I have work.

346
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:54,955
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sad thing.

347
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:55,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I have work.

348
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:57,136
[SPEAKER_04]: But not every day.

349
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:57,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I have work.

350
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:58,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

351
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to come watch documentaries with you.

352
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:01,807
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

353
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:02,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's fun.

354
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:03,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, documentary night.

355
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:06,511
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try to see who can find the most obscure documentary.

356
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there are some obscure documentaries on Netflix.

357
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:12,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of documentaries, I got a screener copy of E!

358
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:19,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Athletes, which if I remember correctly, I think that's the film that Scott Rubin actually did some of the shooting for.

359
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,102
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about those two Counter-Strike teams.

360
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:26,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And they came to Eldorado Hills to do part of the tournament there.

361
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:29,728
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was filming a second unit or whatever on that.

362
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:30,969
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of neat.

363
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw Confessions of a Superhero

364
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:50,558
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

365
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:17,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that sounds cruel, but I just didn't see... Her costume was decent, but I just didn't see... She did not look like Wonder Woman as much as Batman looked like Batman or Superman looked like Superman.

366
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:20,532
[SPEAKER_02]: There was only one Wonder Woman ever.

367
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was in the 70s.

368
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:27,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was freaking fantastic, and I really enjoyed seeing her in Sky High.

369
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:31,436
[SPEAKER_04]: You were going to say something, Loki?

370
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:31,636
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

371
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:38,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I've actually seen part of that show or something that had to do with those people that were on Hollywood Boulevard.

372
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:39,399
[SPEAKER_04]: You might.

373
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,820
[SPEAKER_04]: A hostile one in chat says, I've seen that doc.

374
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,441
[SPEAKER_04]: They even said that people were protective.

375
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm the only one who can play Superman on this block.

376
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:47,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

377
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:48,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

378
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Elmo wants some money for drugs!

379
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:51,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Give Elmo money!

380
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:19,184
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

381
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:44,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, the man who does the show before us, is doing his annual year-end special next week, and he's going to have some guests on his show and all that fun stuff.

382
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:49,572
[SPEAKER_04]: He might be starting a little early, and we might let him run a little late to help out.

383
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:49,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We are?

384
00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:50,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe.

385
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:50,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Vito!

386
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:51,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little.

387
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:52,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little.

388
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:52,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Kidding.

389
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:53,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

390
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:57,398
[SPEAKER_04]: But that means, it made me realize, that means next week is our year-end show.

391
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:00,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't even thinking about it, but yeah, next week's the year-end show.

392
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:01,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you believe it?

393
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:04,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because it comes the same time every year.

394
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:05,184
Yeah.

395
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:12,058
[SPEAKER_04]: And there will be no show on the week of January 11th.

396
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:13,399
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no show.

397
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:14,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be in Hawaii.

398
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not be here the weekend of the 31st.

399
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:17,141
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

400
00:24:17,702 --> 00:24:18,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm going to Disneyland.

401
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:21,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Presents.

402
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:22,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

403
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:23,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do our gift exchange.

404
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I may go.

405
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:24,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

406
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:26,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel bad, though, because I didn't get gifts today.

407
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:27,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

408
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:27,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait.

409
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:28,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go anywhere.

410
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:33,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I am doing something different and experimental this year for Christmas.

411
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:33,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

412
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I already gave you part of yours already.

413
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I was going to say, I thought Prince of Persia was my gift.

414
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, not Prince of Persia, Animal Crossing.

415
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:42,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Prince of Persia, that was a freebie.

416
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:42,993
[SPEAKER_04]: That too.

417
00:24:44,855 --> 00:24:46,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you've already got me a gift, Loki.

418
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:47,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but this is cool, though.

419
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:49,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw this at the store and I had to get it for you.

420
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:50,300
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, yay, gifts.

421
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry we don't have a camera tonight.

422
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:52,862
[SPEAKER_04]: This sucks for TV.

423
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:53,823
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

424
00:24:55,564 --> 00:24:56,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

425
00:24:57,986 --> 00:25:01,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, HitStun, we will not cut off the Bobby Blackwolf show.

426
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:02,530
[SPEAKER_04]: If they go a little long, we'll deal.

427
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:03,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Trek Pez Dispensers

428
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:23,723
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

429
00:25:46,747 --> 00:26:01,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to, actually, I was, because the artwork is a different style, and so I wasn't looking at the character designs, I was reading Ragu no Raku on I was like, oh shit, because I read like an illiterate, you know, child.

430
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:02,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

431
00:26:02,874 --> 00:26:03,334
[SPEAKER_02]: In Japanese.

432
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave Rob sparklies.

433
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:07,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, oh, I'm opening it right now.

434
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:09,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's glitter and glitter and more glitter.

435
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:15,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, this looks awesome.

436
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:16,179
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

437
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it's like, oh, I've seen this in the store before.

438
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:23,286
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Press Your Luck DVD game.

439
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:24,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Play at home edition.

440
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:25,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

441
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:30,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I was going to get you the prices right, but I didn't think you liked Drew Carey so much.

442
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:31,209
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all right.

443
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:35,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it didn't have Bob Barker or, you know, dude.

444
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, but Press Your Luck is epic.

445
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:37,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's old school.

446
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:38,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.

447
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:38,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I made sure.

448
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:39,792
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

449
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:43,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it does have the new host, but seeing as the other one died.

450
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:44,553
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's got the old whammy.

451
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:45,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it has the old whammy.

452
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:46,694
[SPEAKER_04]: That is amazing.

453
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:48,261
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

454
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:49,781
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play a DVD game or something?

455
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:50,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

456
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:50,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to check that out?

457
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:51,122
[SPEAKER_04]: The box?

458
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:53,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

459
00:26:53,302 --> 00:26:56,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, I got, I got, um, well, Matt, tell your president.

460
00:26:57,363 --> 00:26:57,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

461
00:26:58,063 --> 00:26:58,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't think of what to get you.

462
00:26:58,863 --> 00:26:59,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read the card, too.

463
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tried to get you something useful.

464
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:01,324
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

465
00:27:01,744 --> 00:27:02,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

466
00:27:02,884 --> 00:27:03,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

467
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:05,224
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool there, Rob.

468
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:07,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I don't know what that book is.

469
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:12,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to open it, you know, so I don't know if that's a manual or like an art book or something that they threw in there.

470
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to open it right now.

471
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:17,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but I figured, you know, Ragnarok

472
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,166
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Dark Knight brought up something about the Price is Right that reminded me.

473
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:27,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the, in chat room, did you see the talk about the guy on the Price is Right that nailed the showcase on the head?

474
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:28,589
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the manual.

475
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

476
00:27:30,591 --> 00:27:34,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I was joking about how I think that's a giant conspiracy.

477
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:37,495
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more in my life journal.

478
00:27:38,335 --> 00:27:40,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitstun says, does Ragnarok DS have any sort of online play?

479
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:43,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a few players, like local.

480
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:48,064
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fantastic!

481
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:55,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you do your attacks and spellcasting by stylus control.

482
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:01,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

483
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:05,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what a happy holiday we have here on Orange Lounge Radio this week.

484
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:09,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for me, I'm a Grinch, because I didn't give out presents tonight.

485
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,320
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright, don't worry about it.

486
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm doing something different this year.

487
00:28:13,102 --> 00:28:13,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice!

488
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the skill trees in here.

489
00:28:16,215 --> 00:28:21,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't want to forget these all in my house and I started to get to the point now where I'm like, whose gift is that?

490
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:22,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Whose gift is that?

491
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:24,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh crap, I gotta get rid of these.

492
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:25,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

493
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:27,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, woo!

494
00:28:28,698 --> 00:28:30,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we've all been bitten by Christmas spirit.

495
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,180
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two classes that are just for the DS.

496
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,141
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna hear little tidbits about Ragnarok DS all night long.

497
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:40,342
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Dark Knight.

498
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:45,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in fact, DJ Dark Knight in chat says Jamie wishes she could bring her online character to the DS game.

499
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:52,778
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, my characters are like over 120 something right now, so, because I'm playing on a private server.

500
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, plus you play on bootleg servers, so I don't think that would be a coach.

501
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Dark Knight's fucking hot.

502
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:02,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I like J-Rod, Star Trek, Pez, Spencer, what a thoughtful way to carry around your ecstasy.

503
00:29:04,346 --> 00:29:05,047
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

504
00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:07,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Trek Pest Dispensers

505
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:28,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, dude, I gotta pick this up for Rob.

506
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:29,456
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

507
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:38,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I thought about getting you another Imagine game this year for the DS, but I figured I'd actually give you something useful instead of, you know... I'm putting pictures up in a second.

508
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:39,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

509
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so, wait, is that going on your Twitter?

510
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:42,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

511
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:49,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll link the picture in the chat room because my Twitter's blocked from almost everybody, so... Oh, you can log into the OLR one if you want.

512
00:29:49,264 --> 00:29:49,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

513
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:52,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on and get into some gaming news.

514
00:29:53,666 --> 00:30:01,189
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go from such happy, joyous, wonderful news to not-so-great news tonight.

515
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:08,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to listen to the first stories in tonight's show and see if they all have something in common because it's kind of sad, actually.

516
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:12,693
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a bummer we have to follow up such positive stuff with this.

517
00:30:13,873 --> 00:30:16,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Factor 5 has closed its doors.

518
00:30:16,574 --> 00:30:19,515
[SPEAKER_05]: The developer known for such games as Lair...

519
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:25,226
[SPEAKER_05]: and some better games as Star Wars Rogue Squadron and even like the Turrican series.

520
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:32,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently they were being rumored to be working on the new Kid Icarus and Superman games.

521
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:34,869
[SPEAKER_05]: But they have closed their... Superman 128?

522
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:36,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Curse of Spider-Man.

523
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, it's Superman, I tell you.

524
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:42,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a new Superman, not tying in with the movie.

525
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:54,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have closed their doors, and it was supposedly confirmed by Matt Casamani from IGN, who had, I believe, received an email from...

526
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:58,038
[SPEAKER_05]: and Julian at Factor 5.

527
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:59,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, Hi Matt, how have you been?

528
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Wanted to contact you with some late-breaking news.

529
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:09,306
[SPEAKER_05]: We just learned Inside Sources that developer Factor 5 has officially closed the doors as of today.

530
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:13,249
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some pretty big news considering that those guys have been around for quite a while.

531
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:17,572
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a real shame and I hope this information is helpful to you.

532
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you know who we have to blame for this?

533
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:20,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Lair?

534
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:22,776
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Ronald Reagan.

535
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:23,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

536
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:24,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Reaganomics.

537
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:31,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, that's one of the big contributors to our financial crisis right now.

538
00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:36,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, perhaps it continues on in these other stories we're getting into, such as about Electronic Arts.

539
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Electronic Arts had to cut 1,000 jobs and closed

540
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:47,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Box Studio in Vancouver is going to be merged with the EA Studio in nearby Burnaby.

541
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:21,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, so this is going to save the company $120 million annually, but costing them about $60 million in restructuring charges while this goes on.

542
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:24,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a bummer for those folks that got laid off.

543
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:25,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to hear about it.

544
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:27,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some friends that worked at EA.

545
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:27,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

546
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:34,532
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not people I talk to every day, so I don't know if anybody I know is affected by this, but still, my thoughts are with you guys.

547
00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:35,932
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very unfortunate.

548
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:40,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there actually is going for Midway too.

549
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:50,965
[SPEAKER_02]: The rumor was that they were going to be laying off around 160 people from the Chicago studio for the most part because of financial issues.

550
00:32:52,285 --> 00:32:56,926
[SPEAKER_02]: The official word is that they're laying 25% off of its workforce.

551
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:58,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's about 180 people.

552
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:03,570
[SPEAKER_02]: 130 people from Chicago and 45 from Austin.

553
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:06,752
[SPEAKER_02]: The Austin operation itself has closed.

554
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:14,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's supposed to be some other games that were unannounced that are being suspended.

555
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just trying to, I guess, mitigate whatever the costs are.

556
00:33:19,903 --> 00:33:21,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the Mortal Kombat team is safe.

557
00:33:21,824 --> 00:33:26,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We can all sleep easy, I think.

558
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:27,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

559
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:28,969
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just crap.

560
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:36,964
[SPEAKER_05]: and even more upsetting for me, Free Radical has closed shop.

561
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:47,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently their doors were locked and all the employees were locked out while the company was having some final meetings deciding what the fate of the company was going to be.

562
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Free Radical is known for the

563
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:51,859
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

564
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:12,150
[SPEAKER_05]: The good news is, though, is they may not be out of work for long.

565
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:23,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, some other companies are looking to purchase Free Radical and kind of absorb them into their, you know, developing firms.

566
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:26,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of good because I want to see TimeSplitters 4.

567
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:30,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of neat since they were, you know,

568
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:32,196
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

569
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

570
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

571
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:14,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the new studio had been formed a few months before this whole, I guess, thing happened.

572
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:18,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was working out before everything.

573
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:23,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he kind of figured that this was going to happen anyways and so kind of a precautionary measure.

574
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:28,799
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm wondering if this guy didn't kind of see the writing on the wall.

575
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:40,712
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru in chat says this is what happens when you don't support the console that won that's the Wii my friends wait a minute look at EA they just laid off a bunch of people they've been big supporters of the Wii right?

576
00:35:40,732 --> 00:35:41,392
[SPEAKER_04]: even sort of yeah

577
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:59,099
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru says the economic crisis just accelerated the problem.

578
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really say Free Radical wasn't supporting the Wii.

579
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,062
[SPEAKER_05]: They've only made one game since the new consoles have come out, you know, Haze.

580
00:36:07,763 --> 00:36:10,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not really fair.

581
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:18,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, another company seems to be cutting back on staff.

582
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:20,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Asper is the name of the company and they are based out of Austin.

583
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:23,374
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably most known for some of their porting work.

584
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,036
[SPEAKER_04]: They ported Call of Duty 4 and Sims 2 to the PC and the Mac respectively.

585
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

586
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:47,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, so no comments out of Asper.

587
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:51,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I should note, though, that that story was just a rumor status only.

588
00:36:52,507 --> 00:36:57,352
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it unfortunately would not be surprising considering all the other news we're hearing this week.

589
00:36:58,635 --> 00:36:58,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

590
00:36:58,895 --> 00:37:00,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

591
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in other words, they're like, oh, fuck, bye.

592
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.

593
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:31,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.

594
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan got laid off in the money store.

595
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:02,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

596
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what happens?

597
00:38:03,862 --> 00:38:04,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar?

598
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:09,064
[SPEAKER_02]: They just went in, found a bunch of people walking out with stuff, and so they're like, just pack your desks and go.

599
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:10,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

600
00:38:10,485 --> 00:38:11,865
[SPEAKER_04]: My gosh.

601
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:13,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they bribed us to stay.

602
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:16,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my question.

603
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:17,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this going to continue?

604
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:19,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this was six in a week.

605
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:22,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to see more throughout the next few weeks, or what's going to happen?

606
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Blame Reagan, blame Bush.

607
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:28,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's next?

608
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:31,218
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Republicans.

609
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:32,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait a minute, though.

610
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:33,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not get too political here.

611
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:52,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, seriously, if you look at it historically, the reason why we're in all this financial shit is because of Reagan's whole Reaganomics crap and the fact that people have decided just to screw us over instead of putting money back into the economy where it goes.

612
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:55,596
[SPEAKER_02]: We're spending money on a war we didn't need to spend money on.

613
00:38:57,037 --> 00:39:24,962
[SPEAKER_02]: and all this other bullshit it just should have looked out what the country needs and go for the best thing and now as a result we're seeing and it's not just this there's other companies like I went to Old Folsom today and I say yesterday and at least a third of the old shops there were either closed or going out of business the coffee place I go to they close down without a word it's just you're seeing more and more businesses closing down it's not just in the video game industry

614
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:29,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless of whatever path we took to get here, how are we going to get out?

615
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:32,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess would be my question.

616
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:33,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the end in sight?

617
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:34,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to get out of this anytime soon?

618
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:35,729
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it going to take?

619
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we just need to buy more video games or what?

620
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a lot more complex than that.

621
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:51,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of it is going to be consumers, you know, having more faith in the industries and, you know, putting their money into product.

622
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:59,797
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also going to mean that to be able to put money into the purchase of products, there need to be the jobs available.

623
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:01,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very much right now a catch 22.

624
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:02,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn if you do, damn if you don't.

625
00:40:05,422 --> 00:40:20,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really going to take, I think, the companies being able to be in a financial position to where they can start hiring again and start putting out more product so that these people who now have fresh incomes can go out and put their money back into the money flow.

626
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens in 2009.

627
00:40:23,376 --> 00:40:24,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it won't be much longer.

628
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:25,338
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see though.

629
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:26,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

630
00:40:27,879 --> 00:40:34,688
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all this news makes us very sad and upset and angry that all these great game studios are just closing their doors.

631
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:37,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some not so great, but they're all closing their doors.

632
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It just stinks.

633
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:39,554
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing stinks.

634
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:44,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we dedicate the FU's of the week to those without a job this week.

635
00:40:57,797 --> 00:40:58,798
[SPEAKER_02]: My first F.U.

636
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:02,041
[SPEAKER_02]: goes towards my girl bits for hurting me and causing me pain.

637
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:09,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, I have to turn around and hurt other people and cause them pain because they don't have to endure this type of thing, so we have to share it with them somehow.

638
00:41:11,148 --> 00:41:12,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, an F.U.

639
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:24,018
[SPEAKER_02]: goes on behalf of one of my friends who didn't necessarily say this herself, but I'm passing it on for her to the lack of proper transplants for her dad.

640
00:41:24,678 --> 00:41:24,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki,

641
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:52,306
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to rude people at the stores, especially at this time of year.

642
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:57,107
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some lady in front of us when we were trying to buy some, you know, gifts.

643
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:00,789
[SPEAKER_05]: And first off, she's taking forever with her transaction.

644
00:42:01,468 --> 00:42:02,769
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

645
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:30,456
[SPEAKER_05]: FU the rude people.

646
00:42:30,577 --> 00:42:36,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a ton of people who can't drive correctly, especially now in the rain, so... Screw them, too.

647
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:47,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm feeling pains in my side, and I don't know if I'm just imagining it, or if it's something weird happening again, or what have you.

648
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:48,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to go to the doctor.

649
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it is my uterus, I don't know.

650
00:42:50,888 --> 00:42:53,169
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I don't know, like, I just get freaked out.

651
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:54,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a hell of a year.

652
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want 2008 to go die in a fire.

653
00:42:56,856 --> 00:43:05,702
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I would like to tell the entire chat room, don't wish assassination, that's your wishing murder on somebody.

654
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:14,288
[SPEAKER_02]: However, complete incapacitation of both Bush and Cheney would be fantastic if someone were to do that, because that would put Pelosi in charge until Obama takes over.

655
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:15,769
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the Speaker of the House.

656
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:21,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I want to know, and my other FU goes to selfish people.

657
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:22,554
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

658
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:37,457
[SPEAKER_05]: In early 2009, we'll be receiving a brand new game from the creator of such wonderful games as Katamari Damacy and all the other sequels.

659
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:43,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Takahashi is releasing Nobi Nobi Boy on the PlayStation Network.

660
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:47,781
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a few videos that came out this week for it, and I still don't know what the hell this game's about.

661
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:51,343
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you're this stretchy thing that...

662
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:57,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to hook a bunch of things up with your body and I don't know what exactly that's supposed to be for.

663
00:43:58,156 --> 00:44:03,720
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently you can stretch your body, you can devour things.

664
00:44:05,221 --> 00:44:13,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really sure what exactly you do, but it's supposed to be coming out in Japan on January 29th for 800 yen.

665
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:17,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And the US probably around the same time, so early 2009.

666
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:20,285
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

667
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this looks really weird.

668
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, even, like, Katamari, you know, you can watch a tree and then get it.

669
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:37,882
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, oh, you roll over things and your ball gets bigger.

670
00:44:38,202 --> 00:44:42,923
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like a giant tube thing eating things and tying things up with its body.

671
00:44:43,703 --> 00:44:44,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get what the point is.

672
00:44:44,684 --> 00:44:45,764
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds fantastic.

673
00:44:45,844 --> 00:44:47,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Bizarro Snake.

674
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:49,365
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like a Bizarro Snake.

675
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:56,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, everyone's, like, all happy and stuff, and then he starts eating people, and it's like, oh my god, this isn't good at all.

676
00:44:56,847 --> 00:44:58,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Eating people is great.

677
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:00,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Nom, nom, nom.

678
00:45:00,768 --> 00:45:02,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobby Nobby's made of people.

679
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It's people!

680
00:45:06,472 --> 00:45:08,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, LittleBigPlanet got some updates this week.

681
00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:10,996
[SPEAKER_04]: It got two patches back-to-back, 1.06 and 1.07.

682
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:19,523
[SPEAKER_04]: 1.06, now it upgraded the moderation feature of the game, which a lot of people would say was badly needed.

683
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:24,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, your unpublished levels can be edited by creators.

684
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:25,728
[SPEAKER_04]: They will not be erased forever.

685
00:45:26,048 --> 00:45:26,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And, believe it or not,

686
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

687
00:45:57,023 --> 00:45:57,163
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

688
00:45:57,283 --> 00:45:57,863
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just what?

689
00:45:57,883 --> 00:45:57,963
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

690
00:46:26,446 --> 00:46:32,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I clicked on the link in the chat room that was posted by TigerClaw.

691
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:33,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think we're covering later in the show.

692
00:46:33,592 --> 00:46:34,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then never mind.

693
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:37,195
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I get.

694
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about some different news about SingStar?

695
00:46:42,018 --> 00:46:45,781
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing wireless microphones that will be out next year.

696
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:49,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're...

697
00:46:51,750 --> 00:47:03,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually saying that there's going to be 100 trial packs also available to, I guess, just a number of different SingStar followers on their MySpace.

698
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:12,987
[SPEAKER_02]: But the packs are going to be two wireless microphones, USB receiver, a mini BUSB cable, and four AA batteries.

699
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one for SingStar ABBA, which, by the way...

700
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:24,465
[SPEAKER_04]: There is now a SingStar ABBA theme in the PlayStation Network store that you can download for your PS3.

701
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:24,705
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

702
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:28,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we know it all yet, but it's coming out next year.

703
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:29,606
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

704
00:47:29,686 --> 00:47:33,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, that's coming out also in Europe, or may have already come out.

705
00:47:33,327 --> 00:47:33,727
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

706
00:47:33,787 --> 00:47:34,567
[SPEAKER_05]: SingStar Queen.

707
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:36,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.

708
00:47:36,227 --> 00:47:36,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice!

709
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard there was a Queen one coming out.

710
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:39,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally going to buy that.

711
00:47:39,508 --> 00:47:40,108
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's coming out in the U.S.

712
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:40,288
[SPEAKER_05]: now.

713
00:47:40,748 --> 00:47:41,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome!

714
00:47:41,688 --> 00:47:42,648
[SPEAKER_05]: That is exciting.

715
00:47:43,088 --> 00:47:45,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Queen is all sorts of awesome.

716
00:47:45,169 --> 00:47:46,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Queen is very awesome.

717
00:47:47,169 --> 00:47:49,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have the videos and everything, I bet, huh?

718
00:47:49,191 --> 00:47:50,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Rob, what is your favorite Queen song?

719
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:51,212
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be amazing.

720
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:58,478
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have to stick with the old Bohemian Rhapsody, but I do have a big love for Bicycle.

721
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:01,020
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Matt?

722
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:06,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Bohemian Rhapsody and No One Wants to Live Forever, I think.

723
00:48:07,305 --> 00:48:11,809
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite would be Somebody to Love.

724
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:13,350
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite of all time.

725
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:14,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a great song.

726
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:15,792
[SPEAKER_02]: My second is Killer Queen.

727
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:18,054
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all good songs.

728
00:48:18,274 --> 00:48:19,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for this game.

729
00:48:19,415 --> 00:48:20,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be amazing.

730
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:22,478
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the only thing that would be better?

731
00:48:22,758 --> 00:48:23,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be SingStar Journey.

732
00:48:23,899 --> 00:48:24,960
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I had to say it.

733
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,940
[SPEAKER_05]: SingStar Heart.

734
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:31,265
[SPEAKER_05]: See, now, it would only be good... I think that they should just do a Queen Pack for Rock Band, because that would be a lot better.

735
00:48:32,606 --> 00:48:34,467
[SPEAKER_04]: They do need to have SingStar Butt Rock.

736
00:48:35,188 --> 00:48:36,028
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be amazing.

737
00:48:36,168 --> 00:48:39,051
[SPEAKER_02]: With Poison and Motley Crue and...

738
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:41,692
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be sweet.

739
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:47,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd have to have Cinderella and Dokken and Night Ranger.

740
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:51,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And damn Yankees because of Ted Nugent.

741
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:54,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Ted Nugent!

742
00:48:55,202 --> 00:48:57,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's awesome and also from Sony.

743
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:07,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Pots upon 2 is out in Japan right now, but it will be coming to other regions in early 2009.

744
00:49:08,452 --> 00:49:10,173
[SPEAKER_05]: February in probably North America.

745
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um... Yeah, Patapon is actually pretty cool.

746
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:16,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get to play a lot of the game.

747
00:49:16,182 --> 00:49:19,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of gave up on it after a while, but it was fun.

748
00:49:20,323 --> 00:49:24,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely a unique little game, and, you know, I'd like to see more in that crazy style.

749
00:49:24,644 --> 00:49:27,125
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd also like to see it, like, on other systems, you know?

750
00:49:27,185 --> 00:49:29,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to have to always bring out the PSP to play this.

751
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:31,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Port that shit.

752
00:49:32,646 --> 00:49:34,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it'd look awesome on the PS3.

753
00:49:36,387 --> 00:49:38,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Patapatapatapon!

754
00:49:38,841 --> 00:49:40,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a very interesting little game.

755
00:49:41,024 --> 00:49:42,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, I'm cold.

756
00:49:42,826 --> 00:49:49,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be even better if the buttons spelled out or sung out Damn Yankee songs.

757
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:50,956
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

758
00:49:51,717 --> 00:49:51,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I...

759
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:54,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Hate everything about your mother.

760
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:56,449
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't Damn Yankees.

761
00:49:56,749 --> 00:49:59,150
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm thinking Ugly Kid Joe.

762
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

763
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:02,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking High Enough was Damn Yankees, wasn't it?

764
00:50:02,592 --> 00:50:04,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's fucking Ted Nugent.

765
00:50:06,974 --> 00:50:09,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Ted Nugent eats meat and shoots guns.

766
00:50:10,336 --> 00:50:11,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this man.

767
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:16,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw him on TV skinning a deer.

768
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Ted Nugent's fucking hot.

769
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:28,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, you won't be able to skin a deer in LittleBigPlanet, but you will get paint guns, which is kind of cool.

770
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:32,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a challenge out there for you folks to make a level where you do skin a deer.

771
00:50:33,432 --> 00:50:34,372
[SPEAKER_05]: You can probably do that.

772
00:50:35,373 --> 00:50:37,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to actually go back to Ranma.

773
00:50:38,253 --> 00:50:39,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Queensryche is the shit.

774
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:41,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Although you misspelled it.

775
00:50:41,514 --> 00:50:44,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the lead singer of Queensryche is a trained opera singer.

776
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:47,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just got this fantastic voice.

777
00:50:47,415 --> 00:50:47,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

778
00:50:48,135 --> 00:50:48,515
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

779
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:51,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see Sackboy's House of Blood in...

780
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:53,788
[SPEAKER_04]: and LittleBigPlanet.

781
00:50:53,808 --> 00:50:56,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see some really disturbing levels.

782
00:50:56,249 --> 00:51:07,676
[SPEAKER_05]: One time, and I just never got around to actually trying to make anything in this game, but thought about it, making a Saw-themed level, but I couldn't figure out how I could do that.

783
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:10,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

784
00:51:10,836 --> 00:51:11,016
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

785
00:51:11,036 --> 00:51:11,256
[SPEAKER_04]: But so why...

786
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:37,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Why then are there these new trophies?

787
00:51:37,724 --> 00:51:41,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Because shouldn't I get to play it still if somebody else makes the level using it?

788
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:42,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Or am I going to get locked out?

789
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:42,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

790
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:45,612
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

791
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,789
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

792
00:52:38,544 --> 00:52:39,605
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

793
00:52:59,248 --> 00:53:01,329
[SPEAKER_04]: The Holiday Pack is now apparently out.

794
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:03,669
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to come out December 18th for $2.99.

795
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:14,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the Festive Level Pack, and it's supposed to contain two new costumes, some new material, new objects, six new decorations, and tons and tons and tons of new stickers.

796
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:18,552
[SPEAKER_04]: But however, with this pack, levels themselves are not apparently included.

797
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:21,353
[SPEAKER_05]: But they just have the stickers, though.

798
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:21,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

799
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:30,802
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess you put this in your own levels or what have you because you can create new Christmas tree looking things and everything with the stickers.

800
00:53:31,122 --> 00:53:35,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, speaking of stickers, when are we going to get that feature where I can put photos from the hard drive into the game?

801
00:53:36,244 --> 00:53:38,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the other big thing we're waiting on.

802
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:40,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was in an advertisement.

803
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:41,767
[SPEAKER_04]: It's false advertising.

804
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:43,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch, whine, moan.

805
00:53:44,509 --> 00:53:44,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

806
00:53:44,949 --> 00:53:45,829
[SPEAKER_05]: You're never going to get it.

807
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:47,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish.

808
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe next year.

809
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:48,791
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

810
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,580
[SPEAKER_02]: SuperStreetFighter 2 Turbo HD Remix

811
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:04,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, there's a lot of suckers out there.

812
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:06,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have it.

813
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:07,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

814
00:54:07,234 --> 00:54:08,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got so many different versions of Street Fighter.

815
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:10,395
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even funny.

816
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,296
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 250,000 people sucking the cock of nostalgia.

817
00:54:14,576 --> 00:54:24,340
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically broken both day one and week one sales records and is slated to break 30-day sale records as well.

818
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's supposed to be the...

819
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:32,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, according to Capcom, it's quoted as saying it's on its way to becoming the highest-grossing digital title ever.

820
00:54:33,364 --> 00:54:36,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides that, they had the good sense to use Udon Kru to do their art, so that's pretty cool.

821
00:54:39,828 --> 00:54:40,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

822
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:41,229
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't sell one to me.

823
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:47,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, unfortunately, this week, there aren't that many choices for you to go purchase stuff.

824
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:55,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is the week of Christmas, and a lot of game publishers aren't exactly putting their games out this week because...

825
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,333
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a lot of time to purchase them.

826
00:54:58,453 --> 00:55:02,275
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are a few that are putting out their games.

827
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:06,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And, well, they're games, alright.

828
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Candice Kane's Candy Factory on the DS is coming out this week.

829
00:55:12,381 --> 00:55:14,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the Spore comic book creator.

830
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:16,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know if that's a game.

831
00:55:16,224 --> 00:55:17,884
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more software, I think.

832
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:20,386
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's coming out nonetheless.

833
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:23,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

834
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:33,198
[SPEAKER_05]: and Mystery PI Portrait of a Thief on DS.

835
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:37,279
[SPEAKER_05]: And I swear that I think that's it.

836
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,580
[SPEAKER_05]: That is it.

837
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,461
[SPEAKER_04]: That is sad.

838
00:55:44,764 --> 00:55:45,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

839
00:56:04,173 --> 00:56:07,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, on the PlayStation 3, you also get Alone in the Dark.

840
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:14,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Far Cry 2 and Bioshock get their Japanese translations, as well as another port of Civ Revolution.

841
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:16,936
[SPEAKER_04]: But also some other games.

842
00:56:17,236 --> 00:56:20,497
[SPEAKER_04]: White Knight Chronicles is coming out this week, as well as another game.

843
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:21,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what this is.

844
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:23,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's an actual gaming stick.

845
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:23,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's not a game.

846
00:56:24,038 --> 00:56:25,038
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like joystick.

847
00:56:25,078 --> 00:56:27,199
[SPEAKER_04]: They call the... Don't laugh.

848
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,739
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Roid Stick DS.

849
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:29,599
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

850
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,140
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a couple games I missed, but I don't...

851
00:56:33,996 --> 00:56:42,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun Fun Mini Golf on the Wii Tiki Towers on the Wii I think those are both download games and then Dreamer Horse Trainer and Dreamer Puppy Trainer on DS

852
00:56:46,524 --> 00:56:49,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Peekman gets its Wii upgrade this week as well.

853
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:10,800
[SPEAKER_04]: or Pikmin, Pikmin, whatever.

854
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:13,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's that Biohazard Zero.

855
00:57:13,724 --> 00:57:15,285
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be what it is.

856
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:19,430
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2, Lego Batman comes out this week and that's about it.

857
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:27,259
[SPEAKER_04]: On the handhelds, you have on the Nintendo DS...

858
00:57:28,393 --> 00:57:32,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Biohazard, Deadly Silence, Happy My Sweets, Phantasy Star Zero, Sony PSP,

860
00:57:59,287 --> 00:58:13,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Our branch of my work that's in Dallas that houses most of our game reps Genius Products is bringing out that game Scratch to playtest for them You know that new DJing game that's supposed to be like Beatmania?

861
00:58:14,514 --> 00:58:14,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

862
00:58:15,394 --> 00:58:18,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, with the Newmark turntables or something like that.

863
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:19,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can get some pictures or something.

864
00:58:20,696 --> 00:58:21,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's only in Dallas.

865
00:58:21,817 --> 00:58:23,717
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't give a crap about that stuff anyway.

866
00:58:23,797 --> 00:58:24,778
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what pisses me off.

867
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:27,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally excited to play it.

868
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:29,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

869
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on around the world with more releases.

870
00:58:33,021 --> 00:58:34,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Two things for the UK.

871
00:58:35,161 --> 00:58:37,222
[SPEAKER_02]: The 23rd is Savage Moon on PlayStation 3.

872
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:42,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the 26th, Boxing Day is 100 Classic Book Collection.

873
00:58:44,594 --> 00:58:44,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

874
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:47,115
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not a big week in games.

875
00:58:47,835 --> 00:58:49,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I reckon not.

876
00:58:49,516 --> 00:58:50,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, there you have it.

877
00:58:50,536 --> 00:58:53,097
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to do the release dates no matter what, even if it's a slow week.

878
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,518
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't expect next week to be much better.

879
00:58:56,398 --> 00:58:57,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not.

880
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:01,100
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know what is pretty big?

881
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,741
[SPEAKER_05]: The text in Banjo-Kazooie now.

882
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:12,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's that brand new patch for those people that own the 14-inch standard definition tube TVs.

883
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:18,004
[SPEAKER_05]: You now can read your text in Banjo-Kazooie and suffer through the dialogue of that game.

884
00:59:19,605 --> 00:59:20,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurrah!

885
00:59:21,426 --> 00:59:31,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um... Well, thank heavens, because, you know, I was just waiting for the... No, actually, a lot of people really were waiting for something like this to come out, because if you play it on the small TV, this game's next to impossible to play.

886
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:37,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm spoiled with my HDTV, so I need to just stop taunting those that don't have it.

887
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:38,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct?

888
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:38,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

889
00:59:39,286 --> 00:59:40,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, alright.

890
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:51,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, we're just about to the end of Part A tonight, but hey, we've got to take some time to recognize gaming's classics, and that's what we do here in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

891
00:59:55,282 --> 01:00:02,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, DarkSakura, what have you picked for this very special holiday week for the kids and adults out there to recognize this week in gaming?

892
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:09,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I've picked a bit of NES and Commodore 64 for you, Rob.

893
01:00:09,615 --> 01:00:09,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

894
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:12,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Joy, in the form of Maniac Mansion.

895
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:18,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Maniac Mansion is a weird little game.

896
01:00:20,262 --> 01:00:24,145
[SPEAKER_04]: This music's from the NES version.

897
01:00:24,565 --> 01:00:26,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

898
01:00:27,807 --> 01:00:30,009
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was originally on the Commodore 64.

899
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:30,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So where...

900
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:43,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually is the game that the Scum Engine was created for, the script creation utility for Maniac Mansion.

901
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:48,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And LucasArts used it for about 10 more years to keep playing it.

902
01:00:48,506 --> 01:00:50,788
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has Chuck LaPlante in it.

903
01:00:51,408 --> 01:00:52,630
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

904
01:01:07,766 --> 01:01:29,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, there were changes in the people that lived there, and then people that were in the hospital started disappearing, so then there were a bunch of people who decided to go into the house because a local cheerleader turned up missing, and they decided to go through the entire house, which is like this big...

905
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:37,354
[SPEAKER_02]: B-movie type horror house thing with tentacles and an evil genius and the pool.

906
01:01:38,154 --> 01:01:40,295
[SPEAKER_02]: The pool is the best part.

907
01:01:40,415 --> 01:01:42,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It has multiple endings.

908
01:01:42,796 --> 01:01:43,757
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go through.

909
01:01:43,777 --> 01:01:45,538
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on who lives, who dies.

910
01:01:46,198 --> 01:01:48,159
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a perfect ending.

911
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:50,620
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have the adversary win.

912
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:56,063
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have them famous by publishing his autobiography.

913
01:01:56,143 --> 01:01:57,403
[SPEAKER_02]: You can feed him to a plant.

914
01:01:58,644 --> 01:01:58,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

915
01:02:00,004 --> 01:02:08,449
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can get your players in the game killed and it has different red herrings in it and

916
01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:13,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of different weird stuff in the game.

917
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:19,902
[SPEAKER_02]: The different characters in there is you have the sort of James Dean type character.

918
01:02:20,062 --> 01:02:21,983
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a New Wave musician.

919
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:24,344
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a photographer.

920
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:26,145
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a novelist.

921
01:02:27,805 --> 01:02:31,386
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a big nerd who's really scared.

922
01:02:31,446 --> 01:02:31,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, nerd!

923
01:02:33,067 --> 01:02:35,508
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a punk rock girl.

924
01:02:36,468 --> 01:02:39,349
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Surfer in there.

925
01:02:39,409 --> 01:02:41,150
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have their different strengths and weaknesses.

926
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:46,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've played this, of course, on the NES, because that's what I had.

927
01:02:49,913 --> 01:02:57,776
[SPEAKER_02]: The different versions there were, there was also a PC that also played...

928
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Apple II, Amiga, Atari ST, NES

929
01:03:15,695 --> 01:03:19,719
[SPEAKER_02]: and there is actually an enhanced version with updated graphics that's out.

930
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:22,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had a sitcom based on the series.

931
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:23,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever remember watching that?

932
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:25,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I remember that!

933
01:03:25,504 --> 01:03:27,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, that was not very long, but yeah, I remember there was.

934
01:03:27,526 --> 01:03:29,107
[SPEAKER_04]: This game was pretty big when it came out.

935
01:03:29,328 --> 01:03:37,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a fan remake that's called Maniac Mansion Deluxe that runs on Windows that has really...

936
01:03:38,596 --> 01:04:04,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Enhanced Graphics and Music That was actually borrowed from Day of the Tentacle And it's supposed to fix a lot of bugs and inconsistencies And they put in some different changes to make it a little bit harder It's also playable in Day of the Tentacle Maniac Mansion And of course then there was It was really, really censored though on the NES There were a lot of stuff changed Um

937
01:04:07,117 --> 01:04:07,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

938
01:04:07,737 --> 01:04:08,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww.

939
01:04:29,545 --> 01:04:43,512
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy, though, that ported it, Douglas Crockford, put out a memoir that was called The Expurgation of Maniac Mansion, which was basically him going, God, Nintendo, you suck.

940
01:04:45,238 --> 01:05:07,019
[SPEAKER_02]: about how strict Nintendo was for what they could allow in the game and what they couldn't and about some things that he agreed with taking out like Edna having sexually themed threats to the characters and different things including the use of violence, non-violence and that type of thing.

941
01:05:10,984 --> 01:05:17,029
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it was pretty heavily censored, like I said.

942
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:23,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, like I was saying before, it was my favorite part of the game.

943
01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:32,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I would just get really tired of playing it and go to hell with this, I would go to the pool, drain it, and push the red button so that the house would explode.

944
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:36,223
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what I did every time.

945
01:05:36,243 --> 01:05:38,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm tired of playing!

946
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:39,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Explode!

947
01:05:39,964 --> 01:05:40,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Game over.

948
01:05:43,444 --> 01:05:47,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think the graphics on the NES version were that great compared to the computer one.

949
01:05:47,785 --> 01:05:47,985
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

950
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:56,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is strange, because I'm talking about a game on the Commodore 64, but... The Commodore 64 version was actually really nice.

951
01:05:56,707 --> 01:05:59,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally did not play it, but I have seen it played.

952
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:02,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like I said, I didn't have a Commodore 64.

953
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:05,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a click-go-at-em.

954
01:06:06,393 --> 01:06:11,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, though, as far as this type of game goes on the NES, there is a game I do prefer, these point-and-click games.

955
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:12,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadowgate.

956
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:14,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadowgate was great!

957
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:18,023
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what part I would always get stuck at?

958
01:06:18,483 --> 01:06:25,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It was where you went into the portal and you had a limited time with your... You had to actually have some item to make it through the portal.

959
01:06:25,369 --> 01:06:26,790
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna need to do that in a future week.

960
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:27,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna have to.

961
01:06:28,111 --> 01:06:30,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually never finished Shadowgate, but I love Shadowgate.

962
01:06:31,274 --> 01:06:31,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

963
01:06:32,645 --> 01:06:35,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just interesting because you don't think about these point-and-click games a lot on the NES.

964
01:06:36,772 --> 01:06:37,854
[SPEAKER_04]: But there were some really good ones.

965
01:06:39,676 --> 01:06:42,717
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, this, it's a really good one.

966
01:06:42,797 --> 01:06:53,642
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, also, uh, some of the, uh, LucasArts, uh, I was just looking at the list of the different LucasArts, uh, um, titles that were supposed to go along with the SCUMM engine.

967
01:06:54,683 --> 01:06:57,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me get back to that because I was just on it.

968
01:06:57,084 --> 01:06:59,565
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, um, I think a couple of Monkey Island games.

969
01:07:01,026 --> 01:07:02,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, Labyrinth and Loom.

970
01:07:03,867 --> 01:07:05,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I've covered Loom before.

971
01:07:05,948 --> 01:07:06,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

972
01:07:06,553 --> 01:07:09,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is strange because I think Loom came out before Maniac Mansion, didn't it?

973
01:07:10,677 --> 01:07:11,338
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was after.

974
01:07:11,378 --> 01:07:11,618
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

975
01:07:11,658 --> 01:07:12,399
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was after.

976
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:13,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Strange.

977
01:07:14,141 --> 01:07:15,842
[SPEAKER_05]: It was after Monkey Island even, I think.

978
01:07:17,824 --> 01:07:23,290
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, and actually one of the Sam and Max games was supposed to use it, but they cancelled it.

979
01:07:25,937 --> 01:07:32,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam & Max Freelance Police Full Throttle Payback Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis

980
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you have it.

981
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:47,522
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's nothing else to add, then your classic game of the week is... Blow up the house!

982
01:07:48,422 --> 01:07:54,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Maniac Mansion on the NES or Commodore 64, whatever system you prefer.

983
01:07:54,724 --> 01:07:55,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Maniac Mansion.

984
01:07:55,464 --> 01:07:57,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't forget to drain the water from the pool and blow up the house!

985
01:07:58,144 --> 01:07:59,705
[SPEAKER_04]: That's DarkSakura's favorite thing to do, correct?

986
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:01,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed!

987
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:02,401
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

988
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:07,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio and do some music here.

989
01:08:08,103 --> 01:08:10,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we come back, we have plenty more.

990
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, sorry, the podcast folks, you won't get to hear the music.

991
01:08:13,044 --> 01:08:13,804
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the way it is.

992
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:14,985
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, copyright rules and everything.

993
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:23,688
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll be back really soon with more of Orange Lounge Radio, more stories, hopefully a little bit happier than all the layoff stories we had in Part A. Do you think we can arrange that, Loki?

994
01:08:23,748 --> 01:08:25,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some happier stuff in Part B tonight?

995
01:08:26,209 --> 01:08:26,749
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll try.

996
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:30,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, we're going to go ahead and take a break, and we will be right back.

997
01:08:36,218 --> 01:08:43,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And welcome back to more of Orange Lounge Radio and this Part B of our podcast for this December the 21st of 2008.

998
01:08:43,383 --> 01:08:46,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And happy holidays to you guys out there listening to the program.

999
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:53,790
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked a lot about different things going on in Part A. Unfortunately, a lot of really not-so-happy holidays going on for a lot of folks in the game industry.

1000
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:55,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Bummer to hear that.

1001
01:08:56,292 --> 01:09:04,257
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked also about some other news, including some sales stuff about HD Remix and some little Big Planet updates and stuff.

1002
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:05,658
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1003
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:30,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Still going to be $10.

1004
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:35,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they ran into some unexpected technical difficulties.

1005
01:09:37,543 --> 01:09:39,684
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they didn't call it Balloon Knot Hole Island.

1006
01:09:39,844 --> 01:09:41,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would have been really bad.

1007
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,867
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be horrible.

1008
01:09:47,368 --> 01:09:48,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the delay?

1009
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:51,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Unexpected technical difficulties.

1010
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever that's supposed to mean.

1011
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:56,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone took some time off for the holidays.

1012
01:09:56,551 --> 01:09:59,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I still don't think it's a good name to name it Knothole Island anyways.

1013
01:09:59,672 --> 01:10:02,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It just makes me think of like a glory hole.

1014
01:10:03,013 --> 01:10:05,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, haven't you ever heard of what a balloon knot is?

1015
01:10:06,154 --> 01:10:07,675
[SPEAKER_04]: That's supposed to be like an asshole.

1016
01:10:08,055 --> 01:10:09,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know what a balloon knot looks like?

1017
01:10:10,436 --> 01:10:11,116
[SPEAKER_02]: An asshole.

1018
01:10:11,276 --> 01:10:11,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1019
01:10:11,936 --> 01:10:13,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one helps in San Diego.

1020
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:20,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I hear Knothole Island, I keep thinking of a balloon knothole and it's disgusting.

1021
01:10:20,572 --> 01:10:24,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, who wants to visit an island with a bunch of assholes?

1022
01:10:24,835 --> 01:10:27,196
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a house in San Diego that looks like a sphincter.

1023
01:10:27,876 --> 01:10:30,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Make all the gay jokes you want, but that does not sound appealing.

1024
01:10:30,378 --> 01:10:30,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1025
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:32,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you have it.

1026
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:36,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1027
01:10:38,323 --> 01:10:38,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1028
01:10:40,164 --> 01:10:40,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'll move on.

1029
01:10:40,984 --> 01:10:43,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to eat a bagel while I'm talking and making jokes.

1030
01:10:43,946 --> 01:10:44,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to stop eating cookies.

1031
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:53,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw says every time I hear Knothole I'm thinking of Sonic AM Moving on

1032
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:00,024
[SPEAKER_04]: 800-point Microsoft point cards now have made their way into the retail marketplace.

1033
01:11:01,064 --> 01:11:04,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, you could only get 1,600 Microsoft points before.

1034
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:05,707
[SPEAKER_04]: It was $19.99.

1035
01:11:06,268 --> 01:11:10,050
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you can get 800 Microsoft point cards at retailers for $9.99.

1036
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:14,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And, hey, that would be one whole cent cheaper than buying them online.

1037
01:11:14,433 --> 01:11:15,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but you have to pay tax.

1038
01:11:16,054 --> 01:11:17,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're screwed.

1039
01:11:17,615 --> 01:11:18,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have to consider there's tax.

1040
01:11:19,016 --> 01:11:23,219
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good if you want to give a gift or if, like, you know...

1041
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:25,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have a credit card and you're a little kid.

1042
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:33,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you want to buy it as a gift, but it's a stocking stuffer, so maybe $20 is too much.

1043
01:11:33,341 --> 01:11:33,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1044
01:11:34,001 --> 01:11:34,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Just buy it online.

1045
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:35,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess.

1046
01:11:35,921 --> 01:11:36,741
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I want?

1047
01:11:37,762 --> 01:11:38,262
[SPEAKER_05]: World Peace?

1048
01:11:38,582 --> 01:11:39,302
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not World Peace.

1049
01:11:39,322 --> 01:11:39,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Screw World Peace.

1050
01:11:41,082 --> 01:11:44,763
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're not available in most stores is those PlayStation Network cards.

1051
01:11:45,243 --> 01:11:49,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I hate the PlayStation Network and how they do their payments online.

1052
01:11:49,864 --> 01:11:50,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a little silly.

1053
01:11:50,744 --> 01:11:51,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it.

1054
01:11:51,245 --> 01:11:59,788
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, speaking of PlayStation Network, because you brought it up and I forgot to mention earlier in the show, we talked about PlayStation Home last week and I said I was going to get an OLR club as soon as they opened it up.

1055
01:12:00,128 --> 01:12:04,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess I missed it because I went back online later in the week and I saw where you could buy a clubhouse online.

1056
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:05,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just hard to find.

1057
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:11,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not interested in it because you have to invite people into the club and you can only invite up to like 30 people.

1058
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,034
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of an OLR club is that?

1059
01:12:14,614 --> 01:12:16,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a cool one, unfortunately.

1060
01:12:16,175 --> 01:12:16,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1061
01:12:16,475 --> 01:12:18,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We have more than 30 people in our chat room tonight.

1062
01:12:18,296 --> 01:12:19,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably would have more people now than we do.

1063
01:12:20,278 --> 01:12:27,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was something that people would be able to search and go into at their leisure, but I don't see how it's promotion for the show to do that.

1064
01:12:27,922 --> 01:12:28,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds stupid.

1065
01:12:28,743 --> 01:12:30,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'd have to buy all the furniture, so forget it!

1066
01:12:32,116 --> 01:12:33,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Until home gets cooler, I protest.

1067
01:12:34,277 --> 01:12:34,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1068
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:37,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are probably only about 30 of our listeners that actually have a PlayStation 3.

1069
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,681
[SPEAKER_04]: True, true.

1070
01:12:40,281 --> 01:12:41,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the sales numbers.

1071
01:12:41,562 --> 01:12:45,204
[SPEAKER_04]: SJ100Matt in our chat room wants to point out, I see PSN cards in Best Buy.

1072
01:12:45,685 --> 01:12:47,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Entertainment says, not only that, clubs cost money.

1073
01:12:47,766 --> 01:12:47,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Fail.

1074
01:12:48,306 --> 01:12:50,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I was willing to, like, for five bucks, I would have done it.

1075
01:12:50,968 --> 01:12:51,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's an experiment.

1076
01:12:51,889 --> 01:12:52,529
[SPEAKER_04]: How much was it?

1077
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:53,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Five bucks.

1078
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Five bucks?

1079
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:54,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1080
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:55,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it five bucks per month or year?

1081
01:12:55,431 --> 01:12:55,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still considering it.

1082
01:12:57,032 --> 01:13:02,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it's $5 with no reoccurring fee, but Sony is going to implement them at some point.

1083
01:13:03,276 --> 01:13:03,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't say when.

1084
01:13:04,236 --> 01:13:06,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, home doesn't suck enough.

1085
01:13:07,378 --> 01:13:09,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, do we have the trophy rooms and stuff?

1086
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1087
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:14,522
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like most things, it's extremely early.

1088
01:13:14,622 --> 01:13:18,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure home will be better in a year, but by then we will have all forgotten.

1089
01:13:18,545 --> 01:13:20,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Home is extremely late as it is.

1090
01:13:20,746 --> 01:13:22,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no time for being early.

1091
01:13:22,547 --> 01:13:23,267
[SPEAKER_05]: It's late.

1092
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:25,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1093
01:13:26,423 --> 01:13:26,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1094
01:13:26,823 --> 01:13:27,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sorry.

1095
01:13:27,244 --> 01:13:30,346
[SPEAKER_04]: We can go back to other stuff now.

1096
01:13:30,586 --> 01:13:31,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jamie.

1097
01:13:32,248 --> 01:13:32,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1098
01:13:33,549 --> 01:13:34,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega!

1099
01:13:35,691 --> 01:13:36,131
[SPEAKER_04]: What about them?

1100
01:13:36,731 --> 01:13:47,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it looks like there's been some ESRB ratings put out, so that means that there are going to be a number of games on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network from Sega.

1101
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:54,266
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be Sonic 3, Comic Zone, Phantasy Star 2, and Gunstar Heroes.

1102
01:13:54,426 --> 01:13:55,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo-hoo!

1103
01:13:56,127 --> 01:13:59,650
[SPEAKER_02]: which are supposed to be out.

1104
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:02,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there were, I guess, other releases.

1105
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:10,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the previous releases were Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic 2, Golden Axe, Echo the Dolphin, and Streets of Rage 2.

1106
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:16,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, but isn't Sega putting out that thing of like 40 games for like 20 bucks or something?

1107
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

1108
01:14:18,527 --> 01:14:21,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that Sega wants as much money as possible?

1109
01:14:21,469 --> 01:14:21,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1110
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:22,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1111
01:14:23,611 --> 01:14:24,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega!

1112
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:25,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they giving me anything special?

1113
01:14:26,994 --> 01:14:27,775
[SPEAKER_04]: More achievements?

1114
01:14:28,595 --> 01:14:29,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

1115
01:14:29,176 --> 01:14:34,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're gonna give you the option to blur it out so that it looks all, like, you know, HD-like.

1116
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:37,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Just buy the $20 thing when it comes out.

1117
01:14:37,383 --> 01:14:38,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1118
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:40,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless they're actually remaking everything.

1119
01:14:43,356 --> 01:14:44,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I highly doubt that they are.

1120
01:14:45,156 --> 01:14:45,857
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

1121
01:14:46,497 --> 01:14:50,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else coming to Xbox Live Arcade, kind of interesting.

1122
01:14:51,438 --> 01:14:57,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure a lot of people are familiar with the MMORPG DOFUS.

1123
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:02,140
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a game, I think it's called Wakfu.

1124
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:07,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And now the islands of Wakfu are going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1125
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,942
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like an MMO, but not.

1126
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:11,923
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1127
01:15:40,838 --> 01:15:42,019
[SPEAKER_04]: An adventure beat-em-up?

1128
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:43,660
[SPEAKER_04]: An adventure beat-em-up.

1129
01:15:44,121 --> 01:15:47,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an adventure slash beat-em-up all-style game.

1130
01:15:47,863 --> 01:15:56,950
[SPEAKER_05]: It says it can be played in a two-player team mode and will reveal never-before-seen background content from the world of Dofus and Wakfu.

1131
01:15:58,931 --> 01:16:04,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, because to me, the entire world of Dofus and Wakfu are unseen and I have not played either one.

1132
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:10,051
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, it's a different type of game and that's always welcome.

1133
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:14,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Bochikawa in chat asks, Wakfu, is that like beating people senseless with a frying pan?

1134
01:16:16,053 --> 01:16:17,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is, exactly.

1135
01:16:17,654 --> 01:16:19,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that would be a great game.

1136
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:20,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1137
01:16:50,051 --> 01:16:51,132
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1138
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:11,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1139
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:30,221
[SPEAKER_05]: PowerSwitch and stuff, it's really funky.

1140
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:38,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the PowerSwitch, there's a little button that's off-center on it, so if you push it in the center of your faceplate, it won't exactly trigger it every time.

1141
01:17:38,868 --> 01:17:40,149
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of have to push to the right of it.

1142
01:17:41,451 --> 01:17:45,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and the way the eject button works is kind of similar.

1143
01:17:45,294 --> 01:17:48,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little push-button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out.

1144
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:56,123
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, you can always, if you can't get it to eject that way, just, you know, hit the middle button and select eject disc.

1145
01:17:57,694 --> 01:18:01,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, Jrod in chat says, I used to have to do that and it ended up where the disk drive wouldn't read anymore.

1146
01:18:02,443 --> 01:18:02,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovely.

1147
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:08,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, they won't warranty it unless it red rings, so that's when you take a blowtorch to it.

1148
01:18:09,624 --> 01:18:11,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, look, there's some other options, too.

1149
01:18:11,105 --> 01:18:16,746
[SPEAKER_04]: The other options were to slow down the disc rotation speed, but that was rejected because it would have slowed down the game loading times.

1150
01:18:16,806 --> 01:18:17,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can understand that one.

1151
01:18:18,686 --> 01:18:26,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, apparently, the other option was to install little bumpers that would have cost the company between $35 to $75 million additional dollars.

1152
01:18:26,987 --> 01:18:30,328
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would think little bumpers, wouldn't that be maybe like a buck?

1153
01:18:31,383 --> 01:18:31,843
[SPEAKER_04]: A machine?

1154
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:34,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's literally that little.

1155
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:40,250
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a fix a long time ago when people were writing a scratch thing that was available online.

1156
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:50,399
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd buy these little... It looked like a CD, and you would put it in the drive and kind of push it up, and it would stick little pads on there that would keep the disc from jiggling.

1157
01:18:50,419 --> 01:18:59,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Because basically what happens is since the disc has so much play inside the drive, it'll end up bending back to where it rubs up against the laser, and that's what carves a nice little...

1158
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:01,308
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1159
01:19:11,943 --> 01:19:22,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing is that... And the big thing that the document shows is that Microsoft, what they eventually decided to do, they appended the manual with a warning and offered a disk replacement program.

1160
01:19:22,786 --> 01:19:24,187
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that was their big fix.

1161
01:19:24,347 --> 01:19:29,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe something about like a sticker on the door, too, that you have to pull off that warns them not to tilt the machine when you play.

1162
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:34,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, this was deemed insufficient by company employees via an internal email.

1163
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,150
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's apparently what happened anyway.

1164
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is kind of... I mean...

1165
01:19:40,632 --> 01:19:48,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a stupid fix, and really they should have just added those little bumpers to it, because it wouldn't have cost them $75 million.

1166
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how many consoles do they have out there?

1167
01:19:50,117 --> 01:19:57,220
[SPEAKER_05]: They have like almost 15,000, you know, 15 million consoles, or not even really that many, but like over 10 million consoles, okay?

1168
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they're saying $75 million, so that's $750 per console.

1169
01:20:00,722 --> 01:20:01,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Or no, that's $75 million.

1170
01:20:01,742 --> 01:20:05,264
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be $0.75 per console, basically.

1171
01:20:05,324 --> 01:20:05,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1172
01:20:12,154 --> 01:20:13,375
[SPEAKER_05]: No, my math's all wrong today.

1173
01:20:13,695 --> 01:20:13,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1174
01:20:14,275 --> 01:20:14,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

1175
01:20:14,955 --> 01:20:16,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, it's not going to cost that much.

1176
01:20:16,636 --> 01:20:19,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in chat says, but who the fuck moves around a console when playing a game?

1177
01:20:20,037 --> 01:20:20,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1178
01:20:21,837 --> 01:20:28,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, some people own pets like my cat who likes to jump on consoles and she may knock it over.

1179
01:20:28,959 --> 01:20:37,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily, I'm smart enough to know if the cat's nearby the console, I will lay it flat on the ground instead of tipping up and that's a rare occasion.

1180
01:20:37,622 --> 01:20:40,523
[SPEAKER_02]: We just tuck ours away where she can't get to it.

1181
01:20:40,888 --> 01:20:42,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, someone can bump it.

1182
01:20:42,809 --> 01:20:45,691
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a court get pulled or something and knock the console over.

1183
01:20:46,131 --> 01:20:47,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's all sorts of stuff that can happen.

1184
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:55,958
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rare, but there are cases, though, I've been hearing where people are just getting a groove carved into it just from leaving it

1185
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,840
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1186
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:29,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened to that controller that was supposedly coming out that had a better D-pad?

1187
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:30,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I never saw that.

1188
01:21:31,106 --> 01:21:34,049
[SPEAKER_05]: And why they would do that for a limited amount of time is retarded.

1189
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:35,671
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.

1190
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:37,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea why they would do that.

1191
01:21:38,214 --> 01:21:39,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tigerclaw wants to say...

1192
01:21:41,258 --> 01:21:42,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft needs to fix the tray eject problem.

1193
01:21:42,379 --> 01:21:43,641
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are experiencing it.

1194
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:44,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the only one.

1195
01:21:57,515 --> 01:22:01,399
[SPEAKER_04]: and Bobby Blackwolf wanted to work in a cheap plug for his upcoming new show.

1196
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:07,645
[SPEAKER_04]: He said the first episode of Friday Night Gaming will address that issue directly on stage with a company that repairs consoles.

1197
01:22:07,685 --> 01:22:11,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently one little shtick they're going to do on their show is actually repair consoles live on air.

1198
01:22:12,455 --> 01:22:13,356
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1199
01:22:35,168 --> 01:22:40,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the device to do it, let alone the patience or the skill necessary.

1200
01:23:03,393 --> 01:23:06,816
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to do any more news, we're done, we're out of here Have a great night everybody Bye

1201
01:23:27,665 --> 01:23:30,127
[SPEAKER_04]: So mailbagorangepontradio.com Let's read some of those emails.

1202
01:23:31,688 --> 01:23:33,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey OLR, this is Amasa Tsuma.

1203
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:39,754
[SPEAKER_02]: My question to you is if you were able to throw an object at someone, what would that object be and who would you throw it at?

1204
01:23:39,834 --> 01:23:40,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Must be non-lethal.

1205
01:23:41,896 --> 01:23:44,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this have something to do with the bush shoe thing this week?

1206
01:23:44,898 --> 01:23:45,179
[SPEAKER_04]: It must.

1207
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:45,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1208
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:58,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually would, if I could completely get away with it without, you know, the Secret Service trying to jump me or anything, I would throw something at Bush.

1209
01:23:59,136 --> 01:24:06,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I would throw basically the waste of a homeless person at him.

1210
01:24:08,862 --> 01:24:09,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Feces?

1211
01:24:09,122 --> 01:24:09,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Feces.

1212
01:24:10,413 --> 01:24:11,455
[SPEAKER_02]: No, over all waste.

1213
01:24:11,575 --> 01:24:12,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1214
01:24:12,476 --> 01:24:12,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1215
01:24:13,518 --> 01:24:14,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And say that it was his fault.

1216
01:24:17,003 --> 01:24:18,104
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's hypothetical.

1217
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:20,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I would physically do that.

1218
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:25,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not breaking any sort of constitutional law by saying it would be cool if that were to happen.

1219
01:24:28,118 --> 01:24:28,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I answer?

1220
01:24:28,578 --> 01:24:29,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I answer?

1221
01:24:29,379 --> 01:24:30,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

1222
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:34,401
[SPEAKER_04]: That crazy, messed up, fags-go-to-hell guy.

1223
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:35,061
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that guy?

1224
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:35,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Phelps.

1225
01:24:35,541 --> 01:24:36,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Phelps, yes.

1226
01:24:37,082 --> 01:24:41,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to throw a cream pie at him, but what a waste of a yummy pie.

1227
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:45,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will throw... Throw rainbow sparkles at him.

1228
01:24:45,045 --> 01:24:45,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Feces pie!

1229
01:24:47,446 --> 01:24:48,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some shit cake.

1230
01:24:51,287 --> 01:24:52,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, Fred Phelps, have a shit cake.

1231
01:24:55,509 --> 01:24:56,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.

1232
01:24:57,239 --> 01:24:58,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Millions of dollars at my cell.

1233
01:25:02,141 --> 01:25:04,282
[SPEAKER_02]: That would mean you'd have to have it to throw it at yourself first.

1234
01:25:04,342 --> 01:25:09,184
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I would have to have a million dollars in my hand, which means I would have acquired millions of dollars.

1235
01:25:10,204 --> 01:25:11,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Win-win either way, I have to look at it.

1236
01:25:12,785 --> 01:25:15,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that we've invented a new word on the show tonight, shit cake.

1237
01:25:15,946 --> 01:25:16,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1238
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use that in a sentence three times this week.

1239
01:25:18,979 --> 01:25:20,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Shitcake, shitcake, shitcake.

1240
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up and go eat shitcake.

1241
01:25:23,102 --> 01:25:26,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, last week you asked for Christmas e-cards and I decided to make one.

1242
01:25:26,685 --> 01:25:31,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I suck at Photoshop, I made it using this Microsoft Flash app that uses your 360 avatars.

1243
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:33,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you will enjoy it.

1244
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:33,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Sat.

1245
01:25:34,351 --> 01:25:35,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.

1246
01:25:35,292 --> 01:25:37,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Joker avatar in front of a fire.

1247
01:25:37,894 --> 01:25:39,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I saw that as his signature on another forum.

1248
01:25:39,796 --> 01:25:40,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was funny.

1249
01:25:42,258 --> 01:25:43,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1250
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:43,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1251
01:25:47,526 --> 01:25:48,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, crew of OLR.

1252
01:25:49,047 --> 01:25:51,028
[SPEAKER_02]: It is I, Katakos, a.k.a.

1253
01:25:51,088 --> 01:25:57,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Reese, here to tell you and to anyone else who plays Stepmania that I have made a song for download.

1254
01:25:58,532 --> 01:26:00,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just post a link in the chat room.

1255
01:26:01,493 --> 01:26:05,615
[SPEAKER_02]: But are you guys slash girl impressed with the 2009 PSP games?

1256
01:26:05,796 --> 01:26:09,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, has anyone heard anything about Elder Scrolls Travels for PSP?

1257
01:26:10,758 --> 01:26:17,593
[SPEAKER_02]: and do you really think there will be not T-H-E-I-R, it should be T-H-E-R-E?

1258
01:26:17,613 --> 01:26:19,357
[SPEAKER_02]: He's typing on a PSP.

1259
01:26:20,529 --> 01:26:21,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

1260
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:21,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Spelling is spelling.

1261
01:26:23,431 --> 01:26:25,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, E and R are right next to each other.

1262
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: E and I are not.

1263
01:26:27,913 --> 01:26:28,733
[SPEAKER_02]: If it uses QWERTY.

1264
01:26:29,674 --> 01:26:32,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that there will be a little big planet for PSP?

1265
01:26:33,556 --> 01:26:33,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1266
01:26:34,116 --> 01:26:37,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you enjoy this song as much as I enjoy your show.

1267
01:26:37,478 --> 01:26:39,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Reese, BC, Canada.

1268
01:26:39,839 --> 01:26:40,720
[SPEAKER_02]: My birthday is December 26th.

1269
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:40,880
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL15Woo.

1270
01:26:43,963 --> 01:26:44,784
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP, PSP, PSP

1271
01:27:01,172 --> 01:27:01,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1272
01:27:01,692 --> 01:27:01,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1273
01:27:02,572 --> 01:27:04,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me some of the titles I have to look forward to.

1274
01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:08,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Ocean 2nd, where the second Star Ocean game is coming out.

1275
01:27:09,594 --> 01:27:14,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Resistance Reptribution, LocoRoco 2, Poptapon 2.

1276
01:27:16,016 --> 01:27:19,257
[SPEAKER_05]: There's supposedly a Motorstorm game and a little Big Planet game coming.

1277
01:27:19,277 --> 01:27:23,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think of what else.

1278
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:26,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Monochemia is coming out on PSP.

1279
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's Africa PSP?

1280
01:27:29,668 --> 01:27:31,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's Africa PS3?

1281
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:33,272
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, wasn't that supposed to be out by now?

1282
01:27:33,512 --> 01:27:51,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they were picking up a National Geographic license I was this close to importing it And I was like, fuck that, I can't run over the animals So I said, no, I'm not buying that Uh, Dissida, when it comes out in English Yes, Dissida will be coming out over here in the summer Okay God, I can't wait to play that Um

1283
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:58,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it looks like a better year, definitely, because 2008 sucked.

1284
01:27:58,203 --> 01:28:01,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, you look at the releases, there was just not a lot of releases, period.

1285
01:28:02,184 --> 01:28:03,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there were some good ones.

1286
01:28:03,324 --> 01:28:05,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the Midnight Club LA remix is supposed to be pretty good.

1287
01:28:05,924 --> 01:28:09,905
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Star Ocean, the first one, was pretty good.

1288
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:15,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I could go for some more of the Final Fantasy ports to the PSP.

1289
01:28:15,966 --> 01:28:17,887
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be pretty awesome, like, you know, maybe six.

1290
01:28:20,727 --> 01:28:23,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we get all the questions in that email?

1291
01:28:23,848 --> 01:28:24,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we did.

1292
01:28:24,709 --> 01:28:25,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't doubt.

1293
01:28:25,569 --> 01:28:27,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1294
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:29,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did.

1295
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:33,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to the next email.

1296
01:28:34,913 --> 01:28:41,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought I would update you folks as to what's going on regarding the situation with my stolen PS3.

1297
01:28:41,835 --> 01:28:43,136
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Spazinator.

1298
01:28:43,156 --> 01:28:43,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator.

1299
01:28:44,116 --> 01:28:53,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, he called in last week or the week before to mention that it got stolen, and he wanted us to kind of put out the word for all our fans in Buffalo, of which I don't know how many we have, but we tried.

1300
01:28:54,093 --> 01:29:01,437
[SPEAKER_02]: To date, the Buffalo Police have not done anything about it, and let's face it, unless the PS3 was jelly-filled or covered in sprinkles, they aren't likely to look for it.

1301
01:29:01,517 --> 01:29:02,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Frankly, I have no faith in them.

1302
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:07,499
[SPEAKER_02]: My counseling agency has been helpful as a wet fart.

1303
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Read, not at all.

1304
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:17,184
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd think that since the theft occurred there that they'd be eager to have this issue resolved just to cover their collective asses, but it looks like that isn't the case.

1305
01:29:17,864 --> 01:29:17,944
[SPEAKER_02]: As...

1306
01:29:19,765 --> 01:29:20,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost my place, actually.

1307
01:29:21,206 --> 01:29:31,629
[SPEAKER_02]: As a related note, and if I neither mentioned it in the call or you haven't figured it out already, I brought my PS3 to my counseling agency for an informal party.

1308
01:29:32,089 --> 01:29:38,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supplying the entertainment, movies downloaded on PSN, karaoke, rock band, slash guitar hero, world tour style, etc.

1309
01:29:38,991 --> 01:29:39,791
[SPEAKER_02]: It was stolen between 12.15 p.m.

1310
01:29:39,811 --> 01:29:39,971
[SPEAKER_02]: and 1.15 p.m.

1311
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:40,151
[SPEAKER_02]: EST.

1312
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:41,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be a.m.? ?

1313
01:29:47,617 --> 01:29:51,619
[SPEAKER_02]: on AST on 11.19 when it was unattended.

1314
01:29:52,099 --> 01:29:55,320
[SPEAKER_02]: In all likelihood, I won't be getting my original system back, which is a shame.

1315
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:58,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the 60GB model, which are impossible to find.

1316
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:05,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, but I upgraded the internal HDD and bought a ton of stuff off of the PSN store.

1317
01:30:06,264 --> 01:30:20,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, luckily my SSI PAE is sitting on my rainy day fund and sent her a request for the adequate funds to replace the system with a used 80GB model and the same type of upgraded HDD that I had before.

1318
01:30:20,775 --> 01:30:24,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll worry about the movies and TV shows that I bought at a later time and date.

1319
01:30:24,678 --> 01:30:25,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the long as hell email.

1320
01:30:26,019 --> 01:30:26,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, it's not.

1321
01:30:27,299 --> 01:30:29,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figured that you'd appreciate an update.

1322
01:30:29,421 --> 01:30:29,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1323
01:30:30,982 --> 01:30:32,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for letting us know.

1324
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:39,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, stolen systems suck, and whoever stole your system needs to die in a fire, and let's just hope that karma comes around and bites this person in their big fat ass.

1325
01:30:42,072 --> 01:30:42,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1326
01:30:43,243 --> 01:30:43,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email!

1327
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:13,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's gaming related, but I would like a new computer.

1328
01:31:13,822 --> 01:31:18,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a new computer for the gaming, but I would just like a whole new setup for the show.

1329
01:31:18,584 --> 01:31:26,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like a fancy new mix board, an easier way to publish a show on a faster computer without having to transfer it to my new one, which has kind of been slowing things down.

1330
01:31:26,687 --> 01:31:28,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's technically gaming related.

1331
01:31:28,747 --> 01:31:30,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, because it has to do with the show.

1332
01:31:30,768 --> 01:31:32,169
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be my thing.

1333
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:36,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd want a fancy, I want a state-of-the-art computer recording studio.

1334
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:37,311
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want.

1335
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:38,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1336
01:31:41,108 --> 01:31:44,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a DDRX machine.

1337
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:46,371
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty pricey.

1338
01:31:46,631 --> 01:31:46,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1339
01:31:47,171 --> 01:31:47,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And new.

1340
01:31:49,653 --> 01:31:50,133
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

1341
01:31:51,614 --> 01:31:51,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1342
01:31:52,395 --> 01:31:56,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say that there's too much that I would really want that I don't already have.

1343
01:31:57,858 --> 01:32:06,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually want a PC Engine Duo RX and an arcade card so that I can play Sapphire.

1344
01:32:08,826 --> 01:32:11,048
[SPEAKER_04]: and I want a baby Pac-Man machine.

1345
01:32:11,829 --> 01:32:13,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yes!

1346
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:14,731
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1347
01:32:14,751 --> 01:32:15,612
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell with the studio.

1348
01:32:15,652 --> 01:32:17,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Just bring me a baby Pac-Man machine.

1349
01:32:17,093 --> 01:32:17,433
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1350
01:32:17,493 --> 01:32:19,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have the pinball machine that I really want.

1351
01:32:19,915 --> 01:32:21,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my World Cup soccer.

1352
01:32:22,297 --> 01:32:25,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you believe that Dan actually asked me if I would trade it temporarily?

1353
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I can't go on a completely random tangent for a minute.

1354
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:29,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.

1355
01:32:29,403 --> 01:32:30,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's the thing.

1356
01:32:31,204 --> 01:32:31,944
[SPEAKER_04]: It is related, though.

1357
01:32:33,325 --> 01:32:36,387
[SPEAKER_04]: On Twitter, I follow some other podcasters, some other indie podcasters.

1358
01:32:36,427 --> 01:32:39,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the podcasters I follow is one of the guys from Video Game Outsiders.

1359
01:32:39,829 --> 01:32:41,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And he posted to YouTube today.

1360
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:45,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he picked up some new Popeye machine or something.

1361
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:51,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess what he does, he has, like how you amass a bunch of pinball machines in your house, he amasses a bunch of 80s stuff in his basement.

1362
01:32:51,918 --> 01:32:53,439
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of babies in his basement.

1363
01:32:53,499 --> 01:32:54,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a bunch of babies.

1364
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this baby at the mall.

1365
01:32:59,641 --> 01:33:02,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take it home and raise it to do my work.

1366
01:33:02,402 --> 01:33:04,643
[SPEAKER_04]: No, stop trying to start a podcast war.

1367
01:33:04,663 --> 01:33:05,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just see it now.

1368
01:33:05,844 --> 01:33:08,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see they're going to read an email on the show.

1369
01:33:08,604 --> 01:33:11,846
[SPEAKER_06]: The guys from OLR said that you have babies in your basement.

1370
01:33:13,426 --> 01:33:14,687
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you have to say about that?

1371
01:33:14,987 --> 01:33:15,687
[SPEAKER_04]: They're crunchy.

1372
01:33:18,123 --> 01:33:18,944
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1373
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:42,724
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have to admit, it's the first time I've ever really watched something like that another podcaster did where I was completely overcome with jealousy.

1374
01:33:43,365 --> 01:33:44,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just total jealousy.

1375
01:33:44,765 --> 01:33:47,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at it going, that is so cool.

1376
01:33:47,507 --> 01:33:49,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so fucking jealous.

1377
01:33:49,147 --> 01:33:51,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one of those fuckers so badly.

1378
01:33:51,469 --> 01:33:53,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the baby Pac-Man sort of sucks ass.

1379
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:55,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the novelty.

1380
01:33:56,071 --> 01:33:57,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the novelty of the whole thing.

1381
01:33:57,251 --> 01:34:01,994
[SPEAKER_02]: The only successful incarnation of video and pinball has been Pinball 2000.

1382
01:34:04,045 --> 01:34:04,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1383
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:06,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

1384
01:34:07,146 --> 01:34:09,086
[SPEAKER_04]: God, now they're going to get... I can just see it now.

1385
01:34:09,346 --> 01:34:10,806
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you keep babies in your basement.

1386
01:34:10,846 --> 01:34:16,008
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's Baby Pac-Man that he had in his basement that I was completely and utterly overcome with jealousy.

1387
01:34:16,428 --> 01:34:17,248
[SPEAKER_02]: He had babies.

1388
01:34:18,148 --> 01:34:21,129
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could find one of those machines cheap, you know I would put that shit in this garage.

1389
01:34:21,149 --> 01:34:22,229
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't find one cheap.

1390
01:34:22,649 --> 01:34:22,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1391
01:34:22,909 --> 01:34:24,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's completely destroyed and gutted.

1392
01:34:24,889 --> 01:34:25,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1393
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:26,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Last email.

1394
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:29,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan, come fix my Baby Pac-Man.

1395
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:31,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know dick about pinball games.

1396
01:34:32,972 --> 01:34:33,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR!

1397
01:34:59,224 --> 01:35:01,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Without much lag while I was there.

1398
01:35:01,585 --> 01:35:04,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got home and started playing for a few hours, so my question is for Sky.

1399
01:35:05,207 --> 01:35:09,169
[SPEAKER_02]: What server, or whatever it is it's called, do you play on?

1400
01:35:09,289 --> 01:35:12,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I play on the Garethos, did I spell that right?

1401
01:35:12,931 --> 01:35:13,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Server.

1402
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:18,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm level 9, and I wanted to know if it's worth buying and if I can switch server to play on with you.

1403
01:35:18,733 --> 01:35:22,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, tell me a little about the game and some of the things that will convince me to buy it.

1404
01:35:24,102 --> 01:35:25,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give you an answer you weren't expecting.

1405
01:35:25,903 --> 01:35:30,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if I remember right, Cheeseburger is like 15 years old, 14, 15, like he's a younger listener of ours.

1406
01:35:31,124 --> 01:35:35,146
[SPEAKER_04]: My advice to you is not to buy World of Warcraft because you're still in school.

1407
01:35:35,566 --> 01:35:38,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you get sucked into a game like World of Warcraft, it could affect your school.

1408
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:39,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

1409
01:35:40,048 --> 01:35:48,070
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know in your heart and in your gut and in your mind that you can restrict yourself to playing this game one or two hours a day tops, then it might be okay.

1410
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:49,831
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, it's the social element.

1411
01:35:50,171 --> 01:35:51,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what really these games are all about.

1412
01:35:51,952 --> 01:35:56,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I could describe all about the quests and the classes and the magic and all this stuff, but you know what?

1413
01:35:56,195 --> 01:35:56,955
[SPEAKER_04]: You're playing the game.

1414
01:35:56,995 --> 01:35:58,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You see all that firsthand.

1415
01:35:58,496 --> 01:36:03,319
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why people get addicted to this stuff is the social element.

1416
01:36:03,599 --> 01:36:07,222
[SPEAKER_04]: When I log on to the game and I say hello to the guild, everybody goes, Rob!

1417
01:36:07,622 --> 01:36:10,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like walking into Cheers, the bar, and everybody yells, Norm!

1418
01:36:11,504 --> 01:36:12,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that kind of thing.

1419
01:36:12,505 --> 01:36:15,547
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the reward that you're going to get out of a game like Warcraft.

1420
01:36:16,327 --> 01:36:16,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That being said...

1421
01:36:17,808 --> 01:36:18,689
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1422
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:37,858
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my honest advice.

1423
01:36:37,878 --> 01:36:37,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Ta-da!

1424
01:36:37,998 --> 01:36:39,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was it for emails?

1425
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:06,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that, didn't I?

1426
01:37:07,088 --> 01:37:07,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wasn't listening.

1427
01:37:08,249 --> 01:37:08,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise.

1428
01:37:08,629 --> 01:37:09,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, gee, Rob.

1429
01:37:09,769 --> 01:37:10,350
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is new?

1430
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:11,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't listen to this show.

1431
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:13,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I just talk on it.

1432
01:37:13,652 --> 01:37:14,012
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1433
01:37:14,112 --> 01:37:14,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for emails.

1434
01:37:14,872 --> 01:37:17,994
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1435
01:37:18,034 --> 01:37:21,296
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get some more stuff from you later during the Skype line.

1436
01:37:22,695 --> 01:37:25,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how long we can go tonight because it's fucking freezing out here in the garage.

1437
01:37:25,516 --> 01:37:27,277
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will get some more stories first.

1438
01:37:27,297 --> 01:37:28,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as cold as it was last week.

1439
01:37:28,777 --> 01:37:29,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still pretty fucking cold.

1440
01:37:31,018 --> 01:37:31,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this quilt.

1441
01:37:32,419 --> 01:37:32,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so cold.

1442
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:33,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki.

1443
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:39,922
[SPEAKER_05]: There's rumors that the PSP is getting another revision.

1444
01:37:40,462 --> 01:37:44,143
[SPEAKER_05]: The PSP 4000 is apparently due out late 2009.

1445
01:37:44,763 --> 01:37:48,525
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming to us from Eurogamer that reports their publishing sources.

1446
01:37:49,065 --> 01:37:50,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony is planning to launch a PSP2

1447
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Where have I heard we have no plans for something before?

1448
01:38:17,862 --> 01:38:18,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know!

1449
01:38:18,603 --> 01:38:21,304
[SPEAKER_05]: On every other rumor that they have no plans on.

1450
01:38:21,325 --> 01:38:22,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, no plans for a price cut.

1451
01:38:23,026 --> 01:38:25,608
[SPEAKER_05]: No plans on releasing a 160GB system.

1452
01:38:26,088 --> 01:38:29,010
[SPEAKER_05]: No plans for doing something that's completely obvious.

1453
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:30,711
[SPEAKER_05]: No plans to release a good system.

1454
01:38:32,232 --> 01:38:35,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no plans on ever becoming the number one console.

1455
01:38:36,495 --> 01:38:36,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Again.

1456
01:38:37,956 --> 01:38:39,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So, when you hear no plans...

1457
01:38:40,675 --> 01:38:42,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Hear them saying, it's like we are.

1458
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:47,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, just big deal.

1459
01:38:47,765 --> 01:38:49,447
[SPEAKER_05]: We know hardware revision's coming.

1460
01:38:50,008 --> 01:38:50,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a big surprise.

1461
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:54,914
[SPEAKER_04]: A sequel to a popular handheld system might happen, you think?

1462
01:38:55,615 --> 01:38:56,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1463
01:38:56,136 --> 01:38:57,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

1464
01:38:58,669 --> 01:39:06,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, moving on over to Nintendo, who has been number one lately, although amongst the hardcore gamers, some of us are starting to feel a little jaded.

1465
01:39:06,615 --> 01:39:11,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, this is something that some hardcore gamers will be into, but probably more for the casual crowd and the young folks.

1466
01:39:12,839 --> 01:39:19,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the early 2009 releases for Nintendo, of course, headlined by Pokemon Platinum on March 22nd.

1467
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:25,528
[SPEAKER_04]: That is going to be a pretty big title on the Nintendo DS, even though, isn't it just the last two Pokemon?

1468
01:39:25,768 --> 01:39:26,749
[SPEAKER_04]: They do this all the time.

1469
01:39:26,789 --> 01:39:26,869
[SPEAKER_04]: They

1470
01:39:26,869 --> 01:39:27,209
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1471
01:39:42,943 --> 01:39:44,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other games that are coming out.

1472
01:39:44,524 --> 01:39:49,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echo of Time is supposed to actually come out this spring, so we'll see what happens with that.

1473
01:39:51,348 --> 01:39:53,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, what else is supposed to come out here?

1474
01:39:53,149 --> 01:39:54,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a whole list.

1475
01:39:56,891 --> 01:39:59,052
[SPEAKER_04]: That is spring that they said that game would come out.

1476
01:39:59,453 --> 01:39:59,953
[SPEAKER_04]: March?

1477
01:40:00,553 --> 01:40:02,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, probably the later the better.

1478
01:40:03,735 --> 01:40:04,856
[SPEAKER_04]: For them, not for me.

1479
01:40:04,876 --> 01:40:08,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest V. Is that on...

1480
01:40:09,673 --> 01:40:14,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Saga's Putting Out the House of the Dead Overkill on Wii in February Sonic and the Black Knight in March Mad World in March

1481
01:40:27,408 --> 01:40:31,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Ubisoft's got Tenchu in February and Broken Sword, Shadows of the Templars in March.

1482
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:38,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo, first party games, the only stuff they're putting out, Mario Power Tennis in March and Pikmin in March.

1483
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:38,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1484
01:40:39,058 --> 01:40:39,659
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Wii, yeah.

1485
01:40:39,819 --> 01:40:40,219
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Wii.

1486
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:52,470
[SPEAKER_04]: However, on the DS from Nintendo, Personal Trainer Math on January 12th, Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon on February 16th, and the before-mentioned Pokemon Platinum, which is kind of in line with their one title a month.

1487
01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:53,550
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1488
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:20,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Ubisoft, Imagine Cheerleader, Imagine Family Doctor, Imagine Ice Champions, American Popstar, Road to Celebrity Cash Cow Pikmin

1489
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:39,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to point out, Konami is putting out a game on the Wii that some of you guys might care about.

1490
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:41,262
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Disney Grooves.

1491
01:41:42,163 --> 01:41:44,185
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that are still playing DDR after all these years.

1492
01:41:44,245 --> 01:41:44,605
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1493
01:41:47,247 --> 01:41:51,491
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Factor 5 goes down, but Sonic Team is still around.

1494
01:41:51,571 --> 01:41:52,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the justice?

1495
01:41:53,072 --> 01:41:53,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the justice?

1496
01:41:56,675 --> 01:41:59,037
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that for first quarter lineup.

1497
01:41:59,498 --> 01:41:59,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1498
01:42:00,313 --> 01:42:05,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about something very cool for all of our 8-bit fans?

1499
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, thank you for the old-school Nintendo Entertainment System, DarkSakura.

1500
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:12,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a second Christmas gift slash late birthday gift.

1501
01:42:12,746 --> 01:42:19,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also, thanks, Sauce, for agreeing to a trade that I got the better end of the deal of.

1502
01:42:20,353 --> 01:42:23,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at a video here on this site.

1503
01:42:23,576 --> 01:42:25,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that's what you're hearing in the background. ...

1504
01:42:54,539 --> 01:43:01,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it seems like it's a hacked ROM of some sort, because the music in the background is strange.

1505
01:43:01,464 --> 01:43:02,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1506
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't sound like Pac-Man at all.

1507
01:43:04,066 --> 01:43:05,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, there you go.

1508
01:43:05,106 --> 01:43:06,047
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it sounds like.

1509
01:43:06,407 --> 01:43:09,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be trying to emulate the music from... Hmm, maybe.

1510
01:43:09,589 --> 01:43:17,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at any rate, there's no idea where you can find the ROM.

1511
01:43:17,635 --> 01:43:19,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from the Pac-Mania soundtrack.

1512
01:43:19,896 --> 01:43:20,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is it?

1513
01:43:20,316 --> 01:43:20,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1514
01:43:20,937 --> 01:43:20,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1515
01:43:21,744 --> 01:43:22,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry if that was loud, guys.

1516
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:29,890
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't loud to us in the studio, but I guess it came out very loud over the... But hey, whoever finds it, then let me know what you think of it.

1517
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:30,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So, cool.

1518
01:43:31,752 --> 01:43:38,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, apparently the weird thing about this is that it's still unknown if this is like real or a concept thing, because no ROM has showed up out there.

1519
01:43:40,678 --> 01:43:41,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1520
01:43:41,839 --> 01:43:42,760
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the weird thing about it.

1521
01:43:43,381 --> 01:43:50,026
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something you can actually download for use in an emulator, but they say it's an actual 8-bit Nintendo game.

1522
01:43:50,757 --> 01:43:51,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1523
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:59,939
[SPEAKER_05]: A game that is coming out on the DS, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, has been dated for March.

1524
01:43:59,959 --> 01:44:05,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is weird because I thought it was dated before for January, but either way, it's coming out now March 17th.

1525
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:11,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars will feature most of Liberty City.

1526
01:44:12,401 --> 01:44:16,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're cutting out Alderney from Grand Theft Auto 4, but most of it.

1527
01:44:16,942 --> 01:44:18,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to kind of look a little bit like...

1528
01:44:20,183 --> 01:44:21,905
[SPEAKER_05]: The old Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 games.

1529
01:44:21,925 --> 01:44:25,247
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, kind of a top-down 3D type of game.

1530
01:44:25,728 --> 01:44:26,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all cel-shaded.

1531
01:44:27,429 --> 01:44:30,192
[SPEAKER_05]: But still violent and pretty cool looking.

1532
01:44:31,873 --> 01:44:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay cool looking things.

1533
01:44:33,775 --> 01:44:36,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe will be getting the game three days later on March 20th.

1534
01:44:37,057 --> 01:44:39,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good that it's not getting delayed so bad.

1535
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:39,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1536
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't wait to try the online multiplayer.

1537
01:44:42,762 --> 01:44:43,222
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be fun.

1538
01:44:44,203 --> 01:44:46,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, tons of people will be cheating in it because they can.

1539
01:44:47,066 --> 01:44:47,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.

1540
01:44:49,423 --> 01:44:52,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here's something interesting going on.

1541
01:44:52,604 --> 01:44:55,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the hell you want to call this, but I don't know if you've heard about this project.

1542
01:44:55,846 --> 01:45:02,488
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Bob's Game, and it's this guy who's spent a lot, a lot of time making a particular DS homebrew project.

1543
01:45:02,908 --> 01:45:04,549
[SPEAKER_04]: He's apparently going on protest.

1544
01:45:04,589 --> 01:45:12,072
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to be spending 100 days locked in his room, locked and barricaded from the outside to protest how Nintendo has been treating his project.

1545
01:45:13,697 --> 01:45:14,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

1546
01:45:14,598 --> 01:45:22,483
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs a DS software development kit to get his game, which is... I guess what Bob made is some type of 2D adventure thing.

1547
01:45:22,543 --> 01:45:23,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks really cool.

1548
01:45:23,444 --> 01:45:26,886
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually wants to sell it as a retail game, but Nintendo will not give him one.

1549
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:37,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though Bob has apparently talked to Nintendo, done the application, told he was going to get an answer in a few months, and apparently 17 weeks have gone by, no answer, no kit has showed up.

1550
01:45:37,293 --> 01:45:41,636
[SPEAKER_04]: However, now what he's going to be planning is this 100-day sit-down protest.

1551
01:45:41,916 --> 01:45:42,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's doing a tantrum.

1552
01:45:43,342 --> 01:45:44,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, he's throwing a fit.

1553
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:46,363
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1554
01:46:15,304 --> 01:46:18,226
[SPEAKER_04]: On the application, it said it would be six to eight weeks for a decision.

1555
01:46:18,266 --> 01:46:19,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been 17.

1556
01:46:19,566 --> 01:46:21,087
[SPEAKER_04]: He says he's met all the requirements.

1557
01:46:21,127 --> 01:46:28,170
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a financially stable registered company with an FEIN, which I believe is a federal identification number, working from a commercial address.

1558
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:33,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says that when Nintendo decides to approve the developer license, he will end his protest.

1559
01:46:33,652 --> 01:46:35,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, you can actually watch on live webcam.

1560
01:46:36,233 --> 01:46:37,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to go to the site right now.

1561
01:46:37,534 --> 01:46:39,055
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like he's asleep.

1562
01:46:39,515 --> 01:46:41,036
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see something on the board right now.

1563
01:46:41,056 --> 01:46:42,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It says Reggie on the monitor there.

1564
01:46:43,357 --> 01:46:43,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1565
01:46:46,063 --> 01:46:49,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually his live confinement right now, but it looks like he's fast asleep or something.

1566
01:46:49,909 --> 01:46:50,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Or he left the room.

1567
01:46:51,172 --> 01:46:51,753
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's on day 12.

1568
01:46:51,813 --> 01:46:55,118
[SPEAKER_02]: How can he leave the room if he's not supposed to leave the room?

1569
01:46:55,279 --> 01:46:57,342
[SPEAKER_05]: It says he sleeps behind the camera.

1570
01:46:58,043 --> 01:46:58,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1571
01:46:59,656 --> 01:47:00,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's his potty?

1572
01:47:01,337 --> 01:47:03,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that's all behind the camera too or something.

1573
01:47:03,658 --> 01:47:06,019
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, he says he cannot leave the room.

1574
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:08,040
[SPEAKER_04]: The door is locked and barricaded from the outside.

1575
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:09,741
[SPEAKER_04]: He's sleeping behind the camera.

1576
01:47:09,821 --> 01:47:10,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there is a shower.

1577
01:47:11,142 --> 01:47:13,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Food is being delivered once a week by a friend.

1578
01:47:13,203 --> 01:47:17,545
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no internet access, television, or game consoles besides the ones he's developing on.

1579
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:22,927
[SPEAKER_04]: He can receive and send email on his cell phone so he can get Nintendo's reply and update the site.

1580
01:47:23,408 --> 01:47:25,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And the LED counter will be incremented once a day.

1581
01:47:26,069 --> 01:47:28,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it will display hints and secret messages.

1582
01:47:31,232 --> 01:47:33,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, Jamie, he's throwing a tantrum.

1583
01:47:35,434 --> 01:47:49,760
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing the equivalent of sticking his fingers in his ears and closing his eyes and going, Well, still though, what about the point that he's meeting all of Nintendo's requirements and Nintendo's dicking him?

1584
01:47:50,832 --> 01:47:51,453
[SPEAKER_04]: What about that?

1585
01:47:52,033 --> 01:47:53,134
[SPEAKER_04]: To play Devil's Advocate.

1586
01:47:53,154 --> 01:47:54,775
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more Imagine games.

1587
01:47:54,975 --> 01:47:57,036
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have time with this good adventure crap.

1588
01:47:57,337 --> 01:47:59,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Need more Imagine and more pets.

1589
01:47:59,138 --> 01:48:02,480
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's got Imagine and pets in it, we can definitely do something with it.

1590
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:03,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and if it's a sim.

1591
01:48:04,902 --> 01:48:05,782
[SPEAKER_04]: More sim games.

1592
01:48:06,303 --> 01:48:08,945
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob, you need to get an interview with this guy.

1593
01:48:09,005 --> 01:48:09,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I can.

1594
01:48:10,005 --> 01:48:11,066
[SPEAKER_04]: He has no phone, right?

1595
01:48:11,786 --> 01:48:12,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.

1596
01:48:12,107 --> 01:48:13,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, he has a cell phone.

1597
01:48:13,788 --> 01:48:14,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I can.

1598
01:48:14,368 --> 01:48:15,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I could try sending an email.

1599
01:48:15,629 --> 01:48:16,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1600
01:48:17,410 --> 01:48:19,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty in chat says, there's better ways to bitch about it.

1601
01:48:21,738 --> 01:48:23,960
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1602
01:48:50,151 --> 01:48:50,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

1603
01:48:51,232 --> 01:48:54,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so good luck, Bob, on your protest, I guess.

1604
01:48:54,496 --> 01:48:55,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't die.

1605
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:57,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.

1606
01:48:58,501 --> 01:49:01,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of fucking ridiculous.

1607
01:49:02,186 --> 01:49:03,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And by kind of, I mean really.

1608
01:49:05,942 --> 01:49:10,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is very, very happy, happy news for me.

1609
01:49:11,163 --> 01:49:16,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have been wanting this game, and I played the other two, and it's freaking beautiful.

1610
01:49:17,365 --> 01:49:21,326
[SPEAKER_02]: But Klonoa Door to Phantom Isle is going to be coming out in North America.

1611
01:49:22,106 --> 01:49:23,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes me giddy!

1612
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:26,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's supposed to be out in Spring 2009.

1613
01:49:28,976 --> 01:49:30,638
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1614
01:49:52,157 --> 01:49:55,539
[SPEAKER_02]: and the classic controller is also, you can use that too.

1615
01:49:56,259 --> 01:50:01,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a rumor that the Klonoa 2 remake is on its way.

1616
01:50:03,904 --> 01:50:10,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Klonoa 2 is freaking hard, but I really, really, really, really, really love Klonoa.

1617
01:50:11,168 --> 01:50:13,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this took so long to come out in the U.S.

1618
01:50:13,289 --> 01:50:17,812
[SPEAKER_04]: because the Klonoa developers locked themselves in a room for 100 days until Nintendo agreed to put out their game.

1619
01:50:21,636 --> 01:50:22,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1620
01:50:24,918 --> 01:50:39,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, after much begging and pleading, apparently EA has decided to graciously allow players to be able to reinstall their copies of Spore

1621
01:50:40,049 --> 01:50:40,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Hurray!

1622
01:51:00,424 --> 01:51:19,456
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately there's not a tool that's gotten me back interested in Spore again To which actually my cat knocked a disc on the floor in its case And I was like, eh, it's a good place for it Nice So do you let the cat rearrange all your furniture?

1623
01:51:20,036 --> 01:51:29,742
[SPEAKER_05]: She does that on her own She decides that she wants to cram herself in the tiny space that is between my monitor on the shelf And the top of my desk It's like...

1624
01:51:31,265 --> 01:51:32,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1625
01:51:41,172 --> 01:51:41,933
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your cat's name again?

1626
01:51:42,253 --> 01:51:42,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Stella.

1627
01:51:43,174 --> 01:51:43,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Stella.

1628
01:51:43,835 --> 01:51:44,215
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1629
01:51:45,377 --> 01:51:48,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, the RIAA.

1630
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:57,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently some kitties, some cute kittens went into the RIAA office and just they made them go aww and shucks because they decided to do something nice this holiday season.

1631
01:51:57,550 --> 01:52:02,936
[SPEAKER_04]: They are no longer going to sue individual file sharers or harass universities anymore.

1632
01:52:03,196 --> 01:52:03,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

1633
01:52:03,716 --> 01:52:04,397
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

1634
01:52:24,076 --> 01:52:28,959
[SPEAKER_04]: but they'll be able to better control the congestion on their networks by applying this new little policy.

1635
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:33,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Some words from Ars Technica on the original report of this.

1636
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:35,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Suddenly ISPs gained a tremendous new tool.

1637
01:52:35,863 --> 01:52:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: One study in the UK showed that most people sharing music would stop when made aware that their activity was being tracked and that they were not in fact anonymous.

1638
01:52:43,227 --> 01:52:47,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Should that hold true in the US, ISPs would presumably see massive decreases in P2P traffic.

1639
01:52:47,850 --> 01:52:48,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And whatever.

1640
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:50,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to work very well, but hey, you know, whatever.

1641
01:53:13,568 --> 01:53:14,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Pirate away, everybody!

1642
01:53:14,908 --> 01:53:16,089
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just kidding.

1643
01:53:16,409 --> 01:53:19,649
[SPEAKER_04]: You shouldn't pirate, because that's why all these people got laid off this week.

1644
01:53:20,889 --> 01:53:21,750
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all your fault.

1645
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:24,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the RAAs coming after you for music.

1646
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:29,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if there's any companies that are going to say, nope, we're not participating.

1647
01:53:29,391 --> 01:53:29,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Go fuck yourself.

1648
01:53:30,171 --> 01:53:32,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, stop downloading music and start downloading movies.

1649
01:53:33,852 --> 01:53:37,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Jrod in chat says, I got a letter from my ISP about downloading HBO shows.

1650
01:53:37,393 --> 01:53:38,313
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't stop my torrenting.

1651
01:53:41,553 --> 01:53:45,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've never received any kind of cease and desist.

1652
01:53:45,774 --> 01:53:49,056
[SPEAKER_05]: The only letters I receive from my ICP is, we're raising your rates.

1653
01:53:50,156 --> 01:53:51,116
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, thanks.

1654
01:53:51,856 --> 01:53:54,977
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're downloading TV shows, I mean, they were on TV.

1655
01:53:56,038 --> 01:53:56,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

1656
01:53:58,539 --> 01:54:02,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some other very interesting news.

1657
01:54:02,422 --> 01:54:07,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move away a little bit from the RIAA bastards.

1658
01:54:09,466 --> 01:54:12,448
[SPEAKER_02]: EA and Steam have decided to make sweet love.

1659
01:54:14,642 --> 01:54:37,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be EA games that are available through Steam's service which is Mass Effect Need for Speed Undercover and Spore and the Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack FIFA Manager 09 and Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning So that's going to be hanging out there So they're getting steamy?

1660
01:54:38,407 --> 01:54:39,908
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting steamy.

1661
01:54:40,388 --> 01:54:45,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Also others slated for there is Mirror's Edge, Command & Conquer, Red Alert 3, and Dead Space.

1662
01:54:48,592 --> 01:54:53,035
[SPEAKER_04]: But not Mick's steamy or else the RIA might sue them for sharing ABC shows.

1663
01:54:54,495 --> 01:54:54,736
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1664
01:54:55,116 --> 01:54:55,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing, never mind.

1665
01:54:58,237 --> 01:54:59,718
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't get that joke, good for you.

1666
01:55:00,619 --> 01:55:02,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Who in this room doesn't watch TV?

1667
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:02,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's me.

1668
01:55:04,275 --> 01:55:05,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Even you watch some TV.

1669
01:55:05,836 --> 01:55:08,398
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't watch TV like on TV.

1670
01:55:08,939 --> 01:55:10,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch DVDs after the fact.

1671
01:55:11,001 --> 01:55:11,461
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1672
01:55:11,561 --> 01:55:15,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I will going to be watching a show as soon as it's got new episodes on.

1673
01:55:15,985 --> 01:55:16,505
[SPEAKER_02]: When it airs.

1674
01:55:17,005 --> 01:55:17,266
[SPEAKER_04]: See.

1675
01:55:17,766 --> 01:55:18,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is Supernatural.

1676
01:55:18,246 --> 01:55:18,947
[SPEAKER_02]: American Idol.

1677
01:55:19,207 --> 01:55:19,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Supernatural.

1678
01:55:21,409 --> 01:55:23,731
[SPEAKER_04]: What if there's David Cook 2 on American Idol next year?

1679
01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:24,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you watch that?

1680
01:55:27,294 --> 01:55:31,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind, I watched American Idol through YouTube.

1681
01:55:32,435 --> 01:55:39,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Well this year they're actually getting rid of or they're limiting the amount of the bad singers that they have on the show.

1682
01:55:40,804 --> 01:55:42,406
[SPEAKER_05]: To that I say, great!

1683
01:55:43,006 --> 01:55:44,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Another show I don't have to watch anymore.

1684
01:55:46,378 --> 01:55:55,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so apparently, you know, Crackdown 2 is a game that I wish would come out because Crackdown 1 was awesome and it does need a sequel.

1685
01:55:56,023 --> 01:56:03,387
[SPEAKER_05]: But, of course, you know, Real Time Worlds, they're busy working on the game that I'm going to have to get back into MMOs for and that would be APB.

1686
01:56:04,607 --> 01:56:08,049
[SPEAKER_05]: But until that happens, people still wish for Crackdown 2.

1687
01:56:08,769 --> 01:56:13,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there was a rumor that Crackdown 2 was actually being developed by another company, Ruffian Games.

1688
01:56:14,792 --> 01:56:17,354
[SPEAKER_05]: However, that may not be the case anymore.

1689
01:56:19,555 --> 01:56:32,102
[SPEAKER_05]: The studio head, Colin McDonald, actually said they would like to make the sequel for Crackdown, although to date they have not been offered from Microsoft for a Crackdown sequel.

1690
01:56:32,642 --> 01:56:41,307
[SPEAKER_05]: They are having ongoing discussions with them, and they would feel really hurt if Microsoft went to some other studio to develop it.

1691
01:56:43,614 --> 01:56:45,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there rumors that that's exactly what Microsoft did?

1692
01:56:46,916 --> 01:56:49,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was, but they don't know.

1693
01:56:50,239 --> 01:57:00,266
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that they would doubt that Microsoft would choose a startup on RTW's doorstep, Ruffian.

1694
01:57:01,167 --> 01:57:03,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why they would choose them, I guess.

1695
01:57:04,189 --> 01:57:05,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Jrod in chat says, Crackdown!

1696
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:07,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you meant that bonus disc that came with the Halo 3 beta?

1697
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:11,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's the one.

1698
01:57:12,123 --> 01:57:13,424
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is awesome, okay?

1699
01:57:13,585 --> 01:57:14,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1700
01:57:15,707 --> 01:57:17,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Way better than the Halo 3 beta.

1701
01:57:17,790 --> 01:57:18,311
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't bad.

1702
01:57:18,511 --> 01:57:20,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't bad.

1703
01:57:20,694 --> 01:57:24,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, in reality, I probably did play more Crackdown than I did Halo 3, and I didn't even know the game.

1704
01:57:24,559 --> 01:57:25,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Crackdown was awesome.

1705
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:26,541
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crack.

1706
01:57:27,322 --> 01:57:27,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Down.

1707
01:57:27,903 --> 01:57:28,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Down.

1708
01:57:29,799 --> 01:57:30,659
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1709
01:57:53,630 --> 01:58:01,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it does, it makes all the sights and the sounds of a winter fireplace via your Xbox 360 on the television.

1710
01:58:01,933 --> 01:58:08,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one of those, like you remember the old cassette tapes that was just nothing but the fire that you could play in the background during Christmas?

1711
01:58:08,855 --> 01:58:10,276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically what this is.

1712
01:58:10,676 --> 01:58:10,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1713
01:58:11,416 --> 01:58:12,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you mean a videotape?

1714
01:58:12,537 --> 01:58:12,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1715
01:58:13,237 --> 01:58:14,317
[SPEAKER_04]: But what did they call it?

1716
01:58:14,357 --> 01:58:16,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a virtual Yule log or something like that?

1717
01:58:16,878 --> 01:58:17,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Virtual fireplace.

1718
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:18,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they call it.

1719
01:58:19,261 --> 01:58:23,343
[SPEAKER_05]: They still have those and they actually have Blu-rays now of virtual fireplaces.

1720
01:58:24,124 --> 01:58:25,404
[SPEAKER_04]: People buy this shit.

1721
01:58:25,444 --> 01:58:26,445
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the amazing thing.

1722
01:58:27,345 --> 01:58:32,248
[SPEAKER_04]: We should make the official OLR Yule log and just make tons and tons of money off people's...

1723
01:58:33,777 --> 01:58:34,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Impulse Buys.

1724
01:58:34,618 --> 01:58:34,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1725
01:58:35,098 --> 01:58:35,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of crazy.

1726
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:42,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently you can get the demo on your Xbox 360 and you can even get that on the internet.

1727
01:58:42,404 --> 01:58:44,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Just download it right away and you can get a little four minute demo.

1728
01:58:44,986 --> 01:58:46,107
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

1729
01:58:46,447 --> 01:58:49,169
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want the full version, it's 400 points.

1730
01:58:50,970 --> 01:58:51,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm

1731
01:58:52,543 --> 01:59:05,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to give this guy a lot of shit because having talked to Aaron on a previous show who made Snake360 and talking to the community developers, I think there's a certain range of points that they can charge.

1732
01:59:05,688 --> 01:59:09,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And so probably 400 is all this guy can charge.

1733
01:59:09,289 --> 01:59:10,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he can charge less.

1734
01:59:11,670 --> 01:59:13,290
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

1735
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:13,290
200.

1736
01:59:13,610 --> 01:59:14,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Bastard.

1737
01:59:15,751 --> 01:59:16,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1738
01:59:16,071 --> 01:59:16,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1739
01:59:16,351 --> 01:59:18,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to look at some video of this thing in action here.

1740
01:59:18,332 --> 01:59:18,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1741
01:59:18,652 --> 01:59:20,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to actually play a little video.

1742
01:59:23,723 --> 01:59:27,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, that is definitely a virtual log.

1743
01:59:27,925 --> 01:59:31,527
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, you could probably purchase a DVD for cheaper.

1744
01:59:33,748 --> 01:59:34,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Than five bucks?

1745
01:59:34,989 --> 01:59:37,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you could probably go to the 99 cent store and get one of these DVDs.

1746
01:59:37,730 --> 01:59:42,072
[SPEAKER_05]: The 99 cent store has some pretty funny movies there.

1747
01:59:42,532 --> 01:59:46,874
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, that would be really fun to make stocking stuffers with the 99 cent clearance center movies.

1748
01:59:47,215 --> 01:59:47,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1749
01:59:48,496 --> 01:59:49,997
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some absolute crap.

1750
01:59:50,037 --> 01:59:50,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

1751
01:59:52,199 --> 01:59:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even press a button.

1752
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:59,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be awesome if you pressed a button and you could throw a kitten in the fire and watch what happens.

1753
02:00:00,246 --> 02:00:00,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1754
02:00:00,927 --> 02:00:02,628
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it is wrong, but funny.

1755
02:00:02,928 --> 02:00:03,609
[SPEAKER_05]: A reindeer.

1756
02:00:03,689 --> 02:00:04,690
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more festive.

1757
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:05,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Santa.

1758
02:00:05,971 --> 02:00:08,253
[SPEAKER_04]: You just watch Santa drop in the chimney into the fire.

1759
02:00:09,113 --> 02:00:11,896
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that would be worth 400 points.

1760
02:00:12,016 --> 02:00:13,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Christmas lemmings.

1761
02:00:14,418 --> 02:00:16,760
[SPEAKER_04]: As DarkTetsuyinChat says, or a ferret.

1762
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:20,561
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some new patches for some PC games.

1763
02:00:20,581 --> 02:00:22,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Far Cry 2 got a patch to fix their widescreen issues.

1764
02:00:22,361 --> 02:00:24,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it had the same thing that was wrong with Bioshock.

1765
02:00:47,608 --> 02:00:48,388
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1766
02:01:17,484 --> 02:01:20,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony declares death to the clamshell Slow going

1767
02:01:35,131 --> 02:01:36,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is Christmas week, for heaven's sake.

1768
02:01:36,732 --> 02:01:38,354
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, or well, you know, coming up.

1769
02:01:38,774 --> 02:01:44,458
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am so excited about the clamshell news, because I think that packaging is horrible, evil stuff.

1770
02:01:45,339 --> 02:01:46,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, grr.

1771
02:01:47,881 --> 02:01:49,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Clamshell packaging can go die in a fire.

1772
02:01:49,362 --> 02:01:50,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited to hear.

1773
02:01:50,463 --> 02:01:56,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to press a button and watch all my old clamshell packaging get burned in the fire, because that annoys me.

1774
02:01:56,834 --> 02:01:57,714
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're taking your calls.

1775
02:01:57,734 --> 02:02:02,855
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1776
02:02:03,415 --> 02:02:04,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing this a little bit too long.

1777
02:02:05,476 --> 02:02:07,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you believe next week is our last show of 2008?

1778
02:02:07,656 --> 02:02:13,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we will go into the year 2009, which would be our seventh year of podcasting, if you can believe it.

1779
02:02:14,758 --> 02:02:16,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Or seventh year of doing this show.

1780
02:02:16,178 --> 02:02:18,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess podcasting hasn't been around seven years, but you know what I mean.

1781
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:19,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy stuff.

1782
02:02:20,559 --> 02:02:21,139
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting old.

1783
02:02:23,366 --> 02:02:25,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year, one of us will kill another live on air.

1784
02:02:26,027 --> 02:02:27,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait for it.

1785
02:02:27,488 --> 02:02:28,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.

1786
02:02:29,748 --> 02:02:35,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you spend $5 for a Yule Log game on the 360 where you could throw clamshell packages into the fire?

1787
02:02:36,091 --> 02:02:36,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I might.

1788
02:02:37,331 --> 02:02:39,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I just might be willing to spend that kind of money.

1789
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:42,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Except you wouldn't because you'd have to use the D-pad to do that.

1790
02:02:42,653 --> 02:02:45,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm going to the chat.

1791
02:02:45,834 --> 02:02:46,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, the phone.

1792
02:02:47,294 --> 02:02:49,815
[SPEAKER_04]: That's getting late and I haven't even cracked open the eggnog yet.

1793
02:02:50,135 --> 02:02:51,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

1794
02:02:51,176 --> 02:02:51,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1795
02:02:52,418 --> 02:02:55,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku Hey Legend of Zaku, what's up?

1796
02:02:56,941 --> 02:02:59,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing much, you know today's my birthday, right?

1797
02:02:59,303 --> 02:03:04,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Or for the next, um, less than 40 minutes Well, happy Hanukkah!

1798
02:03:05,587 --> 02:03:21,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And birthday Not Jewish That's alright You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate Hanukkah I get guilt I love those potato latkes though Hell yeah, one of my friends was supposed to make me some of those, that sounds delish

1799
02:03:23,335 --> 02:03:24,156
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Zaku?

1800
02:03:43,042 --> 02:03:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing but just trying to scurry up as much money as possible to get me something, at least one game for Christmas since the last game I bought was GTA 4 back in May, like April or May.

1801
02:03:56,608 --> 02:03:57,349
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while.

1802
02:03:57,369 --> 02:03:59,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm unemployed right now.

1803
02:03:59,650 --> 02:04:07,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to find work and I can't be pissing my money away on unnecessary things like that when the bills have to be paid first and foremost.

1804
02:04:07,693 --> 02:04:09,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that Prince of Persia dropped in price to $40.

1805
02:04:09,754 --> 02:04:10,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Where at?

1806
02:04:12,395 --> 02:04:12,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Everywhere?

1807
02:04:14,296 --> 02:04:15,776
[SPEAKER_03]: What, for the PC or 360?

1808
02:04:15,937 --> 02:04:18,438
[SPEAKER_05]: No, for PS3 and Xbox 360.

1809
02:04:19,638 --> 02:04:22,139
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm trying to give my PC some love.

1810
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:25,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask, what one game are you thinking of buying?

1811
02:04:25,821 --> 02:04:27,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you must have something in mind.

1812
02:04:27,661 --> 02:04:28,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Left 4 Dead.

1813
02:04:28,902 --> 02:04:29,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Left 4 Dead.

1814
02:04:29,662 --> 02:04:30,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Why Left 4 Dead?

1815
02:04:31,683 --> 02:04:40,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because that's just like playing Half-Life with zombies, but with at least a subpar storyline with it.

1816
02:04:42,150 --> 02:05:10,935
[SPEAKER_04]: and I get to use my keyboard and mouse nice very cool I've heard a lot of good things about Left 4 Dead but I think that's another one of those games that I won't probably actually get to check out until next year just because I'm playing so much other crap like WoW yeah well I'm sorry to hear about the financial tough times but you know I mean I have plenty of money saved up I'm not worried about you know the bills but you know I can't burn that money that quickly that money has to last me until I find work right no that's understandable

1817
02:05:12,367 --> 02:05:15,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, other companies are struggling.

1818
02:05:15,609 --> 02:05:20,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you already had about two or three companies going under in one week.

1819
02:05:20,874 --> 02:05:21,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Six.

1820
02:05:21,955 --> 02:05:23,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not necessarily going under, but doing layoffs.

1821
02:05:23,777 --> 02:05:26,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Six companies doing some type of closure or cutbacks this week.

1822
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:28,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Factor 5, and I think

1823
02:05:29,943 --> 02:05:42,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Free Radical went belly up Yeah, we reported on it, I don't know if you were here at the very beginning of the show, but we kicked off the show Factor 5, EA, Midway, Free Radical, Asper, and Turbine all did some type of closure or layoff this week

1824
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:45,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like someone's not having a Christmas party this year.

1825
02:05:46,081 --> 02:05:47,241
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and it sucks.

1826
02:05:48,062 --> 02:05:49,102
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really too bad.

1827
02:05:49,262 --> 02:05:49,922
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really too bad.

1828
02:05:49,962 --> 02:05:53,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you used to work in, like, cell phone games and stuff.

1829
02:05:53,503 --> 02:05:54,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

1830
02:05:54,844 --> 02:06:05,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And this time last year, I had a really nice Christmas party complete with, like, all-you-can-eat stuff, open bar, you know, Guitar Hero, SingStar right there on a nice big projection.

1831
02:06:06,928 --> 02:06:08,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you surprised by what's happened?

1832
02:06:09,129 --> 02:06:10,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's shitty all around.

1833
02:06:10,970 --> 02:06:11,910
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know...

1834
02:06:12,742 --> 02:06:13,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask anybody.

1835
02:06:13,522 --> 02:06:21,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you know at least three or four or five people that you know personally that are probably unemployed right now and are struggling to find work in this economy.

1836
02:06:22,864 --> 02:06:25,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have so many skills right now.

1837
02:06:26,865 --> 02:06:34,767
[SPEAKER_03]: My experience is that I'm trying my best to secure work, but it's a clusterfuck because I'm not the only one fighting for that same job.

1838
02:06:34,787 --> 02:06:40,528
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like hundreds upon thousands of other people fighting for that same position, especially here in New York.

1839
02:06:41,184 --> 02:06:42,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very, very tough out there right now.

1840
02:06:43,447 --> 02:06:44,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very tough.

1841
02:06:45,489 --> 02:06:56,981
[SPEAKER_03]: You're lucky you still have work, whereas I had to work as a contractor since early this year, since I got laid off from my full-time job.

1842
02:06:57,021 --> 02:07:00,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I was connected and I had resources, but they ran out over the summer.

1843
02:07:01,611 --> 02:07:03,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I'm thankful to have a job.

1844
02:07:03,932 --> 02:07:09,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I stopped bitching about the promotion I was supposed to get because a while ago they were trying to give me a promotion at work.

1845
02:07:10,195 --> 02:07:15,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And I stopped bitching about it for now because I realized that I should just be lucky to have a job right now, so I'm just going to shut up.

1846
02:07:16,318 --> 02:07:21,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better to have a job, better to be working than not be working at all like me right now.

1847
02:07:23,281 --> 02:07:26,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Zaku, best of luck in your search, maybe for your birthday.

1848
02:07:27,063 --> 02:07:27,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody will give you a new job.

1849
02:07:28,550 --> 02:07:32,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully if you want, you know, I could give you my resume, see what you could do with it.

1850
02:07:32,751 --> 02:07:40,652
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, I live out, you know, here in New York, so it wouldn't make any sense if I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off.

1851
02:07:40,732 --> 02:07:43,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, which unfortunately I don't think I have the money to do right now.

1852
02:07:43,913 --> 02:07:45,593
[SPEAKER_04]: What the crap happened there?

1853
02:07:45,694 --> 02:07:48,314
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, we got like bad echo and Skype.

1854
02:07:48,454 --> 02:07:49,274
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

1855
02:07:49,334 --> 02:07:50,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I think closed on me.

1856
02:07:51,675 --> 02:07:52,475
[SPEAKER_04]: That was weird.

1857
02:07:53,749 --> 02:07:56,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, wow, I swear we didn't do anything.

1858
02:07:56,912 --> 02:07:58,634
[SPEAKER_04]: What the crap was that?

1859
02:07:59,535 --> 02:08:01,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Skype just crashed on us in studio.

1860
02:08:01,516 --> 02:08:04,359
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the error message and that happened.

1861
02:08:04,399 --> 02:08:05,160
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

1862
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:06,121
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a robot.

1863
02:08:06,561 --> 02:08:10,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, first, no, dude, this is like the beginning of a scary movie right here.

1864
02:08:10,465 --> 02:08:12,367
[SPEAKER_04]: First we had the door blew open.

1865
02:08:12,847 --> 02:08:16,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have something happen with Zaku on the Skype line there.

1866
02:08:16,731 --> 02:08:17,732
[SPEAKER_04]: What the shit?

1867
02:08:19,130 --> 02:08:20,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm scared to take another call.

1868
02:08:20,591 --> 02:08:21,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what happened.

1869
02:08:21,571 --> 02:08:23,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was anything you did, Zaku.

1870
02:08:23,092 --> 02:08:23,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

1871
02:08:24,493 --> 02:08:25,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't do anything either.

1872
02:08:25,554 --> 02:08:26,234
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the weird thing.

1873
02:08:27,195 --> 02:08:28,055
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crazy.

1874
02:08:30,857 --> 02:08:31,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1875
02:08:31,757 --> 02:08:32,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take one more call.

1876
02:08:34,178 --> 02:08:34,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1877
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:37,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw something come up and I got excited.

1878
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:37,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to sleep, Jamie?

1879
02:08:38,681 --> 02:08:39,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night, Jamie.

1880
02:08:40,142 --> 02:08:41,062
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's going to sleep.

1881
02:08:42,563 --> 02:08:43,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1882
02:08:43,544 --> 02:08:43,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1883
02:08:46,417 --> 02:08:47,238
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Dark Knight.

1884
02:08:47,258 --> 02:08:49,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all must have had a one missed call moment.

1885
02:08:49,602 --> 02:08:50,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Dark Knight.

1886
02:08:50,123 --> 02:08:50,984
[SPEAKER_00]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1887
02:08:51,705 --> 02:08:54,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all must have had a one missed call moment or something when that happened.

1888
02:08:55,970 --> 02:08:56,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very weird.

1889
02:08:56,850 --> 02:08:58,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the hell's going on with Skype, but we'll see.

1890
02:08:58,931 --> 02:09:01,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I need to upgrade, but I thought I just upgraded last week, but whatever.

1891
02:09:02,251 --> 02:09:03,952
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1892
02:09:04,032 --> 02:09:20,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the layouts and whatnot, Free Radical, I can understand them shutting their doors and whatnot, because like I said, they had one buzz game and whatnot that didn't really make much money for them at all and whatnot.

1893
02:09:20,748 --> 02:09:26,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I mean, you know, it's still unfortunate they won't get a chance to do a second one, you know what I mean?

1894
02:09:26,774 --> 02:09:27,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1895
02:09:28,315 --> 02:09:31,018
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true, and they said they were working on the TimeSplitter game, right?

1896
02:09:31,138 --> 02:09:31,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

1897
02:09:32,239 --> 02:09:34,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, I mean, I can understand that.

1898
02:09:34,361 --> 02:09:35,282
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I understand that.

1899
02:09:35,322 --> 02:09:42,049
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as midwaying them, doing layouts and whatnot, that one's kind of hard to swallow because, I mean...

1900
02:09:43,837 --> 02:09:47,780
[SPEAKER_00]: The latest Mortal Kombat and whatnot, they've been making their money off of that.

1901
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:51,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I did say the Mortal Kombat team was left intact.

1902
02:09:52,083 --> 02:09:53,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Mortal Kombat team was left intact, okay.

1903
02:09:53,885 --> 02:09:56,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and Midway's kind of had a rough year outside of Mortal Kombat.

1904
02:09:56,687 --> 02:10:02,812
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we don't really know how the other games have been selling yet, but some of their other high-profile titles did not follow through the way they should.

1905
02:10:02,852 --> 02:10:08,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I can't think of a lot of Midway games I've gotten really excited about this year, which is kind of a bummer.

1906
02:10:09,357 --> 02:10:09,837
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know.

1907
02:10:10,558 --> 02:10:15,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought I would hear people talk about Blitz, but I don't even think I heard people talking about Blitz and everything like that.

1908
02:10:16,122 --> 02:10:16,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, nope.

1909
02:10:16,762 --> 02:10:20,365
[SPEAKER_04]: But then EA, I mean, EA's kind of, you know, their year hasn't been that terrible yet.

1910
02:10:20,385 --> 02:10:34,275
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a lot of layoffs too, so it's kind of... And that is a big shocker to hear that EA, I figured, I made a comment earlier saying that if one of the big game manufacturing companies did have any layoffs, then we'd really be scratching our heads.

1911
02:10:34,975 --> 02:10:35,676
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything else.

1912
02:10:36,104 --> 02:10:36,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft

1913
02:10:49,974 --> 02:10:50,715
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1914
02:11:09,267 --> 02:11:11,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was from their general company.

1915
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:13,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was from their entertainment division.

1916
02:11:13,811 --> 02:11:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but at least Microsoft and Sony, they have all those other divisions of their company.

1917
02:11:16,774 --> 02:11:17,555
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a huge, huge company.

1918
02:11:17,575 --> 02:11:18,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just about the games.

1919
02:11:18,616 --> 02:11:20,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, still.

1920
02:11:22,019 --> 02:11:30,006
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it just... And then you think about it, Sega is like Sega having their bad luck streak with their games and whatnot, all the Sonic games and whatnot.

1921
02:11:30,026 --> 02:11:32,148
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't find out problems with...

1922
02:11:33,169 --> 02:11:38,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems with their online gaming division and stuff like that.

1923
02:11:38,111 --> 02:11:39,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, here we go.

1924
02:11:42,253 --> 02:11:47,255
[SPEAKER_00]: If Sega was to go, then I'd be a lost sheep.

1925
02:11:47,275 --> 02:11:49,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I would cry with you.

1926
02:11:51,196 --> 02:11:55,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just that, but just that all these companies are getting swallowed up by other companies, too.

1927
02:11:55,698 --> 02:11:56,579
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1928
02:11:57,199 --> 02:11:59,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Koei and Tecmo.

1929
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:05,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Knight, anything else on your mind before we let you go tonight?

1930
02:12:05,805 --> 02:12:11,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just want to wish y'all guys a happy holidays and be safe and enjoy your presents and everything like that.

1931
02:12:11,831 --> 02:12:12,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And, phew.

1932
02:12:22,830 --> 02:12:23,250
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do.

1933
02:12:24,231 --> 02:12:25,371
[SPEAKER_00]: And see y'all in 09.

1934
02:12:25,531 --> 02:12:27,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play with my pest dispenser.

1935
02:12:27,072 --> 02:12:28,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Just open, close, open, close, open, close.

1936
02:12:28,793 --> 02:12:29,213
[SPEAKER_00]: All night long.

1937
02:12:29,613 --> 02:12:30,194
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

1938
02:12:30,234 --> 02:12:32,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Klingon's on a starboard belt, Captain.

1939
02:12:32,475 --> 02:12:32,735
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1940
02:12:33,535 --> 02:12:34,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1941
02:12:34,035 --> 02:12:35,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, Dark Knight.

1942
02:12:35,416 --> 02:12:35,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a safe one.

1943
02:12:35,996 --> 02:12:36,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Do say.

1944
02:12:37,097 --> 02:12:37,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1945
02:12:38,971 --> 02:12:40,472
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to close up the Skype line for now.

1946
02:12:40,552 --> 02:12:42,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry we didn't take a lot of calls tonight, but damn, it's cold out here.

1947
02:12:44,093 --> 02:12:46,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to give a quick plug before we close our doors tonight.

1948
02:12:46,795 --> 02:12:53,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a quick plug to our buddies over at Under Sedation Live, Travis Donovan and DMN.

1949
02:12:53,178 --> 02:12:55,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, I think he's officially retired that title now.

1950
02:12:55,939 --> 02:12:58,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's Insanist officially now, John.

1951
02:12:59,603 --> 02:13:04,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever his name is, he co-hosts the show over there Saturday nights on All Games Radio.

1952
02:13:04,628 --> 02:13:09,093
[SPEAKER_04]: They are putting together USOLR Madness 2009.

1953
02:13:09,293 --> 02:13:13,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm being corrected by the chat room.

1954
02:13:13,357 --> 02:13:14,718
[SPEAKER_04]: His new name is Brest Lowell.

1955
02:13:15,439 --> 02:13:16,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob

1956
02:13:33,789 --> 02:13:34,849
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1957
02:13:59,718 --> 02:14:05,242
[SPEAKER_04]: You can send in those emails with your top 25 games to uslmadness at gmail.com That's all one word.

1958
02:14:05,602 --> 02:14:13,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can look for more information on our forums at orangelaunceradio.com and I'm sure plenty of other information as well at Understation Live's website.

1959
02:14:15,328 --> 02:14:15,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1960
02:14:16,789 --> 02:14:18,730
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it though tonight for Orange Lounge Radio.

1961
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:22,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

1962
02:14:22,812 --> 02:14:23,913
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't do it without you guys.

1963
02:14:24,033 --> 02:14:24,593
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

1964
02:14:26,792 --> 02:14:27,012
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1965
02:14:46,495 --> 02:14:48,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just looking at it out of, you know, huh.

1966
02:14:48,856 --> 02:14:49,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a bad job, though.

1967
02:14:50,417 --> 02:14:51,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's all really good.

1968
02:14:51,417 --> 02:14:52,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's growing.

1969
02:14:52,557 --> 02:14:55,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really... Mine just... The last time... Wikipedia.

1970
02:14:55,678 --> 02:15:01,540
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time I looked at it, mine just said, tune into this show to hear about Rob's life, which I thought was funny.

1971
02:15:02,261 --> 02:15:04,582
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a link to my MySpace.

1972
02:15:04,602 --> 02:15:06,802
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute because I never update it anymore.

1973
02:15:07,042 --> 02:15:07,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this.

1974
02:15:07,963 --> 02:15:08,563
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought.

1975
02:15:08,583 --> 02:15:09,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do my final thought.

1976
02:15:09,223 --> 02:15:10,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do Loki's final thought.

1977
02:15:10,123 --> 02:15:11,604
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is shit cakes.

1978
02:15:11,904 --> 02:15:12,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

1979
02:15:13,845 --> 02:15:14,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1980
02:15:15,208 --> 02:15:20,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the different levels in this have different difficulties, so I'm skipping ahead to Final Fantasy 7.

1981
02:15:20,411 --> 02:15:29,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to play them in order, but apparently Final Fantasy 1 is like a level 5 or 5 star, and that's kind of hard, because I got my ass kicked pretty quick.

1982
02:15:29,717 --> 02:15:31,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I still kind of want to see a little more about this game.

1983
02:15:31,498 --> 02:15:34,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a... Oh, you can't use the video thing to play.

1984
02:15:34,179 --> 02:15:39,823
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I tried that later, because there was an update that they allowed PlayStation Network software to do...

1985
02:15:40,403 --> 02:15:45,204
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to output, but it's only classic PlayStation games, and that sucks.

1986
02:15:46,384 --> 02:15:47,005
[SPEAKER_04]: That's bullshit.

1987
02:15:47,545 --> 02:15:50,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of classic PlayStation games, I got Castlevania Chronicles this week.

1988
02:15:50,866 --> 02:15:51,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1989
02:15:51,826 --> 02:15:52,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1990
02:15:52,566 --> 02:15:54,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, we're going to close out the show now.

1991
02:15:54,086 --> 02:15:56,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting.

1992
02:15:57,167 --> 02:15:57,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1993
02:15:58,047 --> 02:15:59,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do my... I thought we did your final thought.

1994
02:15:59,748 --> 02:16:00,368
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1995
02:16:00,528 --> 02:16:01,908
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then, DarkSakura, your final thought.

1996
02:16:02,388 --> 02:16:03,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It's freaking cold in here.

1997
02:16:03,929 --> 02:16:05,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought your final thought was about your wiki.

1998
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:06,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was?

1999
02:16:07,121 --> 02:16:07,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's alright.

2000
02:16:07,841 --> 02:16:08,722
[SPEAKER_04]: You can talk about the cold.

2001
02:16:10,163 --> 02:16:11,504
[SPEAKER_02]: The cold froze my brain.

2002
02:16:11,844 --> 02:16:12,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2003
02:16:12,745 --> 02:16:13,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it.

2004
02:16:13,365 --> 02:16:16,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting and shows like ours.

2005
02:16:16,528 --> 02:16:17,668
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't be able to do it without you.

2006
02:16:17,728 --> 02:16:20,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Tune in next week for our year-end special.

2007
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:23,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I don't know if we're doing that much special for it because it's kind of on a weird day.

2008
02:16:24,153 --> 02:16:26,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bobby's doing a year-end special right before us.

2009
02:16:26,335 --> 02:16:28,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So we might just do a non-special year-end special.

2010
02:16:29,477 --> 02:16:30,878
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we will do listless.

2011
02:16:30,918 --> 02:16:31,678
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be sure of that.

2012
02:16:31,738 --> 02:16:33,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2013
02:16:34,020 --> 02:16:34,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye!

2014
02:16:50,510 --> 02:16:51,191
[SPEAKER_07]: or allgames.com.

2015
02:16:51,231 --> 02:16:52,452
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're probably right anyway.

2016
02:16:52,472 --> 02:16:53,033
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next week!
