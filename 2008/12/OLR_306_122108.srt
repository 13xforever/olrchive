With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Moloto

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, December 21st, 2008, many game companies lay off their employees this holiday season.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
LittleBigPlanet gets some big updates, and has a recent Xbox Live Arcade game been ported to the 8-bit Nintendo?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Happy Holidays, y'all. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Santa, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What?

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
DarkSakura, of course. How you doing?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am. I'm doing, um, crampy.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ho, ho, ho.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Bop fucking hump.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Try having cramps around Christmas, you'll curse your uterus.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Did Santa bring you cramps for Christmas?

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That and a migraine.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Maybe you were a bad girl.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Fuck, I was. I'd rather have coal, because then I could light it on fire and be warm.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Say hello as well to the one and only, Techmaster Loki.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
One of Santa's elves. Joining us to North Pole.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's correct.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Highly accurate.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How are you this week?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm doing fine.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Anything exciting planned for the holidays?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Um, yes.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All right, then. Can you tell us about it?

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, I will in just a minute.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, well, okay then.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, you should already know what it is, but, like, there's lots of stuff leading up to that.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, sometimes I play stupid for the sake of the listeners.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It gets you to retell the story, even though you might have already told me.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sometimes I don't know when you're pretending.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Radio magic. Radio magic.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's commentary in the chat room, Rob, about you saying y'all.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com. Do they not like the y'all? Am I not allowed to say that because I'm from NorCal?

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You didn't say it right.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, what was I supposed to say?

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Y'all.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Y'all.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Or, depending on certain parts, Ewins.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Ewins?

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yep.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And Jayrod in chat wants to point out, my girlfriend also has cramps. Coincidence or evil plot?

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We're here to make your Christmas suffer, you know, a little bit.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Could it be a conspiracy? Are all the gamer chicks on one big cycle? That's what I want to know.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And only unless we've all been hanging out in the same room for at least two months.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Did you know, Rob, here's your unwanted education.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, lordy.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That if you get women living in the same place for long enough, their cycles will align.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No, I've heard it. That's why I was making the joke.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That all the gaming girls, you know, somehow via Xbox Live, I don't know, have all gotten on the same cycle.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Man, I'm a suck in college.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, actually, because-

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Like, everybody hide, it's the two-

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No, it was actually true for my dorm.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I could bet.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Because I had a suite. So me, my roommate, and our suite mate were all like, chocolate wine, now.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Of course, we were poor, so it was, you know, Strawberry Hill or Apple Wine.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Mad Dog?

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We at least had the taste to get the tasty Boon's Farm stuff.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nice.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And Everclear.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Alright.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Because it was Alabama, and you could get Everclear.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Alright.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Anyhow, look, we're going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week, because we always start off the show.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Not How Was Your Vagina, but How Was Your Gaming Week, Dark Sakura.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How Was Your Vag- Gaming Week.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I played Vagina Wars.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No kidding.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Um, what?

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Nothing.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Um, I actually turned on my DS and then turned it right off when I got a phone call and forgot to play again.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I played some Ragnarok, because I'm still playing.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Ooh.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And I've decided that I might actually go back to World of Warcraft for just a little bit, just to see what the new expansion's like.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But I really don't think I'll stick with it.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's more of a, huh, why not, while I'm waiting for the Star Trek MMO.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm going to warn you, if you're not at least level 55 in World of Warcraft, you won't see anything in the new expansion.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's all endgame content and a new class.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's it.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So, sadly, there won't be a lot there for you.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to play a Draenei.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Draenei's are fun.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And name her, um, I don't know, I had a name I was going to name her, but I forgot.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because the Draenei women talk like Natasha from Rocky and Bewinkle.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Boris, look, he's moose and squirrel.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He's fearless leader, darling.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I guess that would suit.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But, um, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What?

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I, um, I am going to, in the next week, download Shoei Nikki.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, I know what else it was.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I actually sat and watched a playthrough of Abadox.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And how was that?

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Just as shitty as I remember.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
God, that game's hella old isn't it?

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's old and hard, and I love that game, but it is kind of a crap game.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,400
Cuz it's like that's from Gradius huh, that's from life force hmm. That's from Gradius hmm. That's from life force

106
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,880
The one unique thing about it was the down scrolling levels

107
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,280
That was kind of as opposed to up scrolling from life force exactly there you go

108
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Loki how was your gaming week?

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,000
I played more Grand Theft Auto on PC

110
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
and

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,960
I've actually started tweaking some stuff now because they've made it a little bit easier for you to actually edit stuff in the game

112
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,960
You just kind of have to know what you're doing. It's a little bit like the cheat device was on

113
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,640
The Grand Theft Auto's on PSP similar type of stuff

114
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,520
You know you have a file that you edit some of the amounts with actually it's a lot easier on the PC version because everything's

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
labeled for you, so I made a

116
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,240
Pistol that would catch a cop car and fire in one shot, and that was funny

117
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,920
But just some of that stuff then the game crashed because I shot too many cars and caught him on fire

118
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,520
Apparently didn't like that much fire at one time

119
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,160
But it's kind of like finding a balance you know between

120
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,760
Crazy shit and between fuego and non yeah well see my next thing

121
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:24,160
I want to do is because you can make your gunfire have so much kickback to it like if you shoot somebody

122
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,640
It'll knock them over or you can make them like fly away and that type of stuff, so I want to do that

123
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,440
But I also want to have the trainer where I have infinite health so I can basically you know catapult myself with rockets

124
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,540
You know across the map that might be fun, so

125
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,400
You know eventually I'll do that, but there aren't that many mods out there for right now. There's like a drifting mod

126
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,720
a mod that changes the car names to I guess realistic cars and then

127
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,280
You know the rocket pistol thing which I was trying to do that myself and the first time it

128
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,000
Glitched it out where I actually couldn't select that pistol anymore

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,920
But then I figured out what I was doing wrong, and I don't know it's just not quite to where I need it to be yet

130
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,080
But soon it will be and then of course you know more Grand Theft Auto 4

131
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
multiplayer at work

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
and that's still fun and

133
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,840
Other than Grand Theft Auto I've been playing

134
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,720
Dissida the new Final Fantasy fighting game and it's

135
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
awesome

136
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,040
You know it's kind of really cool because it's one of those games like you purchase it

137
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,040
And then they have the prologue video, and it's like

138
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,440
Listen, I know you're a fan of Final Fantasy, and I want to assure you that this was an excellent choice

139
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,360
And then they kick your ass with a really awesome intro video, and then the game itself is pretty fun

140
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,560
It's a little hard for me to play because I don't understand Japanese so the game rapes you, but consensually

141
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,080
In a gentle way that you appreciate it. It's gentle rape. All right. It's just like it's like oh my god

142
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
This is awesome. That can't be rape if you're willing

143
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,840
So just say that's like a roleplay thing. Maybe it's a bit of a

144
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,040
Sadism I see it would be like a hot chick all of a sudden getting naked and thrusting herself upon you

145
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,800
But like see you're at first you're kind of like whoa what's going on here, but then you just go with it

146
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,240
So yeah, it's I wouldn't know I haven't had that happen

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,840
But no, it's it's really really awesome. It really kind of disappoints me though that they haven't brought. I wish they would make this I

148
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,720
Put it on like the ps3 or something like that and then also expand upon it because you know this is as basically fighting

149
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,720
That's all it is they have a little bit of cutscenes and stuff like that

150
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,240
But there's no actual like you know role-playing running around that kind of stuff

151
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,080
But they kept the fighting system in here and like say did a Kingdom Hearts type of thing where you have all the different characters

152
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,440
from the different games

153
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,080
They could really have a kick-ass game on their hands, but you know this is that itself is gonna be really awesome

154
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,680
So DJ Dark Knight in chat at chat.org.com jokes. This is a aka or guys, too

155
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,240
No, it's not even close to urgots. No way. That's not it's not even

156
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
remotely close

157
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,440
But boy does it have a funky name just like you know square likes to really give their game some funky names

158
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,920
It does, but it's awesome. It really is awesome

159
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,680
I got the fight garland that was really cool, and it has it broken up by each game

160
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,200
So like I'm starting off with Final Fantasy 1 and so I'm playing the warrior of light

161
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,880
I guess or something and then I fought garland for the first level there and

162
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Is the Warriors name AAA?

163
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,800
No, they has no name. It's just the warrior of light or poop. It's my cartridge. No. It's not poop

164
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
But it's cool

165
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,000
Look as you level up the characters they level up and all the other levels that they appear in as well

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,760
So I think I did have a party in Final Fantasy because I'm this mature. I think it was ass assy, but and poop I

167
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,440
Think the last time when we played it on because I have the

168
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:10,840
The WonderSwan one in Japanese. I actually sat down and tried to figure out the names to put in it in

169
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,200
Katakana, so we had Dan, Jamie

170
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,640
Dan made Eric for some reason one of his buddies who's kind of not all that all that bright

171
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,280
And I don't remember who we named the last one

172
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,640
My Chrono Trigger cartridge actually still has my friend save on it. It has me and there's Luca

173
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,240
But seriously though like, you know, not to interrupt or anything

174
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,200
This game could be like Kingdom Hearts, but without

175
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,480
You know the Disney characters

176
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,080
I mean if they for whatever reason lost the Disney license

177
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,600
They could easily do something like that with these characters and just some massive scale and it would be so much awesome

178
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,840
I want to point these

179
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,320
Observations out in the chat room shower and says did garland say I garland shall knock you out all down

180
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,840
And that was said at the exact same time as game grew asking to garland knock you all down

181
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,160
I don't know. It's in Japanese, so I can't read that but maybe he did in

182
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Japanese I don't know

183
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Alrighty then anything else you've been playing this week

184
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,480
Animal crossing played a little more animal crossing. I don't know why I'm still playing animal cross

185
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,320
I need to come visit Nellie's village. I know well the thing is I tried

186
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,080
you

187
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,880
Know I don't understand this you apparently you have to talk to some idiot in the town to get a friend code

188
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
What the fuck the guy at the gate?

189
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,760
All the last versions, too, okay, that's great

190
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,280
But why the hell do I have to talk to somebody you have a friend codes assigned to the game?

191
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,720
It's stupid that way it connects to Nintendo Wi-Fi

192
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,520
The first time I can extend it also is different per player

193
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,700
Yeah, yeah, and so yeah what you want you get it from Nintendo Wi-Fi

194
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,720
Then you can access it whenever in the game, so you just have to do it that one time

195
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm fine, so I have to do that, but yeah, I haven't gone around to that yet. I

196
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,920
Will them awesome all right well then my gaming week

197
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,880
I played a little bit of Animal Crossing, but not a lot

198
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,760
I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff honestly it was a lot of the same stuff

199
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I've talked about in previous weeks Prince of Persia

200
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
World of Warcraft

201
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,920
And the only new game I really checked out this week was a dash

202
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,640
What's so damn funny over there dark Sakura? I hear her giggling. I was looking at uncyclopedia about lavas

203
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,160
This is full name lavas big-ass porcupine from hell Thompson Smith

204
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,720
Uncyclopedia is so string is also a picture of one of the little aliens bursting out of someone's stomach

205
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,540
Is this picture taken by hospital staff one minute after lavas was born cute little scamp wasn't he I?

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,120
Think somebody in chats that made a lavas joke something about oh Dan shadow says you think that's fun try playing chrono trigger and name

207
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
everyone lavas

208
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,680
And I don't know what that's supposed to do all right anyway um the only new game

209
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,160
I played this week was the free game. I love free games, and there was a free game to hit Xbox live this week

210
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,360
I don't know if y'all remember, but it's Doritos dash of destruction

211
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:02,320
Which was I think it was like I think it's an XNA game that somebody made or it was like concept forget one some type

212
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,120
Of contest. I don't know if it was next

213
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,620
I read it was a like try to come up with a concept for a game, and then they made a Doritos game

214
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:16,620
Yeah, which which actually kind of worked out because it does it doesn't like overdo it with the Doritos like doesn't beat the Doritos

215
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,900
Thing into you like you know obviously it's there, and there's definitely the product placement

216
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,680
But the game is so random like it otherwise really has nothing to do with tortilla chips or whatever you want to call Doritos

217
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,600
They you basically you can play as a truck or you drive around the town trying to deliver Doritos

218
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,020
But you know whatever it could be anything and or you can play a t-rex and chase said trucks

219
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,020
So it's kind of an interesting little cat-and-mouse

220
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,340
Concept and I gotta say you know it's better than yours as far as free games

221
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,460
Go is this something I would have paid money for

222
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,980
Probably not maybe

223
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,780
$5 maybe

224
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:58,040
But you know it's a cute little cat-and-mouse thing going on where you can you know play the truck trying to deliveries or you?

225
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,660
Can go and out try to eat the trucks, and you know that made it kind of fun

226
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,300
But I don't think it's anything it's gonna have like a lasting value to it

227
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,220
You know a lot of the levels kind of look the same plus you just would

228
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,260
Unexplainably get these power-ups that didn't seem to do a whole lot of anything

229
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,260
And the game it was handing out achievements like candy like it was really one of those games

230
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,580
It was like push start you got an achievement for pushing start

231
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,540
You know like that's how it kind of felt to me, but you know I'm sure the achievement whores will enjoy that

232
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,340
But it was you know again for free. It's really hard to complain

233
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,660
It is probably actually you know considering the free games. I can think of on Xbox live. We had what Yaris we had

234
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,860
a

235
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,620
Totem ball we had the shooter game Aegis wing that was that was pretty cool, too

236
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,580
I put this on about the same level so it's it's a it's a decent free game

237
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,380
Because considering it was product placement and my expectations were very very low

238
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,940
There's also it wasn't bad this hold them. Oh, yeah, Texas hold them was free for a little while

239
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,260
Yeah, that's true, but now it's not so that was more of a limited time for you

240
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Yeah, you know what else is not free hmm apparently if you delete your copy of

241
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:07,620
Hexic HD mm-hmm you have to pay $10 to get it back really yeah, I didn't know that

242
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,500
I actually transferred hard drives this week

243
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,300
I finally got 120 gig hard drive

244
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,060
And did the transfer and it kind of freaked me out because when I did the transfer it said some files were corrupt and could

245
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,180
Not be transferred. I'm like shit. What did I lose? I haven't figured out what I've lost yet, so your marbles

246
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:28,460
Well besides that I mean like what on the Xbox 360 day. I lose. I hope it wasn't any of the rock band tracks

247
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,060
I'm just not gonna notice. They're gone, or if it was like hopefully it was one of like the crappy ones

248
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,820
We can always redownload them. That's true. What about the original rock band song so

249
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,700
You'd have to redownload them unless you sold them hmm if you sold it back

250
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,540
Then you're kind of screwed there. I did actually never did so I still know people who still have

251
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,740
I haven't checked I haven't checked to see what got corrupted

252
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,340
But I haven't played rock bands since the transfer so I would I know that was probably the largest chunk of my old hard drive

253
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,540
Was rock band songs because I have a lot of rock band songs

254
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,180
You know because I have the rock band one exported the entire no doubt album and just like at least

255
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,020
20 download songs on top of that so pretty crazy. Well. I finally bought a

256
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,180
Hard drive transfer thing that's not

257
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,300
part of Microsoft's

258
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,580
You know transfer kit. It's actually something to dump files to your hard drive and that kind of stuff

259
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,620
To get well on top of you know

260
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,860
potential modding things

261
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:34,580
To basically move the two popcap game saves that pop cap for some reason said no you can't transfer to us

262
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:41,180
You know a memory unit. We're gonna be dicks about that, and then yeah, I love how on Twitter. They're like oh, yeah

263
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,180
We're looking into that

264
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,520
We're looking into I saw you got a response though that was basically they couldn't figure it out

265
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,600
No, the response was like you have to redownload the game like what the fuck does it have to do with my save file stupid

266
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,040
not like

267
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,680
Transferring the game talking about the save file well wait a minute though like I theorized a couple weeks ago in this first came up

268
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,080
Maybe this is something that was kind of out of their control like you know

269
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:11,080
They it's not out of their control all the other games before and after them have allowed me to move the save files

270
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,240
To a memory unit and you know move it to another hard drive

271
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,120
You know you may not be able to copy them to other you know profiles

272
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,120
I understand that that makes perfect sense, but not being able to move it at all. That's retarded

273
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,720
You know what else did that hexick HD won't let you move this thing so screw you

274
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Microsoft and screw you popcap that's right, though. I'm gonna do it anyways. I will find a way

275
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,200
I know we have people from popcap that listen, so I I hope well

276
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,840
That's why it does not go on both, but you'll do and Zuma

277
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:50,840
For whatever reason your stupid save files won't move not the game the game is fine because I can delete it download it move

278
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,720
It whatever I need to do, but the save files will not move

279
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,160
And I'm assuming this is a big crisis in your house because Zuma is like no

280
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,800
It's not a big crisis, but it's annoying because if you know my wife principle of the thing yes

281
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,880
We put in a lot of time to you know Bejeweled 2 which I might add there the achievements are

282
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,520
damn near impossible to get but you know for whatever reason we put in a lot of time into it and

283
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,320
Especially Zuma. Zuma gets pretty hard too, and at least that I can get some achievements in but Bejeweled 2 is a bitch

284
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,760
But yeah, I don't want to lose all my progress in that you know it's a game

285
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,640
I don't care if it's a crappy game. It's still progress, and I don't want to lose it

286
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,160
But in the fact that you know I can understand hexick because they want you to buy the hard drives and that kind of stuff

287
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,720
I mean whatever, but the save files is just these two games

288
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,840
That won't let me transfer them everything else works like everything. I got all that stuff moved over and took forever, but it worked

289
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,480
But these two save files are just I don't know so I'm gonna try moving them with this one program that I got and

290
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,000
If that doesn't work, then I give up, so

291
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,280
Sj100 Matt wants to point out now if Nellie lost her excite truck save file, then shit would hit the fan yes

292
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,720
But it might give her another reason to play it again

293
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,760
I do want to say this is Matt brought up PopCap

294
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,480
I did play the new Bejeweled thing on Facebook

295
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,720
They have like a Bejeweled tournament thing on Facebook

296
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,300
Where you get like a minute to get as many points as you can and right now

297
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,480
I'm on the top of the leaderboard at least of my friends list because you can't see everybody you can see your friends list I got

298
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,400
55,000 in one minute I got really lucky with the chains

299
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
That's all I can say but I thought that was kind of cute that they put that on Facebook, so

300
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,680
Anyhow um so anything else for gaming weeks around anybody?

301
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,920
I played rock band like the first one yeah

302
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,000
Cuz that's what Julie got and I have to say I've forgotten how much I hate the rock band guitars

303
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,000
But now I remember cuz it was forced upon me, and I hate them. Why is that they're flimsy?

304
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,640
they may be better for strumming, but they most the time the keys stick on both of them and

305
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,060
They wouldn't sync properly for the wireless one, and it was just a pain in the ass and next time

306
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,340
I go over there is I'm bringing my guitar hero controllers

307
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,500
All right watch a lot of net stuff. I know isn't the Netflix thing on 360 great

308
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,600
I watched a documentary this week because now Netflix

309
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,620
No, Netflix got smart, and they added an HD category on their watch instantly things

310
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,540
I was looking at HD movies, and I watched a documentary because I've been all about the obscure documentaries on Netflix

311
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,960
I don't know why but I watched an obscure documentary about

312
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,380
The people that dress up as superheroes on Hollywood Boulevard and post for pictures

313
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,540
I care ethics called confessions of a superhero was the name of the movie and

314
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,980
It was interesting it was interesting seeing the reasons

315
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:46,300
Why people did it some did it because they were like obsessed with their character some people did it just another job some people did

316
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,420
It because they have issues a lot of issues Rob

317
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,760
I want to come over and watch documentaries with you now that I don't have school. It's fun

318
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,480
I said I have work. That's a sad thing. I have work, but not every day work. Yeah, I know

319
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,280
I'm gonna come come watch documentaries with you all right. Well. It's fun. Well a documentary night

320
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,400
We'll try to see who can find the most obscure document

321
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,400
There are some obscure documentaries on Netflix documentaries. I got a screener copy of

322
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,880
Eathletes uh-huh which if I remember correctly. I think that's the

323
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,960
Film that Scott Rubin actually did some of the shooting for it's about those two counter-strike teams

324
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,400
And they came to El Dorado Hills to do part of the tournament there

325
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,880
And he was filming a second unit or whatever on that that was kind of neat

326
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,920
Hmm, I don't haven't gotten a chance to watch it yet though tiger law points out. Yeah confessions of a superhero

327
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,120
I believe all games interactive interviewed the chick that plays Wonder Woman on it, and it may set suma back set up

328
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,960
You know I I did I was not aware of that

329
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,600
I kind of fell out of the loop of AGI just because they were putting out so many shows a week

330
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
And I couldn't listen to him because I had to teach all day

331
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,320
But the chick that played Wonder Woman was probably the most normal out of everybody in the movie

332
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,000
Absolutely she had some marital problems, but she seemed the most

333
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,240
Stable I mean no quote unquote normal out of anybody there was so she didn't to me

334
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
She didn't look a lot like Wonder Woman

335
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,800
Maybe yeah, maybe that sounds cruel, but I just I just didn't see the little her costume was decent

336
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,280
But I just didn't see like she did not look at like Wonder Woman as much as Batman looked like Batman or Superman

337
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,760
Look like Superman. There's only one only one Wonder Woman ever and

338
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,840
She was in the 70s, and she was freaking fantastic, and I really enjoyed seeing her in sky-high

339
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,720
Is you gonna say something lucky no

340
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,920
I thought it's I thought I've actually seen part of that show or Linda something that had to do with those people that were on

341
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,840
Hollywood Boulevard you might hostile one in chat says I've seen that doc they even said that people

342
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,720
Were protective like I'm the only one who can play Superman on this block

343
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Yeah, perhaps I

344
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,120
Don't know. I don't remember

345
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,160
They didn't really get into the inner politics

346
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,680
But I thought it was really funny because like people like they like it was this big change when Elmo got arrested

347
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,960
And they showed the news stories like Elmo and mr.. Incredible got busted on Hollywood Boulevard this week

348
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,960
They joined the Cookie Monster in the interest for the way. They were harassing tourists or something like that. This is it was interesting

349
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,440
It's just funny to hear the news. I want some money for drugs give Elmo money

350
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:23,040
It was just funny to hear about Elmo getting arrested. I don't know why I'm easily amused all right look

351
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,520
Let's move on with the show talking about housekeeping tonight

352
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,860
If you were wondering there will be a show next week

353
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,060
There is still a show next week the holidays will not be getting in the way same bat time same bat channel although

354
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,440
Bobby the man who does the show before us is doing his annual year-end special

355
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,880
Next week, and he's gonna have some guests on his show and all that fun stuff

356
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,160
He might be starting a little early, and we might let him run a little late

357
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,040
To help our yeah, maybe details a little just a little

358
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,520
So we'll see but that means that means it made me realize that means next week is our year-end show I

359
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,860
Wasn't even thinking about it, but yeah next week's the year-end show can you believe it?

360
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Yes, because it comes the same time every year. Yeah, and in there will be no show on the week of

361
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
January

362
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:18,560
11th there is no show. I'm gonna be in Hawaii. I will not be here the weekend of the 31st what cuz I'm going to Disneyland

363
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720

366
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,960
Don't worry it's done. We will not cut off the Bobby Black Wolf show if they go it a little long

There's Star Trek Pez dispensers. That is all kinds of rad look at that

379

That's like the entire original cast and the enterprise as a Pez dispenser

It's supposed to be limited, but I don't know that is friggin amazing

381
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,880
And most importantly I want to point out

382
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,740
Sulu George Takei does have his own Pez to censor. What'd you get there Sarah Ragnarok? Yes? Hi, dude?

Very nice

385
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,940
Actually I was because the artwork is a different style, and so I wasn't looking at the character designs I was reading

386
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:00,820

He's all right, and so it didn't have Bob Barker, or you know dude, dude, but pressure luck is epic

393
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,740
It's old school. That's amazing sure that's amazing

399
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,180

That's pretty cool. They're up

401
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,360
Yes, I don't know what that book is I didn't want to open it

402
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,920
You know so I don't know if that's the manual or like an art book or something that they threw in

403
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
I'm gonna open it right now

404
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
But I figured you know

405
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Ragnarok

406
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,120
DJ dark night brought up something about the prices right there reminded me

407
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,200
Did you see the in chat room?

408
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,560
Did you see the talk about the guy on the price is right that nailed the showcase on the head the manual?

409
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,200
Yeah, I was joking about how I think that's that's a giant conspiracy

410
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,120
There's more in my life journal

411
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,840
Hitstun says does Ragnarok DS. Have any sort of online play. I think it's a few players like local

412
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,280
This is fantastic because you um you do your attacks and spell casting

413
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,680
by

414
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
stylus control

415
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,280
All right

416
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,480
Well, what a happy holiday. We have here on orange launch radio this week

417
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,920
Except for me. I'm a Grinch because I didn't fucking give out

418
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,080
Well, I'm I'm doing something different this year

419
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,040
It has this the skill trees in here

420
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,360
I just didn't want to forget these all in my house, and I started to get into the point now where I'm like

421
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,000
Whose gift is that whose gift is that? Oh crap? I gotta get rid of these nice

422
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
All right, whoo

423
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,840
Now that we are all bit. We've all been there's classes that are just for the um DS

424
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,120
We're gonna hear a little tidbits about Ragnarok DS all night long

425
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,520
There's a dark night. Yeah, if I DJ dark night and chat says Jamie wishes she could bring her online character to the DS game

426
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,120
Quite possibly my characters are like over a hundred and twenty something right now

427
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,400
So because I'm playing on private server. Yeah, I was gonna say plus you play on bootleg servers

428
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,360
So I don't think that would be a dark night's fucking hot. I like J-roz star trek peso spencer

429
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,240
What a thoughtful way to carry around your ecstasy

430
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
That's amazing

431
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
That's amazing

432
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,240
That's amazing. No. I love the star trek peso dispensers. That's great

433
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,280
You know I haven't really been like super into peso collecting in a while, but I still think stuff like this is so awesome

434
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,520
Especially the fact that it's all of them like you didn't have to buy each one individually wow it's limited edition, too

435
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,120
What a cool. Yeah, I saw that they have those at a cost plus

436
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,080
That is so rad. I was like dude. I kind of picked this up for Rob. That's amazing

437
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,040
Yeah, I thought about getting another imagine game this year for the DS

438
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,080
But I figured actually giving you something useful instead of you know

439
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,520
I'm putting pictures up in a second sweet all right, so anyway is that going on your Twitter all right?

440
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,960
Well, I'll link the picture in the chat room because my Twitter is blocked from almost everybody so oh you could log into the olr one

441
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,680
If you want all right, uh let's let's move on and get into some gaming news

442
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,640
You know that we're past past the holiday stuff listening now

443
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,680
We're gonna go some from such happy joyous wonderful news to not so great news tonight

444
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,160
Not so great news tonight, and I want you to listen to the first stories in tonight's

445
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,840
Show and see if they all have something in common because it's kind of sad actually it's kind of a bummer

446
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,640
We have to follow up such a positive stuff with this

447
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,440
Factor 5 has closed its doors the developer known for such games as lair

448
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,200
And some better games as star wars broke squadron and even like turrican series

449
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,520
Um and apparently they were being rumored to be working on the new kid Icarus and Superman games

450
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,680
But they have closed their superman 128. It's the curse of spider-man. I'm sorry. It's superman. I tell you it's just it's a new

451
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,720
Superman not tiny of the movie, but

452
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,960
So they have closed their doors, and it was supposedly confirmed by Matt Casamani

453
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,400
from IgM who had I believe

454
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
received an email from

455
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,120
Julian at Factor 5 says hi Matt. How have you been?

456
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,360
Wanted to contact you with some late-breaking news

457
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,400
We just learned inside sources that developer Factor 5 has officially closed the doors as of today

458
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,400
That's some pretty big news considering that those guys have been around for quite a while

459
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,800
It's definitely a real shame, and I hope this information is helpful to you

460
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,760
Do you know who we have to blame for this lair?

461
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,960
No, Ronald Regan. Why? Reganomics

462
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,680
Seriously, that's what caused um, that's one of the big contributors to our financial crisis right now

463
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,200
Well, perhaps it continues on in these other stories we're getting into such as about electronic arts

464
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Electronic arts had to cut

465
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:46,400
1,000 jobs and closed like nine different publishing locations including one of them called black box studio

466
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,360
This is in addition to when they already laid off six percent of their staff back in October

467
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,560
So now it's just been basically an increase to a ten percent reduction overall. It was 1,000 employees

468
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,520
That are all being phased out by March 31st

469
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,040
So well, I guess hooray that some get to keep their jobs through the holidays, but still

470
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,920
Blackbox studio in Vancouver is going to be merged with the EA studio in nearby Burnaby

471
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,880
Wow, so this is going to save the company 120 million annually

472
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,000
But costing them about 60 million in restructuring charges while this goes on

473
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,240
Kind of a bummer for those folks that got laid off. Sorry to hear about I had some friends that worked at EA

474
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,800
I have no idea, you know, they're not people I talk to every day

475
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,520
So, I don't know if anybody I know isn't affected by this but still

476
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,120
My thoughts are with you guys. This is this is very unfortunate

477
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Well, um, there actually is a going for midway to the rumor was that they were going to be laying out

478
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,920
Laying out laying off, um around 160 people from the Chicago studio for the most part because of financial issues

479
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,400
The official word is that they're laying 25 percent off of its workforce. So that's about 180 people

480
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,480
130 people from Chicago and 45 from Austin

481
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,400
The Austin operation itself has closed and then there's supposed to be some other

482
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,840
Games that were unannounced that are being suspended. So they're just trying to uh,

483
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:19,200
I guess mitigate, you know, whatever the costs are apparently the Mortal Kombat team is safe. We can all sleep

484
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Easy, I think

485
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,200
Whatever. It's just crap

486
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,000
And

487
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Even more upsetting for me

488
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,720
Free Radical has closed shop. Um, apparently their doors were locked and all the employees were locked out

489
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,640
While the company was having some final meetings deciding what the fate of the company was going to be

490
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,600
Of course Free Radical is known for the

491
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,320
Kind of a failure ps3 game haze but better known for their time splitter series as well as um,

492
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,000
Remember to be working on Star Wars Battlefront II

493
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,280
They were working on TimeSplitters IV. Um, so that kind of sucks

494
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
but um

495
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,960
The good news is though is they may not be out of work for long. Apparently some other companies are looking to

496
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,040
Purchase Free Radical and kind of absorb them into their

497
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,800
You know

498
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,360
Developing firms. So that's kind of good because I want to see TimeSplitters IV. It was kind of neat since they were

499
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,960
You know

500
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,200
Looking for new jobs. Some of the people are working on different art. We're releasing assets for TimeSplitters IV and oh man, it looked awesome

501
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,280
Also if that doesn't work out, the founder of Free Radical is setting up a new studio called Pumpkin Beach

502
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
And right now he's got 20 former

503
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,320
Free Radical developers and um,

504
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,160
You know, there's going to be that seems like a lot of development for just a week. Did this all happen this week?

505
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,040
Yeah, wow. Yeah. Um, so I guess

506
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,840
The guess will the the new studio had been formed a few months before this whole

507
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
I guess

508
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:16,080
Um, I guess, uh, the thing happened. So, you know, this was

509
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,160
You know working out before everything. Maybe he kind of figured that this was going to happen anyways, and so kind of a

510
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,020
precautionary measure but um

511
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,720
That's what I'm wondering if this guy didn't kind of see the writing on the wall

512
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,600
Maybe but um, yeah, hopefully some way or another that TimeSplitters IV comes out. That's really all that i'm concerned about

513
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,080
You know that and that these people have jobs, but mainly TimeSplitters IV

514
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,880
GameGuru in chat says this is what happens when you don't support the console that won. That's the Wii my friends

515
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh, but wait a minute. Look at EA. They just laid off a bunch of people. They they've been big supporters of the Wii, right?

516
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
They've been sort of, yeah.

517
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,080
GameGuru says the economic crisis just accelerated the problem. I can't really say Free Radical

518
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,400
Wasn't supporting, you know, the Wii. They've only made one game since the new consoles have come out, you know, Haze, so

519
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
That's not really fair

520
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,800
Well, another company is seem to be cutting back on staff. It's uh,

521
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,360
I'm sorry, Asper is the name of the company and they are based out of Austin

522
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,080
They're probably most known for some of their porting work

523
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,360
They ported Call of Duty 4 and Sims 2 to the PC and the Mac respectively. They got hit with layoffs this week

524
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:34,100
They got hit with layoffs this week more than a dozen temporary full-time employees were laid off as well as some other regular employees

525
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,800
More layoffs are expected and the company also shut down internal servers

526
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,200
Also some other stuff they did Guitar Hero 3 they did that port

527
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Wow, so, uh, no, uh comments out of Asper that I should note though that that story was just a rumor status only

528
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,360
Um, however, it unfortunately would not be surprising considering all the other news we're hearing this week

529
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,760
well

530
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
It's not really just those we've got

531
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,280
more

532
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,560
turbine

533
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,080
is um

534
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,600
going to be uh

535
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
cutting jobs

536
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,360
according to uh

537
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:18,480
What they're saying is that they are actually going to be um, they didn't say how many but the quote says as part of this transition

538
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,400
Some of our talented colleagues will not be with us going forward

539
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,400
So ouch yeah, in other words are like oh fuck bye

540
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,560
Really

541
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:39,280
So let me point out that's one two three four five six companies in one week

542
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,160
That have all done some type of layoffs right before Christmas right before the holidays assholes

543
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:51,520
Although granted some of them have uh, you know our um, like ea was transitioning them out on march 31st or whatever

544
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,280
But some of them just came to work and found that the doors and windows were all locked

545
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,000
Which is I don't know kind of messed up. It's it's just sad. I mean that reminds me of when dan got laid off in the money store

546
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,960
Really? Is that what happened similar? They just went in found a bunch of people walking out with stuff

547
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
And so they're like, um, just pack your desks and go

548
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,600
wow

549
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
My gosh, they bribed us to stay

550
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,040
um

551
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Here's my question. Is this going to continue? I mean this was six in a week

552
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,080
Are we gonna see more throughout the next few weeks or what's gonna happen? Blame Reagan blame Bush

553
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,920
I I who's next blame the Republicans. Well, wait a minute though. Let's not get too political here

554
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,360
Seriously if you look at it historically the reason why you're wearing all this financial shit is because of

555
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:47,880
of reagan's whole reaganomics crap and the fact that you know people have decided just to

556
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,440
You know screw us over instead of you know, putting money back into the economy where it goes

557
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,120
You know, we're spending money on a war. We didn't need to spend you know money on

558
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,680
And all this other bullshit

559
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,920
It just should have looked out what the country needs and go for the best thing and now as a result

560
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,880
We're seeing and it's not just this there's other companies like I went to uh old fulsome

561
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:14,600
Today and I say yesterday and at least a third of the old shops there were either closed or going out of business

562
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,720
The coffee place I go to they close down without a word

563
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,200
It's just you're seeing more and more businesses closing down. It's not just in the video game industry

564
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,160
Regardless of you know, whatever path we took to get here. How are we gonna get out?

565
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,040
I guess would be my question is I mean is the end in sight are we gonna get out of this anytime soon?

566
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,120
What's it gonna take? I mean, do we just need to buy more video games or what?

567
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:46,680
Well, it's a lot more complex than that. I mean a lot of it is going to be consumers, you know having more faith

568
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,680
In the industries and you know putting their money into product

569
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,320
But um, it's also going to mean that to be able to put money into the purchase of products

570
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,680
There need to be the jobs available. So it's very much right now a catch-22 damn if you do damn if you don't

571
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,080
It's it's really gonna take

572
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,680
I think the companies being able to be in a financial position to where they can start hiring again

573
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:17,960
And start putting out more product so that these people who now have fresh incomes can go out and put their money back into the the

574
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,640
Money flow. Oh, we'll see what happens in 2009. Hopefully it won't be much longer. We'll see though

575
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,840
Moving on um, you know all this news makes us very sad and upset and angry that all these uh,

576
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,640
Great game studios are just closing their way on well some not so great, but they're all closing their doors

577
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,680
Uh, it just stinks the whole thing stinks. And so we uh dedicate the fus of the week to uh,

578
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,640
Those without a job this week

579
00:40:43,640 --> 00:41:01,960
Is that a job this week my first fu goes towards my girl bits for hurting me and causing you pain

580
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,400
Therefore I have to turn around and hurt other people and cause them pain

581
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,640
Because they don't have to endure this type of thing. So we have to share it with them somehow

582
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:17,080
Um, also, um an fu goes um on behalf of one of my friends who didn't necessarily say this herself

583
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,320
But i'm passing it on for her

584
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,960
Um to uh the lack of uh proper transplants for her dad

585
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,880
um, she is a really good friend of mine from college and I hope that her dad gets uh, the liver and

586
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
other organs he needs soon because

587
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,680
He really really needs it

588
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:41,080
And um, my my final fu goes again towards the bullshit that um, bush is pulling

589
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,560
In you know in his last few days god, I can't wait till he's gone

590
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,440
Loki

591
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,200
Um fu to rude people at the stores, especially this time of year

592
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,800
Uh, there was some lady in front of us when we were trying to buy some

593
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,620
You know gifts and first off she's taking forever with her transaction

594
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,660
And kept wanting to you know, do idle chit chat and then when she was done

595
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:12,860
Uh, she sat there and started packing her crap into her purse for a good like three or four minutes

596
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:20,700
We're still waiting there trying to like get our shit done like the checkers already, you know running ourselves by and you know

597
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,540
She's just sitting there going, you know, trying to talk to the person stuff

598
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,060
I was like get the fuck out of my way you stupid whore

599
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:34,140
So a few rude people and then there's a ton of people can't drive correctly, especially now in the rain. So

600
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,700
Screw them, too

601
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,380
um, my a few of the week goes to the fact that i'm

602
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:47,020
Feeling pains in my side and I don't know if i'm just imagining it or if it's something weird happening again or what have you

603
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,460
I'll try to go to the doctor. Maybe it is my uterus. I don't know but you know

604
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,420
I don't know like I just get freaked out. It's been a hell of a year. I just want 2008 to go die in a fire

605
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,020
First of all, I would like to uh, tell the entire chat room

606
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:07,580
Don't wish assassination, you know, that's you're wishing murder on somebody however complete incapacitation of both bush and cheney

607
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:14,460
Would be fantastic if someone were to do that because that would put flossie in charge until obama takes over she is a speaker of the house

608
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,140
All right. I want to know uh, and my other a few goes to uh, selfish people

609
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,860
That's it

610
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:28,380
All right, in uh early 2009, we'll be receiving a brand new game

611
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:36,300
From the creator of such wonderful games as katamari damasi and all the other sequels. Um,

612
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,820
Takahashi, um is releasing nobi nobi boy on the playstation network and

613
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,700
They had a few videos that came out this week for it and I still don't know what the hell this game's about

614
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,060
It's like you're this stretchy thing that

615
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,500
Tries to hook a bunch of things up with your body and I don't know what exactly that's supposed to be for

616
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,700
But apparently, uh, you can stretch your body

617
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
You can devour things

618
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,740
I'm not really sure what exactly you do, but it's supposed to be coming out in japan

619
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,940
on january 29th for 800 yen

620
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:16,380
And uh the us probably around the same time so early 2009

621
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,860
But man, this game is weird and it's not like that trailer that we saw. It's not 2d at all. It's just

622
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,060
Weird well, you know, we did say that katamari damashi was weird, right?

623
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:32,140
Yeah, but this looks really weird like even like katamari. I you know, you could watch a trailer and get it

624
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,820
You know, you just oh you roll over things and your ball gets bigger this is like it's giant tube thing eating things and

625
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,140
Tying things up with its body

626
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,940
I don't get what the point is. That sounds fantastic. It's like

627
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:49,340
Bizarro snake it is like a bizarro snake. It's like, you know, everyone's like all happy and stuff and he starts eating people

628
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,380
And it's like oh my god. This isn't good at all eating people is great

629
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,060
Nom nom nom. Nobby. Nobby's made of people. It's good

630
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:07,840
Hey little big planet got some updates this week. You got two patches back to back 1.06 and 1.07

631
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:14,960
1.06 now it uh, it upgraded the moderation feature of the game, which a lot of people would say was badly needed

632
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,560
Now your unpublished levels can be edited by creators. They will not be erased for Evers and believe it or not

633
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,960
You'll now get an explanation when your level is moderated. Tadaa!

634
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,600
Finally after all that bitching and moaning some updates to the moderation

635
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,120
1.07 was also a good one. It was a good one. It was a good one. It was a good one

636
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:43,200
1.07 was also released like almost back-to-back this week and now you can actually find user-created levels a lot easier

637
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,560
Apparently the cool levels has a different algorithm. So it's not just a bunch of trophy whoring levels anymore

638
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,960
Which is kind of cool. I actually went in there and looked and it actually

639
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,400
It was some different stuff in there, which is kind of cool. And now they've also added the little big store

640
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,680
Kind of like how they added the store and rock band a little later on

641
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,520
Well now they have a another world that you go into. Well, it's it's still earth

642
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,320
but it shows the little pictures of little suits and other things that you have yet to buy and

643
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,680
Confirms which stuff you have already purchased for the game. So that's kind of cool and also very cool

644
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,760
You know, they I know a medium molecule and Sony in general took a lot of shit for the moderation

645
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,960
It's nice that they are making attempts to fix it. Thank you

646
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,120
What?

647
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,800
This is just what?

648
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,240
What?

649
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,440
I clicked on the link in the chat room. Uh-huh that was

650
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,560
Uh posted by tiger claw, uh, which I think we're covering later in the show. Okay, then never mind. Yeah

651
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,000
That's what I get

652
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,560
Well, how about some different news about sing star?

653
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:47,360
they're doing wireless microphones that will be out next year and um

654
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,360
They're uh

655
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,240
Actually, uh saying that there's going to be a hundred uh trial packs also

656
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,320
available to

657
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,200
Uh, I guess just a number of different sing star

658
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
followers on their myspace

659
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,020
But the packs are going to be two wireless microphones usb receiver

660
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,960
a mini b usb cable and four double a batteries

661
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,040
so

662
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,320
Like I want one for sing star abba, which by the way

663
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,320
There is now a sing star abba theme in the playstation network store that you can download for your ps3

664
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,880
What that you I don't know we know it all yet, but you know, it's coming out next year

665
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,480
What here that's coming out also in europe or may have already come out what sing star queen?

666
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,320
Oh cool. I heard about things. I heard there was there was a queen one coming out

667
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,040
I'm, totally gonna buy that in the us now. Awesome

668
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,160
That is exciting because queen is all sorts of awesome queen is very awesome

669
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,160
Oh, it's gonna have the videos and everything. I bet huh? So rub. What is your favorite queen?

670
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,440
That's gonna be amazing. You know, I have to stick with the old um

671
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,440
uh, bohemian rhapsody, but

672
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,400
I do have a big love for bicycle

673
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,720
What about you matt?

674
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:09,040
Uh, bohemian rhapsody and no one or was it a no one wants to live forever. I think my favorites would be um

675
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,760
Um somebody to love that's my favorite of all time. And oh, that's a great song. My second is killer queen

676
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,240
These are all good songs. I can't wait for this game. That's gonna be amazing

677
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,960
You know, the only thing that would be better would be sing star journey, you know, I had to say it sing star heart

678
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,400
See now it would only be good. I think that these are just a queen pack for a rock band. So that'd be a lot better

679
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,600
Yeah

680
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
They do need to have sing star butt rock

681
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,800
That would be amazing. It's poison and motley crew

682
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,760
and uh

683
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:46,320
That would be sweet. Uh, and I have to have cinderella and dakken and night ranger

684
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
And night ranger

685
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,280
And dan yankees because of ted nugent well other things

686
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:01,840
Nugent everything's awesome. And also from sony, uh pots upon two is um out in japan right now

687
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,920
But it will be coming

688
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,060
to other regions in early 2009

689
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,520
february and probably north america and um

690
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,720
Yeah pot upon is actually pretty cool. I didn't get to play a lot of the game. I just kind of gave up on it

691
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,720
After a while, but it was fun

692
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,120
Definitely unique little game and you know, i'd like to see more in that crazy style

693
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,160
But i'd also like to see it like on other systems, you know, I don't want to have to always bring out the psp to play this

694
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,580
Port that shit because it'd look awesome on the ps3

695
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:40,500
Because it'd look awesome on the ps3 pata pata pata would it it was a very interesting little game

696
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,620
Rob i'm cold. It would be even better

697
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,340
a heater if the buttons um

698
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,900
Spelled out or sung out of damn yankees songs. That'd be great

699
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,820
I

700
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:59,540
Hate everything about your mother. That wasn't damn yankees. No, I oh i'm thinking that was ugly kid joe. I'm, sorry

701
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:04,020
I'm thinking uh high enough was damn yankees, wasn't it? Because it's fucking ted nugent

702
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:11,140
Ted nugent eats meat and shoots guns. I like this man

703
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,740
Uh, all right, I saw him on tv skinning a deer

704
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,540
Ted nugent's fucking hot

705
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,860
Uh, unfortunately won't be able to skin a deer a little big planet, but

706
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,140
You will get paint guns, which is kind of cool. I mean

707
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:34,260
I do have a challenge out there for you folks to make a level where you do skin a deer. You can probably do that

708
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,460
I have to actually I have to go back to ronma

709
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,100
Queens ryke is the shit

710
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:47,060
Although you misspelled it because queens the lead singer of queens ryke is a trained opera singer and he's just got this fantastic voice

711
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:51,460
Anyway, i'm sorry. That's right. I would like to see um sack boy's house of blood in um

712
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:57,780
Um in little big planet. I want to see some really I did disturbing levels one time and I I just never got around to

713
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:03,460
Actually trying to make anything in this game, but you know thought about it making a saw themed level

714
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,780
But you know, I couldn't figure out how I could

715
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,420
You know do that

716
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:13,140
I don't know. Well, maybe some of the new items in the metal gear solid pack will help you because yeah

717
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,580
They're getting paint guns

718
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:19,060
Um now apparently you're going to get a paintball gun that you can use to actually shoot down enemies and all this stuff

719
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:24,580
Apparently trophies are being added go figure like 11 trophies are being added in this pack

720
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:31,540
But here's what I don't understand about this is that I I was assuming that the metal gear solid thing was for users to create levels

721
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,940
But it is but so why?

722
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,940
Why then are there these new trophies because shouldn't I get to play it still if somebody else makes the level using it?

723
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,540
Or am I going to get locked out? Here's the thing

724
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,820
This level pack you're downloading you get

725
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:50,900
It's a level and then you get objects including this paintball gun from the plane that level and there's trophies tied in with

726
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,860
The few levels that are there basically the levels are to teach you how to use the paintball gun because

727
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,820
The paintball gun is going to allow you to make shooter games now

728
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:04,020
They're going to have objects that will detect how many hits with the paintball gun before they are destroyed

729
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:08,820
Also remember before how people were trying to create objects that like shot bullets and stuff

730
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:16,180
Well, now they have some sort of like energy blast things that come out of them. It's a new sort of like damaging object

731
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,500
That's going to be available and you'll get all those by playing through levels

732
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:25,300
So that's gonna be awesome then it that is a very major download

733
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:30,260
Instant purchase from me. I'm also well. I'm happy to hear the media molecule is doing some of this

734
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:37,060
Themselves because the levels they did were some of the best honestly they really really were it it was a very

735
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:43,220
They really really were it it looks really cool. I mean it if you watch the trailer for it very very cool looking

736
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:47,780
Yeah, I do watch the trailer. It looks very cute. I just didn't understand how it worked a little bit contra

737
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:53,060
Well now I understand well, hey now this is also kind of neat is that they're also getting some level packs not just for this

738
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,460
But they I guess this just came out this past week

739
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,580
Um, I don't remember seeing it on the store, but I didn't really look very hard

740
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:03,560
Um, the holiday pack is now apparently out. It was supposed to come out december 18th for 299

741
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:11,660
and uh, it's the festive level pack and it's supposed to contain two new costumes some new material new objects six new decorations

742
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:18,520
And tons and tons of tons of new stickers, but however, um with this pack levels themselves are not apparently included

743
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,960
So, but they just have the stickers though. Yeah

744
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,640
So I guess you put this in your own levels or what have you because you can create new, you know

745
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,880
Christmas tree looking things and you know everything with the stickers. Hey speaking of stickers

746
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,880
When are we going to get that feature where I can uh put photos from the hard drive into the game?

747
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,600
Because that's that's the other big thing we're waiting on

748
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,500
But it was in an advertisement. It's false advertising

749
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,200
bitch wine moan

750
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,360
Right, you're never going to get it

751
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,840
I wish maybe next year. We'll see

752
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,480
Well, this is something that's pretty cool. Um

753
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:57,800
You know, uh on xbox live there was the um, super street fighter 2 turbo hd remix

754
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,440
well, um

755
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,360
It's uh sold a quarter million. Wow. There's a lot of suckers out there

756
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,560
Well, I I have it. I like it. I've got so many different versions of street fighters. Not even funny

757
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,640
That's 250 000 people sucking the cock of nostalgia. It's

758
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,920
It's basically broken both day one and week one sales records

759
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,160
and um

760
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,200
Is uh slated to break 30-day sale records as well. So it's supposed to be the the um

761
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,720
Oh, actually according to capcom. It's quoted as saying it's honest way to becoming the highest grossing digital title ever

762
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,800
Besides that they had the good sense to use udon crew to do their art. So that's pretty cool

763
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,680
Very cool they didn't sell one to me

764
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,840
well

765
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:47,720
Unfortunately this week there aren't that many choices for you to go purchase stuff. I mean it is

766
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:54,440
the week of christmas and a lot of game publishers aren't exactly putting their games out this week because uh,

767
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:01,720
That's not a lot of time to purchase them. But there are a few that are putting out their games and um, well

768
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,080
They're games. All right, um

770
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:19,000

Man talk about a short week mystery pi portrait of a thief on ds

775
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:41,160
And I swear that I think that's it that is it that is sad

776
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:50,680
Well, it is kind of a quiet week as well over in japan because they usually get new releases on thursday and what's thursday

777
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,680
Oh, yeah christmas

But it's on the wii and I can't figure out like is this the old school?

791
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,920
Resident evil being redone because I don't think it's resident evil 4

792
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:08,760
It must be like from redone port of the first game or something. Uh peakman gets its wii upgrade this week as well

793
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,280
Or pickman peakman, whatever. Uh, maybe that's that biohazard zero

Because i'm like totally excited to play it. They're like

808
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,760

Yeah

813
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:48,280
It's just not a big week in games. I I reckon not. All right. Well, there you have it

814
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:53,240
We have to do the release dates no matter what even if it's slow week and don't expect next week to be much better

815
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,200
Because it's not

816
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:02,520
But you know, it is uh, pretty big the text in banjo kazooie now because uh,

817
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,480
There's that brand new patch for those people that own the 14-inch

818
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,520
standard definition

819
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
You know tube tvs

820
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:15,560
You now can read your text in banjo kazooie and suffer through the dialogue of that game

821
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:23,880
So, um, well, thank heavens because you know, I was just waiting for the no, I actually I was just

822
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,680
you know, I was just waiting for the no, I actually a lot of people really were waiting for something like this to come out because

823
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:35,000
If you play it on the small tv, this game's next to impossible to play. I'm spoiled with my hd tv. So I need to just

824
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,720
Stop taunting those that don't have it

825
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,560
Correct. Yeah. All right. Yes. All right. Well, um, we're just about to the end of part a tonight

826
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,220
But hey, we've got to uh, take some time to recognize

827
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:53,180
Gaming's classics and that's what we do here in a segment. We call the classic game of the week

828
00:59:53,740 --> 01:00:00,400
Oh dark sakura, what have you picked for this very special holiday week for the kids and uh adults out there to recognize?

829
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:07,820
This week in gaming i've picked a bit of the nes and uh, commodore 64 for you. Rob

830
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,260
Yay, joy in the form of maniac mansion

831
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,260
Maniac mansion

832
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,140
Maniac mansion is a weird little game

833
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,700
This music's from the nes version yeah

834
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:32,780
But it was originally on the commodore 64 so where um

835
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,900
It actually uh is the game that the uh

836
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:43,260
Scum engine was created for the script creation utility for maniac mansion

837
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:50,700
And lucas arts used it for about uh, 10 more years to keep playing it. It also um has chuck the plant in it

838
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:56,460
If anyone has looked at other lucas arts games that that character's in but anyway as the game goes, um

839
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,140
There was a purple meteor that made a big crater

840
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:06,060
um on the line of this big mansion that belonged to the edison family and um

841
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:12,620
So basically there were changes in the people that lived there and then uh people that were in uh

842
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,620
the

843
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:21,340
Hospital started disappearing. So then there were a bunch of people who uh decided to go into the house because

844
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:27,660
A local cheerleader turned up missing and they decided to go through the entire house, which is like this big

845
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,540
movie type horror

846
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,620
house thing with um

847
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,580
Tentacles and an evil genius and the pool

848
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:43,660
The pool is the best part it has different multi- it has you know multiple endings you can go through depends on who lives who dies

849
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:50,300
You can have a you know, a perfect ending you can have the adversary win you can have um

850
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:55,660
You can have them famous by publishing his autobiography. You can feed them to a plant

851
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:01,740
Um, and um, you can you know, get your players in the game killed and um,

852
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,820
it has different red herrings in it and um

853
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:14,140
Just kind of different weird stuff in the game. Um, the different characters in there is you have the sort of

854
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:19,020
James dean type character you have a new wave musician

855
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,820
You have a photographer

856
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:29,100
You have a novelist. Um, you have a big nerd who's uh, really scary. YAY NERD!

857
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:32,860
You've got um a punk rock girl

858
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,080
You've got um a surfer in there. They all have their different strengths and weaknesses

859
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,860
and um

860
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:44,780
I've played this of course on the nes because that's what I had. Um

861
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:49,900
The uh, the different versions there were there were there were

862
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,660
the uh, the different versions there were there was also a pc

863
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,900
that um

864
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,340
also, uh

865
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,340
played um

866
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:04,220
There's also the apple 2 the amiga and atari st versions

867
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:10,220
Um, there was the nes versions and instead of it being the full size. They were all kind of sd

868
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,940
Super deformed, you know the different characters

869
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,420
um

870
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:22,300
And there is actually um an enhanced version with updated graphics that's out and it had a sitcom based on the series

871
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,460
Do you ever remember watching? Oh, yeah, I remember that. Oh god, that wasn't on very long

872
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:30,300
But yeah, I remember there was this game was pretty big when it came out and there was a fan

873
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:36,860
Um remake that's called maniac mansion deluxe that runs on windows. Um, the has really

874
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:44,140
um enhanced graphics and music that was actually borrowed from day of the tentacle and um

875
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,540
it supposed to fix a lot of uh,

876
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:53,660
Bugs and inconsistencies and they put in some different changes to make it a little bit harder. It's also playable in day of the tentacle

877
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,540
maniac mansion

878
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:03,100
Um, and of course then there was it was really really centered though on the nes there were a lot of stuff changed

879
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,900
um

880
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:10,220
There um was only one printing of the game

881
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,780
um

882
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:19,020
They actually did forget to leave in though some of the more bloody parts like you could still microwave the hamster

883
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,460
awesome

884
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:27,740
But the pal version does not have the ability to microwave the hamster. Oh

885
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,420
The guy though who um

886
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,980
That ported it douglas, uh crockford

887
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:39,340
Put out a memoir that was called the expurgation of maniac mansion

888
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,780
Which was, you know, basically him going oh god nintendo you suck

889
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:49,900
um about how strict nintendo was for what they could allow in the game what they couldn't and um

890
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:58,780
About you know some things that he agreed with taking out like edna, you know having sexually themed threats to the characters

891
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,500
and different things, um

892
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:06,220
Including the you know, the use of violence non-violence and that type of thing

893
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,220
That type of thing

894
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:10,380
um

895
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,660
So, um, it was pretty pretty uh

896
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,860
Heavily centered like I said, um

897
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,500
also, um

898
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,580
There like I was saying before it was my favorite part of the game

899
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,820
Whenever I would just get really tired of playing it and go to hell with this

900
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:32,220
I would go to the pool drain it and push the red button so that the house would explode

901
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,220
I

902
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:40,300
Just what I did every time I was like i'm tired of playing explode game over

903
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:47,900
I didn't think the graphics on the nes version were that great compared to the computer one. No

904
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,540
Which is strange because i'm talking about a game on the commodore 64, but

905
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:59,260
The commodore 64 version was actually really nice. I personally did not play it, but I have seen it played

906
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,320
Um, because like I said, I didn't have a commodore 64

907
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:08,940
I had a clicko adam. I have to say though as far as this type of game goes on the nes

908
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,780
There is a game. I do prefer these point-and-click games shadow gate

909
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,060
Shadow gate was great. Yeah, i'm talking you know

910
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:21,420
You know what part I would always get those stuck at was where you went into the the portal and you had a limited time

911
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,020
with your um

912
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,260
You had to actually have like some item to make it through the portal

913
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:30,300
You're gonna need to do that in a future week. I'm gonna have to I actually never finished shadow gate, but I love shadow gate

914
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:32,460
but um

915
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:36,620
It's just interesting because you don't think about these point-and-click games a lot on the nes because they they you know

916
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,620
But there were some really good ones

917
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,740
But um, yeah this it's a really good one, you know also, uh

918
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,940
There's some of the uh, lucas arts, uh, i'm just looking at the list of the different lucas arts, uh

919
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:53,580
Um titles that they were supposed to go along with the scum engine

920
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:58,780
And let me get back to that because I was just on it. It was um, I think a couple of monkey island games

921
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,820
and uh labyrinth and loom

922
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:09,020
And I think i've covered loom before which is strange because I think loom came out before maniac mansion didn't it?

923
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,580
Uh, no, it was after no, no, it was after

924
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,780
Strange it was after monkey island even I think

925
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:22,460
But yeah, um some uh, and actually, uh, one of the salmon max games was supposed to use it, but they uh, canceled it

926
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,940
It was a salmon max freelance police

927
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,220
And full throttle payback was another one

928
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:35,920
But yeah, um some of the different ones that used it was uh, monkey island 2 lachuck's revenge and indiana jones and the fate of atlantis

929
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,460
So well there you have it

930
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:45,020
If there's nothing else to add then your classic game of the week is blow up the house

931
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,060
maniac mansion on the

932
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:55,260
Maniac mansion on the nes or commodore 64 whatever system you prefer maniac mansion

933
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,420
And don't forget to drain the water for the pool and blow up the house

934
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,900
That's dark soccer's favorite thing to do, correct?

935
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,980
Indeed

936
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:02,860
All right

937
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:07,500
Well, uh, we're going to take a quick break here on orange lounge radio and do some music here

938
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:12,860
And uh when we come back we have plenty more actually, sorry the podcast folks. You won't get to hear the music

939
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,940
That's just the way it is, you know copyright rules and everything

940
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:18,620
But uh, we'll be back really soon with more of orange launch radio more stories

941
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:23,740
Hopefully a little bit happier than all the layoff stories we had in uh part a do you think we can arrange that low-key get?

942
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,700
Some happier stuff in part. Maybe tonight. All right, we'll try

943
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,140
Um, meanwhile, we're gonna go ahead and take a break and we will be right back

944
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:41,580
And welcome back to more of orange lounge radio and this part b of our podcast for this december the 21st

945
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:46,160
Of 2008 and uh, happy holidays to you guys out there listening to the program

946
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:51,440
Uh, we talked a lot about uh different things going on in part a unfortunately a lot of really not so happy

947
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,680
Holidays going on for a lot of folks in the game industry

948
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:59,040
And i'm ready to hear that. Uh, we talked also about some other um news including um,

949
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:05,920
Some sales stuff about uh, hg remix and some little big planet updates and some other news coming to the sony world

950
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:12,160
But now we're going to move in and start off tonight talking a little bit about microsoft in part b. Yes, logy. Yes, we are

951
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:18,980
Not exactly great news, but uh microsoft has announced that fable 2's expansion

952
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,680
Um, nahole island

953
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:29,140
Not coming out for christmas. Unfortunately, uh was due out this week. It is now being delayed to the end of january

954
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:35,080
Still going to be 10 bucks. Apparently they ran into some unexpected technical difficulties

955
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:40,020
At least they didn't call it balloon nahole island. I mean that would have been really bad

956
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,700
Just saying that would be horrible

957
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:52,100
It's why why the delay, um unexpected technical difficulties, whatever that's supposed to mean

958
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:58,260
Uh, everyone took some time off for the holidays. I still don't think it's a good name to name it nahole island

959
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,260
anyways, it just

960
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:04,980
Makes me think of like a glory hole or well, haven't you ever heard of what a balloon knot is?

961
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:13,300
That's supposed to be like an asshole because you know what a balloon knot looks like an asshole exactly and this one house in san diego

962
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:22,100
And every time I hear not whole island I keep thinking of a balloon knot hole and it's disgusting i'm like who wants to visit an island

963
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:27,140
With a bunch of assholes. There's a house in san diego that looks like a sphincter

964
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,260
Make all the gay jokes you want, but that does not sound appealing. I'm, sorry

965
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,980
So there you have it

966
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:37,060
Anyway

967
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:44,340
I'm sorry, i'll move on i'm trying to eat a bagel while i'm talking and making jokes. I need to stop eating cookies

968
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,140
Uh tiger claw says every time I hear not whole i'm thinking of sonic am

969
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,940
Uh moving on

970
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:59,720
Eight hundred point microsoft point cards now have made their way into the retail marketplace

971
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:06,500
um, apparently, um, you know, you could only get 1600 microsoft points before it was 1999, but now

972
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:10,440
You can get 800 microsoft point cards at retailers for 9.99

973
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:15,620
And hey, that would be one whole cent cheaper than buying them online. Oh, but you have to pay tax

974
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,740
So you're screwed then you have to consider this tax

975
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:24,900
So it's good if you don't like if you want to give a gift or if like, you know, you don't have a credit card

976
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,660
And you're a little kid

977
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,180
or

978
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:31,620
Or you want to buy it as a gift, but you know, it's it's a stocking stuffer

979
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,660
So maybe 20 bucks is too much. I don't know just buy it online

980
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:40,340
Yeah, I guess you know what I want, but they don't world peace. No not world peace screw world peace. Um,

981
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:48,100
But they're not available in most stores is those playstation network cards because I hate the playstation network and how they do their

982
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,900
Payments online. Yeah, it's a little silly. I don't like it by the way

983
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:55,940
speaking of playstation network because you brought it up and I forgot to mention earlier in the show we talked about playstation home last week

984
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,140
And I said I was going to get an olr club as soon as they open it up

985
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,940
Well, I guess I missed it because I went back online later in the week and I saw where you could buy a clubhouse online

986
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,220
It was just hard to find

987
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:11,300
Um, i'm not interested in it because you have to invite people into the club and you can only invite up to like 30 people

988
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,620
What kind of an olr club is that?

989
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,180
Not a cool one, unfortunately, I know we have more than 30 people in our chat room tonight

990
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,100
We probably would have more people now than what I do

991
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,420
I thought it was something that people would be able to search and go into you know at their leisure

992
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:29,940
But I don't see how it's promotion for the show to do that. It sounds stupid then I'd have to buy all the furniture

993
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,940
So forget it

994
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:38,180
Until home gets cooler. I protest. Sorry. Well, there are probably only about 30 of our listeners that actually have a playstation three

995
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:40,260
Yeah, true true

996
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:45,140
Sj100 matt in our chat room wants to point out. Um, I see psn cards in best buy

997
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,860
Entertainment says not only that clubs cost money fail. I was willing to like for five bucks

998
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:56,020
I would have done it like it's an experiment. How much was it five bucks five bucks? Okay. Yeah, and I'm still considering it

999
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:02,180
Here right now. It's five bucks with no re no reoccurring fee, but sony is going to implement them at some point

1000
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:06,100
You just didn't say what like home doesn't suck enough

1001
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:11,140
Do now do we have the trophy rooms and stuff like remember how they're saying? No, nope

1002
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:17,300
So like most things it's extremely early like most sony will get i'm sure home will be better in a year

1003
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:23,220
But by then we will have all forgot home is extremely late as it is. It's no time for being early. It's late

1004
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:25,220
It's

1005
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:32,580
Just saying I know all right, sorry we can go back to um, um other stuff now, sorry jamie, okay

1006
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,460
sega

1007
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:39,780
What about them? Well, it looks like um, there's been some esrb, uh

1008
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:47,860
Ratings put out so that means that they're going to be a number of games on um xbox live and playstation network from sega

1009
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:51,620
There will be um, a sonic 3 comic zone

1010
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:54,900
fantasy star 2 and gun star heroes, whoo-hoo

1011
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:58,260
which are uh supposed to be uh

1012
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,580
Out and then um, there were I guess other releases. Um

1013
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:10,260
I'm, sorry, uh, the previous releases were sonic the hedgehog sonic 2 golden axe and echo the dolphin and streets of rage 2

1014
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:17,860
Wait a minute, but isn't sega putting out that thing of like 40 games for like 20 bucks or something. Yes

1015
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:22,420
Yes, do you think that sega wants as much money as possible? Yes, okay

1016
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,860
Say yeah, are they giving me anything special?

1017
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,340
with this

1018
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:33,860
I guess and they're going to give you the option to blur it out so that it looks all like, you know hd like

1019
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,960
Seems kind of just buy the 20 thing when it comes out. Seriously

1020
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,140
Unless they're not i'm, sorry

1021
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,780
Which I highly doubt that they are all right, we'll see what happens

1022
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:49,540
Something else coming to xbox live arcade kind of interesting

1023
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:55,800
I'm, not sure a lot of people are familiar with the um, mmorpg dofus

1024
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:59,380
They have a uh

1025
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:06,820
Game, I think it's called uh wok fu and now the islands of wok fu are going to be coming to xbox live arcade

1026
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:08,820
So it's like an mmo

1027
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:15,140
But not you know, it's got the mmo graphics. I guess the perfect example would be like ragnarok online ds

1028
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:20,100
You know where it's not technically an mmo game, but you play it similar to the mmo

1029
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:25,300
It's just you're not going to be interacting with other people. In fact, that's the tagline. It's like an mmo, but not

1030
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:33,700
But um, yeah, it's apparently set a hundred years or a thousand years after wok fu it's due

1031
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,940
Uh late 2009 and will be an adventure beat them up title

1032
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:44,580
As an adventure beat them up and venture beat them up as adventure slash beat them up all style game

1033
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:53,540
It says it can be played in a two-player team mode and uh will reveal never before seen background content from the world of dofus

1034
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,100
and wok fu

1035
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:02,740
Really because to me the entire world of dofus and wok fu are unseen and I have not played either one

1036
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:08,180
But hey, it's a different type of game and that's always welcome bochi kawa in chat asks wok fu

1037
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,340
Is that like beating people senseless with a frying pan?

1038
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,060
Yes, it is exactly now that would be a great game

1039
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,700
Go around and hit people with a frying pan. Actually, you can kind of do that little big planet. I just want to say

1040
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,260
uh, hey talking about um

1041
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:28,020
Hey other things we might want to hit in the head with a frying pan is uh, whoever caused those xbox 360 discs to scratch

1042
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:33,620
Apparently there's some lawsuits going on right now. You know, we reported on those a while ago, but now they're just finally getting around to you know

1043
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:39,700
Being looked at investigated what have you and a document in one of the suits was actually unsealed last week

1044
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:45,300
Apparently my and what it contains in it is that microsoft actually knew about the problem prior to launch

1045
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:49,620
They have multiple options to fix it and the company rejected all of them

1046
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:54,020
There were three options apparently listed in the document one of them was a

1047
01:16:54,020 --> 01:17:00,100
To increase the magnetic field of the disc holder and the reason why they decided to reject that is because it would get in the way

1048
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:05,060
Of the disc opening and closing thing. Um, but here's here's where I go crazy when I read that

1049
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:09,300
My 360 is having issues when I try to open and close the door on it right now

1050
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:14,260
Like sometimes i'll have to hit the button multiple times and i'm starting to worry that the damn thing's about to break on me

1051
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:16,260
Have you heard of anything like that loki?

1052
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:18,820
no, but I know that the way they have the

1053
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:25,620
Eject button and also the um, like power switch and stuff. It's really funky like the power switch

1054
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:29,700
There's a little button that's off center on it. So if you push it in the center of your

1055
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:34,580
Face plate it won't exactly trigger it every time you kind of push to the right of it

1056
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:39,300
So and the way the eject button works is kind of similar

1057
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:44,340
It's a little push button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out, but it's kind of like a push button switch

1058
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:49,700
It's kind of like a push button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out, but you know

1059
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:56,100
You can always if you can't get it to eject that way just you know, hit the middle button and select eject disc

1060
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:01,700
Great jrod in chat says I used to have to do that and it ended up where the disk drive wouldn't read anymore

1061
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,700
lovely

1062
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:08,420
Um, remember they won't warranty unless it read rings. So that's when you take a blow torch to it

1063
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,980
Well, look, there's some other options too

1064
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:16,580
The other options were to slow down the disc rotation speed but that was rejected because it would have slowed down the game loading times

1065
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,260
I think we can understand that one

1066
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:23,940
uh, and then um, apparently the other option was to install little bumpers that would have cost the company between

1067
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:30,260
35 to 75 million additional dollars, but I would think little bumpers wouldn't that be like maybe like a buck?

1068
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,500
a machine

1069
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,220
Yes, it's it's literally that little um

1070
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:40,100
They had a fix a long time ago when people were ready to scratch thing that was available online

1071
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,100
You'd buy these little um

1072
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:46,660
It looked like a cd and you would put it in the drive and kind of push it up and it would stick little

1073
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:53,060
Pads on there that would you know keep the disc from jiggling because basically what happens is since the disc has so much play

1074
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:59,300
Inside the drive it'll end up, you know bending back to where it rubs up against the laser and that's what carves a nice little

1075
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:02,260
You know circle into your disc

1076
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:06,660
So this what these do is allows it so that the other side

1077
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:10,260
Doesn't tip as much so doesn't ever make contact with the laser

1078
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:17,380
Well, here's the thing is that um the and the big thing that the document shows is that microsoft what they eventually decided to do

1079
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:21,860
They appended the manual with a warning and offered a disc replacement program

1080
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:26,900
You know that was their big fix and I believe something about like a sticker on the door too that you have to pull off

1081
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,900
That warns them not to tilt the machine when you play

1082
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:34,340
Apparently this was deemed insufficient by company employees via an internal email

1083
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:37,860
But it's apparently what happened. Anyway, well, it is kind of I mean

1084
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:46,900
It's a stupid fix and really they should have just added those little bumpers to it because it wouldn't have cost them 75 million dollars

1085
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:52,980
I mean how many consoles they have out there? They have like almost fifteen thousand, you know, fifteen million consoles or not

1086
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:56,180
Even really that many but like over ten million consoles. Okay, so

1087
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:01,700
You know, they're saying seventy five million dollars. So that's seven fifty per console

1088
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:05,860
Um, or no, that's 75 million. That'd be 75 cents per console, basically

1089
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,900
so

1090
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:13,700
Or no my math's all wrong today. Well act whatever it doesn't matter either way

1091
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:18,820
It's not gonna cost that much act up in chat says but who the fuck moves around a console when playing a game really?

1092
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:25,620
Well, some people own pets like my cat who likes to jump on consoles and um,

1093
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,780
You know, she may knock it over luckily

1094
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:33,380
I'm smart enough to know if the cat's nearby the console. I will lay it flat on the ground instead of you know

1095
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:36,340
Tipping up and that's you know, that's a rare occasion, you know, or

1096
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:41,220
We just took ours away where she can't get to it. Yeah, I mean it's someone can bump it

1097
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:46,260
You know a court get pulled or something knock the console over. I mean, there's all sorts of stuff that can happen

1098
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:51,540
It's rare, but there are cases though. I've been hearing where people's discs are just getting in a groove

1099
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,420
Carved into it just from leaving it

1100
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:59,380
Going it's just on you know, the way the laser moves or something that there's some

1101
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:04,660
Jittering in there that causes like a ring to kind of carved in over time

1102
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:09,700
Not necessarily like where people were tilting the console. It made a nice little like grinding noise

1103
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,780
Uh, gs68 says microsoft needs to fix the d-pad from hell agreed

1104
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:20,740
It's getting to the point where i'm actually considering buying like some games on the ps3 over the xbox 360 completely based on the controller

1105
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,620
completely based on the controller

1106
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:29,460
Completely based on the controller whatever happened to that controller that was supposedly coming out that had a better d-pad

1107
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:33,960
I never saw that and why they would do that for a limited amount of time is retarded

1108
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:40,180
That's a very good question. I I have no idea why they would do that. Uh, and tiger claw wants to say, um,

1109
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:41,940
Well, he says a couple things

1110
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:46,180
He says it's a conspiracy microsoft knew all along with the disk scratch problem before the public found out

1111
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:49,300
I smell a class action waiting to happen. Actually. It's already happening

1112
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:54,100
That's where these documents came out of but then he goes on to say microsoft needs to fix the tray eject problem

1113
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,740
A lot of people are experiencing it. I'm not the only one

1114
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:01,300
And bobby blackwolf wanted to work in a cheap plug for his upcoming new show

1115
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:07,540
He said the first episode of friday night gaming will address that issue directly on stage with a company that repairs consoles

1116
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:11,780
Apparently one little shtick they're going to do on their show is actually repair consoles live on air

1117
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:16,340
On his little friday night show he's starting I believe the 9th of january is the first episode

1118
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:20,660
Straight out straight out of atlanta or I have a console that's under repairables

1119
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:26,180
What because i've tried repairing it really remember that should be a challenge that I took a heat gun to you

1120
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:33,380
Should see if bobby will take it on bobby and his friends. It can be fixed. I'm sure if they re-bulb the um GPU on it, but

1121
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:39,700
I don't have the device to do it. Let alone the patience or the skill necessary

1122
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:43,780
It's gonna be like trauma center for consoles. That's gonna be amazing

1123
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,780
So check that out

1124
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:47,780
friday night

1125
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:51,780
Fnglive.net if I don't say the website then bobby will say I hate him. All right

1126
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:57,780
Let's move on with more news. We'll see what happens in further developments with the uh disc scratching

1127
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,780
Oh, hey, no, we're not gonna move on with more news

1128
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:05,780
We don't want to do any more news. We're done. We're out of here. Have a great night everybody. Bye. All right

1129
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,780
No, just kidding. Uh, we're gonna open your emails now. That's what we're doing

1130
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:13,780
Uh, we're gonna open your emails now. That's what we're doing mailbag at orange lounge radio.com

1131
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:18,580
And dark soccer likes to read some of her favorite emails. Actually. She doesn't really like to do it

1132
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,580
She does it because she has to yep

1133
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:26,420
If we tell her that if she does not read the emails on air that she will not be given beer anymore

1134
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,100
So mailbag orange lunch radio.com. Let's read some of those emails

1135
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,300
Um, hey, olr. This is amay satsuma

1136
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:38,420
My question to you is if you were able to throw an object at someone what would that object be?

1137
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,820
And who would you throw it at must be non-lethal?

1138
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:45,140
Does this have something to do with the bush shoe thing this week it must

1139
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:48,340
Um, I actually would

1140
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:52,100
If I could completely get away with it without you know

1141
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:57,460
Um the secret service trying to jump me or anything. I would throw something at bush

1142
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,340
um, I would throw um

1143
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:02,680
um, basically the uh

1144
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,320
Waste of a homeless person at him

1145
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:14,680
Feces no overall waste. Oh, okay. Yeah and say that it was his fault

1146
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,440
Um, but that's that's hypothetical that's not not that I would physically do that

1147
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,400
So i'm not breaking any sort of constitutional law by saying it would be cool if that were to happen

1148
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:32,840
But um, can I answer can I answer go for it, um that crazy messed up, uh, uh,

1149
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:39,320
Fags go to hell guy. What's that guy phelps phelps? Yes. I would like to throw a cream pie at him

1150
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,560
But what a waste of a yummy pie

1151
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,560
So I will throw um throw rainbow sparkles feces pie

1152
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,240
Here's some shit cake

1153
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:57,020
Here fred phelps have a shit cake what about I like that idea millions of dollars at myself

1154
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,840
That would mean you'd have to have it to throw it at yourself first

1155
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:07,720
No, I would have to have a million dollars in my hand, which means I would have acquired millions of dollars

1156
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,680
Win-win either way I have to look at it

1157
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:15,000
I like that. We've invented a new word on the show tonight shit cake. I like that

1158
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,880
I'm going to use that in a sentence three times this week shit cake

1159
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,520
Shit cake, shit cake, shit cake. Shut up and go eat shit cake

1160
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:26,520
Also last week you asked for christmas e-cards and I decided to make one since I stuck at photoshop

1161
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:32,120
I made it using this microsoft flash app that uses your 360 avatars. I hope you will enjoy it sat

1162
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:38,440
It's cute. It's it's the joker avatar in front of a fire. I think I saw that as a signature on another forum

1163
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,440
I thought it was funny

1164
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,680

Anyone heard anything about elder scrolls travels for psp?

1171
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,560
And do you really think there will be it not?

1172
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,500
T h e i r it should be t h e r e

1173
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:20,220
Well typing on a psp

1174
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,300
It doesn't matter spelling is spelling

1175
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:26,700
And also, um e and r are right next to each other e and i are not

1176
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:32,300
If it uses qwerty, um, and do you think that there will be a little big planet for psp?

1177
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:41,020
Hope you enjoy the song as much as I enjoy your show reese, uh, bc canada. My birthday is december 26

lol, 15 wu

1179
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,360
Um, yes on little big planet on the psp. I think that's inevitable at some point

1180
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,800
But that may not be done by media molecule, but I think sony will cash in on it

1181
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,240
Um, if it's not done by media molecule, i'm already worried. Um

1182
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,680
As far as the other games in 2009 god, what's coming out on psp in 2009? There's not a lot right now, right?

1183
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,040
No, there is

1184
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,400
Really? Yes

1185
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:08,480
Tell me some of the titles. I have to look forward to star ocean second. Um, we're the second star ocean games coming out

1186
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:14,560
Uh resistance retribution, uh, loco roko 2 pop the pond 2

1187
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,120
Uh, there's supposedly a motorstorm game and a little big planet game coming

1188
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,400
um

1189
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,400
Try anything else, uh monokina

1190
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,260
It's coming out on psp. Where's africa psp?

1191
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:33,200
So i'm gonna know where's africa ps3? That's true. Wasn't it supposed to be out by now?

1192
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,520
Yeah, they're picking up a national geographic license

1193
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,920
I was this close to importing it and I was like fuck that I can't run over the animals

1194
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:44,880
So I said no i'm not buying that uh, dissida when it comes out in english

1195
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:51,680
Yes, dissida will be coming out over here in the summer. Okay. God. I can't wait to play that. Um

1196
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:59,520
I don't know. It looks like a better year definitely because 2008 sucked and like you look at the releases

1197
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,120
There was just not a lot of releases period I mean there were some good ones

1198
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:09,760
I mean the midnight club la remix is supposed to be pretty good. Um, you know star ocean. The first one was pretty good

1199
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:17,680
I could go for some more of the final fantasy. Um ports to uh, the psp. That would be awesome. Like, uh, you know, maybe

1200
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,240
six

1201
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:25,440
Six would be nice. Did we get all the did we get all the questions in that email? I think we did. Oh, I zoned out

1202
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,640
Sorry

1203
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,640
Um, yeah, we did. All right

1204
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,400
um

1205
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:33,040
Moving on to the next email

1206
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:39,600
Um, I just thought I would update you folks as to what's going on regarding the situation with my stolen

1207
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,900
P uh ps3 this is from spazzinator

1208
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:44,320
Oh, yes

1209
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,040
He called in uh last week or the week before to mention it

1210
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:51,360
It got stolen and he wanted us to kind of put out the word for all our fans in buffalo

1211
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,360
Of which I don't know how many we have but we tried

1212
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,120
To date the buffalo police have not done anything about it and let's face it

1213
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:02,720
Unless the ps3 was jelly filled or covered in sprinkles. They aren't likely to look for it. Frankly. I have no faith in them

1214
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,480
My counseling agency has been has been helpful as a wet fart read. Not at all

1215
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:14,160
You'd think that since the theft occurred there that they'd be eager to have this issue resolved just to cover their collective asses

1216
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,000
but it looks like

1217
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
that isn't the case as

1218
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,080
Oh, I lost my place actually as a related note

1219
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:27,920
And if I neither mentioned it in the call, or you haven't figured it out already. I bought my ps

1220
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:34,420
I brought my ps3 to my counseling agency for an informal party. I was supplying the entertainment movies downloaded on psn

1221
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:37,840
karaoke rock band guitar hero world tour style

1222
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:45,600
Etc. It was stolen between 12 15 p.m. And 1 15. Um p.m. Est. Wouldn't that be am

1223
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:52,800
Um, oh no, i'm misreading it on uh est on 11 19 when it was unattended in all likelihood

1224
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,280
I won't be getting my original system back, which is a shame

1225
01:29:55,600 --> 01:30:02,080
I had the 60 gigabyte model which are impossible to find not only that but I upgraded the internal. Um htd

1226
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:10,800
And bought a ton of stuff off of the psn store anywho luckily my ssi payee is sitting on my rainy day fund

1227
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,560
And sent her request for the adequate funds to replace the system with a used 80 gigabyte model

1228
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,720
And the same type of upgraded hdd that I had before i'll worry about the movies and tv shows that I bought at a later

1229
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:29,120
Time and date. Sorry for the long as hell email. Trust me. It's not and I figured that you'd appreciate an update. Take care

1230
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:36,000
Well, thanks for letting us know well stolen systems suck and whoever stole your system needs to die in a fire and let's just hope

1231
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,800
That karma comes around and bites this person in their big fat ass

1232
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,440
Next email next email j-rod

1233
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,360
Hey folks

1234
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:48,260
I haven't heard the last show but I don't know if this has been asked if it has please disregard

1235
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,680
But if you could ask santa for one gaming related christmas present and don't worry about price santa is bringing it

1236
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:59,280
What would it be mine would be a new computer to play left for dead because I can't even run the original halo

1237
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:03,780
This email is sponsored by the olive garden home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks

1238
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,880
you first

1239
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,040
Um, I don't know if it's gaming related, but I would like a new computer

1240
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,320
Well, see I have a new computer for the gaming but I would just like a whole new like setup for the show

1241
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,560
I'd like like a fancy new mix board

1242
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,520
Um an easier way to publish a show on a faster computer without having to transfer to my new one

1243
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,320
Which has kind of been slowing things down technically gaming related. Um, I technically because it has to do with the show

1244
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:34,320
So that would be my thing. I'd want a fancy like I want a state-of-the-art computer recording studio

1245
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,320
That's what I want. Yeah

1246
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:40,160
Matt I want a ddrx machine

1247
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,640
Ooh

1248
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:45,200
That's pretty uh pricey nice and new

1249
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,520
and new

1250
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,520
darsagra

1251
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,840
Really? I can't say that there's too much that I would really want that I don't already have

1252
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,280
um, I actually want a uh

1253
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,920
a pc engine duo rx

1254
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:06,340
A pc engine duo rx and an arcade card so that I can play sapphire

1255
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,480
And I want a baby pac-man machine fuck yes

1256
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,040
Well, you know, you know what the hell are the studio just bring me a baby pac-man machine

1257
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:21,440
I already have the pinball machine that I really want. Uh-huh. I have my world cup soccer

1258
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,980
Can you believe that dan actually asked me if I would trade it temporarily?

1259
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,200
Okay, i'm gonna go I can't go on a completely like random tangent for a minute for it

1260
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,680
Okay, here's the thing it is related though. Um, I on twitter

1261
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:39,200
I follow some other podcasters some other indie podcasters and one of the podcasters I follow is one of the guys from video game outsiders

1262
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,960
And he posted a youtube today. I guess he picked up some new. Um

1263
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:49,360
Popeye machine or something. I guess what he does. He has like like how you amass a bunch of pinball machines in your house

1264
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,680
He amasses a bunch of 80s, uh stuff in his basement

1265
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,360
Not a bunch of babies

1266
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,880
Hey, I found this baby at the mall

1267
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:04,480
No, i'm gonna take it home and raise it to do my work. No, you stop trying to start a podcast war

1268
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,560
I could just see it now dude the guy

1269
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:11,760
I can see they're gonna read an email on the show the guys from olr said you have babies in your basement

1270
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,680
What do you have to say about that they're crunchy

1271
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,640
No, no, no, but he's got like all these old school 80s machines I was like, oh cool cool and like, um,

1272
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:26,160
you know, I was I was looking at the pop I wanted but I went to his youtube channel because I was like

1273
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:29,840
I wonder if he shows off other stuff like this and he does and one of the youtubes that he had

1274
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,040
Was him getting his new baby pac-man machine

1275
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:40,320
And I have to admit it's the first time i've ever really watched something like that another podcaster did where I was completely

1276
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:45,600
Overcome with jealousy like just total jealousy. I was looking at it going

1277
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:51,120
That is so cool. I am so fucking jealous. I want I want one of those fuckers so badly

1278
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,520
Even the baby pac-man sort of sucks ass

1279
01:33:54,480 --> 01:34:02,420
It does novelty. It's it's the novelty of the only successful incarnation of video and pinball has been pinball 2000

1280
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,960
Really?

1281
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,960
So there you go

1282
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,720
God now they're gonna get I can just see it now who said you keep babies in your basement

1283
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,860
No, it's baby pac-man that he had in his basement that I was completely

1284
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,120
And utterly overcome with jealousy. Yeah babies

1285
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:21,040
I mean if I could find one of those machines cheap, you know, I would put that shit in this garage

1286
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:26,640
You wouldn't find one cheap. Good luck unless it's completely destroyed and gutted. I know last email dan

1287
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:31,600
Come fix my baby pac-man because I don't know dick about pinball games

1288
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,440
Last email. Okay. Hey, olr. It's from cheeseburger, by the way

1289
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,200
Well me being the huge star crash fan as I am

1290
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,920
I never started playing world of warcraft because I would become addicted

1291
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,600
Well yesterday I went to my friend's house and he started a free trial of wow

1292
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,700
He had 256 megabytes of ram out of the two gigabytes recommended

1293
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:58,480
So I started a trial on my laptop because it has one gigabyte of ram so he could play

1294
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,040
Without much lag while I was there

1295
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:06,800
Well, I got home and started playing for a few hours. So my question is for sky what server or whatever it is

1296
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:12,400
You it's called do you play on I play on the garithos. Did I spell that right?

1297
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:18,160
Right server i'm level nine and I wanted to know if it's worth buying and if I can switch server to play on with you

1298
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,240
Also, tell me a little about the game and some of the things that will convince me to buy it

1299
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:24,960
I'm going to give you an answer

1300
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:30,800
You weren't expecting because if I remember right cheeseburgers like 15 years old 14 15 like he's a younger listener of ours

1301
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,200
My advice to you is not to buy world of warcraft

1302
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:38,960
Because you're still in school and if you get sucked into a game like world of warcraft, um, it could affect your school

1303
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:42,880
Here's the thing if you know in your heart and in your gut in your mind

1304
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:46,400
You can restrict yourself to playing this game one or two hours a day tops

1305
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,760
Then it might be okay, but honestly, it's the social element

1306
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,520
That's what really these games are all about

1307
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,520
I mean I could describe all about like the quest and the classes and the magic and all this stuff

1308
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,000
But you know what? You're playing the game. You see all that firsthand

1309
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,760
The reason why people get addicted to this stuff is the social element. It's logging

1310
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:07,360
It's it's you know, when I log on to the game and I say hello to the guild everybody goes rob, you know

1311
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:12,240
It's like walking into cheers the bar and everybody yells norm. It's it's that kind of thing

1312
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,880
That's that's the reward that you're going to get out of a game like warcraft. Um that being said

1313
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,880
I play on the server raven crest and if you want more information, it's all in our forms

1314
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,320
That's a cheap plug for the forms

1315
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,280
And that way people who only really really want it will get it

1316
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,960
But yeah, it's kind of I know i'm like such an addict of the game. But you know

1317
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,600
Uh, i'm also not in school

1318
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,640
And uh, sometimes even I have to really limit myself on how much i'll play

1319
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,440
Yeah, that's actually sort of a reason why I have I really

1320
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,480
Am loath to get back into world of warcraft myself

1321
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:47,760
It's because I know how little time i'll have to play except like maybe on a weekend and then when you're still enjoying

1322
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,320
Ragnarok the thing that sucks too is that if you get far behind the rest of your guild you start to feel like

1323
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,560
You're just out of it. You know what I mean?

1324
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:57,840
So that's you know, the competition's a lot. So

1325
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,880
There you go. That's that's my honest advice

1326
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,240
Ta-da, so that was it for emails

1327
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:10,560
I said that didn't I? All right. Sorry. Well, I wasn't listening surprised gee rob. All right. I don't listen to this show

1328
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,560
I just talk on it

1329
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:16,740
All right. That's it for emails. If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange launch radio.com

1330
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,240
We'll get some more stuff from you later during the skype line

1331
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,400
Even though I don't know how long we can go tonight because it's fucking freezing out here in the garage

1332
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:29,040
But we will get some more stories first. It's not as cold as it was last week. It's still pretty fucking cold

1333
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:36,000
It's still pretty fucking cold. I love this quilt. Oh, it's so cold. All right, uh logi, um, there's rumors that

1334
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,000
the uh

1335
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,720
PSP is getting another revision. Uh, the PSP 4000 is apparently due out late 09

1336
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:48,480
This is coming to us from Eurogamer that reports their publishing sources

1337
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:53,360
Indicate that uh Sony is planning on doing this and eventually will launch a PSP 2

1338
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:59,360
I mean, I think it's a no-brainer that they're eventually going to launch some sort of portable gaming system later on, you know

1339
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,840
Update the hardware that kind of makes sense

1340
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:06,000
um, and it wouldn't you know be a surprise if they

1341
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,880
Fix some more stuff on the PSP again

1342
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,440
But of course Sony is saying they have no plans for a PSP 2

1343
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,600
Where have I heard we have no plans for something before?

1344
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:24,720
Oh, I know on every other rumor that they have no plans on like no plans for a pice cut no plans on releasing a 160

1345
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:30,640
Gigabyte system no plans for doing something that it's completely obvious no plans to release a good system

1346
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,120
We have no plans on ever becoming the number one console

1347
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,840
again

1348
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,840
So when you hear no plans

1349
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,160
Hear them saying it's like we are, you know, so

1350
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,800
yeah, just

1351
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,640
Big deal. We know hardware revisions coming. Not a big surprise

1352
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:54,880
A sequel to a popular handheld system might happen you think?

1353
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,760
Hello. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought

1354
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,080
Hey, uh moving on over to Nintendo who has been number one lately

1355
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:06,080
Although amongst the hardcore gamers, uh, some of us are starting to feel a little jaded

1356
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:11,840
I don't know. This is something that some hardcore gamers will be into but probably more for the casual crowd and the young folks

1357
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:19,380
Um, some of the early 2009 releases for Nintendo, of course headlined by Pokemon Platinum on March 22nd

1358
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,480
That is going to be a pretty big title on the Nintendo DS even though isn't it just the last two Pokemon?

1359
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,640
It's it's just like they do this all the time

1360
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:31,520
They release, you know, like, you know red and blue and then there's yellow that has something special, you know

1361
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,800
It's it's it's just I think there's supposed to be new pokemons in this one

1362
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:41,440
All right, then again and it also has some weird like uh level structures and stuff. It's like kind of neat looking interesting

1363
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:48,480
Um some other games that are coming out, uh Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echo of Time is supposed to actually come out this spring

1364
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:54,080
So we'll see what happens with that. Um, let's see. What else is supposed to come out here? I've got like a whole list

1365
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,720
um

1366
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:02,720
That is spring that they said that game would come out March. Yeah, probably the later the better, um

1367
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,040
For them not drag quest five

1368
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,720
Is that on

1369
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:12,640
That's on DS. No, I don't see it listed in their list not in the first three months of the year

1370
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,720
Oh really be a little later. No, unless it hasn't been announced yet. I don't know

1371
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,480
I'm trying to look at some first part

1372
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:22,080
Let's see Sega's putting out the house of the dead overkill on Wii in February

1373
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,120
Sonic and the black knight in March and mad world in March

1374
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:30,560
Ubisoft's got Tenchu in February and broken sword shadows the Templars in March

1375
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:36,880
Nintendo, first party games, the only stuff they're putting out Mario power tennis in March and Pikmin in March

1376
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,960
That's it on the Wii. Yeah on the Wii

1377
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:44,480
However on the DS from Nintendo personal trainer math on January 12th

1378
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,880
Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon on February 16th and the before mentioned Pokemon Platinum

1379
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,040
Which is kind of in line with their one title a month

1380
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:56,640
Konami however is putting out the new Elibits game the adventures of Kai and Zero is coming out first quarter of uh,

1381
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:04,160
The new year the suikoden tactical game suikoden tear crease is coming out on in the first quarter as is little magicians magic

1382
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,160
adventure all those from Konami

1383
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:14,640
And then I'm trying to see Ubisoft has a bunch of games coming out imagine cheerleader imagine family doctor imagine ice champions

1384
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:19,600
And American pop star road to celebrity what an awesome year it's turning out to be

1385
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,640
For the Nintendo DS. Did you see what they named those?

1386
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:26,640
You remember the play on the Wii games new play control

1387
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,240
Yeah

1388
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:32,800
That's a retarded name. Just call it like I don't know cash cow Pikmin

1389
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,240
I do want to point out Konami is putting out a game on the Wii that some of you guys might care about ddr

1390
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,920
Disney grooves

1391
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,640
For those that are still playing ddr after all these years. There you go

1392
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:50,320
Ssh 100 matt in chat says factor 5 goes down, but sonic team is still around. Where's the justice?

1393
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,320
Where's the justice?

1394
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,480
That's that for first quarter lineup

1395
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:01,920
Well, how about something very cool for all of our?

1396
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:06,960
8-bit fans which by the way, thank you for the old school Nintendo entertainment system dar

1397
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:11,760
Sakura's kind of like a second Christmas gift slash late birthday gift. Well also thanks sauce for

1398
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:17,360
Thank you sauce to the trade for agreeing to a trade that I got the better end of the deal of

1399
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:26,000
Well, um, if anyone who is a big Nintendo fan, this is especially cool. Also, it's really cool for the fans of pac-man champion

1400
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,680
Edition, it's been remade for the Nintendo entertainment system

1401
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:36,960
It actually is fully functional actually just like the same. It looks pretty damn cool

1402
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,920
Looking at a video here on this site. Sorry. That's what you're hearing in the background

1403
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,920
I'm looking at a video here on this site. Sorry. That's what you're hearing in the background

1404
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,400
Interesting looking

1405
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:01,200
I don't know. It seems like it's a hacked ROM of some sort because the music in the background is strange

1406
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,000
Right, it doesn't sound like pac-man at all. Anyway, there you go. That's that's what it sounds like

1407
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:13,120
It might be trying to emulate the music from hmm, maybe well at any rate. Um, you um

1408
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:20,560
There's no idea where you can find the ROM. It's from the pac-mania soundtrack. Oh, is it? Oh

1409
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:25,600
Sorry, if that was loud guys, it wasn't loud to us in the studio, but I guess it came out very loud over the um,

1410
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:30,800
But hey whoever whoever finds it then let me know what you think of it. So cool

1411
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:36,080
Yeah, apparently the weird thing about this is that it's it's still unknown if this is like real or a concept thing

1412
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,800
Because no ROM has showed up out there

1413
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,680
Who knows

1414
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:46,660
That's the weird thing about it. Is it like it's not something you can actually like download for use in an emulator

1415
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,000
But they say it's an actual 8-bit nintendo game

1416
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,480
I don't know

1417
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:59,920
Um a game that is coming out on the ds, uh grand theft auto chinatown wars has been dated now for um march

1418
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:05,300
Which is weird because I thought it was dated before for january, but either way it's coming out now march 17th

1419
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,440
grand theft auto chinatown wars and uh will feature

1420
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,680
most of liberty city

1421
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:12,240
um

1422
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:17,840
I think they're cutting out all their need from um grand theft auto 4 but most of it and it's going to kind of look

1423
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,920
a little bit like um

1424
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,600
The old grand theft auto 1 and 2 games, you know kind of a top-down 3d

1425
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:26,640
Type of game and it's all cel-shaded

1426
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,280
but still violent and

1427
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,280
pretty cool looking

1428
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,600
Yay, cool looking things

1429
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,240
Europe will be getting the game three days later on march 20th

1430
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,680
Well, that's good that it's not getting delayed so bad. Yeah

1431
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,120
And I can't wait to try the online multiplayer. That'd be fun

1432
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,280
Of course tons of people be cheating in it because they can i'm sure

1433
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:53,920
Okay, so, um, here's something interesting going on I don't I don't know what the hell you want to call this

1434
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,800
But I don't know if you've heard about this project. It's called bob's game

1435
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,920
And it's this guy who's spent a lot a lot of time making a particular ds home brew project

1436
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,000
He's apparently going on protests

1437
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:11,440
He's going to be spending 100 days locked in his room locked and barricaded from the outside to protest how nintendo has been treating his project

1438
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:18,480
Here's the thing he needs a ds software development kit to get his game which is um

1439
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:22,800
I guess what bob made is some type of like 2d adventure thing. It looks really cool

1440
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,720
He actually wants to sell it as a retail game, but nintendo will not give him one

1441
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:32,320
Even though bob has apparently talked to nintendo done the application told he was going to get an answer in a few months

1442
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:36,960
And apparently 17 weeks have come by no answer. No kid has showed up

1443
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:42,800
However, now what he's going to be planning is his 100 day sit down protest. So he's doing a tantrum

1444
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:45,920
Basically, he's throwing a fit fucking grow up

1445
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:50,640
Well, he's been giving the run around with you know stuff and his game does look really cool

1446
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,560
Um, that's kind of too bad, you know

1447
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:58,640
Unfortunately, i'd be hitting up other publishers or whatever and see if they can publish your game or there's more. I gotta read all this

1448
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:03,200
Um, apparently he met with nintendo in february about a year ago to ask for the kit

1449
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:07,520
He teleconferenced he flew to game developers conference and had a face-to-face meeting

1450
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,040
Uh, he talked to the wario world division who sent him to marketing

1451
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:14,160
He talked to marketing and they sent him back to the wario world division

1452
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:19,040
Uh on the application it said it would be six to eight weeks for a decision. It's been 17

1453
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,040
He says he's met all the requirements

1454
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:28,080
He's a financially stable registered company with an fein which I believe is a federal identification number. I'm working from a commercial address

1455
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:33,440
Um, and he says that when nintendo decides to approve the developer license, he will end his protest

1456
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:37,440
Apparently you can actually watch on live webcam. I'm actually going to go to the site right now

1457
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,680
It looks like he's asleep, but you can see something on the board right now says reggie on the monitor there and uh,

1458
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,360
it is

1459
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:50,640
Yep, it's actually his live confinement right now, but it looks like he's fast asleep or something or he left the room

1460
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,960
But he's on day 12

1461
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:58,000
He's not supposed to leave the room. He's not it says he sleeps behind the camera. Oh

1462
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,200
Where's his potty i'm assuming I hope that's all behind the camera too or something

1463
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:08,000
But anyway, um, he says he cannot leave the room the door is locked and barricaded from the outside

1464
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:13,040
He's sleeping behind the camera. Yes. There is a shower food is being delivered once a week by a friend

1465
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:17,440
There is no internet access television or game consoles besides the ones he's developing on

1466
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:22,880
He can receive and send email on his cell phone so he can get nintendo's reply and update the site

1467
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:28,240
And the led counter will be incremented once a day. Sometimes it will display hints and secret messages

1468
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,040
So, yes jamie he's throwing a tantrum

1469
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:41,040
Is doing the equivalent of sticking his fingers in the in his ears and closing his eyes going lala

1470
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:49,760
Well still though what about the point that he's meeting all of nintendo's requirements and nintendo's dicking him

1471
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:54,720
What what about that to play devil's advocate? We need more imagine games

1472
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:00,720
We don't have time with this good adventure crap need more imagine and more pets if it's got imagine and pets in it

1473
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:06,120
we can definitely do something with it. Oh, and if it's a sim. More sim games.

1474
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:10,200
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, you need to get an interview with this guy. I don't know if I can. He has

1475
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:14,900
no phone, right? I can't, oh no, he has a cell phone. Maybe I can. I guess I could try

1476
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:21,880
sending an email. I don't know. Misty in chat says, there's better ways to bitch about it.

1477
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:30,200
Like not eating. Fasting. Like sending duty to Reggie. Hunger strike? Yes, a hunger strike.

1478
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:33,840
That's what I was looking for. I am not on a hunger strike. I was shoving my mouth full

1479
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:45,800
of food. I'm on a food strike where I do nothing but eat food. That's my response. All right.

1480
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:52,560
Redertainment says, imagine Bob's pet sims adventure. Amazing. All right, so good luck

1481
01:48:52,560 --> 01:49:02,320
Bob on your protest, I guess. Um, don't die. Geez. Just kind of fucking ridiculous. And

1482
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:12,200
by kinda, I mean really. Well, this is very, very happy, happy news for me. Because I have

1483
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:18,200
been wanting this game, and I played the other two, and it's freaking beautiful. But Klonoa

1484
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:24,400
Door to Phantom Isle is going to be coming out in North America. And that makes me giddy.

1485
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:32,480
And it's supposed to be out in Spring 2009. And it's supposed to be keeping the original

1486
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:37,040
design because everybody said they wanted it. And the North American version will have

1487
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:43,480
some gesture controls. Basic control though is be triggered to grab your enemies and flick

1488
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:50,360
the Wiimote to throw. Which is kinda cool. Um, it has an NES style Wiimote using the

1489
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:57,160
GameCube controller. And the classic controller is also, uh, you can use that too. And, uh,

1490
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:06,080
there is a rumor that the Klonoa 2 remake is on its way. Klonoa 2 is freaking hard.

1491
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:11,360
But I really, really, really, really, really love Klonoa.

1492
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:15,160
Maybe this took so long to come out in the US because the Klonoa developers locked themselves

1493
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:21,840
in a room for 100 days until Nintendo agreed to put out their game.

1494
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,840
Just sayin'.

1495
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:33,280
Hmm. Well, um, you know, after much begging and pleading, apparently EA has decided to

1496
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:41,200
graciously allow players to be able to reinstall their copies of Spore after uninstalling it.

1497
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:46,560
They can now download a tool from EA that will let you deauthorize your PC and effectively

1498
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:53,080
allow you to override the game's install-on-five-PCs limit, as you can manage the availability

1499
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:55,160
of all five machine slots.

1500
01:50:55,160 --> 01:51:05,280
Hooray. But unfortunately there's not a tool that's gotten me back interested in Spore

1501
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:11,600
again, to which actually my cat knocked a disk on the floor in its case, and I was like,

1502
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:12,600
eh, it's a good place for it.

1503
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:19,920
Nice. So do you let the cat rearrange all your furniture?

1504
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:24,720
She does that on her own. She decides that she wants to cram herself in the tiny space

1505
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:31,400
that is between my monitor on the shelf and the top of my desk. It's, like, less than,

1506
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:35,880
you know, about six inches tall, but somehow she decides that she wants to cram herself

1507
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:36,880
in there.

1508
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,640
But cats are cute, so she gets away with it, right?

1509
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:41,080
Yeah, unfortunately she does.

1510
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:42,080
What's your cat's name again?

1511
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,080
Stella.

1512
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:50,160
Stella. That's right. Uh, hey, um, the RIAA. Apparently some kitties, some cute kittens

1513
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:55,360
went into the RIAA office and just, they made them go, aw, and shucks, because they decided

1514
01:51:55,360 --> 01:52:00,080
to do something nice this holiday season. They are no longer going to sue individual

1515
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,840
file sharers or harass universities anymore.

1516
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,960
Woo! That's our deadly war music!

1517
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:10,000
Hold up, hold up. Instead, what the RIAA plans to do is that they are going to report people

1518
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,760
that they suspect of copyright infringement directly to the ISPs. The ISPs will then investigate

1519
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:18,380
the customers and either issue a warning or implement restrictions, whatever they decide

1520
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:24,160
is needed. Apparently what the benefit will be to the ISPs, the participation is voluntary,

1521
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:27,880
but they'll be able to better control the congestion on their networks by applying this

1522
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:30,080
new little policy.

1523
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:35,200
Some words from Ars Technica on the original report of this. Suddenly, ISPs gained a tremendous

1524
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:39,280
new tool. One study in the UK showed that most people sharing music would stop when

1525
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:43,360
made aware that their activity was being tracked and that they were not, in fact, anonymous.

1526
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:47,960
Should that hold true in the US, ISPs would presumably see massive decreases in P2P traffic.

1527
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:51,340
The customer notifications can be blasted out by email, making the whole process quick

1528
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:55,480
and easy for ISPs. As is usual for these sorts of schemes, questions still remain about what

1529
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:59,980
sorts of judicial processes will be in place to contest notifications and penalties, and

1530
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:03,720
what happens to a household internet connection when Dad finds his access cancelled, even

1531
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:05,760
though he's never shared a file in his life.

1532
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:12,760
Yeah, whatever. It's not going to work very well, but hey, you know, whatever.

1533
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,840
So pirate away, everybody!

1534
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:15,760
Pretty much.

1535
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,320
Just kidding. You shouldn't pirate, because that's why all these people got laid off this

1536
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,960
week, so yeah. It was all your fault.

1537
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,960
Yeah, it's the RIAA's coming after you for music. So, stop downloading...

1538
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:29,440
I wonder if there's any companies that are going to say, nope, we're not participating.

1539
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,320
Go fuck yourself.

1540
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:33,920
Yes, stop downloading music and start downloading movies.

1541
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,560
J-Rod in chat says, I got a letter from my ISP about downloading HBO shows. It didn't

1542
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:39,560
stop my torrenting.

1543
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:45,560
Well, I've never received any kind of cease and desist, so...

1544
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:51,560
The only letters I received from my ISP is, we're raising your rates. It's like, thanks.

1545
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:58,560
You know, and if you're downloading TV shows, I mean, they were on TV... I don't get it.

1546
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:05,560
Well, some other very interesting news. Let's move away a little bit from the RIAA bastards.

1547
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:14,720
EA and Steam have decided to make sweet love.

1548
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:21,720
So there's going to be EA games that are available through Steam's service, which is Mass Effect,

1549
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:28,760
Need for Speed Undercover, and Spore, and the Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack, FIFA

1550
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:35,760
Manager 09, and Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning. So that's going to be hanging out there.

1551
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:38,560
So they're getting steamy?

1552
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:44,240
They're getting steamy. Also, others slated for there is Mirror's Edge Command and Conquer,

1553
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:48,680
Ad Alert 3, and Dead Space.

1554
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:53,680
But not mix steamy, or else the RIAA might sue them for sharing ABC shows.

1555
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:54,720
What?

1556
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:58,280
Nothing, never mind.

1557
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:00,560
If you didn't get that joke, good for you.

1558
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,440
Who in this room doesn't watch TV? Oh, that's me.

1559
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:08,800
Even you watch some TV. You just don't watch TV, like, on TV.

1560
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:11,120
I watch DVDs after the fact.

1561
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:11,520
There you go.

1562
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:17,120
I will going to be watching a show as soon as it's got new episodes on, when it airs.

1563
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:19,400
See, American Idol.

1564
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,520
Supernatural.

1565
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,040
What if there's David Cook 2 on American Idol next year?

1566
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:24,520
No.

1567
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:27,600
Will you watch that?

1568
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:32,520
And keep in mind, I watched American Idol through YouTube.

1569
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:38,160
Well this year they're actually getting rid of, or they're limiting the amount of the

1570
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:40,880
bad singers that they have on the show.

1571
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:47,280
After that I say, great, another show I don't have to watch anymore.

1572
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:52,360
So apparently, you know, Crackdown 2 is a game that I wish would come out, because Crackdown

1573
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:56,200
1 was awesome, and it does need a sequel.

1574
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:59,880
But of course, you know, Real Time Worlds, they're busy working on the game that I'm

1575
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:04,760
going to have to get back into MMOs for, and that would be APB.

1576
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:08,640
But until that happens, people still wish for Crackdown 2.

1577
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:13,040
Well, there was a rumor that Crackdown 2 was actually being developed by another company,

1578
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:19,600
Ruffian Games, however, that may not be the case anymore.

1579
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:25,360
The studio head, Colin McDonald, actually said, you know, they would like to make the

1580
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:32,000
sequel for Crackdown, although to date they have not been offered for Microsoft for Crackdown

1581
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
sequel.

1582
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,840
They are having ongoing discussions with them, and they would feel really hurt if Microsoft

1583
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:43,840
went to some other studio to develop it.

1584
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,400
Wasn't there rumors that that's exactly what Microsoft did?

1585
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:50,920
Yeah, there was, but they don't know.

1586
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:57,040
They said that they would doubt that Microsoft would choose a startup, I guess it says a

1587
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:04,240
startup on RTW's doorstep, Ruffian, I don't know why they would choose them, I guess.

1588
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:07,440
Jay Roddon in chat says, Crackdown, oh, you meant that bonus disc that came with the Halo

1589
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,600
3 beta?

1590
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:12,160
Yes, that's the one.

1591
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:15,760
The game is awesome, okay, seriously.

1592
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,760
Way better than the Halo 3 beta.

1593
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,960
It wasn't bad, it wasn't bad.

1594
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:23,120
I probably played, actually, in reality, I probably did play more Crackdown than I did

1595
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:24,640
Halo 3, and I didn't even know the game.

1596
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:25,640
Crackdown was awesome.

1597
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:27,440
It was crack.

1598
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:28,440
Down.

1599
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,440
Down.

1600
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:32,440
One more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to get into some last minute stories

1601
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:38,200
in the Skype line, and this is filed under kind of a little bit of WTF.

1602
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:43,080
Xbox Live, you know, XNA has really opened it up in the whole community games thing for

1603
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:47,440
people to make literally anything, and that is exactly what's happened, is literally anything

1604
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,300
has popped up now in the store.

1605
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:56,720
It's a game, quote, fireplace, and what it does, it makes all the sights and the sounds

1606
01:57:56,720 --> 01:58:02,000
of a winter fireplace via your Xbox 360 on the television.

1607
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,280
It's like one of those, like, you remember the old cassette tapes that was just nothing

1608
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:09,080
but the fire that you could play in the background during Christmas?

1609
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:10,080
That's basically what this is.

1610
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:11,080
Don't you mean a videotape?

1611
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:12,080
Huh?

1612
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,080
Don't you mean a videotape?

1613
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:14,080
Yeah.

1614
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:17,140
But what did they call it, like a virtual yule log or something like that?

1615
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:18,140
Virtual fireplace.

1616
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:19,320
I don't know what they call it.

1617
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:24,440
They still have those, and they actually have Blu-rays now of virtual fireplaces.

1618
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:25,640
People buy this shit.

1619
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,400
That's the amazing thing.

1620
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:33,880
We should make the official OLR yule log and just make tons and tons of money off people's

1621
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:34,880
impulse buys.

1622
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:35,880
I don't know.

1623
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:36,880
Kind of crazy.

1624
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:42,520
Apparently, you can get the demo on your Xbox 360, and you can even get that on the internet.

1625
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:45,260
Just download it right away, and you can get like a little four-minute demo, but here's

1626
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:46,260
the thing.

1627
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:51,000
If you want the full version, it's 400 points.

1628
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:57,520
Now I'm not going to give this guy a lot of shit because having talked to Aaron on a previous

1629
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:03,520
show who made Snake 360 and talking to the community developers, I think there's a certain

1630
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:08,720
range of points that they can charge, and so probably 400 is like all this guy can't

1631
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:09,720
charge.

1632
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:10,720
I don't know.

1633
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,720
I don't know if he can charge less.

1634
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:12,720
No.

1635
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:13,720
No?

1636
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:14,720
200.

1637
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:15,720
I have some for 200.

1638
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,720
Let's see.

1639
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:17,720
Hold on.

1640
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,720
I want to look at some video of this thing in action here.

1641
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:19,720
Let's see.

1642
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:22,320
I'm going to actually play a little video.

1643
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,160
Yep.

1644
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:28,000
That is definitely a virtual log.

1645
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:34,480
To be honest, you could probably purchase a DVD for cheaper than five bucks.

1646
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:37,680
Yeah, you could probably go to the 99 Cents store and get one of these DVDs.

1647
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:42,280
The 99 Cents store has some pretty funny movies there.

1648
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:46,720
In fact, that'd be really fun to make stocking stuffers with the 99 Cents clearance center

1649
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:47,720
movies.

1650
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,720
Awesome.

1651
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,160
There's some absolute crap.

1652
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:51,160
It's awesome.

1653
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:52,160
That's...

1654
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,520
God, you don't even press a button.

1655
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:58,640
It would be awesome if you pressed a button and you could throw a kitten in the fire and

1656
01:59:58,640 --> 01:59:59,640
watch what happens.

1657
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:00,640
A kitten?

1658
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:01,640
I'm just kidding.

1659
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:02,640
That's wrong.

1660
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:03,640
No, I'm kidding.

1661
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:04,640
It is wrong, but funny.

1662
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:05,640
A reindeer.

1663
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:06,640
That's more festive.

1664
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:07,640
Or Santa.

1665
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:08,720
You just watch Santa dropping the chimney into the fire.

1666
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:12,060
See, that would be worth 400 points.

1667
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:14,440
Or Christmas lemmings.

1668
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:17,720
As Dark Tetsuya in Chat says, or a ferret.

1669
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:19,840
There you go.

1670
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:24,240
Tiger Claw says, there's even an app on the iPhone and iPod touch of a virtual fireplace

1671
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:26,360
for only 99 cents.

1672
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:28,320
I got a Zippo lighter one for free.

1673
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:35,960
All right, we're going to go to some last minute stories from Loki and then we'll take

1674
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,880
some calls on our Skype line.

1675
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:41,880
Well, there's been some new patches for some PC games.

1676
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:44,280
Darkrai 2 got a patch to fix their widescreen issues.

1677
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:47,960
Apparently it had the same thing that was wrong with Bioshock with it.

1678
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:51,360
They were kind of letterboxing it in the reverse, I guess.

1679
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,640
But now that's fixed, so yay.

1680
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:58,560
And well, other things.

1681
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:03,520
Sony is claiming that they're going to get rid of their clamshell packaging.

1682
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:14,480
They are working to, I guess, go greener and they actually promoted their little announcement

1683
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:20,240
with a crappy video that's called Sony declares death to the clamshell.

1684
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:21,680
And it was awful.

1685
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:25,840
And I highly recommend that you don't watch it.

1686
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:31,160
And other than that, not a whole lot else going on, man.

1687
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:34,560
It's like, talk about slow going.

1688
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:39,320
Well, it is Christmas week for heaven's sake, but hey, or well, you know, coming up, but

1689
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:43,760
I am so excited about the clamshell news because I think those, that packaging is horrible

1690
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:44,760
evil stuff.

1691
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:48,160
I, oh, oh, grrr.

1692
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:49,320
Clamshell packaging can go die in a fire.

1693
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:53,120
I'm really excited to hear that's, I want to press a button and watch all my old clamshell

1694
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:54,400
packaging get burned in the fire.

1695
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,200
Cause that annoys me.

1696
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:01,520
All right, we're taking your calls 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on orange or her username on Skype

1697
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,880
is orange lounge radio.

1698
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,080
I've been doing this a little bit too long.

1699
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:09,880
Can you believe next week is our last show of 2008 and then we will go into the year

1700
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:13,080
2009, which would be our seventh year of podcasting.

1701
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:17,080
If you could believe it or seventh year of doing this show, I guess podcasting has been

1702
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:19,520
around seven years, but you know what I mean?

1703
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,680
Crazy stuff.

1704
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:22,480
We're getting old.

1705
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:24,120
We're getting old next year.

1706
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:26,920
One of us will kill another live on air.

1707
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:27,920
Just wait for it.

1708
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:29,880
Stay tuned.

1709
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:34,800
Would you spend $5 for a yule log game on the 360 where you could throw clamshell packages

1710
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,000
into the fire?

1711
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,200
I might.

1712
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:39,400
I just might be willing to spend that kind of money.

1713
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:42,800
Except you wouldn't because you'd have to use the D pad to do that.

1714
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:43,800
And yeah.

1715
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:44,800
All right.

1716
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,440
I'm going to the chat or I'm sorry, the phone.

1717
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:50,120
That's getting late and I haven't even cracked open the eggnog yet.

1718
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:51,240
Hi, you're on orange lounge radio.

1719
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:52,240
Who's this?

1720
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:54,240
Legend of Zaku.

1721
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:55,520
Hey, Legend of Zaku.

1722
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,520
What's up?

1723
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:57,520
Nothing much.

1724
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:59,360
You know, today's my birthday, right?

1725
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:03,800
Or for the next less than 40 minutes.

1726
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:07,880
Well happy Hanukkah and birthday.

1727
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:09,380
Not Jewish.

1728
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:10,380
That's all right.

1729
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:13,720
You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate Hanukkah.

1730
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:14,720
I get gelt.

1731
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:18,280
I love those potato latkes though.

1732
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:19,280
Hell yeah.

1733
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:20,840
One of my friends was supposed to make me some of those.

1734
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:22,480
That sounds delish.

1735
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:27,040
Sorry, the house is turning into Silent Hill here.

1736
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:31,560
The door just blew open into the house and it's kind of creepy because of all the wind

1737
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:34,880
blowing outside and the storms.

1738
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:38,880
Maybe in our seventh year of podcasting, Pyramid Head will rape us all live on air.

1739
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,880
Yikes.

1740
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:40,880
Nice.

1741
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:41,880
All right.

1742
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:42,880
What's on your mind, Zaku?

1743
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:44,360
Nothing much.

1744
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:48,480
Just trying to scurry up as much money as possible to get me something, at least one

1745
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:56,640
game for Christmas since the last game I bought was GTA 4 back in May, like April or May.

1746
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:57,640
It's been a while.

1747
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:02,680
I mean, I'm unemployed right now, I'm trying to find work and I can't be pissing my money

1748
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:07,620
away on unnecessary things like that when the bills have to be paid first and foremost.

1749
02:04:07,620 --> 02:04:11,320
I heard that Prince of Persia dropped in price the 40 bucks.

1750
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,320
Where at?

1751
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:13,320
Everywhere.

1752
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:14,320
PC?

1753
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:15,320
What, for PC?

1754
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:18,320
No, for PS3 and Xbox 360.

1755
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:22,680
See, I'm trying to give my PC some love.

1756
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:26,600
I was going to ask, what one game are you thinking of buying because you must have something

1757
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,600
in mind.

1758
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:28,600
Left 4 Dead.

1759
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:29,600
Left 4 Dead.

1760
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:30,600
Ah, Left 4 Dead.

1761
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:31,600
Why Left 4 Dead?

1762
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:40,560
Well, because that's just like playing Half-Life with zombies but with at least subpar storyline

1763
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:45,120
with it and I get to use my keyboard and mouse.

1764
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:46,760
Nice.

1765
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:47,760
Very cool, very cool.

1766
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:49,840
I've heard a lot of good things about Left 4 Dead but I think that's another one of those

1767
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:53,680
games that I won't probably actually get to check out until next year just because I'm

1768
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:56,200
playing so much other crap like, wow.

1769
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:57,200
Yeah.

1770
02:04:57,200 --> 02:05:00,880
Well, I'm sorry to hear about the financial tough times but, you know, it's something

1771
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:01,880
a lot of people are going through.

1772
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:02,880
I mean, I have plenty of money saved up.

1773
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,480
I'm not worried about, you know, the bills but, you know, I can't burn that money that

1774
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:07,480
quickly.

1775
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:09,400
That money has to last me until I find work.

1776
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:10,400
Right.

1777
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,400
No, that's understandable.

1778
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:12,400
Mm-hmm.

1779
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:13,400
So, well.

1780
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:15,360
Yeah, I mean, I mean, other companies are struggling.

1781
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:19,840
I mean, you already had like two or, like about two or three companies going under in

1782
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:20,840
one week.

1783
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:21,840
Six.

1784
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,800
Six, well, not necessarily going under but doing layoffs.

1785
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:27,120
Six companies doing some type of closure or cutbacks this week.

1786
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:32,280
I know, I know Factor 5 and I think Free Radical went belly up.

1787
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:34,280
Yeah, we reported on it.

1788
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:36,400
I don't know if you were here at the very beginning of the show but we kicked off the

1789
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,400
show.

1790
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:41,760
Factor 5, EA, Midway, Free Radical, Asper and Turbine all did some type of closure or

1791
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,800
layoff this week.

1792
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:46,240
Looks like someone's not having a Christmas party this year.

1793
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:48,160
No, and it sucks.

1794
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,320
It's really too bad.

1795
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:50,320
It's really too bad.

1796
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:53,520
Well, you used to work in like cell phone games and stuff.

1797
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:54,520
Yes, I do.

1798
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:55,520
Are you surprised?

1799
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:58,760
And then this time last year I had a really nice Christmas party complete with like all

1800
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:04,080
you can eat stuff, open bar, you know, Guitar Hero, SingStar right there on a big, you know,

1801
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:05,920
on a nice big projection.

1802
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:09,040
Are you surprised by what's happened?

1803
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:11,000
I mean, it's shitty all around.

1804
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:17,040
It's like, you know, ask anybody, I bet you know at least 3 or 4 or 5 people that you

1805
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:20,440
know personally that are probably unemployed right now and are struggling to find work

1806
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:22,760
in this economy.

1807
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:26,880
I mean, I have so many skills right now.

1808
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:32,480
My experience is that I'm trying my best to secure work but it's a clusterfuck because

1809
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:34,920
I'm not the only one fighting for that same job.

1810
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:39,700
It's like hundreds upon thousands of other people fighting for that same position, especially

1811
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:41,280
here in New York.

1812
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,560
It is very, very tough out there right now.

1813
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:45,560
It's very tough.

1814
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:50,600
You're lucky you still have work whereas, you know, I had to work as a contractor, you

1815
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:56,160
know, since early this year since I got laid off from my full-time job.

1816
02:06:56,160 --> 02:07:01,120
And so, you know, I was connected and I had resources but they ran out over the summer.

1817
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:03,740
Oh no, I'm thankful to have a job.

1818
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:07,340
You know, I stopped bitching about the promotion I was supposed to get because a while ago

1819
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:11,920
they were trying to give me a promotion to work and I stopped bitching about it for now

1820
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:15,080
because I realized that, you know, I should just be lucky to have a job right now so I'm

1821
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:16,080
just going to shut up.

1822
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:17,080
Yeah.

1823
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:21,000
It's better to have a job, you know, better to be working than not be working at all like

1824
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
me right now.

1825
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Yeah.

1826
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,440
So, well, Zaku, best of luck in your search, maybe for your birthday, somebody will give

1827
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:28,440
you a new job.

1828
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:32,060
Well, hopefully if you want, you know, I could give you my resume, see what you could do

1829
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:33,060
with it.

1830
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:36,840
But then again, I live out, you know, here in New York so it wouldn't make any sense

1831
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,700
if I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm

1832
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:40,700
sending it all.

1833
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:41,700
Okay.

1834
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:44,000
Which unfortunately, I don't think I have the money to do right now.

1835
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,720
What the crap happened there?

1836
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,220
We got like bad echo and Skype.

1837
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,280
That was awesome.

1838
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,800
I think closed on me.

1839
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:53,420
That was weird.

1840
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:54,480
Okay.

1841
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:55,480
Wow.

1842
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:57,020
I swear we didn't do any thing.

1843
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:59,560
What the crap was that?

1844
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:01,540
Skype just crashed on us in studio.

1845
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:04,500
We got the error message and that happened.

1846
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:05,500
What the?

1847
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:06,500
robot

1848
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:10,380
okay first no dude this is like the beginning of a scary movie right here

1849
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:12,800
first we had the door blew open

1850
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:16,680
then we have uh... something happened with zaku on the skype line there

1851
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:19,120
what the shit

1852
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:21,560
i'm scared to take another call let's see what happened

1853
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:24,520
i don't think it was anything you did zaku sorry about that that's

1854
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:27,400
but i didn't do anything either that's a weird thing

1855
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:31,760
this is crazy

1856
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:35,660
let's take one more call hi uh...

1857
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:38,740

1858
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:40,180
goodnight jamie

1859
02:08:40,180 --> 02:08:42,580
dark knight is going to sleep

1860
02:08:42,580 --> 02:08:46,380
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

1861
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:49,340
this is dark knight y'all must had a one miss call moment

1862
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:51,700
hi dark knight what's on your mind buddy

1863
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:55,280
y'all must had a one miss call moment or something when that happened

1864
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:58,060
uh... it was it's very weird i don't know what the hell's going on with

1865
02:08:58,060 --> 02:09:01,600
skype we'll see maybe i need to upgrade but i thought i just upgraded last week

1866
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:03,620
but whatever what's on your mind buddy

1867
02:09:03,620 --> 02:09:07,500
uh... talking about the layoffs and what not free radical i got

1868
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:09,180
free radical i can understand

1869
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:14,100
them shutting their doors and what not cause like i said they had one bus game and whatnot

1870
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:19,640
it didn't really do much for really make much money for them at all

1871
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:20,760
and what not

1872
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:25,220
well yeah i mean you know it's still unfortunate they won't get a chance to

1873
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:28,320
do a second one you know what i mean that's true

1874
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:32,220
and they said they were working on the time splitter game right

1875
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:33,220
yeah so

1876
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:39,760
i mean i can understand that as far as mid weighting them doing layoffs and what not

1877
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:43,800
that one kind of hard to swallow because i mean

1878
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:49,260
the latest mortal kombat and what not they've been making their money off of that

1879
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:52,080
i did see the mortal kombat team was left intact

1880
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:55,920
mortal kombat team was left intact ok yeah mid weights kind of had a rough year outside of mortal combat

1881
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:59,080
Mortal Kombat you know we don't really know how the other games is selling yet

1882
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:02,280
but some of their other high-profile titles did not follow through the way

1883
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:05,360
they should and to be honest I can't think of a lot of Midway games I've

1884
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:09,840
gotten really excited about this year which is kind of a bummer but you know

1885
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:13,240
yeah I thought I would hear people talk about Blitz but I don't even think I

1886
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:15,960
heard people was talking about Blitz and everything like that

1887
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:19,640
no no but then EA I mean EA is kind of you know their year hasn't been that

1888
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:23,840
terrible yet they did a lot of layoffs too so it's kind of that's and that is a

1889
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:28,440
big shocker to hear that EA I figured I made comment earlier saying that if one

1890
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:32,520
of the big comp big game manufacturing companies did have any issues had layoffs

1891
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:36,840
did we really be scratching our heads if anything else it would be interesting to

1892
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:43,280
see if Nintendo say or not say a Nintendo Sony or Microsoft gets any

1893
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:46,880
brunt of this but I wouldn't think so because Nintendo they don't have a lot

1894
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:50,400
of workforce here you know compared to what they have over in Japan same with

1895
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:54,200
Sony and then Microsoft you know I i you know they're doing pretty well for

1896
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:57,720
themselves and Microsoft and so you know especially companies like Microsoft and

1897
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:01,180
Sony really have much more than just well then again last week we talked

1898
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:05,440
about layoffs to Sony didn't we so I guess maybe the Big 3 aren't infallible

1899
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:06,480
Governments

1900
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,680
entertainment oh thank you

1901
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:13,220
it's from general the general company I don't think it was for entertainment

1902
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:16,280
division but at least Microsoft Sony you know they have all those other divisions

1903
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:18,840
their company they're huge huge companies not just about the games still

1904
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:25,120
right still still and I mean it just and then you think about it then Sega is

1905
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:28,960
like Sega having their bad luck streak with their games and whatnot all the

1906
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:33,720
Sonic games and whatnot then find out problems with problems with their

1907
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:39,920
online gaming division and stuff like that I'm like here we go

1908
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:47,280
If Sega were to go then I'd be a lost sheep

1909
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:52,880
you know I would cry with you it's just it's not just that but just that all

1910
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:56,120
these companies are getting swallowed up by other companies too you know what I mean

1911
02:11:56,120 --> 02:12:03,320
yeah like um Koei and um Tecmo tried to go over combinations that coming up

1912
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:10,760
when companies that join forces and whatnot try to save money yikes yikes scary scary

1913
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:13,640
times well Dark Knight anything else on your mind before we let you go tonight

1928
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,920
of the year member this is really controversial last year because I ended

1929
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:38,820
up breaking the tie of the whole damn thing and I picked Super Metroid over

1930
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:43,040
Chrono Trigger and I got so much shit I'm still having to fucking live down

1931

from it well here's your chance to make right what you feel was wrong last year

1932
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:53,400
cuz they're doing it all over again they're soliciting right now your top 25 lists and

1933
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:57,460
they want us to submit our top 25 games of all time list to them to so I think I

1934
02:13:57,460 --> 02:14:02,160
will have to participate in that you can send those emails with your top 25 games

1935

out of here tonight

1943
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:35,920
DarkSakura it's sort of weird having to correct my own wiki are you at the OLR

1944
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:40,240
wiki I am and I just had to actually change something because I said that I

1945
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:44,360
was I got my name in high school it was actually in college I haven't looked at

1946
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:49,400
the wiki in a while you know I was looking at it out of you know not a bad

1947
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:53,880
job though yeah it's all really good I mean it's growing I'm really mine just

1948
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:59,120
the last time I looked at it mine just said tune into this show to hear about

1949
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:05,560
Rob's life I thought was funny link to my myspace that's cute cuz I never

1950
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:11,680
updated anymore I will say this my final thought my final thought is shit cakes

1951
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:20,760
I think that the different levels and this is a different difficulty so I was

1952
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:26,320
gonna play him in order but apparently one's like a level five and five-star

1953
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:30,560
that's kind of hard to get my ass kicked pretty quick I still want to see a

1954
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:34,760
little more about this game do you have a can't use the video thing that I tried

1955
02:15:34,760 --> 02:15:38,600
that later cuz I there was an update that they allowed like PlayStation

1956
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:42,480
Network software to do to be able to output but it's only a classic

1957
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:47,160
PlayStation games and that sucks that's bullshit

1958
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:50,240
