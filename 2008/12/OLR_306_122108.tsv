16543	16964	and so on.
31874	33435	Happy Holidays, y'all!
33475	36177	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36237	42902	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43062	45343	My name is Rob Roberts.
45723	48705	Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Santa, Jamie Summers.
49166	49406	What?
50207	51467	Dark Sakura, of course.
51507	51968	How you doing?
52888	53469	I am.
53869	56351	I'm doing, um, crampy.
56571	57572	Ho, ho, ho.
58192	59353	Bah, fucking humbug.
60646	63768	Try having cramps around Christmas, you'll curse your uterus.
64388	66029	Did Santa bring you cramps for Christmas?
66549	67449	That and a migraine.
67509	68570	Maybe you were a bad girl.
69090	69770	Fuck I was.
69790	73112	I'd rather have coal because then I could light it on fire and be warm.
74733	77754	Say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
77934	78294	Hello.
78595	80696	One of Santa's elves joining us from North Pole.
81356	81656	Yes.
83037	83917	That's correct.
84517	85378	Highly accurate.
85698	86718	How are you this week?
86919	87699	I'm doing fine.
87799	89240	Anything exciting planned for the holidays?
89860	89960	Um.
90996	91356	Yes.
93118	93639	All right, then.
94720	95661	You tell us about it?
95821	97003	I will in just a minute.
97363	98384	Oh, well, okay, then.
98504	103490	Well, you should already know what it is, but there's lots of stuff leading up to that.
103970	106253	Well, sometimes I play stupid for the sake of the listeners.
106313	106773	Oh, I'm sorry.
106813	109196	It gets you to retell the story, even though you might have already told me.
109556	111158	Sometimes I don't know when you're pretending.
111178	111919	Radio magic.
112259	112840	Radio magic.
113180	115782	There's commentary in the chat room, Rob, about you saying y'all.
116003	117984	Ah, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
118044	119225	Do they not like the y'all?
119345	120066	Am I not allowed to say that?
120086	120506	You can say it right.
120526	121147	Because I'm from NorCal?
121567	122168	You can say it right.
122488	123489	Oh, what was I supposed to say?
123669	124029	Y'all.
124330	124830	Y'all.
126812	128573	Or, depending on certain parts, you-ins.
129514	129895	You-ins?
130255	130455	Yep.
130975	131296	All right.
132817	135800	And J-Rod in chat wants to point out, my girlfriend also has cramps.
135860	137101	Coincidence or evil plot?
137121	137341	Coincidence.
138724	142426	We're here to make your Christmas suffer a little bit.
142506	143686	Could it be a conspiracy?
143806	147748	Are all the gamer chicks on one big cycle?
147868	150790	Only unless we've all been hanging out in the same room for at least two months.
152670	153691	Did you know, Rob?
154231	155772	Here's your unwanted education.
156272	156753	Oh lordy.
156873	161176	That if you get women living in the same place for long enough, their cycles will align.
161316	161857	No, I've heard it.
161917	162397	No, I've heard it.
162437	163438	That's why I was making the joke.
163818	169443	That all the gaming girls, you know, like somehow via Xbox Live, I don't know, have all gotten on the same cycle.
169603	171285	Man, that must suck in college.
173887	176809	Yeah, actually, because... It's like, everybody hide!
176889	179852	It's the two... No, it was actually true for my dorm.
180552	181113	I can bet.
181313	182374	Because I had a suite.
183234	184956	So me, my roommate, and our suite mate...
185967	189250	We're all like, chocolate, wine, now!
190972	195176	Of course, we were poor, so it was, you know, Strawberry Hill or Apple Wine.
196517	197038	Mad Dog?
197718	199060	Yeah.
199120	202483	We at least had the taste to get the tasty Boone's Farm stuff.
203304	203584	Nice.
204325	204885	And Everclear.
204905	207288	Because it was Alabama, and you could get Everclear.
207988	208289	Alright.
209497	213879	Anyhow, look, we're going to get into how was your gaming week as we always start off the show.
214180	217081	Not how was your vagina, but how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
217501	218962	How was your gaming week?
219062	220063	I played Vagina Wars.
220183	220623	What?
220643	220863	Nothing.
225703	230707	I actually turned on my DS and then turned it right off when I got a phone call and forgot to play again.
231528	234050	I played some Ragnarok, because I'm still playing!
235651	241676	And I've decided that I might actually go back to World of Warcraft for just a little bit, just to see what the new expansion's like.
242116	243618	But I really don't think I'll stick with it.
243758	247441	It's more of a, eh, why not, while I'm waiting for the Star Trek MMO.
248342	253485	I'm going to warn you, if you're not at least level 55 in World of Warcraft, you won't see anything in the new expansion.
253665	255486	It's all endgame content and a new class.
255726	256047	That's it.
256907	258628	So, sadly, there won't be a lot there for you.
258668	259829	I want to play a Draenei.
260769	261530	Draeneis are fun.
262771	266453	And name her... I don't know.
266493	267633	I had a name I was going to name her.
267653	272496	Because the Draenei women talk like Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle.
273517	275138	Boris Luke is moose in school.
275678	276979	He's fearless leader, darling.
279527	280868	I guess that would suit.
284489	284709	What?
285969	290111	I am going to, in the next week, download Cho Inaki.
291171	292271	Oh, I know what else it was!
294312	296693	I actually sat and watched a playthrough of Abadox.
297693	298153	And how was that?
299234	300474	Just as shitty as I remember.
302145	303066	Loki, how was your gaming week?
303106	304527	I played more Grand Theft Auto on PC
330399	337043	and I've actually started tweaking some stuff now because they've made it a little bit easier for you to actually edit stuff in the game.
337283	338504	You just kind of have to know what you're doing.
338524	343447	It's a little bit like the cheat device was on the Grand Theft Auto on PSP.
343887	344768	Similar type of stuff.
344828	347490	You have a file that you edit some of the amounts with.
347830	351392	Actually, it's a lot easier on the PC version because everything is labeled for you.
351492	357316	So I made a pistol that would catch a cop car and fire in one shot and that was funny.
358256	360758	Um, but just, um, some of that stuff.
360798	364000	Then the game crashed because I shot too many cars and caught them on fire.
364301	366582	Apparently I didn't like that much fire at one time.
367883	374948	Um, but it's kind of like finding a balance, you know, between, um, crazy shit and, uh... Between fuego and non...
375461	388505	Yeah, well, see, my next thing I want to do is, because you can make your gunfire have so much kickback to it, like if you shoot somebody, it'll knock them over, or you can make them, like, fly away and that type of stuff.
388805	397969	So I want to do that, but I also want to have the trainer where I have infinite health, so I can basically, you know, catapult myself with rockets, you know, across the map.
398029	398629	That might be fun.
399489	402111	So, you know, eventually I'll do that.
402211	404333	But there aren't that many mods out there for it right now.
404353	410177	There's like a drifting mod, a mod that changes the car names to, I guess, realistic cars.
410477	415321	And then, you know, the rocket pistol thing, which I was trying to do that myself.
415401	420045	And the first time it glitched out where I actually couldn't select that pistol anymore.
420105	421726	But then I figured out what I was doing wrong.
421806	422907	And I don't know.
423367	426009	It's just not quite to where I need it to be yet.
426750	428151	But soon it will be.
429306	444792	and then of course more Grand Theft Auto 4 multiplayer at work and that's still fun and other than Grand Theft Auto I've been playing Dissida the new Final Fantasy fighting game and it's
446172	448934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
471855	474776	in a gentle way that you appreciate it.
474796	475456	It's gentle rape.
476396	478797	It's just like, oh my god, this is awesome.
479197	480598	That can't be rape if you're willing.
481918	486880	So just say that maybe it's a bit of sadism.
487380	487660	I see.
488460	493122	It would be like a hot chick all of a sudden getting naked and thrusting herself upon you.
493682	497043	But see, at first you're kind of like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here?
497083	497843	But then you just go with it.
499024	499224	So...
500411	502553	I wouldn't know, I haven't had that happen
513054	520017	Put it on the PS3 or something like that, and then also expand upon it, because Dissida is basically fighting, that's all it is.
520057	525319	They have a little bit of cutscenes and stuff like that, but there's no actual roleplaying and running around and that kind of stuff.
525839	537103	But they kept the fighting system in here, and say they did a Kingdom Hearts type of thing where you have all the different characters from the different games, they could really have a kickass game on their hands, but Dissida itself is going to be really awesome.
537842	545471	DJ Dark Knight in chat at chat.orange.com jokes Dissida, aka Urgeis2 No, it's not even close to Urgeis.
546252	546633	No way.
548655	550718	It's not even remotely close.
551823	551983	A.A.A.A.
578493	579374	No, he has no name.
579394	580294	It's just the Warrior of Light.
580615	582576	Or Poop, if it's my cartridge.
582916	583977	No, it's not Poop.
585938	591122	But it's cool, though, because as you level up the characters, they level up in all the other levels that they appear in as well.
592083	595125	I think I did have a party in Final Fantasy because I'm this mature.
595165	597487	I think it was Ass, Assy, Butt, and Poop.
600031	614498	I think the last time when we played it on, because I have the WonderSwan one in Japanese, I actually sat down and tried to figure out the names to put in it in Katakana, so we had Dan, Jamie.
615298	619821	Dan made Eric for some reason, one of his buddies who's kind of not all that bright.
620881	622382	And I don't remember who we named the last one.
624303	628665	My Chrono Trigger cartridge actually still has my friend's save on it that has me and there's Luca.
629468	636609	But seriously though, like, you know, not to interrupt or anything, this game could be like Kingdom Hearts, but without...
637196	638797	I don't know, it's in Japanese, so I can't read that.
638817	639897	But maybe he did in Japanese.
639937	640297	I don't know.
668211	668731	All righty then.
668991	671092	Anything else you've been playing this week?
672352	673032	Animal Crossing.
673613	675013	Played a little more Animal Crossing.
675993	677574	I don't know why I'm still playing Animal Crossing.
677614	678934	I need to come visit Nelly's Village.
679294	679594	I know.
679774	684976	Well, the thing is, I tried... You know, I don't understand this.
685196	688977	Apparently you have to talk to some idiot in the town to get a friend code.
689853	690293	What the fuck?
690313	691654	You have to talk to the guy at the gate.
691694	693734	That's how you've done it in all the last versions, too.
694014	698356	Okay, that's great, but why the hell do I have to talk to somebody who has a friend code assigned to the game?
698376	698836	That's stupid.
698856	702517	Because that way it connects to Nintendo Wi-Fi.
703137	704638	It also is different per player.
705698	710540	Yeah, and so once you get it from Nintendo Wi-Fi, then you can access it whenever in the game.
710560	711780	So you just have to do it that one time.
712560	715061	So I have to do that, but I haven't gone around to that yet.
716162	716562	I will, though.
716822	717062	Awesome.
717898	718378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
743320	744861	Unpsychopedia is so strange.
744881	748903	There's also a picture of one of the little aliens bursting out of someone's stomach.
748923	752764	There's this picture taken by hospital staff one minute after Lavos was born.
753045	754345	Cute little scamp, wasn't he?
755346	757367	I think somebody in chat made a Lavos joke.
757387	759848	Something about, oh, Dan Shadow says, you think that's fun?
759888	761949	Try playing Chrono Trigger and name everyone Lavos.
764010	765311	I don't know what that's supposed to do.
765791	769733	Anyway, the only new game I played this week was the free game.
770053	773255	I love free games, and there was a free game that hit Xbox Live this week.
773315	776376	I don't know if you all remember, but it's Doritos Dash of Destruction.
776936	781679	I think it's an XNA game that somebody made, or it was a concept for a game.
781719	783119	It won some type of contest.
783259	784660	I don't know if it was an XNA contest.
784700	788702	Yeah, Doritos made people try to come up with a concept for a game, and then they made a Doritos game.
789062	790023	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
814301	814902	It could be anything.
815502	818184	Or you can play a T-Rex and chase said trucks.
818544	821086	So it's kind of an interesting little cat and mouse concept.
821126	824669	And I've got to say, it's better than Yaris as far as free games go.
825290	826691	Is this something I would have paid money for?
827930	828871	Probably not.
829091	830752	Maybe $5.
830952	831652	Maybe.
832153	839658	But it's that cute little cat and mouse thing going on where you can play the truck, try and do the deliveries, or you can go in and out and try to eat the trucks.
840118	841699	And that made it kind of fun.
842620	845582	But I don't think it's anything that's going to have a lasting value to it.
845622	847243	A lot of the levels kind of look the same.
847623	851486	Plus you just would unexplainably get these power-ups that didn't seem to do a whole lot of anything.
852286	855128	And the game was handing out achievements like candy.
855368	857690	It was really one of those games where it was like, push start.
857950	858671	Thanks for watching!
876463	877064	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
892659	893960	Texas Hold'em was free for a little while.
921519	922339	You're marbles!
923220	924060	Well, besides that.
924841	926962	I mean, like, what on the Xbox 360 did I lose?
927002	928582	I hope it wasn't any of the rock band tracks.
928662	930243	I'm just not gonna notice they're gone.
930763	933205	Or if it was, like, hopefully it was one of, like, the crappy ones.
933605	935086	We can always re-download them.
935486	935926	That's true.
936006	937927	What about the original rock band songs, though?
938507	941248	Uh, you'd have to re-download them unless you, um, sold them.
943010	945072	If you sold it back, then you're kind of screwed there.
945332	946473	I actually never did sell Rock Band back.
946493	949235	I still know people who still have Rock Band if you need it.
949395	949955	I haven't checked.
950035	951756	I haven't checked to see what got corrupted.
951836	954138	But I haven't played Rock Band since the transfer.
954178	958661	So that was probably the largest chunk of my old hard drive was Rock Band songs.
958681	960623	Because I have a lot of Rock Band songs.
961023	967087	Because I have the Rock Band 1 exported, the entire No Doubt album, and just like at least 20 download songs on top of that.
967207	968388	So pretty crazy.
968869	969869	Well, I finally bought a...
972412	977613	A hard drive transfer thing that's not part of Microsoft's transfer kit.
977673	980594	It's actually something to dump files to your hard drive and that kind of stuff.
981634	996198	To get, well, on top of potential modding things, to basically move the two PopCap games saves that PopCap for some reason said, No, you can't transfer to a memory unit.
996378	997979	We're going to be dicks about that.
998823	1002147	And then, yeah, I love how on Twitter they're like, oh yeah, we're looking into that.
1003950	1005612	He thinks we're looking into that.
1005652	1008635	I saw you got a response, though, that was basically they couldn't figure it out.
1009389	1011631	No, their response was like, you have to re-download the game.
1011651	1014653	I'm like, what the fuck does that have to do with my save file, stupid?
1015093	1016975	Not, like, transferring the game.
1017015	1018235	I'm talking about the save file.
1018876	1019716	Well, wait a minute, though.
1019757	1021718	Like, I theorized a couple weeks ago when this first came out.
1021758	1023659	Maybe this is something that was kind of out of their control.
1023719	1025921	Like, you know, they just... It's not out of their control.
1026041	1035568	All the other games before and after them have allowed me to move the save files to a memory unit and, you know, move it to another hard drive.
1036489	1039251	You may not be able to copy them to other profiles.
1039431	1040252	I understand that.
1040292	1041272	That makes perfect sense.
1041392	1044134	But not being able to move it at all, that's retarded.
1044654	1045595	You know what else did that?
1045755	1048236	Hexic HD won't let you move this thing.
1048657	1052359	So, screw you, Microsoft, and screw you, PopCap.
1052719	1053320	That's right, though.
1053380	1054600	I'm going to do it anyways.
1054620	1055641	I will find a way.
1055781	1059824	I know we have people from PopCap that listen, so I hope... Well, then fine!
1059984	1061044	Screw you both!
1061124	1062865	Bejeweled 2 and Zuma...
1063886	1067309	for whatever reason, your stupid save files won't move.
1067529	1076016	Not the game, the game is fine, because I can delete it, download it, move it, whatever I need to do, but the save files will not move.
1076096	1079819	And I'm assuming this is a big crisis in your house, because Zuma is like one of the only games your wife will play.
1079839	1083522	No, it's not a big crisis, but it's annoying, because if my wife... It's the principle of the thing.
1083682	1089026	Yes, we put in a lot of time to Bejeweled 2, which I might add, the achievements are...
1089767	1091108	Damn near impossible to get.
1091628	1094991	But for whatever reason, we put a lot of time into it.
1095471	1096212	Especially Zuma.
1096272	1097553	Zuma gets pretty hard too.
1097913	1099614	At least that I can get some achievements in.
1099654	1101436	But Jewel 2 is a bitch.
1103617	1105879	But yeah, I don't want to lose all my progress in that.
1106179	1106940	It's a game.
1107040	1108621	I don't care if it's a crappy game.
1108841	1110682	It's still progress and I don't want to lose it.
1111363	1112844	But in the fact that
1113760	1114541	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1121988	1122048	S.S.J.
1122068	1126369	100 Matt wants to point out now if Nelly lost her Excite Truck save file then shit would hit the fan.
1126429	1128769	Yes, but it might give her another reason to play it again.
1148108	1153551	I do want to say, though, since Matt brought up PopCap, I did play the new Bejeweled thing on Facebook.
1153831	1158473	They have like a Bejeweled tournament thing on Facebook where you get like a minute to get as many points as you can.
1158913	1163355	And right now, I'm on the top of the leaderboard, at least of my friends list, because you can't see everybody.
1163395	1164276	You can see your friends list.
1164296	1166257	I got 55,000 in one minute.
1167057	1168498	I got really lucky with the chains.
1168538	1169258	That's all I can say.
1169638	1171599	But I thought that was kind of cute that they put that on Facebook.
1172980	1175941	Anyhow, so anything else for Gaming Weeks around?
1176402	1176722	Anybody?
1177222	1178042	I played rock band.
1178703	1179503	Like the first one.
1179763	1180023	Yeah.
1180163	1181184	Because that's what Julie got.
1181804	1185125	And I have to say I've forgotten how much I hate the rock band guitars.
1185965	1188746	But now I remember because it was forced upon me.
1189207	1189807	And I hate them.
1190307	1190727	Why is that?
1190987	1192488	They're flimsy.
1193208	1197450	They may be better for strumming, but most of the time the keys stick on both of them.
1198270	1200451	And they wouldn't sync properly for the wireless one.
1200511	1202051	And it was just a pain in the ass.
1202151	1206373	And next time I go over there, I'm bringing my Guitar Hero controllers.
1208354	1208614	All righty.
1208634	1209676	I did watch a lot of Netflix stuff.
1210657	1210897	I know.
1210937	1212579	Isn't the Netflix thing on 360 great?
1212779	1216263	I watched a documentary this week because now Netflix... On penguins?
1216784	1216884	No.
1217264	1221669	Netflix got smart and they added an HD category on their Watch Instantly thing.
1221689	1222710	So I was looking at HD movies.
1223011	1226595	And I watched a documentary because I've been all about the obscure documentaries on Netflix.
1226615	1227055	I don't know why.
1227375	1229097	But I watched an obscure documentary about...
1229798	1233460	The people that dress up as superheroes on Hollywood Boulevard and post for pictures.
1233821	1236422	I think it's called Confessions of a Superhero was the name of the movie.
1237063	1238444	And it was interesting.
1238904	1240685	It was interesting seeing the reasons why people did it.
1240765	1242827	Some did it because they were obsessed with their character.
1243167	1245388	Some people did it just for another job.
1245749	1248170	Some people did it because they have issues.
1248610	1249151	A lot of issues.
1249331	1252333	Rob, I want to come over and watch documentaries with you now that I don't have school.
1252473	1252893	It's fun.
1253454	1254234	Except I have work.
1254354	1254955	That's the sad thing.
1254975	1255415	I have work.
1256235	1257136	But not every day.
1257156	1257796	I have work.
1258257	1258597	Yeah, I know.
1259468	1261281	I'm going to come watch documentaries with you.
1261567	1261807	All right.
1261847	1262268	Well, it's fun.
1262388	1263388	Well, documentary night.
1264469	1266511	We'll try to see who can find the most obscure documentary.
1266531	1268412	Because there are some obscure documentaries on Netflix.
1268432	1272175	Speaking of documentaries, I got a screener copy of E!
1272335	1279460	Athletes, which if I remember correctly, I think that's the film that Scott Rubin actually did some of the shooting for.
1279480	1281102	It's about those two Counter-Strike teams.
1282302	1286526	And they came to Eldorado Hills to do part of the tournament there.
1286566	1289728	And he was filming a second unit or whatever on that.
1290308	1290969	That was kind of neat.
1292239	1293561	Tiger Claw Confessions of a Superhero
1309617	1310558	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1327086	1337791	Maybe that sounds cruel, but I just didn't see... Her costume was decent, but I just didn't see... She did not look like Wonder Woman as much as Batman looked like Batman or Superman looked like Superman.
1337811	1340532	There was only one Wonder Woman ever.
1341592	1343193	And she was in the 70s.
1343773	1347095	And she was freaking fantastic, and I really enjoyed seeing her in Sky High.
1349335	1351436	You were going to say something, Loki?
1351456	1351636	No.
1351676	1358659	I thought I've actually seen part of that show or something that had to do with those people that were on Hollywood Boulevard.
1359079	1359399	You might.
1359559	1361820	A hostile one in chat says, I've seen that doc.
1361880	1364441	They even said that people were protective.
1364481	1366822	Like, I'm the only one who can play Superman on this block.
1367402	1367643	Yeah.
1367683	1368043	Perhaps.
1369244	1370905	Elmo wants some money for drugs!
1370925	1371305	Give Elmo money!
1398303	1399184	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1416542	1424228	Bobby, the man who does the show before us, is doing his annual year-end special next week, and he's going to have some guests on his show and all that fun stuff.
1424868	1429572	He might be starting a little early, and we might let him run a little late to help out.
1429592	1429812	We are?
1430152	1430613	Yeah, maybe.
1430633	1430813	Vito!
1430833	1431553	Just a little.
1431794	1432214	Just a little.
1432254	1432414	Kidding.
1433095	1433615	So we'll see.
1433855	1437398	But that means, it made me realize, that means next week is our year-end show.
1438459	1440841	I wasn't even thinking about it, but yeah, next week's the year-end show.
1441261	1441881	Can you believe it?
1442582	1444663	Yes, because it comes the same time every year.
1444984	1445184	Yeah.
1445994	1452058	And there will be no show on the week of January 11th.
1452558	1453399	There is no show.
1454099	1454820	I'm going to be in Hawaii.
1455000	1456461	I will not be here the weekend of the 31st.
1456961	1457141	What?
1457702	1458882	Because I'm going to Disneyland.
1459503	1461964	Presents.
1462004	1462185	Yay.
1462225	1463345	We should do our gift exchange.
1463505	1464066	I may go.
1464166	1464406	Okay.
1464526	1466467	I feel bad, though, because I didn't get gifts today.
1466968	1467188	Thank you.
1467208	1467568	Wait, wait, wait.
1467588	1468028	Don't go anywhere.
1468409	1473452	I am doing something different and experimental this year for Christmas.
1473472	1473552	Okay.
1475507	1476888	I already gave you part of yours already.
1476908	1479190	I know, I was going to say, I thought Prince of Persia was my gift.
1479310	1481032	Well, no, not Prince of Persia, Animal Crossing.
1481052	1482353	Prince of Persia, that was a freebie.
1482513	1482993	That too.
1484855	1486336	Yeah, you've already got me a gift, Loki.
1486536	1487417	Yeah, but this is cool, though.
1487457	1489279	I saw this at the store and I had to get it for you.
1489379	1490300	All right, yay, gifts.
1490800	1491921	Sorry we don't have a camera tonight.
1492041	1492862	This sucks for TV.
1493562	1493823	All right.
1495564	1496104	Thank you.
1497986	1501069	Don't worry, HitStun, we will not cut off the Bobby Blackwolf show.
1501109	1502530	If they go a little long, we'll deal.
1503330	1503971	Star Trek Pez Dispensers
1522523	1523723	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1546747	1561973	I have to, actually, I was, because the artwork is a different style, and so I wasn't looking at the character designs, I was reading Ragu no Raku on I was like, oh shit, because I read like an illiterate, you know, child.
1562353	1562854	Very nice.
1562874	1563334	In Japanese.
1564334	1565355	I gave Rob sparklies.
1565895	1567275	Wait, oh, I'm opening it right now.
1567415	1569156	Oh, there's glitter and glitter and more glitter.
1573798	1575219	Oh my god, this looks awesome.
1575459	1576179	You're welcome.
1577284	1580985	Dude, it's like, oh, I've seen this in the store before.
1581505	1583286	It's the Press Your Luck DVD game.
1583846	1584967	Play at home edition.
1585467	1585907	Awesome.
1586507	1590388	Now, I was going to get you the prices right, but I didn't think you liked Drew Carey so much.
1590649	1591209	He's all right.
1591869	1595130	And so it didn't have Bob Barker or, you know, dude.
1595190	1596691	Dude, but Press Your Luck is epic.
1596711	1597531	It's old school.
1597611	1598411	That's amazing.
1598431	1598751	I made sure.
1598931	1599792	That's amazing.
1601152	1603713	Well, it does have the new host, but seeing as the other one died.
1603733	1604553	But it's got the old whammy.
1604573	1605834	Yeah, it has the old whammy.
1605874	1606694	That is amazing.
1607881	1608261	That's cool.
1608281	1609781	We're going to play a DVD game or something?
1609801	1610101	Yeah.
1610141	1610782	Want to check that out?
1610822	1611122	The box?
1611322	1613182	Yep.
1613302	1616943	I got, I got, I got, um, well, Matt, tell your president.
1617363	1617663	Okay.
1618063	1618843	I couldn't think of what to get you.
1618863	1619563	I want to read the card, too.
1619583	1620744	So I tried to get you something useful.
1620904	1621324	That's fine.
1621744	1622344	I appreciate it.
1622884	1623284	Here you go.
1624144	1625224	That's pretty cool there, Rob.
1626185	1627345	Yes, I don't know what that book is.
1627485	1632986	I didn't want to open it, you know, so I don't know if that's a manual or like an art book or something that they threw in there.
1633006	1634206	I'm going to open it right now.
1635026	1637707	Oh, but I figured, you know, Ragnarok
1639704	1642166	DJ Dark Knight brought up something about the Price is Right that reminded me.
1642206	1647909	Did you see the, in chat room, did you see the talk about the guy on the Price is Right that nailed the showcase on the head?
1647929	1648589	This is the manual.
1649970	1650170	Yeah.
1650591	1654233	I was joking about how I think that's a giant conspiracy.
1656514	1657495	There's more in my life journal.
1658335	1660997	Hitstun says, does Ragnarok DS have any sort of online play?
1661177	1663819	I think it's a few players, like local.
1666823	1668064	This is fantastic!
1668864	1675469	Because you do your attacks and spellcasting by stylus control.
1680633	1681113	Alright.
1682234	1685196	Well, what a happy holiday we have here on Orange Lounge Radio this week.
1686657	1689279	Except for me, I'm a Grinch, because I didn't give out presents tonight.
1689299	1690320	That's alright, don't worry about it.
1690380	1693082	Well, I'm doing something different this year.
1693102	1693622	Oh, nice!
1693802	1695864	It has the skill trees in here.
1696215	1701817	I just didn't want to forget these all in my house and I started to get to the point now where I'm like, whose gift is that?
1702037	1702857	Whose gift is that?
1703497	1704777	Oh crap, I gotta get rid of these.
1705057	1705257	Nice.
1706618	1707438	Alright, woo!
1708698	1710759	Now that we've all been bitten by Christmas spirit.
1710779	1713180	There's two classes that are just for the DS.
1715360	1718141	We're gonna hear little tidbits about Ragnarok DS all night long.
1718161	1720342	There's Dark Knight.
1721122	1725423	Yeah, in fact, DJ Dark Knight in chat says Jamie wishes she could bring her online character to the DS game.
1726874	1732778	You know what, my characters are like over 120 something right now, so, because I'm playing on a private server.
1732798	1735680	Yeah, I was going to say, plus you play on bootleg servers, so I don't think that would be a coach.
1735700	1737101	Dude, Dark Knight's fucking hot.
1737321	1742125	I like J-Rod, Star Trek, Pez, Spencer, what a thoughtful way to carry around your ecstasy.
1744346	1745047	That's amazing.
1746442	1747463	Star Trek Pest Dispensers
1767355	1768716	I was like, dude, I gotta pick this up for Rob.
1769016	1769456	That's amazing.
1769596	1778880	Yeah, I thought about getting you another Imagine game this year for the DS, but I figured I'd actually give you something useful instead of, you know... I'm putting pictures up in a second.
1779580	1779820	Sweet.
1780440	1781861	Alright, so, wait, is that going on your Twitter?
1782521	1782781	Alright.
1783041	1789244	Well, I'll link the picture in the chat room because my Twitter's blocked from almost everybody, so... Oh, you can log into the OLR one if you want.
1789264	1789504	Alright.
1790825	1792846	Let's move on and get into some gaming news.
1793666	1801189	We're going to go from such happy, joyous, wonderful news to not-so-great news tonight.
1801789	1808871	I want you to listen to the first stories in tonight's show and see if they all have something in common because it's kind of sad, actually.
1809131	1812693	It's kind of a bummer we have to follow up such positive stuff with this.
1813873	1816194	Factor 5 has closed its doors.
1816574	1819515	The developer known for such games as Lair...
1820405	1825226	and some better games as Star Wars Rogue Squadron and even like the Turrican series.
1826107	1832068	And apparently they were being rumored to be working on the new Kid Icarus and Superman games.
1833129	1834869	But they have closed their... Superman 128?
1835409	1836810	It's the Curse of Spider-Man.
1836910	1838210	I'm sorry, it's Superman, I tell you.
1839657	1842580	It's a new Superman, not tying in with the movie.
1844422	1854875	So they have closed their doors, and it was supposedly confirmed by Matt Casamani from IGN, who had, I believe, received an email from...
1856156	1858038	and Julian at Factor 5.
1858078	1859879	It says, Hi Matt, how have you been?
1861520	1864162	Wanted to contact you with some late-breaking news.
1864222	1869306	We just learned Inside Sources that developer Factor 5 has officially closed the doors as of today.
1869386	1873249	That's some pretty big news considering that those guys have been around for quite a while.
1873729	1877572	It's definitely a real shame and I hope this information is helpful to you.
1878253	1879894	Dude, you know who we have to blame for this?
1880214	1880494	Lair?
1881495	1882776	No, Ronald Reagan.
1883096	1883376	Why?
1883396	1884257	Reaganomics.
1886972	1891234	Seriously, that's one of the big contributors to our financial crisis right now.
1891374	1896776	Well, perhaps it continues on in these other stories we're getting into, such as about Electronic Arts.
1898997	1901298	Electronic Arts had to cut 1,000 jobs and closed
1903539	1907460	Black Box Studio in Vancouver is going to be merged with the EA Studio in nearby Burnaby.
1931825	1941048	Wow, so this is going to save the company $120 million annually, but costing them about $60 million in restructuring charges while this goes on.
1942428	1944849	Kind of a bummer for those folks that got laid off.
1945249	1945969	Sorry to hear about it.
1945989	1947190	I had some friends that worked at EA.
1947230	1947890	I have no idea.
1948430	1954532	They're not people I talk to every day, so I don't know if anybody I know is affected by this, but still, my thoughts are with you guys.
1955012	1955932	This is very unfortunate.
1957321	1960722	Well, there actually is going for Midway too.
1960882	1970965	The rumor was that they were going to be laying off around 160 people from the Chicago studio for the most part because of financial issues.
1972285	1976926	The official word is that they're laying 25% off of its workforce.
1977426	1978047	So that's about 180 people.
1980568	1983570	130 people from Chicago and 45 from Austin.
1984771	1986752	The Austin operation itself has closed.
1987413	1994358	And then there's supposed to be some other games that were unannounced that are being suspended.
1994839	1999682	So they're just trying to, I guess, mitigate whatever the costs are.
1999903	2001784	Apparently the Mortal Kombat team is safe.
2001824	2006107	We can all sleep easy, I think.
2006948	2007368	Whatever.
2008489	2008969	It's just crap.
2011719	2016964	and even more upsetting for me, Free Radical has closed shop.
2017605	2027374	Apparently their doors were locked and all the employees were locked out while the company was having some final meetings deciding what the fate of the company was going to be.
2028095	2030357	Of course, Free Radical is known for the
2031138	2031859	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2048547	2052150	The good news is, though, is they may not be out of work for long.
2052270	2063678	Apparently, some other companies are looking to purchase Free Radical and kind of absorb them into their, you know, developing firms.
2064278	2066920	So that's kind of good because I want to see TimeSplitters 4.
2067401	2070323	It was kind of neat since they were, you know,
2071095	2072196	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2099810	2100130	Wow.
2100510	2101511	Yeah.
2102151	2114695	So I guess the new studio had been formed a few months before this whole, I guess, thing happened.
2114775	2118756	So this was working out before everything.
2118796	2123997	Maybe he kind of figured that this was going to happen anyways and so kind of a precautionary measure.
2126298	2128799	That's what I'm wondering if this guy didn't kind of see the writing on the wall.
2129448	2140712	GameGuru in chat says this is what happens when you don't support the console that won that's the Wii my friends wait a minute look at EA they just laid off a bunch of people they've been big supporters of the Wii right?
2140732	2141392	even sort of yeah
2156098	2159099	GameGuru says the economic crisis just accelerated the problem.
2159719	2163641	I can't really say Free Radical wasn't supporting the Wii.
2163661	2167062	They've only made one game since the new consoles have come out, you know, Haze.
2167763	2170864	So that's not really fair.
2172008	2178071	Well, another company seems to be cutting back on staff.
2178231	2180713	Asper is the name of the company and they are based out of Austin.
2181393	2183374	They're probably most known for some of their porting work.
2183414	2187036	They ported Call of Duty 4 and Sims 2 to the PC and the Mac respectively.
2187396	2188197	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2203857	2207381	Wow, so no comments out of Asper.
2208142	2211806	I should note, though, that that story was just a rumor status only.
2212507	2217352	However, it unfortunately would not be surprising considering all the other news we're hearing this week.
2218635	2218875	Ouch.
2218895	2220015	Ouch.
2246311	2248839	Yeah, in other words, they're like, oh, fuck, bye.
2248860	2249120	Really.
2251428	2251689	Really.
2253126	2255468	Dan got laid off in the money store.
2282621	2282881	Really?
2283241	2283802	Is that what happens?
2283862	2284142	Similar?
2284182	2289064	They just went in, found a bunch of people walking out with stuff, and so they're like, just pack your desks and go.
2290205	2290445	Wow.
2290485	2291865	My gosh.
2291885	2293186	And then they bribed us to stay.
2295387	2296347	Here's my question.
2296607	2297528	Is this going to continue?
2297568	2299149	I mean, this was six in a week.
2299289	2302790	Are we going to see more throughout the next few weeks, or what's going to happen?
2303030	2304231	Blame Reagan, blame Bush.
2308153	2308673	Who's next?
2310217	2311218	and the Republicans.
2311658	2312559	Well, wait a minute, though.
2312579	2313940	Let's not get too political here.
2314961	2332614	Well, seriously, if you look at it historically, the reason why we're in all this financial shit is because of Reagan's whole Reaganomics crap and the fact that people have decided just to screw us over instead of putting money back into the economy where it goes.
2332814	2335596	We're spending money on a war we didn't need to spend money on.
2337037	2364962	and all this other bullshit it just should have looked out what the country needs and go for the best thing and now as a result we're seeing and it's not just this there's other companies like I went to Old Folsom today and I say yesterday and at least a third of the old shops there were either closed or going out of business the coffee place I go to they close down without a word it's just you're seeing more and more businesses closing down it's not just in the video game industry
2365785	2369967	Regardless of whatever path we took to get here, how are we going to get out?
2370307	2372108	I guess would be my question.
2372248	2373088	Is the end in sight?
2373168	2374829	Are we going to get out of this anytime soon?
2374889	2375729	What's it going to take?
2376470	2379111	Do we just need to buy more video games or what?
2380700	2383623	Well, it's a lot more complex than that.
2383683	2391590	I mean, a lot of it is going to be consumers, you know, having more faith in the industries and, you know, putting their money into product.
2392270	2399797	But it's also going to mean that to be able to put money into the purchase of products, there need to be the jobs available.
2399837	2401619	So it's very much right now a catch 22.
2401659	2402860	Damn if you do, damn if you don't.
2405422	2420774	It's really going to take, I think, the companies being able to be in a financial position to where they can start hiring again and start putting out more product so that these people who now have fresh incomes can go out and put their money back into the money flow.
2421795	2423316	We'll see what happens in 2009.
2423376	2424597	Hopefully it won't be much longer.
2424798	2425338	We'll see though.
2426377	2426938	Moving on.
2427879	2434688	You know, all this news makes us very sad and upset and angry that all these great game studios are just closing their doors.
2434768	2437091	Well, some not so great, but they're all closing their doors.
2437852	2438473	It just stinks.
2438673	2439554	The whole thing stinks.
2439875	2444561	And so we dedicate the FU's of the week to those without a job this week.
2457797	2458798	My first F.U.
2458838	2462041	goes towards my girl bits for hurting me and causing me pain.
2462561	2469647	Therefore, I have to turn around and hurt other people and cause them pain because they don't have to endure this type of thing, so we have to share it with them somehow.
2471148	2472649	Also, an F.U.
2472709	2484018	goes on behalf of one of my friends who didn't necessarily say this herself, but I'm passing it on for her to the lack of proper transplants for her dad.
2484678	2484858	Loki,
2509144	2512306	F you to rude people at the stores, especially at this time of year.
2512886	2517107	There was some lady in front of us when we were trying to buy some, you know, gifts.
2517708	2520789	And first off, she's taking forever with her transaction.
2521468	2522769	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2549776	2550456	FU the rude people.
2550577	2556000	And then there's a ton of people who can't drive correctly, especially now in the rain, so... Screw them, too.
2558021	2567786	Um, my FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm feeling pains in my side, and I don't know if I'm just imagining it, or if it's something weird happening again, or what have you.
2567806	2568987	I'll try to go to the doctor.
2569027	2570388	Maybe it is my uterus, I don't know.
2570888	2573169	But, you know, I don't know, like, I just get freaked out.
2573409	2574430	It's been a hell of a year.
2574590	2575631	I just want 2008 to go die in a fire.
2576856	2585702	First of all, I would like to tell the entire chat room, don't wish assassination, that's your wishing murder on somebody.
2586183	2594288	However, complete incapacitation of both Bush and Cheney would be fantastic if someone were to do that, because that would put Pelosi in charge until Obama takes over.
2594869	2595769	She is the Speaker of the House.
2596690	2601433	Alright, I want to know, and my other FU goes to selfish people.
2602254	2602554	That's it.
2604711	2617457	In early 2009, we'll be receiving a brand new game from the creator of such wonderful games as Katamari Damacy and all the other sequels.
2618217	2623099	Takahashi is releasing Nobi Nobi Boy on the PlayStation Network.
2623579	2627781	They had a few videos that came out this week for it, and I still don't know what the hell this game's about.
2628241	2631343	It's like you're this stretchy thing that...
2632412	2637596	Try to hook a bunch of things up with your body and I don't know what exactly that's supposed to be for.
2638156	2643720	But apparently you can stretch your body, you can devour things.
2645221	2653287	I'm not really sure what exactly you do, but it's supposed to be coming out in Japan on January 29th for 800 yen.
2654368	2657910	And the US probably around the same time, so early 2009.
2659704	2660285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2669980	2671180	Yeah, but this looks really weird.
2671300	2675341	Like, even, like, Katamari, you know, you can watch a tree and then get it.
2675461	2677882	You know, it's, oh, you roll over things and your ball gets bigger.
2678202	2682923	This is like a giant tube thing eating things and tying things up with its body.
2683703	2684664	I don't get what the point is.
2684684	2685764	That sounds fantastic.
2685844	2687684	It's like Bizarro Snake.
2687844	2689365	It is like a Bizarro Snake.
2689485	2696427	It's like, you know, everyone's, like, all happy and stuff, and then he starts eating people, and it's like, oh my god, this isn't good at all.
2696847	2698087	Eating people is great.
2699807	2700668	Nom, nom, nom.
2700768	2702769	Nobby Nobby's made of people.
2703410	2706452	It's people!
2706472	2708194	Hey, LittleBigPlanet got some updates this week.
2708234	2710996	It got two patches back-to-back, 1.06 and 1.07.
2713318	2719523	1.06, now it upgraded the moderation feature of the game, which a lot of people would say was badly needed.
2720483	2724186	Now, your unpublished levels can be edited by creators.
2724206	2725728	They will not be erased forever.
2726048	2726909	And, believe it or not,
2727830	2728590	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2757023	2757163	What?
2757283	2757863	This is just what?
2757883	2757963	What?
2786446	2792091	I clicked on the link in the chat room that was posted by TigerClaw.
2792131	2793452	Which I think we're covering later in the show.
2793592	2794352	Okay, then never mind.
2796494	2797195	That's what I get.
2798195	2800778	Well, how about some different news about SingStar?
2802018	2805781	They're doing wireless microphones that will be out next year.
2806802	2809725	And they're...
2811750	2823580	Actually saying that there's going to be 100 trial packs also available to, I guess, just a number of different SingStar followers on their MySpace.
2824941	2832987	But the packs are going to be two wireless microphones, USB receiver, a mini BUSB cable, and four AA batteries.
2836210	2838412	I want one for SingStar ABBA, which, by the way...
2839164	2844465	There is now a SingStar ABBA theme in the PlayStation Network store that you can download for your PS3.
2844505	2844705	What?
2845645	2848966	I don't know if we know it all yet, but it's coming out next year.
2849406	2849606	What?
2849686	2853247	Here, that's coming out also in Europe, or may have already come out.
2853327	2853727	What?
2853787	2854567	SingStar Queen.
2855267	2856207	Oh, cool.
2856227	2856447	Nice!
2856567	2858427	I heard there was a Queen one coming out.
2858748	2859488	I'm totally going to buy that.
2859508	2860108	But it's coming out in the U.S.
2860128	2860288	now.
2860748	2861208	Awesome!
2861688	2862648	That is exciting.
2863088	2865109	Queen is all sorts of awesome.
2865169	2866269	Queen is very awesome.
2867169	2869031	It's going to have the videos and everything, I bet, huh?
2869191	2870312	So, Rob, what is your favorite Queen song?
2870332	2871212	That's going to be amazing.
2871573	2878478	You know, I have to stick with the old Bohemian Rhapsody, but I do have a big love for Bicycle.
2879559	2881020	What about you, Matt?
2881060	2886825	Bohemian Rhapsody and No One Wants to Live Forever, I think.
2887305	2891809	My favorite would be Somebody to Love.
2892069	2893350	That's my favorite of all time.
2894090	2894751	Oh, that's a great song.
2894771	2895792	My second is Killer Queen.
2897113	2898054	These are all good songs.
2898274	2899395	I can't wait for this game.
2899415	2900316	It's going to be amazing.
2901197	2902478	You know the only thing that would be better?
2902758	2903659	It would be SingStar Journey.
2903899	2904960	You know I had to say it.
2905000	2905940	SingStar Heart.
2906361	2911265	See, now, it would only be good... I think that they should just do a Queen Pack for Rock Band, because that would be a lot better.
2912606	2914467	They do need to have SingStar Butt Rock.
2915188	2916028	That would be amazing.
2916168	2919051	With Poison and Motley Crue and...
2920871	2921692	That would be sweet.
2923173	2927156	And they'd have to have Cinderella and Dokken and Night Ranger.
2929798	2931879	And damn Yankees because of Ted Nugent.
2934181	2934922	Ted Nugent!
2935202	2937543	Everything's awesome and also from Sony.
2938224	2947071	Pots upon 2 is out in Japan right now, but it will be coming to other regions in early 2009.
2948452	2950173	February in probably North America.
2951000	2954641	And, um... Yeah, Patapon is actually pretty cool.
2954681	2956122	I didn't get to play a lot of the game.
2956182	2959563	I just kind of gave up on it after a while, but it was fun.
2960323	2964604	Definitely a unique little game, and, you know, I'd like to see more in that crazy style.
2964644	2967125	But I'd also like to see it, like, on other systems, you know?
2967185	2969565	I don't want to have to always bring out the PSP to play this.
2970866	2971686	Port that shit.
2972646	2974167	Because it'd look awesome on the PS3.
2976387	2978068	Patapatapatapon!
2978841	2980563	It was a very interesting little game.
2981024	2982366	Rob, I'm cold.
2982826	2989875	It would be even better if the buttons spelled out or sung out Damn Yankee songs.
2990436	2990956	That'd be great.
2991717	2991737	I...
2992967	2994908	Hate everything about your mother.
2995368	2996449	That wasn't Damn Yankees.
2996749	2999150	No, I'm thinking Ugly Kid Joe.
2999270	2999670	I'm sorry.
2999710	3002572	I'm thinking High Enough was Damn Yankees, wasn't it?
3002592	3004133	Because it's fucking Ted Nugent.
3006974	3009475	Ted Nugent eats meat and shoots guns.
3010336	3011216	I like this man.
3014618	3016799	I saw him on TV skinning a deer.
3019640	3020901	Ted Nugent's fucking hot.
3023050	3028951	Unfortunately, you won't be able to skin a deer in LittleBigPlanet, but you will get paint guns, which is kind of cool.
3029211	3032852	I do have a challenge out there for you folks to make a level where you do skin a deer.
3033432	3034372	You can probably do that.
3035373	3037533	I have to actually go back to Ranma.
3038253	3039733	Queensryche is the shit.
3040374	3041134	Although you misspelled it.
3041514	3044775	Because the lead singer of Queensryche is a trained opera singer.
3045315	3047175	And he's just got this fantastic voice.
3047415	3047895	Anyway, I'm sorry.
3048135	3048515	That's all right.
3048555	3051316	I would like to see Sackboy's House of Blood in...
3052987	3053788	and LittleBigPlanet.
3053808	3056049	I want to see some really disturbing levels.
3056249	3067676	One time, and I just never got around to actually trying to make anything in this game, but thought about it, making a Saw-themed level, but I couldn't figure out how I could do that.
3070035	3070816	I don't know.
3070836	3071016	It is.
3071036	3071256	But so why...
3096039	3097623	Why then are there these new trophies?
3097724	3101413	Because shouldn't I get to play it still if somebody else makes the level using it?
3101433	3102375	Or am I going to get locked out?
3102475	3102916	Here's the thing.
3104031	3105612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3131428	3132789	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3158544	3159605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3179248	3181329	The Holiday Pack is now apparently out.
3181349	3183669	It was supposed to come out December 18th for $2.99.
3184489	3194491	And it's the Festive Level Pack, and it's supposed to contain two new costumes, some new material, new objects, six new decorations, and tons and tons and tons of new stickers.
3194831	3198552	But however, with this pack, levels themselves are not apparently included.
3200093	3201353	But they just have the stickers, though.
3201833	3201993	Yeah.
3203618	3210802	So I guess you put this in your own levels or what have you because you can create new Christmas tree looking things and everything with the stickers.
3211122	3215964	Hey, speaking of stickers, when are we going to get that feature where I can put photos from the hard drive into the game?
3216244	3218626	Because that's the other big thing we're waiting on.
3219366	3220567	But it was in an advertisement.
3220587	3221767	It's false advertising.
3222388	3223068	Bitch, whine, moan.
3224509	3224769	Right?
3224949	3225829	You're never going to get it.
3227010	3227390	I wish.
3227810	3228411	Maybe next year.
3228491	3228791	We'll see.
3229859	3231580	SuperStreetFighter 2 Turbo HD Remix
3243052	3244453	Wow, there's a lot of suckers out there.
3244893	3246273	Well, I have it.
3246393	3247174	I like it.
3247234	3248874	I've got so many different versions of Street Fighter.
3248894	3250395	It's not even funny.
3250455	3253296	That's 250,000 people sucking the cock of nostalgia.
3254576	3264340	It's basically broken both day one and week one sales records and is slated to break 30-day sale records as well.
3264440	3265240	So it's supposed to be the...
3267681	3272844	Actually, according to Capcom, it's quoted as saying it's on its way to becoming the highest-grossing digital title ever.
3273364	3276786	Besides that, they had the good sense to use Udon Kru to do their art, so that's pretty cool.
3279828	3280188	Very cool.
3280208	3281229	They didn't sell one to me.
3282570	3287773	Well, unfortunately, this week, there aren't that many choices for you to go purchase stuff.
3287813	3295197	I mean, it is the week of Christmas, and a lot of game publishers aren't exactly putting their games out this week because...
3296752	3298333	That's not a lot of time to purchase them.
3298453	3302275	But there are a few that are putting out their games.
3302515	3306898	And, well, they're games, alright.
3308079	3312181	Candice Kane's Candy Factory on the DS is coming out this week.
3312381	3314402	Also, the Spore comic book creator.
3314843	3316183	I don't really know if that's a game.
3316224	3317884	That's more software, I think.
3318485	3320386	But it's coming out nonetheless.
3322447	3323528	Let's see here.
3326876	3333198	and Mystery PI Portrait of a Thief on DS.
3335399	3337279	And I swear that I think that's it.
3338940	3339580	That is it.
3339840	3341461	That is sad.
3344764	3345325	Thanks for watching!
3364173	3367654	Also, on the PlayStation 3, you also get Alone in the Dark.
3368094	3374996	Far Cry 2 and Bioshock get their Japanese translations, as well as another port of Civ Revolution.
3375536	3376936	But also some other games.
3377236	3380497	White Knight Chronicles is coming out this week, as well as another game.
3380517	3381257	I have no idea what this is.
3381917	3383258	Oh, it's an actual gaming stick.
3383298	3383978	Okay, it's not a game.
3384038	3385038	It's like joystick.
3385078	3387199	They call the... Don't laugh.
3387259	3388739	It's the Roid Stick DS.
3389119	3389599	So there you go.
3391280	3393140	There were a couple games I missed, but I don't...
3393996	3402831	Fun Fun Mini Golf on the Wii Tiki Towers on the Wii I think those are both download games and then Dreamer Horse Trainer and Dreamer Puppy Trainer on DS
3406524	3409207	Peekman gets its Wii upgrade this week as well.
3429639	3430800	or Pikmin, Pikmin, whatever.
3431321	3433103	Maybe that's that Biohazard Zero.
3433724	3435285	That might be what it is.
3435345	3439430	PlayStation 2, Lego Batman comes out this week and that's about it.
3440611	3447259	On the handhelds, you have on the Nintendo DS...
3448393	3452177	Biohazard, Deadly Silence, Happy My Sweets, Phantasy Star Zero, Sony PSP,
3467998	3477785	DJ Maxx Portable, Black Square Cherry Blossom Portable, Biohazard Degeneration I'm totally jealous.
3479287	3493898	Our branch of my work that's in Dallas that houses most of our game reps Genius Products is bringing out that game Scratch to playtest for them You know that new DJing game that's supposed to be like Beatmania?
3494514	3494914	Oh, really?
3495394	3498475	Yeah, with the Newmark turntables or something like that.
3498696	3499836	Maybe you can get some pictures or something.
3500696	3501797	Yeah, it's only in Dallas.
3501817	3503717	They don't give a crap about that stuff anyway.
3503797	3504778	That's what pisses me off.
3505118	3507178	I'm totally excited to play it.
3509059	3509359	Whatever.
3510039	3512160	Well, let's move on around the world with more releases.
3513021	3514341	Two things for the UK.
3515161	3517222	The 23rd is Savage Moon on PlayStation 3.
3518282	3522744	And on the 26th, Boxing Day is 100 Classic Book Collection.
3524594	3524814	Yeah.
3525734	3527115	It's just not a big week in games.
3527835	3529136	I reckon not.
3529516	3530496	Alright, well, there you have it.
3530536	3533097	We have to do the release dates no matter what, even if it's a slow week.
3533697	3535518	And don't expect next week to be much better.
3536398	3537178	Because it's not.
3538719	3541100	But, you know what is pretty big?
3541540	3543741	The text in Banjo-Kazooie now.
3544081	3552304	Because there's that brand new patch for those people that own the 14-inch standard definition tube TVs.
3553240	3558004	You now can read your text in Banjo-Kazooie and suffer through the dialogue of that game.
3559605	3560386	Hurrah!
3561426	3571895	So, um... Well, thank heavens, because, you know, I was just waiting for the... No, actually, a lot of people really were waiting for something like this to come out, because if you play it on the small TV, this game's next to impossible to play.
3572135	3577299	I'm spoiled with my HDTV, so I need to just stop taunting those that don't have it.
3577319	3578360	Correct?
3578380	3578660	Correct.
3579286	3580347	Yeah, alright.
3580968	3591458	Alright, well, we're just about to the end of Part A tonight, but hey, we've got to take some time to recognize gaming's classics, and that's what we do here in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
3595282	3602829	Oh, DarkSakura, what have you picked for this very special holiday week for the kids and adults out there to recognize this week in gaming?
3603251	3609035	I've picked a bit of NES and Commodore 64 for you, Rob.
3609615	3609956	Yay!
3610336	3612357	Joy, in the form of Maniac Mansion.
3615579	3618201	Maniac Mansion is a weird little game.
3620262	3624145	This music's from the NES version.
3624565	3626206	Yeah.
3627807	3630009	But it was originally on the Commodore 64.
3630049	3630349	So where...
3635757	3643382	It actually is the game that the Scum Engine was created for, the script creation utility for Maniac Mansion.
3644083	3648046	And LucasArts used it for about 10 more years to keep playing it.
3648506	3650788	It also has Chuck LaPlante in it.
3651408	3652630	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3667766	3689069	So basically, there were changes in the people that lived there, and then people that were in the hospital started disappearing, so then there were a bunch of people who decided to go into the house because a local cheerleader turned up missing, and they decided to go through the entire house, which is like this big...
3689750	3697354	B-movie type horror house thing with tentacles and an evil genius and the pool.
3698154	3700295	The pool is the best part.
3700415	3702236	It has multiple endings.
3702796	3703757	You can go through.
3703777	3705538	It depends on who lives, who dies.
3706198	3708159	You can have a perfect ending.
3708239	3710620	You can have the adversary win.
3710780	3716063	You can have them famous by publishing his autobiography.
3716143	3717403	You can feed him to a plant.
3718644	3718724	Um...
3720004	3728449	and you can get your players in the game killed and it has different red herrings in it and
3730819	3733400	Just kind of different weird stuff in the game.
3734580	3739902	The different characters in there is you have the sort of James Dean type character.
3740062	3741983	You have a New Wave musician.
3742783	3744344	You have a photographer.
3744864	3746145	You have a novelist.
3747805	3751386	You have a big nerd who's really scared.
3751446	3751947	Yay, nerd!
3753067	3755508	You've got a punk rock girl.
3756468	3759349	You've got Surfer in there.
3759409	3761150	They all have their different strengths and weaknesses.
3762070	3766792	And I've played this, of course, on the NES, because that's what I had.
3769913	3777776	The different versions there were, there was also a PC that also played...
3780120	3780981	Apple II, Amiga, Atari ST, NES
3795695	3799719	and there is actually an enhanced version with updated graphics that's out.
3800199	3802361	And it had a sitcom based on the series.
3802541	3803663	Do you ever remember watching that?
3803783	3805104	Oh yeah, I remember that!
3805504	3807446	Oh god, that was not very long, but yeah, I remember there was.
3807526	3809107	This game was pretty big when it came out.
3809328	3817015	And there was a fan remake that's called Maniac Mansion Deluxe that runs on Windows that has really...
3818596	3844536	Enhanced Graphics and Music That was actually borrowed from Day of the Tentacle And it's supposed to fix a lot of bugs and inconsistencies And they put in some different changes to make it a little bit harder It's also playable in Day of the Tentacle Maniac Mansion And of course then there was It was really, really censored though on the NES There were a lot of stuff changed Um
3847117	3847457	Awesome.
3847737	3848458	Aww.
3869545	3883512	The guy, though, that ported it, Douglas Crockford, put out a memoir that was called The Expurgation of Maniac Mansion, which was basically him going, God, Nintendo, you suck.
3885238	3907019	about how strict Nintendo was for what they could allow in the game and what they couldn't and about some things that he agreed with taking out like Edna having sexually themed threats to the characters and different things including the use of violence, non-violence and that type of thing.
3910984	3917029	So, it was pretty heavily censored, like I said.
3917910	3923715	Also, like I was saying before, it was my favorite part of the game.
3924455	3932322	Whenever I would just get really tired of playing it and go to hell with this, I would go to the pool, drain it, and push the red button so that the house would explode.
3935103	3936223	It's just what I did every time.
3936243	3938984	I was like, I'm tired of playing!
3939064	3939684	Explode!
3939964	3940364	Game over.
3943444	3947565	I didn't think the graphics on the NES version were that great compared to the computer one.
3947785	3947985	No.
3949726	3956047	Which is strange, because I'm talking about a game on the Commodore 64, but... The Commodore 64 version was actually really nice.
3956707	3959327	I personally did not play it, but I have seen it played.
3960247	3962028	Because, like I said, I didn't have a Commodore 64.
3964131	3965873	I had a click-go-at-em.
3966393	3971698	I have to say, though, as far as this type of game goes on the NES, there is a game I do prefer, these point-and-click games.
3972318	3972859	Shadowgate.
3973599	3974860	Shadowgate was great!
3974980	3978023	You know what part I would always get stuck at?
3978483	3985309	It was where you went into the portal and you had a limited time with your... You had to actually have some item to make it through the portal.
3985369	3986790	You're gonna need to do that in a future week.
3986830	3987651	I'm gonna have to.
3988111	3990313	I actually never finished Shadowgate, but I love Shadowgate.
3991274	3991735	But, um...
3992645	3995870	It's just interesting because you don't think about these point-and-click games a lot on the NES.
3996772	3997854	But there were some really good ones.
3999676	4002717	But, um, yeah, this, it's a really good one.
4002797	4013642	You know, also, uh, some of the, uh, LucasArts, uh, I was just looking at the list of the different LucasArts, uh, um, titles that were supposed to go along with the SCUMM engine.
4014683	4017064	And let me get back to that because I was just on it.
4017084	4019565	It was, um, I think a couple of Monkey Island games.
4021026	4022586	And, uh, Labyrinth and Loom.
4023867	4025928	And I think I've covered Loom before.
4025948	4026028	Okay.
4026553	4029977	Which is strange because I think Loom came out before Maniac Mansion, didn't it?
4030677	4031338	No, it was after.
4031378	4031618	No?
4031658	4032399	No, it was after.
4033120	4033440	Strange.
4034141	4035842	It was after Monkey Island even, I think.
4037824	4043290	But yeah, and actually one of the Sam and Max games was supposed to use it, but they cancelled it.
4045937	4052787	Sam & Max Freelance Police Full Throttle Payback Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
4061520	4062820	Well, there you have it.
4063801	4067522	If there's nothing else to add, then your classic game of the week is... Blow up the house!
4068422	4074443	Maniac Mansion on the NES or Commodore 64, whatever system you prefer.
4074724	4075364	Maniac Mansion.
4075464	4077524	And don't forget to drain the water from the pool and blow up the house!
4078144	4079705	That's DarkSakura's favorite thing to do, correct?
4080980	4081780	Indeed!
4082080	4082401	All right.
4082981	4087562	Well, we're going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio and do some music here.
4088103	4090483	And when we come back, we have plenty more.
4090583	4092984	Actually, sorry, the podcast folks, you won't get to hear the music.
4093044	4093804	That's just the way it is.
4093844	4094985	You know, copyright rules and everything.
4095425	4103688	But we'll be back really soon with more of Orange Lounge Radio, more stories, hopefully a little bit happier than all the layoff stories we had in Part A. Do you think we can arrange that, Loki?
4103748	4105989	Get some happier stuff in Part B tonight?
4106209	4106749	All right, we'll try.
4107729	4110090	Meanwhile, we're going to go ahead and take a break, and we will be right back.
4116218	4123003	And welcome back to more of Orange Lounge Radio and this Part B of our podcast for this December the 21st of 2008.
4123383	4126245	And happy holidays to you guys out there listening to the program.
4127165	4133790	We talked a lot about different things going on in Part A. Unfortunately, a lot of really not-so-happy holidays going on for a lot of folks in the game industry.
4134791	4135471	Bummer to hear that.
4136292	4144257	We talked also about some other news, including some sales stuff about HD Remix and some little Big Planet updates and stuff.
4144457	4145658	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4170279	4170739	Still going to be $10.
4171620	4175402	Apparently they ran into some unexpected technical difficulties.
4177543	4179684	At least they didn't call it Balloon Knot Hole Island.
4179844	4181005	I mean, that would have been really bad.
4183346	4184867	That would be horrible.
4187368	4188008	Why the delay?
4189789	4191550	Unexpected technical difficulties.
4191890	4193131	Whatever that's supposed to mean.
4195110	4196471	Everyone took some time off for the holidays.
4196551	4199572	I still don't think it's a good name to name it Knothole Island anyways.
4199672	4202973	It just makes me think of like a glory hole.
4203013	4205074	Well, haven't you ever heard of what a balloon knot is?
4206154	4207675	That's supposed to be like an asshole.
4208055	4209835	Because you know what a balloon knot looks like?
4210436	4211116	An asshole.
4211276	4211856	Exactly.
4211936	4213297	And this one helps in San Diego.
4215669	4220552	And every time I hear Knothole Island, I keep thinking of a balloon knothole and it's disgusting.
4220572	4224234	I'm like, who wants to visit an island with a bunch of assholes?
4224835	4227196	There is a house in San Diego that looks like a sphincter.
4227876	4230358	Make all the gay jokes you want, but that does not sound appealing.
4230378	4230918	I'm sorry.
4231699	4232819	So, there you have it.
4235841	4236141	Anyway.
4238323	4238763	Anyway.
4240164	4240884	Sorry, I'll move on.
4240984	4243666	I'm trying to eat a bagel while I'm talking and making jokes.
4243946	4244967	I need to stop eating cookies.
4246529	4253528	Tiger Claw says every time I hear Knothole I'm thinking of Sonic AM Moving on
4254800	4260024	800-point Microsoft point cards now have made their way into the retail marketplace.
4261064	4264967	Apparently, you could only get 1,600 Microsoft points before.
4265007	4265707	It was $19.99.
4266268	4270050	But now you can get 800 Microsoft point cards at retailers for $9.99.
4271291	4274333	And, hey, that would be one whole cent cheaper than buying them online.
4274433	4275894	Oh, but you have to pay tax.
4276054	4277555	So you're screwed.
4277615	4278836	Then you have to consider there's tax.
4279016	4283219	It's good if you want to give a gift or if, like, you know...
4284039	4285879	You don't have a credit card and you're a little kid.
4287300	4293161	Or you want to buy it as a gift, but it's a stocking stuffer, so maybe $20 is too much.
4293341	4293681	I don't know.
4294001	4294681	Just buy it online.
4295341	4295821	Yeah, I guess.
4295921	4296741	You know what I want?
4297762	4298262	World Peace?
4298582	4299302	No, not World Peace.
4299322	4299962	Screw World Peace.
4301082	4304763	But they're not available in most stores is those PlayStation Network cards.
4305243	4309624	Because I hate the PlayStation Network and how they do their payments online.
4309864	4310704	Yeah, it's a little silly.
4310744	4311185	I don't like it.
4311245	4319788	By the way, speaking of PlayStation Network, because you brought it up and I forgot to mention earlier in the show, we talked about PlayStation Home last week and I said I was going to get an OLR club as soon as they opened it up.
4320128	4324670	Well, I guess I missed it because I went back online later in the week and I saw where you could buy a clubhouse online.
4324710	4325471	It was just hard to find.
4326171	4331413	I'm not interested in it because you have to invite people into the club and you can only invite up to like 30 people.
4331833	4333034	What kind of an OLR club is that?
4334614	4336135	Not a cool one, unfortunately.
4336175	4336435	I know.
4336475	4338276	We have more than 30 people in our chat room tonight.
4338296	4339857	We probably would have more people now than we do.
4340278	4347362	I thought it was something that people would be able to search and go into at their leisure, but I don't see how it's promotion for the show to do that.
4347922	4348683	It sounds stupid.
4348743	4350744	Then I'd have to buy all the furniture, so forget it!
4352116	4353937	Until home gets cooler, I protest.
4354277	4354518	Sorry.
4354698	4357900	Well, there are probably only about 30 of our listeners that actually have a PlayStation 3.
4357980	4359681	True, true.
4360281	4361282	Look at the sales numbers.
4361562	4365204	SJ100Matt in our chat room wants to point out, I see PSN cards in Best Buy.
4365685	4367706	Red Entertainment says, not only that, clubs cost money.
4367766	4367986	Fail.
4368306	4370868	I was willing to, like, for five bucks, I would have done it.
4370968	4371869	Like, it's an experiment.
4371889	4372529	How much was it?
4372709	4373230	Five bucks.
4373430	4373850	Five bucks?
4373930	4374270	Okay.
4374290	4375411	Is it five bucks per month or year?
4375431	4375931	I'm still considering it.
4377032	4382195	Right now it's $5 with no reoccurring fee, but Sony is going to implement them at some point.
4383276	4383996	I just didn't say when.
4384236	4386157	Like, home doesn't suck enough.
4387378	4389519	Now, do we have the trophy rooms and stuff?
4389880	4390320	Nope.
4390340	4394522	So, like most things, it's extremely early.
4394622	4398525	I'm sure home will be better in a year, but by then we will have all forgotten.
4398545	4400526	Home is extremely late as it is.
4400746	4402427	It's no time for being early.
4402547	4403267	It's late.
4405429	4405909	Just saying.
4406423	4406623	I know.
4406823	4407224	Alright, sorry.
4407244	4410346	We can go back to other stuff now.
4410586	4411007	Sorry, Jamie.
4412248	4412868	Okay.
4413549	4414009	Sega!
4415691	4416131	What about them?
4416731	4427860	Well, it looks like there's been some ESRB ratings put out, so that means that there are going to be a number of games on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network from Sega.
4428481	4434266	There will be Sonic 3, Comic Zone, Phantasy Star 2, and Gunstar Heroes.
4434426	4435106	Woo-hoo!
4436127	4439650	which are supposed to be out.
4439890	4442172	And then there were, I guess, other releases.
4443874	4450099	I'm sorry, the previous releases were Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic 2, Golden Axe, Echo the Dolphin, and Streets of Rage 2.
4451240	4456965	Wait a minute, but isn't Sega putting out that thing of like 40 games for like 20 bucks or something?
4457486	4458307	Yes?
4458527	4461289	Do you think that Sega wants as much money as possible?
4461469	4461970	Yes.
4462250	4462650	Okay.
4463611	4464052	Sega!
4464372	4465933	Are they giving me anything special?
4466994	4467775	More achievements?
4468595	4469096	I guess.
4469176	4474600	And they're gonna give you the option to blur it out so that it looks all, like, you know, HD-like.
4474801	4477303	Just buy the $20 thing when it comes out.
4477383	4478063	Seriously.
4479344	4480545	Unless they're actually remaking everything.
4483356	4484476	Which I highly doubt that they are.
4485156	4485857	We'll see what happens.
4486497	4490158	Something else coming to Xbox Live Arcade, kind of interesting.
4491438	4497679	I'm not sure a lot of people are familiar with the MMORPG DOFUS.
4498039	4502140	They have a game, I think it's called Wakfu.
4502660	4507421	And now the islands of Wakfu are going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
4507461	4509942	So it's like an MMO, but not.
4510342	4511923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4540838	4542019	An adventure beat-em-up?
4542660	4543660	An adventure beat-em-up.
4544121	4547003	It's an adventure slash beat-em-up all-style game.
4547863	4556950	It says it can be played in a two-player team mode and will reveal never-before-seen background content from the world of Dofus and Wakfu.
4558931	4564775	Really, because to me, the entire world of Dofus and Wakfu are unseen and I have not played either one.
4566769	4570051	But hey, it's a different type of game and that's always welcome.
4570171	4574373	Bochikawa in chat asks, Wakfu, is that like beating people senseless with a frying pan?
4576053	4577394	Yes, it is, exactly.
4577654	4579115	Now that would be a great game.
4580043	4580643	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4610051	4611132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4630530	4631310	Thanks for watching!
4648039	4650221	PowerSwitch and stuff, it's really funky.
4650541	4658828	Like the PowerSwitch, there's a little button that's off-center on it, so if you push it in the center of your faceplate, it won't exactly trigger it every time.
4658868	4660149	You kind of have to push to the right of it.
4661451	4665174	So, and the way the eject button works is kind of similar.
4665294	4668316	It's a little push-button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out.
4668797	4676123	But, you know, you can always, if you can't get it to eject that way, just, you know, hit the middle button and select eject disc.
4677694	4681661	Great, Jrod in chat says, I used to have to do that and it ended up where the disk drive wouldn't read anymore.
4682443	4682843	Lovely.
4684583	4688484	Remember, they won't warranty it unless it red rings, so that's when you take a blowtorch to it.
4689624	4691025	Well, look, there's some other options, too.
4691105	4696746	The other options were to slow down the disc rotation speed, but that was rejected because it would have slowed down the game loading times.
4696806	4697906	I think we can understand that one.
4698686	4706887	And then, apparently, the other option was to install little bumpers that would have cost the company between $35 to $75 million additional dollars.
4706987	4710328	But I would think little bumpers, wouldn't that be maybe like a buck?
4711383	4711843	A machine?
4712624	4714786	Yes, it's literally that little.
4716087	4720250	They had a fix a long time ago when people were writing a scratch thing that was available online.
4720270	4730399	You'd buy these little... It looked like a CD, and you would put it in the drive and kind of push it up, and it would stick little pads on there that would keep the disc from jiggling.
4730419	4739426	Because basically what happens is since the disc has so much play inside the drive, it'll end up bending back to where it rubs up against the laser, and that's what carves a nice little...
4740407	4741308	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4751943	4762466	Well, here's the thing is that... And the big thing that the document shows is that Microsoft, what they eventually decided to do, they appended the manual with a warning and offered a disk replacement program.
4762786	4764187	You know, that was their big fix.
4764347	4769488	And I believe something about like a sticker on the door, too, that you have to pull off that warns them not to tilt the machine when you play.
4770708	4774970	Apparently, this was deemed insufficient by company employees via an internal email.
4775670	4777150	But it's apparently what happened anyway.
4777731	4779151	Well, it is kind of... I mean...
4780632	4788056	It's a stupid fix, and really they should have just added those little bumpers to it, because it wouldn't have cost them $75 million.
4788116	4790077	I mean, how many consoles do they have out there?
4790117	4797220	They have like almost 15,000, you know, 15 million consoles, or not even really that many, but like over 10 million consoles, okay?
4797300	4800682	So, you know, they're saying $75 million, so that's $750 per console.
4800722	4801682	Or no, that's $75 million.
4801742	4805264	That'd be $0.75 per console, basically.
4805324	4805384	So...
4812154	4813375	No, my math's all wrong today.
4813695	4813995	Whatever.
4814275	4814735	It doesn't matter.
4814955	4816175	Either way, it's not going to cost that much.
4816636	4819957	Actdeft in chat says, but who the fuck moves around a console when playing a game?
4820037	4820337	Really?
4821837	4828899	Well, some people own pets like my cat who likes to jump on consoles and she may knock it over.
4828959	4837302	Luckily, I'm smart enough to know if the cat's nearby the console, I will lay it flat on the ground instead of tipping up and that's a rare occasion.
4837622	4840523	We just tuck ours away where she can't get to it.
4840888	4842629	Yeah, I mean, someone can bump it.
4842809	4845691	You know, a court get pulled or something and knock the console over.
4846131	4847812	I mean, there's all sorts of stuff that can happen.
4847872	4855958	It's rare, but there are cases, though, I've been hearing where people are just getting a groove carved into it just from leaving it
4856718	4858840	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4885859	4889584	Whatever happened to that controller that was supposedly coming out that had a better D-pad?
4889784	4890965	I never saw that.
4891106	4894049	And why they would do that for a limited amount of time is retarded.
4894610	4895671	That's a very good question.
4895691	4897574	I have no idea why they would do that.
4898214	4899937	And Tigerclaw wants to say...
4901258	4902339	Microsoft needs to fix the tray eject problem.
4902379	4903641	A lot of people are experiencing it.
4903681	4904341	I'm not the only one.
4917515	4921399	and Bobby Blackwolf wanted to work in a cheap plug for his upcoming new show.
4921779	4927645	He said the first episode of Friday Night Gaming will address that issue directly on stage with a company that repairs consoles.
4927685	4931749	Apparently one little shtick they're going to do on their show is actually repair consoles live on air.
4932455	4933356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4955168	4960270	I don't have the device to do it, let alone the patience or the skill necessary.
4983393	4986816	We don't want to do any more news, we're done, we're out of here Have a great night everybody Bye
5007665	5010127	So mailbagorangepontradio.com Let's read some of those emails.
5011688	5013369	Hey OLR, this is Amasa Tsuma.
5013409	5019754	My question to you is if you were able to throw an object at someone, what would that object be and who would you throw it at?
5019834	5020875	Must be non-lethal.
5021896	5024338	Does this have something to do with the bush shoe thing this week?
5024898	5025179	It must.
5025199	5025439	Probably.
5027088	5038776	I actually would, if I could completely get away with it without, you know, the Secret Service trying to jump me or anything, I would throw something at Bush.
5039136	5046720	I would throw basically the waste of a homeless person at him.
5048862	5049082	Feces?
5049122	5049242	Feces.
5050413	5051455	No, over all waste.
5051575	5052035	Oh, okay.
5052476	5052716	Yeah.
5053518	5054719	And say that it was his fault.
5057003	5058104	But that's hypothetical.
5059346	5060548	Not that I would physically do that.
5061089	5065475	So I'm not breaking any sort of constitutional law by saying it would be cool if that were to happen.
5068118	5068558	Can I answer?
5068578	5069019	Can I answer?
5069379	5070039	Go for it.
5070159	5074401	That crazy, messed up, fags-go-to-hell guy.
5074441	5075061	What's that guy?
5075201	5075501	Phelps.
5075541	5076621	Phelps, yes.
5077082	5081043	I would like to throw a cream pie at him, but what a waste of a yummy pie.
5081983	5085025	So I will throw... Throw rainbow sparkles at him.
5085045	5085725	Feces pie!
5087446	5088426	Here's some shit cake.
5091287	5092968	Here, Fred Phelps, have a shit cake.
5095509	5096469	I like that idea.
5097239	5098740	Millions of dollars at my cell.
5102141	5104282	That would mean you'd have to have it to throw it at yourself first.
5104342	5109184	No, I would have to have a million dollars in my hand, which means I would have acquired millions of dollars.
5110204	5111744	Win-win either way, I have to look at it.
5112785	5115266	I like that we've invented a new word on the show tonight, shit cake.
5115946	5116366	I like that.
5116486	5118287	I'm going to use that in a sentence three times this week.
5118979	5120420	Shitcake, shitcake, shitcake.
5120560	5121621	Shut up and go eat shitcake.
5123102	5126305	Also, last week you asked for Christmas e-cards and I decided to make one.
5126685	5131869	Since I suck at Photoshop, I made it using this Microsoft Flash app that uses your 360 avatars.
5131990	5133050	I hope you will enjoy it.
5133191	5133471	Sat.
5134351	5135072	It's cute.
5135292	5137874	It's the Joker avatar in front of a fire.
5137894	5139776	I think I saw that as his signature on another forum.
5139796	5140416	I thought it was funny.
5142258	5143259	Next email.
5143519	5143559	Um...
5147526	5148927	Hello, crew of OLR.
5149047	5151028	It is I, Katakos, a.k.a.
5151088	5157651	Reese, here to tell you and to anyone else who plays Stepmania that I have made a song for download.
5158532	5160253	And I'll just post a link in the chat room.
5161493	5165615	But are you guys slash girl impressed with the 2009 PSP games?
5165796	5169798	Also, has anyone heard anything about Elder Scrolls Travels for PSP?
5170758	5177593	and do you really think there will be not T-H-E-I-R, it should be T-H-E-R-E?
5177613	5179357	He's typing on a PSP.
5180529	5181049	It doesn't matter.
5181109	5181770	Spelling is spelling.
5183431	5185872	And also, E and R are right next to each other.
5185972	5186752	E and I are not.
5187913	5188733	If it uses QWERTY.
5189674	5192395	And do you think that there will be a little big planet for PSP?
5193556	5193816	Hmm.
5194116	5197098	Hope you enjoy this song as much as I enjoy your show.
5197478	5199699	Reese, BC, Canada.
5199839	5200720	My birthday is December 26th.
5200740	5200880	LOL15Woo.
5203963	5204784	PSP, PSP, PSP
5221172	5221432	Really?
5221692	5221972	Yes.
5222572	5224433	Tell me some of the titles I have to look forward to.
5224653	5228594	Star Ocean 2nd, where the second Star Ocean game is coming out.
5229594	5234916	Resistance Reptribution, LocoRoco 2, Poptapon 2.
5236016	5239257	There's supposedly a Motorstorm game and a little Big Planet game coming.
5239277	5243559	I'm trying to think of what else.
5243639	5246879	Monochemia is coming out on PSP.
5247240	5248240	Where's Africa PSP?
5249668	5251090	Where's Africa PS3?
5251150	5253272	That's true, wasn't that supposed to be out by now?
5253512	5271811	Yeah, they were picking up a National Geographic license I was this close to importing it And I was like, fuck that, I can't run over the animals So I said, no, I'm not buying that Uh, Dissida, when it comes out in English Yes, Dissida will be coming out over here in the summer Okay God, I can't wait to play that Um
5274002	5278023	I don't know, it looks like a better year, definitely, because 2008 sucked.
5278203	5281944	And, like, you look at the releases, there was just not a lot of releases, period.
5282184	5283264	I mean, there were some good ones.
5283324	5285904	I mean, the Midnight Club LA remix is supposed to be pretty good.
5285924	5289905	You know, Star Ocean, the first one, was pretty good.
5290625	5295466	I could go for some more of the Final Fantasy ports to the PSP.
5295966	5297887	That would be pretty awesome, like, you know, maybe six.
5300727	5303648	Did we get all the questions in that email?
5303848	5304309	I think we did.
5304709	5305529	Oh, I don't doubt.
5305569	5307010	Sorry.
5307190	5309490	Yeah, we did.
5310471	5313092	Moving on to the next email.
5314913	5321395	I just thought I would update you folks as to what's going on regarding the situation with my stolen PS3.
5321835	5323136	This is from Spazinator.
5323156	5323776	Spazinator.
5324116	5333452	Oh yes, he called in last week or the week before to mention that it got stolen, and he wanted us to kind of put out the word for all our fans in Buffalo, of which I don't know how many we have, but we tried.
5334093	5341437	To date, the Buffalo Police have not done anything about it, and let's face it, unless the PS3 was jelly-filled or covered in sprinkles, they aren't likely to look for it.
5341517	5342757	Frankly, I have no faith in them.
5343718	5347499	My counseling agency has been helpful as a wet fart.
5347720	5348500	Read, not at all.
5349060	5357184	You'd think that since the theft occurred there that they'd be eager to have this issue resolved just to cover their collective asses, but it looks like that isn't the case.
5357864	5357944	As...
5359765	5360706	I lost my place, actually.
5361206	5371629	As a related note, and if I neither mentioned it in the call or you haven't figured it out already, I brought my PS3 to my counseling agency for an informal party.
5372089	5378891	I was supplying the entertainment, movies downloaded on PSN, karaoke, rock band, slash guitar hero, world tour style, etc.
5378991	5379791	It was stolen between 12.15 p.m.
5379811	5379971	and 1.15 p.m.
5379991	5380151	EST.
5380171	5381412	Wouldn't that be a.m. ?
5387617	5391619	on AST on 11.19 when it was unattended.
5392099	5395320	In all likelihood, I won't be getting my original system back, which is a shame.
5395780	5398641	I had the 60GB model, which are impossible to find.
5399001	5405604	Not only that, but I upgraded the internal HDD and bought a ton of stuff off of the PSN store.
5406264	5420434	Anywho, luckily my SSI PAE is sitting on my rainy day fund and sent her a request for the adequate funds to replace the system with a used 80GB model and the same type of upgraded HDD that I had before.
5420775	5424097	I'll worry about the movies and TV shows that I bought at a later time and date.
5424678	5425898	Sorry for the long as hell email.
5426019	5426819	Trust me, it's not.
5427299	5429361	And I figured that you'd appreciate an update.
5429421	5429781	Take care.
5430982	5432003	Well, thanks for letting us know.
5432083	5439450	Well, stolen systems suck, and whoever stole your system needs to die in a fire, and let's just hope that karma comes around and bites this person in their big fat ass.
5442072	5442533	Next email.
5443243	5443724	Next email!
5469420	5473762	I don't know if it's gaming related, but I would like a new computer.
5473822	5478204	I have a new computer for the gaming, but I would just like a whole new setup for the show.
5478584	5486667	I'd like a fancy new mix board, an easier way to publish a show on a faster computer without having to transfer it to my new one, which has kind of been slowing things down.
5486687	5488287	I guess it's technically gaming related.
5488747	5490228	Technically, because it has to do with the show.
5490768	5492169	So that would be my thing.
5492229	5496270	I'd want a fancy, I want a state-of-the-art computer recording studio.
5496790	5497311	That's what I want.
5497831	5498111	Yeah.
5501108	5504010	I want a DDRX machine.
5505030	5506371	That's pretty pricey.
5506631	5506851	Nice.
5507171	5507572	And new.
5509653	5510133	DarkSakura?
5511614	5511974	Really?
5512395	5516217	I can't say that there's too much that I would really want that I don't already have.
5517858	5526603	I actually want a PC Engine Duo RX and an arcade card so that I can play Sapphire.
5528826	5531048	and I want a baby Pac-Man machine.
5531829	5533990	Fuck yes!
5534030	5534731	You know what?
5534751	5535612	The hell with the studio.
5535652	5537073	Just bring me a baby Pac-Man machine.
5537093	5537433	You know what?
5537493	5539275	I already have the pinball machine that I really want.
5539915	5541537	I have my World Cup soccer.
5542297	5545200	Can you believe that Dan actually asked me if I would trade it temporarily?
5546140	5548962	Okay, I can't go on a completely random tangent for a minute.
5549002	5549302	Go for it.
5549403	5550303	Okay, here's the thing.
5551204	5551944	It is related, though.
5553325	5556387	On Twitter, I follow some other podcasters, some other indie podcasters.
5556427	5559229	And one of the podcasters I follow is one of the guys from Video Game Outsiders.
5559829	5561250	And he posted to YouTube today.
5561290	5565373	I guess he picked up some new Popeye machine or something.
5565393	5571857	I guess what he does, he has, like how you amass a bunch of pinball machines in your house, he amasses a bunch of 80s stuff in his basement.
5571918	5573439	A bunch of babies in his basement.
5573499	5574539	Not a bunch of babies.
5576020	5578781	I found this baby at the mall.
5579641	5582322	I'm going to take it home and raise it to do my work.
5582402	5584643	No, stop trying to start a podcast war.
5584663	5585543	I can just see it now.
5585844	5588364	I can see they're going to read an email on the show.
5588604	5591846	The guys from OLR said that you have babies in your basement.
5593426	5594687	What do you have to say about that?
5594987	5595687	They're crunchy.
5598123	5598944	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5613760	5622724	and I have to admit, it's the first time I've ever really watched something like that another podcaster did where I was completely overcome with jealousy.
5623365	5624725	Like just total jealousy.
5624765	5627447	I was looking at it going, that is so cool.
5627507	5629007	I am so fucking jealous.
5629147	5631248	I want one of those fuckers so badly.
5631469	5633630	Even the baby Pac-Man sort of sucks ass.
5634690	5635731	It's the novelty.
5636071	5637231	It's the novelty of the whole thing.
5637251	5641994	The only successful incarnation of video and pinball has been Pinball 2000.
5644045	5644325	Really?
5645125	5646406	So, there you go.
5647146	5649086	God, now they're going to get... I can just see it now.
5649346	5650806	You said you keep babies in your basement.
5650846	5656008	No, it's Baby Pac-Man that he had in his basement that I was completely and utterly overcome with jealousy.
5656428	5657248	He had babies.
5658148	5661129	If I could find one of those machines cheap, you know I would put that shit in this garage.
5661149	5662229	You wouldn't find one cheap.
5662649	5662889	I know.
5662909	5664669	Unless it's completely destroyed and gutted.
5664889	5665210	I know.
5665490	5666350	Last email.
5666410	5669050	Dan, come fix my Baby Pac-Man.
5669430	5671651	Because I don't know dick about pinball games.
5672972	5673432	Hey, OLR!
5699224	5701005	Without much lag while I was there.
5701585	5704747	Well, I got home and started playing for a few hours, so my question is for Sky.
5705207	5709169	What server, or whatever it is it's called, do you play on?
5709289	5712450	I play on the Garethos, did I spell that right?
5712931	5713371	Server.
5713791	5718193	I'm level 9, and I wanted to know if it's worth buying and if I can switch server to play on with you.
5718733	5722235	Also, tell me a little about the game and some of the things that will convince me to buy it.
5724102	5725863	I'm going to give you an answer you weren't expecting.
5725903	5730764	Because if I remember right, Cheeseburger is like 15 years old, 14, 15, like he's a younger listener of ours.
5731124	5735146	My advice to you is not to buy World of Warcraft because you're still in school.
5735566	5738967	And if you get sucked into a game like World of Warcraft, it could affect your school.
5739427	5739947	Here's the thing.
5740048	5748070	If you know in your heart and in your gut and in your mind that you can restrict yourself to playing this game one or two hours a day tops, then it might be okay.
5748390	5749831	But honestly, it's the social element.
5750171	5751652	That's what really these games are all about.
5751952	5756155	I could describe all about the quests and the classes and the magic and all this stuff, but you know what?
5756195	5756955	You're playing the game.
5756995	5758096	You see all that firsthand.
5758496	5763319	The reason why people get addicted to this stuff is the social element.
5763599	5767222	When I log on to the game and I say hello to the guild, everybody goes, Rob!
5767622	5770864	It's like walking into Cheers, the bar, and everybody yells, Norm!
5771504	5772365	It's that kind of thing.
5772505	5775547	That's the reward that you're going to get out of a game like Warcraft.
5776327	5776928	That being said...
5777808	5778689	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5797057	5797858	That's my honest advice.
5797878	5797978	Ta-da!
5797998	5799539	So that was it for emails?
5825367	5826728	I said that, didn't I?
5827088	5827968	Well, I wasn't listening.
5828249	5828609	Surprise.
5828629	5829729	Well, gee, Rob.
5829769	5830350	What else is new?
5830390	5831570	I don't listen to this show.
5831590	5833311	I just talk on it.
5833652	5834012	All right.
5834112	5834832	That's it for emails.
5834872	5837994	If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
5838034	5841296	We'll get some more stuff from you later during the Skype line.
5842695	5845456	I don't know how long we can go tonight because it's fucking freezing out here in the garage.
5845516	5847277	But we will get some more stories first.
5847297	5848637	It's not as cold as it was last week.
5848777	5849958	It's still pretty fucking cold.
5851018	5851819	I love this quilt.
5852419	5852979	It's so cold.
5853119	5853819	Alright, Loki.
5854940	5859922	There's rumors that the PSP is getting another revision.
5860462	5864143	The PSP 4000 is apparently due out late 2009.
5864763	5868525	This is coming to us from Eurogamer that reports their publishing sources.
5869065	5870206	Sony is planning to launch a PSP2
5895000	5897702	Where have I heard we have no plans for something before?
5897862	5898402	Oh, I know!
5898603	5901304	On every other rumor that they have no plans on.
5901325	5902966	Like, no plans for a price cut.
5903026	5905608	No plans on releasing a 160GB system.
5906088	5909010	No plans for doing something that's completely obvious.
5909050	5910711	No plans to release a good system.
5912232	5915214	We have no plans on ever becoming the number one console.
5916495	5916775	Again.
5917956	5919718	So, when you hear no plans...
5920675	5922698	Hear them saying, it's like we are.
5924100	5927324	So, yeah, just big deal.
5927765	5929447	We know hardware revision's coming.
5930008	5930649	Not a big surprise.
5931850	5934914	A sequel to a popular handheld system might happen, you think?
5935615	5936076	Hello?
5936136	5937798	Yeah, that's what I thought.
5938669	5946074	Hey, moving on over to Nintendo, who has been number one lately, although amongst the hardcore gamers, some of us are starting to feel a little jaded.
5946615	5951858	I don't know, this is something that some hardcore gamers will be into, but probably more for the casual crowd and the young folks.
5952839	5959604	Some of the early 2009 releases for Nintendo, of course, headlined by Pokemon Platinum on March 22nd.
5960204	5965528	That is going to be a pretty big title on the Nintendo DS, even though, isn't it just the last two Pokemon?
5965768	5966749	They do this all the time.
5966789	5966869	They
5966869	5967209	DarkSakura.com
5982943	5984104	Some other games that are coming out.
5984524	5989967	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echo of Time is supposed to actually come out this spring, so we'll see what happens with that.
5991348	5993129	Let's see, what else is supposed to come out here?
5993149	5994150	I've got a whole list.
5996891	5999052	That is spring that they said that game would come out.
5999453	5999953	March?
6000553	6002174	Yeah, probably the later the better.
6003735	6004856	For them, not for me.
6004876	6008438	Dragon Quest V. Is that on...
6009673	6014300	Saga's Putting Out the House of the Dead Overkill on Wii in February Sonic and the Black Knight in March Mad World in March
6027408	6031572	Ubisoft's got Tenchu in February and Broken Sword, Shadows of the Templars in March.
6032092	6038097	Nintendo, first party games, the only stuff they're putting out, Mario Power Tennis in March and Pikmin in March.
6038198	6038618	That's it.
6039058	6039659	On the Wii, yeah.
6039819	6040219	On the Wii.
6041400	6052470	However, on the DS from Nintendo, Personal Trainer Math on January 12th, Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon on February 16th, and the before-mentioned Pokemon Platinum, which is kind of in line with their one title a month.
6052830	6053550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6071669	6080415	Ubisoft, Imagine Cheerleader, Imagine Family Doctor, Imagine Ice Champions, American Popstar, Road to Celebrity Cash Cow Pikmin
6096158	6099741	I do want to point out, Konami is putting out a game on the Wii that some of you guys might care about.
6099761	6101262	DDR Disney Grooves.
6102163	6104185	For those that are still playing DDR after all these years.
6104245	6104605	There you go.
6107247	6111491	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Factor 5 goes down, but Sonic Team is still around.
6111571	6112472	Where's the justice?
6113072	6113853	Where's the justice?
6116675	6119037	That's that for first quarter lineup.
6119498	6119658	Mm-hmm.
6120313	6125999	Well, how about something very cool for all of our 8-bit fans?
6126560	6129683	Which, by the way, thank you for the old-school Nintendo Entertainment System, DarkSakura.
6129723	6132066	It's kind of like a second Christmas gift slash late birthday gift.
6132746	6139914	Well, also, thanks, Sauce, for agreeing to a trade that I got the better end of the deal of.
6140353	6143456	I'm looking at a video here on this site.
6143576	6145257	Sorry, that's what you're hearing in the background. ...
6174539	6181424	I don't know, it seems like it's a hacked ROM of some sort, because the music in the background is strange.
6181464	6182064	Right?
6182144	6183986	It doesn't sound like Pac-Man at all.
6184066	6185026	Anyway, there you go.
6185106	6186047	That's what it sounds like.
6186407	6189269	It might be trying to emulate the music from... Hmm, maybe.
6189589	6197454	Well, at any rate, there's no idea where you can find the ROM.
6197635	6199336	It's from the Pac-Mania soundtrack.
6199896	6200256	Oh, is it?
6200316	6200917	Okay.
6200937	6200977	Oh.
6201744	6202865	Sorry if that was loud, guys.
6202905	6209890	It wasn't loud to us in the studio, but I guess it came out very loud over the... But hey, whoever finds it, then let me know what you think of it.
6210150	6210911	So, cool.
6211752	6218857	Yeah, apparently the weird thing about this is that it's still unknown if this is like real or a concept thing, because no ROM has showed up out there.
6220678	6221079	Who knows?
6221839	6222760	That's the weird thing about it.
6223381	6230026	It's not something you can actually download for use in an emulator, but they say it's an actual 8-bit Nintendo game.
6230757	6231177	I don't know.
6233198	6239939	A game that is coming out on the DS, Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, has been dated for March.
6239959	6245580	Which is weird because I thought it was dated before for January, but either way, it's coming out now March 17th.
6246060	6251481	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars will feature most of Liberty City.
6252401	6256802	I think they're cutting out Alderney from Grand Theft Auto 4, but most of it.
6256942	6258823	And it's going to kind of look a little bit like...
6260183	6261905	The old Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 games.
6261925	6265247	You know, kind of a top-down 3D type of game.
6265728	6266769	And it's all cel-shaded.
6267429	6270192	But still violent and pretty cool looking.
6271873	6273034	Yay cool looking things.
6273775	6276297	Europe will be getting the game three days later on March 20th.
6277057	6279219	Well, that's good that it's not getting delayed so bad.
6279539	6279720	Yeah.
6280640	6282722	And I can't wait to try the online multiplayer.
6282762	6283222	That'd be fun.
6284203	6286425	Of course, tons of people will be cheating in it because they can.
6287066	6287346	I'm sure.
6289423	6292264	Okay, so here's something interesting going on.
6292604	6295806	I don't know what the hell you want to call this, but I don't know if you've heard about this project.
6295846	6302488	It's called Bob's Game, and it's this guy who's spent a lot, a lot of time making a particular DS homebrew project.
6302908	6304549	He's apparently going on protest.
6304589	6312072	He's going to be spending 100 days locked in his room, locked and barricaded from the outside to protest how Nintendo has been treating his project.
6313697	6314277	Here's the thing.
6314598	6322483	He needs a DS software development kit to get his game, which is... I guess what Bob made is some type of 2D adventure thing.
6322543	6323364	It looks really cool.
6323444	6326886	He actually wants to sell it as a retail game, but Nintendo will not give him one.
6326946	6337013	Even though Bob has apparently talked to Nintendo, done the application, told he was going to get an answer in a few months, and apparently 17 weeks have gone by, no answer, no kit has showed up.
6337293	6341636	However, now what he's going to be planning is this 100-day sit-down protest.
6341916	6342797	So he's doing a tantrum.
6343342	6344798	Basically, he's throwing a fit.
6345422	6346363	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6375304	6378226	On the application, it said it would be six to eight weeks for a decision.
6378266	6379206	It's been 17.
6379566	6381087	He says he's met all the requirements.
6381127	6388170	He's a financially stable registered company with an FEIN, which I believe is a federal identification number, working from a commercial address.
6389270	6393612	And he says that when Nintendo decides to approve the developer license, he will end his protest.
6393652	6395913	Apparently, you can actually watch on live webcam.
6396233	6397514	I'm actually going to go to the site right now.
6397534	6399055	It looks like he's asleep.
6399515	6401036	But you can see something on the board right now.
6401056	6402716	It says Reggie on the monitor there.
6403357	6403477	And...
6406063	6409589	It's actually his live confinement right now, but it looks like he's fast asleep or something.
6409909	6410691	Or he left the room.
6411172	6411753	But he's on day 12.
6411813	6415118	How can he leave the room if he's not supposed to leave the room?
6415279	6417342	It says he sleeps behind the camera.
6418043	6418124	Oh.
6419656	6420396	Where's his potty?
6421337	6423238	I hope that's all behind the camera too or something.
6423658	6426019	But anyway, he says he cannot leave the room.
6426079	6428040	The door is locked and barricaded from the outside.
6428440	6429741	He's sleeping behind the camera.
6429821	6430761	Yes, there is a shower.
6431142	6433163	Food is being delivered once a week by a friend.
6433203	6437545	There is no internet access, television, or game consoles besides the ones he's developing on.
6438665	6442927	He can receive and send email on his cell phone so he can get Nintendo's reply and update the site.
6443408	6445709	And the LED counter will be incremented once a day.
6446069	6448230	Sometimes it will display hints and secret messages.
6451232	6453033	So yes, Jamie, he's throwing a tantrum.
6455434	6469760	He's doing the equivalent of sticking his fingers in his ears and closing his eyes and going, Well, still though, what about the point that he's meeting all of Nintendo's requirements and Nintendo's dicking him?
6470832	6471453	What about that?
6472033	6473134	To play Devil's Advocate.
6473154	6474775	We need more Imagine games.
6474975	6477036	We don't have time with this good adventure crap.
6477337	6479038	Need more Imagine and more pets.
6479138	6482480	If it's got Imagine and pets in it, we can definitely do something with it.
6482840	6483841	Oh, and if it's a sim.
6484902	6485782	More sim games.
6486303	6488945	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, you need to get an interview with this guy.
6489005	6489785	I don't know if I can.
6490005	6491066	He has no phone, right?
6491786	6492047	I can't.
6492107	6493087	Oh, no, he has a cell phone.
6493788	6494348	Maybe I can.
6494368	6495609	I guess I could try sending an email.
6495629	6496189	I don't know.
6497410	6499692	Misty in chat says, there's better ways to bitch about it.
6501738	6503960	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6530151	6530552	Amazing.
6531232	6534056	Alright, so good luck, Bob, on your protest, I guess.
6534496	6535017	Don't die.
6537200	6537680	Jeez.
6538501	6541125	Just kind of fucking ridiculous.
6542186	6543728	And by kind of, I mean really.
6545942	6550543	Well, this is very, very happy, happy news for me.
6551163	6556805	Because I have been wanting this game, and I played the other two, and it's freaking beautiful.
6557365	6561326	But Klonoa Door to Phantom Isle is going to be coming out in North America.
6562106	6563847	And that makes me giddy!
6564307	6566308	And it's supposed to be out in Spring 2009.
6568976	6570638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6592157	6595539	and the classic controller is also, you can use that too.
6596259	6601983	And there is a rumor that the Klonoa 2 remake is on its way.
6603904	6610508	Klonoa 2 is freaking hard, but I really, really, really, really, really love Klonoa.
6611168	6613209	Maybe this took so long to come out in the U.S.
6613289	6617812	because the Klonoa developers locked themselves in a room for 100 days until Nintendo agreed to put out their game.
6621636	6622176	Just saying.
6624918	6639509	Well, after much begging and pleading, apparently EA has decided to graciously allow players to be able to reinstall their copies of Spore
6640049	6640189	Hurray!
6660424	6679456	But unfortunately there's not a tool that's gotten me back interested in Spore again To which actually my cat knocked a disc on the floor in its case And I was like, eh, it's a good place for it Nice So do you let the cat rearrange all your furniture?
6680036	6689742	She does that on her own She decides that she wants to cram herself in the tiny space that is between my monitor on the shelf And the top of my desk It's like...
6691265	6692287	Thanks for watching!
6701172	6701933	What's your cat's name again?
6702253	6702774	Stella.
6703174	6703575	Stella.
6703835	6704215	That's right.
6705377	6708240	Hey, the RIAA.
6708300	6717109	Apparently some kitties, some cute kittens went into the RIAA office and just they made them go aww and shucks because they decided to do something nice this holiday season.
6717550	6722936	They are no longer going to sue individual file sharers or harass universities anymore.
6723196	6723256	Woo!
6723716	6724397	and DarkSakura.com.
6744076	6748959	but they'll be able to better control the congestion on their networks by applying this new little policy.
6749960	6753041	Some words from Ars Technica on the original report of this.
6753622	6755723	Suddenly ISPs gained a tremendous new tool.
6755863	6762827	One study in the UK showed that most people sharing music would stop when made aware that their activity was being tracked and that they were not in fact anonymous.
6763227	6767570	Should that hold true in the US, ISPs would presumably see massive decreases in P2P traffic.
6767850	6768190	And whatever.
6768230	6770231	It's not going to work very well, but hey, you know, whatever.
6793568	6794648	Pirate away, everybody!
6794908	6796089	No, just kidding.
6796409	6799649	You shouldn't pirate, because that's why all these people got laid off this week.
6800889	6801750	It was all your fault.
6802030	6804890	Yeah, it's the RAAs coming after you for music.
6805750	6809191	I wonder if there's any companies that are going to say, nope, we're not participating.
6809391	6809971	Go fuck yourself.
6810171	6812632	Yes, stop downloading music and start downloading movies.
6813852	6817353	Jrod in chat says, I got a letter from my ISP about downloading HBO shows.
6817393	6818313	It didn't stop my torrenting.
6821553	6825554	Well, I've never received any kind of cease and desist.
6825774	6829056	The only letters I receive from my ICP is, we're raising your rates.
6830156	6831116	It's like, thanks.
6831856	6834977	You know, if you're downloading TV shows, I mean, they were on TV.
6836038	6836478	I don't get it.
6838539	6842402	Well, some other very interesting news.
6842422	6847505	Let's move away a little bit from the RIAA bastards.
6849466	6852448	EA and Steam have decided to make sweet love.
6854642	6877431	So there's going to be EA games that are available through Steam's service which is Mass Effect Need for Speed Undercover and Spore and the Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack FIFA Manager 09 and Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning So that's going to be hanging out there So they're getting steamy?
6878407	6879908	They're getting steamy.
6880388	6885731	Also others slated for there is Mirror's Edge, Command & Conquer, Red Alert 3, and Dead Space.
6888592	6893035	But not Mick's steamy or else the RIA might sue them for sharing ABC shows.
6894495	6894736	What?
6895116	6895836	Nothing, never mind.
6898237	6899718	If you didn't get that joke, good for you.
6900619	6902239	Who in this room doesn't watch TV?
6902360	6902880	Oh, that's me.
6904275	6905796	Even you watch some TV.
6905836	6908398	You just don't watch TV like on TV.
6908939	6910780	I watch DVDs after the fact.
6911001	6911461	There you go.
6911561	6915324	I will going to be watching a show as soon as it's got new episodes on.
6915985	6916505	When it airs.
6917005	6917266	See.
6917766	6918226	Which is Supernatural.
6918246	6918947	American Idol.
6919207	6919788	Supernatural.
6921409	6923731	What if there's David Cook 2 on American Idol next year?
6924251	6924892	Will you watch that?
6927294	6931077	And keep in mind, I watched American Idol through YouTube.
6932435	6939983	Well this year they're actually getting rid of or they're limiting the amount of the bad singers that they have on the show.
6940804	6942406	To that I say, great!
6943006	6944368	Another show I don't have to watch anymore.
6946378	6955423	Um, so apparently, you know, Crackdown 2 is a game that I wish would come out because Crackdown 1 was awesome and it does need a sequel.
6956023	6963387	But, of course, you know, Real Time Worlds, they're busy working on the game that I'm going to have to get back into MMOs for and that would be APB.
6964607	6968049	But until that happens, people still wish for Crackdown 2.
6968769	6973812	Well, there was a rumor that Crackdown 2 was actually being developed by another company, Ruffian Games.
6974792	6977354	However, that may not be the case anymore.
6979555	6992102	The studio head, Colin McDonald, actually said they would like to make the sequel for Crackdown, although to date they have not been offered from Microsoft for a Crackdown sequel.
6992642	7001307	They are having ongoing discussions with them, and they would feel really hurt if Microsoft went to some other studio to develop it.
7003614	7005835	Wasn't there rumors that that's exactly what Microsoft did?
7006916	7009898	Yeah, there was, but they don't know.
7010239	7020266	They said that they would doubt that Microsoft would choose a startup on RTW's doorstep, Ruffian.
7021167	7023228	I don't know why they would choose them, I guess.
7024189	7025690	Jrod in chat says, Crackdown!
7025790	7027512	Oh, you meant that bonus disc that came with the Halo 3 beta?
7030120	7031602	Yes, that's the one.
7032123	7033424	The game is awesome, okay?
7033585	7034125	Seriously.
7035707	7037229	Way better than the Halo 3 beta.
7037790	7038311	It wasn't bad.
7038511	7040373	It wasn't bad.
7040694	7044538	Actually, in reality, I probably did play more Crackdown than I did Halo 3, and I didn't even know the game.
7044559	7045540	Crackdown was awesome.
7045980	7046541	It was crack.
7047322	7047562	Down.
7047903	7048043	Down.
7049799	7050659	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7073630	7081373	And what it does, it makes all the sights and the sounds of a winter fireplace via your Xbox 360 on the television.
7081933	7088375	It's like one of those, like you remember the old cassette tapes that was just nothing but the fire that you could play in the background during Christmas?
7088855	7090276	That's basically what this is.
7090676	7090856	Huh?
7091416	7092317	Don't you mean a videotape?
7092537	7092777	Yeah.
7093237	7094317	But what did they call it?
7094357	7096458	Like a virtual Yule log or something like that?
7096878	7097839	Virtual fireplace.
7098079	7098859	I don't know what they call it.
7099261	7103343	They still have those and they actually have Blu-rays now of virtual fireplaces.
7104124	7105404	People buy this shit.
7105444	7106445	That's the amazing thing.
7107345	7112248	We should make the official OLR Yule log and just make tons and tons of money off people's...
7113777	7114558	Impulse Buys.
7114618	7114978	I don't know.
7115098	7115639	Kind of crazy.
7117080	7122384	Apparently you can get the demo on your Xbox 360 and you can even get that on the internet.
7122404	7124745	Just download it right away and you can get a little four minute demo.
7124986	7126107	But here's the thing.
7126447	7129169	If you want the full version, it's 400 points.
7130970	7131851	Now, I'm
7132543	7145528	I'm not going to give this guy a lot of shit because having talked to Aaron on a previous show who made Snake360 and talking to the community developers, I think there's a certain range of points that they can charge.
7145688	7149129	And so probably 400 is all this guy can charge.
7149289	7150929	I don't know if he can charge less.
7151670	7153290	No?
7153550	7153290	200.
7153610	7154191	Bastard.
7155751	7156031	Let's see.
7156071	7156331	Hold on.
7156351	7158252	I want to look at some video of this thing in action here.
7158332	7158612	Let's see.
7158652	7160773	I'm going to actually play a little video.
7163723	7167185	Yep, that is definitely a virtual log.
7167925	7171527	To be honest, you could probably purchase a DVD for cheaper.
7173748	7174488	Than five bucks?
7174989	7177350	Yeah, you could probably go to the 99 cent store and get one of these DVDs.
7177730	7182072	The 99 cent store has some pretty funny movies there.
7182532	7186874	In fact, that would be really fun to make stocking stuffers with the 99 cent clearance center movies.
7187215	7187515	Awesome.
7188496	7189997	There's some absolute crap.
7190037	7190658	It's awesome.
7192199	7193660	You don't even press a button.
7193680	7199906	It would be awesome if you pressed a button and you could throw a kitten in the fire and watch what happens.
7200246	7200907	I'm just kidding.
7200927	7202628	No, it is wrong, but funny.
7202928	7203609	A reindeer.
7203689	7204690	That's more festive.
7205430	7205931	Or Santa.
7205971	7208253	You just watch Santa drop in the chimney into the fire.
7209113	7211896	See, that would be worth 400 points.
7212016	7213297	Or Christmas lemmings.
7214418	7216760	As DarkTetsuyinChat says, or a ferret.
7218660	7220561	There's been some new patches for some PC games.
7220581	7222341	Far Cry 2 got a patch to fix their widescreen issues.
7222361	7224422	Apparently it had the same thing that was wrong with Bioshock.
7247608	7248388	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7277484	7280267	Sony declares death to the clamshell Slow going
7295131	7296692	Well, it is Christmas week, for heaven's sake.
7296732	7298354	But hey, or well, you know, coming up.
7298774	7304458	But I am so excited about the clamshell news, because I think that packaging is horrible, evil stuff.
7305339	7306820	Oh, oh, grr.
7307881	7309322	Clamshell packaging can go die in a fire.
7309362	7310443	I'm really excited to hear.
7310463	7316028	I want to press a button and watch all my old clamshell packaging get burned in the fire, because that annoys me.
7316834	7317714	All right, we're taking your calls.
7317734	7322855	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7323415	7324756	I've been doing this a little bit too long.
7325476	7327236	Can you believe next week is our last show of 2008?
7327656	7333717	And then we will go into the year 2009, which would be our seventh year of podcasting, if you can believe it.
7334758	7336138	Or seventh year of doing this show.
7336178	7338298	I guess podcasting hasn't been around seven years, but you know what I mean.
7339199	7339919	Crazy stuff.
7340559	7341139	We're getting old.
7343366	7345767	Next year, one of us will kill another live on air.
7346027	7347448	Just wait for it.
7347488	7348068	Stay tuned.
7349748	7355510	Would you spend $5 for a Yule Log game on the 360 where you could throw clamshell packages into the fire?
7356091	7356551	I might.
7357331	7359212	I just might be willing to spend that kind of money.
7359232	7362193	Except you wouldn't because you'd have to use the D-pad to do that.
7362653	7365814	Alright, I'm going to the chat.
7365834	7366594	Sorry, the phone.
7367294	7369815	That's getting late and I haven't even cracked open the eggnog yet.
7370135	7371156	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
7371176	7371516	Who's this?
7372418	7375800	Legend of Zaku Hey Legend of Zaku, what's up?
7376941	7379103	Nothing much, you know today's my birthday, right?
7379303	7384786	Or for the next, um, less than 40 minutes Well, happy Hanukkah!
7385587	7401438	And birthday Not Jewish That's alright You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate Hanukkah I get guilt I love those potato latkes though Hell yeah, one of my friends was supposed to make me some of those, that sounds delish
7403335	7404156	What's on your mind, Zaku?
7423042	7436148	Nothing but just trying to scurry up as much money as possible to get me something, at least one game for Christmas since the last game I bought was GTA 4 back in May, like April or May.
7436608	7437349	It's been a while.
7437369	7439630	I mean, I'm unemployed right now.
7439650	7447413	I'm trying to find work and I can't be pissing my money away on unnecessary things like that when the bills have to be paid first and foremost.
7447693	7449694	I heard that Prince of Persia dropped in price to $40.
7449754	7450054	Where at?
7452395	7452815	Everywhere?
7454296	7455776	What, for the PC or 360?
7455937	7458438	No, for PS3 and Xbox 360.
7459638	7462139	See, I'm trying to give my PC some love.
7462719	7465781	I was going to ask, what one game are you thinking of buying?
7465821	7467081	Because you must have something in mind.
7467661	7468162	Left 4 Dead.
7468902	7469602	Ah, Left 4 Dead.
7469662	7470803	Why Left 4 Dead?
7471683	7480927	Well, because that's just like playing Half-Life with zombies, but with at least a subpar storyline with it.
7482150	7510935	and I get to use my keyboard and mouse nice very cool I've heard a lot of good things about Left 4 Dead but I think that's another one of those games that I won't probably actually get to check out until next year just because I'm playing so much other crap like WoW yeah well I'm sorry to hear about the financial tough times but you know I mean I have plenty of money saved up I'm not worried about you know the bills but you know I can't burn that money that quickly that money has to last me until I find work right no that's understandable
7512367	7515549	Yeah, I mean, other companies are struggling.
7515609	7520414	I mean, you already had about two or three companies going under in one week.
7520874	7521214	Six.
7521955	7523717	Well, not necessarily going under, but doing layoffs.
7523777	7526579	Six companies doing some type of closure or cutbacks this week.
7527220	7528341	I know Factor 5, and I think
7529943	7542761	Free Radical went belly up Yeah, we reported on it, I don't know if you were here at the very beginning of the show, but we kicked off the show Factor 5, EA, Midway, Free Radical, Asper, and Turbine all did some type of closure or layoff this week
7543680	7545921	Looks like someone's not having a Christmas party this year.
7546081	7547241	No, and it sucks.
7548062	7549102	It's really too bad.
7549262	7549922	It's really too bad.
7549962	7553443	Well, you used to work in, like, cell phone games and stuff.
7553503	7554244	Yes, I do.
7554844	7565468	And this time last year, I had a really nice Christmas party complete with, like, all-you-can-eat stuff, open bar, you know, Guitar Hero, SingStar right there on a nice big projection.
7566928	7568349	Are you surprised by what's happened?
7569129	7570930	I mean, it's shitty all around.
7570970	7571910	It's like, you know...
7572742	7573462	Ask anybody.
7573522	7581224	I bet you know at least three or four or five people that you know personally that are probably unemployed right now and are struggling to find work in this economy.
7582864	7585925	I mean, I have so many skills right now.
7586865	7594767	My experience is that I'm trying my best to secure work, but it's a clusterfuck because I'm not the only one fighting for that same job.
7594787	7600528	It's like hundreds upon thousands of other people fighting for that same position, especially here in New York.
7601184	7602826	It is very, very tough out there right now.
7603447	7604187	It is very tough.
7605489	7616981	You're lucky you still have work, whereas I had to work as a contractor since early this year, since I got laid off from my full-time job.
7617021	7620745	I was connected and I had resources, but they ran out over the summer.
7621611	7623652	Oh no, I'm thankful to have a job.
7623932	7629775	I stopped bitching about the promotion I was supposed to get because a while ago they were trying to give me a promotion at work.
7630195	7635577	And I stopped bitching about it for now because I realized that I should just be lucky to have a job right now, so I'm just going to shut up.
7636318	7641700	It's better to have a job, better to be working than not be working at all like me right now.
7643281	7646602	Well, Zaku, best of luck in your search, maybe for your birthday.
7647063	7647983	Somebody will give you a new job.
7648550	7652491	Well, hopefully if you want, you know, I could give you my resume, see what you could do with it.
7652751	7660652	But then again, I live out, you know, here in New York, so it wouldn't make any sense if I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off, I'm sending it off.
7660732	7663893	Okay, which unfortunately I don't think I have the money to do right now.
7663913	7665593	What the crap happened there?
7665694	7668314	That was, we got like bad echo and Skype.
7668454	7669274	That was awesome.
7669334	7670254	I think closed on me.
7671675	7672475	That was weird.
7673749	7676852	Okay, wow, I swear we didn't do anything.
7676912	7678634	What the crap was that?
7679535	7681476	Skype just crashed on us in studio.
7681516	7684359	We got the error message and that happened.
7684399	7685160	What the fuck?
7685200	7686121	He's a robot.
7686561	7690405	Okay, first, no, dude, this is like the beginning of a scary movie right here.
7690465	7692367	First we had the door blew open.
7692847	7696130	Then we have something happen with Zaku on the Skype line there.
7696731	7697732	What the shit?
7699130	7700571	I'm scared to take another call.
7700591	7701291	Let's see what happened.
7701571	7703072	I don't think it was anything you did, Zaku.
7703092	7703673	Sorry about that.
7704493	7705534	But I didn't do anything either.
7705554	7706234	That's the weird thing.
7707195	7708055	This is crazy.
7710857	7711157	Alright.
7711757	7712778	Let's take one more call.
7714178	7714419	Sorry.
7715679	7717060	I saw something come up and I got excited.
7717080	7717981	Are you going to sleep, Jamie?
7718681	7719321	Good night, Jamie.
7720142	7721062	DarkSakura's going to sleep.
7722563	7723524	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7723544	7723824	Who's this?
7726417	7727238	This is Dark Knight.
7727258	7729061	Y'all must have had a one missed call moment.
7729602	7730083	Hi, Dark Knight.
7730123	7730984	What's on your mind, buddy?
7731705	7734570	Y'all must have had a one missed call moment or something when that happened.
7735970	7736790	It's very weird.
7736850	7738891	I don't know what the hell's going on with Skype, but we'll see.
7738931	7741951	Maybe I need to upgrade, but I thought I just upgraded last week, but whatever.
7742251	7743952	What's on your mind, buddy?
7744032	7760155	Talking about the layouts and whatnot, Free Radical, I can understand them shutting their doors and whatnot, because like I said, they had one buzz game and whatnot that didn't really make much money for them at all and whatnot.
7760748	7766734	Well, yeah, I mean, you know, it's still unfortunate they won't get a chance to do a second one, you know what I mean?
7766774	7767194	That's true.
7768315	7771018	That's true, and they said they were working on the TimeSplitter game, right?
7771138	7771398	Mm-hmm.
7772239	7774141	Yeah, so, I mean, I can understand that.
7774361	7775282	I mean, I understand that.
7775322	7782049	As far as midwaying them, doing layouts and whatnot, that one's kind of hard to swallow because, I mean...
7783837	7787780	The latest Mortal Kombat and whatnot, they've been making their money off of that.
7788240	7791323	I did say the Mortal Kombat team was left intact.
7792083	7793705	Mortal Kombat team was left intact, okay.
7793885	7796527	Yeah, and Midway's kind of had a rough year outside of Mortal Kombat.
7796687	7802812	You know, we don't really know how the other games have been selling yet, but some of their other high-profile titles did not follow through the way they should.
7802852	7808756	And to be honest, I can't think of a lot of Midway games I've gotten really excited about this year, which is kind of a bummer.
7809357	7809837	But, you know.
7810558	7815762	Yeah, I thought I would hear people talk about Blitz, but I don't even think I heard people talking about Blitz and everything like that.
7816122	7816642	Nope, nope.
7816762	7820365	But then EA, I mean, EA's kind of, you know, their year hasn't been that terrible yet.
7820385	7834275	They did a lot of layoffs too, so it's kind of... And that is a big shocker to hear that EA, I figured, I made a comment earlier saying that if one of the big game manufacturing companies did have any layoffs, then we'd really be scratching our heads.
7834975	7835676	If anything else.
7836104	7836745	Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft
7849974	7850715	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7869267	7871950	I think it was from their general company.
7871990	7873631	I don't think it was from their entertainment division.
7873811	7876734	Yeah, but at least Microsoft and Sony, they have all those other divisions of their company.
7876774	7877555	They're a huge, huge company.
7877575	7878476	It's not just about the games.
7878616	7880177	Still, still.
7882019	7890006	And I mean, it just... And then you think about it, Sega is like Sega having their bad luck streak with their games and whatnot, all the Sonic games and whatnot.
7890026	7892148	They didn't find out problems with...
7893169	7898051	Problems with their online gaming division and stuff like that.
7898111	7899312	I'm like, here we go.
7902253	7907255	If Sega was to go, then I'd be a lost sheep.
7907275	7909656	I would cry with you.
7911196	7915598	It's not just that, but just that all these companies are getting swallowed up by other companies, too.
7915698	7916579	You know what I mean?
7917199	7919640	Like Koei and Tecmo.
7921400	7925765	Dark Knight, anything else on your mind before we let you go tonight?
7925805	7931770	Um, just want to wish y'all guys a happy holidays and be safe and enjoy your presents and everything like that.
7931831	7932011	And, phew.
7942830	7943250	We will do.
7944231	7945371	And see y'all in 09.
7945531	7947032	I'm going to play with my pest dispenser.
7947072	7948753	Just open, close, open, close, open, close.
7948793	7949213	All night long.
7949613	7950194	It's going to be awesome.
7950234	7952074	It's Klingon's on a starboard belt, Captain.
7952475	7952735	All right.
7953535	7954015	Take care.
7954035	7955196	Take care, Dark Knight.
7955416	7955976	Have a safe one.
7955996	7956937	Do say.
7957097	7957277	Bye.
7958971	7960472	We're going to close up the Skype line for now.
7960552	7962833	Sorry we didn't take a lot of calls tonight, but damn, it's cold out here.
7964093	7966755	I do want to give a quick plug before we close our doors tonight.
7966795	7973018	I want to give a quick plug to our buddies over at Under Sedation Live, Travis Donovan and DMN.
7973178	7975459	Actually, no, I think he's officially retired that title now.
7975939	7978502	I think he's Insanist officially now, John.
7979603	7984248	Whatever his name is, he co-hosts the show over there Saturday nights on All Games Radio.
7984628	7989093	They are putting together USOLR Madness 2009.
7989293	7993337	Oh, I'm being corrected by the chat room.
7993357	7994718	His new name is Brest Lowell.
7995439	7996540	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob
8013789	8014849	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8039718	8045242	You can send in those emails with your top 25 games to uslmadness at gmail.com That's all one word.
8045602	8053847	Or you can look for more information on our forums at orangelaunceradio.com and I'm sure plenty of other information as well at Understation Live's website.
8055328	8055628	Alright.
8056789	8058730	That's going to do it though tonight for Orange Lounge Radio.
8058750	8062452	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.
8062812	8063913	We wouldn't do it without you guys.
8064033	8064593	It's awesome.
8066792	8067012	DarkSakura
8086495	8088356	I was just looking at it out of, you know, huh.
8088856	8089976	Not a bad job, though.
8090417	8091377	Yeah, it's all really good.
8091417	8092357	I mean, it's growing.
8092557	8095558	I'm really... Mine just... The last time... Wikipedia.
8095678	8101540	The last time I looked at it, mine just said, tune into this show to hear about Rob's life, which I thought was funny.
8102261	8104582	There's a link to my MySpace.
8104602	8106802	That's cute because I never update it anymore.
8107042	8107703	I will say this.
8107963	8108563	My final thought.
8108583	8109203	I'll do my final thought.
8109223	8110103	I'll do Loki's final thought.
8110123	8111604	My final thought is shit cakes.
8111904	8112664	Loki, your final thought.
8113845	8114005	Um...
8115208	8120111	I think that the different levels in this have different difficulties, so I'm skipping ahead to Final Fantasy 7.
8120411	8129457	I was going to play them in order, but apparently Final Fantasy 1 is like a level 5 or 5 star, and that's kind of hard, because I got my ass kicked pretty quick.
8129717	8131458	I still kind of want to see a little more about this game.
8131498	8134159	Do you have a... Oh, you can't use the video thing to play.
8134179	8139823	No, I tried that later, because there was an update that they allowed PlayStation Network software to do...
8140403	8145204	to be able to output, but it's only classic PlayStation games, and that sucks.
8146384	8147005	That's bullshit.
8147545	8150265	Speaking of classic PlayStation games, I got Castlevania Chronicles this week.
8150866	8151306	Good times.
8151826	8152146	Good times.
8152566	8154066	Oh, hey, we're going to close out the show now.
8154086	8156807	Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting.
8157167	8157347	Huh?
8158047	8159728	I didn't do my... I thought we did your final thought.
8159748	8160368	No.
8160528	8161908	All right, then, DarkSakura, your final thought.
8162388	8163869	It's freaking cold in here.
8163929	8165249	I thought your final thought was about your wiki.
8166420	8166880	Oh, it was?
8167121	8167721	Yeah, it's alright.
8167841	8168722	You can talk about the cold.
8170163	8171504	The cold froze my brain.
8171844	8172084	Alright.
8172745	8173345	That's going to do it.
8173365	8176508	Thank you so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting and shows like ours.
8176528	8177668	We wouldn't be able to do it without you.
8177728	8180190	Tune in next week for our year-end special.
8180310	8183653	Although, I don't know if we're doing that much special for it because it's kind of on a weird day.
8184153	8186295	And Bobby's doing a year-end special right before us.
8186335	8188857	So we might just do a non-special year-end special.
8189477	8190878	However, we will do listless.
8190918	8191678	You can be sure of that.
8191738	8193640	So we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8194020	8194260	Bye!
8210510	8211191	or allgames.com.
8211231	8212452	But we're probably right anyway.
8212472	8213033	See you next week!
