7000	13000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Moloto
13000	19000	Tonight, December 21st, 2008, many game companies lay off their employees this holiday season.
19000	27000	LittleBigPlanet gets some big updates, and has a recent Xbox Live Arcade game been ported to the 8-bit Nintendo?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Happy Holidays, y'all. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	43000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Santa, Jamie Summers.
49000	50000	What?
50000	52000	DarkSakura, of course. How you doing?
52000	56000	I am. I'm doing, um, crampy.
56000	58000	Ho, ho, ho.
58000	60000	Bop fucking hump.
60000	64000	Try having cramps around Christmas, you'll curse your uterus.
64000	66000	Did Santa bring you cramps for Christmas?
66000	67000	That and a migraine.
67000	69000	Maybe you were a bad girl.
69000	74000	Fuck, I was. I'd rather have coal, because then I could light it on fire and be warm.
74000	77000	Say hello as well to the one and only, Techmaster Loki.
77000	78000	Hello.
78000	81000	One of Santa's elves. Joining us to North Pole.
81000	82000	Yes.
82000	84000	That's correct.
84000	85000	Highly accurate.
85000	86000	How are you this week?
86000	87000	I'm doing fine.
87000	89000	Anything exciting planned for the holidays?
89000	92000	Um, yes.
92000	95000	All right, then. Can you tell us about it?
95000	97000	Well, I will in just a minute.
97000	98000	Oh, well, okay then.
98000	103000	Well, you should already know what it is, but, like, there's lots of stuff leading up to that.
103000	106000	Well, sometimes I play stupid for the sake of the listeners.
106000	107000	Oh, I'm sorry.
107000	109000	It gets you to retell the story, even though you might have already told me.
109000	111000	Sometimes I don't know when you're pretending.
111000	113000	Radio magic. Radio magic.
113000	116000	There's commentary in the chat room, Rob, about you saying y'all.
116000	121000	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com. Do they not like the y'all? Am I not allowed to say that because I'm from NorCal?
121000	122000	You didn't say it right.
122000	123000	Oh, what was I supposed to say?
123000	124000	Y'all.
124000	126000	Y'all.
126000	129000	Or, depending on certain parts, Ewins.
129000	130000	Ewins?
130000	131000	Yep.
131000	132000	All right.
132000	138000	And Jayrod in chat wants to point out, my girlfriend also has cramps. Coincidence or evil plot?
138000	142000	We're here to make your Christmas suffer, you know, a little bit.
142000	147000	Could it be a conspiracy? Are all the gamer chicks on one big cycle? That's what I want to know.
147000	151000	And only unless we've all been hanging out in the same room for at least two months.
151000	156000	Did you know, Rob, here's your unwanted education.
156000	157000	Oh, lordy.
157000	161000	That if you get women living in the same place for long enough, their cycles will align.
161000	163000	No, I've heard it. That's why I was making the joke.
163000	169000	That all the gaming girls, you know, somehow via Xbox Live, I don't know, have all gotten on the same cycle.
169000	171000	Man, I'm a suck in college.
171000	175000	Yeah, actually, because-
175000	177000	Like, everybody hide, it's the two-
177000	180000	No, it was actually true for my dorm.
180000	181000	I could bet.
181000	190000	Because I had a suite. So me, my roommate, and our suite mate were all like, chocolate wine, now.
190000	196000	Of course, we were poor, so it was, you know, Strawberry Hill or Apple Wine.
196000	197000	Mad Dog?
197000	198000	Yeah, yeah.
198000	203000	We at least had the taste to get the tasty Boon's Farm stuff.
203000	204000	Nice.
204000	205000	And Everclear.
205000	206000	Alright.
206000	207000	Because it was Alabama, and you could get Everclear.
207000	208000	Alright.
208000	214000	Anyhow, look, we're going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week, because we always start off the show.
214000	217000	Not How Was Your Vagina, but How Was Your Gaming Week, Dark Sakura.
217000	219000	How Was Your Vag- Gaming Week.
219000	220000	I played Vagina Wars.
220000	221000	No kidding.
221000	223000	Um, what?
223000	224000	Nothing.
224000	231000	Um, I actually turned on my DS and then turned it right off when I got a phone call and forgot to play again.
231000	234000	I played some Ragnarok, because I'm still playing.
234000	235000	Ooh.
235000	242000	And I've decided that I might actually go back to World of Warcraft for just a little bit, just to see what the new expansion's like.
242000	243000	But I really don't think I'll stick with it.
243000	248000	It's more of a, huh, why not, while I'm waiting for the Star Trek MMO.
248000	253000	I'm going to warn you, if you're not at least level 55 in World of Warcraft, you won't see anything in the new expansion.
253000	255000	It's all endgame content and a new class.
255000	256000	That's it.
256000	258000	So, sadly, there won't be a lot there for you.
258000	260000	I want to play a Draenei.
260000	262000	Draenei's are fun.
262000	268000	And name her, um, I don't know, I had a name I was going to name her, but I forgot.
268000	273000	Because the Draenei women talk like Natasha from Rocky and Bewinkle.
273000	275000	Boris, look, he's moose and squirrel.
275000	278000	He's fearless leader, darling.
278000	281000	I guess that would suit.
281000	284000	But, um, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
284000	285000	What?
285000	291000	I, um, I am going to, in the next week, download Shoei Nikki.
291000	293000	Oh, I know what else it was.
293000	297000	I actually sat and watched a playthrough of Abadox.
297000	299000	And how was that?
299000	302000	Just as shitty as I remember.
302000	304000	God, that game's hella old isn't it?
304000	309000	It's old and hard, and I love that game, but it is kind of a crap game.
309000	313400	Cuz it's like that's from Gradius huh, that's from life force hmm. That's from Gradius hmm. That's from life force
313840	316880	The one unique thing about it was the down scrolling levels
317400	321280	That was kind of as opposed to up scrolling from life force exactly there you go
322240	324240	Loki how was your gaming week?
324400	328000	I played more Grand Theft Auto on PC
328680	330680	and
331600	336960	I've actually started tweaking some stuff now because they've made it a little bit easier for you to actually edit stuff in the game
336960	340960	You just kind of have to know what you're doing. It's a little bit like the cheat device was on
341680	344640	The Grand Theft Auto's on PSP similar type of stuff
344640	350520	You know you have a file that you edit some of the amounts with actually it's a lot easier on the PC version because everything's
350520	352520	labeled for you, so I made a
353120	357240	Pistol that would catch a cop car and fire in one shot, and that was funny
358640	363920	But just some of that stuff then the game crashed because I shot too many cars and caught him on fire
363920	366520	Apparently didn't like that much fire at one time
368560	371160	But it's kind of like finding a balance you know between
372520	376760	Crazy shit and between fuego and non yeah well see my next thing
376760	384160	I want to do is because you can make your gunfire have so much kickback to it like if you shoot somebody
384160	389640	It'll knock them over or you can make them like fly away and that type of stuff, so I want to do that
389640	396440	But I also want to have the trainer where I have infinite health so I can basically you know catapult myself with rockets
396560	399540	You know across the map that might be fun, so
400600	405400	You know eventually I'll do that, but there aren't that many mods out there for right now. There's like a drifting mod
406280	410720	a mod that changes the car names to I guess realistic cars and then
411720	416280	You know the rocket pistol thing which I was trying to do that myself and the first time it
416280	420000	Glitched it out where I actually couldn't select that pistol anymore
420000	425920	But then I figured out what I was doing wrong, and I don't know it's just not quite to where I need it to be yet
426320	431080	But soon it will be and then of course you know more Grand Theft Auto 4
431680	433360	multiplayer at work
433360	435360	and that's still fun and
437160	439840	Other than Grand Theft Auto I've been playing
440640	444720	Dissida the new Final Fantasy fighting game and it's
444720	446720	awesome
447680	451040	You know it's kind of really cool because it's one of those games like you purchase it
451040	454040	And then they have the prologue video, and it's like
454760	459440	Listen, I know you're a fan of Final Fantasy, and I want to assure you that this was an excellent choice
459440	465360	And then they kick your ass with a really awesome intro video, and then the game itself is pretty fun
465520	470560	It's a little hard for me to play because I don't understand Japanese so the game rapes you, but consensually
470560	478080	In a gentle way that you appreciate it. It's gentle rape. All right. It's just like it's like oh my god
478080	480560	This is awesome. That can't be rape if you're willing
481520	484840	So just say that's like a roleplay thing. Maybe it's a bit of a
486160	493040	Sadism I see it would be like a hot chick all of a sudden getting naked and thrusting herself upon you
493320	497800	But like see you're at first you're kind of like whoa what's going on here, but then you just go with it
497800	502240	So yeah, it's I wouldn't know I haven't had that happen
503000	510840	But no, it's it's really really awesome. It really kind of disappoints me though that they haven't brought. I wish they would make this I
512680	518720	Put it on like the ps3 or something like that and then also expand upon it because you know this is as basically fighting
519040	521720	That's all it is they have a little bit of cutscenes and stuff like that
521760	525240	But there's no actual like you know role-playing running around that kind of stuff
525240	531080	But they kept the fighting system in here and like say did a Kingdom Hearts type of thing where you have all the different characters
531080	532440	from the different games
532440	537080	They could really have a kick-ass game on their hands, but you know this is that itself is gonna be really awesome
537080	542680	So DJ Dark Knight in chat at chat.org.com jokes. This is a aka or guys, too
542800	549240	No, it's not even close to urgots. No way. That's not it's not even
549840	551400	remotely close
551400	556440	But boy does it have a funky name just like you know square likes to really give their game some funky names
556440	559920	It does, but it's awesome. It really is awesome
559920	564680	I got the fight garland that was really cool, and it has it broken up by each game
564680	570200	So like I'm starting off with Final Fantasy 1 and so I'm playing the warrior of light
570200	573880	I guess or something and then I fought garland for the first level there and
574880	576880	Is the Warriors name AAA?
576880	583800	No, they has no name. It's just the warrior of light or poop. It's my cartridge. No. It's not poop
585520	586320	But it's cool
586320	591000	Look as you level up the characters they level up and all the other levels that they appear in as well
591000	597760	So I think I did have a party in Final Fantasy because I'm this mature. I think it was ass assy, but and poop I
599680	602440	Think the last time when we played it on because I have the
602440	610840	The WonderSwan one in Japanese. I actually sat down and tried to figure out the names to put in it in
611920	614200	Katakana, so we had Dan, Jamie
614920	619640	Dan made Eric for some reason one of his buddies who's kind of not all that all that bright
619640	622280	And I don't remember who we named the last one
623840	628640	My Chrono Trigger cartridge actually still has my friend save on it. It has me and there's Luca
628640	632240	But seriously though like, you know, not to interrupt or anything
632760	636200	This game could be like Kingdom Hearts, but without
636800	638480	You know the Disney characters
638480	641080	I mean if they for whatever reason lost the Disney license
641080	647600	They could easily do something like that with these characters and just some massive scale and it would be so much awesome
647960	649840	I want to point these
649840	655320	Observations out in the chat room shower and says did garland say I garland shall knock you out all down
655320	659840	And that was said at the exact same time as game grew asking to garland knock you all down
659840	664160	I don't know. It's in Japanese, so I can't read that but maybe he did in
664720	666720	Japanese I don't know
667920	669920	Alrighty then anything else you've been playing this week
672080	677480	Animal crossing played a little more animal crossing. I don't know why I'm still playing animal cross
677480	681320	I need to come visit Nellie's village. I know well the thing is I tried
681320	683080	you
683080	688880	Know I don't understand this you apparently you have to talk to some idiot in the town to get a friend code
689520	691520	What the fuck the guy at the gate?
692280	694760	All the last versions, too, okay, that's great
694760	698280	But why the hell do I have to talk to somebody you have a friend codes assigned to the game?
698280	700720	It's stupid that way it connects to Nintendo Wi-Fi
701760	704520	The first time I can extend it also is different per player
705320	708700	Yeah, yeah, and so yeah what you want you get it from Nintendo Wi-Fi
708700	711720	Then you can access it whenever in the game, so you just have to do it that one time
711720	715260	I'm fine, so I have to do that, but yeah, I haven't gone around to that yet. I
715900	718920	Will them awesome all right well then my gaming week
718920	720880	I played a little bit of Animal Crossing, but not a lot
720880	723760	I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff honestly it was a lot of the same stuff
723760	725760	I've talked about in previous weeks Prince of Persia
725920	727440	World of Warcraft
727440	730920	And the only new game I really checked out this week was a dash
730920	736640	What's so damn funny over there dark Sakura? I hear her giggling. I was looking at uncyclopedia about lavas
736640	741160	This is full name lavas big-ass porcupine from hell Thompson Smith
743520	748720	Uncyclopedia is so string is also a picture of one of the little aliens bursting out of someone's stomach
749040	754540	Is this picture taken by hospital staff one minute after lavas was born cute little scamp wasn't he I?
755000	761120	Think somebody in chats that made a lavas joke something about oh Dan shadow says you think that's fun try playing chrono trigger and name
761120	763120	everyone lavas
763120	767680	And I don't know what that's supposed to do all right anyway um the only new game
767680	773160	I played this week was the free game. I love free games, and there was a free game to hit Xbox live this week
773160	776360	I don't know if y'all remember, but it's Doritos dash of destruction
776440	782320	Which was I think it was like I think it's an XNA game that somebody made or it was like concept forget one some type
782320	784120	Of contest. I don't know if it was next
784120	788620	I read it was a like try to come up with a concept for a game, and then they made a Doritos game
788620	796620	Yeah, which which actually kind of worked out because it does it doesn't like overdo it with the Doritos like doesn't beat the Doritos
796620	800900	Thing into you like you know obviously it's there, and there's definitely the product placement
800900	806680	But the game is so random like it otherwise really has nothing to do with tortilla chips or whatever you want to call Doritos
807180	812600	They you basically you can play as a truck or you drive around the town trying to deliver Doritos
812600	818020	But you know whatever it could be anything and or you can play a t-rex and chase said trucks
818020	820020	So it's kind of an interesting little cat-and-mouse
820540	824340	Concept and I gotta say you know it's better than yours as far as free games
824340	826460	Go is this something I would have paid money for
827980	829980	Probably not maybe
830180	831780	$5 maybe
831780	838040	But you know it's a cute little cat-and-mouse thing going on where you can you know play the truck trying to deliveries or you?
838040	841660	Can go and out try to eat the trucks, and you know that made it kind of fun
842180	845300	But I don't think it's anything it's gonna have like a lasting value to it
845300	848220	You know a lot of the levels kind of look the same plus you just would
848420	851260	Unexplainably get these power-ups that didn't seem to do a whole lot of anything
851740	856260	And the game it was handing out achievements like candy like it was really one of those games
856260	859580	It was like push start you got an achievement for pushing start
859580	863540	You know like that's how it kind of felt to me, but you know I'm sure the achievement whores will enjoy that
864620	868340	But it was you know again for free. It's really hard to complain
868340	873660	It is probably actually you know considering the free games. I can think of on Xbox live. We had what Yaris we had
873660	874860	a
874860	879620	Totem ball we had the shooter game Aegis wing that was that was pretty cool, too
879620	883580	I put this on about the same level so it's it's a it's a decent free game
883580	888380	Because considering it was product placement and my expectations were very very low
889540	893940	There's also it wasn't bad this hold them. Oh, yeah, Texas hold them was free for a little while
893940	897260	Yeah, that's true, but now it's not so that was more of a limited time for you
897260	901260	Yeah, you know what else is not free hmm apparently if you delete your copy of
901260	907620	Hexic HD mm-hmm you have to pay $10 to get it back really yeah, I didn't know that
907620	909500	I actually transferred hard drives this week
909500	911300	I finally got 120 gig hard drive
911300	917060	And did the transfer and it kind of freaked me out because when I did the transfer it said some files were corrupt and could
917060	922180	Not be transferred. I'm like shit. What did I lose? I haven't figured out what I've lost yet, so your marbles
922820	928460	Well besides that I mean like what on the Xbox 360 day. I lose. I hope it wasn't any of the rock band tracks
928460	933060	I'm just not gonna notice. They're gone, or if it was like hopefully it was one of like the crappy ones
933140	937820	We can always redownload them. That's true. What about the original rock band song so
938340	943700	You'd have to redownload them unless you sold them hmm if you sold it back
943700	947540	Then you're kind of screwed there. I did actually never did so I still know people who still have
948820	951740	I haven't checked I haven't checked to see what got corrupted
951740	957340	But I haven't played rock bands since the transfer so I would I know that was probably the largest chunk of my old hard drive
957340	960540	Was rock band songs because I have a lot of rock band songs
960540	965180	You know because I have the rock band one exported the entire no doubt album and just like at least
965380	970020	20 download songs on top of that so pretty crazy. Well. I finally bought a
972180	974180	Hard drive transfer thing that's not
974740	976300	part of Microsoft's
976300	980580	You know transfer kit. It's actually something to dump files to your hard drive and that kind of stuff
981260	984620	To get well on top of you know
984620	986860	potential modding things
987620	994580	To basically move the two popcap game saves that pop cap for some reason said no you can't transfer to us
994580	1001180	You know a memory unit. We're gonna be dicks about that, and then yeah, I love how on Twitter. They're like oh, yeah
1001180	1003180	We're looking into that
1004500	1008520	We're looking into I saw you got a response though that was basically they couldn't figure it out
1008520	1014600	No, the response was like you have to redownload the game like what the fuck does it have to do with my save file stupid
1014640	1016040	not like
1016040	1021680	Transferring the game talking about the save file well wait a minute though like I theorized a couple weeks ago in this first came up
1021680	1024080	Maybe this is something that was kind of out of their control like you know
1024080	1031080	They it's not out of their control all the other games before and after them have allowed me to move the save files
1031120	1035240	To a memory unit and you know move it to another hard drive
1035240	1039120	You know you may not be able to copy them to other you know profiles
1039120	1044120	I understand that that makes perfect sense, but not being able to move it at all. That's retarded
1044120	1049720	You know what else did that hexick HD won't let you move this thing so screw you
1050640	1055520	Microsoft and screw you popcap that's right, though. I'm gonna do it anyways. I will find a way
1055520	1059200	I know we have people from popcap that listen, so I I hope well
1059200	1062840	That's why it does not go on both, but you'll do and Zuma
1062840	1070840	For whatever reason your stupid save files won't move not the game the game is fine because I can delete it download it move
1070840	1075720	It whatever I need to do, but the save files will not move
1075720	1079160	And I'm assuming this is a big crisis in your house because Zuma is like no
1079160	1083800	It's not a big crisis, but it's annoying because if you know my wife principle of the thing yes
1083800	1088880	We put in a lot of time to you know Bejeweled 2 which I might add there the achievements are
1088880	1094520	damn near impossible to get but you know for whatever reason we put in a lot of time into it and
1095240	1101320	Especially Zuma. Zuma gets pretty hard too, and at least that I can get some achievements in but Bejeweled 2 is a bitch
1103200	1106760	But yeah, I don't want to lose all my progress in that you know it's a game
1106760	1110640	I don't care if it's a crappy game. It's still progress, and I don't want to lose it
1110960	1117160	But in the fact that you know I can understand hexick because they want you to buy the hard drives and that kind of stuff
1117160	1120720	I mean whatever, but the save files is just these two games
1121640	1128840	That won't let me transfer them everything else works like everything. I got all that stuff moved over and took forever, but it worked
1129520	1134480	But these two save files are just I don't know so I'm gonna try moving them with this one program that I got and
1134920	1138000	If that doesn't work, then I give up, so
1139080	1144280	Sj100 Matt wants to point out now if Nellie lost her excite truck save file, then shit would hit the fan yes
1144280	1146720	But it might give her another reason to play it again
1147240	1149760	I do want to say this is Matt brought up PopCap
1149760	1153480	I did play the new Bejeweled thing on Facebook
1153480	1155720	They have like a Bejeweled tournament thing on Facebook
1155720	1159300	Where you get like a minute to get as many points as you can and right now
1159300	1164480	I'm on the top of the leaderboard at least of my friends list because you can't see everybody you can see your friends list I got
1165000	1168400	55,000 in one minute I got really lucky with the chains
1168400	1172080	That's all I can say but I thought that was kind of cute that they put that on Facebook, so
1172080	1176680	Anyhow um so anything else for gaming weeks around anybody?
1176680	1179920	I played rock band like the first one yeah
1179920	1185000	Cuz that's what Julie got and I have to say I've forgotten how much I hate the rock band guitars
1185600	1192000	But now I remember cuz it was forced upon me, and I hate them. Why is that they're flimsy?
1192800	1197640	they may be better for strumming, but they most the time the keys stick on both of them and
1197640	1203060	They wouldn't sync properly for the wireless one, and it was just a pain in the ass and next time
1203060	1206340	I go over there is I'm bringing my guitar hero controllers
1207860	1212500	All right watch a lot of net stuff. I know isn't the Netflix thing on 360 great
1212500	1215600	I watched a documentary this week because now Netflix
1216340	1221620	No, Netflix got smart, and they added an HD category on their watch instantly things
1221620	1226540	I was looking at HD movies, and I watched a documentary because I've been all about the obscure documentaries on Netflix
1226540	1228960	I don't know why but I watched an obscure documentary about
1229340	1233380	The people that dress up as superheroes on Hollywood Boulevard and post for pictures
1233380	1236540	I care ethics called confessions of a superhero was the name of the movie and
1237340	1239980	It was interesting it was interesting seeing the reasons
1239980	1246300	Why people did it some did it because they were like obsessed with their character some people did it just another job some people did
1246300	1249420	It because they have issues a lot of issues Rob
1249420	1252760	I want to come over and watch documentaries with you now that I don't have school. It's fun
1252760	1258480	I said I have work. That's a sad thing. I have work, but not every day work. Yeah, I know
1259000	1263280	I'm gonna come come watch documentaries with you all right. Well. It's fun. Well a documentary night
1264040	1266400	We'll try to see who can find the most obscure document
1266400	1271400	There are some obscure documentaries on Netflix documentaries. I got a screener copy of
1272120	1275880	Eathletes uh-huh which if I remember correctly. I think that's the
1276480	1280960	Film that Scott Rubin actually did some of the shooting for it's about those two counter-strike teams
1280960	1286400	And they came to El Dorado Hills to do part of the tournament there
1286400	1290880	And he was filming a second unit or whatever on that that was kind of neat
1291800	1296920	Hmm, I don't haven't gotten a chance to watch it yet though tiger law points out. Yeah confessions of a superhero
1296920	1302120	I believe all games interactive interviewed the chick that plays Wonder Woman on it, and it may set suma back set up
1302120	1303960	You know I I did I was not aware of that
1303960	1307600	I kind of fell out of the loop of AGI just because they were putting out so many shows a week
1307600	1309600	And I couldn't listen to him because I had to teach all day
1309600	1314320	But the chick that played Wonder Woman was probably the most normal out of everybody in the movie
1314880	1319000	Absolutely she had some marital problems, but she seemed the most
1319680	1324240	Stable I mean no quote unquote normal out of anybody there was so she didn't to me
1324240	1326240	She didn't look a lot like Wonder Woman
1326720	1331800	Maybe yeah, maybe that sounds cruel, but I just I just didn't see the little her costume was decent
1331800	1337280	But I just didn't see like she did not look at like Wonder Woman as much as Batman looked like Batman or Superman
1337280	1340760	Look like Superman. There's only one only one Wonder Woman ever and
1341400	1346840	She was in the 70s, and she was freaking fantastic, and I really enjoyed seeing her in sky-high
1348840	1350720	Is you gonna say something lucky no
1350720	1356920	I thought it's I thought I've actually seen part of that show or Linda something that had to do with those people that were on
1357640	1362840	Hollywood Boulevard you might hostile one in chat says I've seen that doc they even said that people
1363200	1366720	Were protective like I'm the only one who can play Superman on this block
1366720	1368720	Yeah, perhaps I
1369080	1371120	Don't know. I don't remember
1371120	1373160	They didn't really get into the inner politics
1373160	1378680	But I thought it was really funny because like people like they like it was this big change when Elmo got arrested
1378680	1384960	And they showed the news stories like Elmo and mr.. Incredible got busted on Hollywood Boulevard this week
1385440	1392960	They joined the Cookie Monster in the interest for the way. They were harassing tourists or something like that. This is it was interesting
1392960	1397440	It's just funny to hear the news. I want some money for drugs give Elmo money
1397800	1403040	It was just funny to hear about Elmo getting arrested. I don't know why I'm easily amused all right look
1403120	1405520	Let's move on with the show talking about housekeeping tonight
1405680	1408860	If you were wondering there will be a show next week
1408880	1415060	There is still a show next week the holidays will not be getting in the way same bat time same bat channel although
1416200	1420440	Bobby the man who does the show before us is doing his annual year-end special
1420440	1423880	Next week, and he's gonna have some guests on his show and all that fun stuff
1424400	1428160	He might be starting a little early, and we might let him run a little late
1428680	1432040	To help our yeah, maybe details a little just a little
1432680	1437520	So we'll see but that means that means it made me realize that means next week is our year-end show I
1438200	1441860	Wasn't even thinking about it, but yeah next week's the year-end show can you believe it?
1442200	1449200	Yes, because it comes the same time every year. Yeah, and in there will be no show on the week of
1449200	1451200	January
1451480	1458560	11th there is no show. I'm gonna be in Hawaii. I will not be here the weekend of the 31st what cuz I'm going to Disneyland

1522160	1526160	That's like the entire original cast and the enterprise as a Pez dispenser
1526160	1530580	It's supposed to be limited, but I don't know that is friggin amazing
1530580	1532880	And most importantly I want to point out
1533460	1539740	Sulu George Takei does have his own Pez to censor. What'd you get there Sarah Ragnarok? Yes? Hi, dude?

1544540	1546540	Very nice

1590300	1596620	He's all right, and so it didn't have Bob Barker, or you know dude, dude, but pressure luck is epic
1596620	1599740	It's old school. That's amazing sure that's amazing

1625760	1628360	Yes, I don't know what that book is I didn't want to open it
1628360	1632920	You know so I don't know if that's the manual or like an art book or something that they threw in
1632920	1634920	I'm gonna open it right now
1635160	1637160	But I figured you know
1637160	1639160	Ragnarok
1639160	1642120	DJ dark night brought up something about the prices right there reminded me
1642120	1644200	Did you see the in chat room?
1644480	1648560	Did you see the talk about the guy on the price is right that nailed the showcase on the head the manual?
1649560	1654200	Yeah, I was joking about how I think that's that's a giant conspiracy
1656160	1658120	There's more in my life journal
1658120	1663840	Hitstun says does Ragnarok DS. Have any sort of online play. I think it's a few players like local
1663840	1669280	This is fantastic because you um you do your attacks and spell casting
1670480	1671680	by
1671680	1673680	stylus control
1677440	1679280	All right
1679280	1682480	Well, what a happy holiday. We have here on orange launch radio this week
1683760	1685920	Except for me. I'm a Grinch because I didn't fucking give out
1686800	1690080	Well, I'm I'm doing something different this year
1690080	1693040	It has this the skill trees in here
1693040	1697360	I just didn't want to forget these all in my house, and I started to get into the point now where I'm like
1697360	1702000	Whose gift is that whose gift is that? Oh crap? I gotta get rid of these nice
1703120	1705120	All right, whoo
1705120	1709840	Now that we are all bit. We've all been there's classes that are just for the um DS
1712000	1715120	We're gonna hear a little tidbits about Ragnarok DS all night long
1715120	1721520	There's a dark night. Yeah, if I DJ dark night and chat says Jamie wishes she could bring her online character to the DS game
1722720	1727120	Quite possibly my characters are like over a hundred and twenty something right now
1727120	1730400	So because I'm playing on private server. Yeah, I was gonna say plus you play on bootleg servers
1730400	1735360	So I don't think that would be a dark night's fucking hot. I like J-roz star trek peso spencer
1735360	1738240	What a thoughtful way to carry around your ecstasy
1740400	1742400	That's amazing
1742400	1744400	That's amazing
1744880	1748240	That's amazing. No. I love the star trek peso dispensers. That's great
1748240	1753280	You know I haven't really been like super into peso collecting in a while, but I still think stuff like this is so awesome
1753840	1759520	Especially the fact that it's all of them like you didn't have to buy each one individually wow it's limited edition, too
1759520	1763120	What a cool. Yeah, I saw that they have those at a cost plus
1764400	1768080	That is so rad. I was like dude. I kind of picked this up for Rob. That's amazing
1768080	1771040	Yeah, I thought about getting another imagine game this year for the DS
1771040	1774080	But I figured actually giving you something useful instead of you know
1776080	1781520	I'm putting pictures up in a second sweet all right, so anyway is that going on your Twitter all right?
1781520	1786960	Well, I'll link the picture in the chat room because my Twitter is blocked from almost everybody so oh you could log into the olr one
1787520	1791680	If you want all right, uh let's let's move on and get into some gaming news
1791680	1794640	You know that we're past past the holiday stuff listening now
1794640	1799680	We're gonna go some from such happy joyous wonderful news to not so great news tonight
1799680	1804160	Not so great news tonight, and I want you to listen to the first stories in tonight's
1804720	1809840	Show and see if they all have something in common because it's kind of sad actually it's kind of a bummer
1809840	1812640	We have to follow up such a positive stuff with this
1813760	1819440	Factor 5 has closed its doors the developer known for such games as lair
1820080	1825200	And some better games as star wars broke squadron and even like turrican series
1825200	1831520	Um and apparently they were being rumored to be working on the new kid Icarus and Superman games
1832640	1839680	But they have closed their superman 128. It's the curse of spider-man. I'm sorry. It's superman. I tell you it's just it's a new
1840560	1842720	Superman not tiny of the movie, but
1843920	1848960	So they have closed their doors, and it was supposedly confirmed by Matt Casamani
1849680	1852400	from IgM who had I believe
1852400	1854400	received an email from
1855680	1859120	Julian at Factor 5 says hi Matt. How have you been?
1860720	1863360	Wanted to contact you with some late-breaking news
1863360	1868400	We just learned inside sources that developer Factor 5 has officially closed the doors as of today
1868400	1872400	That's some pretty big news considering that those guys have been around for quite a while
1872880	1876800	It's definitely a real shame, and I hope this information is helpful to you
1877360	1879760	Do you know who we have to blame for this lair?
1879760	1882960	No, Ronald Regan. Why? Reganomics
1884960	1889680	Seriously, that's what caused um, that's one of the big contributors to our financial crisis right now
1889680	1895200	Well, perhaps it continues on in these other stories we're getting into such as about electronic arts
1896000	1898000	Electronic arts had to cut
1898880	1906400	1,000 jobs and closed like nine different publishing locations including one of them called black box studio
1906400	1911360	This is in addition to when they already laid off six percent of their staff back in October
1911360	1916560	So now it's just been basically an increase to a ten percent reduction overall. It was 1,000 employees
1917200	1919520	That are all being phased out by March 31st
1919520	1923040	So well, I guess hooray that some get to keep their jobs through the holidays, but still
1923680	1927920	Blackbox studio in Vancouver is going to be merged with the EA studio in nearby Burnaby
1929600	1932880	Wow, so this is going to save the company 120 million annually
1932880	1938000	But costing them about 60 million in restructuring charges while this goes on
1939280	1944240	Kind of a bummer for those folks that got laid off. Sorry to hear about I had some friends that worked at EA
1944240	1946800	I have no idea, you know, they're not people I talk to every day
1946800	1949520	So, I don't know if anybody I know isn't affected by this but still
1950480	1953120	My thoughts are with you guys. This is this is very unfortunate
1954320	1960320	Well, um, there actually is a going for midway to the rumor was that they were going to be laying out
1960320	1967920	Laying out laying off, um around 160 people from the Chicago studio for the most part because of financial issues
1969360	1976400	The official word is that they're laying 25 percent off of its workforce. So that's about 180 people
1977280	1980480	130 people from Chicago and 45 from Austin
1981680	1986400	The Austin operation itself has closed and then there's supposed to be some other
1986400	1991840	Games that were unannounced that are being suspended. So they're just trying to uh,
1992560	1999200	I guess mitigate, you know, whatever the costs are apparently the Mortal Kombat team is safe. We can all sleep
1999920	2001920	Easy, I think
2002640	2005200	Whatever. It's just crap
2007120	2008000	And
2008000	2010000	Even more upsetting for me
2010000	2016720	Free Radical has closed shop. Um, apparently their doors were locked and all the employees were locked out
2017280	2022640	While the company was having some final meetings deciding what the fate of the company was going to be
2023200	2025600	Of course Free Radical is known for the
2026240	2032320	Kind of a failure ps3 game haze but better known for their time splitter series as well as um,
2032960	2036000	Remember to be working on Star Wars Battlefront II
2036000	2041280	They were working on TimeSplitters IV. Um, so that kind of sucks
2042320	2044320	but um
2044320	2050960	The good news is though is they may not be out of work for long. Apparently some other companies are looking to
2052000	2057040	Purchase Free Radical and kind of absorb them into their
2057760	2058800	You know
2058800	2065360	Developing firms. So that's kind of good because I want to see TimeSplitters IV. It was kind of neat since they were
2066000	2066960	You know
2066960	2073200	Looking for new jobs. Some of the people are working on different art. We're releasing assets for TimeSplitters IV and oh man, it looked awesome
2074560	2081280	Also if that doesn't work out, the founder of Free Radical is setting up a new studio called Pumpkin Beach
2082000	2084800	And right now he's got 20 former
2084800	2088320	Free Radical developers and um,
2088960	2094160	You know, there's going to be that seems like a lot of development for just a week. Did this all happen this week?
2094720	2099040	Yeah, wow. Yeah. Um, so I guess
2099920	2105840	The guess will the the new studio had been formed a few months before this whole
2108080	2110080	I guess
2110080	2116080	Um, I guess, uh, the thing happened. So, you know, this was
2116880	2122160	You know working out before everything. Maybe he kind of figured that this was going to happen anyways, and so kind of a
2123020	2125020	precautionary measure but um
2126080	2128720	That's what I'm wondering if this guy didn't kind of see the writing on the wall
2129280	2135600	Maybe but um, yeah, hopefully some way or another that TimeSplitters IV comes out. That's really all that i'm concerned about
2135600	2140080	You know that and that these people have jobs, but mainly TimeSplitters IV
2140080	2144880	GameGuru in chat says this is what happens when you don't support the console that won. That's the Wii my friends
2145200	2150000	Oh, but wait a minute. Look at EA. They just laid off a bunch of people. They they've been big supporters of the Wii, right?
2151680	2153680	They've been sort of, yeah.
2154960	2160080	GameGuru says the economic crisis just accelerated the problem. I can't really say Free Radical
2160080	2166400	Wasn't supporting, you know, the Wii. They've only made one game since the new consoles have come out, you know, Haze, so
2167920	2169920	That's not really fair
2170560	2174800	Well, another company is seem to be cutting back on staff. It's uh,
2175440	2179360	I'm sorry, Asper is the name of the company and they are based out of Austin
2179920	2182080	They're probably most known for some of their porting work
2182080	2187360	They ported Call of Duty 4 and Sims 2 to the PC and the Mac respectively. They got hit with layoffs this week
2187360	2194100	They got hit with layoffs this week more than a dozen temporary full-time employees were laid off as well as some other regular employees
2194480	2198800	More layoffs are expected and the company also shut down internal servers
2199920	2203200	Also some other stuff they did Guitar Hero 3 they did that port
2203760	2211760	Wow, so, uh, no, uh comments out of Asper that I should note though that that story was just a rumor status only
2211760	2217360	Um, however, it unfortunately would not be surprising considering all the other news we're hearing this week
2218480	2219760	well
2219760	2221760	It's not really just those we've got
2222320	2223280	more
2223280	2224560	turbine
2224560	2226080	is um
2226080	2227600	going to be uh
2227600	2229600	cutting jobs
2229980	2231360	according to uh
2231360	2238480	What they're saying is that they are actually going to be um, they didn't say how many but the quote says as part of this transition
2238480	2242400	Some of our talented colleagues will not be with us going forward
2244080	2248400	So ouch yeah, in other words are like oh fuck bye
2250880	2252560	Really
2252560	2259280	So let me point out that's one two three four five six companies in one week
2259840	2264160	That have all done some type of layoffs right before Christmas right before the holidays assholes
2264160	2271520	Although granted some of them have uh, you know our um, like ea was transitioning them out on march 31st or whatever
2271760	2275280	But some of them just came to work and found that the doors and windows were all locked
2275760	2282000	Which is I don't know kind of messed up. It's it's just sad. I mean that reminds me of when dan got laid off in the money store
2282560	2286960	Really? Is that what happened similar? They just went in found a bunch of people walking out with stuff
2287040	2289040	And so they're like, um, just pack your desks and go
2290160	2291600	wow
2291600	2293600	My gosh, they bribed us to stay
2293600	2295040	um
2295040	2299040	Here's my question. Is this going to continue? I mean this was six in a week
2299040	2304080	Are we gonna see more throughout the next few weeks or what's gonna happen? Blame Reagan blame Bush
2306560	2313920	I I who's next blame the Republicans. Well, wait a minute though. Let's not get too political here
2315520	2322360	Seriously if you look at it historically the reason why you're wearing all this financial shit is because of
2322360	2327880	of reagan's whole reaganomics crap and the fact that you know people have decided just to
2328440	2332440	You know screw us over instead of you know, putting money back into the economy where it goes
2332520	2336120	You know, we're spending money on a war. We didn't need to spend you know money on
2336840	2338680	And all this other bullshit
2338680	2342920	It just should have looked out what the country needs and go for the best thing and now as a result
2342920	2347880	We're seeing and it's not just this there's other companies like I went to uh old fulsome
2347880	2354600	Today and I say yesterday and at least a third of the old shops there were either closed or going out of business
2355560	2357720	The coffee place I go to they close down without a word
2358440	2364200	It's just you're seeing more and more businesses closing down. It's not just in the video game industry
2364920	2369160	Regardless of you know, whatever path we took to get here. How are we gonna get out?
2369400	2374040	I guess would be my question is I mean is the end in sight are we gonna get out of this anytime soon?
2374040	2378120	What's it gonna take? I mean, do we just need to buy more video games or what?
2379720	2386680	Well, it's a lot more complex than that. I mean a lot of it is going to be consumers, you know having more faith
2387640	2390680	In the industries and you know putting their money into product
2391320	2397320	But um, it's also going to mean that to be able to put money into the purchase of products
2397640	2402680	There need to be the jobs available. So it's very much right now a catch-22 damn if you do damn if you don't
2402680	2405080	It's it's really gonna take
2405720	2410680	I think the companies being able to be in a financial position to where they can start hiring again
2410920	2417960	And start putting out more product so that these people who now have fresh incomes can go out and put their money back into the the
2418520	2423640	Money flow. Oh, we'll see what happens in 2009. Hopefully it won't be much longer. We'll see though
2424440	2430840	Moving on um, you know all this news makes us very sad and upset and angry that all these uh,
2430840	2435640	Great game studios are just closing their way on well some not so great, but they're all closing their doors
2435640	2440680	Uh, it just stinks the whole thing stinks. And so we uh dedicate the fus of the week to uh,
2441640	2443640	Those without a job this week
2443640	2461960	Is that a job this week my first fu goes towards my girl bits for hurting me and causing you pain
2462440	2465400	Therefore I have to turn around and hurt other people and cause them pain
2465800	2469640	Because they don't have to endure this type of thing. So we have to share it with them somehow
2469640	2477080	Um, also, um an fu goes um on behalf of one of my friends who didn't necessarily say this herself
2477320	2479320	But i'm passing it on for her
2479560	2483960	Um to uh the lack of uh proper transplants for her dad
2484440	2489880	um, she is a really good friend of mine from college and I hope that her dad gets uh, the liver and
2490520	2492520	other organs he needs soon because
2492920	2494680	He really really needs it
2494680	2501080	And um, my my final fu goes again towards the bullshit that um, bush is pulling
2501720	2505560	In you know in his last few days god, I can't wait till he's gone
2507560	2508440	Loki
2508440	2512200	Um fu to rude people at the stores, especially this time of year
2512440	2515800	Uh, there was some lady in front of us when we were trying to buy some
2516360	2520620	You know gifts and first off she's taking forever with her transaction
2520620	2525660	And kept wanting to you know, do idle chit chat and then when she was done
2526060	2532860	Uh, she sat there and started packing her crap into her purse for a good like three or four minutes
2533260	2540700	We're still waiting there trying to like get our shit done like the checkers already, you know running ourselves by and you know
2540860	2544540	She's just sitting there going, you know, trying to talk to the person stuff
2544540	2548060	I was like get the fuck out of my way you stupid whore
2548060	2554140	So a few rude people and then there's a ton of people can't drive correctly, especially now in the rain. So
2554700	2556700	Screw them, too
2557020	2560380	um, my a few of the week goes to the fact that i'm
2561180	2567020	Feeling pains in my side and I don't know if i'm just imagining it or if it's something weird happening again or what have you
2567020	2570460	I'll try to go to the doctor. Maybe it is my uterus. I don't know but you know
2570460	2575420	I don't know like I just get freaked out. It's been a hell of a year. I just want 2008 to go die in a fire
2575420	2579020	First of all, I would like to uh, tell the entire chat room
2579580	2587580	Don't wish assassination, you know, that's you're wishing murder on somebody however complete incapacitation of both bush and cheney
2587900	2594460	Would be fantastic if someone were to do that because that would put flossie in charge until obama takes over she is a speaker of the house
2595340	2600140	All right. I want to know uh, and my other a few goes to uh, selfish people
2600860	2602860	That's it
2602860	2608380	All right, in uh early 2009, we'll be receiving a brand new game
2608940	2616300	From the creator of such wonderful games as katamari damasi and all the other sequels. Um,
2616940	2621820	Takahashi, um is releasing nobi nobi boy on the playstation network and
2622380	2626700	They had a few videos that came out this week for it and I still don't know what the hell this game's about
2626860	2630060	It's like you're this stretchy thing that
2630060	2635500	Tries to hook a bunch of things up with your body and I don't know what exactly that's supposed to be for
2635900	2638700	But apparently, uh, you can stretch your body
2639500	2641500	You can devour things
2642700	2647740	I'm not really sure what exactly you do, but it's supposed to be coming out in japan
2648380	2650940	on january 29th for 800 yen
2651820	2656380	And uh the us probably around the same time so early 2009
2656380	2660860	But man, this game is weird and it's not like that trailer that we saw. It's not 2d at all. It's just
2661900	2666060	Weird well, you know, we did say that katamari damashi was weird, right?
2666620	2672140	Yeah, but this looks really weird like even like katamari. I you know, you could watch a trailer and get it
2672140	2677820	You know, you just oh you roll over things and your ball gets bigger this is like it's giant tube thing eating things and
2678140	2680140	Tying things up with its body
2680460	2682940	I don't get what the point is. That sounds fantastic. It's like
2682940	2689340	Bizarro snake it is like a bizarro snake. It's like, you know, everyone's like all happy and stuff and he starts eating people
2689340	2694380	And it's like oh my god. This isn't good at all eating people is great
2695900	2700060	Nom nom nom. Nobby. Nobby's made of people. It's good
2702380	2707840	Hey little big planet got some updates this week. You got two patches back to back 1.06 and 1.07
2707840	2714960	1.06 now it uh, it upgraded the moderation feature of the game, which a lot of people would say was badly needed
2715920	2722560	Now your unpublished levels can be edited by creators. They will not be erased for Evers and believe it or not
2723200	2726960	You'll now get an explanation when your level is moderated. Tadaa!
2727680	2731600	Finally after all that bitching and moaning some updates to the moderation
2732400	2737120	1.07 was also a good one. It was a good one. It was a good one. It was a good one
2737120	2743200	1.07 was also released like almost back-to-back this week and now you can actually find user-created levels a lot easier
2743280	2748560	Apparently the cool levels has a different algorithm. So it's not just a bunch of trophy whoring levels anymore
2748880	2750960	Which is kind of cool. I actually went in there and looked and it actually
2751600	2756400	It was some different stuff in there, which is kind of cool. And now they've also added the little big store
2757200	2759680	Kind of like how they added the store and rock band a little later on
2759680	2763520	Well now they have a another world that you go into. Well, it's it's still earth
2763520	2768320	but it shows the little pictures of little suits and other things that you have yet to buy and
2768960	2773680	Confirms which stuff you have already purchased for the game. So that's kind of cool and also very cool
2773680	2777760	You know, they I know a medium molecule and Sony in general took a lot of shit for the moderation
2777840	2780960	It's nice that they are making attempts to fix it. Thank you
2781760	2783120	What?
2783120	2784800	This is just what?
2784800	2786240	What?
2786240	2789440	I clicked on the link in the chat room. Uh-huh that was
2789440	2794560	Uh posted by tiger claw, uh, which I think we're covering later in the show. Okay, then never mind. Yeah
2796320	2798000	That's what I get
2798000	2800560	Well, how about some different news about sing star?
2801840	2807360	they're doing wireless microphones that will be out next year and um
2809360	2811360	They're uh
2811600	2816240	Actually, uh saying that there's going to be a hundred uh trial packs also
2816860	2818320	available to
2818320	2821200	Uh, I guess just a number of different sing star
2822400	2824400	followers on their myspace
2824800	2828020	But the packs are going to be two wireless microphones usb receiver
2828960	2832960	a mini b usb cable and four double a batteries
2833840	2835040	so
2835040	2838320	Like I want one for sing star abba, which by the way
2838960	2844320	There is now a sing star abba theme in the playstation network store that you can download for your ps3
2844320	2848880	What that you I don't know we know it all yet, but you know, it's coming out next year
2849280	2854480	What here that's coming out also in europe or may have already come out what sing star queen?
2854960	2858320	Oh cool. I heard about things. I heard there was there was a queen one coming out
2858560	2861040	I'm, totally gonna buy that in the us now. Awesome
2861600	2866160	That is exciting because queen is all sorts of awesome queen is very awesome
2866800	2870160	Oh, it's gonna have the videos and everything. I bet huh? So rub. What is your favorite queen?
2870240	2873440	That's gonna be amazing. You know, I have to stick with the old um
2873440	2875440	uh, bohemian rhapsody, but
2876080	2878400	I do have a big love for bicycle
2879360	2880720	What about you matt?
2880720	2889040	Uh, bohemian rhapsody and no one or was it a no one wants to live forever. I think my favorites would be um
2890160	2895760	Um somebody to love that's my favorite of all time. And oh, that's a great song. My second is killer queen
2896960	2900240	These are all good songs. I can't wait for this game. That's gonna be amazing
2900240	2904960	You know, the only thing that would be better would be sing star journey, you know, I had to say it sing star heart
2905520	2910400	See now it would only be good. I think that these are just a queen pack for a rock band. So that'd be a lot better
2910400	2911600	Yeah
2911600	2913600	They do need to have sing star butt rock
2914240	2916800	That would be amazing. It's poison and motley crew
2917760	2919760	and uh
2919920	2926320	That would be sweet. Uh, and I have to have cinderella and dakken and night ranger
2926320	2928320	And night ranger
2929600	2933280	And dan yankees because of ted nugent well other things
2934400	2941840	Nugent everything's awesome. And also from sony, uh pots upon two is um out in japan right now
2941920	2943920	But it will be coming
2944640	2947060	to other regions in early 2009
2948460	2951520	february and probably north america and um
2951520	2956720	Yeah pot upon is actually pretty cool. I didn't get to play a lot of the game. I just kind of gave up on it
2956720	2958720	After a while, but it was fun
2958720	2963120	Definitely unique little game and you know, i'd like to see more in that crazy style
2963120	2968160	But i'd also like to see it like on other systems, you know, I don't want to have to always bring out the psp to play this
2969280	2972580	Port that shit because it'd look awesome on the ps3
2972580	2980500	Because it'd look awesome on the ps3 pata pata pata would it it was a very interesting little game
2980900	2983620	Rob i'm cold. It would be even better
2984260	2986340	a heater if the buttons um
2987140	2990900	Spelled out or sung out of damn yankees songs. That'd be great
2991940	2992820	I
2992820	2999540	Hate everything about your mother. That wasn't damn yankees. No, I oh i'm thinking that was ugly kid joe. I'm, sorry
2999540	3004020	I'm thinking uh high enough was damn yankees, wasn't it? Because it's fucking ted nugent
3006820	3011140	Ted nugent eats meat and shoots guns. I like this man
3013620	3016740	Uh, all right, I saw him on tv skinning a deer
3019540	3021540	Ted nugent's fucking hot
3022660	3025860	Uh, unfortunately won't be able to skin a deer a little big planet, but
3025860	3029140	You will get paint guns, which is kind of cool. I mean
3029140	3034260	I do have a challenge out there for you folks to make a level where you do skin a deer. You can probably do that
3035220	3037460	I have to actually I have to go back to ronma
3038100	3040100	Queens ryke is the shit
3040180	3047060	Although you misspelled it because queens the lead singer of queens ryke is a trained opera singer and he's just got this fantastic voice
3047220	3051460	Anyway, i'm sorry. That's right. I would like to see um sack boy's house of blood in um
3051460	3057780	Um in little big planet. I want to see some really I did disturbing levels one time and I I just never got around to
3057780	3063460	Actually trying to make anything in this game, but you know thought about it making a saw themed level
3063460	3065780	But you know, I couldn't figure out how I could
3066420	3068420	You know do that
3068740	3073140	I don't know. Well, maybe some of the new items in the metal gear solid pack will help you because yeah
3073140	3074580	They're getting paint guns
3074580	3079060	Um now apparently you're going to get a paintball gun that you can use to actually shoot down enemies and all this stuff
3079060	3084580	Apparently trophies are being added go figure like 11 trophies are being added in this pack
3084580	3091540	But here's what I don't understand about this is that I I was assuming that the metal gear solid thing was for users to create levels
3092100	3093940	But it is but so why?
3094500	3099940	Why then are there these new trophies because shouldn't I get to play it still if somebody else makes the level using it?
3099940	3101540	Or am I going to get locked out? Here's the thing
3102420	3104820	This level pack you're downloading you get
3104820	3110900	It's a level and then you get objects including this paintball gun from the plane that level and there's trophies tied in with
3111220	3115860	The few levels that are there basically the levels are to teach you how to use the paintball gun because
3116260	3118820	The paintball gun is going to allow you to make shooter games now
3118820	3124020	They're going to have objects that will detect how many hits with the paintball gun before they are destroyed
3124260	3128820	Also remember before how people were trying to create objects that like shot bullets and stuff
3128820	3136180	Well, now they have some sort of like energy blast things that come out of them. It's a new sort of like damaging object
3137060	3140500	That's going to be available and you'll get all those by playing through levels
3141140	3145300	So that's gonna be awesome then it that is a very major download
3145860	3150260	Instant purchase from me. I'm also well. I'm happy to hear the media molecule is doing some of this
3151300	3157060	Themselves because the levels they did were some of the best honestly they really really were it it was a very
3157060	3163220	They really really were it it looks really cool. I mean it if you watch the trailer for it very very cool looking
3163380	3167780	Yeah, I do watch the trailer. It looks very cute. I just didn't understand how it worked a little bit contra
3167860	3173060	Well now I understand well, hey now this is also kind of neat is that they're also getting some level packs not just for this
3173060	3175460	But they I guess this just came out this past week
3175860	3178580	Um, I don't remember seeing it on the store, but I didn't really look very hard
3178820	3183560	Um, the holiday pack is now apparently out. It was supposed to come out december 18th for 299
3183560	3191660	and uh, it's the festive level pack and it's supposed to contain two new costumes some new material new objects six new decorations
3192120	3198520	And tons and tons of tons of new stickers, but however, um with this pack levels themselves are not apparently included
3199320	3201960	So, but they just have the stickers though. Yeah
3203480	3207640	So I guess you put this in your own levels or what have you because you can create new, you know
3207960	3211880	Christmas tree looking things and you know everything with the stickers. Hey speaking of stickers
3211880	3215880	When are we going to get that feature where I can uh put photos from the hard drive into the game?
3216200	3218600	Because that's that's the other big thing we're waiting on
3219160	3221500	But it was in an advertisement. It's false advertising
3222200	3224200	bitch wine moan
3224360	3226360	Right, you're never going to get it
3226840	3228840	I wish maybe next year. We'll see
3229480	3231480	Well, this is something that's pretty cool. Um
3232120	3237800	You know, uh on xbox live there was the um, super street fighter 2 turbo hd remix
3239000	3240440	well, um
3240440	3244360	It's uh sold a quarter million. Wow. There's a lot of suckers out there
3244760	3249560	Well, I I have it. I like it. I've got so many different versions of street fighters. Not even funny
3250040	3253640	That's 250 000 people sucking the cock of nostalgia. It's
3254360	3258920	It's basically broken both day one and week one sales records
3259800	3261160	and um
3261160	3266200	Is uh slated to break 30-day sale records as well. So it's supposed to be the the um
3266200	3271720	Oh, actually according to capcom. It's quoted as saying it's honest way to becoming the highest grossing digital title ever
3272280	3275800	Besides that they had the good sense to use udon crew to do their art. So that's pretty cool
3278680	3280680	Very cool they didn't sell one to me
3281400	3282840	well
3282840	3287720	Unfortunately this week there aren't that many choices for you to go purchase stuff. I mean it is
3288360	3294440	the week of christmas and a lot of game publishers aren't exactly putting their games out this week because uh,
3294440	3301720	That's not a lot of time to purchase them. But there are a few that are putting out their games and um, well
3302920	3305080	They're games. All right, um
3305880	3312520	Candace canes candy factory on the ds is coming out this week. Also the sport comic book creator
3312520	3319000	I don't really know if that's a game. That's more software, I think but it's coming out nonetheless. Um,
3320200	3322200	Let's see here
3322200	3324200	Let's see here
3326280	3328280	And
3328840	3333080	Man talk about a short week mystery pi portrait of a thief on ds
3335160	3341160	And I swear that I think that's it that is it that is sad
3344600	3350680	Well, it is kind of a quiet week as well over in japan because they usually get new releases on thursday and what's thursday
3350680	3352680	Oh, yeah christmas
3352840	3359960	So, um on the xbox 360, uh alone in the dark and sid meyers civilization revolution finally come out on

3414040	3416920	But it's on the wii and I can't figure out like is this the old school?
3417560	3420920	Resident evil being redone because I don't think it's resident evil 4
3421480	3428760	It must be like from redone port of the first game or something. Uh peakman gets its wii upgrade this week as well
3428760	3432280	Or pickman peakman, whatever. Uh, maybe that's that biohazard zero
3432920	3440920	That might be with uh playstation 2 lego batman comes out this week. And uh, that's about it. Uh on the handhelds

3498760	3503000	Yeah, it's only in dallas. They don't give a crap about that stuff. Anyways, that's what pisses me off
3503000	3505000	Because i'm like totally excited to play it. They're like
3507000	3510760	Whatever. All right. Well, let's move on around the world with more releases. Um,
3510760	3512440	Two things for the uk

3518840	3520840	Is 100 classic book collection
3522200	3523240	Yeah
3523240	3528280	It's just not a big week in games. I I reckon not. All right. Well, there you have it
3528280	3533240	We have to do the release dates no matter what even if it's slow week and don't expect next week to be much better
3534200	3536200	Because it's not
3536200	3542520	But you know, it is uh, pretty big the text in banjo kazooie now because uh,
3542520	3545480	There's that brand new patch for those people that own the 14-inch
3546680	3548520	standard definition
3548520	3550520	You know tube tvs
3550840	3555560	You now can read your text in banjo kazooie and suffer through the dialogue of that game
3557320	3563880	So, um, well, thank heavens because you know, I was just waiting for the no, I actually I was just
3563880	3568680	you know, I was just waiting for the no, I actually a lot of people really were waiting for something like this to come out because
3568680	3575000	If you play it on the small tv, this game's next to impossible to play. I'm spoiled with my hd tv. So I need to just
3575720	3577720	Stop taunting those that don't have it
3578280	3583560	Correct. Yeah. All right. Yes. All right. Well, um, we're just about to the end of part a tonight
3583560	3586220	But hey, we've got to uh, take some time to recognize
3586220	3593180	Gaming's classics and that's what we do here in a segment. We call the classic game of the week
3593740	3600400	Oh dark sakura, what have you picked for this very special holiday week for the kids and uh adults out there to recognize?
3600700	3607820	This week in gaming i've picked a bit of the nes and uh, commodore 64 for you. Rob
3608460	3611260	Yay, joy in the form of maniac mansion
3611260	3613260	Maniac mansion
3615420	3618140	Maniac mansion is a weird little game
3622620	3624700	This music's from the nes version yeah
3627660	3632780	But it was originally on the commodore 64 so where um
3635580	3637900	It actually uh is the game that the uh
3637900	3643260	Scum engine was created for the script creation utility for maniac mansion
3643820	3650700	And lucas arts used it for about uh, 10 more years to keep playing it. It also um has chuck the plant in it
3651260	3656460	If anyone has looked at other lucas arts games that that character's in but anyway as the game goes, um
3657500	3660140	There was a purple meteor that made a big crater
3660380	3666060	um on the line of this big mansion that belonged to the edison family and um
3666060	3672620	So basically there were changes in the people that lived there and then uh people that were in uh
3673420	3674620	the
3674620	3681340	Hospital started disappearing. So then there were a bunch of people who uh decided to go into the house because
3681900	3687660	A local cheerleader turned up missing and they decided to go through the entire house, which is like this big
3688540	3690540	movie type horror
3690620	3692620	house thing with um
3692620	3695580	Tentacles and an evil genius and the pool
3696220	3703660	The pool is the best part it has different multi- it has you know multiple endings you can go through depends on who lives who dies
3704300	3710300	You can have a you know, a perfect ending you can have the adversary win you can have um
3711260	3715660	You can have them famous by publishing his autobiography. You can feed them to a plant
3715660	3721740	Um, and um, you can you know, get your players in the game killed and um,
3722620	3725820	it has different red herrings in it and um
3727660	3734140	Just kind of different weird stuff in the game. Um, the different characters in there is you have the sort of
3735180	3739020	James dean type character you have a new wave musician
3739820	3741820	You have a photographer
3741820	3749100	You have a novelist. Um, you have a big nerd who's uh, really scary. YAY NERD!
3750140	3752860	You've got um a punk rock girl
3753500	3758080	You've got um a surfer in there. They all have their different strengths and weaknesses
3758860	3760860	and um
3760860	3764780	I've played this of course on the nes because that's what I had. Um
3766860	3769900	The uh, the different versions there were there were there were
3769900	3773660	the uh, the different versions there were there was also a pc
3774460	3775900	that um
3775900	3777340	also, uh
3777340	3779340	played um
3779980	3784220	There's also the apple 2 the amiga and atari st versions
3784860	3790220	Um, there was the nes versions and instead of it being the full size. They were all kind of sd
3790940	3792940	Super deformed, you know the different characters
3793420	3795420	um
3795420	3802300	And there is actually um an enhanced version with updated graphics that's out and it had a sitcom based on the series
3802380	3806460	Do you ever remember watching? Oh, yeah, I remember that. Oh god, that wasn't on very long
3806540	3810300	But yeah, I remember there was this game was pretty big when it came out and there was a fan
3810700	3816860	Um remake that's called maniac mansion deluxe that runs on windows. Um, the has really
3817660	3824140	um enhanced graphics and music that was actually borrowed from day of the tentacle and um
3824140	3826540	it supposed to fix a lot of uh,
3827180	3833660	Bugs and inconsistencies and they put in some different changes to make it a little bit harder. It's also playable in day of the tentacle
3834540	3836540	maniac mansion
3836860	3843100	Um, and of course then there was it was really really centered though on the nes there were a lot of stuff changed
3843900	3845900	um
3846940	3850220	There um was only one printing of the game
3850940	3852780	um
3852780	3859020	They actually did forget to leave in though some of the more bloody parts like you could still microwave the hamster
3860540	3862460	awesome
3862460	3867740	But the pal version does not have the ability to microwave the hamster. Oh
3869420	3871420	The guy though who um
3871660	3873980	That ported it douglas, uh crockford
3874540	3879340	Put out a memoir that was called the expurgation of maniac mansion
3879340	3882780	Which was, you know, basically him going oh god nintendo you suck
3883900	3889900	um about how strict nintendo was for what they could allow in the game what they couldn't and um
3891660	3898780	About you know some things that he agreed with taking out like edna, you know having sexually themed threats to the characters
3899500	3901500	and different things, um
3902140	3906220	Including the you know, the use of violence non-violence and that type of thing
3906220	3908220	That type of thing
3908380	3910380	um
3910860	3913660	So, um, it was pretty pretty uh
3914620	3916860	Heavily centered like I said, um
3917740	3919500	also, um
3919500	3923580	There like I was saying before it was my favorite part of the game
3924220	3927820	Whenever I would just get really tired of playing it and go to hell with this
3928300	3932220	I would go to the pool drain it and push the red button so that the house would explode
3932220	3934220	I
3934860	3940300	Just what I did every time I was like i'm tired of playing explode game over
3943260	3947900	I didn't think the graphics on the nes version were that great compared to the computer one. No
3949580	3952540	Which is strange because i'm talking about a game on the commodore 64, but
3953660	3959260	The commodore 64 version was actually really nice. I personally did not play it, but I have seen it played
3959260	3962320	Um, because like I said, I didn't have a commodore 64
3963900	3968940	I had a clicko adam. I have to say though as far as this type of game goes on the nes
3969100	3972780	There is a game. I do prefer these point-and-click games shadow gate
3973500	3976060	Shadow gate was great. Yeah, i'm talking you know
3976060	3981420	You know what part I would always get those stuck at was where you went into the the portal and you had a limited time
3981900	3983020	with your um
3983020	3985260	You had to actually have like some item to make it through the portal
3985260	3990300	You're gonna need to do that in a future week. I'm gonna have to I actually never finished shadow gate, but I love shadow gate
3991180	3992460	but um
3992460	3996620	It's just interesting because you don't think about these point-and-click games a lot on the nes because they they you know
3996620	3998620	But there were some really good ones
3999580	4003740	But um, yeah this it's a really good one, you know also, uh
4004300	4008940	There's some of the uh, lucas arts, uh, i'm just looking at the list of the different lucas arts, uh
4009740	4013580	Um titles that they were supposed to go along with the scum engine
4013580	4018780	And let me get back to that because I was just on it. It was um, I think a couple of monkey island games
4019820	4021820	and uh labyrinth and loom
4022700	4029020	And I think i've covered loom before which is strange because I think loom came out before maniac mansion didn't it?
4029580	4031580	Uh, no, it was after no, no, it was after
4032140	4034780	Strange it was after monkey island even I think
4036780	4042460	But yeah, um some uh, and actually, uh, one of the salmon max games was supposed to use it, but they uh, canceled it
4042460	4044940	It was a salmon max freelance police
4045900	4048220	And full throttle payback was another one
4048860	4055920	But yeah, um some of the different ones that used it was uh, monkey island 2 lachuck's revenge and indiana jones and the fate of atlantis
4057420	4060460	So well there you have it
4061420	4065020	If there's nothing else to add then your classic game of the week is blow up the house
4066060	4068060	maniac mansion on the
4068060	4075260	Maniac mansion on the nes or commodore 64 whatever system you prefer maniac mansion
4075260	4077420	And don't forget to drain the water for the pool and blow up the house
4077900	4079900	That's dark soccer's favorite thing to do, correct?
4081000	4081980	Indeed
4081980	4082860	All right
4082860	4087500	Well, uh, we're going to take a quick break here on orange lounge radio and do some music here
4087900	4092860	And uh when we come back we have plenty more actually, sorry the podcast folks. You won't get to hear the music

4094940	4098620	But uh, we'll be back really soon with more of orange launch radio more stories
4098780	4103740	Hopefully a little bit happier than all the layoff stories we had in uh part a do you think we can arrange that low-key get?
4103740	4106700	Some happier stuff in part. Maybe tonight. All right, we'll try
4107100	4110140	Um, meanwhile, we're gonna go ahead and take a break and we will be right back
4115980	4121580	And welcome back to more of orange lounge radio and this part b of our podcast for this december the 21st
4121580	4126160	Of 2008 and uh, happy holidays to you guys out there listening to the program
4126720	4131440	Uh, we talked a lot about uh different things going on in part a unfortunately a lot of really not so happy
4131440	4133680	Holidays going on for a lot of folks in the game industry
4134240	4139040	And i'm ready to hear that. Uh, we talked also about some other um news including um,
4139600	4145920	Some sales stuff about uh, hg remix and some little big planet updates and some other news coming to the sony world
4145920	4152160	But now we're going to move in and start off tonight talking a little bit about microsoft in part b. Yes, logy. Yes, we are
4153120	4158980	Not exactly great news, but uh microsoft has announced that fable 2's expansion
4159680	4161680	Um, nahole island
4162160	4169140	Not coming out for christmas. Unfortunately, uh was due out this week. It is now being delayed to the end of january
4169140	4175080	Still going to be 10 bucks. Apparently they ran into some unexpected technical difficulties
4176420	4180020	At least they didn't call it balloon nahole island. I mean that would have been really bad
4181140	4183700	Just saying that would be horrible
4185620	4192100	It's why why the delay, um unexpected technical difficulties, whatever that's supposed to mean
4193700	4198260	Uh, everyone took some time off for the holidays. I still don't think it's a good name to name it nahole island
4198260	4200260	anyways, it just
4201220	4204980	Makes me think of like a glory hole or well, haven't you ever heard of what a balloon knot is?
4206020	4213300	That's supposed to be like an asshole because you know what a balloon knot looks like an asshole exactly and this one house in san diego
4215460	4222100	And every time I hear not whole island I keep thinking of a balloon knot hole and it's disgusting i'm like who wants to visit an island
4222820	4227140	With a bunch of assholes. There's a house in san diego that looks like a sphincter
4227140	4230260	Make all the gay jokes you want, but that does not sound appealing. I'm, sorry
4230980	4232980	So there you have it
4235060	4237060	Anyway
4239460	4244340	I'm sorry, i'll move on i'm trying to eat a bagel while i'm talking and making jokes. I need to stop eating cookies
4245700	4249140	Uh tiger claw says every time I hear not whole i'm thinking of sonic am
4251940	4253940	Uh moving on
4253940	4259720	Eight hundred point microsoft point cards now have made their way into the retail marketplace
4260340	4266500	um, apparently, um, you know, you could only get 1600 microsoft points before it was 1999, but now
4266820	4270440	You can get 800 microsoft point cards at retailers for 9.99
4271140	4275620	And hey, that would be one whole cent cheaper than buying them online. Oh, but you have to pay tax
4275860	4278740	So you're screwed then you have to consider this tax
4278740	4284900	So it's good if you don't like if you want to give a gift or if like, you know, you don't have a credit card
4284900	4286660	And you're a little kid
4286660	4288180	or
4288180	4291620	Or you want to buy it as a gift, but you know, it's it's a stocking stuffer
4291700	4294660	So maybe 20 bucks is too much. I don't know just buy it online
4295220	4300340	Yeah, I guess you know what I want, but they don't world peace. No not world peace screw world peace. Um,
4300340	4308100	But they're not available in most stores is those playstation network cards because I hate the playstation network and how they do their
4308420	4310900	Payments online. Yeah, it's a little silly. I don't like it by the way
4310900	4315940	speaking of playstation network because you brought it up and I forgot to mention earlier in the show we talked about playstation home last week
4315940	4319140	And I said I was going to get an olr club as soon as they open it up
4319380	4323940	Well, I guess I missed it because I went back online later in the week and I saw where you could buy a clubhouse online
4323940	4325220	It was just hard to find
4325220	4331300	Um, i'm not interested in it because you have to invite people into the club and you can only invite up to like 30 people
4331620	4333620	What kind of an olr club is that?
4334500	4338180	Not a cool one, unfortunately, I know we have more than 30 people in our chat room tonight
4338180	4340100	We probably would have more people now than what I do
4340100	4344420	I thought it was something that people would be able to search and go into you know at their leisure
4344420	4349940	But I don't see how it's promotion for the show to do that. It sounds stupid then I'd have to buy all the furniture
4350020	4351940	So forget it
4351940	4358180	Until home gets cooler. I protest. Sorry. Well, there are probably only about 30 of our listeners that actually have a playstation three
4358260	4360260	Yeah, true true
4361300	4365140	Sj100 matt in our chat room wants to point out. Um, I see psn cards in best buy
4365600	4369860	Entertainment says not only that clubs cost money fail. I was willing to like for five bucks
4370020	4376020	I would have done it like it's an experiment. How much was it five bucks five bucks? Okay. Yeah, and I'm still considering it
4376020	4382180	Here right now. It's five bucks with no re no reoccurring fee, but sony is going to implement them at some point
4383060	4386100	You just didn't say what like home doesn't suck enough
4386580	4391140	Do now do we have the trophy rooms and stuff like remember how they're saying? No, nope
4392020	4397300	So like most things it's extremely early like most sony will get i'm sure home will be better in a year
4397380	4403220	But by then we will have all forgot home is extremely late as it is. It's no time for being early. It's late
4403220	4405220	It's
4405300	4412580	Just saying I know all right, sorry we can go back to um, um other stuff now, sorry jamie, okay
4413460	4415460	sega
4415540	4419780	What about them? Well, it looks like um, there's been some esrb, uh
4420820	4427860	Ratings put out so that means that they're going to be a number of games on um xbox live and playstation network from sega
4428420	4431620	There will be um, a sonic 3 comic zone
4431620	4434900	fantasy star 2 and gun star heroes, whoo-hoo
4436020	4438260	which are uh supposed to be uh
4439300	4442580	Out and then um, there were I guess other releases. Um
4443700	4450260	I'm, sorry, uh, the previous releases were sonic the hedgehog sonic 2 golden axe and echo the dolphin and streets of rage 2
4451060	4457860	Wait a minute, but isn't sega putting out that thing of like 40 games for like 20 bucks or something. Yes
4457860	4462420	Yes, do you think that sega wants as much money as possible? Yes, okay
4463460	4465860	Say yeah, are they giving me anything special?
4466820	4468340	with this
4468340	4473860	I guess and they're going to give you the option to blur it out so that it looks all like, you know hd like
4474180	4477960	Seems kind of just buy the 20 thing when it comes out. Seriously
4479140	4481140	Unless they're not i'm, sorry
4483140	4485780	Which I highly doubt that they are all right, we'll see what happens
4485780	4489540	Something else coming to xbox live arcade kind of interesting
4490740	4495800	I'm, not sure a lot of people are familiar with the um, mmorpg dofus
4497380	4499380	They have a uh
4499380	4506820	Game, I think it's called uh wok fu and now the islands of wok fu are going to be coming to xbox live arcade
4506820	4508820	So it's like an mmo
4508820	4515140	But not you know, it's got the mmo graphics. I guess the perfect example would be like ragnarok online ds
4515140	4520100	You know where it's not technically an mmo game, but you play it similar to the mmo
4520100	4525300	It's just you're not going to be interacting with other people. In fact, that's the tagline. It's like an mmo, but not
4528020	4533700	But um, yeah, it's apparently set a hundred years or a thousand years after wok fu it's due
4534260	4537940	Uh late 2009 and will be an adventure beat them up title
4537940	4544580	As an adventure beat them up and venture beat them up as adventure slash beat them up all style game
4545540	4553540	It says it can be played in a two-player team mode and uh will reveal never before seen background content from the world of dofus
4554100	4556100	and wok fu
4556740	4562740	Really because to me the entire world of dofus and wok fu are unseen and I have not played either one
4562740	4568180	But hey, it's a different type of game and that's always welcome bochi kawa in chat asks wok fu
4568180	4570340	Is that like beating people senseless with a frying pan?
4572020	4575060	Yes, it is exactly now that would be a great game
4575860	4579700	Go around and hit people with a frying pan. Actually, you can kind of do that little big planet. I just want to say
4580260	4582260	uh, hey talking about um
4582260	4588020	Hey other things we might want to hit in the head with a frying pan is uh, whoever caused those xbox 360 discs to scratch
4588020	4593620	Apparently there's some lawsuits going on right now. You know, we reported on those a while ago, but now they're just finally getting around to you know
4593620	4599700	Being looked at investigated what have you and a document in one of the suits was actually unsealed last week
4600100	4605300	Apparently my and what it contains in it is that microsoft actually knew about the problem prior to launch
4605460	4609620	They have multiple options to fix it and the company rejected all of them
4610420	4614020	There were three options apparently listed in the document one of them was a
4614020	4620100	To increase the magnetic field of the disc holder and the reason why they decided to reject that is because it would get in the way
4620100	4625060	Of the disc opening and closing thing. Um, but here's here's where I go crazy when I read that
4625780	4629300	My 360 is having issues when I try to open and close the door on it right now
4629300	4634260	Like sometimes i'll have to hit the button multiple times and i'm starting to worry that the damn thing's about to break on me
4634260	4636260	Have you heard of anything like that loki?
4636660	4638820	no, but I know that the way they have the
4638820	4645620	Eject button and also the um, like power switch and stuff. It's really funky like the power switch
4645620	4649700	There's a little button that's off center on it. So if you push it in the center of your
4650260	4654580	Face plate it won't exactly trigger it every time you kind of push to the right of it
4655540	4659300	So and the way the eject button works is kind of similar
4659300	4664340	It's a little push button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out, but it's kind of like a push button switch
4664340	4669700	It's kind of like a push button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out, but you know
4669780	4676100	You can always if you can't get it to eject that way just you know, hit the middle button and select eject disc
4677620	4681700	Great jrod in chat says I used to have to do that and it ended up where the disk drive wouldn't read anymore
4682340	4683700	lovely
4683700	4688420	Um, remember they won't warranty unless it read rings. So that's when you take a blow torch to it
4689460	4690980	Well, look, there's some other options too
4690980	4696580	The other options were to slow down the disc rotation speed but that was rejected because it would have slowed down the game loading times
4696660	4698260	I think we can understand that one
4698260	4703940	uh, and then um, apparently the other option was to install little bumpers that would have cost the company between
4704240	4710260	35 to 75 million additional dollars, but I would think little bumpers wouldn't that be like maybe like a buck?
4711220	4712500	a machine
4712500	4715220	Yes, it's it's literally that little um
4715940	4720100	They had a fix a long time ago when people were ready to scratch thing that was available online
4720100	4722100	You'd buy these little um
4722100	4726660	It looked like a cd and you would put it in the drive and kind of push it up and it would stick little
4727140	4733060	Pads on there that would you know keep the disc from jiggling because basically what happens is since the disc has so much play
4733140	4739300	Inside the drive it'll end up, you know bending back to where it rubs up against the laser and that's what carves a nice little
4740260	4742260	You know circle into your disc
4742420	4746660	So this what these do is allows it so that the other side
4746660	4750260	Doesn't tip as much so doesn't ever make contact with the laser
4751300	4757380	Well, here's the thing is that um the and the big thing that the document shows is that microsoft what they eventually decided to do
4757780	4761860	They appended the manual with a warning and offered a disc replacement program
4762180	4766900	You know that was their big fix and I believe something about like a sticker on the door too that you have to pull off
4766900	4768900	That warns them not to tilt the machine when you play
4770020	4774340	Apparently this was deemed insufficient by company employees via an internal email
4774340	4777860	But it's apparently what happened. Anyway, well, it is kind of I mean
4779300	4786900	It's a stupid fix and really they should have just added those little bumpers to it because it wouldn't have cost them 75 million dollars
4786980	4792980	I mean how many consoles they have out there? They have like almost fifteen thousand, you know, fifteen million consoles or not
4792980	4796180	Even really that many but like over ten million consoles. Okay, so
4796980	4801700	You know, they're saying seventy five million dollars. So that's seven fifty per console
4801700	4805860	Um, or no, that's 75 million. That'd be 75 cents per console, basically
4806900	4808900	so
4809780	4813700	Or no my math's all wrong today. Well act whatever it doesn't matter either way
4813700	4818820	It's not gonna cost that much act up in chat says but who the fuck moves around a console when playing a game really?
4820180	4825620	Well, some people own pets like my cat who likes to jump on consoles and um,
4826020	4827780	You know, she may knock it over luckily
4827780	4833380	I'm smart enough to know if the cat's nearby the console. I will lay it flat on the ground instead of you know
4833380	4836340	Tipping up and that's you know, that's a rare occasion, you know, or
4837220	4841220	We just took ours away where she can't get to it. Yeah, I mean it's someone can bump it
4841220	4846260	You know a court get pulled or something knock the console over. I mean, there's all sorts of stuff that can happen
4846260	4851540	It's rare, but there are cases though. I've been hearing where people's discs are just getting in a groove
4852100	4854420	Carved into it just from leaving it
4854420	4859380	Going it's just on you know, the way the laser moves or something that there's some
4860100	4864660	Jittering in there that causes like a ring to kind of carved in over time
4865220	4869700	Not necessarily like where people were tilting the console. It made a nice little like grinding noise
4870100	4873780	Uh, gs68 says microsoft needs to fix the d-pad from hell agreed
4874180	4880740	It's getting to the point where i'm actually considering buying like some games on the ps3 over the xbox 360 completely based on the controller
4881620	4883620	completely based on the controller
4883620	4889460	Completely based on the controller whatever happened to that controller that was supposedly coming out that had a better d-pad
4889700	4893960	I never saw that and why they would do that for a limited amount of time is retarded
4894420	4900180	That's a very good question. I I have no idea why they would do that. Uh, and tiger claw wants to say, um,
4901060	4901940	Well, he says a couple things
4901940	4906180	He says it's a conspiracy microsoft knew all along with the disk scratch problem before the public found out
4906420	4909300	I smell a class action waiting to happen. Actually. It's already happening
4909300	4914100	That's where these documents came out of but then he goes on to say microsoft needs to fix the tray eject problem
4914180	4916740	A lot of people are experiencing it. I'm not the only one
4917300	4921300	And bobby blackwolf wanted to work in a cheap plug for his upcoming new show
4921620	4927540	He said the first episode of friday night gaming will address that issue directly on stage with a company that repairs consoles
4927620	4931780	Apparently one little shtick they're going to do on their show is actually repair consoles live on air
4932340	4936340	On his little friday night show he's starting I believe the 9th of january is the first episode
4936340	4940660	Straight out straight out of atlanta or I have a console that's under repairables
4941140	4946180	What because i've tried repairing it really remember that should be a challenge that I took a heat gun to you
4946180	4953380	Should see if bobby will take it on bobby and his friends. It can be fixed. I'm sure if they re-bulb the um GPU on it, but
4954500	4959700	I don't have the device to do it. Let alone the patience or the skill necessary
4960100	4963780	It's gonna be like trauma center for consoles. That's gonna be amazing
4963780	4965780	So check that out
4965780	4967780	friday night
4967780	4971780	Fnglive.net if I don't say the website then bobby will say I hate him. All right
4973780	4977780	Let's move on with more news. We'll see what happens in further developments with the uh disc scratching
4977780	4980780	Oh, hey, no, we're not gonna move on with more news
4981780	4985780	We don't want to do any more news. We're done. We're out of here. Have a great night everybody. Bye. All right
4985780	4987780	No, just kidding. Uh, we're gonna open your emails now. That's what we're doing
4987780	4993780	Uh, we're gonna open your emails now. That's what we're doing mailbag at orange lounge radio.com
4994180	4998580	And dark soccer likes to read some of her favorite emails. Actually. She doesn't really like to do it
4998580	5000580	She does it because she has to yep
5002180	5006420	If we tell her that if she does not read the emails on air that she will not be given beer anymore
5007460	5010100	So mailbag orange lunch radio.com. Let's read some of those emails
5010980	5013300	Um, hey, olr. This is amay satsuma
5013300	5018420	My question to you is if you were able to throw an object at someone what would that object be?
5018580	5020820	And who would you throw it at must be non-lethal?
5021700	5025140	Does this have something to do with the bush shoe thing this week it must
5026340	5028340	Um, I actually would
5028580	5032100	If I could completely get away with it without you know
5032660	5037460	Um the secret service trying to jump me or anything. I would throw something at bush
5038340	5040340	um, I would throw um
5040340	5042680	um, basically the uh
5045320	5047320	Waste of a homeless person at him
5048760	5054680	Feces no overall waste. Oh, okay. Yeah and say that it was his fault
5056520	5060440	Um, but that's that's hypothetical that's not not that I would physically do that
5061000	5065400	So i'm not breaking any sort of constitutional law by saying it would be cool if that were to happen
5065400	5072840	But um, can I answer can I answer go for it, um that crazy messed up, uh, uh,
5073160	5079320	Fags go to hell guy. What's that guy phelps phelps? Yes. I would like to throw a cream pie at him
5079560	5081560	But what a waste of a yummy pie
5081800	5085560	So I will throw um throw rainbow sparkles feces pie
5087240	5089240	Here's some shit cake

5207360	5210800	But that may not be done by media molecule, but I think sony will cash in on it
5210960	5214240	Um, if it's not done by media molecule, i'm already worried. Um
5214960	5219680	As far as the other games in 2009 god, what's coming out on psp in 2009? There's not a lot right now, right?
5219840	5221040	No, there is

5222400	5228480	Tell me some of the titles. I have to look forward to star ocean second. Um, we're the second star ocean games coming out

5249360	5253200	So i'm gonna know where's africa ps3? That's true. Wasn't it supposed to be out by now?
5253360	5255520	Yeah, they're picking up a national geographic license
5255520	5259920	I was this close to importing it and I was like fuck that I can't run over the animals
5260240	5264880	So I said no i'm not buying that uh, dissida when it comes out in english
5264960	5271680	Yes, dissida will be coming out over here in the summer. Okay. God. I can't wait to play that. Um
5273760	5279520	I don't know. It looks like a better year definitely because 2008 sucked and like you look at the releases
5279760	5283120	There was just not a lot of releases period I mean there were some good ones
5283120	5289760	I mean the midnight club la remix is supposed to be pretty good. Um, you know star ocean. The first one was pretty good
5290400	5297680	I could go for some more of the final fantasy. Um ports to uh, the psp. That would be awesome. Like, uh, you know, maybe
5298880	5300240	six
5300240	5305440	Six would be nice. Did we get all the did we get all the questions in that email? I think we did. Oh, I zoned out
5305520	5306640	Sorry
5306640	5308640	Um, yeah, we did. All right
5309040	5310400	um
5310400	5313040	Moving on to the next email
5313840	5319600	Um, I just thought I would update you folks as to what's going on regarding the situation with my stolen
5320160	5322900	P uh ps3 this is from spazzinator
5323840	5324320	Oh, yes
5324320	5327040	He called in uh last week or the week before to mention it
5327040	5331360	It got stolen and he wanted us to kind of put out the word for all our fans in buffalo
5331360	5333360	Of which I don't know how many we have but we tried
5333920	5337120	To date the buffalo police have not done anything about it and let's face it
5337120	5342720	Unless the ps3 was jelly filled or covered in sprinkles. They aren't likely to look for it. Frankly. I have no faith in them
5343600	5348480	My counseling agency has been has been helpful as a wet fart read. Not at all
5348880	5354160	You'd think that since the theft occurred there that they'd be eager to have this issue resolved just to cover their collective asses
5354560	5356000	but it looks like
5356000	5358000	that isn't the case as
5359280	5362080	Oh, I lost my place actually as a related note
5362080	5367920	And if I neither mentioned it in the call, or you haven't figured it out already. I bought my ps
5368480	5374420	I brought my ps3 to my counseling agency for an informal party. I was supplying the entertainment movies downloaded on psn
5375020	5377840	karaoke rock band guitar hero world tour style
5378320	5385600	Etc. It was stolen between 12 15 p.m. And 1 15. Um p.m. Est. Wouldn't that be am
5385600	5392800	Um, oh no, i'm misreading it on uh est on 11 19 when it was unattended in all likelihood
5392880	5395280	I won't be getting my original system back, which is a shame
5395600	5402080	I had the 60 gigabyte model which are impossible to find not only that but I upgraded the internal. Um htd
5402960	5410800	And bought a ton of stuff off of the psn store anywho luckily my ssi payee is sitting on my rainy day fund
5410800	5416560	And sent her request for the adequate funds to replace the system with a used 80 gigabyte model
5416960	5422720	And the same type of upgraded hdd that I had before i'll worry about the movies and tv shows that I bought at a later
5422800	5429120	Time and date. Sorry for the long as hell email. Trust me. It's not and I figured that you'd appreciate an update. Take care
5430240	5436000	Well, thanks for letting us know well stolen systems suck and whoever stole your system needs to die in a fire and let's just hope
5436000	5438800	That karma comes around and bites this person in their big fat ass
5438800	5441440	Next email next email j-rod
5442240	5443360	Hey folks
5443360	5448260	I haven't heard the last show but I don't know if this has been asked if it has please disregard
5448560	5453680	But if you could ask santa for one gaming related christmas present and don't worry about price santa is bringing it
5454400	5459280	What would it be mine would be a new computer to play left for dead because I can't even run the original halo

5464880	5466880	you first
5466880	5471040	Um, I don't know if it's gaming related, but I would like a new computer
5471600	5476320	Well, see I have a new computer for the gaming but I would just like a whole new like setup for the show
5476560	5478560	I'd like like a fancy new mix board
5478880	5483520	Um an easier way to publish a show on a faster computer without having to transfer to my new one
5483520	5488320	Which has kind of been slowing things down technically gaming related. Um, I technically because it has to do with the show
5488880	5494320	So that would be my thing. I'd want a fancy like I want a state-of-the-art computer recording studio
5494320	5496320	That's what I want. Yeah
5497200	5500160	Matt I want a ddrx machine

5542080	5544980	Can you believe that dan actually asked me if I would trade it temporarily?
5545920	5549200	Okay, i'm gonna go I can't go on a completely like random tangent for a minute for it
5549200	5553680	Okay, here's the thing it is related though. Um, I on twitter
5553680	5559200	I follow some other podcasters some other indie podcasters and one of the podcasters I follow is one of the guys from video game outsiders
5559600	5562960	And he posted a youtube today. I guess he picked up some new. Um
5563680	5569360	Popeye machine or something. I guess what he does. He has like like how you amass a bunch of pinball machines in your house
5569440	5571680	He amasses a bunch of 80s, uh stuff in his basement
5573360	5575360	Not a bunch of babies
5575360	5578880	Hey, I found this baby at the mall
5579680	5584480	No, i'm gonna take it home and raise it to do my work. No, you stop trying to start a podcast war
5584560	5586560	I could just see it now dude the guy
5586640	5591760	I can see they're gonna read an email on the show the guys from olr said you have babies in your basement
5593280	5595680	What do you have to say about that they're crunchy
5598000	5602640	No, no, no, but he's got like all these old school 80s machines I was like, oh cool cool and like, um,
5602640	5606160	you know, I was I was looking at the pop I wanted but I went to his youtube channel because I was like
5606160	5609840	I wonder if he shows off other stuff like this and he does and one of the youtubes that he had
5610240	5613040	Was him getting his new baby pac-man machine
5613520	5620320	And I have to admit it's the first time i've ever really watched something like that another podcaster did where I was completely
5621020	5625600	Overcome with jealousy like just total jealousy. I was looking at it going
5626160	5631120	That is so cool. I am so fucking jealous. I want I want one of those fuckers so badly
5631120	5633520	Even the baby pac-man sort of sucks ass
5634480	5642420	It does novelty. It's it's the novelty of the only successful incarnation of video and pinball has been pinball 2000
5643920	5644960	Really?
5644960	5646960	So there you go
5647040	5650720	God now they're gonna get I can just see it now who said you keep babies in your basement
5650720	5653860	No, it's baby pac-man that he had in his basement that I was completely
5654560	5657120	And utterly overcome with jealousy. Yeah babies
5657120	5661040	I mean if I could find one of those machines cheap, you know, I would put that shit in this garage
5661120	5666640	You wouldn't find one cheap. Good luck unless it's completely destroyed and gutted. I know last email dan
5667120	5671600	Come fix my baby pac-man because I don't know dick about pinball games
5672880	5677440	Last email. Okay. Hey, olr. It's from cheeseburger, by the way
5678320	5681200	Well me being the huge star crash fan as I am
5681760	5685920	I never started playing world of warcraft because I would become addicted
5685920	5689600	Well yesterday I went to my friend's house and he started a free trial of wow
5690000	5693700	He had 256 megabytes of ram out of the two gigabytes recommended
5694080	5698480	So I started a trial on my laptop because it has one gigabyte of ram so he could play
5699040	5701040	Without much lag while I was there
5701440	5706800	Well, I got home and started playing for a few hours. So my question is for sky what server or whatever it is
5706960	5712400	You it's called do you play on I play on the garithos. Did I spell that right?
5712400	5718160	Right server i'm level nine and I wanted to know if it's worth buying and if I can switch server to play on with you
5718560	5722240	Also, tell me a little about the game and some of the things that will convince me to buy it
5723920	5724960	I'm going to give you an answer
5724960	5730800	You weren't expecting because if I remember right cheeseburgers like 15 years old 14 15 like he's a younger listener of ours
5731040	5733200	My advice to you is not to buy world of warcraft
5733760	5738960	Because you're still in school and if you get sucked into a game like world of warcraft, um, it could affect your school
5738960	5742880	Here's the thing if you know in your heart and in your gut in your mind
5743040	5746400	You can restrict yourself to playing this game one or two hours a day tops
5747040	5749760	Then it might be okay, but honestly, it's the social element
5750000	5751520	That's what really these games are all about
5751520	5755520	I mean I could describe all about like the quest and the classes and the magic and all this stuff
5755520	5758000	But you know what? You're playing the game. You see all that firsthand
5758320	5761760	The reason why people get addicted to this stuff is the social element. It's logging
5761920	5767360	It's it's you know, when I log on to the game and I say hello to the guild everybody goes rob, you know
5767360	5772240	It's like walking into cheers the bar and everybody yells norm. It's it's that kind of thing
5772400	5776880	That's that's the reward that you're going to get out of a game like warcraft. Um that being said
5777600	5780880	I play on the server raven crest and if you want more information, it's all in our forms
5782400	5784320	That's a cheap plug for the forms
5784320	5787280	And that way people who only really really want it will get it
5787600	5790960	But yeah, it's kind of I know i'm like such an addict of the game. But you know
5791600	5793600	Uh, i'm also not in school
5793600	5796640	And uh, sometimes even I have to really limit myself on how much i'll play
5796640	5799440	Yeah, that's actually sort of a reason why I have I really
5800080	5802480	Am loath to get back into world of warcraft myself
5802880	5807760	It's because I know how little time i'll have to play except like maybe on a weekend and then when you're still enjoying
5807840	5812320	Ragnarok the thing that sucks too is that if you get far behind the rest of your guild you start to feel like
5812560	5814560	You're just out of it. You know what I mean?
5814640	5817840	So that's you know, the competition's a lot. So
5818880	5820880	There you go. That's that's my honest advice
5822240	5824240	Ta-da, so that was it for emails
5824240	5830560	I said that didn't I? All right. Sorry. Well, I wasn't listening surprised gee rob. All right. I don't listen to this show
5830560	5832560	I just talk on it
5832560	5836740	All right. That's it for emails. If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange launch radio.com
5837040	5840240	We'll get some more stuff from you later during the skype line
5841360	5844400	Even though I don't know how long we can go tonight because it's fucking freezing out here in the garage
5844400	5849040	But we will get some more stories first. It's not as cold as it was last week. It's still pretty fucking cold
5849040	5856000	It's still pretty fucking cold. I love this quilt. Oh, it's so cold. All right, uh logi, um, there's rumors that
5856880	5858000	the uh
5858000	5864720	PSP is getting another revision. Uh, the PSP 4000 is apparently due out late 09
5864720	5868480	This is coming to us from Eurogamer that reports their publishing sources
5869040	5873360	Indicate that uh Sony is planning on doing this and eventually will launch a PSP 2
5873360	5879360	I mean, I think it's a no-brainer that they're eventually going to launch some sort of portable gaming system later on, you know
5879840	5881840	Update the hardware that kind of makes sense
5882240	5886000	um, and it wouldn't you know be a surprise if they
5886800	5888880	Fix some more stuff on the PSP again
5889600	5893440	But of course Sony is saying they have no plans for a PSP 2
5894880	5897600	Where have I heard we have no plans for something before?
5897600	5904720	Oh, I know on every other rumor that they have no plans on like no plans for a pice cut no plans on releasing a 160
5904720	5910640	Gigabyte system no plans for doing something that it's completely obvious no plans to release a good system
5912000	5915120	We have no plans on ever becoming the number one console
5916320	5917840	again
5917840	5919840	So when you hear no plans
5920560	5924160	Hear them saying it's like we are, you know, so
5925280	5926800	yeah, just
5926800	5930640	Big deal. We know hardware revisions coming. Not a big surprise
5931680	5934880	A sequel to a popular handheld system might happen you think?
5935520	5937760	Hello. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought
5938560	5942080	Hey, uh moving on over to Nintendo who has been number one lately
5942080	5946080	Although amongst the hardcore gamers, uh, some of us are starting to feel a little jaded
5946400	5951840	I don't know. This is something that some hardcore gamers will be into but probably more for the casual crowd and the young folks
5951840	5959380	Um, some of the early 2009 releases for Nintendo, of course headlined by Pokemon Platinum on March 22nd
5960000	5964480	That is going to be a pretty big title on the Nintendo DS even though isn't it just the last two Pokemon?
5964640	5966640	It's it's just like they do this all the time
5966640	5971520	They release, you know, like, you know red and blue and then there's yellow that has something special, you know
5971520	5974800	It's it's it's just I think there's supposed to be new pokemons in this one
5974800	5981440	All right, then again and it also has some weird like uh level structures and stuff. It's like kind of neat looking interesting
5982480	5988480	Um some other games that are coming out, uh Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echo of Time is supposed to actually come out this spring
5988560	5994080	So we'll see what happens with that. Um, let's see. What else is supposed to come out here? I've got like a whole list
5994720	5996720	um
5996720	6002720	That is spring that they said that game would come out March. Yeah, probably the later the better, um
6002720	6005040	For them not drag quest five
6006960	6008720	Is that on
6008720	6012640	That's on DS. No, I don't see it listed in their list not in the first three months of the year
6013040	6016720	Oh really be a little later. No, unless it hasn't been announced yet. I don't know
6017520	6018480	I'm trying to look at some first part
6018480	6022080	Let's see Sega's putting out the house of the dead overkill on Wii in February
6022400	6025120	Sonic and the black knight in March and mad world in March
6026080	6030560	Ubisoft's got Tenchu in February and broken sword shadows the Templars in March
6030560	6036880	Nintendo, first party games, the only stuff they're putting out Mario power tennis in March and Pikmin in March
6036880	6038960	That's it on the Wii. Yeah on the Wii
6039840	6044480	However on the DS from Nintendo personal trainer math on January 12th

6080320	6082640	For the Nintendo DS. Did you see what they named those?
6082640	6086640	You remember the play on the Wii games new play control
6087200	6088240	Yeah
6088240	6092800	That's a retarded name. Just call it like I don't know cash cow Pikmin
6093920	6098240	I do want to point out Konami is putting out a game on the Wii that some of you guys might care about ddr

6099920	6102640	For those that are still playing ddr after all these years. There you go
6104880	6110320	Ssh 100 matt in chat says factor 5 goes down, but sonic team is still around. Where's the justice?

6113600	6116480	That's that for first quarter lineup
6117600	6121920	Well, how about something very cool for all of our?
6122560	6126960	8-bit fans which by the way, thank you for the old school Nintendo entertainment system dar
6126960	6131760	Sakura's kind of like a second Christmas gift slash late birthday gift. Well also thanks sauce for
6132320	6137360	Thank you sauce to the trade for agreeing to a trade that I got the better end of the deal of
6137360	6146000	Well, um, if anyone who is a big Nintendo fan, this is especially cool. Also, it's really cool for the fans of pac-man champion
6146400	6149680	Edition, it's been remade for the Nintendo entertainment system
6150800	6156960	It actually is fully functional actually just like the same. It looks pretty damn cool
6158000	6161920	Looking at a video here on this site. Sorry. That's what you're hearing in the background
6161920	6165920	I'm looking at a video here on this site. Sorry. That's what you're hearing in the background
6174400	6176400	Interesting looking
6177360	6181200	I don't know. It seems like it's a hacked ROM of some sort because the music in the background is strange
6181920	6186000	Right, it doesn't sound like pac-man at all. Anyway, there you go. That's that's what it sounds like
6186000	6193120	It might be trying to emulate the music from hmm, maybe well at any rate. Um, you um
6194240	6200560	There's no idea where you can find the ROM. It's from the pac-mania soundtrack. Oh, is it? Oh
6201520	6205600	Sorry, if that was loud guys, it wasn't loud to us in the studio, but I guess it came out very loud over the um,
6206240	6210800	But hey whoever whoever finds it then let me know what you think of it. So cool
6210800	6216080	Yeah, apparently the weird thing about this is that it's it's still unknown if this is like real or a concept thing
6216080	6218800	Because no ROM has showed up out there
6220560	6221680	Who knows
6221680	6226660	That's the weird thing about it. Is it like it's not something you can actually like download for use in an emulator
6227200	6230000	But they say it's an actual 8-bit nintendo game
6230560	6232480	I don't know
6232480	6239920	Um a game that is coming out on the ds, uh grand theft auto chinatown wars has been dated now for um march
6239920	6245300	Which is weird because I thought it was dated before for january, but either way it's coming out now march 17th
6245840	6249440	grand theft auto chinatown wars and uh will feature
6250080	6251680	most of liberty city
6251680	6252240	um
6252240	6257840	I think they're cutting out all their need from um grand theft auto 4 but most of it and it's going to kind of look
6257920	6259920	a little bit like um
6260000	6263600	The old grand theft auto 1 and 2 games, you know kind of a top-down 3d
6264640	6266640	Type of game and it's all cel-shaded
6267280	6269280	but still violent and
6269280	6271280	pretty cool looking
6271760	6273600	Yay, cool looking things
6273600	6276240	Europe will be getting the game three days later on march 20th
6276880	6279680	Well, that's good that it's not getting delayed so bad. Yeah
6280400	6283120	And I can't wait to try the online multiplayer. That'd be fun
6284000	6287280	Of course tons of people be cheating in it because they can i'm sure
6289280	6293920	Okay, so, um, here's something interesting going on I don't I don't know what the hell you want to call this
6294000	6296800	But I don't know if you've heard about this project. It's called bob's game
6296800	6301920	And it's this guy who's spent a lot a lot of time making a particular ds home brew project
6302320	6304000	He's apparently going on protests
6304000	6311440	He's going to be spending 100 days locked in his room locked and barricaded from the outside to protest how nintendo has been treating his project
6313120	6318480	Here's the thing he needs a ds software development kit to get his game which is um
6319120	6322800	I guess what bob made is some type of like 2d adventure thing. It looks really cool
6322800	6326720	He actually wants to sell it as a retail game, but nintendo will not give him one
6326800	6332320	Even though bob has apparently talked to nintendo done the application told he was going to get an answer in a few months
6332640	6336960	And apparently 17 weeks have come by no answer. No kid has showed up
6337120	6342800	However, now what he's going to be planning is his 100 day sit down protest. So he's doing a tantrum
6343340	6345920	Basically, he's throwing a fit fucking grow up
6346160	6350640	Well, he's been giving the run around with you know stuff and his game does look really cool
6350640	6352560	Um, that's kind of too bad, you know
6352560	6358640	Unfortunately, i'd be hitting up other publishers or whatever and see if they can publish your game or there's more. I gotta read all this
6358720	6363200	Um, apparently he met with nintendo in february about a year ago to ask for the kit
6363440	6367520	He teleconferenced he flew to game developers conference and had a face-to-face meeting
6367760	6371040	Uh, he talked to the wario world division who sent him to marketing
6371280	6374160	He talked to marketing and they sent him back to the wario world division
6374560	6379040	Uh on the application it said it would be six to eight weeks for a decision. It's been 17
6379040	6381040	He says he's met all the requirements
6381040	6388080	He's a financially stable registered company with an fein which I believe is a federal identification number. I'm working from a commercial address
6388720	6393440	Um, and he says that when nintendo decides to approve the developer license, he will end his protest
6393520	6397440	Apparently you can actually watch on live webcam. I'm actually going to go to the site right now
6398000	6403680	It looks like he's asleep, but you can see something on the board right now says reggie on the monitor there and uh,
6404320	6405360	it is
6405360	6410640	Yep, it's actually his live confinement right now, but it looks like he's fast asleep or something or he left the room
6410960	6412960	But he's on day 12
6413360	6418000	He's not supposed to leave the room. He's not it says he sleeps behind the camera. Oh
6419520	6423200	Where's his potty i'm assuming I hope that's all behind the camera too or something
6423520	6428000	But anyway, um, he says he cannot leave the room the door is locked and barricaded from the outside
6428320	6433040	He's sleeping behind the camera. Yes. There is a shower food is being delivered once a week by a friend
6433040	6437440	There is no internet access television or game consoles besides the ones he's developing on
6438480	6442880	He can receive and send email on his cell phone so he can get nintendo's reply and update the site
6443200	6448240	And the led counter will be incremented once a day. Sometimes it will display hints and secret messages
6451040	6453040	So, yes jamie he's throwing a tantrum
6453040	6461040	Is doing the equivalent of sticking his fingers in the in his ears and closing his eyes going lala
6463840	6469760	Well still though what about the point that he's meeting all of nintendo's requirements and nintendo's dicking him
6470400	6474720	What what about that to play devil's advocate? We need more imagine games
6474800	6480720	We don't have time with this good adventure crap need more imagine and more pets if it's got imagine and pets in it
6480720	6486120	we can definitely do something with it. Oh, and if it's a sim. More sim games.
6486120	6490200	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, you need to get an interview with this guy. I don't know if I can. He has
6490200	6494900	no phone, right? I can't, oh no, he has a cell phone. Maybe I can. I guess I could try
6494900	6501880	sending an email. I don't know. Misty in chat says, there's better ways to bitch about it.
6501880	6510200	Like not eating. Fasting. Like sending duty to Reggie. Hunger strike? Yes, a hunger strike.
6510200	6513840	That's what I was looking for. I am not on a hunger strike. I was shoving my mouth full
6513840	6525800	of food. I'm on a food strike where I do nothing but eat food. That's my response. All right.
6525800	6532560	Redertainment says, imagine Bob's pet sims adventure. Amazing. All right, so good luck
6532560	6542320	Bob on your protest, I guess. Um, don't die. Geez. Just kind of fucking ridiculous. And
6542320	6552200	by kinda, I mean really. Well, this is very, very happy, happy news for me. Because I have
6552200	6558200	been wanting this game, and I played the other two, and it's freaking beautiful. But Klonoa
6558200	6564400	Door to Phantom Isle is going to be coming out in North America. And that makes me giddy.
6564400	6572480	And it's supposed to be out in Spring 2009. And it's supposed to be keeping the original
6572480	6577040	design because everybody said they wanted it. And the North American version will have
6577040	6583480	some gesture controls. Basic control though is be triggered to grab your enemies and flick
6583480	6590360	the Wiimote to throw. Which is kinda cool. Um, it has an NES style Wiimote using the
6590360	6597160	GameCube controller. And the classic controller is also, uh, you can use that too. And, uh,
6597160	6606080	there is a rumor that the Klonoa 2 remake is on its way. Klonoa 2 is freaking hard.
6606080	6611360	But I really, really, really, really, really love Klonoa.
6611360	6615160	Maybe this took so long to come out in the US because the Klonoa developers locked themselves
6615160	6621840	in a room for 100 days until Nintendo agreed to put out their game.
6621840	6622840	Just sayin'.
6622840	6633280	Hmm. Well, um, you know, after much begging and pleading, apparently EA has decided to
6633280	6641200	graciously allow players to be able to reinstall their copies of Spore after uninstalling it.
6641200	6646560	They can now download a tool from EA that will let you deauthorize your PC and effectively
6646560	6653080	allow you to override the game's install-on-five-PCs limit, as you can manage the availability
6653080	6655160	of all five machine slots.
6655160	6665280	Hooray. But unfortunately there's not a tool that's gotten me back interested in Spore
6665280	6671600	again, to which actually my cat knocked a disk on the floor in its case, and I was like,
6671600	6672600	eh, it's a good place for it.
6672600	6679920	Nice. So do you let the cat rearrange all your furniture?
6679920	6684720	She does that on her own. She decides that she wants to cram herself in the tiny space
6684720	6691400	that is between my monitor on the shelf and the top of my desk. It's, like, less than,
6691400	6695880	you know, about six inches tall, but somehow she decides that she wants to cram herself
6695880	6696880	in there.
6696880	6699640	But cats are cute, so she gets away with it, right?
6699640	6701080	Yeah, unfortunately she does.
6701080	6702080	What's your cat's name again?
6702080	6703080	Stella.
6703080	6710160	Stella. That's right. Uh, hey, um, the RIAA. Apparently some kitties, some cute kittens
6710160	6715360	went into the RIAA office and just, they made them go, aw, and shucks, because they decided
6715360	6720080	to do something nice this holiday season. They are no longer going to sue individual
6720080	6722840	file sharers or harass universities anymore.
6722840	6724960	Woo! That's our deadly war music!
6724960	6730000	Hold up, hold up. Instead, what the RIAA plans to do is that they are going to report people
6730000	6734760	that they suspect of copyright infringement directly to the ISPs. The ISPs will then investigate
6734760	6738380	the customers and either issue a warning or implement restrictions, whatever they decide
6738380	6744160	is needed. Apparently what the benefit will be to the ISPs, the participation is voluntary,
6744160	6747880	but they'll be able to better control the congestion on their networks by applying this
6747880	6750080	new little policy.
6750080	6755200	Some words from Ars Technica on the original report of this. Suddenly, ISPs gained a tremendous
6755200	6759280	new tool. One study in the UK showed that most people sharing music would stop when
6759280	6763360	made aware that their activity was being tracked and that they were not, in fact, anonymous.
6763360	6767960	Should that hold true in the US, ISPs would presumably see massive decreases in P2P traffic.
6767960	6771340	The customer notifications can be blasted out by email, making the whole process quick
6771340	6775480	and easy for ISPs. As is usual for these sorts of schemes, questions still remain about what
6775480	6779980	sorts of judicial processes will be in place to contest notifications and penalties, and
6779980	6783720	what happens to a household internet connection when Dad finds his access cancelled, even
6783720	6785760	though he's never shared a file in his life.
6785760	6792760	Yeah, whatever. It's not going to work very well, but hey, you know, whatever.
6793400	6794840	So pirate away, everybody!
6794840	6795760	Pretty much.
6795760	6799320	Just kidding. You shouldn't pirate, because that's why all these people got laid off this
6799320	6801960	week, so yeah. It was all your fault.
6801960	6805960	Yeah, it's the RIAA's coming after you for music. So, stop downloading...
6805960	6809440	I wonder if there's any companies that are going to say, nope, we're not participating.
6809440	6810320	Go fuck yourself.
6810320	6813920	Yes, stop downloading music and start downloading movies.
6813920	6817560	J-Rod in chat says, I got a letter from my ISP about downloading HBO shows. It didn't
6817560	6819560	stop my torrenting.
6819560	6825560	Well, I've never received any kind of cease and desist, so...
6825560	6831560	The only letters I received from my ISP is, we're raising your rates. It's like, thanks.
6831560	6838560	You know, and if you're downloading TV shows, I mean, they were on TV... I don't get it.
6838560	6845560	Well, some other very interesting news. Let's move away a little bit from the RIAA bastards.
6848280	6854720	EA and Steam have decided to make sweet love.
6854720	6861720	So there's going to be EA games that are available through Steam's service, which is Mass Effect,
6862560	6868760	Need for Speed Undercover, and Spore, and the Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack, FIFA
6868760	6875760	Manager 09, and Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning. So that's going to be hanging out there.
6876360	6878560	So they're getting steamy?
6878560	6884240	They're getting steamy. Also, others slated for there is Mirror's Edge Command and Conquer,
6884240	6888680	Ad Alert 3, and Dead Space.
6888680	6893680	But not mix steamy, or else the RIAA might sue them for sharing ABC shows.
6893680	6894720	What?
6894720	6898280	Nothing, never mind.
6898280	6900560	If you didn't get that joke, good for you.
6900560	6904440	Who in this room doesn't watch TV? Oh, that's me.
6904440	6908800	Even you watch some TV. You just don't watch TV, like, on TV.
6908800	6911120	I watch DVDs after the fact.
6911120	6911520	There you go.
6911520	6917120	I will going to be watching a show as soon as it's got new episodes on, when it airs.
6917120	6919400	See, American Idol.
6919400	6921520	Supernatural.
6921520	6924040	What if there's David Cook 2 on American Idol next year?
6924040	6924520	No.
6924520	6927600	Will you watch that?
6927600	6932520	And keep in mind, I watched American Idol through YouTube.
6932520	6938160	Well this year they're actually getting rid of, or they're limiting the amount of the
6938160	6940880	bad singers that they have on the show.
6940880	6947280	After that I say, great, another show I don't have to watch anymore.
6947280	6952360	So apparently, you know, Crackdown 2 is a game that I wish would come out, because Crackdown
6952360	6956200	1 was awesome, and it does need a sequel.
6956200	6959880	But of course, you know, Real Time Worlds, they're busy working on the game that I'm
6959880	6964760	going to have to get back into MMOs for, and that would be APB.
6964760	6968640	But until that happens, people still wish for Crackdown 2.
6968640	6973040	Well, there was a rumor that Crackdown 2 was actually being developed by another company,
6973040	6979600	Ruffian Games, however, that may not be the case anymore.
6979600	6985360	The studio head, Colin McDonald, actually said, you know, they would like to make the
6985360	6992000	sequel for Crackdown, although to date they have not been offered for Microsoft for Crackdown
6992000	6993000	sequel.
6993000	6998840	They are having ongoing discussions with them, and they would feel really hurt if Microsoft
6998840	7003840	went to some other studio to develop it.
7003840	7006400	Wasn't there rumors that that's exactly what Microsoft did?
7006400	7010920	Yeah, there was, but they don't know.
7010920	7017040	They said that they would doubt that Microsoft would choose a startup, I guess it says a
7017040	7024240	startup on RTW's doorstep, Ruffian, I don't know why they would choose them, I guess.
7024240	7027440	Jay Roddon in chat says, Crackdown, oh, you meant that bonus disc that came with the Halo
7027440	7029600	3 beta?
7029600	7032160	Yes, that's the one.
7032160	7035760	The game is awesome, okay, seriously.
7035760	7037760	Way better than the Halo 3 beta.
7037760	7039960	It wasn't bad, it wasn't bad.
7039960	7043120	I probably played, actually, in reality, I probably did play more Crackdown than I did
7043120	7044640	Halo 3, and I didn't even know the game.
7044640	7045640	Crackdown was awesome.
7045640	7047440	It was crack.
7047440	7048440	Down.
7048440	7049440	Down.
7049440	7052440	One more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to get into some last minute stories
7052440	7058200	in the Skype line, and this is filed under kind of a little bit of WTF.
7058200	7063080	Xbox Live, you know, XNA has really opened it up in the whole community games thing for
7063080	7067440	people to make literally anything, and that is exactly what's happened, is literally anything
7067440	7069300	has popped up now in the store.
7069300	7076720	It's a game, quote, fireplace, and what it does, it makes all the sights and the sounds
7076720	7082000	of a winter fireplace via your Xbox 360 on the television.
7082000	7085280	It's like one of those, like, you remember the old cassette tapes that was just nothing
7085280	7089080	but the fire that you could play in the background during Christmas?
7089080	7090080	That's basically what this is.
7090080	7091080	Don't you mean a videotape?
7091080	7092080	Huh?
7092080	7093080	Don't you mean a videotape?
7093080	7094080	Yeah.
7094080	7097140	But what did they call it, like a virtual yule log or something like that?
7097140	7098140	Virtual fireplace.
7098140	7099320	I don't know what they call it.
7099320	7104440	They still have those, and they actually have Blu-rays now of virtual fireplaces.
7104440	7105640	People buy this shit.
7105640	7107400	That's the amazing thing.
7107400	7113880	We should make the official OLR yule log and just make tons and tons of money off people's
7113880	7114880	impulse buys.
7114880	7115880	I don't know.
7115880	7116880	Kind of crazy.
7116880	7122520	Apparently, you can get the demo on your Xbox 360, and you can even get that on the internet.
7122520	7125260	Just download it right away, and you can get like a little four-minute demo, but here's
7125260	7126260	the thing.
7126260	7131000	If you want the full version, it's 400 points.
7131000	7137520	Now I'm not going to give this guy a lot of shit because having talked to Aaron on a previous
7137520	7143520	show who made Snake 360 and talking to the community developers, I think there's a certain
7143520	7148720	range of points that they can charge, and so probably 400 is like all this guy can't
7148720	7149720	charge.
7149720	7150720	I don't know.
7150720	7151720	I don't know if he can charge less.
7151720	7152720	No.
7152720	7153720	No?
7153720	7154720	200.
7154720	7155720	I have some for 200.
7155720	7156720	Let's see.
7156720	7157720	Hold on.
7157720	7158720	I want to look at some video of this thing in action here.
7158720	7159720	Let's see.
7159720	7162320	I'm going to actually play a little video.
7162320	7164160	Yep.
7164160	7168000	That is definitely a virtual log.
7168000	7174480	To be honest, you could probably purchase a DVD for cheaper than five bucks.
7174480	7177680	Yeah, you could probably go to the 99 Cents store and get one of these DVDs.
7177680	7182280	The 99 Cents store has some pretty funny movies there.
7182280	7186720	In fact, that'd be really fun to make stocking stuffers with the 99 Cents clearance center
7186720	7187720	movies.
7187720	7188720	Awesome.
7188720	7190160	There's some absolute crap.
7190160	7191160	It's awesome.
7191160	7192160	That's...
7192160	7193520	God, you don't even press a button.
7193520	7198640	It would be awesome if you pressed a button and you could throw a kitten in the fire and
7198640	7199640	watch what happens.
7199640	7200640	A kitten?
7200640	7201640	I'm just kidding.
7201640	7202640	That's wrong.
7202640	7203640	No, I'm kidding.
7203640	7204640	It is wrong, but funny.
7204640	7205640	A reindeer.
7205640	7206640	That's more festive.
7206640	7207640	Or Santa.
7207640	7208720	You just watch Santa dropping the chimney into the fire.
7208720	7212060	See, that would be worth 400 points.
7212060	7214440	Or Christmas lemmings.
7214440	7217720	As Dark Tetsuya in Chat says, or a ferret.
7217720	7219840	There you go.
7219840	7224240	Tiger Claw says, there's even an app on the iPhone and iPod touch of a virtual fireplace
7224240	7226360	for only 99 cents.
7226360	7228320	I got a Zippo lighter one for free.
7228320	7235960	All right, we're going to go to some last minute stories from Loki and then we'll take
7235960	7237880	some calls on our Skype line.
7237880	7241880	Well, there's been some new patches for some PC games.
7241880	7244280	Darkrai 2 got a patch to fix their widescreen issues.
7244280	7247960	Apparently it had the same thing that was wrong with Bioshock with it.
7247960	7251360	They were kind of letterboxing it in the reverse, I guess.
7251360	7254640	But now that's fixed, so yay.
7254640	7258560	And well, other things.
7258560	7263520	Sony is claiming that they're going to get rid of their clamshell packaging.
7263520	7274480	They are working to, I guess, go greener and they actually promoted their little announcement
7274480	7280240	with a crappy video that's called Sony declares death to the clamshell.
7280240	7281680	And it was awful.
7281680	7285840	And I highly recommend that you don't watch it.
7285840	7291160	And other than that, not a whole lot else going on, man.
7291160	7294560	It's like, talk about slow going.
7294560	7299320	Well, it is Christmas week for heaven's sake, but hey, or well, you know, coming up, but
7299320	7303760	I am so excited about the clamshell news because I think those, that packaging is horrible
7303760	7304760	evil stuff.
7304760	7308160	I, oh, oh, grrr.
7308160	7309320	Clamshell packaging can go die in a fire.
7309320	7313120	I'm really excited to hear that's, I want to press a button and watch all my old clamshell
7313120	7314400	packaging get burned in the fire.
7314400	7316200	Cause that annoys me.
7316200	7321520	All right, we're taking your calls 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on orange or her username on Skype
7321520	7322880	is orange lounge radio.
7322880	7325080	I've been doing this a little bit too long.
7325080	7329880	Can you believe next week is our last show of 2008 and then we will go into the year
7329880	7333080	2009, which would be our seventh year of podcasting.
7333080	7337080	If you could believe it or seventh year of doing this show, I guess podcasting has been
7337080	7339520	around seven years, but you know what I mean?
7339520	7340680	Crazy stuff.
7340680	7342480	We're getting old.
7342480	7344120	We're getting old next year.
7344120	7346920	One of us will kill another live on air.
7346920	7347920	Just wait for it.
7347920	7349880	Stay tuned.
7349880	7354800	Would you spend $5 for a yule log game on the 360 where you could throw clamshell packages
7354800	7356000	into the fire?
7356000	7357200	I might.
7357200	7359400	I just might be willing to spend that kind of money.
7359400	7362800	Except you wouldn't because you'd have to use the D pad to do that.
7362800	7363800	And yeah.
7363800	7364800	All right.
7364800	7367440	I'm going to the chat or I'm sorry, the phone.
7367440	7370120	That's getting late and I haven't even cracked open the eggnog yet.
7370120	7371240	Hi, you're on orange lounge radio.
7371240	7372240	Who's this?
7372240	7374240	Legend of Zaku.
7374240	7375520	Hey, Legend of Zaku.
7375520	7376520	What's up?
7376520	7377520	Nothing much.
7377520	7379360	You know, today's my birthday, right?
7379360	7383800	Or for the next less than 40 minutes.
7383800	7387880	Well happy Hanukkah and birthday.
7387880	7389380	Not Jewish.
7389380	7390380	That's all right.
7390380	7393720	You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate Hanukkah.
7393720	7394720	I get gelt.
7394720	7398280	I love those potato latkes though.
7398280	7399280	Hell yeah.
7399280	7400840	One of my friends was supposed to make me some of those.
7400840	7402480	That sounds delish.
7402480	7407040	Sorry, the house is turning into Silent Hill here.
7407040	7411560	The door just blew open into the house and it's kind of creepy because of all the wind
7411560	7414880	blowing outside and the storms.
7414880	7418880	Maybe in our seventh year of podcasting, Pyramid Head will rape us all live on air.
7418880	7419880	Yikes.
7419880	7420880	Nice.
7420880	7421880	All right.
7421880	7422880	What's on your mind, Zaku?
7422880	7424360	Nothing much.
7424360	7428480	Just trying to scurry up as much money as possible to get me something, at least one
7428480	7436640	game for Christmas since the last game I bought was GTA 4 back in May, like April or May.
7436640	7437640	It's been a while.
7437640	7442680	I mean, I'm unemployed right now, I'm trying to find work and I can't be pissing my money
7442680	7447620	away on unnecessary things like that when the bills have to be paid first and foremost.
7447620	7451320	I heard that Prince of Persia dropped in price the 40 bucks.
7451320	7452320	Where at?
7452320	7453320	Everywhere.
7453320	7454320	PC?
7454320	7455320	What, for PC?
7455320	7458320	No, for PS3 and Xbox 360.
7458320	7462680	See, I'm trying to give my PC some love.
7462680	7466600	I was going to ask, what one game are you thinking of buying because you must have something
7466600	7467600	in mind.
7467600	7468600	Left 4 Dead.
7468600	7469600	Left 4 Dead.
7469600	7470600	Ah, Left 4 Dead.
7470600	7471600	Why Left 4 Dead?
7471600	7480560	Well, because that's just like playing Half-Life with zombies but with at least subpar storyline
7480560	7485120	with it and I get to use my keyboard and mouse.
7485120	7486760	Nice.
7486760	7487760	Very cool, very cool.
7487760	7489840	I've heard a lot of good things about Left 4 Dead but I think that's another one of those
7489840	7493680	games that I won't probably actually get to check out until next year just because I'm
7493680	7496200	playing so much other crap like, wow.
7496200	7497200	Yeah.
7497200	7500880	Well, I'm sorry to hear about the financial tough times but, you know, it's something
7500880	7501880	a lot of people are going through.
7501880	7502880	I mean, I have plenty of money saved up.
7502880	7506480	I'm not worried about, you know, the bills but, you know, I can't burn that money that
7506480	7507480	quickly.
7507480	7509400	That money has to last me until I find work.
7509400	7510400	Right.
7510400	7511400	No, that's understandable.
7511400	7512400	Mm-hmm.
7512400	7513400	So, well.
7513400	7515360	Yeah, I mean, I mean, other companies are struggling.
7515360	7519840	I mean, you already had like two or, like about two or three companies going under in
7519840	7520840	one week.
7520840	7521840	Six.
7521840	7523800	Six, well, not necessarily going under but doing layoffs.
7523800	7527120	Six companies doing some type of closure or cutbacks this week.
7527120	7532280	I know, I know Factor 5 and I think Free Radical went belly up.
7532280	7534280	Yeah, we reported on it.
7534280	7536400	I don't know if you were here at the very beginning of the show but we kicked off the
7536400	7537400	show.
7537400	7541760	Factor 5, EA, Midway, Free Radical, Asper and Turbine all did some type of closure or
7541760	7543800	layoff this week.
7543800	7546240	Looks like someone's not having a Christmas party this year.
7546240	7548160	No, and it sucks.
7548160	7549320	It's really too bad.
7549320	7550320	It's really too bad.
7550320	7553520	Well, you used to work in like cell phone games and stuff.
7553520	7554520	Yes, I do.
7554520	7555520	Are you surprised?
7555520	7558760	And then this time last year I had a really nice Christmas party complete with like all
7558760	7564080	you can eat stuff, open bar, you know, Guitar Hero, SingStar right there on a big, you know,
7564080	7565920	on a nice big projection.
7565920	7569040	Are you surprised by what's happened?
7569040	7571000	I mean, it's shitty all around.
7571000	7577040	It's like, you know, ask anybody, I bet you know at least 3 or 4 or 5 people that you
7577040	7580440	know personally that are probably unemployed right now and are struggling to find work
7580440	7582760	in this economy.
7582760	7586880	I mean, I have so many skills right now.
7586880	7592480	My experience is that I'm trying my best to secure work but it's a clusterfuck because
7592480	7594920	I'm not the only one fighting for that same job.
7594920	7599700	It's like hundreds upon thousands of other people fighting for that same position, especially
7599700	7601280	here in New York.
7601280	7603560	It is very, very tough out there right now.
7603560	7605560	It's very tough.
7605560	7610600	You're lucky you still have work whereas, you know, I had to work as a contractor, you
7610600	7616160	know, since early this year since I got laid off from my full-time job.
7616160	7621120	And so, you know, I was connected and I had resources but they ran out over the summer.
7621120	7623740	Oh no, I'm thankful to have a job.
7623740	7627340	You know, I stopped bitching about the promotion I was supposed to get because a while ago
7627340	7631920	they were trying to give me a promotion to work and I stopped bitching about it for now
7631920	7635080	because I realized that, you know, I should just be lucky to have a job right now so I'm
7635080	7636080	just going to shut up.
7636080	7637080	Yeah.
7637080	7641000	It's better to have a job, you know, better to be working than not be working at all like
7641000	7642000	me right now.
7642000	7643000	Yeah.
7643000	7647440	So, well, Zaku, best of luck in your search, maybe for your birthday, somebody will give
7647440	7648440	you a new job.
7648440	7652060	Well, hopefully if you want, you know, I could give you my resume, see what you could do
7652060	7653060	with it.
7653060	7656840	But then again, I live out, you know, here in New York so it wouldn't make any sense
7656840	7659700	if I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm
7659700	7660700	sending it all.
7660700	7661700	Okay.
7661700	7664000	Which unfortunately, I don't think I have the money to do right now.
7664000	7666720	What the crap happened there?
7666720	7668220	We got like bad echo and Skype.
7668220	7669280	That was awesome.
7669280	7671800	I think closed on me.
7671800	7673420	That was weird.
7673420	7674480	Okay.
7674480	7675480	Wow.
7675480	7677020	I swear we didn't do any thing.
7677020	7679560	What the crap was that?
7679560	7681540	Skype just crashed on us in studio.
7681540	7684500	We got the error message and that happened.
7684500	7685500	What the?
7685500	7686500	robot
7686500	7690380	okay first no dude this is like the beginning of a scary movie right here
7690380	7692800	first we had the door blew open
7692800	7696680	then we have uh... something happened with zaku on the skype line there

7704520	7707400	but i didn't do anything either that's a weird thing
7707400	7711760	this is crazy
7711760	7715660	let's take one more call hi uh...
7715660	7718740	i saw something come up and i got excited are you going to sleep jamie?

7726380	7729340	this is dark knight y'all must had a one miss call moment
7729340	7731700	hi dark knight what's on your mind buddy
7731700	7735280	y'all must had a one miss call moment or something when that happened
7735280	7738060	uh... it was it's very weird i don't know what the hell's going on with
7738060	7741600	skype we'll see maybe i need to upgrade but i thought i just upgraded last week
7741600	7743620	but whatever what's on your mind buddy
7743620	7747500	uh... talking about the layoffs and what not free radical i got
7747500	7749180	free radical i can understand
7749180	7754100	them shutting their doors and what not cause like i said they had one bus game and whatnot
7754100	7759640	it didn't really do much for really make much money for them at all
7759640	7760760	and what not
7760760	7765220	well yeah i mean you know it's still unfortunate they won't get a chance to
7765220	7768320	do a second one you know what i mean that's true
7768320	7772220	and they said they were working on the time splitter game right
7772220	7773220	yeah so
7773220	7779760	i mean i can understand that as far as mid weighting them doing layoffs and what not
7779760	7783800	that one kind of hard to swallow because i mean
7783800	7789260	the latest mortal kombat and what not they've been making their money off of that
7789260	7792080	i did see the mortal kombat team was left intact
7792080	7795920	mortal kombat team was left intact ok yeah mid weights kind of had a rough year outside of mortal combat
7795920	7799080	Mortal Kombat you know we don't really know how the other games is selling yet
7799080	7802280	but some of their other high-profile titles did not follow through the way
7802280	7805360	they should and to be honest I can't think of a lot of Midway games I've
7805360	7809840	gotten really excited about this year which is kind of a bummer but you know
7809840	7813240	yeah I thought I would hear people talk about Blitz but I don't even think I
7813240	7815960	heard people was talking about Blitz and everything like that
7815960	7819640	no no but then EA I mean EA is kind of you know their year hasn't been that
7819640	7823840	terrible yet they did a lot of layoffs too so it's kind of that's and that is a
7823840	7828440	big shocker to hear that EA I figured I made comment earlier saying that if one
7828440	7832520	of the big comp big game manufacturing companies did have any issues had layoffs
7832520	7836840	did we really be scratching our heads if anything else it would be interesting to
7836840	7843280	see if Nintendo say or not say a Nintendo Sony or Microsoft gets any
7843280	7846880	brunt of this but I wouldn't think so because Nintendo they don't have a lot
7846880	7850400	of workforce here you know compared to what they have over in Japan same with
7850400	7854200	Sony and then Microsoft you know I i you know they're doing pretty well for
7854200	7857720	themselves and Microsoft and so you know especially companies like Microsoft and
7857720	7861180	Sony really have much more than just well then again last week we talked
7861180	7865440	about layoffs to Sony didn't we so I guess maybe the Big 3 aren't infallible
7865440	7866480	Governments
7866480	7868680	entertainment oh thank you
7868680	7873220	it's from general the general company I don't think it was for entertainment
7873220	7876280	division but at least Microsoft Sony you know they have all those other divisions
7876280	7878840	their company they're huge huge companies not just about the games still
7878840	7885120	right still still and I mean it just and then you think about it then Sega is
7885120	7888960	like Sega having their bad luck streak with their games and whatnot all the
7888960	7893720	Sonic games and whatnot then find out problems with problems with their
7893720	7899920	online gaming division and stuff like that I'm like here we go
7899920	7907280	If Sega were to go then I'd be a lost sheep
7907280	7912880	you know I would cry with you it's just it's not just that but just that all
7912880	7916120	these companies are getting swallowed up by other companies too you know what I mean
7916120	7923320	yeah like um Koei and um Tecmo tried to go over combinations that coming up
7923320	7930760	when companies that join forces and whatnot try to save money yikes yikes scary scary
7930760	7933640	times well Dark Knight anything else on your mind before we let you go tonight

8075920	8080240	wiki I am and I just had to actually change something because I said that I
8080240	8084360	was I got my name in high school it was actually in college I haven't looked at
8084360	8089400	the wiki in a while you know I was looking at it out of you know not a bad
8089400	8093880	job though yeah it's all really good I mean it's growing I'm really mine just
8093880	8099120	the last time I looked at it mine just said tune into this show to hear about
8099120	8105560	Rob's life I thought was funny link to my myspace that's cute cuz I never
8105560	8111680	updated anymore I will say this my final thought my final thought is shit cakes
8111680	8120760	I think that the different levels and this is a different difficulty so I was
8120760	8126320	gonna play him in order but apparently one's like a level five and five-star
8126320	8130560	that's kind of hard to get my ass kicked pretty quick I still want to see a
8130560	8134760	little more about this game do you have a can't use the video thing that I tried
8134760	8138600	that later cuz I there was an update that they allowed like PlayStation
8138600	8142480	Network software to do to be able to output but it's only a classic
8142480	8147160	PlayStation games and that sucks that's bullshit
