28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
37000	43000	We are that video game show dedicated to all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
44000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
48000	52000	Ah! Ah! Ah! You're back, welcome back!
53000	58000	I am! Alright! And what an amazing two weeks off it's been! I know, don't rub it in! Not really!
59000	66000	You've had all this time off, no I'm just kidding. We are a little late tonight in starting the show, this won't affect anybody listening to this on the podcast
67000	71000	Except for the fact that the podcast has been going up extremely late lately. That's because we're all pregnant.
72000	74000	But no, we're not all pregnant!
74000	79000	Let me introduce Tech Master Loki, who I hope is not pregnant, Jesus. Are you pregnant, Loki?
80000	81000	No, I am not.
82000	90000	Welcome Tech Master Loki. We're starting a little late tonight, 7 o'clock Pacific, just because there's personal life things going on that have to, real life, greater than gaming
91000	92000	Rob has PMS
93000	94000	Yes, I have PMS, and I'm having a baby.
95000	101000	Alright, also say hello to a special guest we have here tonight, Jamie has brought one of her friends here to giggle with us tonight on the show
101000	103000	Say hello to Becky!
104000	104000	Greetings.
105000	107000	Hello, do you have an online name you use, Becky, that you want people to call you?
108000	108000	Uh, Beckers.
109000	113000	Beckers! I like that. Beckers! It makes me think of Beckum.
114000	117000	Alright, Beckers. Anyhow...
118000	119000	Yeah, but he married a hoochie.
120000	121000	Posh Spice is pretty hot.
122000	122000	It's a hoochie!
123000	124000	Anyway, Beckers!
125000	125000	Her boobs don't move!
126000	128000	Beckers, what type of video games do you enjoy? Do you play a lot of video games? What do you like?
128000	133000	Really only Rock Band and Karaoke Revolution.
134000	135000	The hell else do you need right about now?
136000	142000	I have really bad tinnitus, so if I try to hold controllers, badness ensues, and then I cry.
143000	147000	You know what though? Nothing wrong with the music game love. We love music games here at Orange Mountains Radio. It's our roots.
148000	153000	So we'll definitely be talking more about Rock Band later on. We've got some stories tonight about Rock Band.
153000	157000	Before we get there, we've got to talk about our gaming week. So let's talk about a dark soccer. How was your gaming week?
158000	158000	I refuse.
159000	159000	Refuse?
160000	160000	I'm kidding.
161000	162000	How dare you refuse?
163000	170000	I played some Rock Band. I've been playing Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, and I'm very pissed off at it right now, so I took a break.
171000	172000	Because it's fucking hard!
173000	175000	Yeah, it is. I had the same problem.
175000	186000	I'm going to actually go back and re-level just on that first thing, just because. It's such a pain in the butt. And I got Animal Crossing, and I have been beating my animals with a bug net.
187000	188000	Awesome.
189000	193000	But I accidentally stole my shovel, and stupid Nook, that butthead, won't get anyone in.
194000	199000	You know, I was telling Nelly because there's this one stupid rabbit in her town named Francine.
200000	201000	I know which one that is!
201000	212000	Yes, that she absolutely hates. I said that we have to form a hit squad, and just have everybody with bug nets all of a sudden chase her down, like get her trapped in one of those pitfalls, and just all four people hitting her at the same time.
213000	214000	That would be hilarious.
215000	216000	Do you know who fucking showed up in my village?
217000	217000	Who?
218000	224000	Pearl. I hate her. She's a little cat that looks like, oh god, she looks like she has like burn scars all over her face.
225000	226000	Guess who's in my village?
227000	227000	Wolfgang.
228000	229000	He's fucking awesome.
229000	232000	I can't believe we're having this discussion about a game made for 12 year olds.
233000	235000	Guess what? I got a buddy in my town.
236000	237000	I want the lesbian to move back into my town.
238000	240000	What was her name? Was that Barbara? No, Barbara was a sheep.
241000	246000	She was a duck, I think, and had gym equipment in her house, so we put rainbow signs outside of her house.
247000	253000	And she was our, we put all kinds of happy signs and sent her letters, and the bitch moved out.
254000	255000	Was it Pauline Hall?
255000	259000	If that is not, you know, you think you know somebody, and you move in after a month.
260000	261000	No, it wasn't Pauline Hall.
262000	265000	I'm sorry, that's, you know, she just got pissy and moved out.
266000	269000	She probably moved in with her girlfriend after the second date, like most lesbians.
270000	276000	That's what I was thinking, she moved out of my village, because I got boring and wouldn't, you know, send her any more letters or peaches.
277000	279000	And she moved out, bitch.
280000	281000	Lesbians are so needy.
281000	284000	Anyhow.
285000	292000	Dan's been playing Need for Speed Undercover, and I've been mocking him, because it's fun and easy.
293000	301000	And then, even though it's not a video game, I've been watching a lot of Supernatural, which is more fun.
302000	305000	Because I got to watch Jensen Ackles naked.
306000	307000	Well, not completely.
307000	313000	Not completely, but it was a lot more exciting than playing Animal Crossing.
314000	317000	Remind me, this is a show geared towards 16-year-old girls?
318000	319000	Hell no!
320000	321000	It's geared towards me.
322000	323000	It's on the CW.
324000	325000	We forgive it.
326000	327000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
328000	329000	My gaming week was alright.
330000	333000	I watched my wife play a lot of Animal Crossing, because I'm not allowed near it, I guess.
333000	337000	It's because you're going to go around and make all of your villagers say nasty things.
338000	339000	No, she's already done that.
340000	347000	She already has the Genji, the Asian-looking rabbit, saying, you are my best rubber.
348000	356000	And there was a bunch of stuff that she's done.
357000	359000	She harasses her animals quite a bit.
359000	364000	Dude, do you know that now it censors things? Like, you can't just have your animals say fuck.
365000	370000	And I tried to get mine to say poop, and it wouldn't say it. It said, that word is not allowed.
371000	372000	I have to tell you, though.
373000	374000	So now he says poop.
375000	378000	There was a version that got out that was supposed to be some kind of ad.
379000	383000	They used all the foreign letters that look like other letters.
384000	385000	They used the accents.
386000	387000	No, this is different.
387000	389000	The version that went out to give into a selected group as a marketing tool?
390000	394000	Yeah, it was exactly that. It was using those other letters.
395000	399000	But one of the animals defaulted, their little catch word was the N word.
400000	403000	But the way they got around it was they put N and then an I with an accent.
404000	406000	Well, no, it was someone who was one of the programmers.
407000	408000	I know, I know.
409000	411000	Or they probably copied something to test it.
412000	414000	They copied a ROM with someone that had already played it and unlocked all the stuff.
414000	417000	That's what it was. But yeah, they, I don't know.
418000	421000	Should maybe look at that first, you know? Do a little testing.
422000	424000	But you know they can't make it to level 30 because the boss doesn't show up.
425000	426000	Someone's getting fired.
428000	436000	Anyways, so other than watching my wife play Animal Crossing, I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV on the 360.
437000	438000	Still doing multiplayer and that, and that's fun.
438000	445000	And then I decided to try out the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV, which, you know, actually looks pretty good.
446000	453000	I've heard a lot of people having trouble getting it to run, and I don't understand what they're doing that's making it not run.
454000	457000	Maybe it's because my monitor resolution only goes up to 1440 by 900.
458000	463000	I'm not sure, but, or 1400 by 900, not 1440.
463000	472000	But it runs pretty good for me. You know, 40, 50 frames per second, and I have a lot of sliders put up all the way.
473000	480000	Although I don't like the fact that this brand new game does not support SLI, so that's kind of a waste.
481000	483000	And it's got to be patched in later on.
484000	487000	You know, absolute laziness, just to get it out.
487000	493000	But as far as any, you know, I mean, it looks good, it runs pretty good, but it's just Grand Theft Auto IV.
494000	498000	After playing it for a little bit, you know, kind of starting a new game in there, I was like, wow, this is boring.
499000	500000	You know, I've already done all this.
501000	504000	But it looks nice. That's pretty cool. Just waiting for all the mods and stuff to come out.
505000	511000	And then, other than that, I actually played some Mirror's Edge, and that was a pretty cool game, and I look forward to playing more of that.
512000	515000	Kind of a controversial game, that Mirror's Edge. What do you think?
515000	521000	It's fun. It's hard. You know, very, very hard. You'll fall off the building a lot.
522000	526000	But I think people are pissed off because it's, you know, short.
527000	534000	And, you know, sure, I guess it doesn't innovate much, but the way I look at it is, is it fun? Yes.
535000	536000	So then what are you complaining about?
536000	545000	But, yeah, I'll have to play some more of that. I hear it is really short. In fact, I believe, what was it?
546000	560000	Yahtzee had reviewed it this week, and, man, said he beat it in a day, so it'll be interesting to see how long it takes me to finish it.
560000	567000	Then I've got a bunch of other games on my plate. In fact, I got another one this week, which I haven't even touched yet, Prince of Persia, so that looks pretty fun, too.
568000	569000	Well, lots of stuff.
570000	576000	Alright, good times. Well, my gaming week's been Animal Crossing. I finally, you know, a couple weeks ago, I think I mentioned Animal Crossing, but didn't really get too far into it.
577000	579000	I really spent some serious time with Animal Crossing on the Wii this week, and you know what?
580000	587000	As much as we're joking around and kind of talking about reliving the thrill of the GameCube version all over again, I have a real hard time recommending this game overall.
587000	597000	Because it's just not enough new for me, and I kind of feel like there's Animal Crossing on the GameCube out there for much cheaper, and you almost get more in it.
598000	610000	But there are some cool things in this game. The problem with this game is it feels like it's just a port of the DS version with a couple extra frills, and it just kind of leaves an Animal Crossing fan really wanting more.
610000	618000	I think they should have taken more risks with this game than they did, although I will say the internet functionality works pretty cool.
619000	625000	They have worked Wii Connect 24 into it a little bit, so you don't really have to go to somebody's village to send letters and things of that nature, which is an improvement over the DS version.
626000	629000	But is that really worth the whole new upgrade? Not so much.
630000	638000	And the city is a neat idea, but I think as it brought up on the show a couple weeks ago, it makes you kind of miss it when it would randomly show up in your village.
638000	648000	And they still do randomly show up in your village, actually, but then that also begs the point, what the hell is the city for? I mean, it doesn't really do a whole lot.
649000	656000	The city is for getting all of your special characters who only would randomly show up. This is so you can have the convenience of having them all the damn time.
657000	660000	Yeah, I think that's stupid. It takes away the special part of it.
660000	668000	No way. You still get presents floating on balloons, and you still get Gulliver showing up.
669000	676000	Wild World didn't really hold me all that well, but this one, I'm really digging it.
677000	685000	You know, it's weird. I kind of feel the same way. The DS one got old really fast, but for some reason I have been actually going back to the Wii one to kind of see if there's new stuff, but it's weird.
685000	694000	Like, I say all this, yet I can't in good conscience really recommend this game. You have to really be hardcore about these types of games to get a thrill out of this.
695000	699000	You have to really be an Animal Crossing fan, of which I was. But I'm still left wanting more.
700000	704000	For me, it's my sit down for an hour and relax. Seriously.
705000	708000	I got wow. But I, you know...
709000	709000	Addict?
709000	717000	Addict? Yeah, but still. So, I guess that's pretty much all I have to say about Animal Crossing. There's not a lot more I can say about it.
718000	722000	As far as other new games I've been playing, not a whole lot. Just basically still been using the Xbox 360 for Netflix.
723000	726000	I finally dinged level 80 in World of Warcraft. Thank you very much. Kiss my feet.
727000	731000	Or tell me to get a life, one of the two. But that's been fun.
731000	741000	And the consensus overall amongst at least my guild, which is a casual raiding guild. We were never very hardcore about the endgame.
742000	751000	It's all the people from Final Fantasy XI still. A lot of the same people that were there moved over here. Even Glenn and some of these people from old school.
752000	754000	That would be the turkey coma.
754000	763000	But yeah, it's been a lot of fun. We're raiding guild. The general consensus is this expansion is better than the last one.
764000	766000	The stuff they did with it is much better. I love the music.
767000	769000	Are there any new classes? Like new races or anything?
770000	771000	Death Knight is pretty awesome.
772000	773000	Maybe I might have to start playing it again.
774000	777000	You have to have a level 55 character though to do a Death Knight. Because Death Knight is what they call a hero class.
777000	787000	But they did a great job with it. The voices and stuff, they took the old voices and they made them sound echoey and powerful when your Death Knight talks.
788000	789000	And it's very sexy.
790000	791000	Rob, can you help me power level?
792000	794000	I can try. I have a level 20-something priest.
795000	798000	I've also been playing Ragnarok and you can play that with me.
799000	800000	We'll see. I've got a lot of games to play.
800000	806000	I can get you to level 100 in two hours. I'm not joking.
807000	815000	Speaking of pirate servers, there used to be a bunch for a while. Blizzard went on a huge crackdown this week on the private servers to shut them all down.
816000	818000	Oh yeah, a bunch of the huge ones got shut down.
819000	823000	Some comments from chat room. ActDeft in chat says, Sky, your voice like that? Not sexy.
823000	829000	I know, you have to have the bassiness and the vocally echo that you can only really do with a computer.
830000	832000	But I gotta say this, the Lich King sounds awesome.
833000	840000	And one cool thing that they did with this new expansion is that the Lich King shows up in the earlier content so that it really builds up to this confrontation that you're going to have with Lich King.
841000	842000	It's not even in the damn game yet.
843000	845000	Because he'll be the last boss they patch in six months from now.
846000	848000	So they make it more like a conventional RPG? Is that it?
848000	853000	Yeah, you actually see him. They did a much better job with this expansion. I think they learned a lot from the last one.
854000	862000	See, that's the one thing I would really like to see in an MMO is that they have it function like an actual RPG where you have to do point A to point B.
863000	869000	Where your quests are not just, oh look, this person has question mark over his head and I want money.
870000	876000	They're getting better with that. The chain quests, the story is getting better. The lore fans are really enjoying their wow this time around.
876000	886000	If that's the case, because honestly, part of the reason why I like Ragnarok so much is that it's just random. It's very social for me.
887000	892000	And I didn't really enjoy actually playing World of Warcraft because it got really dull.
893000	896000	You might also be on the wrong server. You should try a roleplay server on WoW. You might have fun.
897000	903000	I was on a roleplay server actually and I didn't. No one stays in character. It's annoying. I just rather hang out with everybody.
903000	912000	When you finally get the battle and defeat the Lich King, he'll be all, I have one last thing to say. Don't forget Guitar Hero 5 pre-orders and blah blah blah.
913000	915000	And Starcraft 2 is right around the corner.
916000	918000	Shut up. You forgot Diablo 3.
919000	921000	Oh, and Diablo 3. Warcraft 4.
922000	924000	I like how you tried to do your lazy bass echo.
925000	927000	Your Lich King sounds like a drunken asshole.
928000	931000	Hey, how much have you really gotten to know the Lich King yet?
931000	937000	Yes, DJ Tyrant hit the nail on the head. The last expansion had nothing like Wrathgate.
938000	942000	He says Wrathgate is one of the absolutely best questlines of all time. In-game cutscenes for the win.
943000	947000	They have cutscenes in the quest this time and they're epic. Epic cutscenes are very epic.
948000	955000	And Wrathgate was hot. Everybody in our guild, because we're all WoW nerds, was having a gigantic orgasm over the Wrathgate questline because it was awesome.
955000	961000	See, that sounds like it would be more fun to me just having actual story to follow.
962000	966000	I don't want to spoil what happens in Wrathgate, but it's pretty amazing. It's pretty epic.
967000	971000	You get to learn a little more about the phasing technology and it's cool. It's cool.
972000	978000	Anyhow, let's talk about other games this week and we'll get into the gaming news right after some housekeeping.
978000	984000	Tonight's show is a short show. That's because we started late tonight at 7 o'clock due to some personal business.
985000	987000	We'll be back with our full show next week, so sorry about that.
988000	993000	Again, you can always listen to us live on All Games Radio, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.
994000	1001000	Speaking of Bobby, he's got a new project and we love Bobby because he always plugs our show on, so we're going to plug him a little bit.
1001000	1007000	He is going to start a new show that launches January 9th and it's called Friday Night Gaming.
1008000	1012000	It's going to be him and two other people talking in a live program about video games.
1013000	1015000	Why does this sound familiar to me? No, I'm kidding.
1016000	1022000	The niche is that they're actually taping it live at a place called Computer Arena, which is in Roswell, Georgia.
1023000	1024000	Not the same Roswell where they found aliens.
1025000	1028000	They don't keep aliens there. They keep redneck aliens there.
1028000	1035000	But it's actually going to be like they're going to do the interaction with the live crowd as well as the people in the chat room.
1036000	1037000	That sounds awesome.
1038000	1044000	They're going to have some neat co-hosts and stuff too, so I don't know how much more I can say because I don't know what he said yet, but it's going to be cool.
1045000	1051000	So listen to it. FNGlive.net and that starts January 9th on All Games Radio.
1052000	1054000	Anyhow, that's really all the housekeeping I have tonight.
1054000	1057000	So how about some gaming news, even though it's been kind of a slow news week?
1058000	1060000	So a short show seems appropriate tonight. Loki, what's up?
1061000	1068000	Well, there is a certain Kingdom Hearts game that's scheduled to come out for the DS and you may have heard about it.
1069000	1076000	Kingdom Hearts 358 slash 2 days is going to be getting a North American release.
1076000	1084000	I mean, did anyone have any speculation that it wasn't going to get a release here? I mean, seriously.
1085000	1091000	And of course, they aren't really seeing when it's coming, but that it is.
1092000	1093000	Soon.
1094000	1095000	I'm guessing next year sometime.
1096000	1097000	How about Kingdom Hearts 3?
1098000	1100000	Never. I don't know.
1101000	1102000	They're going to pull a Capcom.
1102000	1114000	Kingdom Hearts 2, you have to understand, is like Final Fantasy VII or the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII, where it's got to have 90 billion versions for it first before they move on to the next one.
1115000	1116000	Then they can hoard that one out.
1117000	1121000	Got to wear out the first prostitute first before they can move on to the next.
1122000	1123000	Awesome.
1124000	1128000	I still want my Kingdom Hearts 3, though, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1128000	1132000	That would be very nice with my high-def graphics and hopefully working camera.
1133000	1135000	Although, Kingdom Hearts 2 wasn't bad as far as the camera goes.
1136000	1138000	I thought Kingdom Hearts 2 was really solid.
1139000	1140000	Kingdom Hearts 2 is a very solid game. Good time.
1141000	1142000	I need to actually not glitch mine out.
1143000	1145000	I miss games like that. It's been a little while.
1146000	1147000	When did Kingdom Hearts 2 come out? 2005? 2006, maybe?
1148000	1149000	I think.
1150000	1155000	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some other news and some other games that are dated that are highly anticipated.
1155000	1158000	Probably another anticipated game by Jamie. Tekken 6.
1159000	1166000	It's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and it's been confirmed that it will be in the fall 2009 timeframe.
1167000	1172000	So the Xbox 360 is supposed to... I don't know if it's getting a slightly earlier launch or something,
1173000	1176000	but they're going to hit generally the same time, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
1177000	1182000	This official announcement was made by Atari, who is publishing the game over in Europe.
1182000	1188000	There you have it. So it's not going to be in the same timeframe as Street Fighter 4,
1189000	1193000	and we know there's not going to be a new Mortal Kombat next year because they just had one this year.
1194000	1197000	Well then, I don't know. They were putting out those Mortal Kombat games a dime a dozen for a little bit.
1198000	1202000	They could still do another Mortal Kombat game because all they would really have to do is port the engine over and add new characters.
1203000	1209000	Let's face it, Mortal Kombat and Tekken have very, very different fan bases, so I don't think there's going to be any overlap there anyway.
1209000	1217000	Very cool. Tekken 6 coming soon. No mention about arcades, though. Sad. I weep for the arcade.
1218000	1219000	Really? Where is the market going?
1220000	1226000	Well, they do have the arcade version should be already out in Japan, I think. It's not coming over here.
1227000	1233000	Actually, it would probably be in the Namco arcades because I remember when all the last series of Tekken games came out,
1233000	1240000	they were released something like six months before, you know, in Namco arcades before they were in any others,
1241000	1245000	because we had Tekken 3 at my arcade for like ages before anyone else had it.
1246000	1252000	But, how about something that isn't related to Tekken? Ooh. WiiWare.
1253000	1256000	All right. WiiWare. The stuff I'm boycotting.
1257000	1259000	Oh, come on, Rob. You know they have the S-
1259000	1263000	True. They did promise that they'd have more storage, but where the fuck's the update?
1264000	1265000	Probably March.
1266000	1270000	That's just like Sony's home. Where the fuck is Sony's home? I can't play it, therefore it's not out yet.
1271000	1279000	Sorry, Dr. Sakura. What can the more common folk who are not stuck up enough to be boycotting the Nintendo Wii, what can they be playing?
1279000	1288000	There are more games coming out. There's actually going to be art style Roto Hex.
1289000	1294000	That's a remake of the generation's game Dial Hex that was on the Game Boy Advance.
1295000	1298000	There's also, that's actually going to be 600 Wii points.
1299000	1306000	Episode 4 of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People on its way, and it will have the DANGERESK 3 theme.
1306000	1308000	Ooh. It's 1000 Wii points.
1309000	1316000	I will allow you to get the Strong Bad game, because it's pretty awesome, but I do want to point out it's also available on PC, if you don't want to put up with the Nintendo Wii.
1317000	1319000	Just saying. Is all.
1320000	1327000	You know, I want to know when the hell they're doing an art style version of Dot Stream, because that was the most kickass bit generation game that they released.
1328000	1331000	That and Sound Voyager I guess is supposed to be pretty good, but I never picked that one up.
1331000	1343000	Well, there are also, there's also Bang, which is a shape matching game, and Pit Crew Panic, which should make sense. It's mechanics for broken things.
1344000	1346000	That's the one where you fix toilets. Remember there was a giant toilet one?
1347000	1348000	Well that sounds like fun.
1349000	1351000	I think we talked about that a little bit.
1352000	1353000	Let's see here.
1354000	1356000	Actually, let me get some chat comments before we get to some other stuff here.
1356000	1363000	Some comments on Kingdom Hearts. VXJ's next V. Kingdom Hearts 2 was released March 28th, 2006.
1364000	1366000	Actually, I need to credit Noah Bennett for that too, because they both said it.
1367000	1371000	It was 2006 when that was released, but Act Def goes on to point out a pretty good point.
1372000	1376000	Oblivion, Beat Mania, and Kingdom Hearts 2 were all released the same week. That was a very busy week.
1377000	1380000	Black Wolf wants to point out that Strong Bad is also cheaper on the PC. Good point.
1380000	1387000	And YYR in chat I believe is commenting on the Tekken 6 story. The arcade version will not be released in North America.
1388000	1391000	They announced that a while back. I don't remember when. Selected arcades in the USA do have it.
1392000	1394000	There's like three in New York. I've played it. It rocks.
1395000	1399000	And there will be an upgrade called Bloodline Rebellion. All of that from YYR.
1400000	1408000	I was going to mention, since we're on the topic of WiiWare, Xbox Live Arcade will be getting Meteos Wars and Power Up forever this week as well.
1408000	1412000	Really? I love Meteos, but I can't imagine not playing it with a stylus.
1413000	1421000	You know I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi through the good times like Luminous and the bad times like 99 Nights.
1422000	1425000	I love that man, and I will get Meteos just because it's Q Entertainment.
1426000	1430000	But I really like the DS one. It was kind of underrated. Just saying.
1431000	1435000	But I can't imagine not playing that game without the stylus. That's all.
1435000	1437000	Yeah. Sorry.
1438000	1445000	Let's see. Well, other things that you can expect this week. It's a very short list, unfortunately, because it is this time of year.
1446000	1453000	Most games have already been released for Christmas, but there are a few late editions, including Prince of Persia on the PC.
1454000	1457000	Who's Tardy to the party? Who's stumbling in hungover to the Christmas party?
1457000	1464000	And Sonic Unleashed on PS3. Both of those versions coming out way later. Well, not really.
1465000	1466000	Who got toked up off Mad Dog at home?
1467000	1471000	Not too late for Prince of Persia, but a couple weeks before Sonic Unleashed at the very least.
1472000	1481000	Other titles coming out, and I'm not really going to say they're worth mentioning, but Imagine Fashion Party on the Wii. Awesome.
1482000	1485000	Imagine Saving Your Money. Imagine donating it to charity.
1485000	1494000	Neopets Puzzle Adventure, which looks like a ripoff of Puzzle Quest, just with Neopets. Does anyone still play Neopets?
1495000	1499000	I was just talking about playing Neopets the other day because I miss playing the little games on the side.
1500000	1501000	But you weren't playing them.
1502000	1503000	Exactly.
1504000	1505000	Let's see.
1506000	1511000	I was talking about Neopets the other day in the mall when I was walking by Claire's. Do they have Claire's nationwide? Is that a nationwide chain?
1511000	1520000	Yeah. Okay. Well, for the international audience, Claire's is like the pretty, pretty princess store. It's the store for 11-year-old girls who want to dress up like princesses.
1521000	1523000	And you can stop with the comments right now about how much I love Claire's.
1524000	1529000	But I was looking in the window, not in the store, but in the window, and they had all these Neopets things for sale.
1530000	1536000	And I was telling my friend, I remember when I used to play Neopets. Damn, I needed a life. So, that's all.
1537000	1538000	And you don't now?
1538000	1540000	Hey, watch it.
1541000	1543000	Core on DS. That'll be coming out.
1544000	1545000	Let's see.
1546000	1548000	Hidden Expedition, Amazon.
1549000	1552000	And The Tale of Despereaux, both on PC.
1553000	1557000	Other titles for this week. Slingo Quest on DS.
1558000	1562000	Lego, or was it Left Brain, Right Brain 2 on DS.
1562000	1568000	Driver's Ed Portable. Yes, you can practice your Driver's Ed tests on the DS now.
1569000	1588000	Build A Lot, which I believe is like a real estate tycoon type game.
1588000	1592000	Ski and Shoot, yet another biathlon game.
1593000	1596000	God, I just want to play some more biathlon.
1597000	1600000	Dungeon Maker 2, The Hidden War on PSP.
1601000	1604000	Kate West, The Vanishing Files on DS.
1605000	1611000	And, of course, the big one for the week, Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 on PS2.
1612000	1615000	And that is the special edition that comes with the soundtrack.
1615000	1618000	Because Atlus is really hooking you up.
1619000	1620000	Yes.
1621000	1624000	And I have to say that it's only going to get worse from here.
1625000	1628000	Oh, because the next few weeks are crap.
1629000	1632000	Wow. I think Rock Band's in there somewhere, but the rest of the weeks suck.
1633000	1635000	Alright, well, let's see if things are looking a little brighter in Japan.
1636000	1638000	And they are. It's a little busier of a week in Japan.
1639000	1643000	Strangely enough, usually Japan gets the really cool stuff before we do.
1643000	1647000	However, in this case, Japan's getting some of the cool stuff after we are.
1648000	1650000	Because that happens sometimes when the games are developed over here.
1651000	1654000	Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts is going to be released over in Japan on December 11th.
1655000	1657000	As is Mirror's Edge in Japan on the Xbox 360.
1658000	1660000	Also being released December 11th on the PlayStation 3.
1661000	1664000	Hakuna Matata is getting it.
1665000	1666000	That's actually a General Asia release.
1667000	1668000	Did that game ever get released here in the US?
1668000	1675000	No, it's going to be released here under, I think Namco is doing it, under National Geographic Africa.
1676000	1677000	That's a better name.
1678000	1680000	Did that game get a facelift all of a sudden, didn't it?
1681000	1684000	Yeah, they're changing it up for here. It's not coming over here for a while, though.
1685000	1687000	I want to see animals eating each other.
1688000	1693000	Well, Hakuna Matata gets the General Asia release. It's an English-Chinese version, so you could import it technically, December 11th.
1694000	1696000	But I want to see the monkeys throw poo and do it.
1696000	1701000	Or you could import the UK version, which I believe is in English, and I think is already out.
1702000	1703000	Oh, there you go.
1704000	1706000	Mina no Golf 5 gets a price reduction this week, this Friday.
1707000	1711000	Mirror's Edge also comes to the PlayStation 3, and Virtua Fighter also gets a price reduction.
1712000	1716000	And a localized version of WALL-E, the video game on PlayStation 3.
1717000	1718000	That would be the Disney movie, WALL-E.
1719000	1724000	On the Wii, Cooking Mama, Mina to Isho ni Oryoi Takai.
1724000	1728000	It's just a price reduction. Fancy name for Cooking Mama 2.
1729000	1732000	Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, the Wii edition comes out this week, as does Facebreaker.
1733000	1736000	And Major Wii and Samba de Amigo comes out as well.
1737000	1742000	Taiko no Tatujin also gets a Wii release, and I know we have some Taiko fans from the music game folks.
1743000	1748000	Also, Dark Sakura, are you listening? December 11th, Japan.
1749000	1751000	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Cross Generation of Heroes comes out.
1751000	1756000	So you might want to be looking into imports pretty soon.
1757000	1762000	On the PlayStation 2, Galaxy Angel 2 gets a price reduction.
1763000	1768000	But, you know what? I think most of our listeners are probably going to be looking for Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4.
1769000	1770000	Call it a hunch.
1771000	1773000	Oh no! I'm sorry, that's the US release. My bad.
1775000	1778000	Sometimes some US dates sneak into my list here. My bad.
1778000	1781000	Well, I have dates for our UK people.
1782000	1783000	Wait, DS, real quick.
1784000	1787000	Elibits this week. And a game called Penguin. No Bondai.
1788000	1789000	Okay, I'm done.
1790000	1791000	No, that's it.
1792000	1793000	No, I'm done.
1794000	1795000	Are you sure? Are you positive?
1796000	1797000	Okay.
1798000	1799000	And Wall-E.
1800000	1801000	On the DS.
1802000	1805000	Ferret! Return the ferret. I command thee.
1805000	1807000	I command thee.
1808000	1811000	You do need to put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it you can yank it back.
1812000	1813000	It's a bungee ferret.
1814000	1815000	Not that I should be encouraging you to do this.
1816000	1817000	Thank you for...
1818000	1821000	You know, there was a totally random conversation that we had yesterday.
1822000	1823000	It didn't involve ferrets?
1824000	1825000	No, it didn't involve ferrets. It involved small animals.
1826000	1831000	We were talking about that they should breathe like micro monkeys and call them, like, monkeys.
1832000	1833000	That would be funny.
1833000	1837000	I don't know where that came from. We were at a really boring Christmas party at my dad's house.
1838000	1842000	We're out of alcohol. Let's eat sugar and brainstorm.
1844000	1845000	You know what they need to do?
1846000	1853000	Wait, since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and all this good Xbox Live thing, shouldn't they have a game called Bungee Ferret Tossing?
1854000	1856000	It could be like Orange Lawns Radio presents Bungee Ferret Tossing.
1857000	1859000	Add this to the list of Orange Lawns Radio Dream Games.
1859000	1862000	No, add this to the list of Orange Lawns Radio Reality Games.
1863000	1865000	We need to tell Mikey about the Dream Games.
1866000	1867000	We need to learn how to program or something.
1868000	1870000	We have a series of games that we're mostly developing.
1871000	1872000	Take a class on programming.
1873000	1874000	Learn it!
1875000	1876000	Absorb via osmosis.
1877000	1878000	You can learn it.
1879000	1880000	Anyhow, sorry.
1881000	1882000	You're a towel.
1883000	1884000	UK dates, please.
1884000	1889000	11th, Luminous Supernova on PlayStation 3. That makes me go squee and get happy in places.
1890000	1892000	On the 12th, some stuff.
1893000	1895000	Prince of Persia for PC, the Magic Roundabout.
1896000	1900000	For people in America who don't know what a roundabout is, Traffic Circle.
1901000	1902000	I have to translate.
1903000	1905000	Things I fucking hate when I'm driving downtown.
1906000	1907000	Dude, I fucking love them.
1907000	1915000	I love them. Because at my college we had one and it was big and had a park in it and my friends swore up and down that demons live there.
1916000	1918000	I'm not joking.
1919000	1921000	You're the most random fucking person on the planet sometimes.
1922000	1923000	I'm not joking.
1924000	1927000	Demons were living in the roundabout and this has what to do with video gaming?
1928000	1929000	The Magic Roundabout!
1930000	1931000	They're magic!
1931000	1938000	I do miss that...
1939000	1940000	Rob is red.
1941000	1942000	This show sucks.
1943000	1944000	You suck!
1946000	1949000	Laughter is warm and we're not.
1950000	1954000	One thing we forgot to mention, the studio is freezing cold tonight.
1955000	1957000	Keep in mind, we're Californians and we're pretty spoiled.
1957000	1961000	So I'm sure this is nothing. This is a summer day in Alaska right now.
1962000	1964000	But we are freezing cold in here right now.
1965000	1967000	So just wanted to get that out there.
1968000	1969000	So if we seem kind of cracked out, we are.
1970000	1972000	And also coming out, Your Mom the Game. Done.
1976000	1981000	Well, hopefully Your Mom the Game lasts longer than Mirror's Edge.
1982000	1983000	Longer than the player.
1983000	1988000	Loki. Sorry. Save our show.
1989000	1996000	I was looking at, there was a game I used to play that I thought, it's not roundabout, but it sounded just like it.
1997000	2000000	And it was, I was just trying to find a name for it.
2001000	2009000	It used to be called, the one that came over here was Felony 179, but it might actually have been called roundabout in the UK or something.
2009000	2012000	Really fun game where you break stuff with cars.
2013000	2018000	Yeah, so another thing that's totally on topic with breaking stuff with cars.
2019000	2023000	Mama is gardening now. Yes, gardening Mama.
2024000	2028000	Yet another thing that they're trying to get guys to play.
2029000	2032000	First they get them cooking and then they get them planting stuff in the garden.
2033000	2035000	Wait a minute, this is some type of secret plot, isn't it?
2035000	2038000	To get men to do the things that women are supposed to be doing.
2039000	2041000	What's next? Laundry Mama?
2042000	2043000	I will not stand for it.
2044000	2045000	Don't worry, Mama will wash it.
2048000	2055000	The next one was, what was it, not Pet City Mama. It has nothing to do with pets though. Pet Shop Mama.
2056000	2057000	Poop Scoop Mama?
2057000	2065000	I don't know, see I understand the whole gardening thing because people grow fruits and vegetables in their garden and they can use them to cook.
2066000	2071000	The Pet Shop Mama, I don't like where that's going. I don't like associating the pet shop with food.
2072000	2075000	But food is delicious and some pets are tasty.
2076000	2084000	That is a little strange that Cooking Mama will work in the pet shop part time and then she cooks things and PETA has a problem with it the other half of the time. Just saying.
2084000	2086000	Okay, that PETA thing was bullshit.
2087000	2089000	That's right, you were gone when all that went down.
2090000	2092000	Oh, no, remember I posted on my Twitter.
2093000	2094000	That was the week we were all off, was the PETA thing.
2095000	2096000	I posted on my Twitter about this.
2097000	2101000	And I think we talked about it briefly last week on the show and I was like, ah, if Jamie was here she'd say it's bullshit.
2101000	2114000	It's bullshit! Fuck you, PETA. My pre-emptive F you goes to PETA, may you get fucked with a steak.
2117000	2122000	A big, bloody cow rib.
2123000	2126000	We're really mature here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2126000	2132000	Okay, she really just said go fuck yourself with a steak. Am I not mistaking?
2133000	2135000	No, no, no, no, no.
2136000	2138000	With ribs.
2139000	2140000	Ribs.
2141000	2142000	Amazing.
2143000	2149000	Hey, we have some local news here. You know, sometimes we make the news with some things that go on locally.
2150000	2154000	And you know the game America's Army? Have you heard of the game America's Army?
2154000	2155000	Yes.
2156000	2160000	It's kind of a game that the Army put out to, you know, kind of be like other first person shooters, quote unquote.
2161000	2163000	Although I would hope the violence isn't quite as glorified.
2164000	2168000	But it's kind of a recruitment tool for the Army, America's Army, obviously.
2169000	2170000	You know, the game is free to play.
2171000	2174000	And it's a fairly popular game, you know, because it's, again, pretty old.
2175000	2177000	It's pretty old, too. I mean, the last game that they put out sucked.
2177000	2184000	Well, get this. Right here in Rancho Cordova, where we tape our show, a suburb of Sacramento, where the OLR Studios is,
2185000	2189000	not even that far from where we tape, only like one exit up the freeway,
2190000	2194000	there was a U.S. Army video game tournament for the game America's Army that happened right here in our neck of the woods.
2195000	2199000	Apparently, there were protests that ended up making the news here locally.
2200000	2203000	Some Veterans for Peace were out there actually protesting, and they have some pictures.
2203000	2207000	And this guy is holding the sign saying, real war is hell, don't enlist.
2208000	2212000	And the guy who is the president of this organization, John C. Reiger, the Sacramento branch,
2213000	2219000	he said, it's like giving candy to kids. It's sort of like military pedophilia, in a way, preying on our young people.
2221000	2225000	He really did use that phrase, military pedophilia. That's the quote he used, not me.
2226000	2227000	So, there you go.
2227000	2233000	And kind of the counter quote there was from Victor Ferrer, who is a sergeant in the Army.
2234000	2238000	He said, the event is nothing more than an opportunity for people to become familiar with the Army.
2239000	2242000	They also wanted to clarify the tournament was open to players 17 and over.
2243000	2247000	Anyone under 17 had to have a parent or guardian there in order to compete in the tournament.
2248000	2249000	And sign up for the military.
2250000	2251000	If we had known it was going on, we would have gone out there.
2252000	2253000	No, I would not have.
2254000	2255000	I would have played.
2255000	2258000	I don't think people think of Orange Lounge Radio when they think of America's Army, the game.
2259000	2260000	They think of the O.L. Army.
2261000	2264000	Usually not the type of game we cover, but I would have gone out there just to kind of check it out.
2265000	2266000	Did you see what SSG100Matt said in the chatroom?
2267000	2268000	No.
2269000	2270000	The winner of the tournament gets to go to Iraq.
2271000	2276000	So, it's like a twisted version of, you know, what the hell was that?
2277000	2280000	God, why am I drawing a blank no? 80s movie.
2281000	2282000	Last Starfighter. Sorry.
2282000	2284000	Dude, The Last Starfighter was awesome.
2285000	2286000	Yes, it's like The Last Starfighter, just more death.
2287000	2293000	I've got a friend of mine in Iraq right now, and I would not want anyone to go over there, so.
2294000	2299000	And to go back to what I was talking about when she was mentioning Roundabout, or Roundabouts or whatever.
2300000	2301000	Roundabout.
2302000	2309000	Yes, Roundabouts. Well, the game I was thinking was called Runabout, and it was, yeah, the U.S. title was Felony 1179.
2309000	2316000	Fun game. I got a bus stuck in a subway tunnel in that game, and it spun out of control until it took off like a helicopter.
2317000	2320000	Not to say that the game was, you know, glitchy or anything.
2321000	2322000	Good times. Good times.
2323000	2324000	How about some more gaming news?
2325000	2326000	Do I gotta?
2327000	2328000	You gotta.
2329000	2332000	Well, this is actually some pretty good news for all of our Suicoden fans.
2333000	2334000	We are getting a...
2335000	2336000	All 108 of you.
2336000	2338000	108 of you. There's a joke there.
2339000	2340000	See if you can spot it.
2341000	2344000	I haven't even played the damn game, and I get the joke. Thanks to Shane, thank you.
2345000	2354000	But for all of our friends in Europe, Suicoden, I guess it's pronounced T-Christ, is coming out on the DS in March next year.
2354000	2365000	And basically the game is, you start off as this unnamed person who's in a security force who has to recruit 108 heroes to battle the one king.
2366000	2381000	And you have a four-person party, and it's Suicoden, and you can go over the Wi-Fi to send characters into different games or other worlds so they can get new items, different quests, meet new people.
2381000	2389000	And this one actually just came out in Japan, and we here in America are supposed to be getting it in February.
2392000	2395000	But sorry, people in Europe, you've gotta wait. Or import!
2396000	2400000	But it should be noted, this is not like your typical Suicoden game. It's more of a tactical-type game.
2401000	2402000	Yeah, it's more tactics.
2403000	2404000	They call it a community RPG.
2405000	2407000	So it's really a mini men online role-playing girls game.
2408000	2409000	Hmm.
2409000	2410000	Interesting.
2411000	2412000	With tactics!
2413000	2414000	And stuff.
2415000	2421000	Speaking of stuff, Atari has announced a brand new game that they're working on with Tetsuya Mizuguchi.
2422000	2425000	It's a music game with the working title QJ.
2425000	2443000	And of course, you know, their Q Entertainment is known for their games that kind of blend in pretty cool musical aspects to it, so making, I don't know, a musical game is not necessarily a bad thing and not really unexpected.
2444000	2451000	Something else to look forward to, I guess. I guess we'll find out a little bit more about this later on.
2451000	2454000	I would be more worried if it was called LLQJ.
2456000	2457000	Nice.
2458000	2460000	I've had sugar today, Rob.
2461000	2462000	And how?
2463000	2463000	And how?
2464000	2471000	Well hey, I'm all over this. You talk music, you talk Mizuguchi, Q Entertainment, you know I'm gonna check it out because I'm a whore for everything that man puts out.
2472000	2476000	So you know I'm excited about this one if I didn't already have everything that this is gonna be offering.
2476000	2480000	But Atari is going to be bundling several of Mizuguchi's games together.
2481000	2488000	Res HD, Luminous Live, and Every Extend Extra Extreme are all gonna be retailed together in one retail package.
2489000	2494000	It's gonna be called Q3, which is supposed to be some type of term meaning cubed, I guess. Whatever.
2495000	2499000	Or you could do San-Q-3-thank-you-three.
2500000	2501000	Oh that's a cute idea.
2502000	2504000	Because it was the same pun with QQQ?
2504000	2505000	Okay.
2505000	2506000	San-Q-thank-you.
2507000	2508000	I get it, I get it.
2508000	2512000	Well you can also do, I mean, you know, to the third power is cubing something, so.
2513000	2514000	Right, right.
2514000	2517000	But that's cute. Either way, I didn't even think of the San-Q thing. That's pretty cute.
2518000	2525000	But anyway, you know, I'm sure a lot of our listeners probably already downloaded these games, but this is good news for those that are the more casual Xbox 360 people that don't take it online.
2525000	2526000	I would get this.
2526000	2527000	Yeah, I mean.
2527000	2528000	Because we haven't downloaded all this yet.
2528000	2536000	And here's your perfect opportunity, because, you know, even though the, it's kind of repackaged of old material, you're talking about some really good old material.
2537000	2539000	It's ResHD, it's Luminous Live, it's Every Extent Extra Extreme.
2540000	2543000	And it's, it's mostly, the download content for Luminous is all a part of this too.
2544000	2545000	So it's all in one nice little package.
2546000	2547000	So, very cool.
2548000	2550000	Does it actually save any money, though, over downloading everything with points?
2551000	2554000	I don't think it's gonna save very much. I don't see a price point listed here.
2555000	2556000	Probably worth all the download content for, like, Luminous.
2556000	2561000	Yeah, with the download content included, I think this is actually a pretty good package deal.
2562000	2565000	I mean, it saves you time and effort, really, you know, if just that.
2566000	2567000	It's based on your hard drive if you're crunched, I guess.
2568000	2575000	Exactly. It's saving room, and it's, you know, putting, you know, and there's also people who, you know, may have an Xbox who may not necessarily have, like, an internet connection.
2576000	2580000	I know people who were like that, you know, who don't have it hooked up all the time.
2581000	2584000	It's a good way to, you know, get all the download content and not have to worry about it.
2584000	2585000	True, true.
2586000	2587000	So, that helps.
2588000	2597000	Well, I mean, there's no reason for me to get this, because I always bottled this shit the first day it came out, but I'm glad to see that there's enough faith in the product that they're giving it a retail release.
2598000	2604000	I mean, who would have thought, years ago when Rez was on Dreamcast, it was kind of a cult title? Like, not everybody really knew about it.
2605000	2610000	Who knew that it would be kind of resurfacing in the mainstream again today, if that makes any sense? I don't know.
2610000	2613000	I kind of wish they'd do a true sequel to Rez. Wouldn't that be hot?
2614000	2616000	Well, yeah, that would actually be pretty cool, I think.
2617000	2618000	We'll see.
2619000	2620000	Well, how about some other stuff?
2621000	2624000	How about something that's gonna make my soul hurt?
2625000	2627000	But the soul still burns.
2628000	2635000	No, my soul isn't burning, it's fucking freezing and throwing up in the bathroom like a bad vodka hangover.
2636000	2637000	Okay, it's not that cold in here.
2637000	2640000	No, I'm not talking about in here, I'm talking about the King of Fighters movie.
2641000	2642000	King of Fighters movie?
2643000	2652000	Um, they are already, Gordon Chan is directing it. There's not too many details, but they're sad.
2653000	2656000	And this is basically what was put out saying about it.
2657000	2662000	It looks like the King of Fighters movie will introduce a new science fiction spin into the setting.
2662000	2668000	That right there is enough to make me vomit. It's enough to make my heart work.
2669000	2670000	Fighters in space!
2671000	2675000	Pretty much that's it. They're supposed to be going to different dimensions and different worlds.
2676000	2679000	Um, hi, the story works like it did before, don't fuck with it!
2680000	2686000	They're all stuck in, like, the Neo Geo world. They have to go to different games and destroy the characters and that.
2687000	2690000	It's like the crap they tried to do with the last Mortal Kombat movie?
2690000	2693000	No! Don't ruin my movie, please!
2694000	2699000	King of Fighters was like a classic staple in fighting games for me.
2700000	2706000	I mean, I grew as a gamer when King of Fighters came out and expanded my mental universe.
2707000	2712000	And made me realize that, yes, SNK can do a good fighting game other than Samurai Shodown.
2712000	2721000	And what kind of cherished childhood memory would it be if they didn't come and rape it later on in movie form?
2722000	2725000	Well, at least it's not being directed by Uwe Boll, so that's good.
2726000	2729000	Well, I'm glad I have something to be thankful for this holiday season.
2730000	2735000	But the stars of the movie are Maggie Q, Sean Ferris, William Lee, and Ray Park.
2736000	2736000	Who?
2737000	2737000	Wait, Ray Park!
2738000	2738000	Darth Maul!
2739000	2739000	Darth Maul, yes.
2740000	2740000	And Seth Rogen.
2740000	2741000	And what?
2742000	2742000	And Toad!
2743000	2744000	Toad, yeah.
2745000	2747000	Do you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad?
2748000	2750000	Same thing that happens to everything else.
2751000	2753000	It was awesome when Storm said it!
2754000	2755000	No, it wasn't!
2756000	2757000	Actually, it wasn't. It really, really wasn't.
2758000	2764000	Okay, do not get this couch started on Halle Berry and how much ass she sucks.
2765000	2767000	Oh, but Jamie Catwoman! No, wait.
2767000	2772000	I've blocked that out of my memory. It does not exist as a part of my universe.
2773000	2777000	Hey, it could be worse, okay? They could have had Tyra Banks play the part or something like that.
2778000	2780000	Tyra Banks has more personality, thank you.
2781000	2783000	She would have brought the much needed sass to the part.
2784000	2787000	She would have brought the sass and she would have brought...she just would have brought it.
2788000	2790000	When Angela Bassett declined, it was over. I mean, really.
2790000	2799000	But you know, Angela Bassett, I do agree to an extent that she was...she's done an X-Men movie ten years ago.
2800000	2803000	She was Storm. That would have been it.
2804000	2806000	But ten years ago, she was Tina Turner.
2807000	2808000	That's true.
2809000	2811000	If anyone can pull off the legs, then, you know.
2812000	2813000	Well, anyway.
2814000	2817000	Okay, sorry. When I'm singing Tina Turner songs, it's really time for us to get back to gaming news.
2817000	2820000	Is it? Yes. Let's talk about Activision.
2821000	2823000	We've been putting that in an uncomfortable place.
2824000	2827000	Something I'm completely used to by now.
2828000	2833000	So, Activision. They have a lot of brand new stuff coming next year, including...
2834000	2839000	Oh, gosh. What would it be without another Call of Duty game?
2840000	2843000	Yes, there's another Call of Duty game coming out next year.
2843000	2850000	It will hit Fall 2009, and apparently it's going to be back in Infinity Ward's hands again, so we can stop bitching about it.
2851000	2856000	And then also, they're going to be doing a brand new Bond game, because, well...
2857000	2860000	It's another franchise that they have to pump out one new game a year.
2861000	2866000	And then finally, they're going to do something a little different with the next Tony Hawk game,
2867000	2869000	which apparently is going to not be played with a controller,
2869000	2877000	and will be a game that you're not going to be playing with a controller in your hands, according to them.
2878000	2882000	And of course, what everybody's been speculating, the rumors have been around for a long time now,
2883000	2885000	that it's going to be actually some sort of motion-controlled skateboard thing.
2886000	2888000	Which, at that point, I have to ask...
2889000	2891000	Why don't you just go skateboard, then?
2892000	2894000	If you're not actually going to be playing with a controller, just go skateboard.
2894000	2898000	I mean, you're almost there anyways, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper.
2899000	2901000	The air conditioning. Carpet.
2903000	2907000	I know. But still. Skateboarding.
2908000	2911000	I mean, once you get to the point where it's so much like the thing that you're doing,
2912000	2915000	that you're actually doing it, you might as well just go actually do the sport.
2916000	2921000	And I'm sure this forgot to mention that they're probably going to be pumping out like four more Guitar Hero games,
2921000	2925000	because, you know, they haven't buried that into the ground enough yet.
2926000	2931000	Oh, and Bizarre Creations. You may remember them from the Project Gotham Racing series.
2932000	2938000	They're actually working on another racing game as well that's going to be racing and driving focused.
2939000	2941000	You know, because that would be any other racing game.
2943000	2949000	And they're also working on one that's going to be similar to Mario Kart meets Forza.
2949000	2952000	What the hell? Mario Kart meets Forza?
2953000	2959000	Maybe it's like a Mario Kart type of game, but you actually tune your karts and like what weapons and stuff are on it and that kind of thing.
2960000	2962000	How about a cute Forza game? That would be cute.
2963000	2964000	They already got Coral Q.
2965000	2968000	You know, if you want your Q race, the Coral Q franchise.
2969000	2973000	Did you see that they're actually putting out, and I don't know why they've done this over here,
2974000	2975000	apparently EA doesn't know how to make games for the Wii,
2975000	2986000	but they've decided that the next best idea to bringing NASCAR to the Wii instead of actually, I don't know, bringing NASCAR to the Wii is NASCAR Karts.
2987000	2988000	What?
2989000	2990000	Yeah, it's like Mario Kart with NASCAR drivers.
2991000	2992000	What?
2993000	2994000	Yup.
2995000	2996000	Interesting.
2997000	3000000	That's what EA thinks of you Wii owners. You're just little kids that don't know any better.
3000000	3006000	They won't give you any serious games, except for Boom Blocks. That's not really that serious.
3007000	3009000	That's sad.
3010000	3017000	Well, while Loki was reading us that last little story there, I actually was working on my portal that lets us peer inside Dark Sakura's alternate universe.
3018000	3019000	What?
3020000	3024000	So I actually have a clip from Dark Sakura's alternate universe where Tyra Banks is Storm.
3024000	3029000	In fact, I'm going to show you how fantastic my underwear make me feel!
3029000	3045000	I really feel crazy standing up here in my underwear. I'm used to doing this on a, you know, a Victoria's Secret runway or in a catalog, but not on the Tyra show.
3045000	3067000	So I need a little help. Everybody, on the count of 1, 2, 3, I want you to lose those under-the-canopy robes right now. Free that underwear everybody!
3067000	3096000	This is too much tire for this show, only the best part is coming up, lord, it's a panty

4380000	4385000	Someone stole the Metroid, and she had to go back after her baby.
4386000	4389000	Same as this jellyfish-looking baby.
4395000	4399000	Digitized voice for Super Nintendo, hi!
4401000	4403000	Anyway.
4403000	4416000	I'm not sure if this game is sexy or not, but I think it's funny that the Metroid producer was busy working on the Virtual Boy at the time and didn't have much involvement with this.
4416000	4423000	But this is a game that I'll get Dan to play, and I'll just sit back on the couch going,
4423000	4426000	Go this way, go that way, go this way, go that way.
4426000	4429000	That's really freaking cool. You're better at this than I am.
4429000	4436000	Let me know my thoughts on this game. I love this game more than most other games.
4436000	4440000	Pretty much any other game. I love this game so much. I think it's, you know.
4440000	4446000	I've already been caught up in the controversy about how much I love this game. I won't repeat it, but let's just say I love this game.
4446000	4452000	This game is electronic mookie. So, um, what?
4452000	4455000	It is! It is sex and pixels. It really is.
4455000	4457000	Without being dirty.
4457000	4464000	Of course, we all know that this game has been the big influence for the current series of Castlevania games.
4464000	4470000	You know, with that same type of map system running all over the place shooting stuff, except using a whip.
4470000	4479000	It also is one of, it's actually stated in my resource that it was a contributor to the speedrun phenomenon.
4479000	4487000	Because you did actually, for beating the game in different ways, you got different rewards, different things.
4487000	4493000	You can speedrun through Super Metroid like a mofo if you know where you're going and what you're doing.
4493000	4500000	I've seen this game beaten in person on a major speedrun, and it was beautiful.
4500000	4505000	So, it's really awesome-tastic.
4505000	4509000	Super Metroid game of the week.
4509000	4515000	You have to get it to the point where it plays the theme.
4515000	4519000	I think it's just going to start the first level.
4519000	4521000	Here we go.
4521000	4523000	Right?
4523000	4526000	Yeah.
4526000	4528000	I love this game.
4528000	4531000	I do love this game. I want to play this game right now!
4531000	4535000	The music in this game was freaking fantastic.
4535000	4537000	It really was.
4537000	4547000	You know what the Nintendo Sound Processor was eventually what was incorporated, if I'm right, it's what led to the one in the PlayStation.
4547000	4550000	Because Sony made Nintendo Sound Processor.
4550000	4558000	You know, I really just want to say, because we do have some younger folks who listen to this show who weren't a teenager or junior high or whatever when this game first came out.
4558000	4564000	Really owe it to yourself to check out this game. This is gaming at some of its greatest.
4564000	4570000	And as much crap as I've given the whole Chrono Trigger vs. Super Metroid thing that came up totally unnecessarily months ago on this show.
4570000	4576000	Play Chrono Trigger 2. I mean, they're both wonderful games, but I love Super Metroid so much.
4576000	4588000	See, if they were smart they would just go back and do, remember the same treatment that they basically did with Wario Land Shake It, just do that for Super Metroid or just a Metroid game.
4588000	4592000	Make a really awesome looking 2D Metroid game.
4592000	4594000	And not on the DS.
4594000	4596000	And not on the DS.
4596000	4606000	I mean, seriously, no one's going to care if it's a 2D game. No one's not going to buy your game just because, oh it's 2D, I don't want to play a 2D game.
4606000	4610000	Well, you know what, people will play a 2D game and they will like it.
4610000	4613000	Look at a game like Braid, you can still do awesome things in 2D.
4613000	4616000	Look at Castlevania games, they sell hotcakes on the DS.
4616000	4622000	And they would sell hotcakes on the Wii if they put out a really cool looking 2D Castlevania game.
4622000	4629000	You don't have to go all 3D, just make it fun, make it exciting, that's all you have to do.
4629000	4635000	Alright, well we are going to go, hey you know that Metroid Zero game, even though it was on the Game Boy Advance, was pretty awesome.
4635000	4639000	Like that was a great, like, successor in a way to Super Metroid, if that makes sense.
4639000	4645000	And they revisited the original Metroid but changed just enough that it really felt all new again, which I thought was kind of awesome.
4645000	4648000	So, there you go.
4648000	4652000	It's open, I'm just now seeing though that our time might have run out on him.
4652000	4655000	Whoops! We'll see.
4655000	4660000	I'm curious if the Skype line is going to work tonight or if I'm late.
4660000	4665000	Today was the day it runs out, so we may or may not be able to get calls tonight.
4665000	4668000	1877-GAME-OLR.
4668000	4672000	I'm going to try calling it myself real fast and see if it works.
4672000	4679000	We have a call, oh that call is coming in on Skype though.
4679000	4682000	GAME-OLR.
4682000	4685000	Let me see if it works, I'm calling it myself.
4685000	4690000	Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I do this live on air test that's very professional?
4690000	4691000	Yes.
4691000	4695000	Real quick stuff, just confirming a lot of the rumors that we had from a couple weeks ago.
4695000	4699000	Uncharted 2, Among Thieves, was announced.
4699000	4704000	Remember that thing that supposedly leaked out from Sony saying that there was a new Uncharted game?
4704000	4709000	Well, apparently it's true, so I wonder if the rest of it will be true as well.
4709000	4716000	Another big game that we should have mentioned during the show, but Killzone 2 finally got a release date.
4716000	4718000	February 27th.
4718000	4725000	If there's ever going to be an epic first person shooter game for the PS3, it's definitely Killzone 2.
4725000	4730000	They're kind of Gears of War if you want to look at it that way.
4730000	4737000	Kind of interesting, someone's bringing Catan to the PS3 as well.
4737000	4739000	Game Republic is bringing out that game.
4739000	4742000	It's actually going to be a different version that was on the 360.
4742000	4744000	Kind of like this one better.
4744000	4747000	No word on when that's going to be out though.
4747000	4751000	There's also a brand new game that's been announced by Fifth Cell,
4751000	4757000	the developer that put out that game, Drawn to Life, and also Lock's Quest.
4757000	4760000	It's going to be a little bit similar to Drawn to Life.
4760000	4763000	What it is, is it's actually an action puzzler game,
4763000	4769000	and you can type in words, or you write in words,
4769000	4773000	and it will create objects for you based on what you write in.
4773000	4777000	So for example, you have to collect these stars throughout the game,
4777000	4780000	and you can write in ladder, and a ladder will spawn.
4780000	4783000	You can climb the ladder to get the star, or you write in football,
4783000	4786000	and you can throw a football at the tree, or beaver,
4786000	4788000	and the beaver will chew down the tree.
4788000	4793000	Apparently there's such an enormous dictionary of words in this game,
4793000	4795000	you can literally put whatever you want.
4795000	4802000	I mean, just from ordinary objects to the most obscure thing you can think of.
4802000	4807000	And they promise apparently sharks with lasers on their heads.
4807000	4812000	So that's kind of neat.
4812000	4817000	And then finally, I'd like to mention that apparently,
4817000	4823000	according to YYR in chat, he is having a contest.
4823000	4825000	Oh, I was going to read this.
4825000	4826000	Well, fine, you go ahead and read this.
4826000	4827000	No, go ahead.
4827000	4828000	No, no, no, go ahead.
4828000	4829000	No, no, go ahead.
4829000	4830000	Okay, I will say this.
4830000	4832000	The contest actually doesn't start until Tuesday.
4832000	4836000	We're giving you a sneak peek right here, Snake 360 contest.
4836000	4841000	And you can win, or there's $450 in prizes to be given away.
4841000	4844000	And they have three different challenges,
4844000	4848000	Race to Fanatic, Survivor Challenge, and Battle Video Exhibition.
4848000	4851000	And of course, different prizes.
4851000	4857000	Looks like the prizes for each category include either 4,000 points card,
4857000	4861000	or one year of live.
4861000	4864000	Lots of stuff being given away, so that's kind of cool.
4864000	4871000	And apparently, the contest starts on Tuesday, ends on Sunday, January 11th.
4871000	4873000	And we can really say, and truthfully say,
4873000	4877000	you heard it here first, because Aaron, the author of the game,
4877000	4879000	just put this up and sent us a message first,
4879000	4881000	because we had him on our show a couple weeks ago,
4881000	4882000	and he hasn't forgotten about us.
4882000	4884000	Awesome guy.
4884000	4885000	Thank you very much.
4885000	4887000	And I don't know if we're automatically ineligible,
4887000	4892000	but I'm thinking the Battle Video might actually be kind of fun to try.
4892000	4893000	We might have to do that.
4893000	4894000	I don't know.
4894000	4895000	So we'll see.
4895000	4896000	All right.
4896000	4898000	The Skype line, the number is not working tonight,
4898000	4900000	but you can still call us via Skype, actual Skype.
4900000	4902000	Our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
4902000	4904000	I saw at least one call trying to come through earlier,
4904000	4906000	which I will take if it comes in again.
4906000	4908000	Otherwise, sorry kids, you have to be on actual Skype tonight.
4908000	4910000	But the Skype line is open at Orange Launch Radio.
4910000	4913000	Did you have anything else you want to add real quick?
4913000	4919000	Well, no.
4919000	4920000	Wow, all right.
4920000	4921000	I was looking to see if I had any more stories.
4921000	4923000	I do.
4923000	4926000	They had a, what is it, Half-Life remake called Black Mesa
4926000	4929000	that they released a trailer video for last week right after the show.
4929000	4931000	It looks so amazing.
4931000	4933000	It's using the source engine.
4933000	4936000	It's basically just a remake of the first Half-Life game.
4936000	4937000	That sounds pretty fun.
4937000	4938000	It was pretty cool.
4938000	4942000	And then, of course, Gran Turismo 5 apparently is on track for Holiday 09.
4942000	4944000	Funny because I thought that was supposed to be out this year,
4944000	4947000	but, you know, hey, I guess it's still on track to come out someday.
4947000	4948000	So is home.
4948000	4949000	Hey, we got a call.
4949000	4950000	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4950000	4951000	What is this?
4951000	4953000	Hello, Orange Launch Radio Land.
4953000	4954000	Apparently I'm very special tonight,
4954000	4958000	and the one voice of the crowd or something like that.
4958000	4960000	Are you the only one wanting to call in tonight in chat?
4960000	4961000	I don't know.
4961000	4963000	You were saying something that only one person called,
4963000	4964000	and I know I called.
4964000	4966000	Well, no, as one person was trying to get through,
4966000	4967000	I was doing all those tests,
4967000	4970000	but stupid me, the Skype number expired today,
4970000	4972000	and I got so busy I just never renewed it.
4972000	4974000	Are you going to be able to get the same one back,
4974000	4976000	or am I going to have to update what the toll free goes to?
4976000	4978000	No, we'll be able to get the same number back.
4978000	4979000	I'm not worried about that.
4979000	4980000	I'm going to wait for 90 days,
4980000	4982000	because I've let it expire before.
4982000	4983000	Live radio, folks.
4983000	4984000	One radio.
4984000	4985000	Yeah, I know.
4985000	4986000	You know what's funny?
4986000	4987000	That's the charm of Orange Launch Radio.
4987000	4989000	Kind of on the same old note there,
4989000	4993000	GoDaddy's been emailing me like a bitch to get me to renew O-L-R-E,
4993000	4995000	and I was like, oh, I'm just going to let it expire.
4995000	4999000	They automatically renewed it for me and charged me the money.
4999000	5000000	Oh, nice.
5000000	5003000	I think the E3 site we had also,
5003000	5005000	I think that finally actually expired,
5005000	5006000	because we never did anything with it.
5006000	5007000	Oh, my goodness.
5007000	5008000	Anyway, I do want to say real quick,
5008000	5009000	sorry, Jason, interrupt,
5009000	5013000	but we never gave the damn website for the Snake 360 contest,
5013000	5014000	because we're bad hosts.
5014000	5017000	www.snake360.com slash contest,
5017000	5020000	where you can see all the information about it,
5020000	5022000	and it's a great community game.
5022000	5023000	Check it out.
5023000	5024000	Jason, what were you calling about tonight?
5024000	5026000	Sorry.
5026000	5029000	When DJ Hero and all that stuff was kind of coming up,
5029000	5032000	I was just kind of going around looking for information,
5032000	5036000	and I pulled up a Kotaku post about it with the first notes on it,
5036000	5041000	and the picture of it reminded me of a story that I don't believe I've told on here.
5041000	5044000	Before I get into that, I was just going to kind of ask,
5044000	5048000	there's been a screenshot that makes DJ Hero look like Guitar Hero
5048000	5051000	with a DJ floating next to the chart,
5051000	5055000	but we don't really know anything about the game itself for the controller, do we?
5055000	5057000	There were some rumors about the controller a while back.
5057000	5059000	Wasn't the controller supposed to be like a giant turntable
5059000	5061000	with kind of like buttons around it or something like that?
5061000	5063000	I seem to remember there was a story a couple,
5063000	5066000	yeah, something like, it's not going to look like Beatmania.
5066000	5068000	That's for sure.
5068000	5070000	That's a common misconception about it is that,
5070000	5072000	oh, well, they're going to rip off Beatmania.
5072000	5075000	No, it doesn't look like they really want to go for that exact same game.
5075000	5077000	It's going to be different, it looks like.
5077000	5079000	Guitars and drums can't exactly be made original
5079000	5082000	when they're supposed to be guitars and drums,
5082000	5085000	but DJ decks have a lot of liberty to play with.
5085000	5088000	So the Kotaku entry that I was talking about,
5088000	5090000	you know that Joystick and Kotaku and everybody else
5090000	5093000	picks a featured picture that I've been,
5093000	5099000	that my Mario Kart code has been so greatly featured on three years ago.
5099000	5102000	They have this little actual DJ pioneer deck
5102000	5105000	that reminded me of something I saw at Best Buy.
5105000	5108000	Our Best Buy opened up a musical instruments corner of the building,
5108000	5110000	and when we were there the last time,
5110000	5113000	we kind of poked our heads in there and were killing some time.
5113000	5117000	They had a bunch of drum kits, digital drum kits laid out.
5117000	5125000	They had drawers of DJ kits with full-size digital turntable decks, I guess,
5125000	5129000	and little miniature turntable decks with the crossfader and the,
5129000	5131000	if there's a specific name for the centerpiece,
5131000	5134000	far be it for me to know what it's called.
5134000	5136000	But I was sitting there and I was kind of playing around with it
5136000	5139000	and I was thinking to myself, you know, this is really cool.
5139000	5140000	This is actually kind of fun.
5140000	5146000	You have the full-size LP deck with a little slot reader on the side
5146000	5150000	to stick your CD in and then do the same things you would do with vinyls.
5150000	5152000	Whether that's better or not, I leave that to the purists.
5152000	5159000	Anyways, I'm kind of looking forward to seeing more with what comes about with DJ Hero.
5159000	5162000	I think we are all on pins and needles about DJ Hero, Jason,
5162000	5164000	but the sad thing is I don't think we're going to see it until E3.
5164000	5167000	I think it's going to be Activision's big thing at E3 next year
5167000	5170000	because with Guitar Hero, we know that shit.
5170000	5172000	They say, new Guitar Hero game. We're like, whoopty shit.
5172000	5174000	We know what this is all about.
5174000	5177000	DJ Hero is going to be real new, you know what I mean?
5177000	5182000	Yeah, and you can draw the parallels to everything you want that's already come out.
5182000	5184000	B-Mania and Crackin' DJ.
5184000	5187000	I seem to remember there was something even more obscure that I can't think of.
5187000	5193000	Crackin' DJ was fun and all, but it just wasn't a real deck besides...
5193000	5195000	Okay, it was two turntables and a crossfader.
5195000	5197000	Two turntables and a microphone.
5197000	5199000	But none of the effectors, none of the volumes, none of that.
5199000	5205000	I'll also remember this, Jason. 98% of gamers haven't played any of those games you just mentioned, too.
5205000	5208000	But DJ Hero really has the potential to kind of...
5208000	5210000	The foot is already in the door, so to speak.
5210000	5212000	Because the same thing could have been said for Guitar Hero.
5212000	5215000	It's going to get shelf space right next to Guitar Hero.
5215000	5217000	Which is a big shelf.
5217000	5221000	Think about how really huge Guitar Hero's gotten.
5221000	5227000	I was watching a commercial for Best Buy the other day where they were talking about...
5227000	5230000	They were trying to do some type of like, oh, it's your hometown electronics store.
5230000	5234000	And they were talking about Killeen, Texas, which is funny because it's making me think of Travis from Understation Live.
5234000	5238000	But they were talking about Texas, and they were talking about like, oh, it's a big military base.
5238000	5242000	And this guy was talking about, oh, and you know, sometimes women will come in here and want to know,
5242000	5245000	where's that guitar game for my husband who's been away?
5245000	5247000	And I'm thinking like, wow.
5247000	5249000	That really just kind of put it into perspective.
5249000	5256000	It really has kind of crossed over now into that guitar game that every family has to have, if that makes sense.
5256000	5261000	That's because they picked music that people actually know and care about to some extent.
5261000	5268000	But DJ Hero is going to have a huge foot in the door because of the mainstream success of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, really.
5268000	5269000	Yeah.
5269000	5274000	And the fact that they're actually going for names like T.S.O. and anybody else that they're going to sign and announce later on down the line.
5274000	5279000	Who would have thunk it when we started this show a few years ago that music games would become so huge, huh?
5279000	5282000	Especially after we moved away from just music games.
5282000	5285000	Well, that's what did it.
5285000	5290000	Remember there was no new DDR for like years and years and literally two weeks after we said,
5290000	5293000	oh, we're going to move away from the music game things and talk about general gaming.
5293000	5294000	Supernova!
5294000	5295000	Supernova is coming out.
5295000	5296000	We're back!
5296000	5297000	Yeah, yeah.
5297000	5298000	Bastards.
5298000	5299000	All right.
5299000	5300000	Anyway.
5300000	5301000	Konami exists to spite you.
5301000	5303000	Konami does exist to spite us sometimes.
5303000	5305000	I really truly believe that.
5305000	5314000	I think the most interesting part about all this is the Guitar Hero arcade machine, arcade cabinets that was talked about a few weeks back.
5314000	5315000	Yeah.
5315000	5324000	And just the fact that they can do, especially with the fact that Guitar Hero itself went World Tour and the fact that apparently Konami is working with Activision for the cabinets.
5324000	5329000	If that didn't just signal Rock Revolution's death that we already knew was coming, what does?
5329000	5342000	But just the fact that World Tour exists and DJ Hero was acquired by Activision, should I say Freestyle Games was acquired by Activision who was making DJ Hero.
5342000	5354000	The big linked performance games that we always wanted out of DDR, 2DX, Guitar Freaks, Drummania, and optionally Keyboardmania, but that died pretty quick,
5354000	5361000	can actually come stateside, stateside music, and possibly do a lot for arcades for all we know.
5361000	5363000	That would be freaking expensive though.
5363000	5366000	You know, I said this a long time ago on the show and I truly believe it.
5366000	5372000	You know, Harmonix and these developers were willing to take the risk that Konami wasn't and look where it got them.
5372000	5386000	And Konami should be kicking their own ass right now and if they didn't have the, if there weren't patent laws and all that stuff so that they could essentially ride the coattails now of someone else's success from their idea, which is odd, there wouldn't be a lot going for them right now in the music game world.
5386000	5393000	As much as we can hate on them for filing those lawsuits, the fact that they're working together for an arcade machine is kind of redeeming.
5393000	5399000	I want to quickly say this comment, Jason, before we let you go, get your reaction to this. Tiger Claw in chat says,
5399000	5404000	If you want to play your own version of DJ Hero, you can download a DJ mixing program on your PC and mix your own MP3s.
5404000	5408000	But that's boring because that's not telling me how to do it.
5408000	5410000	I can't play without arrows on the screen.
5410000	5413000	There's no arrows to step on. Or whatever.
5413000	5417000	Alright, Jason, we gotta let you go to get a couple more calls, but you have a good one, buddy.
5417000	5419000	Giant dork fest!
5419000	5422000	Alright, yeah, that's the show. Alright, later dude.
5422000	5424000	Night, guys.
5452000	5455000	At first you told me there was no mailbag, now you're telling me there's a mailbag.
5455000	5456000	I didn't think we'd have time.
5456000	5460000	Alright, well, we'll do it. Since no one else is calling on Skype, we'll close Skype.
5460000	5469000	You know what, we need to actually have theme music for the Skype thing, and we need to play Bananaphone.
5469000	5473000	You know what's funny? That was the fortune cookie message last week, when you weren't here, yes.
5473000	5475000	How funny.
5475000	5479000	Alright, yeah, I thought Rama was calling in to give a review on something. Where is he?
5479000	5485000	Oh, because he's on the phone. Oops. Sorry, Rama. Love you.
5485000	5488000	But we love the mailbag, too!
5488000	5493000	Mailbag. OrangeLunchRadio.com, which apparently we are doing this segment tonight, although I only saw one email in there when I went in earlier.
5493000	5495000	Saw us send an email.
5495000	5500000	Hello, OLR buddies and friends. It's actually titled Why Hello There, OLR.
5500000	5504000	I finally joined the new millennium and got an Xbox 360.
5504000	5513000	I've survived solely on DS and PSP for the longest time, and I have to say that it's nice to have a non-portable gaming system again for the first time in nearly three years.
5513000	5520000	So far, I only have Guitar Hero 3 and Guitar Hero Aerosmith. My band's names are Spock's Eyebrows and Doodly Ladies, respectively.
5520000	5526000	But I hope to remedy this soon. What are some good Xbox 360 games that I should look into purchasing?
5526000	5529000	Fable!
5529000	5534000	Fable 2 is kind of evil, but it is definitely entertaining. You can beat up chickens.
5534000	5539000	Please go on Xbox Live Arcade and look at all the sex that's on there, like Rez.
5539000	5540000	Symphony of the Night?
5540000	5544000	If you don't already have that on PlayStation 1, definitely Symphony of the Night.
5544000	5551000	Go look at how much sex is available for cheap on Xbox Live Arcade. That's where you need to go.
5551000	5562000	And, um, oh shoot, there's also, um, there's of course the Rock Band series, and, um, Brainfart.
5562000	5564000	Brainfart the game!
5564000	5565000	Guitar Hero?
5565000	5567000	She already said she had them!
5567000	5568000	Oh yeah.
5568000	5569000	Okay.
5569000	5577000	So, moving forward, since Jamie mentioned playing Order of Ecclesia, I figured I would quickly plug the review I did of that game.
5577000	5583000	It's great! And can be found on my blog at www.avengerstower.com.
5583000	5585000	The game is great, or the review is great?
5585000	5586000	Both.
5586000	5594000	Order of Ecclesia is definitely a very difficult game compared to earlier Castlevania games, but the difficulty of the game most certainly adds to the fun.
5594000	5602000	Anyway, OLR, take care of yourselves, and I'll quite possibly see you soon, as soon as next year, perhaps, eyebrow waggle.
5602000	5603000	Sincerely, Martin.
5603000	5605000	Take care of yourself and each other.
5605000	5610000	Real quick, and, you know, this kind of goes back to something we were talking about way earlier in the show.
5610000	5621000	Kunamata, that was on your release dates for coming out in the Asia regions, well, it's already been out in the Asia regions, but this is the English slash Chinese version.
5621000	5625000	So, you could import this and play it in English.
5625000	5628000	Thought about it, it's only $49.90.
5628000	5630000	It's not bad.
5630000	5633000	Can't run over the animals, though, that is a downside.
5633000	5634000	Dope.
5634000	5638000	We have more.
5638000	5639000	All right, let's hear more.
5639000	5641000	One of them tricked me!
5641000	5644000	It said love, love, love, love, love, and I thought it was about me, but it was spam.
5644000	5646000	Bastards.
5646000	5647000	I hate those spammers.
5647000	5649000	You know he should have F-ed?
5649000	5651000	The one who stole your magnet off your car.
5651000	5653000	Oh, I forgot about that.
5653000	5660000	I had a rainbow all of his divine magnet on my car, and somebody stole it.
5660000	5663000	Oh, it's on the fridge right now.
5663000	5664000	Pissed me off.
5664000	5665000	Ugh.
5665000	5666000	Pissed me off.
5666000	5667000	That's so messed up.
5667000	5668000	Moving forward.
5668000	5669000	Damn thieves!
5669000	5670000	Bastards!
5670000	5672000	I can't make a fist.
5672000	5673000	This sucks.
5673000	5678000	Okay, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act of theft.
5678000	5683000	A few weeks ago, I got Tales of Vesperia, and it's a pretty good game.
5683000	5684000	I recommend it.
5684000	5685000	Can I point out where we live?
5685000	5687000	There's lots of friendly neighborhood Mexicans.
5687000	5688000	Actually, lots and lots.
5688000	5689000	Just wanted to say.
5689000	5692000	But he's an actual, in Mexico, Mexican.
5692000	5693000	Alright, fair enough.
5693000	5695000	And that makes him special.
5695000	5699000	But that's not what I want to talk about.
5699000	5704000	I want to comment about how I got it for a cheaper price than it would have cost in the
5704000	5707000	US, and what's curious about this is that I got it for full price.
5707000	5712000	Most games when sold in Mexico are ridiculously overpriced because of stupid import handling
5712000	5716000	taxes, and to top it all off, most stores charge you even more and make games pretty
5716000	5718000	much an expensive thing to invest in.
5718000	5725000	Except for those, like me, who live next to the US and can cross the border to buy stuff.
5725000	5730000	With the most recent global economy crisis, the Mexican peso has lost its gain to the
5730000	5731000	US dollar.
5731000	5734000	But for gaming, it has meant a good thing rather than bad.
5734000	5740000	When I bought Tales of Vesperia, I bought it for 7.55 pesos, which is the MSRP price
5740000	5741000	for it down here.
5741000	5744000	Now, a dollar is worth 13.50 pesos, approximately.
5744000	5749000	So doing the math, I sold the game and cost the equivalent of $55 US total.
5749000	5753000	That's a savings of $5 US without added sales tax.
5753000	5758000	I marveled myself on how this crisis has caused at least one good thing.
5758000	5761000	Another example is Gears of War 2, which is a newer game.
5761000	5766000	In the US, it costs $60, while in Mexico, it costs around 650 pesos.
5766000	5771000	Again, doing the math, the game's cost in Mexico is the equivalent of $47, approximately,
5771000	5773000	$13 in savings.
5773000	5776000	And there are other games that would cost less here than crossing the border.
5776000	5781000	Unfortunately, there are other games that still do cost more here than in the US, but
5781000	5786000	like I said, it's because of store making up prices rather than giving us the real retail
5786000	5787000	price.
5787000	5790000	Especially on Playstation and Nintendo games, since they don't have a real representation
5790000	5794000	in Mexico or Latin America, unlike Microsoft, which does have it.
5794000	5797000	Oh well, that's all for now.
5797000	5803000	Kinda happy news in all this crisis stuff.
5803000	5807000	Sorry to Jamie who reads this email if there are any grammatical or spelling errors in
5807000	5808000	it.
5808000	5810000	You know what?
5810000	5817000	You have better grammar and spelling than most people in America do.
5817000	5820000	Yeah, when you consider that English is not this gentleman's first language, from what
5820000	5821000	I understand.
5821000	5823000	I believe he said before Spanish is the native language.
5823000	5824000	You're my freaking hero today.
5824000	5826000	There you go.
5826000	5829000	A very rare commendation from dark soccer.
5829000	5831000	You don't get that very often in the mailbag statement.
5831000	5832000	Look at you.
5832000	5834000	Wear that badge with honor, my friend.
5834000	5840000	We also got an email forwarded to us.
5840000	5842000	There's a very long email in there.
5842000	5843000	It is a very long email.
5843000	5846000	Email a statement for next week.
5846000	5852000	But it was sent by one of our All Games listeners through All Games Radio.
5852000	5859000	And I'll tell you what, because of the length of this and because it is actually a well
5859000	5862000	thought out question, I'm going to post it on the forum.
5862000	5864000	Well, they wanted us to talk about it on the show.
5864000	5865000	There was some question in there.
5865000	5868000	Look for a really short paragraph towards the bottom.
5868000	5869000	I'm trying to remember what it was about.
5869000	5874000	What might be your thoughts regarding you as the consumer using LittleBigPlanet as an
5874000	5876000	advertising self-promoting marketing tool?
5876000	5879000	Okay, let me give you the gist of the email because it is kind of long for air, but I
5879000	5880000	did read it off air.
5880000	5885000	Basically, the emailer was wondering, he was listening to some other shows in All Games
5885000	5889000	and this kind of crossed his mind and wanted to hear our take on it because I guess he's
5889000	5890000	been pulling some different shows.
5890000	5892000	I'm glad I didn't put it on the forum then.
5892000	5894000	No, it's a good question.
5894000	5901000	LittleBigPlanet has this potential to be like a new medium for all this marketing.
5901000	5906000	What's the potential for it or where do you see people using it?
5906000	5910000	What do you think people could be using LittleBigPlanet for with all the marketing?
5910000	5916000	To me, I kind of think, well, in a way, it's a little big planet I kind of compare to a
5916000	5917000	new website.
5917000	5918000	Does that make sense?
5918000	5921000	Like a YouTube or iTunes or something.
5921000	5924000	I guess iTunes is really a website, but you know what I mean?
5924000	5930000	If there is a way to sell your product on it, there will be people that want to do that.
5930000	5934000	It is the quote unquote American way after all, even though we have a worldwide audience.
5934000	5935000	You know what I mean?
5935000	5937000	Capitalism is big all over the world.
5937000	5939000	Look at a site like YouTube.
5939000	5940000	You have tons of people.
5940000	5941000	At first, what was YouTube?
5941000	5944000	YouTube was a way to pirate TVs and commercials.
5944000	5948000	When they had to legitimize themselves, it became this really interesting way to kind
5948000	5950000	of sell music and all this other stuff.
5950000	5951000	iTunes.
5951000	5952000	Podcasting.
5952000	5958000	When we signed up to do podcasting, it was people like us in their garages, in their
5958000	5961000	basements with microphones talking about shit they liked.
5961000	5967000	Now it's hugely commercialized, and we're having a hard time staying afloat amongst
5967000	5968000	all these.
5968000	5971000	I mean, we'll be here doing our thing for a long, long time, but we have a hard time
5971000	5976000	getting recognized because you have all these commercial people out trying to tie it into
5976000	5982000	their website, their TV shows, their TV networks that have very little to do with gaming, but
5982000	5985000	they have video game podcasts anyways, and so on.
5985000	5988000	Is that the truth?
5988000	5994000	It's very interesting that where there's a way, people will kind of sell it, and it's
5994000	5996000	interesting that this email comes in.
5996000	6001000	Probably before, you have LittleBigPlanet talking about now that there's going to be
6001000	6005000	the Luminous thing, and I think there was a big misconception this week that there was
6005000	6007000	actually going to be a Luminous game inside LittleBigPlanet.
6007000	6008000	That's not quite the case.
6008000	6011000	It's that there's a LittleBigPlanet skin coming to Luminous.
6011000	6015000	Come to think of it, it really doesn't have anything to do with the whole thing you're
6015000	6019000	talking about at all, except for the fact that where there is a way to tie it in to
6019000	6025000	market something in a video game, it can be done, and I bet you for sure there's going
6025000	6030000	to be people that go out there and try to sell their website, their band.
6030000	6031000	True story.
6031000	6036000	I was playing Warcraft the other night, and there was a shout in one of the villages.
6036000	6038000	I'm not even kidding.
6038000	6043000	If you live in, I think it was Boston, if you live in Boston, come check out this show
6043000	6046000	on Saturday night if you like this metal band.
6046000	6052000	I'm like, dude, how many people in this world of Warcraft might live in Boston?
6052000	6055000	Boston's a pretty big place.
6055000	6058000	I know it's a big place, but World of Warcraft is a really fucking big place.
6058000	6060000	It's like 100 Bostons.
6060000	6068000	Do you remember in Animal Crossing when we could do the message in a bottle thing, and
6068000	6070000	we could send them out to random people?
6070000	6071000	Yes.
6071000	6079000	And I put in our radio station there and was sending out bottles like freaking mad.
6079000	6081000	That's pretty much us doing the same thing.
6081000	6083000	And something that's also not in the Wii version anymore.
6083000	6085000	Thank you very much, Nintendo.
6085000	6086000	Very true, very true.
6086000	6088000	I didn't even think about that, but you're right.
6088000	6091000	People have been using video games to promote their shit for a long time.
6091000	6096000	But we could actually have all of our villagers say orangestonesradio.com, and then when they
6096000	6100000	move to other people's villages, they'll spread.
6100000	6102000	Okay, so the question was about LittleBigPlanet, though.
6102000	6104000	But LittleBigPlanet makes it easy.
6104000	6107000	I'm surprised there is no OLR level on LittleBigPlanet yet.
6107000	6108000	There probably ought to be.
6108000	6109000	I should probably get to work on that.
6109000	6111000	We should have a contest.
6111000	6118000	But it's also against the terms of service on LittleBigPlanet to promote websites using
6118000	6119000	levels in the game.
6119000	6120000	Oh, jeez.
6120000	6121000	Yeah, seriously.
6121000	6122000	What if you do it discreetly?
6122000	6127000	Because, look, Bobby has a level from the beta, and he does it discreetly.
6127000	6130000	He does it, he promotes it without...
6130000	6134000	And, granted, I don't think he put a lot of effort into level.
6134000	6138000	I think it was his way of exploring the game and being able to give the game a good review.
6138000	6142000	I don't think he ever kind of intended it to be the one and only thing he ever does.
6142000	6147000	But he invested a fair amount of time into it, but he kind of did a real easy-ish type
6147000	6152000	of level that kind of slyly worked in a plug for his show.
6152000	6155000	I think as long as you're not crazy about it, I bet they wouldn't have it.
6155000	6160000	They were actually promoting a LittleBigPlanet fan community on there, and it got pulled.
6160000	6162000	Why is that so weird?
6162000	6163000	Yeah, it is stupid.
6163000	6166000	They're getting a little stupid with that stuff.
6166000	6168000	What are you laughing at over there?
6168000	6174000	A picture that I got sent for the cover of Wolverine and Power Pack, number three.
6174000	6178000	Well, look, to go back to the email, definitely where there's a way to do it, people are going
6178000	6180000	to do it.
6180000	6186000	It's just a matter of time, but it's kind of interesting to see the moderation and how
6186000	6189000	that's going to play into it, because it was very hard to moderate Animal Crossing.
6189000	6194000	I mean, look at the N-word snuck through on one of those cartridges.
6194000	6199000	Anyhow, I guess that's it for our show then.
6199000	6200000	Was that the last email too?
6200000	6202000	It was indeed.
6202000	6203000	All right.
6203000	6207000	Last email tonight, and if you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com.
6207000	6208000	We're done.
6208000	6209000	We're ready to get out of here.
6209000	6211000	We've got the final thoughts tonight.
6211000	6212000	Oh.
6212000	6213000	Yeah.
6213000	6215000	Never mind, because it comes after.
6215000	6216000	Okay.
6216000	6217000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
6217000	6223000	I'm looking at this actual P90 tactical load-bearing vest, which is kind of neat, because I would
6223000	6227000	work with my airsoft gun, even though it's meant for actual real guns.
6227000	6228000	All right.
6228000	6230000	DarkSakura, your final thought?
6230000	6233000	Deadpool's fucking funny.
6233000	6235000	My final thought is I'm fucking funny.
6235000	6236000	Duncan.
6236000	6237000	Shut up.
6237000	6239000	Beckers, thanks for joining us tonight.
6239000	6242000	I know you didn't get to talk a whole lot, but I'm glad you and Jamie got to sit there
6242000	6243000	in the corner and giggle like girls.
6243000	6244000	It was fun.
6244000	6245000	All right.
6245000	6247000	Do you have any final words for our listeners tonight?
6247000	6249000	It's freaking cold here.
6249000	6250000	It is cold here.
6250000	6251000	I'm sorry.
6251000	6252000	All right.
6252000	6253000	You should see what it's like in the summertime, though.
6253000	6255000	Trust me, this is better than the alternative.
6255000	6261000	But we need to have Becky on when we have stupid parent stories.
6261000	6262000	Oh, boy.
6262000	6265000	Because we definitely need to hear from someone.
6265000	6267000	Oh, thank you for reminding me.
6267000	6268000	What?
6268000	6270000	We didn't even mention that story.
6270000	6271000	Uh-oh.
6271000	6272000	What?
6272000	6273000	Hold on.
6273000	6274000	Hold on.
6274000	6275000	This is good.
6275000	6276000	This is good.
6276000	6279000	It was another game that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed.
6279000	6283000	Or another crime that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed for, and it had nothing to
6283000	6286000	do with Grand Theft Auto at all.
6286000	6292000	It had to do with children torturing animals.
6292000	6294000	Yes, that's right.
6294000	6303000	Apparently, the newest crime that Grand Theft Auto can get blamed for is hanging kittens
6303000	6307000	with game controller cords after playing Grand Theft Auto.
6307000	6316000	Apparently, a pair of unsupervised boys, six and seven years old, stoned a kitten and then
6316000	6319000	strung it up following a Grand Theft Auto session.
6319000	6322000	They reportedly used the controller cable in lieu of a rope.
6322000	6326000	And you're not talking about blowing the bong smoke in the kitty's face.
6326000	6327000	No, no.
6327000	6328000	Oh, god, that's terrible.
6328000	6329000	No.
6329000	6336000	Apparently, this happened in late October in Mesa, Arizona, and it says the investigation
6336000	6340000	began when deputies went to the neighborhood of one of the two boys and found the kitten
6340000	6342000	hanging by its neck from a backyard tree.
6342000	6345000	The boys had apparently used the wire for the video game controller they were playing
6345000	6347000	Grand Theft Auto to hoist up the kitten.
6347000	6350000	The animal's head had been injured by blows from rocks.
6350000	6354000	You know, I'm thinking this goes a little bit beyond video games.
6354000	6360000	I'm thinking these kids are just really, really, really, really, really fucked up.
6360000	6361000	Hold on.
6361000	6369000	But the county sheriff actually said, so one question, or what was it?
6369000	6371000	Who is this guy?
6371000	6372000	Arpeo.
6372000	6376000	I'm not sure if it's the boys' parents or something.
6376000	6380000	It says, this game allows players to kill cops and rape women.
6380000	6385000	It's a little wonder why they perpetrated such violence against the little animal.
6385000	6388000	YYR in our chat, it says the parents are to blame.
6388000	6393000	They should have bought wireless controllers.
6393000	6394000	It doesn't matter.
6394000	6395000	They would have stoned it to death anyways.
6395000	6398000	Becker's just dying to say something.
6398000	6400000	Institutionalize your children.
6400000	6403000	They're going to grow up to be serial killers.
6403000	6408000	That has nothing to do with the video games.
6408000	6410000	This is coming from a mom.
6410000	6412000	Parents, this has nothing to do with video games.
6412000	6414000	This has everything to do with you.
6414000	6416000	Your genes did this.
6416000	6422000	Stop passing them on.
6422000	6430000	Your hell spawn, Damien Light, did this.
6430000	6433000	I agree with Becky, padded room.
6433000	6435000	Or just give them a hammer and leave them in a room by themselves.
6435000	6436000	Now can we end the show?
6436000	6437000	Can we end the show now?
6437000	6438000	No.
6438000	6441000	Thank you for ending the show on Dead Kittens, you ass.
6441000	6443000	Hey, I gotta go home and hug my kitty.
6443000	6444000	Okay, okay, okay.
6444000	6446000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6446000	6450000	I have one thing that will make it all better.
6450000	6451000	Cookies.
6451000	6452000	Yay, cookies.
6452000	6455000	And on that note, we're going to go eat some cookies and end the show.
6455000	6456000	Good night.
6456000	6458000	Oh, and by the way, if you enjoy Orange on Trio,
6458000	6460000	please tell two people you know about the program and help us spread the word,
6460000	6463000	because as I mentioned earlier, it's really hard to stay afloat
6463000	6465000	amongst all the commercialized and corporate shows out there.
6465000	6467000	Word of mouth, it rocks.
6467000	6469000	And you rock when you leave us happy reviews.
6469000	6473000	And join us for live shows on all games radio Sunday nights at 6 o'clock.
