14141	20697	Tonight, Tekken 6 gets a date, Rock Band is set to go a little bit country, and is Cooking Mama taking up a new hobby?
31792	36656	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36696	43202	We are that video game show dedicated to all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43242	44483	My name is Rob Roberts.
44863	48326	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48826	48926	Ah.
49887	50007	Ah.
51048	51168	Ah.
51208	51649	You're back.
51709	52209	Welcome back.
52690	53190	I am.
53510	53971	All right.
54031	56753	And what an amazing two weeks off it's been.
57013	57374	I know.
57454	57894	Don't rub it in.
57914	58354	Not really.
58374	59395	You've had all this time off.
59475	59936	No, I'm just kidding.
61303	64905	We are a little late tonight in starting the show.
64925	69306	This won't affect anybody listening to this on the podcast, except for the fact that podcasts have been going up extremely late lately.
69326	70447	That's because we're all pregnant.
70827	72648	But no, we're not all pregnant.
74829	77490	Let me introduce Tech Master Loki, who I hope is not pregnant.
77530	77870	Jesus.
78837	79758	Are you pregnant, Loki?
79939	80760	No, I am not.
81721	82663	Welcome, Tech Master Loki.
82683	90915	We're starting a little late tonight, 7 o'clock Pacific, just because there's personal life things going on that have to... Real life, greater than gaming.
90935	92036	Rob has PMS.
92317	93098	Yes, I have PMS.
93158	93699	I'm having a baby.
94980	95240	All right.
95600	97862	Also say hello to a special guest we have here tonight.
98062	101824	Jamie has brought one of her friends here to giggle with us tonight on the show.
102384	103265	Say hello to Becky.
103625	104165	Greetings.
104425	104665	Hello.
104686	106967	Do you have an online name you use, Becky, that you want people to call you?
107967	108348	Beckers.
108688	109148	Beckers.
109568	110049	I like that.
110489	111189	Beckers.
112090	113130	It makes me think of Beckham.
115225	115746	Alright, Beckers.
116948	118670	Anyhow... Yeah, but he married a hoochie.
119732	121395	Posh Spice is pretty hot.
121415	122076	It's a hoochie!
122376	122697	Whatever.
122977	125080	Anyway, Beckers... Her boobs don't move!
125201	126903	Beckers, what type of video games do you enjoy?
126943	127845	You play a lot of video games?
127865	128526	What do you like?
129141	130421	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
130461	130681	I refuse.
159514	159974	Refuse?
160054	160455	I'm kidding.
161395	162436	How dare you refuse?
162456	164077	I played some rock band.
165277	172121	I've been playing Castlevania Order of Ecclesia and I'm very pissed off at it right now so I took a break because it's fucking hard.
173842	174282	That is.
174702	175483	I have the same problem.
176243	181986	I'm going to actually go back and re-level just on that first thing just because it's such a pain in the butt.
182347	186549	And I got Animal Crossing and I have been beating my animals with the bug net.
188608	188868	Awesome.
189008	193610	But I accidentally stole my shovel and stupid Nook, that butthead, won't get anyone in.
194550	200272	You know, I was telling Nellie, because there's this one stupid rabbit in her town named Francine.
200712	201673	I know which one that is!
201713	203153	Yes, that she absolutely hates.
203173	212936	I said that we have to form a hit squad and just have everybody at Bug Nets all of a sudden chase her down, like, get her trapped in one of those pitfalls and just all four people hitting her at the same time.
213557	214637	That would be hilarious.
214657	216978	Do you know who fucking showed up in my village?
217258	217418	Who?
218083	219904	Pearl, I hate her.
220325	225268	She's a little cat that looks like, oh, God, she looks like she has, like, burn scars all over her face.
225288	226629	Yeah, she's in my village.
226850	227350	Wolfgang.
227790	228271	Oh, that's cool.
228291	229352	He's fucking awesome.
229392	233134	I can't believe we're having this discussion about a game made for 12-year-olds.
233555	234355	Guess what?
234375	236017	I got a bunny in my town.
236037	237738	I want the lesbian to move back into my town.
237938	238518	What was her name?
238559	239259	Was that Barbara?
239359	240720	No, Barbara was a sheep.
240780	244163	She was a duck, I think, and had gym equipment in her house.
244683	246605	So we put rainbow signs outside of her house.
248217	265385	and she was our we put all kinds of happy signs and sent her letters and the bitch moved out I mean if that is not you know you think you know somebody and you move in after a month I'm sorry that's you know she just got pissy and moved out
266831	270192	She probably moved in with her girlfriend after the second date, like most lesbians.
270553	271433	That's what I was thinking.
271453	276355	She moved out of my village because I got boring and wouldn't send her any more letters or peaches.
277295	279016	And she moved out.
279536	279776	Bitch.
280256	281317	Lesbians are so needy.
282137	282357	Anyhow.
283323	312809	and Dan's been playing Need for Speed Undercover and I've been mocking him because it's fun and easy and then even though it's not a video game I've been watching a lot of Supernatural which is more fun because I got to watch Jensen Ackles naked not completely but it was a lot more exciting than playing Animal Crossing
314035	317756	Remind me, this is a show geared towards 16-year-old girls?
317916	318496	Hell no!
319717	321497	It is geared towards me.
321677	323078	It's on the CW.
323878	324458	We forgive it.
324738	325058	All right.
325759	326999	Loki, how was your gaming week?
327439	328979	My gaming week was all right.
329420	333181	I watched my wife play a lot of Animal Crossing because I'm not allowed near it, I guess.
334616	334996	Thanks for watching!
352678	356520	and there was like a bunch of stuff that she's done.
356921	358762	She harasses her animals quite a bit.
359702	361883	Dude, do you know that now it censors things?
362063	364245	Like you can't just have your animals say fuck.
365205	369007	And like mine, I tried to get mine to say poop and it wouldn't say it.
369047	370388	It said that word is not allowed.
370548	371549	I have to tell you though.
371569	373010	So now he says poop.
373766	375527	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
395263	399085	One of the animals defaulted, their little catch word was the N word.
399285	399645	Yeah, yeah.
399885	403867	But the way they got around it was they put N and then an I with an accent.
403887	406148	Well, no, it was someone who, one of the programmers.
406168	406909	I know, I know.
408669	411191	Or they probably copied something to test it.
411211	414132	They copied Ranma, someone that had already played it and unlocked all the stuff.
414152	414832	That's what it was.
416073	420955	But yeah, they, I don't know, should maybe look at that first, you know, do a little testing.
421731	422334	Someone's getting fired.
428345	429766	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
459941	487009	I'm not sure but or 1400x900 not 1440 but it runs pretty good for me you know 40-50 frames per second and I have a lot of sliders put up all the way you know although I don't like the fact that this brand new game does not support SLI so that's kind of a waste and it's got to be patched in later on you know absolute laziness just to get it out
488393	489913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
516610	517150	It's fun.
517510	518050	It's hard.
518451	519591	You know, very, very hard.
519671	521531	You'll fall off a building a lot.
523152	526213	But I think people are pissed off because it's, you know, short.
528073	533555	And, you know, sure, I guess it doesn't innovate much, but the way I look at it is, is it fun?
533835	534135	Yes.
534735	536436	So then what are you complaining about?
538416	541417	But, yeah, I'll have to play some more of that.
541437	542897	I hear it is really short.
542977	545218	In fact, I believe, what was it, um,
547237	569101	Yotzi had reviewed it this week and man said he beat it in a day so it'll be interesting to see how long it takes me to finish it then I've got a bunch of other games on my plate in fact I got another one this week which I haven't even touched yet Prince of Persia so that looks pretty fun too so well lots of stuff
570273	570993	All right, good times.
571033	573414	Well, my gaming week's been Animal Crossing.
573434	576315	A couple weeks ago, I think I mentioned Animal Crossing, but didn't really get too far into it.
576715	579355	I really spent some serious time with Animal Crossing on the Wii this week.
579395	579836	And you know what?
580396	591899	As much as we're joking around and kind of talking about reliving the thrill of the GameCube version all over again, I have a real hard time recommending this game overall because it's just not enough new for me.
591959	596280	And I kind of feel like there's Animal Crossing on the GameCube out there for much cheaper prices.
596640	598021	and you almost get more in it.
598542	601344	But there are some cool things in this game.
601985	610431	The problem with this game is it feels like it's just a port of the DS version with a couple extra frills and it just kind of leaves an Animal Crossing fan really wanting more.
610912	615676	I think they should have taken more risks with this game than they did.
616036	618378	Although I will say the internet functionality works pretty cool.
618418	625864	They have worked WeConnect24 into it a little bit so you don't really have to go to somebody's village to send letters and things of that nature which is an improvement over the DS version but
626184	628325	I mean, is that really worth the whole new upgrade?
629106	629666	Not so much.
647556	648597	It doesn't really do a whole lot.
648617	652999	The city is for getting all of your special characters who only would randomly show up.
653019	656420	This is so you can have the convenience of having them all the damn time.
656921	658141	Yeah, I think that's stupid.
658201	660302	Then that takes away the special part of it.
660923	676270	No way, you still get presents floating on balloons, and you still get, you know, Gulliver, you know, showing up, and I'm actually, you know, Wild World didn't really hold me all that well, but this one's, I'm really digging it.
676707	677468	You know, it's weird.
677508	678628	I kind of feel the same way.
679289	681410	The DS one, I got really fast.
681430	685152	But for some reason, I have been actually going back to the Wii one to kind of see if there's new stuff.
685172	686093	But it's weird.
686353	690155	I say all this, yet I can't in good conscience really recommend this game.
690496	695038	You have to really be hardcore about these types of games to get a thrill out of this.
695178	697560	You have to really be an Animal Crossing fan, of which I was.
698060	699681	But I'm still left wanting more.
700662	702903	For me, it's my sit down for an hour and relax.
704504	704784	Seriously.
704804	705405	I got wowed.
707429	707689	Addict?
707709	708090	Rob What?
732928	738771	and the consensus overall amongst at least my guild, which is a casual raiding guild.
739131	741212	We were never very hardcore about the endgame.
741412	743913	It's all the people from Final Fantasy XI still.
743993	746174	A lot of the same people that were there have moved over here.
746354	748855	Even Glenn and some of these people from old school.
748915	751416	Yeah, we haven't seen them in a few weeks.
752857	753898	That would be the turkey coma.
755310	758598	But yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
758638	759540	We're rating ill.
759580	763068	The general consensus is this expansion is better than the last one.
763919	764879	Rob, can you help me power level?
792202	792842	I can try.
792862	795164	I have a level 20-something priest.
795184	798626	I've also been playing Ragnarok, and you can play that with me.
798926	799327	We'll see.
799447	801368	I've got a lot of games to play.
801548	802028	I know you do.
802248	804890	I can get you to level 100 in two hours.
806051	806711	I'm not joking.
807972	809193	Sky, your voice like that, not sexy.
829705	830446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
849403	850464	Yeah, you actually see him.
851304	852725	They did a much better job with this expansion.
852745	853745	I think they learned a lot from the last one.
853765	869314	See, that's the one thing I would really like to see in an MMO is that they have it function like an actual RPG where you have to do point A to point B to, you know, where your quests are not just, oh, look, this person has question mark over his head and I want...
869614	869914	Money!
869934	870054	Yeah.
891764	892804	It got really dull.
892824	894305	You might also be on the wrong server.
894365	896345	You should try a roleplay server on WoW.
896425	896985	You might have fun.
897085	899046	I was on a roleplay server, actually, and I didn't.
899706	900966	No one stays in character.
901947	902547	It's annoying.
902627	903907	I just rather hang out with everybody.
903927	909149	When you finally get the battle and defeat the Lich King, he'll be all, I have one last thing to say.
909729	915590	Don't forget Guitar Hero 5 pre-orders and StarCraft 2 is right around the corner.
915690	916190	Shut up.
917111	917811	You forgot Diablo 3.
918652	919293	Oh, and Diablo 3.
920756	921217	Warcraft 4.
921537	924743	I like how you tried to do your lazy bass echo.
925164	927127	Your Lich King sounds like a drunken asshole.
928427	931649	Hey, how much have you really gotten to know the Lich King yet?
931669	934151	Yes, DJ Tyrant hit the nail on the head.
934951	937533	The last expansion had nothing like Wrathgate.
937753	940935	He says Wrathgate is one of absolutely the best questlines of all time.
941075	942276	In-game cutscenes for the win.
942536	945137	They have cutscenes in the quest this time, and they're epic.
945778	947239	Epic cutscenes are very epic.
947659	949340	And Wrathgate was hot.
949440	955624	Everybody in our guild, because we're all WoW nerds, was having a gigantic orgasm over the Wrathgate questline because it was awesome.
956403	961787	See, that sounds like it would be more fun to me just having actual story to follow.
962107	965690	I don't want to spoil what happens in Wrathgate, but it's pretty amazing.
965810	966551	It's pretty epic.
966611	971694	You get to learn a little more about the phasing technology, and it's cool.
971915	972175	It's cool.
972635	974317	Bobbie Blackwolf Show
996616	997016	and DarkSakura.
1012688	1013989	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1029295	1035758	But it's actually going to be like they're going to do the interaction with the live crowd as well as the people in the chat room.
1036798	1037539	That sounds awesome.
1037879	1039479	They're going to have some neat co-hosts and stuff too.
1039560	1043121	So I don't know how much more I can say because I don't know what he said yet.
1043781	1044722	But it's going to be cool.
1045122	1046403	So listen to it.
1046583	1051725	FNGLive.net and that starts January 9th on All Games Radio.
1053433	1055234	Anyhow, that's really all the housekeeping I have tonight.
1055274	1058095	So how about some gaming news, even though it's been kind of a slow news week.
1058135	1060235	So a short show seems appropriate tonight.
1060295	1060936	Loki, what's up?
1062056	1068818	Well, there is a certain Kingdom Hearts game that's scheduled to come out for the DS, and you may have heard about it.
1069499	1076101	Kingdom Hearts 358 slash 2 days is going to be getting a North American release.
1076961	1079042	I mean, did anyone have...
1080157	1080538	KINGDOM HEARTS 3
1098075	1098315	Never.
1099595	1099876	I don't know.
1100596	1102256	They have to whore it enough.
1102596	1114380	Kingdom Hearts 2 you have to understand is like Final Fantasy 7 or the upcoming Final Fantasy 13 where it's got to have 90 billion versions for it first before they move on to the next one.
1114500	1115800	Then they can whore that one out.
1117281	1121242	Got to wear out the first prostitute first before they can move on to the next.
1123967	1127730	I still want my Kingdom Hearts 3, though, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1127770	1132474	That would be very nice, with my high-def graphics and hopefully a working camera.
1132895	1135597	But although Kingdom Hearts 2 wasn't bad, as far as the camera goes.
1135677	1137999	I thought Kingdom Hearts 2 was really solid.
1138380	1139661	Kingdom Hearts 2 is a very solid game.
1139781	1140181	Good time.
1140301	1142263	I need to actually not glitch mine out.
1142343	1143364	I miss games like that.
1144365	1145086	It's been a little while.
1145106	1146587	When did Kingdom Hearts 2 come out?
1147388	1146587	05?
1147408	1147668	06, maybe?
1148249	1148609	I think.
1148789	1148949	Maybe 06.
1150356	1155257	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some other news and some other games that are dated that are highly anticipated.
1155297	1157718	Probably another anticipated game by Jamie, Tekken 6.
1157918	1166060	It's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and it's been confirmed that it will be in the fall 2009 time frame.
1166860	1176083	So the Xbox 360 is supposed to, I don't know if it's getting a slightly earlier launch or something, but they're going to hit generally at the same time, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
1176123	1179384	This official announcement was made by Atari
1180144	1181886	who is publishing the game over in Europe.
1182627	1183128	There you have it.
1183769	1192899	So it's not going to be in the same time frame as like Street Fighter 4 and we know there's not going to be a new Mortal Kombat next year because they just had one this year.
1193320	1193480	So
1194379	1195139	Well, then, I don't know.
1195359	1197800	They were putting out those Mortal Kombat games a dime a dozen for a little bit.
1197820	1203062	They could still do another Mortal Kombat game because all they would really have to do is just port the engine over and add new characters.
1203142	1203762	Let's face it.
1204542	1209464	Mortal Kombat and Tekken have very, very different fan bases, so I don't think there's going to be any overlap there anyway.
1209984	1210184	Yeah.
1210424	1210904	Very cool.
1210944	1212345	Tekken 6 coming soon.
1213066	1214427	No mention about arcades, though.
1214787	1215088	Sad.
1216469	1217349	I weep for the arcade.
1217649	1219171	Really, where is the market going?
1219671	1220031	I know.
1220071	1221292	Well, they do have the arcade version.
1221352	1223073	It should be already out in Japan.
1223374	1223714	Yeah.
1223754	1224094	I think.
1224655	1226116	It's not coming over here.
1226636	1226796	WeWare
1254033	1254373	Alright.
1254954	1255414	WiiWare.
1255634	1256574	The stuff I'm boycotting.
1257335	1258576	Oh, come on, Rob.
1258716	1259016	True.
1259996	1260236	True.
1260417	1263638	They did promise that they'd have more storage, but where the fuck's the update?
1264119	1264979	Probably March.
1265159	1266400	That's just like Sony's Home.
1266480	1267921	Where the fuck is Sony's Home?
1268141	1270162	I can't play it, therefore it's not out yet.
1271483	1272163	Sorry, DarkSakura.
1272662	1279425	What can the more common folk, who are not stuck up enough to be boycotting the Nintendo Wii, what can they be playing?
1280565	1283486	There are more games coming out.
1283747	1294051	There's actually going to be ArtStyle Roto Hex, that's a remake of the Bit Generations game Dial Hex, that was on the Game Boy Advance.
1295151	1298072	That's actually going to be 600 Wii points.
1299093	1302734	Episode 4 of Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people on its way.
1303394	1306275	And it will have the Danger-esque 3 theme.
1307376	1308756	It's 1,000 Wii points.
1309156	1312637	I will allow you to get the Strong Bad game because it's pretty awesome.
1312657	1314618	But I do want to point out it's also available on PC.
1315158	1316779	If you don't want to put up with the Nintendo Wii.
1318259	1318740	Just saying.
1319560	1319840	That's all.
1321114	1328024	I want to know when the hell they're doing an art-style version of DotStream, because that was the most kick-ass bit-generation game that they released.
1328585	1331809	That and Sound Voyager, I guess, is supposed to be pretty good, but I never picked that one up.
1334209	1341792	Well, there's also Bang, which is a shape-matching game, and Pit Crew Panic, which should make sense.
1341852	1343513	It's mechanics for broken things.
1343733	1345213	That's the one where you fix toilets.
1345753	1347074	Remember, there's a giant toilet one.
1347094	1348715	Oh, that sounds like fun.
1349535	1351195	I think we talked about that a little bit.
1353237	1355598	Oblivion, Beatmania, and Kingdom Hearts 2 were all released the same week.
1377062	1379904	BlackWolf wants to point out that Strong Bad is also cheaper on the PC.
1380004	1380404	Good point.
1381845	1385027	And YYR in chat, I believe, is commenting on the Tekken 6 story.
1385487	1387789	The arcade version will not be released in North America.
1387849	1388829	They announced that a while back.
1388969	1389730	I don't remember when.
1389830	1391751	Selected arcades in the USA do have it.
1392311	1393312	There's like three in New York.
1393372	1393812	I've played it.
1393912	1394313	It rocks.
1394773	1397395	And there will be an upgrade called Bloodline Rebellion.
1397455	1399016	All of that from YYR.
1400288	1408194	I was going to mention, since we're on the topic of WiiWare, Xbox Live Arcade will be getting Meteos Wars and Power Up Forever this week as well.
1408354	1408654	Really?
1408795	1412257	I love Meteos, but I can't imagine not playing it with a stylus.
1414019	1421224	You know I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi through the good times, like Luminous, and the bad times, like 99 Nights.
1422165	1425908	I love that man, and I will get Meteos just because it's Q Entertainment.
1427388	1429092	I really liked the DS one.
1429112	1429914	It was kind of underrated.
1430515	1430956	Just saying.
1431297	1433783	But I can't imagine not playing that game without the stylus, that's all.
1436803	1438164	Yeah, sorry.
1439024	1439564	Let's see.
1439624	1441785	Well, other things that you can expect this week.
1442345	1445427	It's a very short list, unfortunately, because it is this time of year.
1446247	1448408	Most games have already been released for Christmas.
1448608	1453890	But there are a few late additions, including Prince of Persia on the PC.
1454090	1455331	Who's tardy to the party?
1455391	1457932	Who's stumbling in hungover to the Christmas party?
1458192	1460233	And Sonic Unleashed on PS3.
1460913	1463074	Both of those versions coming out later.
1463482	1464962	Neopets Puzzle Adventure Puzzle Quest
1492066	1494687	Just with Neopets, does anyone still play Neopets?
1495328	1499529	I was just talking about playing Neopets the other day because I miss playing the little games on the site.
1499549	1500290	But you weren't playing them.
1500310	1502111	Talking and doing are two different things though.
1504972	1505432	Let's see.
1505552	1509354	I was talking about Neopets the other day in the mall when I was walking by Claire's.
1509414	1510574	Do they have Claire's nationwide?
1510594	1511435	Is that a nationwide chain?
1511675	1516797	Okay, so then you all know, well, for the international audience, Claire's is like the pretty, pretty princess store.
1516817	1520199	It's the store for like 11-year-old girls who want to dress up like princesses.
1520979	1537485	and you can stop with the comments right now about how much I love Claire's but I was looking in the window not in the store but in the window and they had all these Neopets things for sale and I was telling my friend I remember when I used to play Neopets damn I needed a life so that's all and you don't now
1538345	1539306	Hey, watch it.
1540406	1543309	Core on DS, that'll be coming out.
1543949	1551975	Let's see, Hidden Expedition, Amazon, and The Tale of Despero, both on PC.
1553916	1561821	Other titles for this week, Slingo Quest on DS, Left Brain, Right Brain 2 on DS.
1562932	1568618	Driver's Ed Portable, yes, you can practice your Driver's Ed tests on the DS now.
1570380	1571120	Build the lot.
1573703	1576926	You can practice your, is it like just the written test on?
1577727	1579028	I think so.
1579529	1580690	That's, okay.
1581591	1583313	I practice driving on Ridge Racer.
1585301	1587644	Build a Lot, Ski and Shoot, Dungeon Maker 2, The Hidden War on PSP,
1601081	1611485	Kate West, The Vanishing Files on DS, and of course the big one for the week, Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 on PS2.
1612025	1615346	And that is the special edition that comes with the soundtrack.
1615626	1618427	Because Atlas is really hooking you up.
1618447	1618907	Freaking rad?
1620027	1620227	Yes.
1621588	1622008	Alright.
1622088	1624649	And I have to say that it's only going to get worse from here.
1627138	1627978	The next few weeks are crap.
1650896	1657406	Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts is going to be released over in Japan on December 11th as is Mirror's Edge in Japan on the Xbox 360.
1658307	1662434	Also being released December 11th on the PlayStation 3, Hakuna Matata!
1664453	1667295	That's actually a general Asia release.
1667315	1668916	Did that game ever get released here in the U.S.?
1669216	1675160	No, it's going to be released here under, I think Namco's doing it, under National Geographic Africa.
1676281	1677662	Wow, that's a better name.
1677702	1680184	Did that game get a facelift all of a sudden, didn't it?
1680304	1682385	Yeah, they're changing it up for here.
1682605	1684707	It's not coming over here for a while, though.
1685387	1687068	I want to see animals eating each other.
1687168	1690170	Well, Hakuna Matata gets the general Asia release.
1690210	1693633	It's an English-Chinese version, so you could import it, technically, December 11th.
1694173	1696675	But I want to see the monkeys throw poo and do it.
1696855	1701778	Or you can import the UK version, which I believe is in English and I think is already out.
1702158	1702818	Oh, there you go.
1703699	1707121	Mina No Golf 5 gets a price reduction this week, this Friday.
1707161	1708682	Mirror's Edge also comes to the PlayStation 3.
1709262	1711964	And Virtua Fighter also gets a price reduction.
1712624	1716026	And a localized version of WALL-E, the video game, on PlayStation 3.
1716907	1718848	That would be the Disney movie, WALL-E.
1719688	1724512	On the Wii, Cooking Mama, Minato Isho ni Aoyoi Takai.
1724672	1726093	It's just a price reduction.
1726494	1728395	Fancy name for Cooking Mama 2.
1728856	1731798	Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, the Wii edition, comes out this week.
1731818	1734240	It has this face breaker and major Wii.
1734500	1736942	And Samba de Amigo comes out as well.
1737343	1739164	Taiko no Tatsujin also gets a Wii release.
1739264	1742287	I know we have some Taiko fans from the music game folks.
1742767	1746170	Also, also, Dark Sakura, are you listening?
1746670	1747391	December 11th, Japan.
1747431	1747571	What?
1748672	1751614	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Cross Generation of Heroes comes out.
1752054	1756656	So you might want to be looking into imports pretty soon.
1757557	1762039	On the PlayStation 2, Galaxy Angel 2 gets a price reduction.
1762960	1763920	But you know what?
1764240	1769343	I think most of our listeners are probably going to be looking for Shimogami Tensei Persona 4.
1769703	1770304	Call it a hunch.
1770824	1771064	Oh no!
1771224	1772325	I'm sorry, that's the US release.
1772705	1773005	My bad.
1774906	1777147	Sometimes some US states sneak into my list here.
1777768	1778068	My bad.
1779215	1781956	Well, I have dates for our UK people.
1803689	1805830	Return the ferret, I command thee.
1805890	1807511	I will put it like on a bungee cord.
1807531	1811093	You do need to put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it, you can yank it back.
1811833	1812513	It's a bungee ferret.
1812533	1814214	Not that I should be encouraging you to do this.
1814794	1820777	Thank you for... You know, there was a totally random conversation that we had yesterday.
1820797	1821358	Uh-oh.
1821558	1822458	But did it involve ferrets?
1822578	1823599	No, it didn't involve ferrets.
1823719	1824719	It involved small animals.
1824959	1826320	We were talking about that they should... Wow.
1826360	1831162	We were talking about that they should breed like micro monkeys and call them like munkins.
1831463	1832063	That would be funny.
1832143	1832243	No.
1833516	1834398	I don't know where that came from.
1834439	1837266	We were at a really boring Christmas party at my dad's house.
1838590	1839933	We're out of alcohol.
1839953	1841898	Let's eat sugar and brainstorm.
1843892	1845272	Wait, you know what they need to do?
1845813	1853155	Wait, since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and all this good Xbox Live thing, shouldn't they have a game called Bungie Ferret Tossing?
1853935	1856376	It could be like Orange Launch Radio presents Bungie Ferret Tossing.
1856436	1859076	Add this to the list of Orange Launch Radio dream games.
1859757	1862977	No, add this to the list of Orange Launch Radio reality games.
1863118	1865098	We need to tell Becky about the dream games.
1865118	1867439	We need to learn how to program or something.
1867459	1869639	We have a series of games that we're mentally developing.
1869659	1870520	DarkSakura, you're in school.
1870560	1871560	Take a class on programming.
1872788	1873228	Learn it!
1873448	1876190	Absorb via osmosis.
1876550	1877231	You can learn it.
1878691	1879252	Anyhow, sorry.
1879452	1880172	You're a towel.
1882033	1882994	UK dates, please.
1883654	1886676	On the 11th, Luminous Supernova on PlayStation 3.
1886796	1889357	That makes me go squee and get happy in places.
1890138	1892099	On the 12th, some stuff.
1892679	1895281	Prince of Persia for PC, The Magic Roundabout.
1896361	1900684	For people in America who don't know what a roundabout is, Traffic Circle.
1902054	1902774	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1938817	1939558	Rob is red.
1939578	1941181	It's cute.
1941802	1942643	This show sucks.
1942924	1944226	You suck.
1946751	1948954	Laughter is warm, and we're not.
1950482	1951563	And also coming out, your mom the game.
1951583	1951663	Done.
1978479	1981124	Hopefully your mom the game lasts longer than Mirror's Edge.
1982446	1983227	Longer than the player.
1984650	1985071	Loki.
1985632	1985972	Sorry, I...
1988012	1989712	Thank you for watching!
2010563	2011244	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2026721	2029743	They're trying to get guys to play.
2029804	2032806	First they get them cooking and then they get them planting stuff in the garden.
2033647	2035848	Wait a minute, this is some type of secret plot, isn't it?
2035908	2038751	To get men to do the things that women are supposed to be doing.
2039091	2039691	What's next?
2040092	2040932	Laundry Mama?
2041753	2043935	No, actually... I will not stand for it.
2043955	2045216	Don't worry, Mama will wash it.
2047938	2050300	The next one was... What was it?
2051701	2052802	Not Pet City Mama.
2052922	2054283	It's something to do with pets, though.
2054343	2055144	Pet Shop Mama.
2056513	2057294	PoopScoopMama
2072734	2075236	But food is delicious, and some pets are tasty.
2075316	2084164	That is a little strange that Cooking Mama will work in the pet shop part-time, and then she cooks things, and PETA has a problem with it the other half of the time.
2084184	2084664	Just saying.
2085004	2087106	Okay, that PETA thing was bullshit.
2087126	2087907	That's right.
2087927	2089448	You were gone when all that went down.
2090369	2090989	Oh, no.
2091610	2092751	Remember I posted on my Twitter.
2092771	2094892	That was the week we were all off, was the PETA thing.
2094932	2096794	I posted on my Twitter about this.
2096854	2101498	And I think we talked about it briefly last week on the show, and I was like, if Jamie was here, she'd say it's bullshit.
2102446	2103826	It's bullshit!
2105707	2106567	Fuck you, PETA.
2107968	2111329	My preemptive F you goes to PETA.
2111849	2114030	May you get fucked with a steak.
2117331	2122053	A big, bloody, cow rib.
2123853	2126134	We're really mature here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2127170	2131335	Okay, Loki, did she really just said go fuck yourself with a steak?
2131435	2132717	Am I not mistaking?
2133438	2133979	I did hear that.
2133999	2135220	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2136161	2137983	With ribs.
2140505	2140925	R.I.B.B.S.
2167536	2169737	America's Army, obviously, you know, the game is free to play.
2170077	2175258	And it's a fairly popular game, you know, because it's, again... It's pretty old, too.
2175338	2177639	I mean, the last game that they put out sucked.
2177879	2178819	Well, get this.
2178999	2190222	Right here in Rancho Cordova, where we tape our show, a suburb of Sacramento, where the OLR Studios is, not even that far from where we tape, only like one exit up the freeway, there was a U.S.
2190342	2194923	Army video game tournament for the game America's Army that happened right here in our neck of the woods.
2195287	2196028	www.DarkSakura.com
2221860	2224123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
2242964	2247330	Anyone under 17 had to have a parent or guardian there in order to compete in the tournament.
2247510	2248351	And sign up for the milter.
2248511	2250834	If we had known it was going on, we would have gone out there.
2251635	2252536	No, I would not have.
2252737	2254439	I would have played.
2254819	2258003	I don't think people think of Orange Lounge Radio when they think of America's Army.
2258023	2259044	They think of the O.L.
2259125	2259305	Army.
2259625	2262265	Usually not the type of game we cover, but I would have gone out there.
2262506	2263786	Just to kind of check it out.
2263946	2265886	Did you see what SSJ100Matt said in the chat room?
2266406	2266586	No.
2266786	2268807	The winner of the tournament gets to go to Iraq.
2271067	2275808	So it's like a twisted version of, you know, what the hell was that?
2277168	2279188	God, why am I drawing a blank now?
2279608	2280049	80s movie.
2281129	2281929	Last Starfighter.
2282229	2283749	Dude, The Last Starfighter was awesome.
2283769	2286890	Yes, it's like The Last Starfighter, just more death.
2287570	2288410	I've got
2288846	2292987	A friend of mine in Iraq right now, and I would not want anyone to go over there.
2294568	2301010	And to go back to what I was talking about when she was mentioning Runabout, or Roundabout or whatever.
2301190	2301971	Yes, Roundabout.
2302151	2309573	Well, the game I was thinking was called Runabout, and it was, yeah, the US title was Felony 1179.
2310374	2310874	Fun game.
2311254	2316676	I got a bus stuck in a subway tunnel in that game, and it spun out of control until it took off like a helicopter.
2316696	2316776	Yeah.
2317768	2320691	Not to say that the game was glitchy or anything.
2321452	2322914	Good times, good times.
2323955	2325176	How about some more gaming news?
2325436	2325937	Do I gotta?
2326438	2326878	You gotta.
2327779	2332624	Well, this is actually some pretty good news for all of our Suikoden fans.
2333265	2333966	All 108 of you.
2338029	2338709	There's a joke there.
2339289	2339890	See if you can spot it.
2339930	2342650	I haven't even played the damn game and I get the joke.
2343051	2344331	Thanks to Shane, thank you.
2345351	2354394	But for all of our friends in Europe, Suiko Den, I guess it's pronounced T-Christ, is coming out on the DS in March next year.
2355174	2365478	And basically the game is, you start off as this unnamed person who's in a security force who has to recruit 108 heroes to battle the One King.
2365918	2366158	Ooh.
2366678	2389664	and you have a four person party and it's Suikoden and you can go over the Wi-Fi to send characters into different games or other worlds so they can get new items, different quests, meet new people and this one actually just came out in Japan and we here in America are supposed to be getting it in February.
2392605	2394226	But sorry people in Europe, you've got to wait.
2394786	2395246	Or import!
2395728	2396328	with tactics and stuff.
2414051	2414551	Thank you for watching!
2428007	2457613	of course you know their Q Entertainment is known for their games that kind of blend in you know pretty cool musical aspects to it so making I don't know a musical game it's not necessarily a bad thing and not really unexpected something else to look forward to I guess I guess we'll find out a little bit more about this later on I would be more worried if it was called LLQJ nice
2458860	2460081	I've had sugar today, Rob.
2461962	2462382	And how.
2463103	2463683	And how.
2464204	2465384	Well, hey, I'm all over this.
2465645	2468667	You talk music, you talk Mizuguchi, Q Entertainment.
2468687	2471689	You know I'm going to check it out because I'm a whore for everything that man puts out.
2472546	2476809	So you know I'm excited about this one if I didn't already have everything that this is going to be offering.
2477270	2481553	But Atari is going to be bundling several of Mizuguchi's games together.
2481933	2489478	Res HD, Luminous Live, and Every Extend to Extra Extreme are all going to be retailed together in one retail package.
2490039	2495563	It's going to be called Q3, which is supposed to be some type of term meaning cubed, I guess, whatever.
2496824	2499506	Or you could do San Q3, thank you.
2500486	2501467	Oh, that's a cute idea.
2501647	2504509	Because it was the same pun with QQQ.
2505209	2505669	Okay.
2505730	2507411	SonQ, thank you.
2507651	2508431	I get it, I get it.
2508451	2512774	Well, you can also do, I mean, you know, the third power is Q being something, so.
2513294	2513574	Right, right.
2514155	2514655	But that's cute.
2514915	2516776	Either way, I didn't even think of the SonQ thing.
2516796	2517357	That's pretty cute.
2517897	2525221	But anyway, you know, I'm sure a lot of our listeners probably already downloaded these games, but this is good news for those that are the more casual Xbox 360 people that don't take it online.
2525241	2525962	I would get this.
2525982	2527643	Yeah, I mean... Because we haven't downloaded all this yet.
2527783	2529564	Then here's your perfect opportunity, because...
2529744	2530784	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2551381	2552702	I don't think it's going to save very much.
2552742	2553923	I don't see a price point listed here.
2553943	2555985	Probably worth all the download content for Loomis.
2556085	2561009	Yeah, with the download content included, I think this is actually a pretty good package deal.
2561089	2565753	It saves you time and effort, really, if just that.
2565933	2566593	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2585242	2585882	True, true.
2586102	2586923	So, that helps.
2587023	2587403	Works out.
2587603	2593125	Well, I mean, there's no reason for me to get this because I always bottle this shit the first day it came out.
2593205	2598166	But I'm glad to see that there's enough faith in the product that they're giving it a retail release.
2598206	2603288	I mean, who would have thought years ago when Rez was on Dreamcast it was kind of a cult title?
2603548	2604849	Like, not everybody really knew about it.
2604929	2608550	Who knew that it would be kind of resurfacing in the mainstream again today?
2608850	2609770	If that makes any sense.
2609850	2610151	I don't know.
2610591	2612351	I kind of wish they'd do a true sequel to Rez.
2612391	2613132	Wouldn't that be hot?
2613712	2613912	Well...
2614591	2615612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2643984	2647387	They are already, Gordon Chan is directing it.
2648287	2652711	There's not too many details, but they're sad.
2653632	2656475	And this is basically what was put out saying about it.
2657335	2662900	It looks like the King of Fighters movie will introduce a new science fiction spin into the setting.
2663561	2667024	That right there is enough to make me vomit.
2668649	2670691	Fighters in Space
2687766	2690969	It's like the crap they tried to do with the last Mortal Kombat movie.
2691609	2693731	No, don't ruin my movie, please.
2694091	2699756	Don't ruin... King of Fighters was like classic staple in fighting games for me.
2699937	2712328	I mean, I grew as a gamer when King of Fighters came out and expanded my mental universe and made me realize that, yes, SNK can do a good fighting game other than Samurai Shodown.
2715090	2722592	And what kind of cherished childhood memory would it be if they didn't come and rape it later on in a movie form?
2723133	2726173	Well, at least it's not being directed by Uwe Boll, so that's good.
2726914	2729895	Well, I'm glad I have something to be thankful for this holiday season.
2730215	2735556	But stars in the movie are Maggie Q, Sean Ferris, William Lee, and Ray Park.
2736276	2736477	Who?
2737217	2737957	Wait, Ray Park.
2738217	2739057	Darth Maul!
2739077	2739838	Darth Maul, yes.
2739938	2740758	And Seth Rogen.
2741358	2741698	And what?
2742198	2742418	And Toad.
2742438	2742778	Toad, eh.
2745728	2747489	Do you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad?
2749050	2750411	Same thing that happens to everything else.
2752112	2753873	It was awesome when Storm said it.
2755254	2755554	No, it wasn't.
2755574	2756174	Actually, it wasn't.
2756235	2757115	It really, really wasn't.
2757155	2764059	Okay, do not get this couch started on Halle Berry and how much ass she sucks.
2766001	2767401	Oh, but Jamie Catwoman.
2767481	2767802	No, wait.
2769056	2770777	I've blocked that out of my memory.
2770857	2772837	It does not exist as a part of my universe.
2772917	2774458	Hey, it could be worse, okay?
2774518	2777899	They could have had Tyra Banks play the part or something like that.
2778219	2781020	Tyra Banks has more personality, thank you.
2781100	2783381	She would have brought the much-needed sass to the part.
2783441	2785922	She would have brought the sass and she would have brought...
2787045	2787846	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2809335	2810075	What's the gut to?
2810115	2810935	What's the gut to?
2810995	2811696	What's the gut to?
2811716	2812496	What's the gut to?
2812516	2812916	What's the gut to?
2839346	2840147	Call of Duty Game
2861733	2869097	And then finally, they're going to do something a little different with the next Tony Hawk game, which apparently is going to not be played with a controller.
2870057	2877061	And will be a game that you're not going to be playing with a controller in your hands, according to them.
2877942	2885485	And of course, what everybody's been speculating, the rumors have been around for a long time now, that it's going to be actually some sort of motion-controlled skateboard thing.
2886046	2888167	Which, at that point, I have to ask...
2889440	2891501	Why don't you just go skateboard then?
2891561	2894841	If you're not actually going to be playing with a controller, just go skateboard.
2894881	2898022	I mean, you're almost there anyways, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper.
2898162	2899082	But air conditioning.
2900023	2900463	Carpet.
2903383	2903683	I know.
2904984	2905404	But still.
2906464	2907024	Skateboarding.
2907304	2914786	I mean, once you get to the point where it's so much like the thing that you're doing that you're actually doing it, you might as well just go actually do the sport.
2916551	2925479	and I'm sure I forgot to mention that they're probably going to be pumping out four more Guitar Hero games because they haven't buried that into the ground enough yet.
2926119	2927721	Oh, and Bizarre Creations.
2928321	2931344	You may remember them from the Project Gotham racing series.
2931984	2938570	They're actually working on another racing game as well that's going to be racing and driving focused.
2939231	2941252	You know, because that would be any other racing game.
2941893	2941973	Um,
2943658	2949199	And they're also working on one that's going to be similar to Mario Kart meets Forza.
2950420	2951140	What the hell?
2951180	2952680	Mario Kart meets Forza?
2953100	2959102	Maybe it's like a Mario Kart type of game, but you actually tune your cards and what weapons and stuff are on it and that kind of thing.
2959522	2961142	How about a cute Forza game?
2961342	2961942	That would be cute.
2962122	2968744	They already got Coral Q. You know, if you want your cute racer, buy the Coral Q franchise.
2969192	2986237	Did you see that they're actually putting out, and I don't know why they've done this over here, apparently EA doesn't know how to make games for the Wii, but they've decided that the next best idea to bringing NASCAR to the Wii instead of actually, I don't know, bringing NASCAR to the Wii is NASCAR Karts?
2987177	2987417	What?
2987817	2990338	Yeah, it's like Mario Kart with NASCAR drivers.
2992577	2993157	That's sad.
3009690	3018154	Well, while Loki was reading us that last little story there, I actually was working on my portal that lets us peer inside Dark Sakura's alternate universe.
3018254	3018554	What?
3018774	3024817	So I actually have a clip from Dark Sakura's alternate universe where Tyra Banks is Storm.
3025117	3029900	In fact, I'm going to show you how fantastic my underwear make me feel.
3046628	3051209	I really feel crazy standing up here in my underwear.
3051249	3056091	I'm used to doing this on, you know, a Victoria's Secret runway or in a catalog, but not on The Tyra Show.
3056631	3057932	So I need a little help.
3058212	3063454	Everybody, on the count of one, two, three, I want you to lose those under the canopy robes right now.
3063854	3065255	Free that underwear, everybody!
3077791	3079152	This is too much tire for this show.
3079472	3083094	We have the best parts coming up.
3084696	3085136	Lord.
3088158	3093901	Because today, today is a panty party!
3095482	3096543	It's a panty party.
3096863	3097664	Panty party.
3100345	3110650	Rob, if it was possible for this show to get any more uber gay, it just jumped the pink shark.
3110930	3114832	I would just like to point out that's one minute of your time you can never have back.
3118734	3120275	Courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.
3120315	3122676	And how is this part of the gamer lifestyle?
3122776	3123276	I don't know.
3123296	3129459	We're doing really good because we have not discussed food.
3132768	3134129	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3162233	3162954	Thank you for watching!
3191417	3192218	DJ Hero DJ Tiesto
3208433	3209234	Dance, trance, kind of scene.
3209274	3209834	So, very excited.
3209854	3210394	Dancey trancey.
3237157	3249067	Also should be noted, Paul Oakenfold apparently has seen the game, and that was kind of news that came out previously, but no word on whether he's on the soundtrack, but that would be quite a list of... I'd probably have to buy it then.
3249647	3251468	I'm already thinking Testo's pretty awesome.
3251849	3254591	And Tigerclaw is quick to point out, because I know he loves this kind of music.
3255171	3258754	This guy was number two on the DJ Mag Top 100 of 2008.
3258974	3265639	He got beat out by Armin van Buren, who, by the way, if I remember right, if memory serves me right, was in Beatmania 2DX7 style.
3267844	3269045	How's that for useless knowledge?
3270046	3271647	Okay, go sign you up for Jeopardy.
3271907	3272388	Apparently.
3273388	3274729	Dude, I love Jeopardy.
3274830	3276951	As long as you threaten Alex Trebek for us.
3276971	3281335	And then when I lose, I'll sing, I lost on Jeopardy, baby.
3283897	3287860	And you just respond to everything Alex Trebek says with, Well played, Trebek.
3291102	3292764	Like your mother, Trebek.
3294345	3295406	More news, then calls.
3295922	3299386	Okay, how about Lips?
3301067	3305872	Okay, the mic that's coming out with Lips works for Rock Band 2.
3306553	3306933	Or Will.
3308915	3312319	Okay, is Will... That's a sexy microphone, by the way.
3312359	3314020	That Lips microphone is very cute.
3314040	3314461	It glows.
3316061	3318102	I can't believe I left this out of my gaming week.
3318923	3319804	I know what you're talking about.
3319864	3320964	I bought SingStar ABBA!
3322765	3326908	I only got to play it for like five minutes because singing by yourself is no fun.
3327168	3332452	But SingStar ABBA... We need to do... After the show.
3333152	3333693	I'll show it.
3334613	3336014	After the show, I'll show you SingStar ABBA.
3336134	3336815	It's magnificent.
3336855	3337975	Becky sings fantastic.
3338196	3339957	Here, let me tell you this though, listeners.
3340357	3342558	You already know how you would feel about SingStar ABBA.
3342679	3343199	You already know.
3344158	3344558	Abba, Abba, Abba, Abba
3364715	3390605	I was actually at Best Buy a few times this weekend looking and just going through like their music section music game section and it's funny all the stuff that they have for Rock Band available they actually sell the ion drums there in store which is kind of crazy but you know what else I saw right underneath those ion drums that I was like for half a second going huh maybe I should the Rock Band stage kit
3392229	3394491	with the fog machine, and the lights.
3414093	3416954	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3443697	3445239	Fire drill, bye.
3445299	3446019	Question from the chatroom.
3446059	3447861	Acidic Vampire wants to know about Sing Star Abba.
3447921	3450183	Are there harmonized duets in Sing Star Abba?
3450724	3452666	Because I'd rather be Frida.
3452786	3453627	Good question.
3454908	3462155	I think three of the songs were duets, but again, I was playing it by myself because I was sad and lonely and playing Sing Star Abba by myself.
3462296	3463437	You know it would take a chance on you?
3463817	3464017	No.
3464418	3466239	But hey, I got like...
3466920	3467661	Thanks for watching!
3482911	3489660	Something that I've been saying, and I'm not really a big fan of it, but something that I'm saying that they should have done from the get-go with Rock Band.
3490902	3500054	Rock Band country music is going to be coming out, or at least some country download tracks will be coming out on December 16th.
3501375	3511180	and they're going to have, it doesn't really say yet what songs they're going to be, but the report, apparently they're claiming that there's going to be five songs as part of the pack.
3511240	3518504	Names include, let's look at it, Bentley, Brad Paisley, Brooks and Dunn, Miranda Lambert, and the Dixie Chicks as artists.
3519224	3524527	So, you know, I do think that they should have download content for country music in the game because...
3525367	3532811	There are people that like country music and they want to play that kind of stuff in Rock Band, and the download content's optional, so why not?
3533551	3535932	And I also think they should have more heavy metal in there.
3537853	3543276	Actually, you know, I do think that it's a good idea, though, to do the country content like that, because, I mean...
3544659	3549222	Currently, country music is not all the boring crap it was when I was a little kid.
3549903	3553525	And you've got some pretty difficult, I would say, difficult guitar out there.
3553765	3556147	And yes, I do agree, we need a lot more metal.
3556747	3560530	And I love the joystick posts that they were talking about, the different things.
3560550	3563371	We're going to take a moment to read the man, Jolene.
3564672	3565693	Yes, please.
3566033	3569415	And they're saying, who's going to mow your grass and the gambler?
3569596	3569836	I am 26.
3571334	3573095	Anything Kenny Rogers is fine with me.
3573875	3574816	The Gambler would be awesome.
3574836	3575856	What about Islands in the Stream?
3577357	3578037	I don't know about that.
3578477	3579978	Dude, give me anything, Dolly.
3580558	3581759	Dolly Parton is the woman, okay?
3581779	3585221	But you know, I bet this is them feeling the waters for a future...
3586738	3588059	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3607695	3614840	I would totally dig having some... I actually would pretty much dig the Brooks and Dunn content.
3615000	3616521	I would love some Alan Jackson.
3617382	3618963	That would be freaking rad.
3618983	3623426	But I would also, though, like to see them... This is my thought.
3623526	3631211	If the country content does well, then maybe they should expand and do some jazz content.
3632031	3635174	Do... Don't give me that look.
3635194	3635754	Okay.
3635914	3639097	No, I was just thinking Karaoke Revolution did a country version, right?
3639477	3643461	Remember when Karaoke Revolution got so popular that they did a country spin-off of that?
3643701	3652229	But I was thinking they should do other styles, because they're really sticking into that broad category of rock, as in the classic rock to hard rock.
3652389	3655852	Yeah, I could do less punk and rock music.
3656733	3658354	But there's plenty of it, that's the thing.
3658414	3660917	There's plenty of rock music, plenty of punk music,
3662738	3666359	They're really kind of starting to do that Scott stuff.
3666399	3667559	I don't know what you'd call it.
3667579	3670499	They did give us Rush, and that made me happy.
3670639	3672700	I am all over that No Doubt album next week.
3672760	3674440	I'm sorry, but I'm ready to party like it's 1995.
3674500	3679581	With that whole OJ verdict and everything this week, it's like 1995 all over again.
3679601	3680221	God, I know.
3680341	3680821	Isn't that awesome?
3680861	3681521	It's amazing.
3681621	3684482	I wanted to just get out my Beanie Babies and Pogs and just have a day.
3686022	3686342	Nerd.
3686862	3688742	Listen to Jagged Little Pill, watch some Apollo 13.
3688782	3689703	It's 1995 of them and her.
3694615	3695996	1995 was Radiohead for me, sorry.
3697336	3697916	That works too.
3698476	3708659	But seriously, we should do a list list one day of non-rock songs we want to hear in Rock Band.
3709019	3710519	Oh, I could get a little crazy with that.
3711019	3712079	That would be fantastic.
3712119	3712740	That would be fun.
3713420	3714580	One of the games have beat it.
3714780	3716120	I mean, that's awesome right there.
3716921	3719461	I hope it wasn't Rock Revolution because that would suck.
3719521	3720421	I think it was Guitar Hero.
3721062	3722442	Eh, I don't know.
3723779	3725801	And you rocked that Metallica edition.
3726521	3729003	Got one more song for you guys before we start to get into the last segment of the show.
3729023	3730504	No, they're going to have Guitar Hero Metallica, unfortunately.
3731564	3746534	This news is actually coming to us from LiveJournal, of which our eyes and ears are sometimes on LiveJournal, but apparently there's a whole Beatmania 2DX community out there on LiveJournal, and there was a post that highlights that some of the clips from Beatmania 2DX Empress, you know, which is the new one in arcades, it's what, 16th?
3747915	3748555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3772954	3775276	Oh, darn.
3775457	3779061	I don't know how he'll ever manage to get more clips up on the internet.
3779081	3781944	It's not like there's other services out there where they can do that.
3782645	3783505	Oh, wait, there are.
3786983	3789985	Why do you think though that Konami would suddenly put the squelch on this?
3790025	3793628	I mean, it's not like 2DX is a huge thing here in America anyway.
3793648	3795289	Because they have us stick up their ass, I don't know.
3795350	3796470	And then they won't care.
3797571	3799493	It's kind of dumb because it doesn't really hurt anything.
3799513	3806438	I don't see, you know, if anything, it's driving hype for it because everyone wants to see how hard these songs are and stuff like that.
3807779	3809940	I don't see what the big deal is, but hey, you know what?
3810660	3816743	They're in the right to be able to protect their property or whatever, but still, I think it's kind of stupid.
3816963	3827268	The only thing that can come good of this, of Konami taking this down, is that then I won't see them and get angry at them for not really trying to support Beatmania over here.
3828688	3832670	I mean, that's the only good thing that can come of it, because then I won't see them and get frustrated, even if
3833083	3837466	The quality of those games, in my opinion, has gone down ever since Red.
3838086	3842289	Once you get to the 16th version of something, it can't really be that edgy anymore.
3842589	3843010	It's tough.
3843210	3849014	I did have to go back to something from the previous story, by the way.
3849234	3853557	Suss says that they should have Rock Band Weird Al edition.
3854795	3855436	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3874459	3877082	It's sadly enough totally off topic with this.
3878204	3893861	For some reason in my carb, I was switching up the music that I've been listening to, and it got me thinking there is actually a way I was thinking that they could bring back DDR and make it actually new and fresh and have the same appeal as it did before, but I know that they would never do it.
3894361	3894782	What's that?
3896414	3902464	It would take too long to explain, but it's basically taking a different direction than they have it right now.
3902584	3909336	You know, kind of going back to the way it was and just, you know, making sure, like, keeping things...
3911235	3911595	All right.
3940836	3941236	Fair enough.
3941276	3943458	We can't dig enough into Loki's head.
3943558	3944399	There's a lot of stuff in there.
3944799	3945500	I've got a spoon.
3946460	3946981	We can try.
3947581	3950744	Well, anyhow, I don't know about you guys, but I get angsty when I think about all this news.
3950824	3953606	Just the fact that we don't really have Beatmania here in the U.S.
3953646	3954026	anymore.
3954386	3957128	The fact that the one way I got to watch it is taken down off YouTube.
3957849	3960391	I get a little bit angsty and thus queues the FUs of the week.
3977356	3985370	My biggest ever FU right now, because I have big ones all the time, goes to my finger.
3987279	3990221	And it also goes to not being able to find my splint earlier.
3990922	4000828	I've had a bad flare-up, and I've talked about it on the show before, but I had a flare-up of flexor tendonitis, which more commonly is known as trigger finger, in my right hand ring finger.
4001389	4005352	And I would like for people to look this up, because it's really kind of gross.
4007013	4012436	But it's basically, it started to hurt a lot, and I have art finals due.
4013537	4015298	So, it hurts to type.
4016319	4017400	It hurts to draw.
4017520	4018441	It hurts to write.
4019161	4021483	It hurts to do almost anything that requires holding something.
4021823	4022884	It hurts to hold a fork.
4023965	4026086	I can hold chopsticks pretty damn well, though, so that's good.
4026126	4028268	That means I can go have sushi all the time.
4028928	4030449	I should use that as my excuse, you know?
4031069	4032390	Um, I can't hold a fork.
4032430	4032931	I want sushi.
4034716	4035637	That would be awesome.
4035977	4036417	But, no.
4037578	4040419	So it's been kind of a major pain in the finger.
4040599	4042780	So, F you to my hand.
4042840	4049104	And also, I've got to go see the orthopedist.
4049884	4051205	I don't want surgery.
4052065	4056187	Because then that will put me behind on any of my physical drawing classes.
4056808	4057448	Surgery sucks.
4058569	4060410	Yeah, and you know all about that.
4061643	4063124	It wasn't the end of the world, though.
4063184	4064104	I have no gallbladder.
4064124	4065645	Laparoscopic surgery is not so bad.
4065705	4067546	Hey, look, you know, I've been starting to eat some of this.
4067766	4069586	I had Jack in the Box the other day, okay?
4069646	4072808	It was not getting that for like six months and getting to eat it.
4073068	4073308	Great.
4073448	4078290	And the other thing also having to do with medical woes is the fact that every time I eat anything, it makes me sick.
4080451	4082712	Speaking of which, small accomplishments in gallbladder world.
4083452	4084732	I had Mexican food yesterday.
4085093	4085713	I haven't had Mexican food.
4085733	4087273	And I'm not talking about like fucking Taco Bell.
4087293	4091015	I'm talking about like Aldo Berritos where you get like pretty decent Mexican food.
4091690	4092731	I actually ate that yesterday.
4092811	4094111	Made with real lard?
4094312	4095032	Yes, I'm okay.
4095532	4096073	Hey!
4096633	4096913	I'm good.
4097434	4102397	No, it's been like randomly every time I eat something I get kind of lonely.
4102757	4103877	It's like when I had the plague.
4104938	4106219	See, we talked food after all.
4107580	4107880	Awesome.
4107940	4110501	But I had Indian food today and I didn't care how sick I got.
4111342	4112343	It was awesome.
4112443	4114404	That's one thing we've got to do soon.
4114444	4116685	We are so going back to Star of India.
4116805	4118226	Anyway, Loki, do you have any FUs?
4119627	4119747	Um,
4120396	4128203	SmallFU2 fries because they sold me a defective set of RAM.
4128363	4143276	I was going to upgrade my computer from 2 to 4 gigs and the second pair of RAM chips I got apparently no worky because my computer crashes after like 2 minutes every time I launch it up now.
4143860	4145461	So I had to take those out, so that sucked.
4146441	4149623	And then FU to Kaiser for reasons I can't say.
4150323	4160467	And FU to my work for giving me way more accounts than I can handle and not giving me any more money.
4160487	4161848	At least I don't think they are.
4162368	4164929	And that sucks because there's nothing I can do about it.
4165309	4168751	I haven't FU'd your work for similar reasons.
4169540	4170581	and DarkSakura.
4197352	4197752	That's it.
4200053	4202855	I told you I would be all over that if it paid more.
4203155	4205016	Well, yeah, I'd be all over it too if it paid more.
4206257	4207137	I'll keep mine short.
4207177	4207637	My F.U.
4207677	4210239	is to the cold weather because it's cool.
4210999	4214081	Beckers, you've been quiet tonight, but maybe you have a little angst in you.
4214121	4215701	Do you have anything you want to give a good F.U.
4215741	4216682	to, a good hearty F.U.
4216702	4216802	to?
4220638	4221218	DarkSakura.com
4238038	4238338	All right.
4239599	4245401	Hey, we got one more segment before we open up the Skype lines for you guys at our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4245441	4247762	And it's a favorite here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4248202	4250883	One that I stole last week when DarkSakura wasn't here.
4251283	4251503	What?
4251523	4251963	I stole it.
4252003	4252884	The classic game of the week.
4253204	4254184	You are a whore.
4254724	4256105	No, it was a good game, though.
4256145	4258926	I got to give the Commodore 64 a little love last week, so it was good.
4259266	4261827	But now we get to go back to DarkSakura.
4261927	4262107	What?
4262807	4263107	Heart.
4263448	4263868	Thank you.
4265548	4266929	What's tonight's classic game of the week?
4267885	4268606	Super Metroid!
4269907	4271689	A very good choice it is tonight.
4272670	4274451	This is a good way for you to return to the program.
4274471	4276633	I had to put the intro music up there first.
4277754	4279195	And then my favorite music in the game.
4279616	4282558	That's my favorite music in the damn game.
4283760	4285081	Do you want to turn it up a little bit?
4289177	4290598	It's the Brinstar music.
4290998	4297004	Anyway, Super Metroid is basically a... I mean, it plays... We know what the fuck Metroid is.
4297144	4301849	You run and you shoot shit and you're a girl in armor and you get weapons on the way.
4304727	4311330	Basically, Samus returns back to the Metroid-y planet.
4312090	4312870	Zebes, sorry.
4313570	4322234	And basically gets to explore around and kill things and find all of her old enemies and get some very new weapons.
4322874	4327919	So, um, you get the moonwalk, which means you can slide backwards while firing.
4328340	4330602	You have, um, the ability to combine beams.
4331583	4336668	And, um, it has the save system that they put in Metroid 2, so that's pretty cool.
4337609	4338150	And, um...
4339642	4345984	You also can go back into the gunship and save and recharge and do fun stuff there.
4346704	4350906	And all kinds of little secret areas you can get to by combining your weapons in different ways.
4350966	4352326	It's really, really fun.
4354267	4362770	But basically, you have to go back and find her baby Metroid.
4364301	4364621	Really?
4365081	4365381	Okay.
4365702	4372944	In Metroid 2, she took home, there was a Metroid that hatched and believed Samus was its mommy.
4373985	4378747	And so she took it off to be studied to see if they can help people.
4379407	4384269	And then someone stole the Metroid and she had to go back after her baby.
4385949	4387270	Samus' jellyfish looking baby.
4387310	4388911	The last Metroid is in captivity.
4390071	4392232	The galaxy is at peace.
4395302	4398166	Digitized voice for Super Nintendo, hi!
4401732	4402052	Anyway.
4402974	4403054	Um.
4406449	4415778	I did think it was funny that the Metroid producer was busy working on the Virtual Boy at the time and didn't have much involvement with this.
4416398	4425226	But this is a game that I'll get Dan to play, and I'll just sit back on the couch going, go this way, go that way, go this way, go that way.
4425967	4426947	That's really freaking cool.
4427468	4428469	You're better at this than I am.
4428840	4430121	You know my thoughts on this game.
4430681	4435224	I love this game more than most other games.
4435804	4436685	Pretty much any other game.
4437105	4438085	I love this game so much.
4438326	4443308	I've already been caught up in the controversy about how much I love this game.
4443348	4445310	I won't repeat it, but let's just say I love this game.
4446090	4448332	This game is electronic nookie.
4449433	4451235	So, um, what?
4451696	4451996	It is!
4452076	4453998	It is Sex and Pixels.
4454058	4454599	It really is.
4454679	4455880	Without being dirty.
4455980	4457181	Yeah.
4457401	4469774	Of course, we all know that this game has been the big influence for the current series of Castlevania games, you know, with that same type of map system running all over the place shooting stuff, except using a whip.
4470474	4492558	um it also is one of it's actually stated um in my resource that it was a contributor to the speedrun phenomenon because you did actually if for beating the the game in different ways you got different rewards different things you can speedrun through super metroid like a mofo if you know where you're going and what you're doing
4493178	4497641	I've seen this game beaten in person on a major speedrun.
4498161	4499522	And it was beautiful.
4500382	4504104	So, it's really awesometastic.
4505966	4506726	Super Metroid!
4506786	4508107	Super Metroid Game of the Week.
4508127	4511949	You have to get it to the point where it plays the theme.
4512709	4514530	I think it's just going to start the first level.
4514571	4514931	Here we go.
4514991	4515291	All right.
4526773	4527474	I love this game.
4528614	4529314	I do love this game.
4529414	4531035	I want to play this game right now.
4531055	4531755	Fuck this show.
4531775	4535396	The music in this game was freaking fantastic.
4535796	4536417	It really was.
4537117	4546680	You know what the Nintendo sound processor was eventually what was incorporated, if I'm right, it's what led to the one in the PlayStation.
4546700	4549481	Because Sony made Nintendo's sound processor.
4550261	4557584	I really just want to say, because we do have some younger folks that listen to this show who weren't a teenager or junior high or whatever when this game first came out.
4557644	4559405	You really owe it to yourself to check out this game.
4559545	4562546	This is gaming at some of its greatest.
4563826	4568688	And as much crap as I've given the whole Chrono Trigger versus Super Metroid thing that came up totally unnecessarily.
4569008	4569768	Thanks for watching!
4595970	4599492	I mean, seriously, no one's going to care if it's a 2D game.
4599913	4605796	No one's not going to buy your game just because, oh, it's 2D, I don't want to play a 2D game.
4606357	4609559	Well, you know what, people will play a 2D game and they will like it.
4610279	4613141	Look at a game like Braid, you can still do awesome things in 2D.
4613161	4622026	Look at Castlevania games, they sell like hotcakes on the DS, and they would sell like hotcakes on the Wii if they put out a really cool looking 2D Castlevania game.
4622667	4623587	You don't have to go all 3D.
4624688	4625728	Just make it fun.
4625808	4627369	Make it exciting.
4627629	4628889	That's all you have to do.
4629669	4630029	Alright.
4630429	4631690	Well, we are going to go... Hey, you know what?
4631710	4635051	That Metroid Zero game, even though it was on the Game Boy Advance, was pretty awesome.
4635271	4639512	That was a great successor, in a way, to Super Metroid, if that makes sense.
4639572	4644833	And they revisited the original Metroid, but changed just enough that it really felt all new again, which I thought was kind of awesome.
4645433	4647094	So, there you go.
4647114	4649234	It's open.
4649254	4651715	I'm just now seeing, though, that our time might have run out on it.
4652904	4653224	Whoops!
4653564	4653985	We'll see.
4655926	4659648	I'm curious if the Skype line is going to work tonight or if I'm late.
4660828	4662089	Today was the day it runs out.
4662930	4665591	So we may or may not be able to get calls tonight.
4665611	4670814	1-877-GAME-OLR I'm going to try calling it myself real fast and see if it works.
4670834	4676657	1-877-GAME-OLR Oh, we have a call.
4676997	4678578	Oh, that call is coming in on Skype though.
4678598	4680219	1-877-GAME-OLR
4681048	4683393	O-L-R Let me see if it works.
4683613	4684435	I'm calling it myself.
4686739	4690085	Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I do this live on air test that's very professional?
4690466	4690747	Yes.
4691645	4695506	Real quick stuff, just confirming a lot of the rumors that we had from a couple weeks ago.
4695946	4699027	Uncharted 2 Among Thieves was announced.
4699467	4703829	Remember that thing that supposedly leaked out from Sony saying that there was a new Uncharted game?
4704129	4708730	Well, apparently it's true, so I wonder if the rest of it will be true as well.
4709210	4717333	Another big game that we should have mentioned during this show, but Killzone 2 finally got a release date, February 27th.
4719072	4730941	If there's ever going to be an epic first-person shooter game for the PS3, it definitely kills into their Gears of War, if you want to look at it that way.
4732342	4737065	Kind of interesting, someone's bringing Catan to the PS3 as well.
4737785	4739226	Game Republic is bringing out that game.
4739286	4741528	It's actually going to be a different version that was on the 360.
4741688	4743329	I kind of like this one better.
4745251	4746491	No word on when that's going to be out, though.
4747572	4748373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4770413	4773494	and it will create objects for you based on what you write in.
4773854	4780237	So for example, you have to collect these stars throughout the game and you can write in ladder and a ladder will spawn.
4780257	4787620	You can climb the ladder to get the star or you write in football and you can throw a football at the tree or beaver and the beaver will chew down the tree.
4787640	4795163	Well apparently there's such an enormous dictionary of words in this game you can literally put whatever you want.
4795303	4795903	I mean just...
4797315	4797855	Thank you for watching!
4812535	4823081	And then finally, I'd like to mention that apparently, according to YYR in chat, he is having a contest.
4823541	4824802	Oh, I was going to read this.
4824962	4825523	Well, fine.
4825543	4826463	You go ahead and read this.
4826483	4826923	No, go ahead.
4826983	4827484	No, no, no.
4827544	4828144	You stole my thought.
4828184	4828424	No, no, no.
4828444	4828644	Go ahead.
4828944	4829665	Okay, I will say this.
4830305	4832126	The contest actually doesn't start until Tuesday.
4832146	4833587	We're giving you a sneak peek right here.
4833607	4833987	Snake360 contest.
4835831	4850642	Yes, and you can win, there's $450 in prizes to be given away, and they have three different challenges, Race to Fanatic, Survivor Challenge, and Battle Video Exhibition, and of course, different prizes.
4851122	4859488	Looks like the prizes for each category include either a 4,000 points card or one year of live.
4861209	4863451	Lots of stuff being given away, so that's kind of cool.
4864291	4870513	And apparently the contest starts on Tuesday, ends on Sunday, January 11th.
4871193	4874495	And we can really say, and truthfully say, you heard it here first.
4874615	4879256	Because Aaron, the author of the game, just put this up and sent us a message first.
4879276	4881917	Because we had him on our show a couple weeks ago and he hasn't forgotten about us.
4882797	4883418	Awesome guy.
4884118	4884598	Thank you very much.
4884678	4890260	And I don't know if we're automatically ineligible, but I'm thinking the battle video might actually be kind of fun to try.
4892076	4892336	Well, um, no.
4919212	4919932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4936317	4937038	That sounds pretty fun.
4937058	4938559	Which is pretty cool.
4938599	4941981	And then, of course, Gran Turismo 5 apparently is on track for holiday of the night.
4942261	4947585	Funny, because I thought that was supposed to be out this year, but, you know, hey, I guess it's still on track to come out someday.
4947605	4948085	Show us home.
4948145	4948825	Hey, we got a call.
4948885	4949766	Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4949786	4950086	Who's this?
4950747	4952428	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.
4952468	4954029	Apparently, I'm very special tonight, and...
4955530	4958252	The One Voice of the Crowd, or something like that.
4976229	4976869	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5002119	5002899	Thanks for watching!
5025093	5040256	Um, when DJ Hero and all that stuff was kind of coming up, I was just kind of going around looking for information, and I pulled up a Kotaku post about it with the first notes on it, and the picture of it reminded me of a story that I don't believe I've told on here.
5041536	5053839	Before I get into that, I was just going to kind of ask, there's been a screenshot that makes DJ Hero look like Guitar Hero with a DJ floating next to the chart, but we don't really know anything about the game itself or the controller, do we?
5055676	5057398	There were some rumors about the controller a while back.
5057438	5061161	Wasn't the controller supposed to be like a giant turntable with kind of like buttons around it or something like that?
5061241	5066345	I seem to remember there was a story a couple... Yeah, something like, it's not going to look like Beatmania.
5066525	5067146	That's for sure.
5067826	5071629	That's a common misconception about it is that, oh, well, they're going to rip off Beatmania.
5071689	5075012	Nah, it doesn't look like they really want to go for that exact same game.
5075332	5076513	It's going to be different, it looks like.
5077034	5084139	Guitars and drums can't exactly be made original when they're supposed to be guitars and drums, but DJ decks have a lot of liberty to play with.
5084660	5084820	True.
5085300	5096049	So the Kotaku entry that I was talking about, you know that Joystick and Kotaku and everybody else picks a featured picture that my Mario Kart code has been so greatly featured on three years ago.
5098751	5103875	They have this little actual DJ Pioneer deck that reminded me of something I saw at Best Buy.
5104816	5107918	Our Best Buy opened up a musical instruments corner of the building.
5108644	5112845	and when we were there the last time, we kind of poked our heads in there and were killing some time.
5113245	5116386	They had a bunch of drum kits, digital drum kits laid out.
5116746	5133211	They had drawers of DJ kits with full-size digital turntable decks, I guess, and little miniature turntable decks with the crossfader and the, if there's a specific name for the centerpiece, far be it for me to know what it's called.
5133643	5134163	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5153689	5176697	I'm kind of looking forward to seeing more with what comes about with DJ Hero I think we are all on pins and needles about DJ Hero, Jason But the sad thing is I don't think we're going to see it until E3 I think this is going to be Activision's big thing at E3 next year Because with Guitar Hero, we know that shit They say new Guitar Hero game, we're like whoopty shit, we know what this is all about But DJ Hero is going to be real new, you know what I mean?
5176717	5177457	Yeah
5178491	5181553	and you can draw the parallels to everything you want that's already come out.
5181893	5186597	Beatmania and Kraken DJ and I seem to remember there was something even more obscure that I can't think of.
5186977	5193262	Kraken DJ was fun and all, but it just wasn't a real deck besides... Okay, it was.
5193322	5194764	Two turntables and a crossfader.
5195444	5199007	But none of the effectors, none of the volumes, none of that.
5199307	5204812	Also, remember this, Jason, like 98% of gamers haven't played any of those games you just mentioned, too.
5204912	5207534	But DJ Hero really has the potential, you know, to kind of
5208482	5210185	The foot is already in the door, so to speak.
5210345	5212027	It's going to get shelf space right next to Guitar Hero.
5215459	5216259	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5240209	5245451	And, you know, sometimes women will come in here and want to know, where's that guitar game for my husband who's been away?
5245471	5246832	And I'm thinking, like, wow.
5246932	5256395	I mean, like, that really just kind of put into perspective, like, it really has kind of crossed over now into, like, that guitar game that every family has to have, if that makes sense.
5256915	5261117	That's because they picked music that people actually know and care about to some extent.
5261177	5267900	But DJ Hero is going to have a huge foot in the door because of the mainstream success of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, really.
5268520	5268640	Yeah.
5269745	5274668	and the fact that they're actually going for names like Tiesto and anybody else that they're going to sign and announce later on down the line.
5274828	5278631	Who would have thunk it when we started this show a few years ago that music games would become so huge, huh?
5279231	5282653	Especially after we moved away from just music games.
5282873	5283734	Well, that's what did it.
5286055	5293180	Remember there was no new DDR for like years and years and literally two weeks after we said, we're going to move away from the music game things and talk about general gaming.
5293460	5295341	Supernova is coming out.
5295381	5296002	We're back.
5297323	5297783	Bastards.
5298359	5298619	All right.
5299179	5299479	Anyway.
5299699	5301380	Konami exists to spite you.
5301420	5303721	Konami does exist to spite us sometimes.
5303781	5305001	I really truly believe that.
5305682	5314205	I think the most interesting part about all this is the Guitar Hero arcade cabinets that was talked about a few weeks back.
5314385	5314625	Yeah.
5315265	5323668	And just the fact that they can do, especially with the fact that Guitar Hero itself went world tour, and the fact that apparently Konami's working with Activision for the cabinets.
5323688	5323828	Yeah.
5324486	5328407	If that didn't just signal Rock Revolution's death that we already knew was coming, what does?
5329147	5334908	But just the fact that World Tour exists and DJ Hero was acquired by Activision.
5335828	5342110	Should I say Freestyle Games was acquired by Activision, who was making DJ Hero.
5342810	5353572	The big linked performance games that we always wanted out of DDR, 2DX, Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and optionally Keyboard Mania, but that died pretty quick.
5354684	5360931	can actually come stateside, stateside music, and possibly too a lot for arcades for all we know.
5361431	5362793	It'll be freaking expensive, though.
5362973	5366797	You know, I said this a long time ago on the show, and I truly believe it.
5366957	5371982	Harmonix and these developers were willing to take the risk that Konami wasn't, and look where it got them.
5372458	5374579	and Konami should be kicking their own ass right now.
5374599	5386363	And if they didn't have the, if there weren't patent laws and all that stuff so that they could essentially ride the coattails now of someone else's success from their idea, which is odd, there wouldn't be a lot going for them right now in the music game world.
5386903	5393126	As much as we can hate on them for filing those lawsuits, the fact that they're working together for an arcade machine is kind of redeeming.
5394186	5397608	I want to quickly say this comment, Jason, before we let you go, get your reaction to this.
5397668	5398768	TigerClaw in chat says,
5399367	5404048	If you want to play your own version of DJ Hero, you can download a DJ mixing program on your PC and mix your own MP3s.
5404949	5408150	But that's boring because that's not telling me how to do it.
5408370	5408730	Exactly.
5408770	5409710	I can't play without arrows on the screen.
5409730	5412671	There's no arrows to step on or whatever.
5413411	5413691	All right.
5414071	5415792	Jason, we've got to let you go to get a couple more calls.
5415872	5416672	But you have a good one, buddy.
5416792	5417592	It's always good to hear from you.
5417612	5419013	Giant Dorkfest.
5419193	5419453	All right.
5419573	5420493	Yeah, that's this show.
5420773	5421373	All right.
5421534	5421974	Later, dude.
5422454	5422834	Night, guys.
5424375	5426058	Orange Lounge Radio is our name on Skype.
5426078	5430106	The 800 number is broke tonight because I don't know how to pay a bill on time, apparently.
5431889	5432871	For shame.
5433232	5435075	I forgot it was expiring today.
5435155	5436197	They sent their reminders.
5436258	5436899	I got busy.
5439471	5441172	I don't really see any other calls coming through.
5442293	5443654	Do we clear out our last minute stories?
5443674	5444214	Ring, ring.
5444234	5444614	We're done?
5444634	5444974	Ring, ring.
5444994	5445775	Yeah, pretty much.
5446275	5447096	Hi, Rob.
5447156	5448076	Oh, you wanted to read mail.
5448236	5448997	We never did mailbag.
5449017	5450258	This is Jimmy.
5450278	5451598	I have to do the mailbag.
5451618	5453620	I was going to say, first you told me there was no mailbag.
5453680	5454820	Now you're telling me there's a mailbag.
5455041	5455821	I didn't think we'd have time.
5456041	5456281	All right.
5456441	5457462	Well, we'll do it.
5457502	5459964	Since no one else is calling on Skype, we'll close Skype.
5460144	5460784	It's for you guys.
5460804	5461805	You know what?
5462105	5468529	We need to actually have theme music for the Skype thing, and we need to play Bananaphone.
5469648	5470208	You know what's funny?
5470228	5471749	That was the fortune cookie message last week.
5471949	5472869	When you weren't here, yes.
5473590	5475170	How funny.
5475390	5475691	All right.
5475911	5478592	Yeah, I thought Ranma was calling in to give a review on something.
5478632	5479092	Where is he?
5479712	5481073	Oh, because he's on the phone.
5482273	5482613	Oops.
5482834	5483594	Sorry, Ranma.
5484094	5484654	Love you.
5486935	5487816	But we love the mailbag, too.
5487836	5492918	Mailbag, orangelaunchradio.com, which apparently we are doing this segment tonight, although I only saw one email in there when I went in earlier.
5494358	5495159	So I'll send an email.
5496314	5498015	Hello, OLR buddies and friends.
5498096	5500017	It's actually titled Why Hello There, OLR.
5501218	5504401	I finally joined the new millennium and got an Xbox 360.
5504601	5512808	I've survived solely on DS and PSP for the longest time, and I have to say that it's nice to have a non-portable gaming system again for the first time in nearly three years.
5513308	5516411	So far, I only have Guitar Hero 3 and Guitar Hero Aerosmith.
5516611	5519933	My band's names are Spock's Eyebrows and Doodly Ladies, respectively.
5520894	5522715	but I hope to remedy this soon.
5522855	5525956	What are some good Xbox 360 games that I should look into purchasing?
5526557	5527097	Fable!
5529318	5532599	Fable 2 is kind of evil but it is definitely entertaining.
5532679	5533620	You can beat up chickens.
5534440	5538222	Please go on Xbox Live Arcade and look at all the sex that's on there.
5538522	5539943	Symphony of the Night!
5540523	5544345	If you don't already have that on PlayStation 1, definitely Symphony of the Night.
5544785	5547786	Go look at how much sex is available for cheap on Xbox Live Arcade.
5547806	5548486	That's where you need to go.
5551548	5561217	and, um, oh shoot, there's also, um, there's of course the Rock Band series and, um, um, Brain Fart.
5562358	5563299	Brain Fart the game!
5563960	5564540	Guitar Hero?
5565261	5566602	She already said she had them!
5567768	5568048	Oh yeah.
5568389	5568649	Okay.
5569570	5571392	So, moving forward.
5572313	5576958	Since Jamie mentioned playing Order of Ecclesia, I figured I would quickly plug the review I did of that game.
5577058	5577959	It's great!
5578800	5582243	And can be found on my blog at www.AvengersTower.com
5583024	5585547	The game is great, or the review is great?
5585567	5585827	Both.
5586708	5594276	Order of Ecclesia is definitely a very difficult game compared to earlier Castlevania games, but the difficulty of the game most certainly adds to the fun.
5594756	5598640	Anyway, OLR, take care of yourselves, and I'll quite possibly see you soon.
5599181	5600622	As soon as next year, perhaps.
5600903	5601563	Eyebrow waggle.
5602244	5603085	Sincerely, Marin.
5603365	5605246	Take care of yourself and each other.
5605526	5609847	Real quick, and this kind of goes back to something we were talking about way earlier in the show.
5610467	5615789	Kunimatata, that was on your release dates for coming out in the Asia regions.
5615849	5621191	Well, it's already been out in the Asia regions, but this is the English slash Chinese version.
5621331	5624552	So you could import this and play it in English.
5625593	5626273	Thought about it.
5626673	5626973	It's only $49.90.
5627813	5629854	It's not bad.
5630874	5632055	Can't run over the animals, though.
5632075	5632935	That is a downside.
5633240	5636841	Dope.
5636882	5637802	We have more.
5638062	5639343	Alright, let's hear more.
5639823	5640803	One of them tricked me!
5641383	5644485	It said love, love, love, love, love, and I thought it was about me, but it was spam.
5645825	5646325	Bastards.
5646365	5647246	I hate those spammers.
5647986	5649207	You know who you should have F'ed?
5649427	5651247	The one who stole your magnet off your car.
5651908	5653148	Oh, I forgot about that.
5654929	5659811	I had a rainbow all love is divine magnet on my car, and somebody stole it.
5662007	5663288	Oh, it's on the fridge right now.
5664869	5665549	Pissed me off.
5665689	5666330	That's so messed up.
5668311	5668992	Damn thieves!
5669713	5670333	Bastards!
5670753	5671814	I can't make a fist.
5671874	5672575	This sucks.
5673696	5678019	Okay, this is your Friendly Neighborhood Mexican Actdeft.
5679620	5682923	A few weeks ago I got Tales of Vesperia and it's a pretty good game.
5683123	5683763	I recommend it.
5683823	5684904	Can I point out where we live?
5684944	5686786	There's lots of Friendly Neighborhood Mexicans.
5687026	5687927	Actually, lots and lots.
5688700	5689261	Just wanted to say.
5689381	5692484	But he's an actual in-Mexico Mexican.
5692665	5693205	Alright, fair enough.
5693906	5695127	And that makes him special.
5697739	5698279	Thanks for watching!
5724417	5752955	with the most recent global economy crisis the Mexican peso has lost its gain to the US dollar but for gaming it has meant a good thing rather than bad when I bought Tales of Vesperia I bought it for 755 pesos which is the MSRP price for it down here now a dollar is worth 1350 pesos approximately so doing the math I solved the game and cost the equivalent of $55 US total that's a savings of $5 US without added sales tax
5753895	5757656	I marveled myself on how this crisis has caused at least one good thing.
5757776	5760497	Another example is Gears of War 2, which is a newer game.
5760877	5765258	In the US, it costs $60, while in Mexico it costs around $6.50.
5766058	5769799	Again, doing the math, the game's cost in Mexico is the equivalent of $47, approximately $13 in savings.
5773360	5776222	and there are other games that would cost less here than crossing the border.
5776622	5793934	Unfortunately, there are other games that still do cost more here than in the U.S., but like I said, it's because of store making up prices rather than giving us the real retail price, especially on PlayStation and Nintendo games since they don't have a real representation in Mexico or Latin America, unlike Microsoft, which does have it.
5794494	5797696	Oh well, that's all for now.
5798237	5799818	Oh well, that's all for now, OLR Crew.
5800198	5802620	Kind of happy news in all this crisis stuff.
5802720	5802940	See ya.
5803801	5807108	Sorry to Jamie who reads this email if there are any grammatical or spelling errors in it.
5807830	5808311	You know what?
5810014	5810996	You have better...
5812970	5816772	Grammar and spelling than most people in America do.
5817193	5821055	When you consider the English is not this gentleman's first language, from what I understand.
5821135	5823437	I believe he said before Spanish is the native language.
5823477	5825038	You're my freaking hero today.
5825118	5826238	There you go.
5826258	5829100	A very rare commendation from DarkSakura.
5829120	5831382	You don't get that very often in the mailbag, Saban.
5831402	5831922	Look at you.
5832262	5833663	Wear that badge with honor, my friend.
5834484	5839367	We also got an email forwarded to us.
5840205	5841646	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5869049	5876051	What might be your thoughts regarding you as the consumer using LittleBigPlanet as an advertising and self-promoting marketing tool?
5876091	5879952	Okay, let me give you the gist of the email because it is kind of long for air, but I did read it off air.
5879992	5889855	Basically, the emailer was wondering, he was listening to some other shows on All Games and this kind of crossed his mind and wanted to hear our take on it because I guess he's been pulling some different shows.
5889875	5890575	Huh?
5891015	5892256	I'm glad I didn't put it on the forum then.
5892456	5896099	No, no, it's a good question.
5896560	5901784	LittleBigPlanet has this potential to be a new medium for all this marketing.
5903546	5905708	What's the potential for it, or where do you see people using it?
5906628	5909991	What do you think people could be using LittleBigPlanet for with all the marketing?
5911072	5912794	And to me, I kind of think, in a way, it's a new...
5915013	5917435	LittleBigPlanet, I kind of compare to a new website.
5917975	5918536	Does that make sense?
5918856	5921918	Like a YouTube or iTunes or something.
5921938	5924259	I guess iTunes isn't really a website, but you know what I mean?
5924820	5929863	If there's a way to sell your product on it, there will be people that want to do that.
5929963	5932285	I mean, it is the quote-unquote American way after all.
5932805	5933305	I-Tunes Podcasting
5953072	5961355	When we signed up to do podcasting, it was people like us in their garages, in their basements with microphones talking about shit they liked.
5962756	5979042	Now it's hugely commercialized, and we're having a hard time staying afloat amongst all these... I mean, we'll be here doing our thing for a long, long time, but we have a hard time getting recognized because you have all these commercial people out trying to tie it into their website, their TV shows, their...
5979803	5984772	TV networks that have very little to do with gaming but they have video game podcasts anyways and so on.

6030777	6031377	True story.
6031697	6036079	I was playing Warcraft the other night, and there was a shout in one of the villages.
6036119	6036819	I'm not even kidding.
6038079	6040880	If you live in, like, I think it was Boston.
6040980	6046202	If you live in Boston, come check out this show on Saturday night if you like this metal band.
6046382	6052524	And I'm like, dude, how many people in this world of Warcraft might live in Boston?
6052564	6055024	Boston's a pretty big place.
6055144	6058865	I know it's a big place, but World of Warcraft is a really fucking big place.
6058966	6059466	It's like 100 Bostons.
6060666	6061727	Thank you very much, Nintendo.
6084617	6085559	Very true, very true.
6085579	6087381	I didn't even think about that, but you're right.
6087922	6090586	People have been using video games to promote their shit for a long time.
6090866	6099158	But we could actually have all of our villagers say OrangeSoundsRadio.com and then when they move to other people's villages, they'll spread.
6100203	6100603	LittleBigPlanet
6130363	6133806	You know, and granted, I don't think he put a lot of effort into the level.
6133826	6138069	I think he was more, it was his way of exploring the game and being able to give the game a good review.
6138129	6141952	I don't think he ever kind of intended it to be like, you know, the one and only thing he ever does.
6142032	6151339	But, you know, he invested a fair amount of time into it, but he kind of did like a real easy-ish type of level that kind of slyly worked in a plug for his show.
6152520	6155302	I think as long as you're not crazy about it, I bet they wouldn't.
6155322	6159385	They were actually promoting a LittleBigPlanet fan community on there, and it got pulled.
6160445	6161846	Wow, that's so weird.
6162006	6163027	Yeah, it is stupid.
6163407	6165069	They're getting a little stupid with that stuff.
6166850	6167931	What are you laughing at over there?
6168391	6172534	A picture that I got sent for the cover of Wolverine in Power Pack.
6173495	6178519	To go back to the email, definitely where there's a way to do it, people are going to do it.
6179579	6179699	It's...
6182569	6189531	It's just a matter of time, but it's kind of interesting to see the moderation and how that's going to play into it because it was very hard to moderate Animal Crossing.
6189671	6193012	I mean, look at the N-word snuck through on one of those cartridges.
6194692	6199134	Anyhow, I guess that's it for our show then.
6199214	6200074	Was that the last email too?
6200894	6202255	It was indeed, Rob.
6202275	6202575	All right.
6203235	6206956	Last email tonight, and if you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
6207611	6208071	We're done.
6208151	6209191	We're ready to get out of here.
6209251	6211472	We got the final thoughts tonight.
6211952	6212272	Oh.
6212813	6213013	Yeah.
6213193	6214513	Never mind, because it comes after.
6214533	6215913	Okay.
6216013	6217174	Loki, your final thought tonight.
6217954	6226737	I'm looking at this actual P90 tactical load-bearing vest, which is kind of neat, because that would work with my airsoft gun, even though it's meant for actual real guns.
6227717	6228017	All right.
6228437	6229777	DarkSakra, your final thought.
6230118	6231338	Deadpool's fucking funny.
6233011	6234913	My final thought is I'm fucking funny.
6236134	6237235	Beckers, shut up.
6237555	6239036	Beckers, thanks for joining us tonight.
6239076	6243200	I know you didn't get to talk a whole lot, but I'm glad you and Jamie got to sit there in the corner and giggle like girls.
6243260	6243660	It was fun.
6244081	6247083	Do you have any final words for our listeners tonight?
6247524	6248845	It's freaking cold here.
6248965	6249585	It is cold here.
6249625	6250086	I'm sorry.
6251627	6253208	You should see what it's like in the summertime, though.
6253248	6254650	Trust me, this is better than The Alternative.
6254750	6260935	We need to have Becky on when we have stupid parent stories.
6262189	6262670	Oh boy.
6262870	6265551	Because we definitely need to hear from someone.
6265572	6267153	Oh, thank you for reminding me.
6267173	6269354	We didn't even mention that story.
6269554	6270115	Uh oh, what?
6271275	6272236	Uh, hold on, hold on.
6272776	6273737	This is good, this is good.
6275198	6284084	Um, it was another game that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed, or another crime that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed for, and it had nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto at all.
6285085	6288227	Um, it had to do with, uh,
6289144	6291926	Children torturing animals.
6293687	6294928	Yes, that's right.
6295168	6307756	Apparently, the newest crime to get blamed, or Grand Theft Auto can get blamed for, is hanging kittens with game controller cords after playing Grand Theft Auto.
6308416	6309056	Apparently...
6311607	6319849	A pair of unsupervised boys, six and seven years old, stoned a kitten and then strung it up following a Grand Theft Auto session.
6320269	6323010	They reportedly used the controller cable in lieu of a rope.
6323050	6325951	And you're not talking about blowing the bong smoke in the kitty's face.
6326151	6326711	No, no.
6327091	6328051	Oh, God, that's terrible.
6328991	6332232	Apparently this happened in late October in Mesa, Arizona.
6333172	6339314	And it says the investigation began when deputies went to the neighborhood of one of the two boys.
6339714	6341896	You know, I'm thinking this goes a little bit beyond video games.
6341916	6344218	I'm thinking these kids are just really, really, really, really, really fucked up.
6344258	6346140	Hold on, but the county sheriff actually said... So one question...
6367177	6371940	or Arpaio.
6372400	6375642	I'm not sure if it's the boy's parents or something.
6376102	6379504	It says, this game allows players to kill cops and rape women.
6380064	6384167	It's a little wonder why they perpetrated such violence against a little animal.
6386148	6388189	YYR in our chat, it says, the parents are to blame.
6388209	6389450	They should have bought wireless controllers.
6392910	6393490	It doesn't matter.
6393510	6395451	They would have stoned it to death anyways.
6395511	6396752	Beckers is dying to say something.
6397312	6399773	Institutionalize your children.
6399833	6402835	They're going to grow up to be serial killers.
6402935	6405496	It has nothing to do with the video games.
6408537	6409758	This is coming from a mom.
6409818	6411979	Parents, this has nothing to do with video games.
6412019	6413379	This has everything to do with you.
6414000	6415380	Your genes did this.
6416721	6418602	Stop passing them on.
6421630	6428436	Your Hellspawn, Damian Light, did this.
6430098	6430999	I agree with Becky.
6431099	6431779	Padded room.
6433261	6434982	Or just give them a hammer and leave them in a room by themselves.
6435022	6435803	Now can we end the show?
6436163	6436824	Can we end the show now?
6437485	6437745	No!
6437845	6440768	Thank you for ending the show on dead kittens, you ass.
6441248	6443110	Hey, I gotta go home and hug my kitty.
6443130	6444931	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6446195	6449480	I have one thing that will make it all better.
6450381	6450942	Cookies.
6451443	6452184	Yay, cookies.
6452745	6454968	And on that note, we're going to go eat some cookies and end the show.
6455088	6455389	Good night.
6456269	6465474	Oh, and by the way, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, please tell two people you know about the program and help us spread the word, because as I mentioned earlier, it's really hard to stay afloat amongst all the commercialized and corporate shows out there.
6466254	6475759	Word of mouth, it rocks, and you rock when you leave us happy reviews, and join us for live shows on All Games Radio Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, but if you can't, hey, listen to our recorded shows too.
6475799	6479761	Send us an email sometime, because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
6479781	6480341	We'll see you next week.
6480822	6483503	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
