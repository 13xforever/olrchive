Tonight, December 14th, 2008, the Commodore 64 game returns to the Nintendo DS.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Nintendo faces yet another Wii lawsuit. Could a rez sequel be in the works?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.840
Sj100Matt says Shaq Fu versus Capcom.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.240
Alright guys, that's enough.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.000
That's enough versus Capcom jokes.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm done.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.240
Anything else you've been playing this week, Loki?

11:42.240 --> 11:47.420
Grand Theft Auto IV on PC, and it's still, it's weird, because I tried upgrading the

11:47.420 --> 11:53.760
RAM on my PC to four gigs, even though Windows can only see, like, two of it, but I was going

11:53.760 --> 11:57.800
to do it anyways, and I had a bad run with bad RAM from Fry's.

11:57.800 --> 12:02.240
Apparently, Fry's, they keep taking back, my defective RAM is just a stock return, and

12:02.240 --> 12:06.640
so they have, like, four that they keep swapping out, even though it's defective.

12:06.640 --> 12:10.680
So I stopped buying RAM there, because it's pointless, and it would have been too much

12:10.680 --> 12:15.080
of a pain in the ass to get, you know, to see it on my computer.

12:15.080 --> 12:21.320
So and that's being said, yeah, I haven't really been playing too much of Grand Theft

12:21.320 --> 12:25.640
Auto IV, since it's still kind of buggy, even though they patched it a little bit to fix

12:25.640 --> 12:30.880
some stuff, it's not enough, it doesn't support SLI yet, and that kind of pisses me off, because

12:30.880 --> 12:34.560
that's, you know, I spent the money for an extra video card, I want the games to fucking

12:34.560 --> 12:41.320
see it, and I mean, come on, it's like a standard nowadays, it's just lazy, damn lazy is what

12:41.320 --> 12:42.320
it is.

12:42.320 --> 12:46.720
Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, then my gaming week, kind of a lot of

12:46.720 --> 12:50.360
the same usual stuff, I've obviously been playing a lot of The Wrath of the Lich King,

12:50.360 --> 12:56.520
I have done a big, big thing in WoW this week, I respect for a long term basis, because we're

12:56.520 --> 13:00.560
so short on healers, just on the server in general, not just our guild, but the server,

13:00.560 --> 13:06.360
I'm no longer a boomkin, but I'm now a resto tree druid, and it's been a whole different

13:06.360 --> 13:10.000
game trying to play it as a healer, but I won't bore you with the specifics, and I think

13:10.000 --> 13:12.640
we have a WoW story coming up later.

13:12.640 --> 13:16.040
Also some other things I've been playing, some old standbys, Rock Band 2, I downloaded

13:16.040 --> 13:19.720
the new No Doubt album, because I like fun pop music, and then, you know, the nice thing

13:19.720 --> 13:23.240
I like about the album they picked by No Doubt is that they just picked the greatest hits

13:23.240 --> 13:28.000
album, so you don't have a lot of, you know, songs that you don't really know, and that's

13:28.000 --> 13:31.480
the problem with some of these album songs, is that in a party setting, they don't work

13:31.480 --> 13:36.400
very well, because you don't really know the songs, usually, that weren't, you know, the

13:36.400 --> 13:41.440
radio hits, but the cool thing is the No Doubt album, like, it's all songs you'd probably

13:41.440 --> 13:45.600
recognize if you listened to the radio in the 90s and early 2000s at all.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.560
So I had fun with that.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.640
I checked out Meteos Wars, I only checked out the demo, so I don't want to really review

13:50.640 --> 13:53.520
a full game based strictly off the demo.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.240
Graphics were a little minimalist in the stage I played, however, it's a fairly faithful

13:57.240 --> 13:58.240
translation.

13:58.240 --> 14:02.960
I was wondering how you would have the speed of the stylus in a game like Meteos Wars,

14:02.960 --> 14:05.480
but the way they did it was kind of neat.

14:05.480 --> 14:10.160
Instead of sliding the pieces up and down, you use triangle to move a piece up a row

14:10.160 --> 14:14.640
really fast, and you use, what, X, I'm sorry, triangles would be a PlayStation, I'm sorry,

14:14.640 --> 14:15.640
Y.

14:15.640 --> 14:19.760
You use Y to move a thing up really fast, you use A to move it down really fast.

14:19.760 --> 14:24.520
So that I thought was a neat way to control it, and it actually made the game pretty playable,

14:24.520 --> 14:29.360
but it's so different looking at it on a TV than having the pen in front of you, like,

14:29.360 --> 14:31.320
you really have to think about the game a different way.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
But it was fun.

14:32.320 --> 14:36.500
I probably will buy the full version a little later on, especially now that I finally got

14:36.500 --> 14:43.180
a bigger hard drive for the Xbox 360, I finally am replacing my 20 gig with a 120 gig drive

14:43.180 --> 14:47.200
after all this time, so I can rip some of my games to the drive.

14:47.200 --> 14:51.300
As far as other new games go, I did spend a little bit more time with Prince of Persia

14:51.300 --> 14:52.560
on the PlayStation 3.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.080
This is the brand new one by Ubisoft.

14:55.080 --> 15:00.440
It's very famous because it's kind of, I would say it's kind of left the old Prince of Persia

15:00.440 --> 15:05.560
games, like the Sands of Time, and look at those games behind, and now they have this

15:05.560 --> 15:09.880
more cel-shaded, I guess you could say like Okami type of art style going on.

15:09.880 --> 15:13.600
I don't know what you'd really call that, but it's a very different art style.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.920
And you know, I'm not usually a big fan of these platformer games.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.080
I actually really like Prince of Persia, I've had a lot of fun with it.

15:21.080 --> 15:25.480
I've kind of kept playing it, it's kind of held my interest.

15:25.480 --> 15:30.320
The scripting in the game is a little silly, but it's, you know what I mean, like it's

15:30.320 --> 15:33.800
got a silly sense of humor, but it's funny, you know, I don't know if you, did you play

15:33.800 --> 15:34.800
much of the game at all?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.800
I haven't played it at all yet.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.120
It's cheesy but good, you know, for a video game.

15:40.120 --> 15:47.800
And yeah, the thing I like about it so far is that it really does help out idiots like

15:47.800 --> 15:52.120
me in platformer games, because I'm really horrible at these 3D platformer games, you

15:52.120 --> 15:53.120
know?

15:53.120 --> 15:58.520
I grew up in a day where it was all 2D, you know, Mario Brothers, Super Mario World, and

15:58.520 --> 16:02.280
all this, and even the old school Prince of Persia is 2D, it's taken me a long time to

16:02.280 --> 16:03.480
really get used to 3D.

16:03.480 --> 16:06.400
I even still have problems with Mario 64, ok?

16:06.400 --> 16:09.720
But the thing I like about Prince of Persia is that they've done things in this game that

16:09.720 --> 16:13.880
make it really accessible to noobs, because like, the game really holds your hand for

16:13.880 --> 16:15.840
a long time.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.760
And what I also like about it is that even if you fall off a cliff, you don't really

16:19.760 --> 16:20.760
die.

16:20.760 --> 16:24.840
You have the chick as a crutch to kind of save you.

16:24.840 --> 16:28.560
And you know, I think a lot of hardcore gamers have been really turned off by that, but for

16:28.560 --> 16:32.360
me, I've kind of appreciated it, and it's kind of made me want to continue to play,

16:32.360 --> 16:37.240
because I don't lose massive amounts of time, because I don't know how to turn the freaking

16:37.240 --> 16:38.240
camera.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.800
And that's what Tigerclaw says, says, Sky, what about the fact that you cannot die in

16:41.800 --> 16:43.280
the game?

16:43.280 --> 16:46.640
You know, I suppose you have to kind of take that with a give and take.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.520
Again, for someone like me who gets really frustrated when I have to go all the way back

16:49.520 --> 16:53.080
in a game, I kind of like that fact.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.240
But I do realize, you know, the other side of it, that there's the challenge people that

16:56.240 --> 17:00.080
say, well, where's the challenge in it if you don't die, if you don't ever die?

17:00.080 --> 17:04.160
And I don't know, progress still feels a lot like challenge to me.

17:04.160 --> 17:08.120
You have to collect things, and you don't have to collect everything, you get light

17:08.120 --> 17:09.120
seeds.

17:09.120 --> 17:12.560
And you don't have to collect them all to progress to new areas, but you get a sense

17:12.560 --> 17:18.840
of accomplishment for collecting them all, so they've done other little things with it.

17:18.840 --> 17:21.360
I kind of enjoy it.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.920
I would recommend folks check it out.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.200
I thought kind of the fighting was fun, even though it was a lot of button mashing, but

17:27.200 --> 17:28.440
it's kind of cool tricks.

17:28.440 --> 17:33.480
And you know, my roommate and his partner, who neither one of them really play games,

17:33.480 --> 17:36.040
they were kind of watching me play Prince of Persia, and kind of like, oh, what's this?

17:36.040 --> 17:37.040
Oh, this looks neat.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.920
What is this you're doing?

17:38.920 --> 17:41.840
So it's kind of fun.

17:41.840 --> 17:46.380
Achievements are really, really easy, though, too, I noticed, at least, or the trophies

17:46.380 --> 17:47.380
or whatever.

17:47.380 --> 17:49.960
I noticed I unlocked a silver trophy really easy.

17:49.960 --> 17:54.520
I didn't have to do hardly anything, so kind of interesting.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.000
So that was pretty much it for new games I played this week.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.360
I'm hoping that I'll probably actually play Prince of Persia a lot more, try to play through

18:01.360 --> 18:02.360
the collision.

18:02.360 --> 18:07.320
They thought it was a Final Fantasy game, and I'm like, no, there's no, you know.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.520
I was going to ask you, did you try out Home?

18:11.520 --> 18:12.520
Did I try what?

18:12.520 --> 18:13.520
Home.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.800
Yes, I did try Sony Home.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.400
I did download Home.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.340
I played that for a little bit.

18:21.340 --> 18:28.200
You know, Home is one of those things that I think it was a really great idea, but this

18:28.200 --> 18:33.800
execution that we're seeing of it is kind of not that great.

18:33.800 --> 18:34.800
You know what I mean?

18:34.800 --> 18:40.900
Like, God, if you think Xbox Live is bad, the minute I logged into Home, I just started

18:40.900 --> 18:43.880
hearing every naughty word in the book.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.760
Just everything you'd hear on Xbox Live.

18:45.760 --> 18:51.200
I didn't even know that you could use microphones on Sony Home, but apparently you can.

18:51.200 --> 18:55.400
So yeah.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.400
I don't know.

18:56.400 --> 19:01.060
And again, it was also one of those things where it kind of caused the non-game playing

19:01.060 --> 19:03.720
people who come through this house to kind of look at the TV and go, what is this?

19:03.720 --> 19:04.720
This looks kind of neat.

19:04.720 --> 19:09.340
Like, they were watching me in the bowling alley, and all this stuff in the bowling alley

19:09.340 --> 19:10.340
is really stupid.

19:10.340 --> 19:13.440
Like, I tried playing one of the games in there, which was basically an overdone version

19:13.440 --> 19:17.560
of Breakout, you know, like just a redone version of that, but it's all free, you have

19:17.560 --> 19:20.960
to remember, so you can't expect that it's going to be anything that great, because they're

19:20.960 --> 19:25.680
going to nickel and dime you, like they're trying to do with the costumes and everything.

19:25.680 --> 19:31.600
This all being said, I do think there's potential here for something cool.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.600
Like I think there is, like, networking potential within Home.

19:35.600 --> 19:39.080
I'm kind of excited for the clubhouses to come out, because I would like for us to have

19:39.080 --> 19:42.600
like an OLR clubhouse, where we could boot idiots and things like that, and I think we

19:42.600 --> 19:45.120
could have a lot of fun with it.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.760
Here's my thing.

19:46.760 --> 19:51.040
Right now, it's just this clusterfuck of strangeness.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.320
I mean, honestly, it's what it is.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.320
I don't know how else to explain it.

19:53.320 --> 19:57.400
Now, do you think it's fair for them to be advertising this as like a feature of the

19:57.400 --> 20:01.080
PlayStation 3, since it is only in beta right now?

20:01.080 --> 20:05.240
I mean, they've been having it in commercials since, what, last year?

20:05.240 --> 20:07.520
I mean, I think that's kind of unfair.

20:07.520 --> 20:13.720
I will answer that question, but let me address this, because I got a private message, like,

20:13.720 --> 20:14.720
what is Home?

20:14.720 --> 20:18.880
Those of us that aren't as familiar with this, basically, Home is like a virtual world, and

20:18.880 --> 20:22.760
these types of things were especially big back in the late 90s, and then kind of caught

20:22.760 --> 20:26.520
a second wind with Second Life, but like when the whole virtual reality thing first came

20:26.520 --> 20:30.180
out, they used to have these chat programs, where you could be like a little virtual avatar,

20:30.180 --> 20:33.480
and you walk around a virtual world, and then, you know, Second Life kind of really took

20:33.480 --> 20:35.160
that to the next level on the PCs.

20:35.160 --> 20:39.840
Well, this is kind of Sony's version of Second Life, where you create a little version of

20:39.840 --> 20:40.840
yourself.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.960
You know, you can think of me, I guess, but it's a lot more realistic, and you literally,

20:43.960 --> 20:49.440
using your controllers, walk around an open area, where there's other people dancing,

20:49.440 --> 20:53.920
or talking, or interacting with each other, but then you can go into, like, a bowling

20:53.920 --> 20:58.040
alley, and you can walk up to a bowling machine, if they're not all full, which they usually

20:58.040 --> 21:02.260
are, and play bowling with other people, and interact with them that way, or you can walk

21:02.260 --> 21:03.260
up to an arcade machine.

21:03.260 --> 21:07.040
So it's kind of like, you know, it's like a virtual life.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.320
So it's kind of like a game, but it's not.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.640
I don't know if that makes any sense at all.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.160
It's their idea to try and, of a new networking thing.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.160
So.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.160
VXJSnacksV in chat says, Second Life is a construct.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.160
Home is a construct.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.160
All right.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.160
So now, what was your question?

21:23.160 --> 21:25.280
Home, is it fair to advertise it?

21:25.280 --> 21:26.600
Yeah.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.880
It's obvious that Sony wanted to do a lot more with this.

21:29.880 --> 21:30.920
It's not implemented yet.

21:30.920 --> 21:35.560
I'm not sure what's taken them so long, but maybe it's just like, again, it's one of those

21:35.560 --> 21:39.000
things where the ideas are coming faster than the reality of being able to program it in.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
So is it?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.480
I mean, technically, yeah, they can advertise it.

21:42.480 --> 21:46.480
I would equate it to when they advertise video games with nothing but the cut scenes from

21:46.480 --> 21:47.480
the game.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.480
Yeah.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.360
But that's basically, it's kind of the equivalent of that.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.360
To me.

21:52.360 --> 21:56.240
I mean, it's not, it's giving a little bit of a misinterpretation, but it's not anything

21:56.240 --> 21:58.760
anyone's already done, if that makes sense.

21:58.760 --> 21:59.760
Okay.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.760
So.

22:00.760 --> 22:01.760
What about you?

22:01.760 --> 22:02.760
Have you played Home at all?

22:02.760 --> 22:03.760
No.

22:03.760 --> 22:04.760
From what you've read about it.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.880
Honestly, if you've read about it online, you've probably gotten a pretty good sense

22:06.880 --> 22:08.240
of what it's all about.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.240
Honestly.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.240
Yeah.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.240
Do you think it's fair for them to use it in advertising?

22:11.240 --> 22:12.240
No.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.240
I don't.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
It's in beta.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.240
It's not even done.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.240
It's, to me, I mean.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.240
Isn't Gmail still in beta?

22:17.240 --> 22:18.240
Yeah.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.240
But it's functional.

22:19.240 --> 22:25.760
This, I would say, it's close to being functional, but it's not, it'd be like putting out a demo

22:25.760 --> 22:30.200
of a game or something like that, and then advertising that in a commercial for, like,

22:30.200 --> 22:34.240
you know, the PlayStation or something like that, like, play Killzone 2, oh, except it's

22:34.240 --> 22:35.240
not out.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.480
It's just a demo or something like that.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.480
I don't know.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.480
It's misleading.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.720
Not that anyone really gives a crap about, you know, their commercials, since, I mean,

22:42.720 --> 22:46.480
I think the sales number speaks for themselves, so, whatever.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.020
I just think it's kind of misleading.

22:48.020 --> 22:51.880
I think there's potential in Home, but it has yet to be unlocked.

22:51.880 --> 22:56.440
Also, the only other thing I want to say about Home is that it's a little confusing.

22:56.440 --> 23:01.640
I mean, the things about the Xbox and the, well, especially the Nintendo one, those are

23:01.640 --> 23:06.240
very easy to just kind of pop into and go, and, you know, obviously neither system has

23:06.240 --> 23:09.920
done something as ambitious as Home, but Home's kind of complicated.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.720
Like, it took me a minute to really kind of work through the menus and everything, and

23:12.720 --> 23:16.400
it really is, it's even more tough when not everything's available yet.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.680
That's the other kind of bummer about it.

23:19.680 --> 23:23.160
And Jason wants to correct that Gmail is no longer in beta.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.160
Gmail is official.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.160
Gmail Labs is beta add-ons.

23:26.160 --> 23:29.560
So there you go.

23:29.560 --> 23:30.560
Interesting comments from Chad.

23:30.560 --> 23:34.200
SSJ100Matt says, it's like calling Windows 3.1.1 a game.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.840
Yeah, I know.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.720
Home isn't really a game.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.080
It's like folding at home is not really a game either.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.080
It's a simulation.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.080
Yeah, it's a thing.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.240
No, I guess you could say it's a simulation.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.960
I don't know.

23:48.960 --> 23:53.360
So, all right, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping

23:53.360 --> 23:55.640
real quick, of which we don't have a whole lot of tonight.

23:55.640 --> 23:59.280
Just, you know, always check us out on MySpace at Orange Launch Radio or Facebook at the

23:59.280 --> 24:00.280
OL Army.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.840
Our Twitter is OLR.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.800
We're also on LiveJournal, Community Orange Lounge, and we always try to keep you updated.

24:05.800 --> 24:10.160
Today and on Latest and Greatest, although it's been kind of a busy past few months,

24:10.160 --> 24:13.840
so a lot of our internet presence has really slowed down, so sorry about that.

24:13.840 --> 24:17.800
But we're still trying to keep you going with the show and do what we always do, and hopefully

24:17.800 --> 24:20.600
2009 will be a little better.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.600
Maybe it'll be warmer.

24:21.600 --> 24:25.960
Oh, also, one thing you've got to see at home is that when you go into the theater, you

24:25.960 --> 24:30.320
just get to see an extended Twilight trailer playing on the screen over and over and over

24:30.320 --> 24:31.840
again.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.040
I haven't seen it, nor probably will I.

24:34.040 --> 24:38.200
It's very Mystery Science 3000-able.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.200
That would be funny.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.160
That's the type of stuff they should be using home for.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.600
See, that's why I say there's potential there.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.920
That doesn't necessarily mean Sony's going to ever unlock it.

24:46.920 --> 24:47.920
I'm just saying.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.920
There's potential.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.920
All right.

24:49.920 --> 24:50.920
All right.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.200
Let's get into some gaming news.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.920
Loki, start us off.

24:54.920 --> 25:00.680
Yes, speaking of Sony, Sony has been seeing some hard times, and they're actually cutting

25:00.680 --> 25:05.600
plants and, with that, slashing 8,000 jobs.

25:05.600 --> 25:12.280
This is all supposed to happen between now and April of 2010, and Sony will cut about

25:12.280 --> 25:18.920
5% of their electronics divisions and close a tenth of its manufacturing sites.

25:18.920 --> 25:23.360
That's not good, especially in this tough economy.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.560
But, hmm.

25:25.560 --> 25:26.560
That's kind of sad.

25:26.560 --> 25:31.560
I mean, is it just because PS3s haven't been selling well, or is it that now they don't

25:31.560 --> 25:34.480
need these people because the PS3's already out, or what?

25:34.480 --> 25:37.600
I think it's just because they haven't been selling well, because there's no need to have

25:37.600 --> 25:42.040
these extra plants producing more systems if they're not selling out.

25:42.040 --> 25:46.080
They're not having an issue with selling out at all.

25:46.080 --> 25:51.760
Although they are, at times, hard to find, just because they keep phasing out skews left

25:51.760 --> 25:52.760
and right.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.760
I mean, crap.

25:53.760 --> 26:00.480
I mean, this year alone, there's been four different skews for the PS3.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.200
I mean, that's kind of crazy right there.

26:02.200 --> 26:06.120
Well, that's four new skews, and that's not even including the ones that we came in this

26:06.120 --> 26:08.320
year with.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.760
I don't know.

26:10.760 --> 26:14.080
This is kind of related, but it kind of goes back to what we were talking about with Home.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.040
I really want to read this comment, because it's interesting.

26:16.040 --> 26:20.640
Frisbee says in chat, the Dark Knight DVD has an MST3K feature in it, and Tiger Claw

26:20.640 --> 26:25.280
says, kind of fills that out a little bit, says, actually, the Blu-ray version of the

26:25.280 --> 26:30.400
Dark Knight has a BD Live feature that allows you to do fan commentaries using a webcam

26:30.400 --> 26:31.840
with a PS3.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.400
Once you finish the commentary, it gets uploaded to the servers for others to be able to watch

26:35.400 --> 26:37.000
the movie with.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.260
That's kind of strange.

26:39.260 --> 26:41.360
It's neat.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.480
That's kind of cool with the whole BD Live thing.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.680
So I mean, that's...

26:45.680 --> 26:48.320
I haven't really watched any Blu-rays that have the BD Live.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.280
You know, one thing I did watch, though, was on Netflix.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.280
I watched King of Kong this week.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.280
Finally.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.280
God, how long has that movie been out?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.280
Like a year.

26:56.280 --> 27:00.360
I finally watched King of Kong this week, which is in HD on the Netflix thing on 360,

27:00.360 --> 27:02.000
which I thought was pretty cool.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.580
And wow.

27:04.580 --> 27:07.420
What an interesting movie.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.520
That's really the only word I can use to describe it as interesting.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.280
Certain people are kind of dicks.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.480
The drama is still playing out.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.280
Here's the thing, though.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.080
God, how far do I want to get into this on the show?

27:19.080 --> 27:23.300
Especially when we were just talking about something completely different, and I apologize.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.320
It's very sad that people lost their jobs, but unfortunately we don't know much more

27:26.320 --> 27:27.680
than that at this time about it.

27:27.680 --> 27:31.120
So here we are on this whole other subject.

27:31.120 --> 27:37.440
You gotta kind of wonder, like with this movie, how biased is it trying to be?

27:37.440 --> 27:42.720
And I'm not trying to say that Billy Mitchell is not likely the pompous ass he made himself

27:42.720 --> 27:45.280
to be in the movie, but I don't know.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.860
There's something about it.

27:46.860 --> 27:50.400
Something about the fact that they had all these cameras in just the right places at

27:50.400 --> 27:53.560
just the right times when all these things were going on.

27:53.560 --> 28:01.720
There's something about it that says there's some type of editing stuff going on here.

28:01.720 --> 28:02.720
I don't know.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.600
But then at the same time, I know a lot of our folks listen to the other shows on All

28:05.600 --> 28:12.040
Games, and you've probably heard all this crap about the Twin Galaxies and Mr. Awesome's

28:12.040 --> 28:15.760
been on All Games off and on throughout the years, and all this crap going on with Twin

28:15.760 --> 28:16.760
Galaxies.

28:16.760 --> 28:21.400
And it just kind of goes to show you, this drama has been going on for years and is continuing

28:21.400 --> 28:22.720
even still today.

28:22.720 --> 28:26.960
Not just with Donkey Kong, but with the official scores in general.

28:26.960 --> 28:31.000
And it's just kind of, I don't know, it's a very ambitious topic.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.880
But again, my roommate who doesn't play a lot of games watched most of the movie with

28:34.880 --> 28:35.880
me.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.720
He kind of had his head in his laptop when he was watching the movie, and he was just

28:37.720 --> 28:41.240
kind of like, all of these people are sad.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.240
These people are all sad.

28:42.240 --> 28:45.800
And I'm kind of like, well, wait a minute, though.

28:45.800 --> 28:50.080
He's like, well, not the Steve Weeby guy seems pretty cool or whatever, and his family's

28:50.080 --> 28:51.080
pretty funny.

28:51.080 --> 28:55.040
But most of the people in the movie are very sad individuals, like Billy and his lackeys

28:55.040 --> 28:56.440
and all that stuff.

28:56.440 --> 28:57.440
And I'm kind of like, well...

28:57.440 --> 29:01.760
But Billy Mitchell actually owns his own business and makes his...

29:01.760 --> 29:07.040
I'm saying he's still an ass, but he's a successful businessman.

29:07.040 --> 29:10.080
Yeah, it's interesting.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.840
Petty, yes.

29:11.840 --> 29:12.840
He's petty.

29:12.840 --> 29:13.840
That's a good word.

29:13.840 --> 29:14.840
That's a good word.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.360
But successful and not stupid.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.840
Like the whole thing where he sends a tape in.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.120
Did you see the movie?

29:21.120 --> 29:22.120
Several times.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.120
Okay, he sends the tape in.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.200
The King of Kong was a very good movie.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.880
He sent the tape in and all this stuff.

29:25.880 --> 29:29.000
Like, did you notice, they have a camera at his house when he sends in the tape.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
They have a camera there.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.800
They have the camera with Grandma at the airport.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.040
I'm kind of like, this seems all way too pre-planned for me.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.580
That was the only problem I had with the movie, is it seemed...

29:37.580 --> 29:43.280
This documentary was really well done.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.320
Like almost too well done.

29:45.320 --> 29:46.320
I don't know.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.320
It was weird.

29:47.320 --> 29:58.360
Well, I also do see him as being rather pompous enough to want to tape everything.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.360
But here's the thing.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.360
Here's what I was going to say.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.000
And this is what I was kind of going to tell my roommate about too.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.440
You see these kind of pompous asses in lots of sports.

30:06.440 --> 30:11.560
Like you ever watch some of these football press conferences or wrestling or boxing?

30:11.560 --> 30:15.960
I mean, some of us cheer on these pompous assholes in wrestling.

30:15.960 --> 30:17.120
You know what I mean?

30:17.120 --> 30:22.340
So in a way, I don't hate the guy or, you know, I do kind of, you know, he did come

30:22.340 --> 30:27.720
off like a pompous ass in the movie, but you know, maybe there's more to him than that.

30:27.720 --> 30:28.720
I don't know.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.720
Just interesting.

30:29.720 --> 30:30.720
It's...

30:30.720 --> 30:31.720
Yeah.

30:31.720 --> 30:35.280
And then you look at some of these side stories going on.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.240
Like the whole, like, you know, Mr. Awesome Missile Command.

30:37.240 --> 30:42.160
I never realized, I never, and keep in mind, I've been watching this whole thing play out

30:42.160 --> 30:43.160
on all games.

30:43.160 --> 30:47.240
I never realized that he had the direct impact on that movie by sending the guy the Donkey

30:47.240 --> 30:49.320
Kong board that he did.

30:49.320 --> 30:53.640
And just to kind of see, like literally, I was just kind of like, wow, a lot of this

30:53.640 --> 30:56.400
makes sense now, what I've been hearing on all games.

30:56.400 --> 31:02.840
Like damn, these people and their drama over scores, but I don't know.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.280
It's all they've got.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.280
I...

31:05.280 --> 31:06.280
It's...

31:06.280 --> 31:07.280
I know, I know.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.280
I don't fault them for it.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.280
I don't think they're sad people.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.840
It's what they're into.

31:10.840 --> 31:11.840
You know, it's...

31:11.840 --> 31:12.840
I think it's just...

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
Oh.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.840
I don't know.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
It hurts my head to think about it.

31:15.840 --> 31:16.840
It almost like makes you wonder.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.160
It's like, okay, so say you have it.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.520
And you know who I blame even more to?

31:21.520 --> 31:25.400
It's the fucking Guinness Book of World Records, because they're not helping things.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.960
Now putting out this stupid gaming book and stuff.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.200
They're just egging it on.

31:29.200 --> 31:33.260
And not only that, but they have stupid, you know, records in there, like people that claim

31:33.260 --> 31:37.480
to have the highest score in DDR, a game that I don't think that you can have a high score

31:37.480 --> 31:38.480
in.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.480
It's just...

31:39.480 --> 31:40.480
I don't know.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.480
It's so subjective.

31:41.480 --> 31:42.840
Forgive my ignorance here.

31:42.840 --> 31:43.840
I don't know.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.100
I plain don't know the answer to this.

31:45.100 --> 31:46.100
Maybe the chat does.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.440
Does anyone audit Twin Galaxies?

31:48.440 --> 31:52.360
That's the only kind of thing I had with them, is that, you know, yes, you know, they talk

31:52.360 --> 31:57.320
about integrity and all this, but obviously the movie showed questionable integrity on

31:57.320 --> 32:01.540
the part of Twin Galaxies, whether that was creative editing or not, whatevs.

32:01.540 --> 32:03.360
But does anybody audit Twin Galaxies?

32:03.360 --> 32:06.160
You know, especially if there are things that are going to be in the Guinness Book of World

32:06.160 --> 32:07.720
Records and what have you.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.160
Does Guinness audit them?

32:09.160 --> 32:13.440
Guinness would, because they have, like, you know, they're strict regulations for how they

32:13.440 --> 32:14.440
do things.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.880
I don't think they would just take Twin Galaxies' word for it.

32:16.880 --> 32:21.000
I mean, they'd have someone standing there recording all the data that's necessary.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.200
At least that's how they do everything else, and I would think that they would have the

32:24.200 --> 32:29.840
same integrity, since, you know, their name, you know, has a lot of writing on it.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.840
So...

32:30.840 --> 32:34.480
And, you know, I understand, you know, I understand why people get all into it, because, like,

32:34.480 --> 32:38.000
you know, I think one guy who was, like, a friend of Steve Levy or something said it

32:38.000 --> 32:39.280
best in the movie.

32:39.280 --> 32:45.240
This guy, my friend Steve, is the best in the world at something, in the entire world.

32:45.240 --> 32:49.680
And true, it might be Donkey Kong, but he's the best in the world.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.760
And you know, I can see why people get so passionate about that.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.480
Did you see him play through the kill screen?

32:53.480 --> 32:54.480
Yeah.

32:54.480 --> 32:55.480
That was pretty sweet.

32:55.480 --> 32:56.480
Yeah.

32:56.480 --> 33:02.160
I was playing through the kill screen once, once, and I was little, so...

33:02.160 --> 33:08.560
All right, anyhow, sorry, a total tangent that took up more time than the much-

33:08.560 --> 33:09.680
It's a cool tangent.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.960
It's gaming and not food.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.960
Much sadder story.

33:11.960 --> 33:15.640
Speaking of food, though, I ate at Olive Garden today, home of the never-ending breadsticks.

33:15.640 --> 33:20.600
I'm sorry I didn't invite you, Jamie, I just, it was a last-minute thing, but that's the

33:20.600 --> 33:23.240
first time I've had it since the surgery and everything.

33:23.240 --> 33:27.880
Sorry, bad tangent, especially following a story about such horrible layoffs as Sony,

33:27.880 --> 33:31.040
but unfortunately we don't have a lot more to tell you there.

33:31.040 --> 33:36.160
All right, let's talk about sales, and maybe this might help explain kind of the Sony layoffs

33:36.160 --> 33:37.160
and so on.

33:37.160 --> 33:42.600
Some of the November numbers from MPD are in, talking about the sales, and the Wii in

33:42.600 --> 33:46.760
November sold 2.04 million units, probably no one's surprised.

33:46.760 --> 33:51.000
The DS in second place, 1.57 million units.

33:51.000 --> 34:04.760
Xbox 360, 836K, PSP, 421K, PS3, 378K, PlayStation 2 is finally in last place, 206K.

34:04.760 --> 34:09.020
So this might finally be the PS2 kind of walking out the door here.

34:09.020 --> 34:12.360
But it's kind of strange that the PS3, you know, is-

34:12.360 --> 34:18.920
The PS2 is definitely on its way out, it's not, I'd say maybe by the end of next year,

34:18.920 --> 34:24.920
because I mean, looking just at what the releases are, like for example, in February, there

34:24.920 --> 34:29.200
are three games coming out for the PS2, and that is it.

34:29.200 --> 34:38.880
In January, I think two or three also coming out, so it's getting a lot less prevalent,

34:38.880 --> 34:45.920
but I think by the end of next year, you'll see most games have already moved on to the

34:45.920 --> 34:46.920
new platforms.

34:46.920 --> 34:51.920
And we see the PSP sold more than the PS3, which is, you know, well, it's a cheaper system.

34:51.920 --> 34:57.200
And they were also just coming out with the new PS3, or PSP 3000s.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.600
Float Walkin' Chat says people buy PSP still?

34:59.600 --> 35:03.880
Yeah, because, you know, they are, you know, it isn't just a game system, but it's, you

35:03.880 --> 35:10.120
know, the whole movies and internet and MP3s in your pocket, so it's-

35:10.120 --> 35:11.760
But they are released.

35:11.760 --> 35:15.400
Sadly enough, a lot of the publishers are just not making PSP games anymore.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.400
Yeah.

35:16.400 --> 35:20.560
And a lot of games coming out is really sad, and it's not a good sign.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.160
Why do you think everyone jumps ships suddenly?

35:22.160 --> 35:23.160
Just sales?

35:23.160 --> 35:24.160
Just sales numbers.

35:24.160 --> 35:28.580
They put out a PSP version of their game, and either development takes too long, or,

35:28.580 --> 35:29.800
you know, it just doesn't sell.

35:29.800 --> 35:33.920
Like, I've noticed a lot with, you know, like Crash of the Titans, for example, came out

35:33.920 --> 35:38.600
at the beginning of October on, you know, all the other systems, it came out a few weeks

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
later on the PSP.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.040
You know, the PSP versions are getting delayed.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.040
I don't know why.

35:43.040 --> 35:48.960
I mean, I can't imagine it's that hard a program for it, but it's just, they don't sell very

35:48.960 --> 35:49.960
well.

35:49.960 --> 35:50.960
Their versions aren't very good.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.000
It's just, they all have the install base for it.

35:54.000 --> 36:00.080
People are playing DSs more, which, you know, there's a lot of good PSP games, it's just,

36:00.080 --> 36:01.080
I don't know.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.200
It's gonna take some really good PSP games.

36:04.200 --> 36:08.520
It does sound like, though, Sony has some plans of what they're gonna do to maybe drive

36:08.520 --> 36:12.020
more PSP sales, and they're definitely not giving up on it, you know, with the whole

36:12.020 --> 36:14.600
rumors with LittleBigPlanet and MotorStorm.

36:14.600 --> 36:19.200
You know, we know Dissida's coming out next year, probably sometime.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.880
So those are three big games right there.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.680
You know, I wonder if the Final Fantasy VII remake that people always have big boners

36:26.680 --> 36:30.200
talking about on the PlayStation 3, like, you know, big fan-gasm, you know, talking

36:30.200 --> 36:31.640
about they want it to happen on PlayStation 3.

36:31.640 --> 36:35.080
I wonder if they wouldn't do something like that for PSP.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.600
I wouldn't think it'd be very good.

36:36.600 --> 36:42.800
They could bring the Final Fantasy VII, maybe redo some of the graphics a little bit, but,

36:42.800 --> 36:46.880
you know, like a high-quality remake like you saw the little teaser video for, I think

36:46.880 --> 36:48.160
they'll have to be on the PS3.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.160
Eh, crazy thought.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.520
Let me recap the ten games that sold the best November.

36:51.520 --> 36:55.720
This gives you a really good idea of what's gonna wind up under trees at Christmas time,

36:55.720 --> 37:01.280
and what I like about this list is it really is a mixture of big releases getting sold

37:01.280 --> 37:04.900
on their day of release and things that are gonna be under the Christmas tree.

37:04.900 --> 37:10.080
Number ten was Wii Music, on the Wii, which, you know, kind of contradicts that story we

37:10.080 --> 37:13.300
had a couple weeks ago that wasn't selling very well, because it was the tenth best-selling

37:13.300 --> 37:15.120
game in November.

37:15.120 --> 37:20.440
Maybe didn't hit the millions and millions of expectations, but, I mean, the tenth best-selling

37:20.440 --> 37:22.920
game out of everything that's out there, that's not that bad.

37:22.920 --> 37:23.920
No?

37:23.920 --> 37:24.920
Right?

37:24.920 --> 37:29.800
Well, then also I think last, the last report we saw for the NPD numbers, it was only out

37:29.800 --> 37:34.000
for like a week, so that's not necessarily a bad thing.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Ninth place, I'm sorry?

37:35.000 --> 37:39.440
I was gonna say, it definitely isn't selling as well as some of the other Wii games, let

37:39.440 --> 37:41.440
me put it that way, though.

37:41.440 --> 37:45.020
Ninth, well, there's only five Wii games on this list, so it's the fifth best-selling

37:45.020 --> 37:49.200
Wii games, and when we talk about what Wii games are selling, it's old shit, so, I don't

37:49.200 --> 37:51.120
know, it's in, you know, I...

37:51.120 --> 37:54.120
I can probably have explanations for most of these, so go ahead.

37:54.120 --> 37:58.640
Number nine was Resistance 2 on the PlayStation 3, which, you know, is PS3's, one of their

37:58.640 --> 38:00.360
big titles.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.400
Number eight was Left 4 Dead on the Xbox 360.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.400
I really need to pick that game up.

38:03.400 --> 38:06.560
That game's been performing above expectations, right?

38:06.560 --> 38:07.560
Yeah.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.560
I'm doing very well.

38:08.560 --> 38:11.840
Number seven was Guitar Hero World Tour on the Wii.

38:11.840 --> 38:15.160
Number six was Call of Duty World of War on the PS3.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.320
Number five was Mario Kart on the Wii.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.320
You know why?

38:18.320 --> 38:19.400
That game's still short-handed.

38:19.400 --> 38:23.360
People are still trying to get it because they've either artificially made it short

38:23.360 --> 38:26.000
for it, or whatever the case may be.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.160
It's been hard to get in, let me put it that way.

38:28.160 --> 38:31.400
Well, I was just also guessing that's a game that's gonna be under Christmas trees everywhere.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.400
Oh, yeah.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.400
That's a game that sells.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.720
I mean, even on DS, it's still very popular.

38:35.720 --> 38:37.080
Number four, Wii Fit.

38:37.080 --> 38:40.240
Also another thing that's very short and hard to find.

38:40.240 --> 38:43.060
Number three, Wii Play with the remote.

38:43.060 --> 38:47.040
People just sell that like a remote, and hey, you get a $10 game.

38:47.040 --> 38:51.720
That's gotta be why this game is still chopping the charts.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.080
That's exactly why it's doing it.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.080
It's because you get a remote.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.840
I mean, it's an easy sell.

38:55.840 --> 39:00.080
It's like you either buy a $40 remote, or for an extra $10, you get a game that's just

39:00.080 --> 39:01.320
like Wii Sports.

39:01.320 --> 39:06.040
And I bet parents everywhere are looking at this going, oh, cool, and putting it for the

39:06.040 --> 39:07.040
kids.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.040
Exactly.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.040
That's gotta be it.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.000
Number two, Call of Duty World of War, the 360 version.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.520
And then number one would be Gears of War 2 on the Xbox 360.

39:15.520 --> 39:19.400
But I should point out, if you add up the two Call of Duty World of Wars across 360

39:19.400 --> 39:22.680
and PS3, that would be number one, not Gears of War 2.

39:22.680 --> 39:28.160
But Gears of War 2 being Xbox 360 exclusive only has the one system to consider.

39:28.160 --> 39:31.680
So just interesting.

39:31.680 --> 39:32.680
Interesting list.

39:32.680 --> 39:33.680
There you go.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.120
Your November NPD numbers.

39:35.120 --> 39:41.280
Well, for people like me who have an iPhone, there is some fun out there, although I've

39:41.280 --> 39:44.000
been hearing mixed reviews on it.

39:44.000 --> 39:49.280
There is I Love Katamari, which is actually I Love Katamari on the iPhone.

39:49.280 --> 39:55.360
It's $7.99, and you can either play it on the iPhone or the iPod Touch.

39:55.360 --> 40:01.680
And it's 82 meg, has a story, time attack, eternal and exact size.

40:01.680 --> 40:07.200
And it apparently suffers really bad from the iPhone's poor frame rate for games, but

40:07.200 --> 40:11.160
I figured I might download it eventually.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.680
The last game I actually paid for was Pole Position.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.600
I was gonna check it out, but then I read the reviews, and they all were bitching about

40:17.600 --> 40:18.600
the frame rate.

40:18.600 --> 40:19.600
And I was like, okay, maybe this isn't so cool.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.320
Yeah, but that's just iPhone games anyway.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.920
You look at any review on an iPhone game, they're gonna talk about the frame rate unless

40:24.920 --> 40:27.800
it's something, you know, dinky like Pac-Man.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.800
Or Labyrinth, which is what I play all the time.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.160
It doesn't matter, though.

40:32.160 --> 40:36.280
I don't think, that's like bitching about the frame rate on any system.

40:36.280 --> 40:41.640
I can't say that that's a reason to even put out a game then, oh, I can't get the frame

40:41.640 --> 40:42.640
rate up where I need to be.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.560
Well, then you can't release the game.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.140
You can't get it up.

40:47.140 --> 40:53.640
You have to make some sort of, like, you know, omissions, you know, for, I don't know whether

40:53.640 --> 40:58.480
it be, like, you just use, like, cel-shading, you know, with really flat textures, so that,

40:58.480 --> 41:04.040
you know, the size of the textures isn't really big, and so it's able to render it faster,

41:04.040 --> 41:09.000
or I don't know, you know, they're trying to push the iPhone as, like, this big gaming

41:09.000 --> 41:14.760
platform, and yeah, unfortunately to me, that's almost like pushing the N-Gage as a big gaming

41:14.760 --> 41:15.760
platform.

41:15.760 --> 41:18.440
No, no, no, no, no, no.

41:18.440 --> 41:23.800
First of all, games look a jillion times better on the iPhone than they did on the N-Gage,

41:23.800 --> 41:28.000
and I had a great gaming taco, I understand this.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.040
On top of that, there's so much more functionality with the iPhone that comparing it to that

41:33.040 --> 41:41.640
waste of electronics that was the N-Gage is seriously, like, comparing, I would have to

41:41.640 --> 41:48.040
say a Blackberry with one of those old car phones, you know, that you had to attach to

41:48.040 --> 41:51.560
your cigarette lighter and was the size of your head.

41:51.560 --> 41:57.040
Here's my thing, is they, well, they're trying to be like a gaming platform, I mean, that's

41:57.040 --> 42:00.920
what they keep saying is, like, they're, you know, one of the best gaming platforms out

42:00.920 --> 42:06.960
there, which, I don't know how they can claim that, but they are.

42:06.960 --> 42:11.080
I think if, you know, it's funny, if Nintendo had almost, like, taken the same idea and

42:11.080 --> 42:16.880
just done almost, like, what XNA is doing, and opened that up to people to release apps

42:16.880 --> 42:21.200
for, like, the DS, can you imagine how much money they'd make?

42:21.200 --> 42:23.200
It's just ridiculous.

42:23.200 --> 42:27.440
But it's the same thing there, and I can't even really call them a gaming platform anyways,

42:27.440 --> 42:32.280
because for me, a game console is something that you can actually buy games for, not necessarily

42:32.280 --> 42:37.400
just digital downloads, and I know that's the future of stuff, but I'm just not seeing

42:37.400 --> 42:38.400
it.

42:38.400 --> 42:43.920
I just, I think it's more casual, I don't know, I don't think it's ever going to take

42:43.920 --> 42:46.800
the place of a handheld game system.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.560
I want to read this comment real quick from AlphaKananagram in chat.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.800
I love Katamari, in its current build, is the worst eight bucks I've spent.

42:53.800 --> 42:54.800
It's neat, but slow.

42:54.800 --> 43:00.160
Oh, there you go, a listener review of the game.

43:00.160 --> 43:04.240
All right, let's move on.

43:04.240 --> 43:08.440
Okay, so some other cool stuff.

43:08.440 --> 43:12.560
We talked about this a little bit, you know, Home has finally made its way out, or at least

43:12.560 --> 43:15.000
the beta of it.

43:15.000 --> 43:24.320
It is a 77 meg download, however, you do need to have, I believe, three gigs dedicated to

43:24.320 --> 43:25.320
this.

43:25.320 --> 43:29.200
Yeah, when you start it up, it says that you have to dedicate three gigs of your drive

43:29.200 --> 43:34.280
to the game, and it says okay, and then you basically, it partitions off a part of the

43:34.280 --> 43:35.280
drive for it.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.280
I don't know what it's doing.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.280
It reserves a part of the drive.

43:37.280 --> 43:40.280
That's because you're downloading new areas as you go.

43:40.280 --> 43:41.400
You can go in there and download new stuff.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.360
I'm not sure what it's all used for.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.520
I don't know if it's caching data or something.

43:45.520 --> 43:49.560
I think it's storage of the actual areas and stuff like that, probably the video.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.440
Areas aren't that big.

43:51.440 --> 43:56.860
The funny thing is, when you start Home, okay, then you get your apartment, but then you

43:56.860 --> 44:00.840
have to download the central area, which is like 70 megs, and you have to download the

44:00.840 --> 44:02.960
theater if you want to go in the theater, which is 40 megs.

44:02.960 --> 44:05.040
You have to download the bowling alley, which is another 40 megs.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.040
I don't know why they just didn't do it all at once.

44:07.040 --> 44:10.520
Yeah, that part did seem a little silly to me, but whatever.

44:10.520 --> 44:14.120
You just do it, and it doesn't take that long on a high-speed connection, which you're using

44:14.120 --> 44:16.760
to play these things anyway.

44:16.760 --> 44:20.200
Maybe it was so that you don't download stuff you don't need, but I just figured the 3 gigs

44:20.200 --> 44:21.200
was some type of cache information.

44:21.200 --> 44:24.680
It's probably so that their servers don't crash from everybody downloading it all at

44:24.680 --> 44:29.520
once, and that way, it saves them a little bit of time, and then that way, every time

44:29.520 --> 44:32.240
it goes in there, it checks to see if there's any updates to it.

44:32.240 --> 44:36.760
Kind of like, remember how AOL was, how you'd go to different pages and you'd download updates?

44:36.760 --> 44:38.560
It's kind of like that.

44:38.560 --> 44:41.120
So it is available right now.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.440
You can check it out.

44:42.440 --> 44:47.600
However, there are issues, and obviously, they've been having trouble with it staying

44:47.600 --> 44:52.820
online, and they've had to actually shut down the PlayStation Network for about an hour

44:52.820 --> 44:55.920
to fix stuff, and yeah.

44:55.920 --> 45:04.360
So it's definitely acting like it was in beta, but it's available to check out, and it's

45:04.360 --> 45:05.800
been a long time coming.

45:05.800 --> 45:10.000
Weren't they having a lot of issues on launch day with the downloads?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Yeah.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Like, I heard, yeah.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
But I don't know.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.080
I got in there very easily, but I didn't remember it was out until, like, late in the evening.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.880
I think I'd been watching a movie, and then I was like, oh yeah, I want to download Home.

45:19.880 --> 45:21.400
Yeah, I'm not going to try it for a while.

45:21.400 --> 45:25.960
I just haven't gotten, I'm not really gung-ho to jump into it.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.160
It just kind of, eh.

45:27.160 --> 45:33.920
It was like the avatars for me, you know, just like on the new Xbox experience or whatever.

45:33.920 --> 45:35.960
It was kind of neat, made my avatar.

45:35.960 --> 45:40.040
That's it, you know, whatever.

45:40.040 --> 45:41.040
Question from Chatroom.

45:41.040 --> 45:42.040
Tigerclaw asks, interesting.

45:42.040 --> 45:45.760
Does it let you walk around the world as it downloads in the backgrounds and stuff?

45:45.760 --> 45:48.560
It's kind of annoying when you're walking in an environment that appears empty, and

45:48.560 --> 45:51.480
then about a minute later, everything suddenly appears, and you appear to have run into a

45:51.480 --> 45:52.480
wall.

45:52.480 --> 45:55.080
No, it doesn't do that with the environments.

45:55.080 --> 45:58.000
That's why you have to download everything before you go in.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.680
So it doesn't actually download the environment as you go.

46:00.680 --> 46:04.840
It will download as you go, like the movie that's playing in the movie theater, like

46:04.840 --> 46:06.400
the Twilight trailer or whatever.

46:06.400 --> 46:09.720
You have to wait for that to download before you're going to see it on the screen.

46:09.720 --> 46:14.160
But what's kind of sad about that is that there's nothing to do in that theater otherwise.

46:14.160 --> 46:18.440
I mean, people are there sitting in seats talking and saying all these things you really

46:18.440 --> 46:20.760
don't even need to read anyway.

46:20.760 --> 46:21.760
That's just lame.

46:21.760 --> 46:26.320
But, I don't know, there's really not a lot of point to it.

46:26.320 --> 46:31.960
Now remember when Home was going to let me show whatever movie I wanted to on my screen

46:31.960 --> 46:32.960
in my home?

46:32.960 --> 46:33.960
Like, remember that?

46:33.960 --> 46:34.960
Yeah.

46:34.960 --> 46:35.960
We were supposed to have that?

46:35.960 --> 46:36.960
Now that would have been cool.

46:36.960 --> 46:40.280
Yeah, I think they got rid of that because of licensing.

46:40.280 --> 46:44.040
I know, because you'd think people would put up porn and what have you.

46:44.040 --> 46:47.240
No, I think they weren't even caring about porn, they were caring about people putting

46:47.240 --> 46:48.240
up like, say, a fight.

46:48.240 --> 46:49.440
Okay, so copyrighted porn.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.440
Yeah.

46:50.440 --> 46:51.440
Okay.

46:51.440 --> 46:54.240
But imagine if we could have had an OLR clubhouse, and we could have shot like some video just

46:54.240 --> 46:58.640
for fun that could loop in the clubhouse or something that we could have had in there

46:58.640 --> 47:01.360
just for fun and change it out once a week or something.

47:01.360 --> 47:07.160
That would be great, and that's potential, but I just know that's not going to happen

47:07.160 --> 47:08.160
for years.

47:08.160 --> 47:17.400
Now is that something like, what is it, where you have to be, do you have to be like, logged

47:17.400 --> 47:21.600
into that, your account or something like that for someone to be able to jump into your

47:21.600 --> 47:22.600
clubhouse?

47:22.600 --> 47:23.600
Or is it just-

47:23.600 --> 47:24.600
It's not available yet.

47:24.600 --> 47:25.600
Yeah.

47:25.600 --> 47:26.760
And you're going to have to pay for them when they do come out.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.960
I mean, if it's just a small fee, I don't mind paying it just to kind of screw around

47:29.960 --> 47:34.760
with it, you know, because I think there's potential to, you know, kind of have the community

47:34.760 --> 47:37.960
there and, you know, we're all about community here at OLR.

47:37.960 --> 47:44.240
But I want to know a little more about what you can actually do with it, because it seems

47:44.240 --> 47:45.560
like it's going to be a little limiting.

47:45.560 --> 47:48.480
And I don't know if I would have to be on or not, but the PS3 is also one of those systems

47:48.480 --> 47:51.600
you can kind of just leave on, and it doesn't make any noise or nothing.

47:51.600 --> 47:57.520
If you could, like, hook up a PS3 in here, and then broadcast our show into that clubhouse

47:57.520 --> 47:59.520
and have us on the TV.

47:59.520 --> 48:00.520
That's what I was thinking!

48:00.520 --> 48:02.200
Like, wouldn't that be an awesome potential?

48:02.200 --> 48:03.200
That would be awesome.

48:03.200 --> 48:07.440
Like, if we could actually, because if you can talk through your headset, then that thing

48:07.440 --> 48:11.120
supports streaming audio, and I'm sure there would be a way that during the duration of

48:11.120 --> 48:13.560
the show we could just shut everyone else up.

48:13.560 --> 48:16.560
We shouldn't be giving away all our ideas, other podcasts are going to steal them.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.560
Eh, whatever.

48:17.560 --> 48:19.440
Wouldn't be the first time.

48:19.440 --> 48:24.200
But, you know, that's kind of like the idea I would want to do.

48:24.200 --> 48:29.640
So there's potential there, but I don't know.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.400
Jason says, you can create a club at home and it will cost $5.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.000
Can you actually do that now?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.300
When I tried to look at it, you couldn't do it.

48:36.300 --> 48:41.680
Did they actually open that up and I just couldn't figure it out?

48:41.680 --> 48:43.780
Tigerclaw says, this is why Second Life does it better.

48:43.780 --> 48:47.200
You can actually create a club, invite people to come over, and the club will actually play

48:47.200 --> 48:50.240
music in the background by streaming a shotcast stream into it.

48:50.240 --> 48:54.080
Maybe we should have put a thing in Second Life a long time ago, but it was kind of expensive,

48:54.080 --> 48:55.080
wasn't it?

48:55.080 --> 48:56.080
I don't remember.

48:56.080 --> 48:57.080
It's Second Life, I don't want to touch that.

48:57.080 --> 48:58.080
It's like, dirty.

48:58.080 --> 48:59.440
Well, home's not much better then.

48:59.440 --> 49:05.240
Well, it's not much better, but it's like the new gas station bathroom.

49:05.240 --> 49:06.440
It's a brand new gas station!

49:06.440 --> 49:09.440
The bathroom hasn't quite gotten all disease-ridden yet.

49:09.440 --> 49:11.200
Alright, well, let's move on.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.600
Let's talk about other PlayStation 3.

49:12.600 --> 49:17.160
What could have been, and according to 1UP, apparently what happened, Final Fantasy Elite

49:17.160 --> 49:18.160
11.

49:18.160 --> 49:21.840
Kind of interesting that it came out on the Xbox 360, but it never really came out on

49:21.840 --> 49:22.840
the PlayStation 3.

49:22.840 --> 49:26.880
I mean, true, you could do the PS2 backwards compatibility, but even then, sometimes the

49:26.880 --> 49:30.600
hard drive issues would kind of get in the way, I think, depending on what system you

49:30.600 --> 49:31.600
owned, I think.

49:31.600 --> 49:36.360
But then you could download a patch that would allow you to play it from the PS2 version

49:36.360 --> 49:37.360
on the PS3.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.360
Okay, that's cool.

49:38.360 --> 49:43.560
But at some point, they were going to release, I guess, a nicer version, I guess you could

49:43.560 --> 49:44.560
say, on the PlayStation 3.

49:44.560 --> 49:47.440
Probably one with all the expansions included and what have you.

49:47.440 --> 49:53.640
Well, apparently, it was supposed to happen, but apparently, the Sony representative that

49:53.640 --> 50:01.520
Square was working with, they were working with Hiromichi Tanaka, I guess, was just quit.

50:01.520 --> 50:05.440
And they never really resumed talks, which is kind of strange.

50:05.440 --> 50:09.920
Oh well, Final Fantasy 11 is still getting three new expansions next year, but not through

50:09.920 --> 50:11.240
the traditional retail channels.

50:11.240 --> 50:14.120
They will all be downloadable story expansions.

50:14.120 --> 50:19.520
No new classes, none of that stuff, just story and quest expansions, which is interesting.

50:19.520 --> 50:22.520
I assume zone expansions, too.

50:22.520 --> 50:27.560
So yep, Final Fantasy 11 on the PS3, it was an idea, so if you wondered why it wasn't

50:27.560 --> 50:30.000
there, somebody else must have been thinking of the same thing, but then they just gave

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
up.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Yeah, they didn't care, like some of us.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
I guess.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.640
I'm kind of over Final Fantasy 11.

50:35.640 --> 50:37.840
I know you're in Other Addiction now.

50:37.840 --> 50:42.240
Yeah, I have WoW now, but I would like to revisit Final Fantasy 11 someday when it gets

50:42.240 --> 50:46.200
redone and has a new, like Final Fantasy 11-2.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.200
Why not?

50:47.200 --> 50:48.200
They did 10-2.

50:48.200 --> 50:49.200
Why can't they do 11-2?

50:49.200 --> 50:51.560
Maybe because they have good taste sometimes.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.960
Oh, shush.

50:52.960 --> 50:56.520
Well, here's something that should excite a lot of people.

50:56.520 --> 51:01.000
I know there's a lot of our listeners out there who are fans of Fallout 3.

51:01.000 --> 51:10.580
Well, for the PC, Bethesda actually brought out a PC toolset for Fallout 3 so that you

51:10.580 --> 51:16.680
can, I guess, create your own levels.

51:16.680 --> 51:22.520
You can modify and edit buildings, landscapes, dialogue characters, basically you can just

51:22.520 --> 51:24.800
change it all up into your own game, pretty much.

51:24.800 --> 51:27.200
That's why Logie's not all over this.

51:27.200 --> 51:31.500
It was called the Garden of Eden Creation Kit.

51:31.500 --> 51:35.040
I don't really mod games anymore.

51:35.040 --> 51:38.960
I wait for other people to mod them and then add to it.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.520
You can download it off of the Fallout 3 website.

51:41.520 --> 51:43.520
It's 8.47 megabytes.

51:43.520 --> 51:51.280
I want someone to do the wondrous thing that someone has done with the Half-Life editor

51:51.280 --> 51:55.480
and make me a Hypercube version of Fallout 3.

51:55.480 --> 52:00.320
I would like to see one where the world ended because of something Jamie did.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.320
Mega Maniac Mansion!

52:02.320 --> 52:04.400
Seriously, you totally could.

52:04.400 --> 52:05.880
That would be pretty awesome.

52:05.880 --> 52:11.920
Well, actually, I was going to say, other than all the cool stuff for Half-Life, Grand

52:11.920 --> 52:15.680
Theft Auto IV, they have some of the first mods out there for it.

52:15.680 --> 52:20.800
Of course, the game actually doesn't allow you to run files that are modified, but someone's

52:20.800 --> 52:25.560
found a way around it, like it was cake or something.

52:25.560 --> 52:30.440
And they've made pistols that fire rockets, which are pretty funny, and then also pistols

52:30.440 --> 52:37.680
and machine guns that have really hard kickbacks to them, so you fire it at a car or something

52:37.680 --> 52:43.640
and it actually blows the car back and blows people away like they got hit with a jet or

52:43.640 --> 52:44.640
something.

52:44.640 --> 52:49.160
But it's pretty funny and cool handling mods and stuff like that.

52:49.160 --> 52:53.080
You can set it up drifting and whatnot.

52:53.080 --> 52:58.400
So it's crazy that this game's only been out for a week or so and they've already gotten

52:58.400 --> 53:01.160
mods and a mod system in place.

53:01.160 --> 53:05.280
So can't wait to actually try some of these.

53:05.280 --> 53:08.540
Haven't gone around to actually modding it yet, but that's why I got it.

53:08.540 --> 53:10.840
So fun times.

53:10.840 --> 53:11.840
Alright.

53:11.840 --> 53:22.160
Now, some other cool stuff available for Fallout 3, of course, is some brand new download content,

53:22.160 --> 53:25.240
and that'll be coming soon.

53:25.240 --> 53:30.520
What's kind of neat about the download content, though, is they're going to be raising the

53:30.520 --> 53:36.440
level cap on it, and you'll actually be able to...

53:36.440 --> 53:39.520
I don't know what level they're going to raise it to, but I know right now it's pretty limited.

53:39.520 --> 53:45.160
I think it's like 30 or something, which is kind of cool.

53:45.160 --> 53:51.840
And then, of course, the first screenshots have been released for the new download content

53:51.840 --> 53:56.120
where you get the fight in Alaska, which is kind of cool looking.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.120
Fight in Alaska?

53:57.120 --> 54:01.080
Well, it's going to be like a simulation, I guess, for one of the...

54:01.080 --> 54:06.200
I haven't played the game yet, but some of the backstory stuff for it, which is kind

54:06.200 --> 54:07.360
of neat.

54:07.360 --> 54:10.240
And that should be coming soon.

54:10.240 --> 54:15.240
I think the level cap is actually going to be the third bit of updates that they're going

54:15.240 --> 54:21.360
to have, but they're going to also add, I guess, some more stealth action focused missions.

54:21.360 --> 54:25.320
They're also going to have a Chinese base to get the fight through, and some other exclusive

54:25.320 --> 54:26.320
download content.

54:26.320 --> 54:31.440
But, yeah, the first download content actually should be available soon.

54:31.440 --> 54:34.120
Operation Anchorage is what it's called.

54:34.120 --> 54:36.040
And it's four to five hours long.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.440
It's going to be 800 Microsoft points.

54:38.440 --> 54:43.400
All right, well, shifting gears here a little bit, talking about a different type of quest.

54:43.400 --> 54:46.480
I promised there'd be a story on WoW tonight, and it's not really the type of story you

54:46.480 --> 54:47.480
might be expecting.

54:47.480 --> 54:51.320
It's actually something Game Politics ran, so you know it's going to involve controversy.

54:51.320 --> 54:52.320
Something political.

54:52.320 --> 54:54.160
It has to do with World of Warcraft.

54:54.160 --> 55:00.480
And they are actually relaying news that another website, Boing Boing, reported on this week.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.720
It has to do with Richard Bartell.

55:02.720 --> 55:05.560
He is apparently the guy who invented mud games.

55:05.560 --> 55:10.640
He kind of started the mud genre on the internet, which if you don't know what that is, God,

55:10.640 --> 55:12.000
go read on Wikipedia or something.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.080
Basically mud games kind of really led to things like World of Warcraft.

55:15.080 --> 55:16.640
It was the first kind of online.

55:16.640 --> 55:17.640
It was all text-based.

55:17.640 --> 55:21.640
Like, imagine a text-based game like Zork, make a multiplayer.

55:21.640 --> 55:25.200
Like a lot of hardcore Dungeons and Dragons people, this is what they would do in the

55:25.200 --> 55:26.200
early days of the net.

55:26.200 --> 55:27.880
I played lots of them.

55:27.880 --> 55:28.880
Right.

55:28.880 --> 55:29.880
But here's the thing.

55:29.880 --> 55:31.280
Richard Bartell, he got his feathers ruffled.

55:31.280 --> 55:32.280
He was playing WoW recently.

55:32.280 --> 55:34.820
He was playing the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, and there's apparently a quest

55:34.820 --> 55:35.820
in the game.

55:35.820 --> 55:37.220
And I can tell you, this quest does exist.

55:37.220 --> 55:41.560
There's a quest where you basically torture a prisoner to get information out of him to

55:41.560 --> 55:42.840
move on.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.960
And this is what Richard Bartell said about it.

55:44.960 --> 55:47.840
Basically you have to take some type of cowpoke and zap a prisoner until he talks.

55:47.840 --> 55:49.000
I'm not at all happy with this.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.480
I was expecting for there to be some way to tell the guy who gave you the quest that no,

55:52.480 --> 55:55.360
actually I don't want to torture a prisoner, but there didn't seem to be any way to do

55:55.360 --> 55:56.360
that.

55:56.360 --> 55:59.400
Worse, the quest is part of a chain you need to complete to gain access to the Nexus, which

55:59.400 --> 56:03.080
is the first instance you encounter if you start at the west of the continent as I did.

56:03.080 --> 56:07.560
So either you play along and zap the guy, or you don't get to go to the Nexus.

56:07.560 --> 56:08.700
That's actually not true.

56:08.700 --> 56:10.440
You can go to the Nexus at any time.

56:10.440 --> 56:12.680
If you want the quest there, you do this quest line.

56:12.680 --> 56:14.800
I did zap him pretty well in disbelief.

56:14.800 --> 56:17.920
I thought that surely the quest giver would step in and stop at some point.

56:17.920 --> 56:18.920
It didn't happen, though.

56:18.920 --> 56:22.320
Unless there's some type of awful consequence further down the line, it would seem that

56:22.320 --> 56:26.280
Blizzard's designers are okay with breaking the Geneva Convention.

56:26.280 --> 56:30.480
It's a game!

56:30.480 --> 56:34.520
I'm just kind of a little bit in disbelief, because it's like, well, A, he's completely

56:34.520 --> 56:38.720
misstating the thing about you have to do this quest to enter the Nexus.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.240
That's not true.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.000
You can enter the Nexus whenever.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.280
You know, you can get some in there.

56:43.280 --> 56:46.200
You just don't get the quest line or what have you.

56:46.200 --> 56:51.840
But there's like 50,000 quests now, and I'm obviously overstating that.

56:51.840 --> 56:54.080
There's lots and lots of quests in Wrath of the Lich King.

56:54.080 --> 56:59.480
Trust me, you can level your character to 80 and only play through four of the zones.

56:59.480 --> 57:02.080
And there's like seven or eight zones, so you could skip this all together.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.560
You could start on the east continent or whatever.

57:03.560 --> 57:08.140
But anyway, okay, even if you couldn't skip this and it was a part of the game, I mean,

57:08.140 --> 57:13.160
do you write angry letters every time you watch an episode of 24 and he tortures a prisoner?

57:13.160 --> 57:14.960
Or every time you watch a movie?

57:14.960 --> 57:19.200
Or every time somebody wrote a torture scene in a mud game somewhere on the internet, which

57:19.200 --> 57:21.200
I'm sure exists somewhere?

57:21.200 --> 57:24.140
I mean, hello?

57:24.140 --> 57:26.640
What is it we always say here that you started here, Jay?

57:26.640 --> 57:27.640
What is it?

57:27.640 --> 57:29.640
Learn to be offended.

57:29.640 --> 57:30.640
Yes.

57:30.640 --> 57:31.640
Fucking people.

57:31.640 --> 57:35.280
I mean, it's just a game.

57:35.280 --> 57:40.480
And you know, if you want to, you just go to the quest and you click Abandoned Quest,

57:40.480 --> 57:42.080
and there you don't have to do it.

57:42.080 --> 57:44.200
How hard was that?

57:44.200 --> 57:50.000
Anyway, the kind of ignorance stated here, even if this guy is a big deal for what he

57:50.000 --> 57:53.760
did, it was kind of a silly thing to state here.

57:53.760 --> 58:13.640
So you know, I'm just going to do the angsty F.U. as part of the show right now.

58:13.640 --> 58:15.960
I don't care if this is political.

58:15.960 --> 58:20.960
A big, flaming fuck you to George Bush.

58:20.960 --> 58:29.400
For all of the series of legislation he's just passed during his last blessed day, the

58:29.400 --> 58:36.040
end of his stupid reign in the White House, I mean, he's basically passed a bunch of executive

58:36.040 --> 58:43.560
orders that are going to pretty much be creating some lasting damage, not just to our economy,

58:43.560 --> 58:52.200
but to the several ecosystems by promoting waste dumping, by allowing mining very close

58:52.200 --> 58:59.040
to national parks, in fact, I think one of them was near Yellowstone, if I'm correct.

58:59.040 --> 59:07.460
Also for passing a law that pretty much lets any doctor not perform any kind of procedure

59:07.460 --> 59:15.880
based on moral, personal ethics, not necessarily the overall ethics of the community that they

59:15.880 --> 59:16.880
represent.

59:16.880 --> 59:22.600
And it's really disgusting, a lot of it is, as far as I can tell, unconstitutional, and

59:22.600 --> 59:29.200
I'm sure quite a bit of it can be overturned under congressional review, which is the one

59:29.200 --> 59:35.960
good thing that Newt Gingrich ever did, apart from being hilarious on TV.

59:35.960 --> 59:42.560
But it's very disgusting, I encourage everyone to study up on it, and definitely write your

59:42.560 --> 59:48.400
congressman and let them know that, you know, you're disgusted too, I'm already preparing

59:48.400 --> 59:49.400
several letters.

59:49.400 --> 59:55.400
I mean, because, I'm sorry, our new president has enough shit to deal with right now without

59:55.400 --> 01:00:03.840
having more shit thrown on top of it, so I have faith that he can clear through the muck,

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.880
but still, it's disgusting.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.280
In fact, I'm so infuriated by it that it makes me feel sick to my stomach, so.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.280
Alright.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.280
Loki.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:23.880
Um, I was gonna say F U 2, take 2 for putting out a crappy version, well, I should say a

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:29.960
buggy version of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, the fact that I've gotta still wait for

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:38.480
patches before they, you know, support something that most modern games support now is ridiculous,

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:44.760
and I don't know, I just hate having to wait before a game to work correctly, you know,

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.520
I, if I'm spending the money to, you know, buy the game, why does it have to be, you

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:53.480
know, weeks later that I get a game that actually works?

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.960
Is that it?

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.960
Alright.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.640
Um, my F U of the Week goes to potstickers, because they're really addicting, like, I

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.920
had, um, I just can't stop eating potstickers, like, it's like, the food I've been craving,

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.120
like anytime I go out to a restaurant that might have them, I have to get potstickers

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.320
because they're so friggin addicting, and I never had this, like I feel like I'm pregnant

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.040
or something and craving things I don't usually crave before, and that food is potstickers.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.560
I know, it's so random, but that's what it is.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.560
So F U.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.560
You're growing a gas baby.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560
Apparently.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.640
So F U to potstickers for being so non-malicious.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.760
There you have it.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.640
And I've learned, you can get potstickers lots of different places, it's pretty surprising,

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.640
and I've probably sampled them everywhere.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.360
Anyway, hey, let's move back into some gaming news, let's try to get this show actually

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.640
back on the track of gaming, with our next story.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.640
We gotta.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.640
Yeah, of course.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.640
Okay.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.200
Well, um, I'm sure we have a number of, uh, our listeners who are big Dragon Quest fans,

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.480
and the, uh, next installation, Dragon Quest X, is going to be on Wii.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.920
Um, well, basically the next one is technically 9, isn't it?

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.200
But they've confirmed that X is going to be on Wii.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.880
And that's pretty cool.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:15.240
It's also going to be, as far as I'm aware, the first of the Dragon Quest games on the

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.600
Wii, so that's pretty cool.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:23.200
And, um, the Japanese release date, by the way, for Dragon Quest IX is going to be March

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.320
28th.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.600
So it's going to be, uh, 5980 yen.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.200
Yay.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.640
Cool.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:39.360
Um, some other cool stuff that will be, uh, well, I don't know if we're getting this around

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:47.000
here, but, um, Scrabble apparently has been released on the DS in, um, the UK.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.280
And, um, I think we actually had a story about something similar a while back, um, with the

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.760
word spaz and how people kind of spazzed out about it.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:04.080
Um, well, now, apparently, a used copy of the game Scrabble, which apparently learns

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:12.760
words based on, you know, stuff that you add in there, um, Scrabble, this, uh, kid actually

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:19.960
was playing it, and apparently Scrabble beat him on a triple word score with the word fuckers.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:27.120
And, apparently, um, the mother of, you know, that's what I call my DS when it beats me

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120
at a game.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120
Fucker!

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:36.520
The mother, I guess, um, apparently, uh, Tanya, um, she had bought this game for her son Ethan,

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.680
and it was a pre-owned copy, I guess, of Ubisoft Scrabble, which I didn't realize, I don't

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:45.920
think they have it over here, I wish they did, because Scrabble's awesome, um, but what's

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.440
funny, though, is it kept, um, you know, using different slang words, like, you know, tits

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:59.440
to toke to fuckers, uh, and, I guess, gave Ethan poor self-esteem or something, I don't

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.440
know.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.240
Here's what I want to know, was the mom watching him play the DS over his shoulder?

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.240
I don't know.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.400
How else did she find out about it?

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.880
Did he go crying to mommy, mommy, mommy, the game says fuck!

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.340
Maybe he, maybe, you know, because, you know, Scrabble saw all the words on the board, maybe

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.040
he saw the word fuckers on there, and she looked at it, and she's like, what the hell,

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.280
wait, what the hell's tits on there?

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.820
What the fuck is fuckers doing on there?

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:31.120
So apparently, you know, this, you know, is coming from, I guess, um, you know, what she

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:35.160
should have done is simply challenge the word, because I don't think you'd be able to find

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.800
it in the official Scrabble dictionary.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:43.080
Well apparently, apparently, uh, this is coming from Tabloid Daily Mail, you know, they're

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.760
hosts of a bunch of useless articles.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.760
So reliable?

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.760
Yes.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.000
Um, Ubisoft is saying that she should have used the game's junior settings, because I

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.800
guess fuckers isn't in the junior version of Scrabble, and Nintendo, of course, doesn't

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800
want anything to do.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.800
That's where it'll just use, you know, Lil' Fucker.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:10.720
I mean, really, this is news, really.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720
It's just funny.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.720
She's really ugly, too.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.720
She looks like she got beat with the ugly stick a bunch of times.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:21.160
It's just J100Matt in chat says, uh, why do these fucking kids need to tell their parents

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.720
that their games are cursing at them?

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720
I would laugh.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720
I would think that's awesome.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.220
I would show it to my friends.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.860
That's what you're supposed to do.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.860
With naughty language.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.860
Look at my boy, dude!

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:40.920
You know, instead of Lil' Ethan going, Mommy, Mommy, my game swore at me, I'm telling, you

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920
know.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.360
Lil' punk kid.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.280
I think there's actually a version of Scrabble.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.720
And you want to know, you know, she's totally grooming him to be a little wuss anyways,

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.760
you know, him and his pink DS.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.720
Hey, wait a minute.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.600
You know, here, you know, there's some type of Scrabble.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.160
You know how like every board game has their own house rules?

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.380
Like in Monopoly, you might have a house rule where all the tax money goes into a free parking

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.960
jackpot for when you land on free parking, right?

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:16.600
Well, I think there's some house rules for Scrabble where dirty words automatically are

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.120
triple word score.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.520
So like it encourages people to use bad words.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.640
Yes, we do that all the time.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.640
Absolutely.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.580
We even played Ebonics Scrabble one time.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.280
That was God.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.720
Wow.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.200
Wow.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:37.080
If it sounded like a word, it was a word.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.080
I'd like to play that sometime.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:42.200
That would be fun.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:48.600
Anyhow, one game I was mad when they discontinued many years ago and made me yell, fuckers,

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.760
was when they got rid of the great Gianna Sisters.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.680
1987 was the year that this game was originally released, and it was pretty awesome.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:01.200
It was on the Commodore 64, but the problem was it looked and felt just like Mario.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.760
Although if you actually played it, there was like a lot of differences.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.920
Like for instance, hello in the great Gianna Sisters, you actually fight a giant enemy

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.240
crab at the end of like the second level.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.000
I know this predates even the PlayStation 3, but unfortunately, at least the very first

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.200
level like seriously looked exactly like Mario World 1-1.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.000
So you know, the similarities were shown in this game ended up having to get pulled off

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
the market.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.080
It was also not just big on the 64, I believe it was a big Amiga game for what I know, but

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.680
the soundtrack was amazing.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:35.000
Well, anyhow, the game was, you know, taken off shelves and it kind of lived on throughout

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.680
the homebrew community and people, you know, looking for abandonware on the internet and

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.840
what have you.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:46.760
Apparently, one of the creators of the game, the programmer, Armin Gessert, he is now working

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:52.440
on an official DS version with his new studio, Spellbound, and it's apparently going to be

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.480
coming out in June.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.080
It's going to have over 80 levels and apparently the DS microphone is going to play into the

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.320
game somehow and they'll actually use the touch screen and everything.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:07.720
Now one of the great things about the original game was the soundtrack and the new version,

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:13.440
Chris Hilsbeck, is coming back to do remixed versions of the original soundtrack.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.000
So that's pretty awesome.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.240
And this is one of those games where, you know, if you've never played this game, maybe

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.520
some week we'll highlight it as a classic game of the week down the road, but it's one

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.700
of those games you definitely should check out.

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:30.760
I'm sure there's clips on YouTube of the game and just, you know, you can see it's similarities

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.760
to Mario Brothers.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:36.780
But it was kind of neat, it was a fun game, especially for that era, you know, it doesn't

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:40.440
really hold up against today's games, which is why I'm interested to see kind of what

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:45.640
they do to it on the DS version, how they're going to kind of make it unique.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.000
But based on the screenshots, it looks a lot different.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.680
It definitely doesn't look like Mario anymore, that's for sure.

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.780
So we'll see.

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:55.280
Let's move on.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.440
Well, moving forward, it looks like we've actually got some release dates.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.600
How does that sound?

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.600
Release dates!

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.280
Well, it is December, so what else can we expect?

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.000
Let me go ahead and take a look.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
For the UK?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.240
Exactly, for the UK.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:20.760
Actually, it's Crash Commando and Sonic Unleashed.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.480
That's really it.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:26.480
I was going to be a little bit more excited, but I guess not.

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.440
I can't say things are much better in the US, though.

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.120
There are a few things coming out, so it's not that bad, but it's certainly not, you

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.540
know, in November or anything like that.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:41.240
This week, though, some of the highlights, Rise of the Argonauts will be coming out on

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:45.960
all systems, well, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:54.480
Also this week, we've got the release of some DS games, Kate West's The Vanishing Files.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:03.080
We've also got Mystery PI, Portrait of a Thief, and Dreamer Horse Training, because god damn

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.120
it, there's not enough horse training games.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.080
And Puppy Training, which has a really cute cover, that's awesome.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:16.040
Slingo Quest, also coming out from DS, it's a mumbo jumbo casual game.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:22.520
And Neopets Puzzle Adventure, ripping off Puzzle Quest there.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:28.920
And let's see, lots of crappy DS games this week, man, I swear.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:35.120
Australia Zoo Quest, which is a puzzle game and for some reason has Cyberwin on the cover.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.200
Yeah, it's crikey indeed.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:43.800
Learn Math for grades 1 through 4, a math learning game.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:48.960
Driver's Ed Portable on DS, yes, you can learn how to drive.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:55.080
And other things other than DS games, there's a few Destiny or Wii games.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:59.040
Summer Sports 2, Island Sports Party, you know, they're a party game.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.640
And We're Jeong Party, it's a mah-jeong party game, interesting.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:15.280
And Rock Band 2 on the Wii, the game only version will be coming out on the 18th.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:24.800
And I just gotta mention this, on the 19th, Calvin Tucker's Redneck Jamboree on the Wii.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.800
That's it.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.880
Well, you know, if you want a busy week for game releases, you need to look at Japan,

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.800
because there's tons of stuff coming out in Japan this week.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.720
Now granted, a lot of it is localized versions of stuff we've already had here in the US,

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.440
but let me talk about what's coming out in Japan.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.320
Starting with 360, we have just that, a big release for Japan would be Fable 2, the localized

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.560
version is coming out this week, December 18th.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.080
Lego Batman, Need for Speed Undercover, and Prince of Persia, also all being released

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.480
on the 360 in Japan this week.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.840
Also a game local for Japan, Gundam Musou 2 comes out in Japan.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:03.480
And this game is a shooter that looks to be probably based on Gundam, yep, robots with

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480
guns.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.520
Stacey Warriors Gundam 2, there you go.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.040
That game is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.520
Moving on to the Playstation 3, many of those same titles, there's also Gundam Musou 2 comes

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.040
out there as well.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:20.000
Lego Batman, Medal of Honor gets a price drop, as does the Godfather and Armored Core.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.840
That's what you've got to look forward to on the Playstation 3, although I do want to

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.400
point out there's also a wireless keypad available now in Japan, if you want to check that out.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:33.600
Hey, on the Wii, they have a game called Let's Tap is coming out from Sega in Japan.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.120
Remember that's the one where it's the game that penguins can play.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.920
Oh, that's right, a game that even penguins can play.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.160
You set the Wiimote on the box and you tap the box.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.360
You don't actually use the controller at all.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.360
Oh, yes, yes, okay.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.280
Kind of looks interesting, there's all these little visualizers and things.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.280
I wonder if, they'll probably be, they're bringing that over here, right?

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.320
Could be interesting.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.280
Bleach vs. Crusade also coming out on the Wii this week, because you know, you love

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.280
Bleach.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.520
So there you go.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.680
Dance Dance Revolution Furu Furu Party comes out this week in Japan as well, and that would

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.640
obviously be our version of Dancing Party.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.960
And Elibits gets a price reduction this week, hooray.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:20.360
Also going on the Playstation 2, a little game called Beatmania 2DX gets its 15th game

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.520
in the series on Playstation 2 this week.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.460
DJ Troopers comes out on December 18th.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:29.640
Not the 15th game on the Playstation, however, because they didn't start with 1st.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.640
They started on 3rd style.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.680
But this would be the 12th game on the Playstation 2 in the 2DX series.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:39.360
In Japan only, that's not even counting the one we got in the US.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.160
Fate Unlimited Codes is also coming out on the Playstation 2 as well as another version

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:51.960
of Gondamuso 2 for the Playstation 2, and Pachinko series volume 13, Neon Genesis Evangelion.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:52.960
Yet another one.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.960
Lord.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.800
Why can't they let that series die?

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.360
They just can't.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.440
On the DS, lots and lots and lots of games getting released on the DS over there as well

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.040
as some other, let me just kind of give you some of the names of things coming out.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.960
Tales of Hearts is one that's coming out, as well as Space Puzzle Bobble.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.320
Ragnarok Online DS comes out this week.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.160
Jamie Alistin, Ragnarok Online on the DS, finally, this week in Japan, there you have

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160
it.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.320
And Jamie, you might be interested in this one too.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.480
Princess Ballerina, Yumei Miru 4 Gen no Primadonna.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.920
Don't you like primadonnas?

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.320
No, but I'm watching Bush get a shoe thrown at him and that's pretty fucking funny.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320
Stop it.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.880
Lego Batman also comes out.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.160
Rensu Suikoden Tear Crease comes out, that would be the Suikoden's strategic title.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.600
So it's a busy week in DS World and as far as the PSP goes, all the other systems are

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.440
getting love, why not the PSP?

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.440
And yes, Final Fantasy Dissida finally makes its way out of the PSP this week, I'm sure

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.760
you'll be hearing a lot about that.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:02.360
Also I do want to point this out, Crimson Room Rebirth also comes out and some movies

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:09.720
for the localized for Japan, Biohazard Degeneration, what would that be?

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.960
And then Star Wars The Clone Wars also comes out this week in Japan.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:18.440
Need for Speed Undercover, Samurai Showdown Anthology, Ultimate Board Game Collection,

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.520
all on the PSP, very busy week in Japan for releases.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.320
So there you go.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:30.280
Let's move on with more news and then we're going to take a quick break here.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:38.600
While there is a little bit more, this actually has to do with some, excuse me, with something

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.520
having to do with Rockstar.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.880
There's going to be, well actually I think it already happened, there was a social club

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:51.500
event put out by Rockstar for Midnight Club Los Angeles and Grand Theft Auto IV that was

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.600
going on Xbox Live and Playstation Network.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:05.280
They were supposed to have a little contest, as in a video editor contest for GTA IV PC

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:10.680
and then for topping the Midnight Club Ocean to LA time trial.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.800
And there were supposed to be prizes available for both.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:23.520
It was though already going on and I do believe it was from five to nine UK time actually

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.880
I think today, so already going.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.960
Good luck to whoever won.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:35.080
That's pretty cool.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:40.860
Some other fun stuff, Prototype.

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:46.080
You may remember this game being kind of like an open world, crack down meets, you know,

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.680
kind of mutants type of thing.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:55.960
What's interesting though is, earlier this week, a bunch of different blogs and stuff

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.680
were reporting that Activision's Prototype website is actually broken and some of the

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:07.480
assets from apparently CES were leaking out onto the web.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.720
And there was all sorts of different gameplay videos and stuff like that, you know, that

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:17.440
was supposed to be stuff that they were showing off at CES and then, you know, a few, I guess

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:26.640
a day later or so, the hole was covered back up and the countdown back to CES was put back

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.880
on the website.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:35.360
Well, the funny thing is about all that, that's what they want you to think, you see.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:40.760
The whole leak was a hoax, actually.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:41.760
Perpetrated...

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.120
Do people know that?

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.120
No.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.120
Perpetrated by...

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:48.800
So wait, you're saying the game blogs all got punk this week?

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.480
Yes, they all got punk this week.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.480
Perpetrated by their marketing team.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.480
And how do you know this?

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.480
You're making this up.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.480
You make this shit up.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.400
No, I don't make this shit up.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.300
I know this because they sent out an email boasting about it.

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.840
So it's all a ruse...

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840
To who?

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.840
To you?

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.600
Why would Activision send you an email boasting about it?

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:16.760
They send it to all of their retail partners to let their customers know because they're

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:22.920
trying to drive up buzz for prototyping because everybody loves leaked assets and so they're

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.220
going to start talking about it.

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:29.100
If it was just a release of assets, it might not have been getting as much attention.

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:33.060
But since it was something forbidden, people are interested in it.

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.060
And it worked.

01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:40.440
It got them all to cover this leak and got all the information out there and the videos

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:45.720
were ranked pretty high in game trailers and that's all good buzz for them.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.520
People want to see things they're not supposed to be seeing.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.520
Exactly.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.520
But it was a hoax the whole time.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.960
The whole time it was a hoax.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:59.280
They made it look like it was an FTP directory and everything and they got you all.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.140
And people don't know this yet.

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:02.800
You're the one telling them.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:03.800
People don't know it.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.180
It doesn't really matter because the game looks awesome.

01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:12.640
The whole thing is they're tricking the people that they normally work with in the media

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.400
to cover their game.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.840
Surely these people are going to find out eventually if they haven't already.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.840
Do you think there's going to be retaliation?

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.840
No.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.480
I think this stuff happens all the time to be honest.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.480
Okay.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.480
Here's another thing though.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:29.600
Could they be saying now that, oh yeah, we meant for that to happen when maybe they didn't?

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.600
No.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.600
It was in great detail.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:40.240
In fact, you know who tipped them off that the site had been broken?

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.080
The people that orchestrated the whole thing.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.960
They're the ones that tipped off the media.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.280
Interesting.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:56.720
But just goes to show you, sometimes you may see these leaks via, I don't know, survey

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.960
sites and stuff like that, and you may think, hey, why aren't these publishers doing anything

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.320
to stop these leaks?

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:11.580
Sometimes they're intentional, and sometimes that's how they drive buzz for stuff.

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:16.760
Just a little bit of insight in the back workings of the game publishing world.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.540
I'm kind of not surprised by what you're telling me, but there is that very skeptical part

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:24.940
of me that's like, oh well sure, they didn't know about it when it happened, but now it's

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:25.940
...

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.720
It was in great detail.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:33.880
I wish I had forwarded the email to myself so I could read it.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.380
It's funny.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.120
It's not that important.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:42.320
It's just funny.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.040
But the game itself looks pretty cool, I guess.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.280
Yeah, the game looks awesome.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.800
It's going to be a really fun game.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.000
It's definitely going to be something I pick up because it's like crack down.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.480
Come on.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.000
I'm feeling something I'll be playing.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
All right.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.920
Well, moving on, before we take a break here on the show, that was a pretty big bombshell.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.720
We should probably have said that earlier in the show.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.720
Yeah, whatever.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:05.720
It's not that big of a deal.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:10.240
A little reward to those who actually pay attention to the whole thing, I guess.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.240
Also a reward for being persistent and working at things.

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:19.400
Not really gaming news, but kind of a gaming funny, I guess you could say.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:24.840
At Missouri State, there was a guy who used his wireless controller to find his stolen

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:25.840
360.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.840
Here's the weird thing.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.040
His Xbox 360 got stolen.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.520
He lived in a college dorm.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.960
He noticed that he could still power on his controller because they didn't take the controllers

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.960
because they were wireless.

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:38.480
He could still power on his controller, and the controller was connecting to the 360.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.320
So knowing that, he realized it's in the next room.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:45.140
No, well, not necessarily, but he knew it was 30 feet away.

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:49.440
So through the process of elimination, what he did, he actually went to the fourth, fifth,

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.960
and sixth floors and found that the controller still worked on the fourth floor, fifth floor,

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.380
and sixth floor, but it would not work on the third or seventh floor.

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.680
So process of elimination, where was the Xbox?

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.480
On the fifth floor, in the middle one, right?

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.960
So then he went to the fifth floor.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.920
If you get too far from the Xbox, the thing will start blinking.

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:10.480
So using the process of elimination, he found out where the center was.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.480
In hot and cold?

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.480
Basically, yeah.

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.740
hot and cold with his controller and it told him exactly where the stolen Xbox

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:20.940
was and they actually got the RA, the resident assistant, to go into the room

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:25.680
and where the stolen Xbox supposedly was they found the Xbox and apparently what's

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:31.840
really funny about it is that the thief wasn't around when they got it so

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:39.560
they know who lives there yeah interesting interesting people actually

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:43.360
do have a brain in college people are retarded the old some people are brain

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.480
in college some people who stole it obviously doesn't have a brain they'll

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:52.560
be going home seriously I don't know I'd be pressing charges but that would be me

01:22:52.560 --> 01:23:01.080
because you know I totally don't care so kinda um that's a stupid award in a way

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:05.200
I probably stole it well but the thing is I I more give props to the guy who

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:08.400
used the investigative skills to figure it out you know what I mean that's like

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.640
the guy who stole it is I versus spy yes I guess you'd say it's kind of both at

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.960
once a good job is it it's kind of like you're that what it would it go good job

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.480
gumshoe remember Carmen San Diego yeah so he's the gumshoe of the week award

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.560
did I almost actually bought that game on PC what we're in the world's Carmen

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.440
San Diego yeah it was awesome I found it thrift store is that one of those games

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.360
you can do a game tap I'm pretty sure it is I don't have game to build school

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:41.560
once I have ZSNES and magic engine and actually have the systems to look we're

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:45.640
gonna get into the classic game of the week is a part of the show we like to do

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:49.760
here every week where dark soccer will take a game from years past and

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:55.320
highlighted here on the show because you should respect your elders in games and

01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:04.520
you're just so excited you just throw in your microphone oh yes the classic

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:09.320
video game of the week of the classic game of the week is willow for the

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.960
Nintendo Entertainment System you know what's hilarious I was just thinking

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:16.920
about this game today I shit you not and I was actually thinking like this game

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.040
needs to be highlighted as a classic game of the week and I swear to God

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.520
before I read that you were picking up for tonight amazing

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:27.200
well you have to skip about a minute 25 minute music because it has the music I

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:33.320
like which is the actual kicking-ass outside the village music

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.360
it's like some of the best video game music ever you know what other game is

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:54.280
awesome that's also based off a movie Adams family that's just quest was shit

01:24:54.280 --> 01:25:02.520
it's pretty cool so well I own back to willow the game came out in 1989 it

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:08.400
actually came out for the Famicom first in 1988 sorry it actually came out 1989

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.840
on both systems but the movie came out in 88 so basically you play as willow

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:22.840
and you go by yourself and it's kind of Zelda ish but not really it's more like

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:28.600
um kind of playing like Secret of Mana did actually but being a Nintendo an NES

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:33.480
game but it was put out by Capcom this is one of the cool things that Capcom

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:39.160
has given us why don't we have willow in a Capcom game huh there are also other

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:43.960
I'm thinking licensing for the movie I'm joking right there are also other games

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:50.400
there was a computer game that came out on amiga Atari st and a DOS game that

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:57.160
came out by a midnight entertainment group but it wasn't the same game it was

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.600
a different one so anyone who's thinking they've got it you're wrong I was gonna

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:04.120
say I'm surprised I'd never played that that's cool though there's also an

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:10.680
arcade version but it was action adventure and again is not like this one

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:16.480
this one is a is a action RPG is pretty cool little game and you could get you

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.740
know basically your items and weapons and meet people from the game and go talk

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:25.840
to stuff as RPG but it was willow and it was pretty cool plus you know it had

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:34.880
acorns that turn people into stone I love this game

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:38.440
all right there it is your classic game of the week willow on the Nintendo

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:42.480
Entertainment System and there's a complete walkthrough there on YouTube

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:45.440
that we were kind of playing the music from there you can just watch somebody

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.200
blast through the game they use cheat codes to do it but you still get a

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.520
pretty good feel for what the game looks like there so I love that game I played

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:55.680
the crap I did too that was one of those games I rented and that we held on to it

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.960
for like so long because I didn't want to take it back

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:02.560
you ended up having to pay for it yeah well not not you know just a pretty you

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:08.120
know like probably like $12 which is the time was a lot for a rental so there you

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:11.240
go but willow was awesome all right we're gonna take a break here on orange

full experience of the show and being able to interact with the chat room and

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.640

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.520
love you guys listen on the podcast as well we got plenty more news for you

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:56.960
guys this segment and we'll start off with Loki who just finished watching the

01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.720
Spike TV Awards through the matches of the internet right just last even though

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.200
we don't really give a crap about the VGA's well do we find that do we ever

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.960
find out if people actually vote on this or if it's just you know experts it may

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.840
be experts but game of the year went to Grand Theft Auto 4 which yeah I mean

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.440
there's so many games that come out hard to like rate one I play Grand Theft Auto

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:23.160
4 a lot so yeah sure it's I guess my game of the year but um you know the

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:26.960
best part about that is I guess we'll see a version of Grand Theft Auto 4

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:30.000
come out you know because they always do the game of the year editions so

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.560
there'll be one with the lost in the dam download content probably for the 360

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:40.680
sometime maybe in the fall I don't know spring summer but you know they always

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.120
did the game of the year edition the chat says it's experts that vote on it

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.160
not the experts yet people that work for blogs and stuff actually I think there

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:52.280
were people like I know there's someone from joystick that was on the voting

01:28:52.280 --> 01:29:01.400
community and stuff like that so experts yeah ok sorry let's get into some real

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:06.400
news now lucky alright well apparently a woman from Colorado think she has an

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:13.600
expert opinion of Nintendo's neglect to provide adequate supports for

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:22.000
we remotes yes there is another class-action lawsuit frivolous for well

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:30.280
she doesn't think so for Nintendo's lack of adequate straps for their we remotes

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:37.240
she claims that even though the new straps are thicker and they are the

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:41.600
third purse our third version with a new plastic strap they still fail to secure

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:49.080
the we remote to the user during strenuous use furthermore the suit

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:54.140
alleges that Nintendo has failed to report a single remote strap issue to

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:58.460
the Consumer Product Safety Commission in their monthly reports despite

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:04.440
Nintendo support documents prove the existence of said issues you know what

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.760
lady then you don't get to play the Wii you have your right taken away if you

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.360
can't control you know a simple little thing in your head you don't get to play

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:18.080
it I'm sorry but yeah I do agree with our sacred is extremely frivolous I mean

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:23.640
for one the straps are basically there so that you don't drop the remote on the

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:29.080
ground furthermore then they went to you reinforce them because idiots don't

01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:33.460
realize that they are just meant to prevent you from dropping them on the

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:37.760
ground and so they even reinforce them enough to where you know if you let go

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:43.580
accidentally it probably won't break but it's no guarantee I mean it's just do

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:48.160
they need to put a sticker on the remote that says please touch me gently they

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:53.800
have a warning in front of me with every single game ok they have a warning that

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:58.760
says do not let go of the remote make sure the rip the wrist strap is secure

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:04.760
they even have a stupid condoms on there you make sure that you know people if

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:08.640
they do throw me it's gonna you know it's a rubbery support how much more do

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:14.880
you want them to reinforce these things so that it is still good throw it you

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:18.880
know I mean seriously and you know that's simply just a case of consumer

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:26.400
stupidity someone needs to just duct tape her into someone seller will a

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.680
judge throw this out yes or no judge order to be locked up in a cellar by

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:37.240
duct tape duct tape is great for everything you know duct tape will

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:41.040
silence the stupid masses alright you know what else is great is Circuit City

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.040
you know I'm not talking about the actual store for the prices but the fact

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:48.040
that they spoil things which is pretty awesome on the Circuit City apparently

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:51.800
has a spilled some beans about some upcoming releases including Fire Emblem

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:56.240
Shadow Dragon it's coming out in North America on February 23rd this is if I

01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:59.720
guess the Circuit City computer system is to believe I'm not sure exactly where

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:05.400
this is coming from their website or something but yeah pretty cool huh yeah

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:11.000
it's pretty cool also should point this out even bigger for UDS people Pokemon

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.240
Platinum you still in the collective all Pokemon Platinum March 22nd and Circuit

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:22.440
City had it listed but then they pulled it if that doesn't confirm it I don't

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:29.520
know what does shadow or Fire Emblem that date is close if not accurate

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:35.120
interesting but not that you know anything I know anything that you would

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.840
ever repeated on the show now there have been a few things that move though so

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:46.120
like some of those play for Wii games and stuff coming out later but I have a

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:50.560
feeling though the reason why a lot of these have been pushed and stuff is

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:54.240
they're gonna make a big announcement maybe at CES or something that you're

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:57.920
gonna announce some more games and stuff maybe a little bit on the we see us is

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.800
not a gaming show I don't know why people think these huge announcements

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.960
are gonna come out at CES well they're gonna announce them at some point I mean

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:07.800
it's only a few months off so I would think CES being the next show this

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:12.520
sort of can do their own thing they can say we got Reggie coming to a party me

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:16.160
and moto in the house and the press will show up but here's the thing though Rob

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:22.480
is I think that they would do something at CES because the DSI then you know the

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:29.120
DSI coming out next year at some point I mean that's a technology thing and fair

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:35.320
enough because they may all into that I don't know that's just a guess all right

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.200
I suppose that's an educated guess I would say it's like a seventh grade

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:43.160
level educated guess no I'm kidding but all right we'll see what happens you

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.640
might be right I've always kind of wanted to go to consumer electronic show

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:50.680
just for the laughs and giggles but I won't be able to go this year that's for

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.640
sure I do know that there are going to be gaming people there I mean there's

01:33:53.640 --> 01:34:00.400
like I got a you know obviously I'm not going to see yes but I got an invite you

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.880
know for anybody that you know game retailers are our customers or whatever

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:08.800
if they were going to see yes that they can go sit through a Microsoft

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.040
presentation they're gonna show them the upcoming stuff that they've got coming

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:17.720
out for next year like you know probably just halo wars at that point but you

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:24.400
know stuff like that so there will be some presence it's getting bigger yes

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:27.800
well it's not that far off so we will see soon if they're gonna announce these

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:34.120
officially or not yeah let's move on well something that is actually an

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:39.360
official is that there's going to be former members of Team Ninja and those

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:44.040
who worked on brawl doing a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighter I'm going

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:52.400
to be on the Wii and it's supposed to be a 2.5 D fighter and it's supposed to be

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:58.880
out late 2009 and it's a to quote it's supposed to feature online play to

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:05.360
outperform brawl so I'm hoping that they can pull it off I mean that would be

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:13.160
really cool I actually did like the old to the TMNT tournament fighters that was

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:17.480
kind of a fun game so hopefully this will have actually I hope it has some of

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:25.360
the the characters from that series I think would be fun definitely I mean the

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:29.120
fact that they're saying that they're going to try to outdo Smash Brothers is

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:34.440
kind of a pretty big boasting argument there but I don't know we'll see that's

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:40.960
really high bar I guess to me something else is going to say is coming from

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.400
check is too good Leo Shannon chat says Team Ninja equals April with breast

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:49.200
physics there you go very nice

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:58.320
let's see Halo Wars has been announced to be coming out now on March 3rd and

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:02.760
kind of interesting there's a lot of stuff coming out right there in March

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:08.280
especially since I think a week before that you have killed zone 2 on the ps3

01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:17.240
now of course Halo Wars is the RTS kind of prequel to the whole Halo series and

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:23.200
they've got lots of interesting stuff in there including I think you will play

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.840
as the flood the Covenant and also course you know the Spartans and stuff

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:34.360
like that so that's pretty cool and I guess the game will be also coming out

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:43.500
on February 26 in Japan so that's actually one that Japan's getting it a

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:51.220
few days before us kind of interesting and apparently coming out in Africa

01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:59.720
Europe in the Middle East the day after so almost a worldwide release there be

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.680
interesting to see how that is cuz I know it's probably not gonna do as well

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.440
like a normal Halo game cuz it's a me I'm not a first-person shooter but it

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:11.320
has a low name on it it does have a new name on it and there are a lot RTS fans

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:17.920
out there so you know they're hoping to kind of be like a Starcraft but it's

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:23.960
tough well here's something I'm hoping for and you know take this all the grain

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:27.680
of salt because these are news items quote-unquote news coming from the

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:30.000
latest issue of electronic gaming monthly which I don't know if you heard

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
but they might not be around much more which kind of sad when you consider that

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.440
magazine's been around a long long time but magazine take this all the grain of

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:41.360
salt apparently I think it's probably all coming from quarter man or what have

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:46.560
you yeah here's the thing apparently a sequel to rez is coming out from Tetsuya

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.920
Mizuguchi now here's the thing it's not a real sequel to rez because apparently

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:57.480
Sega owns the IP but he's gonna be making a you know rez-like game now

01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.840
they're quick to point out that it could be related to this QJ game that's

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:03.680
supposed to come out for the Wii but it could be two different things going on

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:07.040
altogether which in my mind it probably is because I think QJ was previously

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.120
said it was gonna be a puzzler rez is definitely not a puzzler rez is an

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:15.120
awesome fucking rail shooter game so but it's nice to know especially because of

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.880
that I guess it did pretty well on Xbox Live it's nice to hear there's interest

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.960
there again I just hope whatever this is doesn't come out on Wii that it is

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.800
another HD game that makes sense

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:31.960
yeah also kind of some other things going on apparently whatever mystery

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:36.600
project LMNO that was going on at EA apparently that is now on ice right now

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.360
I should say like gone forever but just on hold because of all the layoffs that

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.440
were going on is the other Spielberg game yeah yes yes there was he worked on

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.960
boom blocks so this is the other one he was doing apparently it is now on hold

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:52.880
and maybe it could that be related to the questionable sales of boom blocks a

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.720
new rifts game in 2010 as well in Gears of War 3 also in 2010 which really isn't

01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:59.520
a big surprise at all

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:02.480
there's gonna be another Gears of War game they'll probably be Gears of War 4 at some

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:07.040
point too just like they'll be a Halo 4 someday well I mean heck what do you

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:10.760
call this halo 3 dark or no that has a new name now that the other random

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:17.680
numbers and letters whatever that is just halo 4 right there you have it some

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:23.880
rumors out of electronic gaming monthly take with grain of salt we have a little

01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:32.440
bit more rumor more like a hint is that there could quite possibly be halo 2

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:42.440
halo 2 available as a full digital download so that's pretty interesting is

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:51.920
basically when asked if if there would be the the quote is I can't say anything

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:57.280
else on it I would be killed to death so I think it's pretty interesting

01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:04.280
yeah it's interesting because that would be the first like at least on the place

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.600
on the Xbox 360 sorry the ps3 already did this with them the burnout game but

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:15.200
on the 360 where you would have like a full you know $50 game $60 game which

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.340
maybe would come down in price by the time they digitally distribute but you

01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:22.400
know a full price game for download you're starting to see this slowly

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:26.760
happen with other games to like a wrath of the Lich King is available now as a

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.940
digital download burnout obviously you start to see this more and more and you

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:36.440
know game spot swears they're not worried I'm sorry game stop where's

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.160
they're not worried now I wouldn't be there because it's the same with movies

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:44.760
I mean movies there's more of that now we can actually purchase stuff and rent

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:51.840
stuff online digital download but it's definitely not taken away too much from

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:58.240
you know buying you know games I mean look at if anything you look at the

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:02.200
special editions and special edition sales I mean people love their special

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:05.320
editions and they keep getting more creative and putting more crap in there

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.360
well in the case of fable 2 maybe not so much should be start taking stuff out

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:13.280
but for everything else though I mean they're still getting people to buy

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:18.200
these special editions for you know a lot of money I mean look at the

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:22.600
legendary edition stuff of halo 3 and stuff which by the way I saw it fries

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:26.520
this weekend for 59 I know you have a lot of those and yeah they weren't

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:37.800
selling as hot as people thought yeah but yeah I mean it's definitely gonna

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.880
head that way at some point where they'll allow you to download stuff but

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:46.800
I think also people have to keep in mind is it really worth it downloading a game

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.560
like that especially with like a 360 you know where your system might conk out on

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.800
you then you gotta get a new one then you have to find some way to be able to

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.960
you know how to tie to your new system and also when you're done with it you

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:05.400
can't sell it off used which is another thing but you know that for some people

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:09.960
that might not be a big deal and you only have so much room I mean what your

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.760
hard drive fills up it fills up exactly that's kind of a bummer I mean sure they

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:18.080
can release a new hard drive but those hard drives ain't cheap I paid a hundred fifty bucks for my 120 gigabyte hard drive

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.840
yeah sadly enough those hard drives the actual parts don't cost that much and

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:26.600
that's the bad thing about it is I mean they're just laptop hard drives through

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:30.440
like a special connector it's just yeah don't remind me because I'm gonna get

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:38.400
more mad you keep talking Loki but hey hey but you remember though that is one

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.920
that is one plus though about the ps3 those they do let you upgrade your hard

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.240
drive and you don't have to buy a special hard drive from them it's just any hard

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:50.040
drive will do which I think is the way that Microsoft should have gone with

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:56.520
their hard drives if you ask me but what do I know? One thing I will say this you know

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:59.600
despite the hard time I gave the PlayStation 3 you know for many many

still want to go back to Lost Odyssey I haven't finished that your wife sure did

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:28.280
get to Fable II though yeah she burned through the whole game really quick by

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.720
the way your wife is pissed apparently she brought the wheat of the studio

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:34.000
tonight yes I brought the wheat of the studio and she's been playing Animal

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.120
Crossing quite a bit she got mad at me because I played it for four hours

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.760
yesterday she's not gonna be able to pay off her debt to Tom Nook well she doesn't

01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:44.200
care about that she we're time traveling right now so we're in we're actually

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:50.300
playing in July because we got bored with winter so yeah so now we're

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:57.600
collecting bugs but yeah she's very mad she fact said I have to be home by 10 so

01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:02.320
that she can play Animal Crossing did we do we tell everybody not make it Loki

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:06.320
might not be able to do the review yeah we're doing that preview tonight of

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.560
maybe we might not make it no it doesn't matter yeah I'll be there by 10 or

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:16.680
whatever yeah Tatsunoko vs. Capcom oh yeah very cool might be a short one

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.760
tonight yes see um in fact you probably should get all that shit hooked since we

01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:23.080
don't have the adjusted TV cam tonight you might want to get all that hooked up

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.240
before we I will wait one minute we go off air we can just go into that and be

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:31.360
done hey left 4 dead is another one of those games I really need to check out

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.760
at some point because I usually don't like to like first-person shooters that

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.640
much but it's valve and it's zombies it might be pretty cool and I've heard

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:39.640
nothing but really good things about this game except for the fact that

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:42.800
people have been cheating on the game but guess what valve did this week they

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.040
put the hammer down on that they fixed some exploits on the Xbox 360 version

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.480
but here's the interesting thing about it apparently there were some cheats

01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:55.000
around where players were spawning all sorts of items enemies I guess some some

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.720
type of exploit in the game valve was able to patch that server side so that

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:00.840
way they didn't even have to push out a patch and wait for that to be approved

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:04.600
from Microsoft so they fixed it on their end they put out a statement it is done

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.480
but what you can still do it on your local games right you still do the thing

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:13.400
because it only fixes this when you're playing the live games online basically

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:17.840
what they did is they use that there's a mod tool that you can you have a device

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.440
to basically rip files off your hard drive which they actually do sell them

01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.560
they're like 50 bucks think about picking one up because I need to buy

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:31.920
useless crap you can mod a file on there and it will allow you to do different

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:36.840
cheats in the game which might be fun because I like the cheating games and so

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:42.640
yeah let's go cheating for local games at least let's go cheating that would be

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:49.320
a fun game cheaters presents let's go cheating

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:54.480
I didn't mean like cheating on on did you relationship said you here and I've

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:56.960
seen this in our no no it's coming

01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:01.840

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:05.500
game out of for Grey's Anatomy I want to know they're they're doing it they

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:10.680
actually have the ESRB little descriptor on there you know how they are starting

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:16.160
to put descriptions other than just reading on and it's it's interesting

01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:24.040
they're ready for emo soundtrack no it's definitely not ready but yeah there's

01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:30.400
like you know I don't know if it's like trauma center with sex or something but

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:36.440
you know I don't know like let me hear you have to stop time on the center part

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:39.880
dating sim no let me let me read this real quick this is funny it's all from

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.640
the ESRB description for Grey's Anatomy it's a story based role-playing game

01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:47.520
this is a storyline contains frequent references to sexual encounters between

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:54.400
different characters and dialogue that contains sexual innuendo for example is

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:58.240
there anyone in this hospital you're not gonna sleep with and you want to have

01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:01.800
sex after surgery I don't know about you but that's not a sexual innuendo that's

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:06.380
you want to have sex after surgery some scenes take place soon after the

01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:12.520
characters have had sex dialogue also contains mine minor expletives for

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:18.600
example hell and ass and references to alcohol like you me at a row no hell and

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:25.920
ass alcohol this game looks like crap but they'll be funny though Grey's

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.640
Anatomy Grey's Anatomy the game amazing hey I gotta read some comments from the

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:35.120
chat about you and you and Nelly and the way you play Animal Crossing cuz they

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:39.040
had some comments here act-def says Animal Crossing the game about time

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:45.520
traveling and its effects let's see press start says Tom Nook is gonna break

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:49.400
her legs Tiger Claw says you better do what your wife says Loki you don't want

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:53.760
to have a divorce over the Wii and SSJ 100 Matt wonders aloud why does Nelly

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:59.040
have to cock block us and SSJ 100 Matt also makes this very winner comment

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:12.160
about the way you play Animal Crossing

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:16.360
cuz they don't have to go new change the actual date on your system you can

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:22.720
actually change the date in the game which is nice also I was trying I was

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:29.880
going to ask if you got a blue phone box in your town no we don't have a blue

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:35.480
phone box it has TARDIS dark to see us as Rocky or picture shows on Xbox Live

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:40.840
Netflix anything to look for that did you know that I'm not sure I didn't know

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:45.080
this until today but you can actually change out what bed you have in your

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:52.200
attic can you yes with any bed and by Tony dude I'm totally putting the regal

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:58.040
bed in my attic I wish I could decorate my damn attic I'm tired of my attic

01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:03.880
looking like wood to the bottom of your bed and it will allow you to change it

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:09.360
there should just be like misty says she's a screw that I wanted I want to

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:14.000
TARDIS I want to have my house be a TARDIS I'm kind of surprised they're not

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.160
trying to nickel-and-dime us yet in Animal Crossing with releasing the you

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.120
know stuff you have to pay for that you can get I bet Nelly do that they're not

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:27.280
that smart though that's the problem though with you know because here's the

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.160
thing is if they have that kind of content would be paid unlock content and

01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:34.080
if they have that in the game someone would figure out how to hack it and

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:39.600
unlock it already because we'll do that or like maybe okay the old school

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:42.960
Nintendo games like maybe just have the ones that I have on my virtual console

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:47.920
I don't know I guess I like this kind of dumb forget it never forget I said

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:52.920
anything all right let's let's get that statement of the show that we encourage

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:56.040
you to participate with our show every week by sending us emails mailbag at

01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:59.680
orange lounge radio.com and the dark soccer is gonna open up the mailbag I am

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.040
a few of her yes you are you better once you're gonna read a few of her favorite

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:10.280
emails right now I will subject her to watching really bad movies on Netflix I

01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:14.200
watched manos the hands of fate here's the thing I watched a documentary today

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:18.120
because I love Netflix for obscure fucking documentaries I watched one on

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:22.520
the 50 worst movies ever made man that's the hands of fate number one it didn't

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:26.160
even make the top 50 it didn't I will say this though this is awesome and

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:32.080
even in Time magazine instantly made me think of Loki number 11 I think it was

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:36.120
was some karate movie I don't remember the name of it I'll have to find it but

01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:43.480
the trick was the one dude had no arms and the other dude had no legs awesome

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:49.000
and they were actually karate fighting in the movie it was amazing I have to

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.320
figure out what I have to figure out what freakin movie it was maybe

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:57.440
something in channel no but it was did they tie themselves together I don't

01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:01.000
know themselves together made like a one person they like that character in

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.860
thrill-kill kind of sort of they were actually fighting with henchmen and it

01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:09.040
was it was amazing I mean these are so bad fucking movies

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:13.400
is again the worst 150 worst movies ever made it was number one number

01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:18.040
Number one had some long ass titles from the 60s, something like, it was like a musical

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:19.040
about zombies.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:20.040
Who put out the, um...

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:21.160
I have to see this.

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.500
I don't know who put it out.

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:26.520
I have to say this, the documentary itself wasn't that good, but the, and I love it.

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:28.520
I want to see the movie, screw the documentary.

01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.960
Yeah, I know, I just want to see the movie.

01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:33.960
Why is not Manos The Hands of Fate on there?

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:34.960
I don't know.

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:36.520
Is that because they MST3K'd it?

01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:38.080
I will say Howard the Duck was on it.

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.580
Howard the Duck was on it?

01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:40.580
As was Ishtar.

01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:42.960
I love Howard the Duck.

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:45.640
That's one of my favorite, was Xanadu on there.

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:47.240
Xanadu was on there.

01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:48.240
No!

01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.640
I love Xanadu!

01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:52.040
Yeah, I don't know how Manos The Hands of Fate wasn't on here.

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:54.080
It was a pretty poorly done documentary.

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.400
Maybe they only had access to one studio's films or something, but yeah, I gotta figure

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.400
out what that, what the name of that movie was.

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.400
Hold on, I'm getting it right now.

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:02.400
Okay.

01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:03.400
I'll have the...

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:04.880
If you say the name, I'll remember it.

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:05.880
Okay.

01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:06.880
DarkSaga, recent emails.

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.880
I'm going to play music again because we got on a tangent.

01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:09.880
Surprise!

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:10.880
Fighting Life!

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:11.880
No, that wasn't the name of it.

01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:15.360
It says The Crippled, oh, The Crippled Masters.

01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.360
That's it.

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.360
The Crippled Masters.

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.360
That's what it was called.

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.360
The Crippled Masters.

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:22.360
Fighting Life is the sequel, I guess.

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:24.000
Amazing.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
It had a sequel?

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Fuck.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.080
The Crippled Masters.

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:29.280
That's what it was called.

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:31.200
How about some emails?

01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.200
How about it?

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:34.000
Dun dun dun!

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
This comes from GS68.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Hey O.L.R.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Crew.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Oh no!

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
In return!

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.720
In The Crippled Masters, they actually attached themselves to each other to create that person

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:49.640
that I was saying they should do it.

01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:51.200
That's awesome.

01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.480
It says right here, so the two men are disfigured by their evil leader.

01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:58.880
It says one man has his arms cut off, the other has his legs burned off with acid.

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.880
The two men are enemies but struggling with being disabled.

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:06.840
One day, fighting each other, the wise old yoga master suggests they work together and

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:16.400
start training with weapons and team up to help them with the help of a shoulder harness

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:21.360
so that the man without the use of gloves lays or he meets the army for the other man

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.560
and vice versa.

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:26.640
Three words better than Voltron.

01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:27.640
That's awesome.

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:33.680
Okay, I'm watching this scene where they cut his arms off and this is pretty bad.

01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:35.080
I like it.

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.560
I have no arms.

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:38.960
Lowkey, you promise not to interrupt the emails now.

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:40.800
Alright, here we go.

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:41.800
Ew!

01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:42.800
God, that is disgusting.

01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:43.800
Okay.

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:44.800
I'm sorry.

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:45.800
Here we go.

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:46.800
One more time.

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:48.340
Oh, I have a question actually, Rob.

01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.240
Was The House Where Evil Dwells on there?

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:51.800
I don't remember.

01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:52.800
I don't think so.

01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:53.800
That's the movie?

01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.040
They had some really fucked up movie from the 70s though that was like just a total

01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:00.080
gore film and had titties and butts and blood and stuff.

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.080
I don't remember what the name was.

01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.080
It was awful.

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.080
I love The House Where Evil Dwells.

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:04.080
Okay.

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.080
I have a little story about this and then I'll do email.

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:06.080
Promise.

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:07.080
Promise.

01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:08.080
Promise.

01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:09.080
I love what Act Deaf said in chat.

01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:10.680
The Crippled Masters of Independent Podcasting.

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:13.000
No, that might be offensive though.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.360
There are people that are actually handicapped.

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:17.760
There are actually crippled masters out there who do podcasts.

01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:21.460
But you have to admit it's an awesome idea for a movie.

01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:22.880
It's not that the people have no...

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:24.600
But the fact that it's like that...

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:29.320
What was that movie with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder where one was deaf and one was...

01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:30.840
See No Evil Here No Evil.

01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:32.200
It's like that but karate.

01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:33.560
Okay, sorry Jamie.

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:36.160
Your point.

01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:37.160
Okay.

01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:38.160
So this movie...

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.160
It was...

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:40.160
Okay.

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:42.020
I saw it when I was like six.

01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:43.020
Something like that.

01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:44.020
And it was on Showtime.

01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:46.580
Back when Showtime was new.

01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:50.520
And it was at the time called The House Where Evil Dwells and I had no idea that was the

01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:51.520
name of it.

01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.400
I just remembered that it's about these people that move to Japan and get possessed by ghosts

01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:58.740
and end up killing each other.

01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.480
Like the ghosts killed each other.

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:04.620
And I had been trying for years.

01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:07.400
I mean decades to find this movie.

01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.880
I did not remember the name of it.

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.120
I was so little I didn't remember.

01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:15.700
But I remembered scenes from it including the ghost possessed crabs chasing the girl

01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:16.760
at the tree.

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:18.640
Which is why evil alien crabs always...

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:20.560
Giant alien crabs always make me crack the fuck up.

01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:23.120
Because I always remember they go to ROAR sound.

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:27.080
But you know like you hear like the...

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:30.720
For lack of a better description I guess like the Japanese ghost noise.

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:33.320
You know that sounds like really deep.

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:34.320
You know.

01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:35.320
Anyway.

01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:36.320
No.

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:39.680
That's a broken neck ghost woman.

01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:43.680
And that's more like...

01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:44.680
Anyway.

01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:45.680
This show's terrible.

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:46.680
So.

01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:47.680
Shut up.

01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:48.680
Anyway.

01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:49.680
So.

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:50.680
So.

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:51.680
At last.

01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:54.000
I think six months ago I finally.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.600
Finally found a review of the damn movie.

01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:59.440
Found the name of it and bought it on Amazon for five bucks.

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:01.680
And I'm making you watch it with me.

01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:03.320
No.

01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:04.880
You want some stuff that's gonna do with me?

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:08.280
Okay but we have to find the cheerleader movie that was on that list and watch that too because

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.280
that looked amazing.

01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:11.440
I want to see a cheerleader movie.

01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:12.440
Alright.

01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:13.440
Do we get to...

01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:14.440
No.

01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:15.440
Are they naked?

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.440
Can we do email now?

01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:17.440
Sure.

01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:23.440
But you totally need to see this movie.

01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.440
Okay.

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:25.440
God.

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:30.320
So.

01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:32.320
First email from GS68.

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:36.200
Hey OLR crew.

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:40.960
If you've already covered what I just brought up in the subject line just ignore this email.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:45.360
But anyways Sunnyvale Goughland is holding a location test for the North American version

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:49.840
of DJ Max Technica sometime next week.

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:54.080
Somewhere in the December 17th to 19th range and I thought I'd share this with you guys.

01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:58.760
Kudos to Corey Vertu from BimaniStyle for bringing this up.

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:02.240
I'm texting Shane right now to get a reaction out of him because I don't know anyone that

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.640
loves this game more than him and he's going to be pissed.

01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:09.200
I encourage people living in NorCal who are interested in Technica to come check it out.

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:15.600
GS68 PS this email was brought to you by Tetris the Grandmaster, home of the ending Tetrominoes.

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:16.600
Okay.

01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:17.600
I.

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:18.600
Okay.

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.600
So DJ Max.

01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:21.600
Yo.

01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:26.120
Have you seen this new one yet?

01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:27.440
I'm curious to check it out.

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:28.800
Shane made me watch YouTubes of it.

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:29.800
It looks interesting.

01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:30.800
Yeah.

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:31.800
With the whole like, with the touch.

01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:33.440
It doesn't look anything like the PSP one to me.

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.440
It's just the same music.

01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:38.280
I'd be curious to check it out.

01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.400
So moving forward.

01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:42.120
I might have to make, I don't have any plans next weekend.

01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:43.120
Okay.

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:45.120
Actually I have plans.

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:46.120
Cancel them.

01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:48.500
I'm going to Old Folsom and eating good food.

01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:49.500
And shopping.

01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:52.280
I'm going to eat good food and shop in the bay and play DJ Max.

01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:53.720
Who are you going with?

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:54.720
Becky.

01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:55.720
Bring Becky.

01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.720
She's not into video games.

01:58:58.720 --> 01:58:59.720
Oh.

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:00.720
Damn her.

01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:01.720
I'm just kidding.

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:02.720
That and she has a child.

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:03.720
All right.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:04.720
Fair enough.

01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:05.720
Who is teething.

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:07.360
Oh my God.

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:08.360
So moving forward.

01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:09.360
Hey guys.

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.360
Loki.

01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:14.520
A few episodes back you said that Wii music is for five year olds.

01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:15.840
I object.

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:20.280
My recently turned six brother loves to play video games and not only games.

01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:22.340
He plays Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.

01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:26.220
He strums and he yells at me to press the buttons while we work our way through Slow

01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:27.680
Ride.

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.720
There's your lol for the day.

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:30.720
P.S.

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:31.720
Skye.

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:36.000
Put the podcast up faster.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
P.P.S.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.320
I hope I pass the grammar Nazi test.

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:40.960
This is Orange Lounge.

01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:41.960
Geekboy2424.

01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:43.560
Think of it this way.

01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:45.400
You're going to get an awesome Christmas present pretty soon.

01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:48.120
Put in an ellipsis where you're not supposed to by the way.

01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:52.920
You're supposed to use two dashes and not an ellipsis.

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:55.120
I'll take care of that later.

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:56.480
No lecture tonight.

01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:00.040
However, the last email is fantastic grammar.

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:01.040
I find it beautiful.

02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:05.680
It actually is a card sent to us.

02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:11.320
It's actually sent to us from our friends at Super Happy Fun Time Show.

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:14.760
Super Happy Fun Time Show?

02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:15.760
I hate that show.

02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:16.760
No, I'm kidding.

02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:17.760
It's great.

02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:21.520
Please find attached our Christmas to you all at O.O.R.

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:26.240
We're not sending analog versions out as we're trying to save the planet.

02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:30.640
Have a great Christmas and New Year and we'll see you on the other side, whatever that means.

02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:34.120
That's a very creative idea to do your Christmas cards digitally.

02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:35.920
So I would like to see some holiday cards.

02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:37.960
I don't want to say Christmas because that's insensitive.

02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:41.800
I want Christmas cards.

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:45.840
I want it fucking loaded with baby Jesus.

02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:49.720
Okay, then fine.

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:53.000
For this week's mailbag, we would like to challenge you to send us Christmas cards and

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:57.880
they better be about Christmas and Jesus and Santa and all that stuff.

02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:03.960
Unless you want to do them about original Christmas and that's with yule logs burning

02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:07.000
and candles on trees and druids sacrificing things.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Fine, look, whatever.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.400
We want your Christmas cards via email this week.

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:13.280
So mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:14.280
I like that.

02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:17.040
And your banners for the PSP website, damn it.

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:20.880
VXJ6V, yes, that's a creative idea because I'm not talking about someone signing on to

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:22.840
like Yahoo greeting cards or whatever.

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:23.840
I'm talking about they actually...

02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:26.200
We want you to get into Photoshop and make it your damn self.

02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:29.040
Yeah, they made one and let me, maybe I should make that clear because I don't want to see

02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:30.480
the same damn e-card over and over.

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:34.240
They actually made a Photoshop little card that was cute.

02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:35.240
It was.

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:37.640
It was very nice and we appreciate it very much.

02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:45.320
I actually mailed all of four real Christmas cards this year and they were pretty cool.

02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:47.440
That's it for emails, I think.

02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:48.440
Is that it?

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:49.440
Nope.

02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:50.440
We got some spam.

02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:51.440
Fuck you.

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:52.440
All confirmed at eBay.com.

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:53.440
You shit.

02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:54.440
Done?

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.080
All right, there you go.

02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:00.120
If you want to send us emails, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:01.120
Back to the gaming news.

02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:02.120
Loki.

02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:03.120
All right.

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.640
Well, let's see here.

02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:06.680
We've got some other interesting stuff.

02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:10.320
This is a game that I was playing quite a bit right after it came out.

02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:15.800
I kind of put it off now since I have other things to be playing, but I want to go back

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:18.880
and maybe this will entice me.

02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:22.020
Mercenaries 2 is getting some new download content.

02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:30.480
They kind of teased this a little bit a while ago with their Obama and Sarah Palin characters.

02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:34.560
Well, this is all going to be part of the Blow It Up Again download content pack.

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:42.960
It is going to be free and it is going to contain a bunch of cool stuff, including some

02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:44.560
new modes.

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:48.560
They're going to have four new game types, including there is one that looked like a

02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:58.080
death race or something like that, and some other fun explosion-based games, which is

02:02:58.080 --> 02:02:59.080
kind of cool.

02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:09.360
Apparently, it will be coming out on the Marketplace December 16th, so that's pretty awesome for

02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.360
PS3 owners.

02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:14.480
I think the 360 is already out.

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:15.480
All right.

02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:19.920
Well, if you want to continue to expand the games that you might own, Guitar Hero World

02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:25.600
Tour is going to be offering five free download tracks, but only if you own the guitar bundle

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:26.600
of the game.

02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:31.160
So not buying the game by itself, not buying the big band box, just buying guitar and game

02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:32.160
by itself.

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:35.160
Supposedly, you're going to be getting five free songs, and here's the thing.

02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:38.240
It's not five pre-selected songs like it was a rock band.

02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:41.840
You'll just get to choose five free downloadable tracks.

02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:43.680
Details coming soon.

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:47.280
That's all we know right now, apparently, is that if you get the $90 guitar game bundle,

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:51.040
you will get to choose five tracks to download.

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.840
And I guess free is good, but it's kind of weird that they're doing it for just the guitar

02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:55.840
bundle.

02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:57.480
Does that strike anyone else as odd?

02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:58.480
Yeah.

02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:01.240
I think they're desperate because people already have guitars.

02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:02.240
You know what?

02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:05.720
I actually almost bought Guitar Hero World Tour.

02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:08.880
Every song in the song list that I really, really wanted to play was pretty much already

02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:09.880
in rock band.

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:10.880
I feel bad.

02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:13.400
I feel like rock band's so much better than Guitar Hero.

02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.500
I mean, it's so much more versatile, has a lot more tracks to play.

02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:20.160
We met some real nice people that worked on Guitar Hero at PAX.

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:21.160
That is true.

02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:26.360
But one thing I am excited about, though, is the music mixer.

02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:27.640
The studio mode.

02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:28.640
It's limited.

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:29.640
Really?

02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.640
Yeah.

02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:32.360
So, I don't know.

02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:33.360
It's...

02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:34.360
We'll see.

02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:36.720
Maybe when it comes down in price a little bit.

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:38.880
I think the price is one thing I'm having a hard time justifying.

02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.480
I do really need a new guitar, though.

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:42.840
In fact, I was playing the No Doubt stuff in rock band.

02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.040
Maybe if they get better downloads, too, I'd be on board.

02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:48.140
No Doubt has that album, right?

02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:50.280
And my roommate was watching me play it and was like, ah, it's too bad you don't have

02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:51.280
a second guitar.

02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.280
I actually want to play rock band right now.

02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:53.280
This is pretty cool.

02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:56.840
And I'm like, oh, I need to get a second guitar anyway, because I'm still using the Explorer.

02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:57.840
Still.

02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:01.360
And TigerClaw says, why buy the game when SingStar Abba was all you cared for?

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:05.640
I can't believe I left that out of my gaming week, but I did play SingStar Abba last night.

02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:06.640
It was a lot of fun.

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:07.640
Mm-hmm.

02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:08.640
Yep, yep.

02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:11.640
There you go.

02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:17.280
Well, this is definitely for the UK.

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:21.040
In February, Rise of the Argonauts is going to be coming out.

02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:27.600
It's an action role play game that's being put out by Codemasters.

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:38.200
They're actually, it's already out on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 everywhere else in Europe.

02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:45.600
However, the UK version had some problems with actually having space for the game.

02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:48.600
It really was only a retail issue.

02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:53.360
The publisher actually said that they tried to get it into retail in the UK, along with

02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:58.720
the others, but it was so busy they could not do it, so they actually delayed the UK

02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:01.880
launch, simply for retail reasons.

02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:08.000
It actually was supposed to be out in the US on February 16th, and everybody else as

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
of Friday.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Hmm.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000
All righty.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Cool.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:21.040
Let's see, you may remember back, man, I can't believe it's already been like over a year,

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:28.060
but Bioshock, they had some limited editions that came out that had the Bioshock Big Daddy

02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:29.760
figurine with it.

02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:36.560
Well, now to go with the Big Daddy is A Little Sister, and you'll actually be able to purchase

02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:37.560
these.

02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:43.360
They're from the Cult of Rapture, I'm not sure if they're actually being sold through

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:48.800
the website or not, but yeah, it's going to be a little sister figurine that will go along

02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:50.280
with it.

02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:54.320
That's kind of neat.

02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:59.520
No word on pricing or when it's going to be available, but soon I guess.

02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:01.240
All right.

02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:06.920
Hey, something that's available, Pac-Man is coming out on the mobile phones, and here's

02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:11.200
the interesting thing, it just came out in Europe, apparently, it's a mobile version.

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:17.920
256 levels, because the original arcade version also cracked out after 256 levels, but what's

02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:23.360
cool about this, the mobile game actually supports local matches via Bluetooth, and

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:26.320
remember the awesome game Pac-Man Versus, and what was so awesome about that?

02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:30.360
You could play as the ghost, you can do that in this mobile version as well.

02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:36.760
Now here's the thing, there is that kind of like fog or limited vision on the mobile phone,

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:40.760
but you know what, still kind of awesome.

02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:45.240
So there you go, if you're a mobile gamer and looking for a game to get, being able

02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:48.440
to play as the ghost definitely puts a whole new twist on Pac-Man, so that's available

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:52.600
right now in Europe, and I'm sure we'll come over here soon.

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:59.120
Well here's some happy news for Nintendo fans in the States, the DSi is supposed to be coming

02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:04.880
to North America in March 2009, which we knew we'd be getting it, I mean it's not like they

02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:09.120
wouldn't release it over here, but it's kind of nice to have a date, don't you think?

02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:12.560
It's already out in Japan, and so we've been hearing all about it, and I'm sure people

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:17.000
have imported it already, but now you don't have to, if you have patience.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Patience.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.120
It's a virtue.

02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:24.160
Sadly, I'm not virtuous, but oh well, I have to because I'm poor.

02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:26.520
I want it now, Daddy!

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:27.960
Do you want the goose that lays a golden egg?

02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:31.520
I want a goose that lays a golden egg!

02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:35.880
And it's also a very stressful episode on Wonder Shosen.

02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:38.960
Patience, patience, patience, patience, patience.

02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:41.200
God, I love Wonder Shosen.

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:42.200
I'm so sad that show only went.

02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:43.200
Never watched any.

02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:44.960
Oh, Jamie, you are missing out.

02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:47.960
Okay, if you're going to make me watch your crappy movie, I'm making you watch Wonder

02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:48.960
Shosen.

02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:49.960
Hey!

02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:50.960
It is a crappy movie, but it is fun-crappy.

02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:53.680
It's the hot dog highway!

02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:55.240
Daddy!

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:56.920
Mortimer!

02:08:56.920 --> 02:09:05.960
Anyways, there's a new game coming out called Treasure Trove, which is kind of an interesting

02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:06.960
name.

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:11.880
Basically, it's a game coming over from Asper Software, and what's unique about this game

02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:16.840
though is it's sort of got a little bit of an augmented reality twist to it.

02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:22.760
Basically, you'll play this game actually walking around, and it will pick up on Wi-Fi

02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:25.600
signals that are nearby.

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:30.520
And based on those Wi-Fi signals, it will kind of create treasures for you to be able

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:31.600
to collect.

02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:34.900
So you can actually walk around different places and find different treasures.

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:37.340
It's like a real-life treasure hunt, I guess.

02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:42.960
You might also remember that I want to say Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops did something

02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:46.320
similar to that effect as well.

02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:53.680
In fact, I think you could get different unlockable characters based on Wi-Fi spots.

02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:54.680
So that's kind of neat.

02:09:54.680 --> 02:10:01.040
I don't know if I like the fact that I have to walk around to find these Wi-Fi spots,

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:06.520
but neat nonetheless.

02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:07.520
Kind of interesting.

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:11.400
Is this kind of like the whole, what do they call it, geocaching thing?

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:14.880
Sort of, but not quite as cool.

02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:20.200
Tigerclaw says, I bet the treasures are actually just open Wi-Fi networks.

02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.280
That would be a treasure.

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:28.040
Hey, one more story about an announcement, possible announcement, coming to Consumer

02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:29.040
Electronics Show.

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:30.040
This could be some big gaming news.

02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:37.080
It's just a rumor, however it's coming from a research analyst for the firm Global Equities.

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:43.800
Apparently Microsoft could be unveiling a Zune phone at Consumer Electronics Show.

02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:47.200
Apparently the Zune phone, you can guess what it's probably trying to compete with, but

02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:49.080
it's supposed to have motion enhancement features.

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:53.200
It would actually have an accelerometer in it, a large multimedia screen in it, and a

02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:56.560
keyboard I guess that is on the screen.

02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:00.040
Now of course, the interesting thing about it is that although nothing is really said

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:03.680
about gaming right away, you would think, especially with the way the other big phone

02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:07.920
is going, and especially because Microsoft has that tie into the 360, and they've always

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:10.360
talked about that whole live anywhere thing.

02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:14.960
And they also showed off those downloadable XNA titles to the Zune.

02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:20.720
This would be really a great bridge between all that, especially with so many community

02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:21.720
games.

02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:26.000
The community thing has really exploded out there, and grad store buddy Aaron, who appears

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.880
to still be in the top 15 of the games on the community games, amongst all the stuff

02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:32.760
that's out there right now, props to him.

02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:35.680
But that would be very interesting if all these XNA games could suddenly be playable

02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:36.680
on the phone.

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:40.560
It's like they'd have this huge base of already made things.

02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:41.560
Excellent idea.

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.560
We'll see.

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:46.480
Although, I don't know, if they actually put out a Zune phone, would that be something you'd

02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:47.480
be interested in, Loki?

02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:49.240
Because I know you're like an Apple hater.

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:52.880
You know, Dark Soccer and I already have iPhones, so I can pretty much guess Dark Soccer would

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:56.360
have the same answer I would, that I'm locked into this phone for two years, even if I wanted

02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.360
one, I couldn't get it.

02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:58.800
But you, Loki, would you be interested?

02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:04.280
Not really, because usually with those plans for a phone like that, they have data plans,

02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:06.280
and it's expensive.

02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:10.800
I don't use my phone for browsing the internet and stuff, although I would probably like

02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:13.880
doing that, because it would come in handy sometimes.

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:17.660
But it would all depend.

02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:23.320
Maybe if they made a standalone Zune player that also played games, and you can download

02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:26.720
stuff maybe not the phone, then I might be interested in it.

02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:31.840
But it's not something I'm actually going to purchase as a phone.

02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:35.900
Rama in chat says, OK, Microsoft, you already have smartphones and Pocket PC's phones that

02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:36.900
are on the market.

02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:38.280
That's a whole lot better than iPhones.

02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:41.840
You don't need a damn Zune phone.

02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:42.840
We'll see.

02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:44.640
All right.

02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:47.720
That does it for stories tonight, and we'll get to some last minute stories in just a

02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:48.720
moment.

02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:52.400
But we are going to open up the Skype line right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username

02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:53.760
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:56.320
If you wanted to call and talk about the show tonight, please give us a call.

02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:00.360
We're only going to take a couple calls tonight, because we want to make sure we have time

02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:03.720
after the show for the Justin TV thing with Tatsunoko and Capcom.

02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:07.720
So we're going to try to abbreviate this so we get Loki home on time and not in trouble.

02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:08.720
And then I just want to...

02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:09.720
Well, I appreciate that.

02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:10.720
We don't need to do that.

02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:11.720
I don't want to stay up all night either.

02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:12.720
So...

02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:13.720
It's freaking cold in here.

02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:14.720
It is very cold in here.

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:17.720
So yeah, we're going to just take a couple quick calls while we're waiting for a call.

02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:19.720
Loki, you want to do some last minute stories?

02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:20.720
Yes.

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:27.040
There's a weird game that this company is showing off.

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:30.080
3D-AUS has a game called Funny Band.

02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:35.840
It's a Korean developer that's put it out, and it has a peripheral that combines both

02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:38.120
a keyboard, a guitar, and drum set.

02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:40.440
Now, you may ask, how the hell are they doing that?

02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:43.360
Well, the guitar looks kind of like a rock band guitar.

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:46.960
It has four frets on top, two frets on the bottom.

02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:50.740
And then also on that, there are two sets of keys.

02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:56.920
There's four keys on the bottom and three keys on the top, kind of, of the base of the

02:13:56.920 --> 02:13:57.920
guitar.

02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:01.220
And you flip the guitar over, and there's six drum pads.

02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:02.680
So that's kind of neat.

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:05.920
And the game itself kind of looks a little bit like, you know, a guitar hero or a rock

02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:06.920
band.

02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:13.000
But what's kind of cool is the actual board that the notes scroll down is kind of curved.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:18.160
So it's like, kind of, I don't know, the end of, like, Splash Mountain or something.

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:22.440
But the game itself looks kind of cool, and no word on exactly when it's coming out.

02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:28.440
But very neat, and a good way, I guess, to have all your peripherals in one spot.

02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:31.880
Sucks that you can't play drums and guitar though at the same time, not without it being

02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.200
very uncomfortable.

02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:41.640
Something else that's coming out, Brutal Legend, of course, was shown off during the Video

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.920
Game Awards show tonight.

02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:46.600
And EA is now bringing that game out.

02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:53.200
Of course, this used to be one of the properties of Nvidia before they got bought up by Activision.

02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:59.440
And now EA is putting out yet another game, a little bit different, not going to see Brutal

02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:05.680
Legend, you know, 2010 or something like that, but neat nonetheless.

02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:08.600
And then we were talking a little bit before about DJ Max Technica.

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:12.280
Well, DJ Max Technica is actually coming to the DS.

02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:17.280
And they're going to be doing a DS game that's going to also have some DSi features as well.

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:22.060
It's going to also use a DSi camera and have storage support, which is kind of cool.

02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:25.600
But very cool to see that this is going to be coming to the DS.

02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:30.280
I guess it'd be perfect since it's a touchscreen game, and the PSP versions have done very

02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:31.280
well as well.

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:34.880
All right, now we're finally getting calls, because apparently our Skype was on Don't

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:37.880
Disturb or something, and I finally figured that out thanks to a chat comment.

02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:39.320
And to reset it, now we've got a call.

02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:40.640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:41.640
Who's this?

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:42.640
Hello, Orange Launch Radio.

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:43.640
It is Jason.

02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:44.640
Hello, Jason.

02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:46.320
I come from the internet.

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:48.440
I was getting a little worried that no one was going to call tonight.

02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:51.280
I was like, that's a little embarrassing, but then I realized...

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:56.440
You were online the whole time, ever since you came on to do the tossover with Bobby.

02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:02.480
Yeah, usually we turn it off for the first hour and a half, but I got lazy tonight.

02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:03.480
Well what's up, Jason?

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:05.160
Oh, not too much.

02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:07.480
Just chilling in three degree weather.

02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:08.480
Just chilling.

02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:12.300
That's what it feels like here, even though it'd probably kill us if we told you how cold

02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:13.400
it actually is here.

02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:15.680
You'd probably be like, you're fucking babies.

02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:16.680
For the record...

02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:17.680
It's okay.

02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:21.320
This weather would have frozen me if I had still lived in Arizona at the time, so I could

02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:22.320
definitely understand.

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:25.320
47 degrees out, by the way.

02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:26.320
Whips.

02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:27.320
Whips.

02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:29.040
That's what, a Colorado summer?

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:30.040
All right, no, I'm kidding.

02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:31.760
What's up, Jason?

02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:32.760
That's it.

02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:34.800
That's pretty close, actually.

02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:38.120
I have had notes open ever since the start of the show.

02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:39.120
Home.

02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:41.120
Hooray, home.

02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:45.640
It's funny, because when you said that this was something that was popular in the 90s,

02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:48.680
all of these memories came fluttering back.

02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:51.880
There was two things that stood out.

02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:54.600
One of them was a company called World's 3D that...

02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:56.880
I remember World's 3D.

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:57.880
I never...

02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:02.440
The sad thing is I've never actually used any of these 3D World products back then.

02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:03.600
I didn't have my own computer.

02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:04.600
I was young.

02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:06.440
I didn't know nearly as much as I do now.

02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:08.720
You know, that kind of stuff.

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:12.680
World's 3D came out and tried to do this.

02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:19.960
I don't know if that's what ZDNet, the precursor to Tech TV, if that's what ZDTV spotlighted

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:24.520
at one point, but I remember seeing a 3D interface for web browsing.

02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:25.800
And you know what?

02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:28.560
It doesn't work.

02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:29.660
It's slow.

02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:33.040
We have a great interface for browsing the web.

02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.800
They're called web browsers.

02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:37.120
It presents everything in a great medium.

02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:40.280
What a concept.

02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:42.600
So you think home is just stupid, or what?

02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:45.080
It's...

02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:47.800
Bobby had it right, and I've said this to a couple people in the chat room, and I think

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:50.160
you even echoed it at the same time.

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:53.720
You want to compare it to Second Life, but you can't compare it to Second Life.

02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:58.040
Second Life is a game in the sense that you have production and you can play other people's

02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:00.240
production and whatnot.

02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:03.240
Home is an interface to...

02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:10.000
I mean, it's an alternative to the XMB, you could say, with the fact that they're trying

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.120
to integrate partying and game launching and that kind of stuff.

02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:18.600
Yes, it's a cross-media bar that says, fuck shit, nay, and fat, and all that stuff, you

02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:19.600
know?

02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:22.680
Yeah, it's another interface, and you know what?

02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:29.080
It's slow, and it takes forever, and it just doesn't work as well.

02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:30.080
That's not the...

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:31.560
Well, that's natural.

02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:33.840
It doesn't work on the digital mediums.

02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:37.080
It's not that smart.

02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:41.280
Well, you said you've been taking notes during the show.

02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:43.160
What else did you want to comment on?

02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:44.200
It was just a lot of this.

02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:45.780
It's kind of funny.

02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:50.480
Some of the things that Rai pointed out was that the repeated loading and downloading

02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:54.800
of all of the zones in the home reminded us an awful lot of Metal Gear Solid 4, the fact

02:18:54.800 --> 02:19:00.400
that you had to install more than every chapter worth of the game.

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:02.040
That was aggravating.

02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:04.560
That was the worst thing I've ever seen in a game.

02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:07.860
Did you know that Prince of Persia is the first PlayStation 3 game I've bought that

02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:11.280
had to do the installation thing, and it kind of caught me off guard?

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:17.120
I was like, whoa, hey, I forgot PS3 games do this, because all the other PS3 games I

02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:20.320
have, LittleBigPlanet didn't really do it, and it might have, but I totally didn't notice

02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:21.320
it.

02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:22.320
It did.

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:23.320
It's small.

02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:24.320
I just didn't notice it.

02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.320
I think I was doing something wrong.

02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:26.320
You notice that there's no more stories about those anymore?

02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:28.280
It's because every game does it now.

02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:31.840
I was actually going to say and ask the same thing about LittleBigPlanet.

02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:33.580
I don't remember an install.

02:19:33.580 --> 02:19:37.080
It did it, but it's just kind of short, and so is the Prince of Persia one.

02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.000
You'll notice the first time you play the game, it's slow to boot up, and I was like,

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.880
oh, this shit's installing on my hard drive right now, and sure enough, every time I've

02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:46.520
booted it since then, boop, comes right up.

02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:48.760
That's just so weird to me.

02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:51.440
But PC games have done this for years, right?

02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:53.200
That's a PC.

02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:56.680
The difference between a PC and a PC is that you have to support a lot.

02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:02.960
In a game console, developers should already know exactly what they need to do.

02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:09.920
I mean, you can say the same thing for download content, but I don't know.

02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:14.280
It just seems really weird in the way that the PC is kind of graying out with consoles

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:15.280
nowadays.

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:16.640
Let me say this, Jason.

02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:19.360
To me, it's weird, but it's not a deal breaker.

02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:22.600
I can put up with it, especially if it's just once at the beginning of the thing.

02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:25.780
I would only be more pissed off if it kept happening throughout the whole thing, which

02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:27.960
it sounds like it happens in Metal Gear Solid 4.

02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:28.960
Oh, my God.

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:34.000
And it's funny, because the first time it installs, it takes something like 10 or 20

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.720
minutes, I think, if memory serves correctly.

02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:39.860
And then every additional time it installs, it takes about three minutes.

02:20:39.860 --> 02:20:41.400
And I swear to God, it's a three minute.

02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:44.780
When we were playing through it and Wright was watching me play, when we were playing

02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:47.940
through it and we would get to these stupid installs, I would say, it's a three minute

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:54.000
Marlboro commercial, because Old Snake is sitting there smoking away right in your face

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:57.680
for three minutes, and nothing else is going on.

02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:00.280
He's just sitting there huffing and puffing.

02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:01.280
Comment from chat.

02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:04.760
Legend of Zaku says, bullshit, PC games installed faster than PS3 games.

02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:08.240
I got three words for you, Final Fantasy XI.

02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:11.160
You can't count download time.

02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:12.480
Download patches and updates towards that level.

02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:15.280
Well, even the game itself spawns across like four CDs.

02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:16.280
It's crazy.

02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:17.280
I don't even remember.

02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:18.280
All right, forget it.

02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:19.280
It doesn't matter.

02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:20.280
It's been too long.

02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:21.880
I understand the point he's trying to make, that some of those PS3 installs are very long,

02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:22.880
but you know.

02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:25.880
Anyway, Jason, I've got to rush you along, because we've got to take some more calls.

02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:28.080
Is there anything else you want to comment on tonight?

02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:33.060
One thing that I do want to say for myself, as much as I have a disdain for it, I think

02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:35.760
everything we say about home is a preview.

02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:36.760
It's not a review.

02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:40.260
There's very little content in there, and until we can start seeing things like clubs

02:21:40.260 --> 02:21:44.680
really happening, and club houses, and anything else that they actually do decide to sell,

02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:48.480
as soon as it's actually flourishing, it's a preview.

02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:52.940
But Jason, when you open it up to the masses like Sony has, that's not how everybody's

02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:53.940
going to view it.

02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:55.940
People are going to download this and go, this is home?

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:56.940
This is bullshit.

02:21:56.940 --> 02:21:57.940
And they're not going to look at it again.

02:21:57.940 --> 02:22:02.440
They've shrugged it off as the whole beta thing, but...

02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:04.800
I mean, they've pushed it to the cross-media bar.

02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:05.800
You have a point.

02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:06.800
It's right there.

02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:07.800
Yeah.

02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:08.800
Yeah.

02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:11.440
It definitely popped up as soon as I found out that it was open for everybody.

02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:12.440
I don't know.

02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:14.720
I stand by my comment, but I certainly understand yours.

02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:18.920
Okay, Jason, I think home is going to be one of those things that's a lot cooler in a year.

02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:24.100
It's like the PS3 itself, it's not going to realize its potential for like a year.

02:22:24.100 --> 02:22:25.100
That's a good point.

02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:28.920
Well, Lord knows we didn't buy our PS3 until recently, because the library, we didn't care

02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:29.920
about it.

02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:30.920
Yeah.

02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:34.800
We didn't have a need for Blu-Ray, which has also changed now, Blu-Ray movies, that

02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:35.800
is.

02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:36.800
Yeah, yeah.

02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:37.800
All right.

02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:39.800
Well, Jason, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank you

02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:42.040
so much for the call tonight, and you have a good one.

02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:43.040
Bye, guys.

02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:44.040
All right.

02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:45.040
Bye-bye.

02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:48.160
All right, if you want to give us a call, we'll do at least one more call, try to sneak

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:49.160
two in.

02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:52.840
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:55.680
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:56.680
Who's this?

02:22:56.680 --> 02:22:57.680
Hey, hey.

02:22:57.680 --> 02:22:58.680
It's your buddy from New York, Rama.

02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:00.440
Well, hello, buddy from New York, Rama.

02:23:00.440 --> 02:23:01.440
How you doing?

02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:02.440
I'm pretty good.

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:06.720
I was cold early, but now I'm happy I'm home.

02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:08.280
What's on your mind?

02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:09.280
Not much.

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:12.760
I tried to call you guys last week, but since SSJ100Man had told me you guys didn't have

02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:15.280
the 1-800 number, I had gone into an interesting...

02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:16.720
Yeah, we had issues last week.

02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:17.720
Sorry.

02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:22.520
Don't we all have issues once in a while?

02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:23.520
Yes.

02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:30.680
Yeah, but I had gone to an interesting concert last week and called Blip Fest 2008.

02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:32.400
I'm going to post a link in the chat.

02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:42.720
It's blipfestival.org, but basically, once a year, it's a concert of all types of classic

02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:49.640
8-bit programmers and gamers alike that program in with NES, Commodore 64, and they do all

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:51.840
kinds of various music with it.

02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:58.520
Sorry, I've been looking at the Wii stuff for setting up for After Show.

02:23:58.520 --> 02:23:59.520
I've been talking to you.

02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:03.800
I haven't looked at the website, but let me look.

02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:05.320
What convinced you to go out to the show?

02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:07.920
Well, a friend of mine told me about it last year.

02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:11.960
I couldn't get it, and I couldn't get a chance to go, but I am a big fan of Chiptunes.

02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:18.480
It's basically like the music that you guys play at the end of the show.

02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:24.080
I don't know if you heard the shows we did live at Penny Arcade Expo, but I wonder if

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:25.080
Bobby's listening.

02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:28.340
He'll say it in chat, but there was a guy that actually came on who did Chiptunes with

02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:31.760
his old-school brick Game Boy, and he was pretty rad.

02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:33.040
I think he came in...

02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:35.160
And he was playing them actually...

02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:37.320
It wouldn't have been the last day, because we weren't there the last day, because of

02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:38.320
our flight.

02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:39.320
It was the second day.

02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:41.540
So look for day two of the PAX podcast.

02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:42.600
We did it all games.

02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:46.160
And towards the end of the shows, when the guy came on, he was pretty awesome.

02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:47.760
Did you get his name or something like that?

02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:50.160
I don't remember it off the top of my head, sadly.

02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:53.120
I know we had it at the time, and I apologize if Bobby's listening.

02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:54.120
He'll remember.

02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:55.120
Okay.

02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:01.600
Yeah, a lot of the performers on stage were actually meeting, and with Game Boys, there

02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:08.220
was one artist that I think his name was Nordliff, or N-R-U-S-K, actually had two Game Boys and

02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:14.200
basically switching back and forth through a mixer.

02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:17.400
You had another group I saw on Sunday called Starscream.

02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:21.440
Pretty much what they were doing was, you had one person on the Game Boy and another

02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:25.360
person on drums.

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:28.720
It was just like a non-stop dance party or what?

02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:29.720
Something like that.

02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:37.840
It turned into like this awesome eight-pick electro rave, and there was a lot of crowd

02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:38.840
surfing.

02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:39.840
It was just great.

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:44.360
It ran an hour late, but it was well worth it, because my favorite group was on stage,

02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:45.360
Onamanaguchi.

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:52.200
Basically, their background beats is eight-pick, N-E-S, and you have one on drums, a lead,

02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:54.680
a bassist, and another guitarist.

02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:56.600
I just can't remember what his part was.

02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:59.720
Okay, I actually found it.

02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:03.100
Of course, somebody in chat says it right, as I find it myself, but his name was Paul

02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:06.320
Owens, and he's the director of the movie Reformat the Planet.

02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:08.680
Oh, okay, that artist wasn't there.

02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:09.680
Okay.

02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:13.760
Anyway, sorry, when you said chiptunes, I just remembered that particular performance

02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:14.760
was pretty awesome.

02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:16.680
But I know what you're talking about.

02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.840
This is kind of a big part of how 8-Bit Weapon kind of got their sound, you know?

02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:21.840
Definitely.

02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:23.720
I love 8-Bit Weapon.

02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:25.000
So that's cool.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.880
It's funny that this stuff's gotten bigger and bigger.

02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:28.880
Definitely.

02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:34.400
Now, from what I saw on Sunday, I would recommend these artists to check out.

02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:40.840
Starscream, Syphus, Nordloaf, and Onomatoguchi, and USK.

02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:42.560
Those are my five favorites.

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:47.600
If you have a nostalgic 80s feel to you, Trash 80 is really good.

02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:49.600
How much did this whole thing cost you?

02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:52.040
Actually, it was $15.

02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:54.640
It was a four-night event.

02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:56.600
It's $50 for all four nights.

02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:01.200
If you paid $60, you get a DVD of Blitz Festival 06.

02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:02.560
I just went for Sunday.

02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:05.600
And I just picked up 07 DVD.

02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:10.080
And I will tell you this, the way they remixed the music on that DVD, even if you have it

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:14.920
defined almost near where no one can still hear it, it's still loud, and it's really

02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:15.920
good.

02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:16.920
All right.

02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:17.920
Well, it sounds like you had fun.

02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:19.840
I wish our phone lines had been open last week.

02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:20.840
Yeah.

02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:26.160
And half the fun was just the visuals, I mean, the guys on stage, you saw, like, flashbacks

02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:28.540
of 8-Bit gaming and everything.

02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:32.440
I got to get the pictures up soon, but I did catch one screenshot of the samurai show that

02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:35.420
went out on battle screen.

02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:37.880
Wake me up when they have Guardian Legend.

02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:39.800
I didn't see any Guardian Legend.

02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:41.080
I'm just saying.

02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:42.080
I know.

02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:43.080
I know how much you love it.

02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:44.080
You know.

02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:45.080
It's not just me.

02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:46.080
Dark Sakura, too.

02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:47.080
Yep.

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:50.600
I think Loki has a soft spot for it, too, maybe not as strong.

02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:54.000
The Force is not strong with him, but, you know, a little bit.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.000
All right.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I'm staring at that screen, and happy fangirl is...

02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000
We'll get to it.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000
We'll get to it after the show.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.200
Sorry, we got Tatsunoko vs. Capcom up on the screen now.

02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:03.200
Finally.

02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:04.200
We're going to get to it soon.

02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:05.200
Rama, we've got to let you go.

02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:06.200
We've got to let you go.

02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:07.200
We've got one more call.

02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:08.200
All right.

02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:09.200
Can I say one more thing and I can get out of here?

02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:10.200
Of course.

02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:11.760
Jamie, that song, it's Pitch Black.

02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:16.200
It's off the MC Frontline album Secrets from the Future, so you know which one it is.

02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:17.200
Okay.

02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:18.200
Cool.

02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:19.200
Awesome.

02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:20.200
Got it.

02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:21.200
All righty.

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:24.880
Actually, did you get a chance to check out the new album?

02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:27.560
I think it's in my roommate's car, but I'll have to check it out soon.

02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:28.560
Very much worth it.

02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:29.560
Definitely.

02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:30.560
All right.

02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:31.560
Bye, Rama.

02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:32.560
Bye.

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:33.800
We'll take one more call.

02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:34.800
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:40.600
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call right now.

02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:41.600
Any other last minute stories?

02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:42.600
Did we get them all?

02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:43.600
No, we didn't.

02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:44.600
All right.

02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:45.600
Go ahead.

02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:46.600
It's music news stuff.

02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:48.920
Pearl Jam's 10 album is coming to Rock Band in March.

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:52.440
That was announced at the Spike VGA.

02:28:52.440 --> 02:29:01.800
They want me smoking last night.

02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:03.800
Spoken.

02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:09.200
And then Guitar Hero Metallica, there's some stuff coming out about it, including that

02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:17.280
it's going to have a new, more difficult Expert Plus drum setting.

02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:21.200
And apparently you're also going to be able to get some new Metallica drum sounds for

02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:22.800
your drum fills and stuff like that.

02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:25.000
Hurry for my broken drum set.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:26.000
And?

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Yeah.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Sorry, I picked up our caller.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Who's this?

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.000
This is Akiripur.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Hey, Akiripur.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000
What's on your mind?

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I'm, well, what is it?

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:44.080
I'm, as you haven't heard, I'm back in WoW playing on the US server once again, actually.

02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:45.080
Congratulations.

02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:47.080
Oh, well.

02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:58.800
Well, Andrew, I thought you were going to go up to us, that you can now change your,

02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:01.440
totally re-customize your character in WoW.

02:30:01.440 --> 02:30:02.440
Yes.

02:30:02.440 --> 02:30:03.440
That's right.

02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:06.160
There was some new news.

02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:08.600
There was some new news that came out this week, is that now you can totally go back

02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:10.000
and re-customize your character.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:14.080
You were able to before, after the patch, you could do the hair.

02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:16.320
And you could change some of the facial features that way.

02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:21.040
But now, you can go in for a total makeover, which is where you can change everything about

02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:22.940
your character's looks, basically.

02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:25.940
But you can't change the race, you can't change the class.

02:30:25.940 --> 02:30:29.000
So if you're a Tauren druid, you have to stay a Tauren druid.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.720
Or probably better, because they're the only ones that can be druids.

02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:36.280
But a good example would be something like, if you are a undead warlock, you can't switch

02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:40.120
to, you know, like a troll warlock or something, you've got to stay undead.

02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:41.120
Troll warlock.

02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:42.760
The interesting, oh, whatever.

02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:48.240
The interesting thing is, is that, I don't play a warlock, obviously.

02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:51.760
The other interesting thing is, is that you can change the gender of your character, so

02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:53.840
you can now give your character a sex change!

02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:54.840
Whee!

02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:55.840
Yay.

02:30:55.840 --> 02:31:01.640
And, well, here's the other thing, is that, well, as one sort of, well, I don't know if

02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:08.880
you're supposed to be, but as one cross-dresser sort of like, since I'm not considered myself

02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:10.920
fully lone fanny.

02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:14.520
I would say, but, that doesn't matter!

02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:17.480
We already play as girls already!

02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:23.280
Yeah, my character, I play as a Tauren female, because who plays a Tauren female?

02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:25.600
I'll tell you, nobody plays a Tauren female.

02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:26.600
You do.

02:31:26.600 --> 02:31:27.600
Yeah, me.

02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:29.000
And there's probably like five on the entire server.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.480
In his sassy pants?

02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:31.480
Yes.

02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:33.480
I usually don't give out the character name of the server.

02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:34.480
Sorry.

02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:35.480
Yeah, no, that's fine.

02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:36.480
Sorry.

02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:38.160
I don't want random tells, nah, they're probably fine.

02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:39.160
It's alright, I don't care.

02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:43.280
But yeah, I just don't need the random emails of people saying, I looked up your character

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:48.840
in the armoury, and she sucks, because that'd tell them exactly what they could do.

02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:50.840
But anyway, sorry.

02:31:50.840 --> 02:31:58.760
I'm making a process of levelling up, speaking of warlocks, a warlock, and I get to level

02:31:58.760 --> 02:31:59.760
30.

02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:06.480
It's damn, it's damn, I could say it's damn nice that you get your amount at level 30

02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:07.480
nowadays.

02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:08.480
Oh, it's amazing.

02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:10.240
They made a lot of great changes.

02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:13.640
One change I really like that they did is that now you have the heirlooms.

02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:17.920
So if you have a level 80 character, and if you save up your badges or winter grass marks,

02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:21.880
you can buy these heirlooms, and you can send them, they're bind to account, meaning you

02:32:21.880 --> 02:32:26.760
can send these items to any player on your account, and they actually scale in level.

02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:30.840
And what's cool is that the shoulders heirlooms that you can buy scale in level, so you can

02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:35.520
send them to your level one character, and they get a 10% experience bonus gain in addition

02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:37.300
to the pretty awesome stats.

02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:42.760
So kind of neat.

02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:43.760
That seems quite nice.

02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:44.760
Oh well.

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:50.880
Well, other than that, well, I have nothing to remark about, apart from like, yeah, I

02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:53.760
should say, point out, check out Left 4 Dead.

02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:57.280
It's really nice.

02:32:57.280 --> 02:32:58.280
Where's this?

02:32:58.280 --> 02:32:59.280
What is this?

02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:00.280
Left 4 Dead.

02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:04.400
Oh, Left 4 Dead, oh, yeah, yeah.

02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:10.040
When the demo was released, I got up to plate, so.

02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:13.080
But it really is something.

02:33:13.080 --> 02:33:21.240
The only thing you have to point out is that you really do need four people and mics, and

02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:27.200
all of them need to have mics, else there really isn't any fun.

02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:34.160
All right, well, I gotta let you go, because the chat wants less Warcraft and more Tatsunoko

02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:36.880
versus Capcom, so we're gonna wrap up the show.

02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:39.120
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that, too, so.

02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:41.080
All right, well, take care, buddy.

02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:42.080
Yeah, same.

02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:43.080
Thank you for the call.

02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:45.680
We enjoy hearing from our listeners from afar.

02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:48.880
I do have commentary about Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:49.880
Which would be?

02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:56.200
I like the music that they've put up for the characters, that for Ken, they give him the,

02:33:56.200 --> 02:34:01.280
okay, gotcha on history, for the first 13 episodes of the series, it had a more sedate

02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:06.000
opening, and the da-da-da theme that everyone knows was the closing theme, and then they

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.000
switched it over because all the fans liked the big one better.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:14.280
So Ken gets that theme, but Jun gets the original opening, which I thought was pretty funny.

02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:21.400
And that's it for me being a total Tatsunoko fangirl nerd.

02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:26.200
And Dan laughed at me because I was singing along with it while I was playing the other

02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:28.640
day.

02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:34.920
All right, we're going to go around and give everybody's final thought and wrap up tonight's

02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:35.920
show.

02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:36.920
We're at the end of the show.

02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:37.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:38.920
I didn't get it.

02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:39.920
More last minute stories.

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:40.920
Sorry, yes, last minute stories.

02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:41.920
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:42.920
No, that's all right.

02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:43.920
Okay, back to Guitar Hero Metallica.

02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:46.200
They have a partial track list out from it now.

02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:49.480
On top of the Metallica songs, there's going to be some songs from other bands that worked

02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:51.320
with Metallica and stuff like that.

02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:58.320
Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Turn the Page, Judas Priest, Hell Bent for Leather,

02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:06.040
Cyrus with Demon Cleaner, Lynyrd Skynyrd with Tuesdays Gone, Mastodon, Blood and Thunder,

02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:14.240
looks like the Michael Sheckler group, Armed and Ready, Samhain, Mother of Mercy, and The

02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:16.280
Sword, Black River.

02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:23.000
And there's also apparently some unannounced tracks by Slayer, Queen, and the Foo Fighters.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:26.800
I guess this is all coming from the new Game Informer.

02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:28.720
It's going to have some info on that.

02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:33.860
Also the Metallica tracks in there, Enter Sandman, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Fuel, Hit

02:35:33.860 --> 02:35:41.600
the Lights, King Nothin', Master Puppets, and No Leaf Clovers, Nothing Else Matters,

02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:47.640
Sad but True, The Unforgiven, and Where I May Roam, so that's kind of cool.

02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:54.720
And let's see, some other stuff, download content coming to LittleBigPlanet, including

02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:01.680
a Santa costume you can get now, it'll be available free on December 18th, and they're

02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:09.920
going to have it in two parts, so you can make your Santa sack boys, and I downloaded

02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:10.920
that by the way.

02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:14.960
I haven't played LittleBigPlanet in a couple days, or actually a couple weeks, just because

02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:18.580
I've been playing other stuff like Prince of Persia and stuff, but yeah.

02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:19.580
And that's it.

02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:20.580
Got it.

02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:24.080
Alright, now we're going to go around and give everybody's final thought and get on

02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:28.480
out of here so we can get to our post-show, and then the Tatsunoko Capcom stuff will be

02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:29.480
fun.

02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:36.400
Everybody's final thought, Dark Soccer, we'll start with you, what's your final thought?

02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:40.080
They're the white shadow.

02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:42.080
Because if you know Gachamon.

02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:43.080
I don't.

02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:49.280
Anyway, I forgot the whole stupid speech, so whatever.

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:51.720
More Gachamon, less wow.

02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:58.640
My final thought is, wow, I love my new, I have a tanuki suit hoodie that I have now

02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:01.680
that's awesome, I wore it out last night and I got compliments on it, but the best part

02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:05.260
about it, on the actual hoodie, is little cat ears.

02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:08.160
So you actually look like, I'll go out and get it.

02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:09.160
Oh, never mind.

02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:14.680
Yeah, I don't have it out right now, but I'll wear it out sometime when we go out to not

02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:18.600
go to the test location of DJ Max Technica, because you know, you're like, I gotta go

02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:19.600
shopping.

02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:22.480
Let's get some shoes.

02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:23.480
Let's get some shoes.

02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:24.480
Loki, your final thought?

02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:27.760
Uh, my final thought is I gotta find Cage Man's song.

02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:28.760
You better hurry.

02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:32.440
