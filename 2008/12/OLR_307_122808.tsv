54000	56000	Talk about the latest and greatest in video games
56000	58000	Video gaming, gaming culture
58000	60000	And the gamer lifestyle
60000	62000	My name is Rob Roberts
62000	64000	Joining us as always, say hello to the one and only
64000	66000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
66000	68000	I'm sad, Rob
68000	70000	Why are you sad?
70000	72000	It's the last show of the year
72000	74000	I know, it's the last show ever
74000	76000	And my nap got disturbed
76000	78000	How did your nap get disturbed?
78000	80000	I was napping and suddenly it was showtime
80000	82000	Thanks
82000	84000	Hit the ground running tonight
84000	86000	The show before us, Bobby, you know we love Bobby
86000	88000	He was running a little long tonight
88000	90000	Because he had a bunch of guests on
90000	92000	They were doing 2008 reviews
92000	94000	We were just kind of chilling
94000	96000	And it kept going and going
96000	98000	So we were like, let's take a cat nap
98000	100000	But then our chat room was getting restless
100000	102000	As they might say overseas
102000	104000	Rude
104000	106000	A little bit rude
106000	108000	But it's all good
108000	110000	It's handy
110000	112000	So anyhow
112000	114000	We're going to get the show started
114000	116000	Talk about the latest in gaming this week
116000	118000	And some of the highlights of 2008
118000	120000	And gaming, we have listless tonight
120000	122000	What about Loki?
122000	124000	Ah, fuck Loki
124000	126000	No, I'm just kidding
126000	128000	Everybody say hello to Techmaster Loki
128000	130000	I don't want to talk to you anyways
130000	132000	I'm sure he'd make his presence known at some point anyway
132000	134000	I haven't gone into the gaming weeks yet
134000	136000	But he still learned hello
136000	138000	And if you haven't gone into the gaming weeks
138000	140000	And still forgot Loki
140000	142000	Then you could yell at me
142000	144000	Rob, don't you know that the first rule of parenting
144000	146000	Is maintain a schedule in order
146000	148000	Am I your daddy?
148000	150000	Oh baby
150000	152000	Also say hello to the one and only
152000	154000	Arcadian42 is joining us tonight
154000	156000	Straight from the ultra-sensitive mics
156000	158000	Yes, the ultra-sensitive mics
158000	160000	Wanted to come and bother you for a show
160000	162000	No, please do
162000	164000	You know, it was funny
164000	166000	I had a bunch of people sending me private messages
166000	168000	Before the show began tonight
168000	170000	Do you have anyone coming? Do you have anyone coming tonight?
170000	172000	And I was like, no
172000	174000	I'm like, aren't the three of us good enough?
174000	176000	Well, I didn't know you were coming
176000	178000	And then you showed up and I'm like, oh good
178000	180000	This will appease those people that were thinking
180000	182000	We'd have some big, festive, year-end special
182000	184000	When in reality, most people that usually come on the show
184000	186000	Are out of town
186000	188000	And of course, prepare to be disappointed
188000	190000	When I don't say too much
190000	194000	I haven't played any of the most, almost none of the games this year
194000	196000	You know what, you'll just have to make your presence known tonight
196000	198000	And when in doubt, just do what
198000	200000	Rice Princess does and just fart in the mic
200000	202000	Okay, there you go
202000	204000	We've decided, though, what your special power is
204000	208000	The ability to show up at any party
208000	210000	And still be there
210000	212000	Yes
212000	214000	Playing pinball
214000	216000	Just sit in a corner and you
216000	218000	Don't notice me until
218000	220000	No, it's like
220000	222000	And we have no problem with this
222000	224000	We just think it's funny
224000	226000	Dan and I were talking about last time you were at one of our parties
226000	228000	And we were just wandering around the house
228000	230000	And people were starting to head off
230000	232000	And nothing's going on in the garage
232000	234000	At least so we think
234000	236000	We go into the garage and there he is
236000	238000	Playing
238000	240000	You're turning the light out
240000	242000	And you hear this voice
242000	244000	I was about to
244000	246000	And all of a sudden
246000	248000	I hear sound effects
248000	250000	From what machines do we have in there right now
250000	252000	Indiana Jones
252000	254000	No, we were fixing that one
254000	256000	But I was just hearing sound effects
256000	258000	I was like, what the crap? Oh, hi
258000	260000	I have nowhere to go
260000	262000	No, we thought it was funny
262000	264000	So that's your mutant power
264000	266000	And if you hear crackles tonight
266000	268000	In the sound, it's not your guys' iPods
268000	270000	Or speakers or what have you
270000	272000	One of our mics is strange tonight
272000	274000	And Bradley
274000	276000	This is the most you've ever talked
276000	278000	Like ever
278000	280000	This is a special day
280000	282000	God bless us, everyone
282000	284000	I'm just saying
284000	286000	Okay, Tiny Rob
286000	288000	Alright, let's go to
288000	290000	Hey, it's not the side, this is how you use it
290000	292000	Let's get into your gaming week
292000	294000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
294000	296000	It was semi-eventful
296000	298000	I played stuff
298000	300000	I started Ragnarok Online DS
300000	302000	And I was like
302000	304000	Ooh, Ragnarok
304000	306000	Talking and talking and talking and talking
306000	308000	And talking and talking and talking
308000	310000	Wow, I read like a Japanese five-year-old
310000	312000	Talking and talking and talking and talking
312000	314000	And talking
314000	316000	Finally, action!
316000	318000	We're gonna fall off a cliff
318000	320000	Shit, we landed on this guy
320000	322000	Let's talk to him
322000	324000	Well, it's a novice at these graves
324000	326000	Which I'm guessing are his parents or some shit
326000	328000	But he goes and hears the thump
328000	330000	And it's this girl from
330000	332000	Who's one of the shaman class that was made for the game
332000	334000	And so he's like talking to her
334000	336000	She's all up in his face
336000	338000	Bump, bumping him back and everything
338000	340000	He's like, what are you doing hitting him with your boobs?
340000	342000	So it was like
342000	344000	Talk to me!
344000	346000	I forgot his name
346000	348000	But I was like, text in blue
348000	350000	I can read it
350000	352000	And it was named one of the towns
352000	354000	I was like, okay, good
354000	356000	All the towns are gonna be written in katakana
356000	358000	And I can read that shit
358000	360000	And it was
360000	362000	It actually, when it goes through big dialogue scenes
362000	364000	It has you saved periodically
364000	366000	So I've saved
366000	368000	And I've done my stats too
368000	370000	So I at least
370000	372000	Remember that all my stats are in the same place
372000	374000	Because I recognize the kanji for strength
374000	376000	And so I was like, well, strength is always the first one
376000	378000	So maybe the next one is agility
378000	380000	And the next one is intelligence
380000	382000	And blah blah blah blah
382000	384000	Okay, but besides the talking, does it play like the online one?
384000	386000	I haven't gotten that far
386000	388000	I'm just talking right now
388000	390000	So I was like, well, I should go to bed
390000	392000	So I did
392000	396000	And I tried to go back and play some more Order of Ecclesia and I still suck
396000	402000	Well, because I just need one more level worth of life bar and I'll be okay
402000	404000	Because I was like, right toward the end of the forest
404000	406000	Stupid freaking forest!
406000	408000	It's like worse than Simon's Quest
408000	412000	What a horrible night for a curse
412000	414000	And so
414000	416000	Anyway, so anyway
416000	418000	I also
418000	420000	I went with my friend Becky
420000	422000	And we got her husband an Xbox
422000	424000	Well, she did that technically
424000	426000	She got the family their Christmas present of an Xbox 360
426000	428000	And she gave him
428000	430000	A big fat gift certificate to GameStop
430000	432000	And I was like
432000	434000	Well, if you were gonna actually pick out games for him
434000	436000	You should get him
436000	438000	Fallout 3
438000	440000	And Fable 2
440000	442000	And the Orange Box
442000	444000	All of them
444000	446000	Awesome
446000	448000	Hell yeah
448000	450000	So anyway, so I actually got to see some of
450000	452000	Fallout 3 and I thought it was pretty cool
452000	454000	I didn't play any because those games make me freaking
454000	456000	Nauseated as hell
456000	458000	Did you get to hit the button that makes the baby talk?
458000	460000	I haven't really played Fallout 3 yet
460000	462000	But I was listening to Bobby talk about it on the last show
462000	464000	When they were talking about the
464000	466000	I don't remember what it was, but he was talking about slamming on the button
466000	468000	That makes the baby talk and I'm like, wow, that sounds kind of awesome
468000	470000	That could be the best game ever
470000	472000	And I played some Animal Crossing
472000	474000	So that I could harass Jingle
474000	476000	Who I think is on crack
476000	478000	Oh shit, I forgot about Holidays and Animal Crossing
478000	480000	Because he has the starry eyes
480000	482000	And I think that it really means that Jingle is on crack
482000	484000	So he won't sleep at all that night
484000	486000	So it's like, here's your presents
486000	488000	Kids
488000	490000	And, and, and, and
490000	492000	I downloaded something on my phone
492000	494000	What's that?
494000	496000	Well, two things. First of all was the
496000	498000	8,000 cocktail drink mixing guide
498000	500000	For free
500000	502000	Hey, we're having our
502000	504000	New Year's party at Julie's house
504000	506000	And I need to be drunk
506000	508000	Because it's Julie's house
508000	510000	Sorry
510000	512000	No offense to Julie if you listen
512000	514000	Intoxicated enough to play
514000	516000	To actually sing karaoke
516000	518000	We will have a special guest
520000	522000	Who will be here for this party
522000	524000	Namely, Sauce
524000	526000	Oh, is she coming to town?
526000	528000	No, she's actually going to teleport in
528000	530000	And show up just for five seconds
530000	532000	That night and leave
532000	534000	Yes, she's coming
534000	536000	Alright, I think I'll see you at Gaming Week
536000	538000	Before I smack you
538000	540000	I did play other stuff, I played Rhino Rock Online
540000	542000	The real thing
542000	544000	The real one for free
544000	546000	And someone gave me a mistress card
546000	548000	For Christmas
548000	550000	And I was like, ooh, a mistress card
550000	552000	Is that like a business card?
552000	554000	Like if you ever need a mistress to be called?
554000	556000	A stupid bee
556000	558000	That I hate
558000	560000	She's one of the MVP things
560000	562000	And then you get a card
562000	564000	That makes you not have to use gems
564000	566000	To cast stuff
566000	568000	Which is helpful and useful
568000	570000	Only I forgot to put it in something
570000	572000	So I got that
572000	574000	And
574000	576000	I played with the City of Heroes character creator
576000	578000	A lot, the Korean one
578000	580000	I hear it's the best part of the game
580000	582000	That's why I have the Korean character creators
582000	584000	I haven't played the whole game yet
584000	586000	I'm thinking about playing it
586000	588000	Because I was really thinking about it
588000	590000	I was like, dude, why would I even remotely
590000	592000	Want to play World of Warcraft again?
592000	594000	Because I was just looking at
594000	596000	Different stuff going on
596000	598000	I was like, dude, I don't want to play that anymore
598000	600000	So I'm kind of waffling again
600000	602000	So that's really it
602000	604000	For my Gaming Week
604000	606000	Let me read some chat comments
606000	608000	You can always join our chat room
608000	610000	Chat.orangelaundry.com
610000	612000	GS68 comments on
612000	614000	Both you and I have said
614000	616000	Things about the level of difficulty in the
616000	618000	Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game
618000	620000	And I don't know if it's just because we suck at games
620000	622000	Now that we've gotten older
622000	624000	Or the game really is kind of a step harder
624000	626000	But GS68's thoughts is
626000	628000	At least Ecclesia is think on your feet hard
628000	630000	Not stupid hard like Circle of the Moon
630000	632000	Yeah, well, this is what I've noticed
632000	634000	I've actually got pretty good
634000	636000	Reaction time through the
636000	638000	Through the forest
638000	640000	I sped through the first level
640000	642000	I really just sped through it
642000	644000	And I think that
644000	646000	I would probably
646000	648000	Do better with about another level's worth of life
648000	650000	And then I can get through it
650000	652000	Because it's like
652000	654000	This one place that I always end up
654000	656000	Getting smacked around at
656000	658000	Since you didn't get your time gaining experience points
658000	660000	So
660000	662000	So I'm going to go back and
662000	664000	And we have an offer from Xenocore in chat
664000	666000	Who's on the justice server in City of Heroes
666000	668000	Well, thank you kindly, sir
668000	670000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
670000	672000	It was okay
672000	674000	I played more
674000	676000	Dissidef
676000	678000	Or Dissidia
678000	680000	Of the new Final Fantasy
680000	682000	I don't even know who you want to call the fighting game
682000	684000	To me, it's very similar to
684000	686000	Crisis Core a bit
686000	688000	Because Crisis Core, if you've ever played it
688000	690000	Is pretty much all battles
690000	692000	I mean, there's a little bit of
692000	694000	Kind of dialogue
694000	696000	And little plain stuff
696000	698000	In between, but you have kind of
698000	700000	Your main base that you
700000	702000	Do all your purchasing of items and stuff like that
702000	704000	But Dissidia is all
704000	706000	Fighting
706000	708000	And you can purchase items actually
708000	710000	Through your status screens
710000	712000	Stuff like that
712000	714000	Which I finally figured out how to do
714000	716000	Because I was like, well what the hell am I getting Gil for?
716000	718000	I can't use this for anything
718000	720000	And I'm like, oh, there's a store
720000	722000	Oh, there's better weapons
722000	724000	Why I'm not doing any damage to these people
724000	726000	So
726000	728000	It's been okay
728000	730000	It's kind of a lot of grinding
730000	732000	Because right now I'm just leveling up Cloud
732000	734000	But
734000	736000	I don't know, it's still fun
736000	738000	I wish I could understand some of the story that's going along
738000	740000	But to be honest, it doesn't
740000	742000	Really seem like I'm missing a whole lot
742000	744000	So, eh
744000	746000	And then
746000	748000	I went ahead and
748000	750000	Fired up my Playstation 3
750000	752000	I tried out Home
752000	754000	And
754000	756000	It's okay, I guess
756000	758000	I was kind of bored with it
758000	760000	I tried making a character look like myself
760000	762000	And then that didn't work, so the next best thing
762000	764000	Was I made a creepy Santa Claus
764000	766000	And I had to
766000	768000	You know, first I was just trying to find
768000	770000	Clothes that looked like the Santa Claus clothes
770000	772000	And then I realized that they actually sold the Santa Claus
772000	774000	Clothes, so I had to buy those
774000	776000	And so now
776000	778000	Wait, wait, wait, stop
778000	780000	Hold on, you bought something
780000	782000	In Home? Yeah
782000	784000	Get off the show
784000	786000	I am laughing you off
786000	788000	Of this program
788000	790000	You spent money on that
790000	792000	That's it
792000	794000	That's all I spent money on
794000	796000	But yeah, I didn't even end up buying the club
796000	798000	Remember how I talked about how I wanted to buy the OLR club
798000	800000	Well, turns out I could go in and buy it
800000	802000	And after I was reading more about it, I'm like, this sounds stupid
802000	804000	There's no point for it yet
804000	806000	But, you know
806000	808000	Basically I bought stuff on there
808000	810000	Just to see how easy it was
810000	812000	And it actually is pretty easy
812000	814000	The items are pretty cheap
814000	816000	At least the clothes were only like 50 cents each
816000	818000	And the thing about it is
818000	820000	I had knocked the PlayStation Network before
820000	822000	Because I hated the way you put money on your account
822000	824000	And you have to spend so much
824000	826000	Actually, I found out
826000	828000	If you have
828000	830000	If you are buying items that are under
830000	832000	$5
832000	834000	Then yes, you can only put in
834000	836000	The minimum of $5 on your account
836000	838000	If you're purchasing stuff over $5
838000	840000	In total
840000	842000	What will happen is
842000	844000	Say if you have less than $5 in credit left
844000	846000	It will only charge you
846000	848000	You can have the option just to
848000	850000	Import the exact amount into your account
850000	852000	Which is something I wish Microsoft
852000	854000	Would totally do with Xbox Live
854000	856000	Because that would be awesome
856000	858000	None of this
858000	860000	20 points just sitting there for no reason
860000	862000	You can actually just do the exact amount
862000	864000	Which is sweet
864000	866000	So yeah, I played around with home
866000	868000	For a little bit
868000	870000	And it was a complete waste of time
870000	872000	I don't get
872000	874000	What the purpose of all this is
874000	876000	But at least you look like Santa Claus
876000	878000	So hooray for that
878000	880000	Yes, at least I look like Santa Claus
880000	882000	Big deal
882000	884000	I'm going to still wear the Santa Claus costume forever
884000	886000	I'm not buying any more clothes
886000	888000	That's it, I'm Santa Claus forever now
888000	890000	Even in June
890000	892000	That's fun
892000	894000	So yeah, it was quite boring
894000	896000	And the loading is annoying
896000	898000	I gotta say
898000	900000	Some comments from chat because they're too good
900000	902000	Hanukkah Harry in chat says
902000	904000	What the fuck Loki, you might as well buy Eye of Judgment
904000	906000	No, I'm not buying Eye of Judgment
906000	908000	Trishlicious in chat says
908000	910000	I wish I had a Playstation 3 then I could be exploring home now
910000	912000	Honestly, Trish
912000	914000	I used to feel that same way
914000	916000	Like 6 months ago
916000	918000	You're not missing much, honestly
918000	920000	I think home is going to be a lot better in a year
920000	922000	But that'll be a year
922000	924000	I do have to give them credit though
924000	926000	The video integration in it
926000	928000	Like the actual little video screens and stuff
928000	930000	That's actually pretty cool
930000	932000	And it's pretty seamless
932000	934000	But at the same time it's kind of annoying
934000	936000	And it's also annoying how much
936000	938000	Stuff is being censored in there
938000	940000	Like everything is being censored
940000	942000	And it's really annoying
942000	944000	Ok, so enough with home
944000	946000	The other thing I downloaded on the Playstation Network this week
946000	948000	Was the new Metal Gear Solid pack
948000	950000	For LittleBigPlanet
950000	952000	And holy crap does that change the game
952000	954000	It really, first of all
954000	956000	The pack itself contains like
956000	958000	5 levels and I think a challenge level
958000	960000	And they're great levels
960000	962000	I mean it's the same kind of quality
962000	964000	As the in-game story levels
964000	966000	They're awesome
966000	968000	I like it though because the whole premise of the levels
968000	970000	Is that you're basically
970000	972000	Going to try to stop
972000	974000	Liquid's
974000	976000	Device for creating trophy levels
976000	978000	It's a machine that creates trophy levels
978000	980000	Genius, pure genius
980000	982000	I love the way that Media Molecule
982000	984000	Played on some of the current controversies
984000	986000	The only thing that would have been even better
986000	988000	Was a joke about moderation
988000	990000	Somehow
990000	992000	But I love that they actually made fun of the whole trophy whoring levels
992000	994000	That was great
994000	996000	But the actual
996000	998000	Like the new weapon, the paininator in it
998000	1000000	Awesome, it really
1000000	1002000	It's going to open it up to a whole bunch of new
1002000	1004000	Types of levels
1004000	1006000	Which is great
1006000	1008000	And from what I actually watched the podcast they did on
1008000	1010000	Kotaku
1010000	1012000	They were talking about what their plans are
1012000	1014000	For LittleBigPlanet and they were asked about LittleBigPlanet 2
1014000	1016000	And they said
1016000	1018000	They have no plans on making LittleBigPlanet 2
1018000	1020000	As long as they can keep adding to LittleBigPlanet 1
1020000	1022000	They're going to keep doing that
1022000	1024000	That's all they're working on
1024000	1026000	Unless they hit a roadblock
1026000	1028000	Unless they really want to add
1028000	1030000	That they can't do in LittleBigPlanet
1030000	1033560	But for right now, they're just going to keep doing download packs because they're selling
1033560	1035060	really well.
1035060	1036220	So that's kind of cool.
1036220	1041280	Now just to clarify though, you don't have to buy this Metal Gear Solid add-on to get
1041280	1044500	to use the Paintinator because it'll show up in other people's levels, right?
1044500	1045500	Yes, that's right.
1045500	1046500	That's kind of neat.
1046500	1050820	Yeah, but if you want to add it to your own levels, then you have to buy it.
1050820	1053140	Honestly, you should buy it anyways because it's awesome.
1053140	1057660	I actually bought the Metal Gear Solid pack to the little costumes because I had to dress
1057660	1061200	up like, I think, Raiden in there or something.
1061200	1062200	It's cool now.
1062200	1066420	So I'm doing that instead of my weird ninja cape guy.
1066420	1070340	But yeah, I was playing some more of the levels on there.
1070340	1072100	They're really cool.
1072100	1073100	The Paintinator's fun.
1073100	1077300	And just someone actually made a level that was like a tank that had three different weapons
1077300	1080380	and stuff on there and that was kind of neat.
1080380	1083860	And just some of the stuff that they do in the Metal Gear Solid levels are just amazing.
1083860	1088340	They actually have one level that you have to sneak and avoid these spotlights because
1088340	1093700	if not, then you die because all these explosions come.
1093700	1097700	And then just, you know, the last boss in the game, it's awesome.
1097700	1101580	It really is an awesome set of levels and I really hope they keep releasing stuff like
1101580	1105100	this because they're really cool.
1105100	1110700	And then, of course, you know, the usual stuff, you know, more Grand Theft Auto IV, both on
1110700	1119140	PC and on the 360 and yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.
1119140	1120140	Alright.
1120140	1124060	Arkadian42, Bradley Surd, the chatty one tonight.
1124060	1127540	I saw you haul a DS in here and you were kind of playing DS while we had a little bit of
1127540	1129460	downtime a little bit ago.
1129460	1131020	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
1131020	1134900	Alright, most of this week I was not playing anything because I was at home on the other
1134900	1137380	coast doing Christmas stuff.
1137380	1140220	But what I've been playing recently is My Japanese Coach.
1140220	1141220	Wait, wait.
1141220	1142220	Where is home?
1142220	1144220	Because we might have some listeners there that want to go, whoo!
1144220	1145220	Greenville, South Carolina.
1145220	1146220	Whoo!
1146220	1147220	Alright.
1147220	1148220	Long way away.
1148220	1149220	Yes.
1149220	1153940	In front of the airport yesterday because my first flight was overweight so it drove
1153940	1157220	five of us down to Atlanta for the second flight.
1157220	1158220	Oh wow.
1158220	1160220	Yeah, it was a fun time.
1160220	1161220	Interesting.
1161220	1165260	Yeah, they were carrying extra fuel because there was like fog or something in Atlanta
1165260	1170900	so just in case it couldn't land at the time and had to fly around for half an hour or
1170900	1171900	something.
1171900	1174580	So you got lots of DS time in during all this travel debacle.
1174580	1178940	Well, actually I was listening in because there was a British couple who lived in the
1178940	1184260	area and they were going back to England for a week for someone's funeral or something.
1184260	1187540	It was kind of fun to listen to them.
1187540	1189100	But anyway, the one I was playing...
1189100	1193420	Sorry, I told me to laugh but I'm just trying to picture what must have been so fascinating
1193420	1195580	about this conversation.
1195580	1196580	Never mind.
1196580	1197580	Another show.
1197580	1198580	My Japanese coach.
1198580	1199580	Okay.
1199580	1204260	Well, I'm basically reviewing what I've learned before for the most part and learning a little
1204260	1207260	bit enough to get through that.
1207260	1213340	And it's actually pretty good for learning new stuff and I think there's maybe the only
1213340	1218820	limitation if you're like a newer user would be or a newer person learning Japanese would
1218820	1224260	be that it kind of glosses a little bit over the learning sentences and so on, but it's
1224260	1227420	good on repetition of words and so on.
1227420	1233300	Which is if you're just reviewing the first 30 or 40 lessons, it's a little bit tedious
1233300	1238580	because it takes a while because you have to repeat games and stuff to get to the next
1238580	1239580	lesson.
1239580	1240780	Do you actually have to talk into it?
1240780	1243040	No, you don't have to talk.
1243040	1246020	There is a thing you can actually compare.
1246020	1249740	You can speak into the mic and then it'll repeat it back and you can kind of compare
1249740	1255080	it to actually the actual Japanese speaker that's in the game so that you can learn that
1255080	1256080	stuff.
1256080	1257080	That sounds neat.
1257080	1259940	Do you think somebody like me who doesn't know a lick of Japanese yet tries to pronounce
1259940	1262820	the Japanese release dates here on Orange Launch Radio and gets teased for it every
1262820	1266740	other week, do you think I might have some benefit to play this game?
1266740	1268380	Yeah, it would be pretty good.
1268380	1269380	I might have to check it out.
1269380	1273580	Yeah, and then you can learn the hiragana and katakana and of course it takes a long
1273580	1276780	time because it's not until less than 40 or something.
1276780	1280020	Although Jamie did admit a few weeks ago, I've gotten better in the years I've been
1280020	1281020	doing it.
1281020	1282020	You have gotten quite a bit better.
1282020	1284700	I've gotten better, so when in doubt, crash and burn your way through it.
1284700	1285700	Arigato.
1285700	1291820	Yeah, because basically when I've been listening to the podcast, trying to catch up, I'm still
1291820	1292820	like 30 behind.
1292820	1293820	I'm actually thinking about getting that, though.
1293820	1295740	Oh man, come on, you can say that better.
1295740	1296740	With the Japanese coach?
1296740	1297740	Yeah.
1297740	1298740	Yeah?
1298740	1301820	Because I have a couple of friends that live in Japan that I want to visit, but I also
1301820	1305660	have people I know in England that I want to visit, so I have to think.
1305660	1309380	See if I really wanted to learn Japanese, what I would do is get Jamie a device where
1309380	1313340	every time I mispronounce a word, she shocks me, but the problem is that she would use
1313340	1316780	that device for things other than its intended purpose, so I don't allow her to have this
1316780	1317780	device.
1317780	1319980	Hanukkah Harry said I was a scroll.
1319980	1321740	I'm not a scroll.
1321740	1323100	That probably finishes gaming week.
1323100	1329500	Okay, I'll go a little bit farther than this week because other than this, since it's been
1329500	1335020	a while since I've been here, the other things I've been playing is Castlevania Lament of
1335020	1339300	Innocence, which, even though I heard people saying it was bad or something, it's actually
1339300	1340700	a pretty good game.
1340700	1344360	Other than the camera issues, which you can't see half the time because it's looking in
1344360	1348660	the other direction from the actual degree of movement, it's actually pretty enjoyable
1348660	1356260	and the voice acting is really good, and the other thing was Zelda Phantom Hourglass, which
1356260	1361220	I've still got a ways to go, and that's a fun game.
1361220	1366100	Alright, reading some other comments in chatroom, Akuma JP says, commenting on my reading of
1366100	1369820	the Japanese release dates, Sky sometimes gets very good when he is in a good mood,
1369820	1374380	but no idea when he is not in the mood, so apparently if I'm in a good mood, I'll do
1374380	1378540	better at reading the release dates, so I'll try to smile before I read the dates tonight
1378540	1381340	so I'm in a good mood, although I don't think we have a lot this week.
1381340	1386740	Alright, my gaming week, real quickly, because pretty much everything I wanted to talk about
1386740	1389340	has already been talked about.
1389340	1392580	I have been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King, as you know, I'm addicted
1392580	1396860	to MMOs, but I would like to congratulate our guild for clearing Nax, that was pretty
1396860	1401220	awesome, which is one of the big raids at the end, we cleared 10-man Nax this week,
1401220	1407780	which is nice, and the other thing I've been playing is the Metal Gear Solid expansion
1407780	1412900	on LittleBigPlanet, which is amazing, and everybody should buy it, because not only
1412900	1416620	does it come with the whole gun and things you can put in your own levels, I don't even
1416620	1421180	design levels, but I just kind of wanted to see, my thought was, is that, hmm, probably
1421180	1426100	Media Molecule designed some levels to unlock this stuff in, because I heard that you actually
1426100	1429500	had to play these levels to unlock the stuff, so you're basically getting, you know what,
1429500	1433780	five or so new Media Molecule levels, and they are great!
1433780	1436920	And I realized I could go online and download a ton of other levels, but there's something
1436920	1441100	about having the official developer with official unlocks, being able to play those levels,
1441100	1443300	and they are fantastic.
1443300	1446900	Something Loki kind of neglected to mention is that not only can you run through them
1446900	1450620	once, but you can go back and you can play through these same levels again with new challenge
1450620	1453980	elements on them, you'll get stickers at the very end that you can go back and place at
1453980	1457300	the very beginning, and then suddenly the entire level becomes a race, which makes some
1457300	1460360	of those things like the stealth level and stuff become very interesting, because you're
1460360	1462100	trying to rush, but not too much.
1462100	1465520	I've actually gotten most of the trophies for the entire thing, in fact, I think I have
1465520	1469700	all the trophies except for the one beating the last boss under a certain time limit,
1469700	1471740	but I have all the other trophies, because I've gone through-
1471740	1473780	I don't think I've unlocked a single trophy yet, sadly.
1473780	1480240	Because I've gone through, I've aced all the levels, I've gotten every single bit of collectible
1480240	1483400	stuff in the game, or at least in those levels.
1483400	1486620	I'm missing like two stickers in one level that is bugging the hell out of me because
1486620	1487620	I can't figure out where they are.
1487620	1489100	I know what you're talking about, you're talking about the third level, and it took me-
1489100	1490100	Yes, it is!
1490100	1491100	How do you know?
1491100	1492800	Where are they?
1492800	1493800	You tell me now!
1493800	1494820	Alright, I'll tell you now.
1494820	1499340	You know that spot where you have to shoot the green thing so the platforms lower down?
1499340	1500340	Yeah.
1500340	1504180	On the second one that lowers down, you walk through to the left, and there's a hallway
1504180	1505180	that you can walk through.
1505180	1506180	Oh, shut up.
1506180	1507180	Really?
1507180	1508180	Yeah, it took me forever to figure that out.
1508180	1512220	That is so crazy, I didn't even have to tell you what it is that's frustrating me, and
1512220	1514740	I know exactly what you're talking about, I'm like, nope, I haven't been there.
1514740	1515740	You're right, that's what I'm missing.
1515740	1519420	Yeah, because I had to read the comments for the actual level, and there was questions
1519420	1523020	about that in there, and that's where they said it was.
1523020	1525860	I knew, just playing the level, I'm like, there's something down there, I just don't
1525860	1526860	know how to get down there.
1526860	1529980	The network was down the day I was trying to play, so I couldn't do that.
1529980	1530980	Interesting.
1530980	1534860	But I gotta say, honestly, if you have LittleBigPlanet, check out the expansion, you won't be disappointed.
1534860	1539300	Even if you don't build levels, I think the five or so levels that come with it are, it's
1539300	1540300	six bucks.
1540300	1541300	It's worth it.
1541300	1542300	It really is.
1542300	1546540	Okay, let's move on with tonight's show, and try to get into some gaming news.
1546540	1548560	But first, some housekeeping tonight.
1548560	1552540	First off, we want to make sure everybody had a really wonderful holiday, and just a
1552540	1556340	quick reminder, although we didn't take off any shows for the holiday, we will not be
1556340	1564580	here January 11th, I believe is the day, yeah, January 11th, we will not be here, so no yelling
1564580	1565820	at Bobby if he goes long.
1565820	1566820	January 11th.
1566820	1572300	He can go to midnight if he wants, I don't really care, so be nice.
1572300	1575460	But yeah, no, we're not going to be here January 11th at all.
1575460	1578660	And just out of curiosity, something else I want to ask during housekeeping tonight,
1578660	1581380	did you all get any gaming loot for Christmas?
1581380	1584160	I didn't really get anything, but did you guys get any gaming loot for Christmas?
1584160	1585540	I got two things from Dan.
1585540	1591380	Well, keep in mind, we bought each other new computers, so we easily spent a couple grand
1591380	1594140	on each, you know, together for our presents.
1594140	1600700	But he did get me the Animal Crossing Strategy Guide, so I know what all the Toto KK songs
1600700	1602460	are called now.
1602460	1609000	And he got me these Kingdom Hearts promo cards that they had at his store, and I kind of
1609000	1614180	wanted them, so he grabbed me some, and I got the Silent Hill Homecoming soundtrack,
1614180	1620460	which a lucky person is going to be receiving a copy as well, but I won't say anything more
1620460	1623460	than that.
1623460	1626180	Ooh.
1626180	1628980	And candy.
1628980	1631340	And I got a coat.
1631340	1632780	I have a funny story about my coat.
1632780	1634820	You remember the coat I was wearing last week?
1634820	1636860	Yes, I do.
1636860	1639740	Well, Becky and I were going shopping.
1639740	1640740	Did someone knock on the...
1640740	1641740	No.
1641740	1642740	No.
1642740	1646220	We were going shopping, and we saw these coats at this one retailer, who I will not
1646220	1649100	mention, and we thought they were cute, so we went in, and it was like marked down from
1649100	1653820	$89 to $39, and they were probably going to get one half price.
1653820	1657220	So we just gifted each other coats, and they were really cool.
1657220	1658220	Nice.
1658220	1659220	And super cute, but I'm not wearing it today.
1659220	1660220	Um...
1660220	1662220	Surprisingly, the studio's not nearly as cold as it has been in previous weeks.
1662220	1663220	Dude, it's not.
1663220	1665100	I was thinking I was going to freeze or some shit.
1665100	1666100	Yeah, it's been kind of nice.
1666100	1668940	I don't know what the difference is today, but I'm not going to complain.
1668940	1673540	And of course, I got a Ragnarok Online DS from Loki.
1673540	1675620	Aw, Loki.
1675620	1676620	You're the best.
1676620	1677620	Hey, no problem.
1677620	1678620	All right.
1678620	1679620	One other thing...
1679620	1680620	Oh.
1680620	1681620	Oh, yeah?
1681620	1682620	I got Knights on Wii.
1682620	1683620	Oh, how's that?
1683620	1684620	Haven't opened it yet.
1684620	1689200	I didn't get any games or anything, but Rama did send me this shirt that says Companion
1689200	1693740	Cube is my co-pilot, so thank you very much to Rama, who sent me that shirt, which I think
1693740	1694740	is great.
1694740	1695740	It's very cute.
1695740	1697380	This is something you cannot have.
1697380	1700780	And I'm being very scummy because I wore it yesterday, too, and I'm doing that really
1700780	1704300	gross thing where I wore the same shirt two days in a row because I was lazy today.
1704300	1707300	I didn't really leave the house, so whatevs.
1707300	1708300	Come on.
1708300	1709300	You've all been there, too.
1709300	1710560	Admit it.
1710560	1716300	I do want to work in a plug for Bobby because our listeners chased him off the air tonight,
1716300	1720740	so the least I can do is give him a plug for his new project, which is actually going to
1720740	1721740	be pretty awesome.
1721740	1723540	And if I was in Atlanta, I would go.
1723540	1725420	Sadly, I'm not.
1725420	1731380	Sadly I might be, and I would make it a point on Friday night to go check out fnglive.net.
1731380	1733940	It's a new program that starts January 9th.
1733940	1734940	That's the same weekend.
1734940	1738460	We're not going to be here, sadly, but it all starts January 9th, and they are taping
1738460	1743980	live at a computer arena in Atlanta, and there's going to be other people on, and they're going
1743980	1747780	to actually dissect game consoles and repair them live on air, and it's actually kind of
1747780	1748780	a multimedia thing.
1748780	1749780	It's not just a radio.
1749780	1752140	They're doing TV, too, so it sounds pretty exciting.
1752140	1753920	I just sent them my broken 360.
1753920	1754920	Good luck fixing that one.
1754920	1757460	Yeah, I think you have to take a number for that, because I think they already have lined
1757460	1759420	up what they're doing for the first two shows, but...
1759420	1760780	No, I don't want it back.
1760780	1761780	They can just...
1761780	1762780	They just have it?
1762780	1763780	Yeah.
1763780	1764780	I don't know.
1764780	1765780	Maybe they take it.
1765780	1766780	I don't know.
1766780	1767780	You'll have to talk to Bobby.
1767780	1768780	All right.
1768780	1769780	So check that out.
1769780	1772100	Again, fnglive.net, and they start January 9th right here on All Games Radio is where
1772100	1776300	you can hear the feed, so if you're not in Atlanta and you can't go check it out in person,
1776300	1779220	if you're in California, New York, Canada, wherever else you might be, you can check
1779220	1780940	it out on the internets.
1780940	1781940	Let's get into some gaming news.
1781940	1783380	Yes, we do have gaming news this week.
1783380	1784380	It's very odd.
1784380	1787900	We spend this week kind of reflecting on the year 2008, and we will do a little bit of
1787900	1789260	that later.
1789260	1794500	However, we need to talk about some news, because there's actually been some big news
1794500	1795500	this week.
1795500	1799580	Yeah, unfortunately it's not for our region, though, but Japan...
1799580	1800580	What happens in Japan?
1800580	1801580	Might happen here, right?
1801580	1802580	Still more.
1802580	1804340	Yeah, not so much, I don't think.
1804340	1808900	Basically, you know, Japan, they do a lot of things over there, especially with their
1808900	1814420	WiiWare service and Nintendo and that kind of stuff, that we will probably never see
1814420	1815900	over here.
1815900	1819940	For example, you know, they got a while back a...
1819940	1825740	I don't know if it was a couple WiiWare downloads, but they have a new, like, manga comics that
1825740	1829700	you can actually download on the service, which is kind of neat.
1829700	1834020	Plus, you know, they had their Nintendo channel for a while before we did.
1834020	1837700	Well, they're getting another channel, and it's not too surprising, since the other two
1837700	1839920	consoles also have one similar.
1839920	1845700	It's a new video streaming service that will be available.
1845700	1859660	Now, this is actually in conjunction with Densetsu, and it's basically not your typical,
1859660	1864300	you know, video download service, because they're not going to have movies, they're
1864300	1866920	not going to really have a lot of TV shows and stuff.
1866920	1867920	What they're going to have, though, is...
1867920	1868920	Oh my God!
1868920	1870380	Is it what I've always been waiting for?
1870380	1871620	A porno on-demand service?
1871620	1873660	No, it's not a porno on-demand service.
1873660	1877040	It's actually going to be some...
1877040	1881140	They're going to have Nintendo videos on there, whatever that's supposed to be.
1881140	1884500	I don't know if that's, like, the old Nintendo cartoons, you know, like the old Donkey Kong
1884500	1890660	stuff, and, you know, stuff like that, maybe Captain N. You know, one can hope.
1890660	1891660	And they're going to also have...
1891660	1892660	Oh God, no.
1892660	1893660	They're going to have...
1893660	1895260	Endless loops of Nintendo breakfast cereal commercials.
1895260	1899300	Basically, kind of think of, like, you know, family programming.
1899300	1901720	You know, stuff you'd see on Saturday mornings, that type of stuff.
1901720	1903380	That's what they're going to have on there.
1903380	1907500	Now, I don't know if it's actually going to have downloads as well.
1907500	1912340	It says some downloads will require payments, while others will be free.
1912340	1915700	There's that humming that one of the mics is causing, I don't know which one.
1915700	1916700	Is it?
1916700	1917700	Yeah, here.
1917700	1918700	It's a very...
1918700	1919700	That's a very naughty microphone.
1919700	1920700	Sorry, guys.
1920700	1921700	Anyway.
1921700	1922700	Live radio.
1922700	1923700	Hi.
1923700	1926980	Yeah, it's going to be coming early next year.
1926980	1933180	No prices have been announced yet, but interesting, though, that they're going to be bringing
1933180	1934180	this out.
1934180	1937740	Maybe this is something that's coming to the US.
1937740	1938740	I don't know how this...
1938740	1945220	To be honest, if you've ever used the web browser in this, you know, the bandwidth to
1945220	1950700	the Wii seems very, very slow, so can you imagine actually downloading content with
1950700	1951700	the Wii?
1951700	1952940	You know, like actual videos and stuff?
1952940	1954980	I think it would take forever.
1954980	1958820	We kind of need that upgrade that's supposed to get our SD cards, which wasn't that supposed
1958820	1960540	to be out before the end of the year?
1960540	1961540	Right.
1961540	1962980	That won't be coming out until...
1962980	1967260	You'll probably have to buy a game that'll unlock that or some shit.
1967260	1970620	Hitstun in chat says, Sky, porno on demand service equals the internet.
1970620	1971620	Ooh, touche.
1971620	1974620	But I can't really get that on my TV very easily.
1974620	1980220	I can use the internet channel or the PS3's internet thingy, I know, but they suck.
1980220	1981220	They're clunky.
1981220	1982220	But it works with...
1982220	1984500	If you're using YouTube on the Wii, it's not that good.
1984500	1985860	But you can do porno, too.
1985860	1987820	We did that one time, actually, at a bar.
1987820	1988820	It was clunky.
1988820	1990860	Yeah, that was actually last New Year's, wasn't it?
1990860	1992740	Or two years ago, maybe?
1992740	1993740	Yeah, I don't know.
1993740	1994740	Yeah.
1994740	1995740	Anyway, sorry.
1995740	1996820	I don't watch porn!
1996820	1997820	That's sick!
1997820	2000980	Remember the donkey punch video that they had?
2000980	2001980	It was...
2001980	2002980	Shut up!
2002980	2004820	It was literally a guy dressed as a donkey.
2004820	2005820	Shut up, monkey!
2005820	2006820	That was hilarious.
2006820	2008100	We didn't do that.
2008100	2009100	Literal puns are funny.
2009100	2011100	No, we prayed, remember?
2011100	2012420	Cheese.
2012420	2016860	Oh, Lord, please let them do a sequel to this video.
2016860	2017860	Amen.
2017860	2019140	And pterodactyl porn.
2019140	2020140	Hey!
2020140	2023100	Food Delivery Channel is coming to Japan, as well.
2023100	2024100	That's right.
2024100	2028440	If you want to get food delivered to you, you can now do that through your Wii.
2028440	2032020	It's called the Damae Channel, the Food Delivery Channel.
2032020	2034380	8,500 different restaurants.
2034380	2036840	Apparently you are going to be able to browse it by genre.
2036840	2042340	Like pizza, bento boxes, sushi, curry, Chinese, whatever.
2042340	2046700	You apparently can go on here, and the restaurants will actually estimate what the delivery time
2046700	2047700	is.
2047700	2051460	You place the order on the Wii, it's faxed to the restaurant, and then it's kind of like
2051460	2053060	ordering it on the internet.
2053060	2055780	And I was kind of like, this has got to be bullshit.
2055780	2058700	But apparently, there are screenshots and everything.
2058700	2061860	And granted, this stuff can be photoshopped, but I don't know why someone would want to
2061860	2065520	waste that colossal amount of time on a stupid prank on Christmas.
2065520	2068580	So this looks to be the real deal.
2068580	2069580	I guess so.
2069580	2070580	I don't know.
2070580	2071580	But this looks to be pretty authentic.
2071580	2075780	And which is strange, because people predicted that this might happen a long time ago.
2075780	2077780	Well, I suppose people predicted everything.
2077780	2080580	But yeah, you look at this here, and there's even a screenshot here where somebody can
2080580	2083420	click on like Pizza Hut and order pizza.
2083420	2084420	Interesting.
2084420	2089380	I don't know, if they did something like this in the US, do you think?
2089380	2093860	Man, Pizza Hut is talk about like a whore for like ordering stuff.
2093860	2098900	I mean, before they were in like EverQuest, you know, now they're in this business.
2098900	2104100	I would love to have a Pizza Hut here with the Japanese menu.
2104100	2110340	No, seriously, I was seeing one of the people I keep up with lived over there and posted
2110340	2112500	a picture of the order menu.
2112500	2114300	There's some very funky pizzas.
2114300	2117860	It's like something out of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or California Pizza Kitchen.
2117860	2119820	Or John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
2119820	2120820	No.
2120820	2121820	OK.
2121820	2126220	Um, yeah, the thing is, though, I don't think a channel like that would work here because
2126220	2132540	we're not so, we're so spread out here in the US, whereas in Japan, there's a lot more
2132540	2133540	kind of, you know what I mean?
2133540	2137860	Like, I don't think, it might work in different cities, it might work in different, like,
2137860	2141740	it might, they might be able to do that for New York City for, well, I don't even know
2141740	2144100	if you could do it in Los Angeles and make it worth it.
2144100	2145100	I don't know.
2145100	2147620	But then you say, you talk about how Pizza Hut whores themselves in every game.
2147620	2148860	Well, that's just good business though, right?
2148860	2152820	They can get one extra order a day out of it, it's worth it, right?
2152820	2157740	But the thing in, I don't know, it's just like, I just don't see myself firing up the
2157740	2162940	Wii to order a pizza when, I don't know, I could use the phone like everybody else.
2162940	2166860	You can do internet ordering on a lot of these places' sites, too.
2166860	2167860	That's very true.
2167860	2171780	AcidicVampire in chat says, Pizza Hut equals Kaka Hut.
2171780	2174020	Actually, that's probably one of the pizzas you can get in Japan.
2174020	2176220	You know what, though?
2176220	2179100	And I'll tell you, their pasta is pretty good.
2179100	2182740	I actually thought about getting some of that, but the thing, the tray of pasta that they
2182740	2186420	give you is huge, and that would just look ridiculous if I'm eating a huge tray of pasta
2186420	2187420	here.
2187420	2188420	Goodness, we don't have the camera anymore.
2188420	2190180	Yeah, we don't have the camera.
2190180	2191980	You could bring an entire cake.
2191980	2192980	But still, though, I wouldn't.
2192980	2195260	You could bring an entire cake and eat it on here.
2195260	2196420	I don't like that much cake.
2196420	2200340	I'll just say, fatty's eating cake again.
2200340	2202060	I don't like cake.
2202060	2209100	Now I did want to make a meatball sub, though, and for some reason I saw on the Food Network
2209100	2211820	they had this thing where they were making it over to someone's kitchen, and that's what
2211820	2213340	they decided to make is a meatball sub.
2213340	2214340	Like, damn, it looks good!
2214340	2217860	And all of a sudden, you know, I got a craving for a meatball sub.
2217860	2223660	This is the Pizza Hut menu in Japan as of June, and I want you to tell me if this sounds
2223660	2225060	tasty to you.
2225060	2231780	There's bacon mushroom, barbecue chicken, carbonara, which is bacon, egg spread, and
2231780	2232940	black pepper.
2232940	2234700	Without the egg spread, yes.
2234700	2236220	Cheese and cheese.
2236220	2237220	Sure.
2237220	2238860	Yes and yes.
2238860	2245140	Crab and shrimp mayo king, which is five shrimp, fake crab, corn, onion, broccoli, and mayonnaise.
2245140	2247060	I need the listeners to understand this.
2247060	2248340	I fucking hate mayonnaise.
2248340	2253120	Don't you ever give me anything with mayonnaise even remotely near it, because mayonnaise
2253120	2254580	will ruin anything for me.
2254580	2256580	I hate, hate, hate mayonnaise.
2256580	2261660	I hate warm mayonnaise, because warm mayonnaise, like mayonnaise on burgers, awful.
2261660	2262660	On sandwiches?
2262660	2263660	Okay.
2263660	2264660	Well, these are great.
2264660	2267660	Okay, the deluxe is pepperoni, salami, bacon, and green peppers, blah, blah, blah.
2267660	2268660	Yes, yes and yes.
2268660	2270260	Gomodari pork, I'd actually eat that.
2270260	2275920	It's a burdock root mix, sesame sauce, pork, shredded seaweed, and sesame sauce.
2275920	2281980	The Idaho special is diced potatoes, bacon, onions, corn, parsley, black pepper, and mayonnaise.
2281980	2283380	That sounds awesome, except for the mayonnaise part.
2283380	2286380	There's one called the mayo queue, if you can guess what that is.
2286380	2288460	It's barbecue with mayonnaise.
2288460	2294780	Meat paradise, pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.
2294780	2295780	Loki?
2295780	2296780	Does that sound good to you?
2296780	2297780	What?
2297780	2298780	I think we need to go to Japan.
2298780	2299780	When?
2299780	2300780	What was it?
2300780	2301780	It's called the meat paradise.
2301780	2302780	And?
2302780	2305780	It's pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.
2305780	2309700	That's just, that's just like, they have it already over here.
2309700	2313980	It's like the Monty's all meat marvel, and the...
2313980	2315760	Loki connoisseur of meat.
2315760	2318920	They used to have beef on their pizzas, but they don't do it anymore, because apparently
2318920	2323100	not that many people like beef, and it kind of went bad because no one ate it.
2323100	2324100	I want to have a pizza.
2324100	2329140	Here's a Sicilian style pizza with tuna mushrooms and meat sauce.
2329140	2333800	We could do a meat pizza, like a round table over here, because they have like multiple
2333800	2340060	varieties of like, you know, different pepperonis and different, you know, sausages, and they
2340060	2345060	have, I think they have chicken too, and ham, and God, we could just pile that shit up.
2345060	2348220	I remember someone that used to order like a quad sausage pizza.
2348220	2349980	That'd be four times the amount of sausage.
2349980	2355500	I kid you not, it was like a giant patty on top of the entire pizza.
2355500	2357500	It's like, what is wrong with you people?
2357500	2359940	Here, Rob, this one's for you.
2359940	2362000	Mochi mentai and potato.
2362000	2364660	Large shrimp diced potatoes, Korean mochi.
2364660	2367900	Corn, onion, mayonnaise, we'll ask for it without.
2367900	2370580	Shredded seaweed and fish roe sauce.
2370580	2371580	Mochi?
2371580	2377540	Or there's a seafood mix, which is large shrimp, squid, tuna, and mayonnaise, broccoli, and
2377540	2378540	onion.
2378540	2380900	Who puts, I want to know who puts corn on a pizza.
2380900	2384220	All the rest of it I could make, but corn is fucking disgusting.
2384220	2385220	I've seen it.
2385220	2386740	And then again, I'm also allergic to corn.
2386740	2388940	Better yet, who puts mayonnaise on a pizza?
2388940	2393380	I think they put mayonnaise on everything in Japan.
2393380	2394380	So I can't go to Japan.
2394380	2395540	Here we go, the last one on here.
2395540	2396860	I'd die of starvation.
2396860	2403500	Tartar chicken nanban, nanban chicken, red peppers, parsley, tartar sauce, and nanban
2403500	2404500	sauce.
2404500	2409060	As long as nanban doesn't mean like asshole juice, I'll be fine.
2409060	2410740	It's basically Portuguese style chicken.
2410740	2412100	Okay, that's fine.
2412100	2413100	Like what is that?
2413100	2416860	That could, when you're talking about a chicken, it could be anything.
2416860	2420940	All right, anyhow.
2420940	2424900	Some of this is just like, I would actually eat it though, because some of the stuff I'd
2424900	2430660	order something similar, and really the cheese and cheese is like a margarita, the margarita
2430660	2431660	pizza.
2431660	2432660	Oh yeah.
2432660	2437620	But I actually would order some of this stuff, because I have a CPK, but still.
2437620	2441220	Okay, I ordered- How did this turn into Orange Lounge Fudio,
2441220	2442940	going on like 15 minutes now?
2442940	2446740	Because, this is why I want them to deliver Japanese style pizza.
2446740	2449300	And poor Bobby got chased off the air for this?
2449300	2450300	Yes he did.
2450300	2451300	Nanban chicken?
2451300	2457020	Well, if he was talking about pizza, we would have been fine with that.
2457020	2458940	Note to Bobby, your show needs more meat.
2458940	2459940	All right.
2459940	2461340	You need meat paradise!
2461340	2462940	All right, stop picking on Bobby.
2462940	2463940	All right.
2463940	2468620	Dark Sakura, what else is going on in gaming news?
2468620	2473620	Well, there is this plumber named Mario who lives near a pizza place!
2473620	2475540	No, I'm kidding.
2475540	2481780	Basically it's something to be coming out for the virtual console in Japan is Super
2481780	2483220	Smash Brothers.
2483220	2486780	Like the Nintendo 64 one, dun dun dun.
2486780	2489180	It will be there in January.
2489180	2499380	So it's going to be out there for 1200 points, but there's no real say as to when we'll probably
2499380	2504700	get it out here or so, but that means we probably will be getting it since we tend to get some
2504700	2512100	of the stuff that, you know, if it was a release, Yawn and Hither, then it would definitely
2512100	2516380	be duplicated over here, I would think.
2516380	2519540	So there, Rob.
2519540	2520540	That sounds nice.
2520540	2522580	I guess I would download that.
2522580	2523580	What?
2523580	2524580	Meat paradise.
2524580	2529540	Looking at some comments in chat, Giovedea in chat says, I have had a taco pizza with
2529540	2530540	corn on it.
2530540	2531540	It was really tasty.
2531540	2535500	I was trying to, it's just pizza chat.
2535500	2536500	I didn't see anything about video games.
2536500	2537860	I think it should have scampi pizzas.
2537860	2540380	Except, oh, AcidicVampire asks a good question.
2540380	2542940	Will Super Smash Brothers 64 have online play?
2542940	2543940	You wish.
2543940	2544940	No.
2544940	2545940	You wish.
2545940	2549340	Did the Nintendo 64 version have online play?
2549340	2554300	But in Pokemon Snap, they added the feature where you can save the snaps to your Wii message
2554300	2555300	board.
2555300	2556300	So?
2556300	2559100	So it shows they can enhance the games if they really want to.
2559100	2560100	So?
2560100	2561380	And they don't want to.
2561380	2565860	It makes you wonder, doesn't it make you wonder if maybe Pokemon Snap at one point had some
2565860	2572780	type of feature to save those pictures in some type of more exportable format that they
2572780	2576800	just, like the game maybe originally was going to let you, I don't know, save them to some
2576800	2581980	type of computer or something, and now they turned it into this thing instead?
2581980	2585860	Because that's the only game that has had anything special happen to it.
2585860	2589700	When yet you would think a game like this, they would just try to add online play.
2589700	2591660	But try for us.
2591660	2592660	No.
2592660	2599700	They don't want to try because this is the same company that is releasing GameCube games
2599700	2600940	that you can now play on your Wii.
2600940	2601940	Oh, wait a second!
2601940	2605220	You can still play those GameCube games on your Wii already!
2605220	2607460	It just doesn't have stupid motion controls.
2607460	2608460	And guess what?
2608460	2611460	They're cheaper.
2611460	2614220	Chat dot orange launch radio dot com if you want to chat with us.
2614220	2615220	Aha!
2615220	2616420	That's exactly the type of thing I was looking for.
2616420	2617420	Game Guru in chat.
2617420	2618980	See, this is why I love having a live chat room.
2618980	2624420	Because Pokemon Snap had a feature to download them to Blockbuster and print them out.
2624420	2627940	So it's not, they didn't even really, really enhance it that much.
2627940	2632700	They took a feature that everybody forgot about, including yours truly, and just changed
2632700	2634700	it slightly.
2634700	2636100	It's an altered enhancement.
2636100	2638980	Wasn't that a Sega Genesis game?
2638980	2639980	Alright, forget it.
2639980	2642140	How about some release dates, Loki?
2642140	2644140	Altered enhancement?
2644140	2648940	Well, um, yeah.
2648940	2652500	There's, uh, nothing coming out.
2652500	2653500	At all.
2653500	2654500	Nothing?
2654500	2655500	Not a damn thing?
2655500	2656500	Not a damn thing.
2656500	2657500	Alright.
2657500	2658500	Wow.
2658500	2662860	I mean, I had this, uh, not a good time of year for, um, you know, most companies are
2662860	2666300	closed and, yeah, not a thing.
2666300	2668300	Not even, like, Imagine?
2668300	2673980	No, uh, the Spore, the Spore comic book creator, I think, was the only thing, and that's not
2673980	2676540	even technically a game, so.
2676540	2680860	Well, I wish I could tell you it looked much different in Japan, but it actually does not
2680860	2684340	look like we have a lot of releases this week either in Japan.
2684340	2689700	Um, looking very quickly to see, even if there's anything on Wii, no, it's going to be a very
2689700	2690820	slow month in Japan.
2690820	2694020	There's very few games coming out even in the first couple weeks of January over in
2694020	2695020	Japan.
2695020	2701500	Um, no, the DS, geez, even the DS titles don't start rolling in until the 15th, but hey,
2701500	2706080	you could pre-order The Happening, which comes out on January 9th on the Sony PSP, but otherwise
2706080	2710020	there is absolutely nothing coming out in Japan this week.
2710020	2711020	Well.
2711020	2713540	How about the UK?
2713540	2719820	I can't really say that there's a whole bunch coming out in the UK, because, um, first of
2719820	2728500	all, my list isn't showing 2009, so that's, uh, actually kind of disturbing.
2728500	2731340	We'll just assume nothing of notice coming out there as well.
2731340	2732940	Some stuff.
2732940	2735380	Yeah, really, not a lot.
2735380	2737020	Well, so much for release dates.
2737020	2738740	Wah wah, you lose.
2738740	2739740	Rob.
2739740	2740740	What?
2740740	2741740	We've had a call for more pizza.
2741740	2742740	More pizza?
2742740	2744100	I can't, I can't even think about more pizza.
2744100	2745100	I already ate.
2745100	2748420	Didn't they have, like, a peanut butter and jelly pizza or something, that John's Incredible
2748420	2749420	Crappy Pizza?
2749420	2751620	Um, I don't think so.
2751620	2752620	I don't, well, they might.
2752620	2753620	I don't know.
2753620	2756060	I just know, I remember the ones that are, like, different and crazy are the macaroni
2756060	2757380	and cheese pizza and the, uh,
2757380	2759220	Are very awful.
2759220	2763420	That peanut butter one that had the actual peanuts on it, which I thought was strange.
2763420	2765500	That was actually pretty good, but it was spicy.
2765500	2766500	Yeah, it was very spicy.
2766500	2773260	So, I, I, I do have to, though, share a little bit of, um, what, um, is on menus in Japan
2773260	2774260	for, um, McDonald's.
2774260	2776660	Alright, why not, since we didn't have release dates?
2776660	2777660	Let's go back to food.
2777660	2778660	Filet of shrimp.
2778660	2779660	Okay.
2779660	2780660	Yeah.
2780660	2788660	Um, then there's the Mega Mac, which, imagine a Big Mac with two more patties.
2788660	2790300	Yum.
2790300	2794300	And then, um, there's an Ebi, that's, that's the same one, that's the shrimp.
2794300	2798260	And then the Thousand, the Shrimp Thousand Island Wrap.
2798260	2801460	You know when I go to, uh, Hawaii in two weeks, you know what I have to get?
2801460	2802460	Hmm?
2802460	2803460	A McDonald's?
2803460	2804460	What?
2804460	2805460	Spamburger.
2805460	2806460	Oh my God, aren't those good?
2806460	2807620	I like Spam musubi.
2807620	2809780	And the, uh, teriyaki pineapple thingy.
2809780	2810780	They do, right?
2810780	2817500	And, um, they also have McPork and, um, the teriyaki McBurger.
2817500	2819260	So there's more food from around the world.
2819260	2821300	We do have gaming news at some point, right?
2821300	2822300	Yes, we do.
2822300	2824380	I'm looking at Burger King.
2824380	2826860	Um, yes.
2826860	2835440	Like the merger of Spam and Shrimp and hamburgers, um, we have yet another game company merger
2835440	2838900	about to happen with Tecmo and Koei.
2838900	2844740	They have plans to, um, I guess merge in about two months.
2844740	2852460	And, um, you know, I guess after rejecting Square Enix's, uh, attempt to take over Tecmo,
2852460	2860860	they've decided to merge with Koei to release the most ultimate booby bouncing action game
2860860	2866020	ever set in Fuel Japan, because that's the only thing I could see possibly coming from
2866020	2868260	this sort of merger.
2868260	2870940	Booby pizza?
2870940	2881220	But apparently, um, that they've announced, um, oh, this is actually very old news apparently
2881220	2884160	and I don't understand how this slipped in.
2884160	2885160	My bad.
2885160	2890820	Apparently this already happened, like, a long time ago.
2890820	2892340	I don't know how this guy makes it in there.
2892340	2893340	It's not the news.
2893340	2894340	It's the old.
2894340	2896340	It is really old.
2896340	2901020	So I'm like, look at this, it's all, has announced on September 17th, I'm like, what
2901020	2902020	the fuck?
2902020	2904220	And it's all September 18th.
2904220	2906820	You know when I was putting this together tonight, I was kind of like, I thought that
2906820	2908820	already happened, but I didn't really, you know, I was just so annoyed.
2908820	2909820	My bad.
2909820	2910820	But that's weird, though.
2910820	2913580	Okay, just wait until you say, and see, we were just recapping what happened this year.
2913580	2917060	Yes, we're totally recapping.
2917060	2918060	Fuck this shit.
2918060	2919060	You know what?
2919060	2921860	I don't care if they merger, because you know what, they're still going to put out fucking
2921860	2924360	Dynasty Warriors games out the ass.
2924360	2926460	By the way, Dynasty Warriors, Six Empires comes out February.
2926460	2927460	You know what?
2927460	2928460	Fuck the show.
2928460	2929460	Let's go get pizza.
2929460	2930460	Really?
2930460	2936420	The sad thing is, I'm half serious.
2936420	2940700	If there was a way we could somehow, like, just take the camera and go out on the road
2940700	2944340	and take it with us to get pizza, I would totally do it.
2944340	2945620	I would say yes.
2945620	2947860	I would say, the hell with the show, pizza.
2947860	2949020	Anyway, sorry.
2949020	2951000	We can't do that, Rob.
2951000	2952000	We love our people.
2952000	2953180	I know, we do love our people.
2953180	2957220	Whatever, I give up, you know.
2957220	2958860	I don't know how I went back that far.
2958860	2962820	All right, well look, I have something that I promise is current, because just in time
2962820	2965740	for the holidays, Konami sued someone.
2965740	2966740	That's right.
2966740	2970740	Konami loves to sue people over music games, and this week, who did Konami sue?
2970740	2973100	Pentavision, the makers of DJ Max.
2973100	2975060	That's right.
2975060	2980300	They have claimed patent infringement, Konami has, and intellectual property rights infringement.
2980300	2983800	This was Konami of Korea that actually did it, because they're, you know, filing this
2983800	2986100	lawsuit against a Korean company.
2986100	2989100	They filed it in the Seoul Central District Court in Korea.
2989100	2990580	They want to get damages.
2990580	2995020	They want to stop Pentavision from selling the offending products, quote unquote, which
2995020	3002460	of course has unleashed the outcries of not fair, unfair, Konami sues everybody and everything,
3002460	3007660	and Konami, you suck, and da da da da da, and all this stuff, but I don't know.
3007660	3008860	How do you guys feel about this?
3008860	3011140	I mean, I don't know how many of you have played DJ Max.
3011140	3012620	I've definitely seen the game played.
3012620	3016580	I have a friend who's obsessed with it, and made it a point to show me, you know, DJ Max,
3016580	3019980	and wanted to show me what the game was all about, and, you know, I did look at it and
3019980	3026620	go, wow, this really looks like Beatmania.
3026620	3030980	I mean, granted, I realize it's played with buttons, it's not exactly the same, but the
3030980	3037300	look and feel was kind of the same, I'm sorry to say, you know, but I don't know.
3037300	3041900	Do the people that say, hey, Konami just sues everything, is there a point here, what?
3041900	3043100	What do you guys think?
3043100	3048980	I'm really not surprised in the least, so I'm just going to roll my eyes and go next.
3048980	3055300	I am surprised because I thought, you know, and I could be very wrong about this, but
3055300	3061900	I thought that Pentavision, actually the company that makes DJ Max, came out of the company
3061900	3068540	that made EZ2DJ, since most of the artists in DJ Max are from EZ2DJ.
3068540	3073900	I would find that as a very big coincidence if that was not the case, but I would figure
3073900	3078580	that it's more of a ripoff of EZ2DJ, and who cares?
3078580	3086260	To be honest, I thought EZ2DJ was better than Beatmania anyways, so, whatever, and they're
3086260	3090160	going to go ahead and sue them, probably because they're planning on making some crappy music
3090160	3096420	game for the PSP or something, because, you know, Konami's on the latest and greatest
3096420	3098140	trends for music games.
3098140	3100300	Oh wait, no, they're not anymore.
3100300	3103940	They're way behind everything.
3103940	3107700	So Hanukkah Harry in chat says, is all a trap set up by Konami.
3107700	3111500	By not releasing quality versions of Guitar Freak, Strummania, and Beatmania in the US,
3111500	3114420	they are setting up other companies to come out with copies of them.
3114420	3117760	Konami then sues them and gets a piece of the action without lifting a finger, except
3117760	3119760	to call their lawyers.
3119760	3124020	You know, as much as that makes sense, I don't think that's it.
3124020	3127660	I don't think Konami in their minds thinks they're not doing a good enough job.
3127660	3131780	I think Konami thinks Rock Revolution is a quality product.
3131780	3136820	I think there are people at Konami, probably Konami Japan, that think that that is what
3136820	3139260	people want.
3139260	3145180	The Guitar Hero and Rock Band are the sub-par games.
3145180	3151340	Rock Revolution is a wonderful game, and these other games are infringing on the rightful
3151340	3153820	heir to the music game throne, which is Rock Revolution.
3153820	3161700	The problem now is that they wanted to make a music game, and they're worried about fridging
3161700	3165940	on other people's patents, and now, unfortunately, since they came out with a drum that's totally
3165940	3170780	different than what Drummania had, the best thing they could do is come out with what
3170780	3173900	they did for Drummania, basically, and bring it over here.
3173900	3180540	And at the time, it was kind of neat as a drum game, but things have gotten a lot better
3180540	3185540	since then, and they can't come out with something that looks similar because they will get sued
3185540	3190100	by the other companies, and there'll be kind of a 180 for them.
3190100	3193700	Hanaka Harry wants to clarify, he was mostly joking with the comment, but I have seen that
3193700	3197820	comment for real reals and different threads around the internet about this.
3197820	3201900	And if you think I'm wrong in what I'm saying about that Konami of Japan is seriously disillusioned
3201900	3206420	to their fan base, all you need to do is look at Beat and Groovy and Rock Revolution, because
3206420	3208860	these are the products Konami is continuing to put out.
3208860	3212340	Yeah, but see, I think in Japan, though, they're actually putting out some good games over
3212340	3213340	there.
3213340	3218460	Like, if you look, for example, at the new Dance Dance Revolution, what would be the
3218460	3222080	equivalent of Hoz Party 2 over there on the Wii, it's actually a lot better than it is
3222080	3223080	over here.
3223080	3227460	Like, they have different types of music and stuff like that, which obviously applies to
3227460	3229780	more of the people that play the Wii over there.
3229780	3236580	And then you also have Juby and stuff like that, which look pretty good.
3236580	3241820	But I don't know, I don't think necessarily, I think they don't really know what their
3241820	3247480	audience is anymore, and that's pretty sad.
3247480	3252700	But at the same time, they can't honestly look at Rock Revolution as a success, because
3252700	3253700	it's not.
3253700	3256740	I mean, look at how fast that thing price dropped.
3256740	3259420	Look at the sales for it, I mean, I think they speak for themselves.
3259420	3264140	It was a waste of effort on their part, and it wasn't much of an effort to begin with,
3264140	3268300	so you get what you put into it, I guess.
3268300	3274220	Here's my thought, and tell me if I'm off-base with this one, but I believe that if you're
3274220	3279220	pissed off about this, whether you're a fan of DJ Max, or a fan of music games who is
3279220	3284340	getting a little frustrated at Konami's putting out sub-par music games and then trying to
3284340	3288740	take out these other guys, I think now's the time for you to take five minutes of your
3288740	3292600	life to sit down and write an angry letter.
3292600	3297600	And I don't mean an unprofessional letter, I mean an angry, concerned, person who spends
3297600	3300240	money on Konami, letter.
3300240	3305820	And I think you need to send them a letter and tell them exactly what you think.
3305820	3311000	And don't use profanity, don't use words that you wouldn't say in front of your mother,
3311000	3315540	but you need to tell them that you know what, that you find it's very wrong, that they would
3315540	3319420	continue to sue these companies over-enteringing on the products when they are not putting
3319420	3323420	out Beat Media games in the US, and that you really want to see, if they're going to stop
3323420	3327080	these other products from coming out, that you want to see a new Beat Media game be released
3327080	3328080	in the US.
3328080	3329080	But here's the problem.
3329080	3330080	What?
3330080	3332460	They're suing them in Korea because these games are coming out in Korea.
3332460	3334820	It's not anything to do with the US version.
3334820	3337180	People are just figuring that because of that...
3337180	3340940	Wait, wait, wait, but you don't think the US version had nothing to do with this?
3340940	3341940	Yes, I don't.
3341940	3343260	I think you're wrong.
3343260	3347420	Because these Korean versions have been out for a while now, but isn't it funny?
3347420	3351480	When did they sue the people that made In the Groove when the home version was announced?
3351480	3355540	When are they suing the people that made the Penn Division thing when the US DJ Max was
3355540	3357660	on its way out?
3357660	3360660	There's a correlation there.
3360660	3362500	I'm convinced that...
3362500	3365860	I understand this is all going down in Korean court of law, but it's still an international
3365860	3373060	company who has much bigger interests in the US and Japan.
3373060	3374420	So I don't know.
3374420	3378780	Dark Sakura, sometimes you like to give your input on these types of protests and business
3378780	3379780	stories.
3379780	3383500	What do you think would be the best thing for a person to do who's ticked off?
3383500	3387780	Honestly, it's going to be send in your letters.
3387780	3388780	Buy stock.
3388780	3389780	Shit.
3389780	3391700	What did we say before?
3391700	3397600	Buy stock in the company, then you have a right to be heard as a shareholder.
3397600	3400340	But don't post an angry thing on the internet.
3400340	3404100	Post petition online, because you know what that's going to do?
3404100	3405100	Nothing.
3405100	3406100	Absolutely nothing.
3406100	3410100	The only type of petition that's going to have any real swing is if you get your signatures,
3410100	3414420	make a copy, and send it to Konami.
3414420	3420060	Because then the people that are advocating for you at Konami, of which there have been
3420060	3422160	some, look at Jason Enos.
3422160	3424040	Would you have ever had DDR in the US without him?
3424040	3425820	Don't think so.
3425820	3430300	The people that are advocating for you there have something to take back to Japan and say,
3430300	3434940	look, you are out of touch.
3434940	3436940	Just saying.
3436940	3441700	Anyhow, more gaming news, things going on in the gaming world.
3441700	3443620	Dark Sakura?
3443620	3444940	Let me see.
3444940	3452120	Oh, just a little game that a few people were playing and then it went, um, started going
3452120	3454460	poop.
3454460	3456720	Tabula Rasa.
3456720	3465260	So NCSoft is saying that Tabula Rasa is free to play and will be free to play until the
3465260	3471300	28th of February, 2009, when they take down the servers.
3471300	3478180	So you can actually get a serial code from the support website and download the client
3478180	3480460	and you can play.
3480460	3486080	So it will ask you for your credit card number, but they're not going to charge you for shit.
3486080	3490580	So enjoy it while it lasts.
3490580	3493360	That's just weird that they want your credit card number even though they're not actually
3493360	3494360	going to charge you.
3494360	3496020	Doesn't that seem a little weird?
3496020	3498900	I think it's just because it's how the site's set up to do.
3498900	3500220	I guess.
3500220	3503740	But I bet there's a lot of people to get a little, maybe, maybe they want to make sure
3503740	3507540	that they are like actual people and not like spam bots or something.
3507540	3508540	Maybe.
3508540	3509540	I don't know.
3509540	3510540	That makes sense, but I don't see why they would care.
3510540	3511540	Yeah, true.
3511540	3512540	I mean, then again, it is their, their bandwidth.
3512540	3514060	So true.
3514060	3517900	Maybe it's a way to kind of like, even though it's free, it's like squelched a little bit
3517900	3520340	so that only people who really want to do it, do it.
3520340	3521340	I don't know.
3521340	3522940	It could possibly be.
3522940	3523940	Who knows?
3523940	3525060	I mean, hey, free.
3525060	3526900	Anybody here think they might check it out?
3526900	3527900	No.
3527900	3528900	Nope.
3528900	3529900	I might.
3529900	3530900	I might.
3530900	3533500	I feel like I want to know what I'm missing.
3533500	3536240	But it's kind of weird that they're doing this because what if suddenly people find
3536240	3537460	that they really like this game?
3537460	3540740	Well then that gives them incentive to put it back to P2P.
3540740	3541740	I guess.
3541740	3542740	We'll see.
3542740	3543740	Moving on.
3543740	3548420	Well, another virtual world that's doing pretty well right now is Home, and apparently they've
3548420	3553580	had quite a boost for pay-for-content sales.
3553580	3557060	And yes, unfortunately I did contribute a little bit to that.
3557060	3559100	I'm so glad you said it so I didn't have to.
3559100	3563020	Hey, it's just a little bit okay.
3563020	3569860	But I guess during, in the first four days of the open beta, Home produced more money
3569860	3575100	for Sony than the video download service did in its first week.
3575100	3577220	I'm not surprised.
3577220	3584100	And I guess the biggest sellers are the ridiculously priced Santa outfits.
3584100	3585500	Huh.
3585500	3587180	Oops.
3587180	3596060	And yeah, they basically said it's a classic 80-20 model.
3596060	3604540	20% of your consumers create 80% of your income, but there is a lot of stuff that you can purchase
3604540	3605540	in it.
3605540	3608260	I mean, they're going to be adding more to it.
3608260	3612980	Honestly, other than purchasing that Santa outfit, I don't think I'm going to be buying
3612980	3613980	anything else on this.
3613980	3617480	And to be honest, I don't think I'm going to be wasting much time on Home anyways unless
3617480	3620100	they really do something that's worthwhile.
3620100	3621100	Because I tried playing one of the...
3621100	3622880	Make your trophy room.
3622880	3623880	Not even the trophy room.
3623880	3628060	I mean, I tried playing one of the little UFO shooter games or something that was in
3628060	3630100	there, and the whole thing crashed.
3630100	3631100	Which was awesome.
3631100	3632100	Nice.
3632100	3633660	So I'm like, nope, I'm not wasting my time on this.
3633660	3635720	The Ecochrome one's not bad.
3635720	3637820	Is it just the Ecochrome demo, or?
3637820	3638820	Um, kinda.
3638820	3641580	It's like a little Ecochrome minigame.
3641580	3644300	It's worth checking out.
3644300	3645300	You know what's interesting though?
3645300	3648900	They don't say, like, what was available on the store in the first week in the video store.
3648900	3652880	Like maybe it's making not a fair comparison here, because maybe the video store had very
3652880	3654260	slim pickings the first week.
3654260	3656140	So it was like all old stuff.
3656140	3657140	I mean, I don't know.
3657140	3660020	I don't remember, because I didn't have a PS3 back then.
3660020	3661020	I don't remember.
3661020	3665540	I didn't use the video service, so I don't know.
3665540	3666740	Some people are excited about Home though.
3666740	3670740	We have Trishlicious in chat says, uh, gotta save some cash and get a PS3 for Home.
3670740	3671740	I want to make content.
3671740	3675780	Uh, AcidicVampire says, there are Ecochrome cults in Home.
3675780	3676780	Seriously.
3676780	3678140	I wouldn't be surprised.
3678140	3680060	Ecochrome's kinda neat.
3680060	3681060	It's different.
3681060	3683420	Very different kind of game.
3683420	3687500	Also talking about something else with Home, talking about some of the words that have
3687500	3691180	been censored in Home, apparently it actually got picked up by the San Francisco Chronicle.
3691180	3694740	The San Francisco Chronicle is writing a story about PlayStation Home, and it's kind of what
3694740	3699420	makes it notable, because it was focusing the article on this gentleman, Michael Marsh,
3699420	3702500	and he was actually trying to set up a gay straight alliance club in Home.
3702500	3705180	He's a straight guy who's a supporter of gay rights.
3705180	3710940	However, he found that the words gay and bisexual were not allowed in Sony's virtual world.
3710940	3717020	Meaning that there were a lot of kind of words to be discovered that were not able to be
3717020	3723500	used in Home, including hell, Christ, Jew, which by the way means all derivatives of
3723500	3725740	those words cannot be used either.
3725740	3731580	So you cannot say, hello, because it has hell in it.
3731580	3735940	I'm not lying.
3735940	3740900	And the San Francisco Chronicle ran a quote from this guy who was trying to set up the
3740900	3745340	club, who I think sums up the way a lot of people are thinking, quote, I can understand
3745340	3750100	that they're filtering out profanity, but it feels like it's discrimination.
3750100	3754460	By blocking a word like gay, which is a preferred term by the gay community, you're encouraging
3754460	3756260	it as a bad word.
3756260	3761620	A city vampire in chat says gay is allowed now, so who knows, maybe Sony made a hot fix
3761620	3763220	because of this news.
3763220	3766500	Why don't people just get over it?
3766500	3767500	The end.
3767500	3769700	Get over it.
3769700	3772940	My whole thing is that, you know, and somebody had posted this in a showreel thread saying
3772940	3774900	this is probably a story that would piss me off.
3774900	3775900	It kind of doesn't.
3775900	3777800	I think it's more silly than anything else.
3777800	3781260	It makes me think back on like, remember Phantasy Star Online?
3781260	3783820	Like there were a bunch of words that you couldn't say because they had other words
3783820	3784820	in them.
3784820	3788160	Like I can't remember what some of the words were, but there were like normal everyday
3788160	3789160	words you could say.
3789160	3790580	Saturday because you can't say turd.
3790580	3794900	Yeah, you can't say Saturday and things like that.
3794900	3797220	It just reminds me of this.
3797220	3798220	It's the same thing.
3798220	3801020	Honestly, I don't know, it's not that big a deal to me.
3801020	3802660	At least it's consistent.
3802660	3803660	I don't know.
3803660	3804660	But here's my thing.
3804660	3806620	I don't think they should censor words at all.
3806620	3809060	I think that people, because people will get around it.
3809060	3810060	Exactly.
3810060	3812420	Like Tiger Claw says they can spell it as H3LLO.
3812420	3813420	How about this?
3813420	3815900	Have an option where you can turn it on or off.
3815900	3817020	Oh my god!
3817020	3818020	Look at that!
3818020	3822140	You can censor stuff or you can, you know, not censor stuff and maybe you can even have
3822140	3825740	parental controls because everybody likes parental controls.
3825740	3827420	Why can't services like this...
3827420	3829340	Okay, here's my suggestion.
3829340	3831480	Services like this should have a button.
3831480	3836580	If I press that button on a user, then it should send the last 20 things that user has
3836580	3840420	said to Sony so Sony can review it and decide if this person should be allowed to be in
3840420	3842100	home anymore or not.
3842100	3845560	If I'm abusing this, then I should have the button taken away from me.
3845560	3847060	How hard is this?
3847060	3848660	How hard would this system be?
3848660	3852760	And then I think you should be able to say fucking shit and cock and gay and fag and
3852760	3854660	all that stuff as much as you want.
3854660	3860340	You can say any of it, just as long as you're, you know, not saying it to children or people
3860340	3862900	that are, you know, are not your friends and should not be hearing it.
3862900	3864620	Does that make sense?
3864620	3867980	Or in your own little room apartment thing.
3867980	3868980	Yeah.
3868980	3870700	That's a little weird.
3870700	3872940	Frisbee says don't spend the money on home or Second Life.
3872940	3873940	Spend it on real life.
3873940	3878700	Well, home is free, to be fair, but I don't know.
3878700	3884380	I, you know, for me it was, I think, I can't remember how many pieces it took to make this
3884380	3890340	Santa outfit, but it was like $2.50 and yeah, that's probably $2.50 more than I should have
3890340	3895060	spent it on home, you know, but it's $2.50 and I was like, whatever, you know, I buy
3895060	3900620	these stupid $5, $10 games from live and who cares?
3900620	3901620	It's $2.50.
3901620	3905620	SSJ100 Matt says in chat, asshole juice?
3905620	3907140	Definitely banned.
3907140	3909140	Definitely banned.
3909140	3912700	GS68 says sophomore would be banned.
3912700	3917540	It has homo in it, S-O-P-H-O-M-O-R-E.
3917540	3919180	Probably another word that's banned in home.
3919180	3920180	I don't know.
3920180	3923300	You know, at least, at least it's consistent, but I don't know.
3923300	3927700	Just I think this is a case of a few bad apples ruined the barrel for everyone and there's
3927700	3931520	people that don't know how to use these words in proper context and because of these assholes,
3931520	3935740	the rest of us have to pay the price of this hypersensitivity and hair trigger of which
3935740	3938340	we've seen Sony use before.
3938340	3948140	So, to these people who are just abusing with, you know, free speech and what is given to
3948140	3951460	them, we dedicate the FUs of the week to you.
3951460	3972660	FU to Dalmore for being in Korea.
3972660	3978700	I want to order eyeballs and wigs from that site and they're in Korea, so $20 pair of
3978700	3985700	eyes, cost me $45 after EMS shipping, it's like a bunch of dad.
3985700	3986700	Loki!
3986700	3995580	FU to my need to buy yet another airsoft gun because I, you know, I bought a shotgun actually
3995580	3997860	that's pretty cool.
3997860	4001940	I thought it shot three rounds at once, but it doesn't, which is disappointing, but you
4001940	4006160	can fire it pretty fast, which is cool.
4006160	4013100	But I have this urge to have another AEG gun, and I really shouldn't buy another one.
4013100	4015100	Arcade EM42, do you have any FUs of the week?
4015100	4019980	FUs of the never-ending clutter in my apartment, which I never get around to.
4019980	4026820	Hopefully I'll get the time off I have this week from one of my jobs is off, so get something
4026820	4027820	every day, hopefully.
4027820	4029980	I can actually clean the damn thing.
4029980	4033020	You know, I think some of your clutter spilled over into the garage here somehow, I think
4033020	4036100	you might have.
4036100	4039460	I would like to say a big FU to the year 2008.
4039460	4040460	Good riddance.
4040460	4041460	I hate you.
4041460	4042460	Goodbye.
4042460	4044880	You are the weakest link.
4044880	4046380	That's it.
4046380	4049420	Let's get back into some gaming news now that we've gotten that angst off our chest.
4049420	4051340	Do you feel better, Rob?
4051340	4052340	Much.
4052340	4054580	Well, how about Braid?
4054580	4056980	I like to braid my hair now that it's long enough.
4056980	4057980	Haha.
4057980	4058980	Haha.
4058980	4064140	But seriously, Braid, the game that came out for Xbox Live Arcade, is going to be out on
4064140	4068780	the PC between February and March 2009.
4068780	4073980	So they don't know if it's, they actually are also thinking that there's going to be
4073980	4080380	a Mac version 2, which would be cool, and no word yet if there's going to be a version
4080380	4081380	for PS3.
4081380	4082380	All right.
4082380	4083380	Hm.
4083380	4084380	Hm.
4084380	4085380	Speaking of PS3.
4085380	4088500	So there's games on the Mac, huh?
4088500	4089500	A few.
4089500	4098380	Speaking of the PS3, Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 2 is just released, and there is a
4098380	4102900	problem with the game, unfortunately, that apparently a bunch of users are reporting
4102900	4107140	that there is a glitch that renders their save files completely useless.
4107140	4112300	Selecting a corrupted save file will freeze the gamers on a permanent loading screen.
4112300	4116700	And apparently this is a, you know, something that's going to be patched soon, however,
4116700	4121620	because of the holidays, Sony's QA department is taking a little break.
4121620	4128180	So that means that the patch will not be available until after the new year, sometime in January.
4128180	4130460	That sucks.
4130460	4133020	Huh.
4133020	4136180	This seems like the type of thing that Penny Arcade would have done a comic about.
4136180	4138620	Is it just me?
4138620	4140740	But somehow I don't think there will actually be one.
4140740	4144340	Hey, speaking of patches, this has been a long awaited one.
4144340	4149300	Castle Crashers apparently is finally getting its patch.
4149300	4152140	That's only about four months late.
4152140	4154100	The patch, I believe, went up this week.
4154100	4158060	I think it actually was scheduled to go up on Christmas Day.
4158060	4159820	No, Christmas Eve.
4159820	4161420	I think it went up finally.
4161420	4167420	So hey, you should go back and play some Castle Crashers, because now you can online anyway.
4167420	4169060	So there you go.
4169060	4176060	Apparently some extra things were thrown in as well, though, not just some fixes to the
4176060	4181380	game, but apparently I think they did some other little, like, new things, like weapons
4181380	4184140	and stuff like that, and two new characters.
4184140	4186180	The king is one of them, and so on.
4186180	4187180	And a chainsaw?
4187180	4188180	Do I see a chainsaw?
4188180	4189180	Yes, there is a new weapon, the chainsaw.
4189180	4190180	Sweet!
4190180	4191180	There you go.
4191180	4193420	I'll have to play that now.
4193420	4197740	So check that out if you, that's one of those titles I didn't pay money for, because everybody
4197740	4199580	told me you really couldn't play it online.
4199580	4201020	But maybe I'll go back and check it out now.
4201020	4204780	But I still think, my gut tells me they'll put it on sale in three months' time, so I
4204780	4206260	don't know, I might try to hold out.
4206260	4207980	Game guru in chat says, Castle Crashers?
4207980	4208980	What's that?
4208980	4209980	Who cares about that anymore?
4209980	4213260	A Twitch acidic vampire says, I like Castle Crashers.
4213260	4214260	Cry.
4214260	4218620	Anyway, let's move on.
4218620	4219620	Moving forward...
4219620	4227740	Oh, I'm sorry, I completely blanked.
4227740	4231060	How about the Gizmondo?
4231060	4232220	Do we remember this thing?
4232220	4233220	How about it?
4233220	4237340	Well, they are, once again, rescheduling the launch of the Gizmondo.
4237340	4240060	They haven't given up.
4240060	4246500	The quote says it's due to the economic climate in the US, as well as the rest of the world.
4246500	4252460	Maybe it might have something to do with your product being crap.
4252460	4260300	At any rate, they were deciding to turn the Gizmondo into a smartphone with a 3D graphics
4260300	4263020	chip and an open platform.
4263020	4268740	So basically, they're just trying to make another gaming taco.
4268740	4269740	But open platform?
4269740	4277500	Yeah, they actually wanted to have an open source app store for the Apple store compatibility.
4277500	4280340	Oh, now that's kind of nice.
4280340	4281340	I like that.
4281340	4282820	I like open.
4282820	4287100	And they wanted to make the price point $99.
4287100	4288580	So maybe...
4288580	4291540	Still wouldn't buy it.
4291540	4292540	You know what?
4292540	4298400	I bet you anything that Duke Nukem Forever will be on it.
4298400	4301900	You know what's funny, though, is that it's funny they want to go that route, but I probably
4301900	4305420	wouldn't buy one just because of the fact that I have an iPhone, and so I can have the
4305420	4307700	open stuff already.
4307700	4309540	I can get almost anything on my iPhone.
4309540	4312900	They're going to have to show me something I can get on their system that I cannot get
4312900	4314300	on my phone.
4314300	4318380	Lots of delays and revisions before the product's even released.
4318380	4319380	That's what you can get with the Gizmondo.
4319380	4323260	You know, I've got to say, though, I know you're not a big fan of the iPhones, Loki,
4323260	4330000	but I've got to say, it is pretty impressive that I can have movies that I like and music
4330000	4338440	and games and apps on my phone in my pocket everywhere I go.
4338440	4343740	And you get a wonderful data plan that goes along with that that's really expensive.
4343740	4345480	Congratulations.
4345480	4347140	It's worth it, honestly.
4347140	4348440	It's not worth it.
4348440	4351500	One thing people forget, in my opinion, it's worth it.
4351500	4361180	And well, like with my iPhone, for me and Dan, our overall cost went up by $10 only
4361180	4367460	once we, you know, adjusted some stuff we were being overcharged for before, but still,
4367460	4368460	I like it.
4368460	4369460	I got katamari now.
4369460	4374260	Uh, GS68 says, I have an iPod touch, thereby bypassing the phone plan thingy.
4374260	4377580	Rama says, yeah, but Sky, my phone, does the same thing, and I don't have to pay an extra
4377580	4378580	fee for it.
4378580	4379580	There you go.
4379580	4380580	Diverse opinions.
4380580	4384100	No thanks, I will never own an Apple product.
4384100	4385100	Never ever.
4385100	4389860	I don't care if Nintendo had a fucking orgy with Apple and their next product is like
4389860	4395160	super awesome virtual reality that pleasures me, I will not buy this fucking system if
4395160	4396160	it's Apple.
4396160	4397160	I'm sorry.
4397160	4400380	I will never ever own anything.
4400380	4405980	If they make a pacemaker that's the only pacemaker on the face of the planet that will save my
4405980	4411460	life, I will say let me die before I even take that thing.
4411460	4412460	Seriously.
4412460	4415900	Never ever will I fall victim to them.
4415900	4419300	Please somebody record this part of the show just in case, because you know there's going
4419300	4424780	to be that day where Apple puts out bacon or something that Loki is going to have it,
4424780	4428940	and we all have to remind him of this moment and say, told you so.
4428940	4434740	Alright, anyways, apparently there is a new guitar here coming out.
4434740	4435740	Shock!
4435740	4436740	Is there a guitar hero?
4436740	4437740	Really?
4437740	4438740	That they would do that?
4438740	4443260	Well this one's on the DS, yes I know, it's surprising, you know, what, three releases
4443260	4445700	in a matter of months?
4445700	4453140	But there is a new DS game coming out, it was actually found out through a description
4453140	4459500	on the ESRB website, yes, Guitar Hero Modern Hits will be coming out and they've already
4459500	4463180	figured out what three of the songs are going to be based on, this short description that
4463180	4469540	was talking about, you know, possible offensive lyrics, well the three songs that are pretty
4469540	4475300	much confirmed to be in the game, Sum 41's Still Waiting, Franz Ferdinand's The Fallen,
4475300	4481260	and Paralyzer by Finger Eleven, and no word on when Modern Hits will be out, but you can
4481260	4485380	better believe that there will be a ton more releases next year for Guitar Hero, both on
4485380	4488620	the DS and probably on the rest of it.
4488620	4493700	Is the DSi going to screw this all up, because, you know, it's going to be a different system,
4493700	4496420	so will that expansion thing have problems or what?
4496420	4499980	Here's the way I look at it, I don't think so because there's so many million DS systems
4499980	4507580	out there already that, you know, big deal, there just will not be another version, or
4507580	4513060	it will just not be compatible with, you know, the DSi.
4513060	4515540	You think there will be several versions, or what?
4515540	4519900	Well I just don't think that they'll put out a version for the DSi, or maybe the DSi gets
4519900	4529600	drums or something stupid like that, I mean, honestly, they could maybe make a new peripheral
4529600	4536380	for the DSi that would plug into the SD card slot, just a thought, you know, maybe a DSi
4536380	4540960	only version or something like that.
4540960	4543820	I don't think it's going to be an issue though, because like I said, there's so many systems
4543820	4545820	out there right now for the DS.
4545820	4549900	I'm actually kind of surprised that they're even releasing the DSi anytime soon in the
4549900	4556500	US, because they're still selling tons and tons and tons of DSes, I mean, I would wait
4556500	4563540	until it slows down before they release the DSi, and I think that they are going to probably
4563540	4569980	release the DSi soon, just to try to get people to buy another DS, just like they did with
4569980	4571380	the Game Boy Advance.
4571380	4576860	Never forget how many times you bought the Game Boy Advance, or the Game Boy.
4576860	4578260	How many times did they release it?
4578260	4584460	You know, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Player, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy
4584460	4585460	HD.
4585460	4586460	Alright, we get it, we get it.
4586460	4587460	Yeah.
4587460	4591780	Alright, hey, another lawsuit going on in the Nintendo world, and it's Nintendo's getting
4591780	4597580	sued over their DS Lite Charger, and it's because of a fire that happened in January
4597580	4599460	of 2007 in Kentucky.
4599460	4603700	Apparently the victims were compensated by the insurance company, as usually happens
4603700	4604700	those types of things.
4604700	4611540	The insurance company, though, filed a complaint against Nintendo now in the US District Court,
4611540	4616460	saying quote, the DS was defective in design, manufacture, and or because it failed to warn
4616460	4618680	consumers of dangers associated with it.
4618680	4622580	Due to defects existing within the product, which caused a risk of overheating and fire,
4622580	4625340	the product was recalled by Nintendo.
4625340	4629700	So what makes this notable, in my opinion, is that you can't blame this on some crazy
4629700	4633420	asshole, but now it's some crazy asshole's insurance company, no I'm just teasing, but
4633420	4637860	you know, it's an insurance company suing Nintendo now.
4637860	4641380	What do you guys think, hearing that this is coming from an actual other company, and
4641380	4645660	this is Liberty Mutual, it's not some little podunk insurance company, is suing Nintendo
4645660	4646660	over the charger.
4646660	4651020	Do you think it's going to be a valid thing, do you think people are too sue happy?
4651020	4652520	Any thoughts?
4652520	4658140	I think that they forgot how hot the DS really is.
4658140	4660140	So hot that it catches fire.
4660140	4667500	Well, if it's a liability issue, and they haven't put in any type of significant warning
4667500	4673380	that is negligence on the part of Nintendo, so yeah, it's a legitimate suit.
4673380	4675860	I don't see any problem with it.
4675860	4676860	Alright.
4676860	4683820	Let's see, GS68 in chat says, I think everybody is trying to kill Nintendo with lawsuit-y
4683820	4684820	death.
4684820	4686900	You know who should sue Nintendo?
4686900	4687900	Kami.
4687900	4690380	Then the circle will be complete.
4690380	4694860	It's the circle of lawsuits.
4694860	4695860	Forget it.
4695860	4700400	Hey, every week here on Orange Launch Radio, we like to highlight a game from the past.
4700400	4705260	We like to kind of dig into the archives of gaming history and choose one game to highlight
4705260	4711780	here on the program as the classic video game of the week.
4711780	4715460	So let's travel through the halls of gaming history with Dark Soccer right now and hold
4715460	4720700	her hand as she guides us to a game that you all should be checking out immediately.
4720700	4725260	Rob put me to sleep with his...
4725260	4726260	Shut up.
4726260	4728260	Read the game.
4728260	4732460	The game is Sonic Adventure.
4732460	4735980	And I picked the best music ever.
4735980	4737100	We want music, Rob.
4737100	4738100	It's going to take a minute.
4738100	4739100	Better not.
4739100	4743100	We just have to play some of this.
4743100	4751700	The, what is it, Speed Highway?
4751700	4752700	Yep.
4752700	4753700	Yep.
4753700	4766660	I had to pick the Speed Highway music because that's honestly so much my favorite level
4766660	4771180	of the game except for playing as Knuckles and then I like going through the Red Mountain
4771180	4773180	with Knuckles.
4773180	4779700	But anyways, Sonic Adventure, this is the game that made me buy my, that made me import
4779700	4784980	my Dreamcast because I wanted to play this that badly.
4784980	4795000	And so it came out actually on December 23rd, 1998 in Japan.
4795000	4800920	And it was the first game in the Sonic Adventure series.
4800920	4810700	It actually came out in America, the very final version, as Sonic Adventure International
4810700	4816480	on September 9th, 1999 which was of course the Dreamcast launch date in America.
4816480	4824440	I was in line, on September 14th, 1999 it came out in Europe and a little bit later
4824440	4827980	that in Belgium and December 3rd in Australia.
4827980	4833060	I just had to say that because I wanted to mention Belgium and Luxembourg.
4833060	4839660	So moving forward, this is, I'm not going to say that it's the first Sonic game in 3D
4839660	4844100	because, do you remember Sonic Jam?
4844100	4845100	Was that the one on the Genesis?
4845100	4850660	No, Sonic Jam was the Saturn release of all the Genesis and Game Gear and whatever versions.
4850660	4851660	Oh right.
4851660	4856140	And it had a middle level that was all 3D, it had different missions and stuff.
4856140	4862140	There's also Sonic 3D Blast was another one.
4862140	4869140	And the bonus stages were?
4869140	4874020	They were, they were in, yeah I guess they were in 3D-ish, weren't they?
4874020	4876020	Sonic 2's bonus stage was 3D.
4876020	4879060	Yeah, they went to a 3D box.
4879060	4883780	At any rate, you've got, you basically have your set levels and you play through certain
4883780	4884780	characters.
4884780	4888300	Of course you've got Sonic, who is the main guy.
4888300	4894620	You have Miles Tails Prower, which I think is cool.
4894620	4900700	You've got Knuckles the Echidna, and I really, really, really, really would only ever play
4900700	4905380	this game in Japanese because one of my favorite voice actors was Knuckles' voice actor, the
4905380	4909380	video I never watched, Shubushi Yuki, was possibly, and he was really cool.
4909380	4915260	He also was the boss, so it was like, I knew that voice!
4915260	4919180	There's also Amy Rose, who beats shit with a hammer.
4919180	4926220	There's Big the Cat, who fishes, and oh my god, I got turned into a fishy fishy fishy.
4926220	4932220	There's E-102 Gamma, which is the robot, and you can play as Super Sonic once you've finished
4932220	4933220	the game.
4933220	4937780	And of course he's all gone all super sci-aging or whatever.
4937780	4950140	You've also got Eggman for your bad guys, Chaos, who is a very weird little chao.
4950140	4955940	You've got Tikal, who is another chicken kid who keeps showing up, Zero, which is another
4955940	4960140	robot, and the little...
4960140	4966060	I'm saying chao because I played it in Japanese first, so that's how they said it.
4966060	4972500	But they're so cool, because who remembers the VMU, right?
4972500	4979700	You can actually download a virtual pet, the A-Life system, and you can play chao adventure
4979700	4982700	on your VMU.
4982700	4986780	For people who played this on the GameCube, you would actually play it on your Game Boy
4986780	4987780	Advance.
4987780	4992820	And so you can raise your stats, and you actually can go into your little chao house level or
4992820	4997380	whatever and play with them and see what they look like and feed them coconuts and do all
4997380	5000340	kinds of bizarre crap with them.
5000340	5009380	Some of the other robots are in Gamma's story, which are the E-series robots.
5009380	5012220	Also Knights is in the game.
5012220	5020340	Knights is, if you're going into the Casinopolis stage, there's actually a pinball area that's
5020340	5025380	based on knights, and when you go through the little special tunnel, you're flying through
5025380	5031300	a knights level, which is pretty cool.
5031300	5034500	So it's basically...
5034500	5040780	There's some, I guess, degree of RPG element to it, in fact it's just that it really has
5040780	5046700	an in-depth story, and you find different things to advance your plot, and you just
5046700	5050780	keep moving through it, but you've got your action stages and you've got your adventure
5050780	5054060	levels, which is where I'm saying the RPG part of it comes into.
5054060	5062820	And actually, for anyone who didn't know, the working title of this was Sonic RPG, and
5062820	5066540	they were pretty good together.
5066540	5071900	It's really fun, it's got a fantastic story to it, we actually, when we used our VCR,
5071900	5073900	recorded a lot of playing.
5073900	5084500	And actually, this game received a 38 out of 40 from Famitsu, and it's really, I don't
5084500	5091580	think that they've been able to touch this since this one came out.
5091580	5098340	Sonic Avenger 2 was okay, but this one just had everything, I mean from the sound effects
5098340	5105540	when you get your bubbles or your shoes, and the ending music being the same when you step
5105540	5111980	on the platform, being the ones that you release your little forest buddies out of, you know?
5111980	5117380	It's just really, really awesome.
5117380	5118860	See?
5118860	5121100	That music?
5121100	5129580	You know, all of your, it's just got the feel, you know, when you break open the robot creatures
5129580	5134620	and little animals pop out of them, like in, you know, the old ones, it just had all those
5134620	5137460	touches to it, it was fantastic.
5137460	5144740	So Sonic Adventure is definitely, definitely the game to get.
5144740	5145740	Looks like fun.
5145740	5149300	I think I played it once, and it moved very fast.
5149300	5152420	It's hard to follow for me, but I'm going to give it another go.
5152420	5158740	Another thing though, for people who actually like to get different collections, Sonic Adventure
5158740	5167040	DX Director's Cut is an enhanced version of it, and it has a mini-game collection where
5167040	5172380	you actually can get 12 different Game Gear games.
5172380	5178140	So you get Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Drift, Sonic Chaos, Sonic Labyrinth, Sonic the Hedgehog
5178140	5182300	2, Sonic Spinball, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, which is another version of Puyo
5182300	5188260	Puyo, Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic Drift 2, Tails Sky Patrol, Sonic Blast, and Tails the
5188260	5189260	Enter.
5189260	5190260	Done.
5190260	5191260	Get it?
5191260	5197100	All right, check it out, Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast, and didn't they remake this
5197100	5199260	game, put it out again, like on the GameCube or something?
5199260	5200260	That's what I was saying.
5200260	5201260	Oh yeah.
5201260	5202260	Talking about the GameCube version.
5202260	5203260	There you go.
5203260	5206140	Okay, there you have it, your classic game of the week, and we'll have another one next
5206140	5207140	week for you guys.
5207140	5210220	In the meantime, we're going to take a break, and when we come back, we have a little bit
5210220	5212700	of news in Part B, but mostly you guys.
5212700	5219020	We're going to be doing the mailbag and some quick calls tonight, and we also want you
5219020	5221200	guys to do this during tonight's break.
5221200	5226580	We're going to be putting together the Orange Lounge Radio Top 3 Games of 2008.
5226580	5231340	So if you want to participate, all you need to do is send in your votes right now, your
5231340	5236700	top 1, 2, and 3 game of 2008 using any criteria you want, and I'll compile it all together
5236700	5242020	during the break, and we'll have ourselves a list that myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and
5242020	5244780	maybe Brad, even though he said he didn't play anything this year, maybe we can get
5244780	5249460	him to think of three games, and we're going to do that, as well as a list list later tonight.
5249460	5251540	So go ahead and send me those games, and we'll tally it up.
5251540	5255020	Make sure you label it, though, 1, 2, and 3, and don't send me other private messages
5255020	5258100	because they'll get lost amongst the other tabulation.
5258100	5267860	So we'll do that, and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5267860	5272780	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this December 28th of 2008 for the
5272780	5276920	307th episode of our show, the last show of 2008.
5276920	5281900	As we get ready to move into 2009, if you can believe it, our seventh year of broadcasting.
5281900	5286300	I almost said podcasting, but that's not true because we didn't start podcasting until,
5286300	5288660	well, podcasting was actually around.
5288660	5292460	So anyhow, we got more news to get into, just a little bit, but then we're going to get
5292460	5297540	into some year-end wrap-ups and talk about our favorite games of 2008, as well as the
5297540	5299300	biggest stories of the year.
5299300	5300740	Lots and lots to talk about.
5300740	5303140	Let's kick it off with a little bit more news from this week, though.
5303140	5306940	It was a surprisingly busy week, considering it was a holiday and everything, but stuff
5306940	5308580	going on, right, Loki?
5308580	5309580	Yes.
5309580	5317020	According to CNET, it looks like Microsoft is wanting to add to the user experience and
5317020	5323580	design for the Zune group, and they're going to focus now on the Zune user interface, a
5323580	5332020	Zune PC application used to access the Zune Marketplace, and the Zune Xbox application.
5332020	5334980	What exactly is this application?
5334980	5335980	Who knows?
5335980	5342500	We've already seen a couple things being demonstrated before in the past.
5342500	5345140	Live Anywhere comes to mind.
5345140	5347900	Perhaps that's going to be integrated into the Zune.
5347900	5350140	Maybe you'll get to see when your friends are online, whether they're playing that kind
5350140	5351740	of stuff.
5351740	5355460	Possibly even XNA games, because I know that was something that was shown off.
5355460	5357220	I'm not sure if that's been implemented yet.
5357220	5358860	That would be pretty awesome.
5358860	5362540	So some of those.
5362540	5365780	Very interesting, and who knows?
5365780	5370740	I wouldn't doubt seeing that there may be a music download service coming at some point.
5370740	5376180	Since they do have the Zune Marketplace and it does happen to take Microsoft points, why
5376180	5384140	not integrate that into Xbox Live and maybe allow users to be able to, say, sync the music
5384140	5388740	that they have on their Zune with their 360, vice versa, because it's all tied with your
5388740	5389740	Zune ID.
5389740	5394340	That might be kind of cool, especially for custom soundtracks and games and all that
5394340	5395340	stuff.
5395340	5396740	Might be interesting.
5396740	5398400	Very interesting.
5398400	5402580	Also interesting, this collaboration we're hearing about, it's a rumor.
5402580	5404580	Take this with a heavy grain of salt right now.
5404580	5406260	But remember the game Deus Ex?
5406260	5407260	Remember that game?
5407260	5408260	Yeah.
5408260	5412700	That was, what, they had like two games, maybe, no, I think there were two games in that series.
5412700	5418020	I think I remember checking it out on GameTab a long, long, long time ago.
5418020	5422700	The whole series was designed by this guy, Warren Spector.
5422700	5427420	It's very interesting, he said at one point, I guess, what, way back in like June 2007
5427420	5434020	that he was working on a new project and folks would tell him that he is sold out, at least
5434020	5437340	that's what hardcore gamers would say, that he's sold out.
5437340	5444060	Apparently what this guy is working on, and this is from, I guess, some type of tipster
5444060	5449780	to the website Gamasutra, the project title that is being worked on right now is Epic
5449780	5452820	Mickey.
5452820	5457020	Apparently this game has a distinctly shadowed steampunk vibe.
5457020	5461880	Now however, I don't, this is the part I don't understand, is that they are saying that maybe
5461880	5465460	it's talking about Mickey as in Mickey Mouse?
5465460	5466460	But I don't think so.
5466460	5468700	I think it's just saying the title of the project is Epic Mickey.
5468700	5472440	I think some of these other websites are jumping to conclusions and that it is actually Mickey
5472440	5473440	Mouse.
5473440	5477540	Although I guess if you put it all together, I've sold out and the project is Epic Mickey.
5477540	5481780	Could it be that there is some type of Epic Mickey Mouse game being made?
5481780	5482780	Maybe it's Epic Fail.
5482780	5485740	Or Epic Mickey Rourke.
5485740	5488380	My thought is though, isn't Epic Mickey Kingdom Hearts?
5488380	5491020	I mean, what could this guy be doing that is different than that?
5491020	5493780	Does that make sense?
5493780	5495780	I don't know.
5495780	5500180	But apparently it goes all the way back to referencing something that, you know, the
5500180	5506460	rumor guy on Electronic Gaming Monthly had said that apparently it actually ties into
5506460	5509460	that Specter is working on, in fact, a Disney product.
5509460	5512740	So that's what kind of all, where it all ties together.
5512740	5513740	Very interesting.
5513740	5518100	And that apparently it could be actually a game where Mickey does battle with Mario.
5518100	5519460	Isn't that weird?
5519460	5520460	That would be stupid.
5520460	5522980	That sounds like a fanboy, something they wrote out on paper.
5522980	5523980	I don't know.
5523980	5525940	Mickey is never going to do battle with Mario.
5525940	5527860	Well again, how is that really different from Kingdom Hearts?
5527860	5529580	Does that make sense?
5529580	5532620	Yeah, but what if, say, yeah, I don't know.
5532620	5536440	Maybe they're getting greedy and they just want, you know, their own Kingdom Hearts where
5536440	5537940	they get all the profits.
5537940	5540940	GSCCA says Mushroom Kingdom Hearts?
5540940	5541940	It's a nice thought.
5541940	5545100	I mean, like, maybe it's a Nintendo Wii game.
5545100	5547540	I mean, you want to talk about selling out?
5547540	5550980	This guy's making a game that involves Mickey and Mario on the Nintendo Wii.
5550980	5554140	Oh my god, could they do a Mario RPG too?
5554140	5555380	Now we're talking.
5555380	5556380	Now we're talking.
5556380	5559780	But they can't do it without Square Enix, sorry, because that would be epic fail.
5559780	5564340	Well maybe it will be for the Nintendo Wii what Sony has for Kingdom Hearts, if that
5564340	5565340	makes sense.
5565340	5566340	I don't know.
5566340	5568900	It could be interesting.
5568900	5570660	Could be interesting.
5570660	5576660	But I think there's a lot of in-between-the-line reading going on in this particular story.
5576660	5580060	So I think we ought to just wait until this guy decides to tell us what he's working on.
5580060	5581060	Could be.
5581060	5582060	Alright.
5582060	5586820	Game Guru in chat says Mario and Mickey at the Olympic Games?
5586820	5587820	Could be, could be.
5587820	5592300	Hey, we want to take a moment here to look back on the year 2008 and our favorite games
5592300	5596740	of the year 2008, and we've actually kind of combined it, or we'll be combining it here
5596740	5601900	with votes that you submitted during the break here live in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com.
5601900	5603620	We've closed the polls there.
5603620	5608940	And now we're going to add to it our favorite games of 2008, using any criteria we want.
5608940	5611580	That's why we don't like to say the top games of 2008.
5611580	5615980	No, they're our favorite games of 2008, using any criteria we want.
5615980	5618780	So if we want to put some game you think is crappy on there, too bad.
5618780	5622580	It's our favorite games of 2008, and then I'll let you know what collectively is in
5622580	5625380	all our listenership we came up with.
5625380	5630340	Dark Sakura, what was your number three favorite- how appropriate this music comes on, just
5630340	5631340	the right time.
5631340	5636780	What would you say was your number three favorite video game in the year 2008?
5636780	5637780	Rock Band 2.
5637780	5638780	Rock Band 2.
5638780	5642020	Any particular reason why?
5642020	5644460	Do I need to name them all?
5644460	5646420	Really?
5646420	5651420	It's just such a massive library.
5651420	5656700	Having the different instruments and everything, even on top of that, you could import your
5656700	5659300	list from the first Guitar Hero and it would all work.
5659300	5660300	You mean Rock Band?
5660300	5661300	Rock Band.
5661300	5662300	You know what I mean?
5662300	5663300	That's right.
5663300	5664300	This brings me to my next point.
5664300	5666700	The one thing that it did not have going for it is the guitars.
5666700	5672140	The guitars suck, and I would only use the Guitar Hero guitars.
5672140	5678380	This is a game that narrowly missed being on my list, but I love this game.
5678380	5681780	What did you think, though, compared to the first game?
5681780	5685100	At first, when I first sat down with Rock Band 2, I was kind of like, eh, this feels
5685100	5686100	like Rock Band 1.5.
5686100	5688860	I think that might be part of the reason it didn't make my top three is because I do feel
5688860	5693980	like it was an upgrade of what I played last year, but there is a lot of new, cool stuff.
5693980	5694980	You know what I mean?
5694980	5695980	There is enough.
5695980	5700580	The multiplayer, when you make your band, you can actually save your character per your
5700580	5706180	account, and I think that's a lot better, because it was really irritating going back
5706180	5710820	to playing the first Rock Band over at my friend's house and having to save my character
5710820	5712980	on her profile.
5712980	5713980	It was really irritating.
5713980	5714980	Okay.
5714980	5717660	Loki, what was your number three favorite game of the year?
5717660	5719900	Yeah, that's tough.
5719900	5721780	Let me narrow it down.
5721780	5725100	Let's see, and we're going to try to be a little different here.
5725100	5732780	Lost Odyssey, because Lost Odyssey this year was the only game that I feel is as close
5732780	5739180	to Final Fantasy as we're going to have in a while, until Final Fantasy XIII, and people
5739180	5743980	thought maybe Last Remnant, maybe some of these other games that had come out, no.
5743980	5748260	Lost Odyssey is the closest thing you're going to get to Final Fantasy XIII until XIII comes
5748260	5749260	out.
5749260	5750700	It plays exactly like a Final Fantasy game.
5750700	5754900	And just even apart from the Final Fantasy series, it was a good game with a good story.
5754900	5760140	Another game that narrowly missed my top three, that I thought was still incredibly good.
5760140	5762060	And again, I need to go back and finish.
5762060	5763060	Maybe part of the reason I didn't.
5763060	5764660	Yes, I need to finish it too.
5764660	5766780	I'm only a little ways into it.
5766780	5767780	Bradley, I have no idea.
5767780	5768780	Did you make a top three list?
5768780	5770780	I don't know if you played enough games this year or what.
5770780	5774500	I actually thought of three games that came out this year that I actually played.
5774500	5775500	Excellent!
5775500	5776500	What was your number three pick, Bradley?
5776500	5777500	I played only three games.
5777500	5780300	I think I bought one or two other that came out this year, but I didn't get around to
5780300	5781300	playing them.
5781300	5782300	That's all right.
5782300	5787420	So, number three, at the bottom of the list I played this year, but it's not bad, but
5787420	5791380	it's just DDR, DDRX.
5791380	5796220	And I actually only played like a few hours of it, and the stories are weird.
5796220	5799380	Whoa, they put stories in DDR?
5799380	5805820	There's this weird thing, they have the different stories for characters.
5805820	5809460	The first two, I think there's one or two characters that are unlocked at the beginning,
5809460	5815340	which is, I think it's Emi, and there's a new guy named Zero, who's like, the Zero guy,
5815340	5821460	he's just like the stoic sort of guy, he doesn't say very much, he's kind of, ugh, whatever.
5821460	5826540	Sort of like a weird Bishonen looking kind of guy, he's just like feh, because they do
5826540	5830660	this little story thing where they do something weird with each character, and then they do
5830660	5835620	a dance battle, either do a dance battle with somebody or just, oh, show off your moves.
5835620	5837820	Sounds too much like you got served to me.
5837820	5839860	Yeah, it's kind of silly.
5839860	5844260	Alright, well you know what though, I'm glad DDR is represented somewhere on the list,
5844260	5851380	because we did start up as a Bimani based radio station, so why not?
5851380	5855180	My number three game that I would pick on the list of the top three games that were
5855180	5861260	released in 2008, even though it's funny because I just said I didn't put a game on there because
5861260	5866540	it felt like a remake of an old game, my number three game on my list is a remake, but it's
5866540	5869940	a damn good one, and it's one that needed to be brought to the forefront because too
5869940	5873940	many people overlooked it the first time it came out, and that is Res HD, is my third
5873940	5881780	favorite game of 2008, because I just think this game is an experience.
5881780	5883900	It is, god, I just love this game.
5883900	5888860	Even though at its premise it's a relatively simple rail shooter, I think just turning
5888860	5895100	off all the lights inside the living room, turning on this game on your big HD TV, putting
5895100	5903980	those controllers on your lap or on your back or whatever they recommend you do, it's just
5903980	5904980	awesome.
5904980	5909720	It's a totally experience that I just don't get with a lot of other games, and so I really
5909720	5916020	love Res, so yes, make all the vibration jokes you want, but yes, Res HD is my number three
5916020	5919300	favorite game of 2008.
5919300	5922320	Dark Sakura, your number two favorite game of 2008.
5922320	5927180	My number two game would be Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
5927180	5929980	Ah, any particular reason why?
5929980	5935860	Dude, it's freaking, I only really played as Ken and Jun because I'm the big gachamon
5935860	5943740	fangirl, but it's really cool, it had actually so many different touches that if you were
5943740	5950440	fans of the old Tatsunoko series, it's just like big fangasm right then and there.
5950440	5956220	So many good touches, except for the Happy Thumb Ball of Doom, I hated the Happy Thumb
5956220	5961860	Ball of Doom, but the rest of it was pretty freaking fun, and it's just like playing Marvel
5961860	5989460	vs. Capcom in its control, it was really cool.
5989460	5992940	The characters we knew were going to be good, but you know you've heard of projects like
5992940	5996780	these and you go, oh boy, it's kind of like games based off movies, you're always kind
5996780	6000340	of like, oh boy, these are going to kind of stink, but the game was surprisingly decent,
6000340	6001660	so I can see that.
6001660	6004340	Loki, your number two game of the year.
6004340	6009200	My number two game of the year, it's tough.
6009200	6016300	I would, I guess I'm just going to have to go with Saints Row 2.
6016300	6017300	Saints Row 2.
6017300	6026740	I love my sandbox games, and you know, unfortunately I can't add Left 4 Dead or Fallout 3, I'm
6026740	6033020	not going to talk about Fable 2, and oh man, there's other games I would like to play,
6033020	6039820	or I'd like to have on my list here, but Saints Row 2 was actually, I thought, a little bit
6039820	6045140	better than, or more fun for me than Granthathot of 4, even though I still play Granthathot
6045140	6050980	of 4 today, but, and that is pretty fun, especially now that I can mod it, but it was an overall
6050980	6055220	fun game, and I really can't wait for the next one to come out.
6055220	6062020	Saints Row 3, in 2010 maybe, alright, awesome, we know you never shut up about that game
6062020	6065580	on the show, so it's no surprise that's showing up on your list, but that's cool, sandbox
6065580	6067380	games can be a lot of fun.
6067380	6069520	Bradley, number two, for you.
6069520	6076940	This game had the unfortunate circumstance that I picked up Zelda Phantom Hourglass and
6076940	6081420	didn't get back to it, but, since it's the other game that I played this year, it's Sonic
6081420	6086860	Chronicles, the Dark Brotherhood, and I only got to like, maybe the third mission, but
6086860	6097300	it's pretty fun, but Zelda just took over, so, but it's not too bad.
6097300	6103660	Alright, Sonic Chronicles, what every Sonic fan should, you know, be checking out probably,
6103660	6104660	right?
6104660	6105660	Maybe?
6105660	6106660	I don't know.
6106660	6114100	Alright, my number two game that I put on my list was a game that came out for a relatively
6114100	6121020	low price, and was, again, it was an experience, and it was also on Xbox Live Arcade, it was
6121020	6125700	a good year for Xbox Live Arcade, Braid was my number two pick of game I enjoyed this
6125700	6128220	year.
6128220	6134100	You know, that whole games as art thing, I mean, the game just moves like a painting,
6134100	6142240	has a surprisingly great story with depth, and is a puzzler game that's got a pretty
6142240	6145300	interesting twist on the whole usual 2D platformer.
6145300	6148580	I had a lot of fun with it, and it wasn't something, you know, it felt very rewarding
6148580	6153380	when you actually beat a puzzle, even though it was tempting to use walkthroughs, if you
6153380	6157180	stick with it, it's going to be very rewarding to beat some of the puzzles.
6157180	6161140	So I picked Braid, because I thought that game was great.
6161140	6165820	Alright, number one favorite game all freaking year, Dark Sakura.
6165820	6167900	I'd say Castlevania, Order of Ecclesia.
6167900	6168900	Oh!
6168900	6174800	It's been pissing me the hell off, but I've been having the most fun with it, so it definitely,
6174800	6178940	it gets back to, I think, what made Symphony of the Night fun, so.
6178940	6180580	Alright.
6180580	6183620	Even though that game frustrates me to no end, it was pretty cool.
6183620	6185780	Alright, Loki.
6185780	6190420	Your number one favorite game all freaking year.
6190420	6194620	You know, I'd normally go with Grand Theft Auto IV, because, you know, it's Grand Theft
6194620	6200200	Auto, but actually, I'm going to have to say Little Big Planet, just because of, it was
6200200	6201200	just a fun game.
6201200	6206140	I mean, it's hard to really pick one game, but Little Big Planet, this is definitely
6206140	6211460	a game I could see myself playing, you know, months from now, so, out to go with Little
6211460	6212460	Big Planet.
6212460	6213460	Alright.
6213460	6215700	Little Big Planet.
6215700	6219260	Lots to do in Little Big Planet, lots of replayability value.
6219260	6223420	Bradley, your number one favorite game of 2008.
6223420	6228620	And it's actually not even, maybe, not exactly a game, but it has games in it, I've learned
6228620	6234180	that it's what I actually have on my DS right now, playing, it's My Japanese Coach, and
6234180	6238460	I'll let it speak for itself.
6238460	6247700	Hey, I hope you heard that.
6247700	6252720	That's what I love about this show, you really can use any criteria you want, so if you want
6252720	6256220	to put My Japanese Coach as your number one game of the year, you go ahead.
6256220	6262500	Yeah, that's good for learning, and I actually recommend it if you want to learn Japanese.
6262500	6267140	If you're just starting out, you probably want to have some help, or get into a class,
6267140	6271740	but this would also be good to help along in, especially if it's good if you've forgotten
6271740	6275880	a lot and need to get back in, get your skills back up.
6275880	6279460	A shout out for the educational games, there you go.
6279460	6283620	Alright, my number one game of the year, you know what, you've been listening to this show
6283620	6287020	long enough, you know me well enough, what do you think?
6287020	6289380	My number one game of the year, this shouldn't be hard.
6289380	6291820	Super Metroid.
6291820	6294300	Maybe about 15 years ago, yes.
6294300	6296140	Or number one game of all time, maybe.
6296140	6299020	Loki, I know you've got to know.
6299020	6301200	Sing Star Abba.
6301200	6305020	That's a damn good pick, and I am very tempted to put that on my list, but no, I tried to
6305020	6311700	be halfway serious with this list, and as much as I love Sing Star Abba for its nostalgia
6311700	6316500	value for me, the game itself needs some improvement.
6316500	6318400	But Loki, try again.
6318400	6320720	If I'm being serious, what do you think the number one?
6320720	6321720	Little Big Planet.
6321720	6325900	You're absolutely right, Little Big Planet is my number one favorite game of 2008, because
6325900	6330420	I think this game is amazing.
6330420	6335740	Despite all the hubble we had about the moderation that went on earlier this year, I mean, God,
6335740	6341260	I wouldn't even need half of that, and those user-created levels in the game itself, even
6341260	6346260	by itself, is amazing, and I'm having a wonderful time with it, and the potential that this
6346260	6351420	game has for expansion is awesome, and now that they gave Sackboy a gun, it's even better,
6351420	6355100	and this game is amazing.
6355100	6357900	So I love Little Big Planet, it's my number one game of the year.
6357900	6364300	Now, we put our votes together with you guys in the chat room, and kind of some surprising
6364300	6365300	results.
6365300	6371100	If we were to put together, you guys had picks all up and down the spectrum, and all throughout
6371100	6374540	the spectrum of gaming, like you probably named like 40 different games between you
6374540	6376180	guys.
6376180	6379840	Here's the interesting thing, if we were to put our list together with the chat room,
6379840	6384520	there would be a tie for the number one game of 2008, with Little Big Planet, because Loki
6384520	6387900	and I naming it as number one game of the year probably helps, but get this, you know
6387900	6389020	what the other number one game would be?
6389020	6393180	It would be one none of us named, Mega Man 9, would be the game of the year.
6393180	6395180	That's worthy.
6395180	6400380	That retro throwback, and even Little Big Planet has a little bit of that sense in it,
6400380	6407020	the whole 2D platformer with it, definitely our fans are big on the throwbacks.
6407020	6412460	You see, also surprising what would come in second place, kind of some ties all around
6412460	6418260	here, we have Left 4 Dead, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, and Rock Band 2.
6418260	6422020	So even though somebody named Rock Band 2, nobody named the other ones, and those were
6422020	6426300	very well loved amongst our listeners, Brawl, probably the Wii title to have this year,
6426300	6430520	and Left 4 Dead, which as far as shooters go has been pretty amazing.
6430520	6434660	And then third place would be yet another one we didn't even name, Fallout 3.
6434660	6437860	But obviously the topic of that's come up earlier in the show, and at least for me that's
6437860	6441980	one of those games that I'll get to it when it comes down in price a little later on after
6441980	6445960	I finish these other games I want to play.
6445960	6450660	So there it is, your favorite games of 2008.
6450660	6453700	Very interesting to see some of the other things that people picked.
6453700	6459260	Castle Crashers, DJ Max, Wii Sports, somebody put in their list, even two years later shows
6459260	6463860	you the staying power of a game like that, Gears of War 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo
6463860	6473460	HD Remix, Fable 2, Castle Crashers, Tomb Raider, the new one, Bionic Commander Rearmed, Chrono
6473460	6482660	Trigger DS, Bioshock, Mario Kart Wii, NHL 2009, the list goes on and on.
6482660	6484840	Very nice.
6484840	6487100	Pretty good year for games overall?
6487100	6488700	I would say so.
6488700	6492300	I would say yes unless you're the Nintendo Wii, I think the Nintendo Wii had maybe one
6492300	6497180	or two great games on it, and the rest was shovelware in my opinion.
6497180	6500380	Loki, was it a good year for games in 2008?
6500380	6501940	It was okay.
6501940	6502940	It was okay.
6502940	6506420	All right, let's see if it was a good year for The Mailbag.
6506420	6510940	Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and we
6510940	6515660	read some of your mail right here on this program in a little segment we appropriately
6515660	6524540	call The Mailbag.
6524540	6526980	Well we've only got one email.
6526980	6527980	Just one.
6527980	6528980	Fail.
6528980	6531180	Well, it's a decent one though.
6531180	6536300	Hey OLR, season's greetings and all the rest, excellent job with the show, I really enjoy
6536300	6537300	it.
6537300	6538300	Thank you.
6538300	6539620	I have a small question about reviews.
6539620	6543020	I know you guys review games on your own show quite frequently.
6543020	6545660	Depends on if they suck, how much they suck, etc.
6545660	6549580	I must confess that I'm a bit of a casual gamer and also a poor college student, so
6549580	6552580	don't have any money to pick up every game you guys review.
6552580	6557340	However, when I do decide to pick up a game, I usually look at games that came out quasi
6557340	6561740	recently and take into account what you guys said about it.
6561740	6565540	That being said, I can't go through every episode to find the exact spot where you reviewed
6565540	6566540	a certain game.
6566540	6571620	I poked around the forums a bit, and I can't find a lot of places where you reviewed games.
6571620	6575020	I know this might take up a little more of your time, but wouldn't it be cool if you
6575020	6580100	had a place where you just had a little snippet of what you said about a game, gave it a thumbs
6580100	6585460	up or thumbs down, and limited this to only the popular or big title games that came out.
6585460	6589060	For example, I remember this guy recently liked Little Big Planet, but I can't remember
6589060	6591580	what Dark Sakura said about Animal Crossing.
6591580	6594200	It was the same, by the way.
6594200	6598260	Even if not all of you played the game, I still value each of your opinions because
6598260	6600500	you guys never seem to leave me astray.
6600500	6604940	I'm not proposing an entire archive of what everyone nitpicked about every single aspect
6604940	6605940	of each game.
6605940	6609940	I'm just looking for an easy, and preferably online, way to find out if you approved of
6609940	6612380	a certain game before I go and get it.
6612380	6613380	Just something to think about.
6613380	6638180	I hope your holidays are awesome, Amplitude.
6638180	6665940	Well I will tell you this, that Sauce actually has a review blog that we've talked about
6665940	6675140	some reviews on there before, but it's at Avengers-Tower.com, I think it is?
6675140	6679340	And she puts up a lot of reviews there, and I was actually kind of thinking about getting
6679340	6686920	back into blogging some game related stuff, since I'm actually playing things a bit more,
6686920	6693120	and actually since I'm chatting with her, she suggested get a Gamefly account too.
6693120	6697620	If you guys know anyone who is really good at website design, and I mean really serious
6697620	6698620	inquiries on me-
6698620	6699620	Oh, there's no Dash in that, by the way.
6699620	6700620	Oh.
6700620	6701620	Just Avengers Tower.
6701620	6702620	Please send them my way.
6702620	6706340	And I'm not talking about hosting or admin, because we have a guy who does that who is
6706340	6710900	amazing, but I'm talking about the design itself of a website and being able to run
6710900	6711900	it.
6711900	6717120	I would even be willing to throw money out there if it's not too extreme, so get in touch
6717120	6718120	with me.
6718120	6720780	A lot of times, and maybe you've tried to before, but it fell through the cracks because
6720780	6724580	you get a lot of freaking spam, but I'll try to keep my eye out over the next week.
6724580	6731920	If you have ideas on how we can get OLR's website functional for types of requests like
6731920	6737140	this, I would love to hear it, because unfortunately, with a full-time job and school and stuff,
6737140	6738140	we got no time.
6738140	6740620	Yeah, we were using WinMatter before, or using-
6740620	6743220	We're still using PHP Nuke, and it's just an old system.
6743220	6746620	No, I meant for our old blog that we used to have.
6746620	6747620	Old blog?
6747620	6749820	Yeah, remember the blog that we had up way back in the day?
6749820	6750820	God, yeah.
6750820	6753820	I think it was called GrayMatter or something like that.
6753820	6755020	That was old.
6755020	6757780	We could probably throw up a WordPress easy, but I don't know.
6757780	6760860	WordPress was what we used.
6760860	6765340	We could just try reviving that too.
6765340	6768860	The website as it is today has just kind of looked the same for the past four years.
6768860	6773060	I'm ready to nuke it and try something else, kind of like how they blew up the Stardust
6773060	6774060	for building a new hotel.
6774060	6775060	PHP Nuke!
6775060	6776060	Yeah, exactly.
6776060	6777060	Nuke!
6777060	6779780	Explore the nuke in PHP Nuke.
6779780	6782180	We don't need help in hosting or any of that stuff.
6782180	6785180	We got that covered because Jason's the man, but we just need help in writing.
6785180	6788820	We just need a website that looks less- Yeah.
6788820	6789860	Less.
6789860	6791640	Our strength is radio, guys.
6791640	6793580	That's the thing you got to learn.
6793580	6795420	Radio is what we've done for seven years, not website design.
6795420	6799300	Hey, I can update PHP BB, so don't worry about that.
6799300	6801300	I did my own board.
6801300	6802300	Awesome.
6802300	6809260	That's- I'm going to give it a refresh just to see, but you know what?
6809260	6810260	No.
6810260	6811260	All right.
6811260	6812260	That's all right.
6812260	6813260	How dare they?
6813260	6818340	Probably because I've been very behind on updating the podcast again, and you know,
6818340	6819340	oops.
6819340	6824780	I will resolve in the new year to get us all caught up and current again.
6824780	6826740	So hooray.
6826740	6830460	Let's move on with a couple more news stories, just a couple, and then we're going to do
6830460	6831460	listless tonight.
6831460	6832460	We haven't done listless in forever.
6832460	6834420	This will be fun.
6834420	6836420	Listless tonight.
6836420	6839660	Top three news stories of 2008.
6839660	6841460	Top three news stories will be tonight's listless.
6841460	6842460	It'll be fun.
6842460	6845140	It'll be quick, too, because there's only three of us, and then we've got Skype, too.
6845140	6846140	Don't worry.
6846140	6847140	We'll have Skype.
6847140	6849140	We'll have plenty of time for that.
6849140	6850820	Lucky news.
6850820	6851880	Yes.
6851880	6858300	So there was a game that was coming out, a RPG called Cryon that looked pretty cool.
6858300	6865520	Unfortunately, the development company AQ Interactive that was behind it decided, well,
6865520	6872220	they're just not going to release it because apparently due to the financial situation
6872220	6879220	that they're in and that kind of stuff and their forecasts that they're going to not
6879220	6885980	really continue development on it, the current market environment, and the forecasts for
6885980	6892100	the future, and of course they apologized to everybody that was waiting for the release.
6892100	6893100	But too bad.
6893100	6894100	Yeah.
6894100	6895100	I think this was a game that they were showing off.
6895100	6901980	I want to say either the very first year of 360 came out or maybe a little bit after.
6901980	6914340	It's basically, what was it, a team that composed of Miss Walker and Artoon.
6914340	6916020	What's Miss Walker been working on lately?
6916020	6918500	Are they doing Lost Odyssey 2 and Blue Dragon 2?
6918500	6920100	Well, there's a Blue Dragon DS game.
6920100	6921100	Oh, yeah.
6921100	6922100	That's right.
6922100	6923980	I think there's some other Miss Walker game that's coming out.
6923980	6925940	There were about a few things I remember.
6925940	6929100	They've already confirmed a sequel to Lost Odyssey, though, right?
6929100	6930100	I don't know.
6930100	6931100	I think they did.
6931100	6932100	I think they did.
6932100	6933100	We'll see.
6933100	6934100	Hey, follow up.
6934100	6936500	Remember last week we just had depression upon depression?
6936500	6941900	All these studios were closing left and right, and some of them were rumor status, and one
6941900	6943700	of those was free radical.
6943700	6949700	Unfortunately, it has been confirmed that as of December 31st, free radical is going
6949700	6952540	to be downsizing significantly.
6952540	6956260	Seventy-five percent of its workforce, 140 employees.
6956260	6960140	That means only 40 people will be left, and they're selling the business.
6960140	6965300	There are some other companies out there that are apparently interested in picking up this
6965300	6971160	company, but who knows who is going to snap up this company yet?
6971160	6972420	But that's a bummer.
6972420	6978380	140 employees get laid off right at the end of the year during the holidays.
6978380	6979500	Damn this economy.
6979500	6981180	Damn it.
6981180	6982180	So there it is.
6982180	6985540	The free radical is closing its doors.
6985540	6993120	Well, just the countless news upon news articles of studios shutting their doors is just one
6993120	6997460	of the big things that happened in 2008, but we thought we would take a look tonight at
6997460	7002440	some of the top stories of 2008, the way that only we can do it here on Orange Lounge Radio
7002440	7008580	in a segment we call Listless.
7008580	7009580	That's right.
7009580	7015860	On Orange Lounge Radio, we do a segment called Listless where we invite the host to submit
7015860	7021780	their top three, and then we have the chat room vote on the list that is prepared and
7021780	7027500	come up with the ultimate list, and today's topic is the top three stories of 2008.
7027500	7031340	Now what's interesting tonight is that I don't believe Bradley is going to be able to participate
7031340	7034620	because I don't think he's been following enough stories this year to tell us he's shaking
7034620	7035620	his head no.
7035620	7040220	It's just dark soccer on myself and Loki to have lists out there, so because there's only
7040220	7044340	so many of us participating tonight, there will be no elimination round in tonight's
7044340	7045340	Listless.
7045340	7049580	So, it's an open table for anything you want to submit to the list tonight.
7049580	7052700	And remember, you guys can use any criteria you want.
7052700	7054560	That's part of what makes Orange Lounge Radio unique.
7054560	7061500	We don't profess to be the experts or the analysts and all that crap.
7061500	7062500	They get paid money.
7062500	7063500	We don't.
7063500	7064860	So we can use whatever criteria we want.
7064860	7069700	So that being said, dark soccer, biggest news story of 2008, number three, what would you
7069700	7070700	say?
7070700	7075220	The asshole getting smacked down.
7075220	7077180	About fucking time.
7077180	7081180	He who shall not be named loses his license to practice law in Florida, correct?
7081180	7082180	Yes.
7082180	7083180	Alright.
7083180	7087500	That was a pretty monumentous occasion that involved confetti being tossed and hurrays
7087500	7088500	everywhere.
7088500	7089500	Alright.
7089500	7092260	DJ Dark Knight says, let the chatters kick one out.
7092260	7093260	I don't know.
7093260	7096540	Should we let the chatters maybe put, like, one thing on the list so we have a nice even
7096540	7097540	ten?
7097540	7098540	Sure.
7098540	7099540	Alright.
7099540	7100540	I'll do this.
7100540	7103620	At a certain time, I'm going to open up the Skype line and we'll let you guys put one
7103620	7104860	thing on the list.
7104860	7105860	Alright.
7105860	7108740	Loki, you're number three.
7108740	7113260	Oh man, that's tough.
7113260	7121780	I guess because we talked a lot about it.
7121780	7125740	I guess the, it'd be funny, Rock Revolution, not me announcing that they're doing Rock
7125740	7130300	Revolution, or was that, no that was actually the year before last, or was that this E3?
7130300	7132300	I can't remember.
7132300	7137180	This E3 was the one where they really botched it publicly, you might remember, so maybe
7137180	7138180	you want to use that.
7138180	7139180	Take that off.
7139180	7140180	Take that off.
7140180	7141180	Oh, no.
7141180	7142180	I got it.
7142180	7147700	Nintendo fucking up their E3 press conference.
7147700	7149700	Care to elaborate?
7149700	7154260	Yes, their demonstration of Wii music and how it butchered the Super Mario Brothers
7154260	7164220	theme, stories about snowboarding and Sun's, I guess, holiday cards or stuff like that,
7164220	7168980	and what was the other thing that they showed that was really crappy?
7168980	7171620	Oh, Animal Crossing and how it wasn't different.
7171620	7175420	Yeah, Game Guru in the chat room asked a question a lot of people are going to ask you.
7175420	7176420	What fuck up?
7176420	7178500	Some people would say they did not fuck up.
7178500	7182420	Okay, disappointing showing at E3.
7182420	7184500	Clearly they had the worst press conference.
7184500	7190460	They were supposed to make this big splash to come back for ignoring the core gamer,
7190460	7194620	and they ignored the core gamer, yeah.
7194620	7195620	Alright.
7195620	7198900	Alright, we said anything you want?
7198900	7201020	Tiger Claus says, how about the drummer pretending to drum?
7201020	7204100	So you do have some allies in your corner there.
7204100	7207940	My number three that I would put on the list, I would say the story, and I don't know if
7207940	7211500	you remember this, but part of the reason I'm putting it on the list is because of the
7211500	7216180	endless lulls that it brought us on this show, but do you remember when a website called
7216180	7221940	WhatTheyPlay.com ran a poll, and this poll discovered that people out there are more
7221940	7229580	offended by sex and gay kissing than multiple uses of the word fuck and disembodied heads?
7229580	7234940	Remember, gay kissing is more offensive than a severed head in a video game, so I believe
7234940	7241260	that whole asshattery, we will call the WhatTheyPlay.com asshattery, even though I feel really terrible
7241260	7245540	because I'm sure that website is like a fine website, it's just the users of that website
7245540	7254060	are asshats, the WhatTheyPlay.com asshattery is my third top news story of 2008, because
7254060	7257900	I think it really ties into a lot of these other types of censorship stories and even
7257900	7261580	asshole losing his license and all that stuff, I think it all kind of ties together.
7261580	7266660	It just really shows you the general public and how our views of the world can be very
7266660	7268060	fucked up sometimes.
7268060	7269060	Thank you.
7269060	7275540	All right, that takes us to our number twos, Dark Saga.
7275540	7283540	Number two will be Stephen Colbert and Rock Band.
7283540	7285780	That was pretty epic to have Stephen Colbert and Rock Band.
7285780	7287260	That was fucking epic.
7287260	7295140	You can actually add Stephen Colbert and Jonathan Coulton in Rock Band.
7295140	7296140	Have yourself a party.
7296140	7297140	Hell yeah.
7297140	7302460	All right, that's right, Charlene was available in Rock Band for free, so it's free Stephen
7302460	7303940	Colbert and Rock Band.
7303940	7305460	Yeah, even better.
7305460	7307140	Twice as amazing.
7307140	7309660	So we've got a free write-off of them, huh?
7309660	7313140	And easiest way to get some of those achievements because the song is so short.
7313140	7315340	Just want to point that out.
7315340	7320460	Loki, your number two top news story of 2008.
7320460	7323780	Just because it was funny to make fun of how ridiculous everything was getting.
7323780	7326260	The Little Big Planet controversy.
7326260	7333180	Seriously, a song with lyrics that most people won't understand, can't possibly get offended
7333180	7334180	by them.
7334180	7335700	What was up with that?
7335700	7339460	Like seriously, the guy had won Grammys and does this stuff all his time in his albums
7339460	7343020	and nobody had ever had a problem with it before and even the guy who complained about
7343020	7348620	it was like, I didn't mean to like recall the game, you could have just like patched
7348620	7349620	it out.
7349620	7350620	Panic!
7350620	7351620	Panic!
7351620	7352620	Panic!
7352620	7353620	Panic!
7353620	7354620	Panic!
7354620	7358220	This is the new motto at Sony, whenever we talk about Sony headquarters, panic, panic,
7358220	7359220	panic!
7359220	7360220	Eat crayon, panic!
7360220	7363620	That's right, the crayon eating leads to panicking.
7363620	7368540	Do you think that maybe there's some chemical in like the crayon that causes people to panic?
7368540	7370540	Been dying there before.
7370540	7377140	Alright, my number two was going to also be the news story about Nintendo burning their
7377140	7379060	hardcore gamers at E3.
7379060	7388180	But since Loki stole that, I will say the news that E for All got canned and old E3
7388180	7392540	is coming back because I think it goes to show a lot of people said, it wouldn't work,
7392540	7397500	it wouldn't work and as much as they're trying to say, well you know we tried something different
7397500	7403820	and it didn't work, so old E3 is returning is my number two story of 2008.
7403820	7406140	Old E3 returning, bye bye E for All.
7406140	7412140	Where did E for All not work out, do you guys think, everything?
7412140	7418300	I think that it was a good concept but because there was already this expectation of what
7418300	7426940	was there before, it really did rub raw with a lot in the community and really I think
7426940	7435220	a lot of the hype was really really brought up at the big E3 orgy, I'm sorry it was the
7435220	7440780	orgy of game, so that really actually cut down a lot of advertising for them I thought.
7440780	7445660	They had a Target booth where you could buy games, oh my god, where will we find a Target
7445660	7451900	on, I don't know, anywhere in the United States, oh wait no they're everywhere that's right,
7451900	7456540	so yes of course you need to go to E for All to go buy your games.
7456540	7462380	Gangru wants to point out in chat that Capcom he believes was the worst at E3, at least
7462380	7467820	Nintendo talked about actual games, that was a good point, Capcom got up there and sucked
7467820	7474900	their own dicks for an hour basically is what they did, which you think would be an impressive
7474900	7477140	thing to watch but in fact it was really boring.
7477140	7482100	It would be like if I went to an old folks home and talked about how awesome games are,
7482100	7486820	they would probably boo me off the stage and go to sleep.
7486820	7491060	Same thing was happening with the casual game stuff, I know that a lot of people like casual
7491060	7496220	games, which is great, but casual gamers don't really need to be up to date on what's coming
7496220	7498580	out because they're casual gamers.
7498580	7503260	They don't care about street dates, they don't care about having to play stuff right away,
7503260	7507500	they're casual, they're like hey cool, this game's awesome, it just came out, maybe I'll
7507500	7509140	give it a shot.
7509140	7516300	I don't know, it's just the core audience is what drives the consoles and you have to
7516300	7522540	appease the core audience and then get some more people in to become your core audience.
7522540	7525300	Gameguru says E3 is for the casual gamer and movie lover now.
7525300	7529140	I don't know, do you think having to go back to the old way somewhat, I mean we say the
7529140	7532580	old way although they say we're going to cap it at 40,000, they say they're going to make
7532580	7538060	it easier for podcasters to get in and I'm saying I'll believe it when I see it.
7538060	7551740	My podcasters, if you're an IGN podcaster, or people that do an incredible job at marketing
7551740	7555660	their podcasts, there's people out there that do a much better job at marketing themselves
7555660	7557460	and their hobby than we do, honestly.
7557460	7561180	This is something we've done for LoLs on a Sunday night for seven years, but some people
7561180	7564740	have really made a life out of it out there in the indie podcasting community, so I'm
7564740	7567060	not knocking that, props to them.
7567060	7571780	Do what you love, but I think they'll have an easier time getting into E3, but we will
7571780	7575620	still have to ask for handouts on the street corner.
7575620	7580860	All right, I promised that we would allow a listener to add something to the list, so
7580860	7582260	we're going to the Skype line right now.
7582260	7583260	Who's on the line?
7583260	7584260	This is Aki Ripper.
7584260	7585260	Aki Ripper!
7585260	7588260	How are you doing, my friend?
7588260	7589860	I'm doing just fine.
7589860	7590860	All right.
7590860	7596300	With the small, tiny detail that what the hell do I have to add to this, LoL?
7596300	7600900	Well, you got through.
7600900	7605300	You called when I said to call in chat, and I said a chat room person could add one item
7605300	7606300	to the list.
7606300	7608340	So we are about to start our number ones.
7608340	7612940	So Aki Ripper, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?
7612940	7614540	Any criteria you want.
7614540	7623260	Well, the only thing I can think of at the straight really is the dissemination of who
7623260	7625660	dare, that one who shall not be named.
7625660	7628780	So I fail, but automatic.
7628780	7629780	Sorry.
7629780	7631500	Well, yeah, and that's already on the list.
7631500	7633860	So you're not going to try and add something new to the list?
7633860	7639580	What would number two be?
7639580	7640780	I really got to be.
7640780	7644660	I am so really behind.
7644660	7645660	Gua!
7645660	7649200	Pardon me, I just failed.
7649200	7653580	Was there a game called Gua that was released this year?
7653580	7654580	Guar is a band.
7654580	7655580	I know that.
7655580	7659140	All right, Aki Ripper, I'll have to let you go.
7659140	7660340	Call back later.
7660340	7661340	Later.
7661340	7663380	All right.
7663380	7664380	People so excited to call in.
7664380	7665980	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7665980	7666980	Who's this?
7666980	7667980	Hey, it's Jason.
7667980	7668980	Guess what, Jason?
7668980	7672660	I turned on my volume and was like, wait, is that me?
7672660	7677140	The call before you, Jason, tried to name something that was already on the list because
7677140	7678140	of the delay.
7678140	7679140	Yeah, who shall not be named.
7679140	7680260	That's what I was just trying to turn down.
7680260	7683420	I know, because they're in a foreign country and all.
7683420	7686540	It takes like an hour for the delay and everything, yet they were able to call in.
7686540	7691860	No, but I reminded them that it didn't, okay, sorry, technical difficulties.
7691860	7692860	That's right.
7692860	7693860	Jason, that's good news for you.
7693860	7695980	That means you can put on whatever you want onto the list.
7695980	7700300	So what do you think was the top news story of 2008 in gaming?
7700300	7704060	I'm going to be a little bit egotistical with this one because of how everything went out.
7704060	7708420	The new Metal Gear Solid will be an iPhone game.
7708420	7711700	Oh, something a little recently here.
7711700	7712700	Okay.
7712700	7714180	Jason, I think this is such a big freaking deal.
7714180	7718820	Give me one moment so I'm not echoing all over the place.
7718820	7721260	You sound fine to us here in the studio, just so you know.
7721260	7722620	Yeah, you said that, but...
7722620	7726380	You sound like a tin can, but you sound fine.
7726380	7731540	I chose that simply for the fact that people went absolutely crazy about Metal Gear Solid
7731540	7733380	5, holy crap.
7733380	7734980	We've already gotten portable ops.
7734980	7738980	We've already gotten, what was it, Metal Gear Acid, am I even thinking about the right
7738980	7739980	game?
7739980	7741680	We've already got portable games, we've already got offshoots.
7741680	7745940	Before it just came out and they were really trying to end the series, the eye and the
7745940	7752900	logo just prime over-analytical-ness, that's what I mean.
7752900	7757060	Well, you know what's interesting is it's not just Metal Gear that Konami is putting
7757060	7758060	on the phone.
7758060	7761540	If I recall, they also announced DDR and some of their other big franchises on iPhones.
7761540	7766760	So to me, this is more of a story about that iPhone is starting to legitimately become
7766760	7770220	a gaming platform of sorts, as much to Loki's dismay.
7770220	7773340	Yeah, Konami Mobile, yeah, that sounds about right.
7773340	7777260	Yeah, but they already had cell phone games, so that's a gamey, I'm sorry.
7777260	7781740	Well, not Metal Gear, hence my real reliance right on that.
7781740	7785980	Yeah, but this isn't really a good Metal Gear game anyways.
7785980	7790940	Some interesting comments in chat, Bob Coffee says, Metal Gear Touch will fail.
7790940	7793860	Pitstun says, Metal Gear Touch is a glorified light gun game.
7793860	7797240	Game Guru says, Metal Gear Solid Touch should be on Wii.
7797240	7798860	So should the Silent Hill arcade game.
7798860	7800340	That should be on Wii.
7800340	7803580	All right, well, Jason, thank you so much for contributing to the list.
7803580	7806380	And we'll see what happens if the chat room votes it as one of the top three.
7806380	7807900	Hell yeah, you guys better.
7807900	7808900	All right, we'll see.
7808900	7809900	Bye.
7809900	7810900	Thanks.
7810900	7815460	All right, let's go around and get our in-studio, our number one picks for biggest news story
7815460	7816460	of 2008.
7816460	7820100	Dark Sakura, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?
7820100	7821180	The biggest news story?
7821180	7824460	I'd actually say our pair of anniversaries.
7824460	7825460	How so?
7825460	7827460	For the station, seriously.
7827460	7830140	No, really.
7830140	7831220	Any criteria you want.
7831220	7838920	It's really big for us because we not only hit 300 episodes, but we hit six years.
7838920	7846920	So I'd say that's fairly monumental that, you know, we're that bored.
7846920	7852300	You know, and I don't know if there is another, and if I am mistaken, please feel free to
7852300	7857440	correct me, but I don't think there is another show that runs weekly that has hit 300 episodes
7857440	7861020	in the history of the internet, of gaming.
7861020	7862460	If there is, please let me know.
7862460	7863460	And again, that's weekly.
7863460	7866740	I know there's some that ran daily that were able to hit 300 episodes, but I don't know
7866740	7870140	if any of them ran weekly because in order to hit 300 episodes, you would have to have
7870140	7871460	run for six years.
7871460	7872460	Trust us, we know.
7872460	7873460	Six and a half years.
7873460	7877620	Six and a half years, yeah, at this point because we take a week off once in a while.
7877620	7881340	So there you go.
7881340	7885660	By the way, major props to a Dark Sakura for her delivery of We're That Bored.
7885660	7887660	Alright.
7887660	7888980	Hey.
7888980	7889980	It's so true, though.
7889980	7894740	Alright, no, you know, we do it because, you know, what else would we do?
7894740	7895740	Crack?
7895740	7896740	Uh, Loki!
7896740	7898740	Well, since that was going to be my number one.
7898740	7899740	Winners don't use drugs.
7899740	7903580	But that was going to be my number one because I did dress up like, uh, Sackboy then.
7903580	7905820	That was going to be your number one?
7905820	7906820	Really?
7906820	7909180	My God, you're getting Capcom on me.
7909180	7910900	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, listen.
7910900	7915140	I have a better number one, though, because this small event happened.
7915140	7921960	In May of 2008, Activision announced that Guitar Hero, which became Guitar Hero World
7921960	7925820	Tour, would now have drums.
7925820	7927300	And would now be copying Rock Band.
7927300	7935220	It would be the first music game in the history of music games to have drums and guitars in
7935220	7936220	the same game.
7936220	7938700	Oh, wait, except that's inaccurate.
7938700	7942900	But that's what they said, or something like that.
7942900	7948260	Meaning like how, uh, they got up there, I think, and said, like, this is the first time
7948260	7951540	you're going to be able to get to play the guitar and play the drums and sing at the
7951540	7953620	same time, all in one game.
7953620	7956700	And everybody's just thinking, like, uh, lol, Rock Band.
7956700	7960700	Well, I think they meant in the Guitar Hero series, but yeah, yeah.
7960700	7964060	But you know, you know how them suits are.
7964060	7967340	They like to think that we're all ignorant, which is not true.
7967340	7968340	So.
7968340	7974340	All right, uh, my number one, I mean, I decided to pick something I actually think is the
7974340	7980140	number one thing that happened this year in gaming, like huge news, I think, that changes
7980140	7982180	gaming in a big, big way.
7982180	7985340	And uh, do you guys remember I've been talking about something that I said was going to be
7985340	7986460	huge for gaming?
7986460	7989780	It was announced early in the year and then happened, and I'm saying it's going to be
7989780	7991980	like the YouTube of the 360.
7991980	7992980	Sing Star Abba?
7992980	7996700	No, not Sing Star Abba!
7996700	8000620	Community games on the new Xbox experience, the fact that they brought in community games,
8000620	8003020	not just that, but Netflix.
8003020	8006500	So I'm going to kind of loop it all in and say the new Xbox experience, I think, is the
8006500	8010940	biggest new story of 2008 because it brought us not just the community games and the, you
8010940	8016860	know, web 2.0 age of my 360, but the fact that I can freaking stream movies to my 360.
8016860	8019940	That just bumped up its entertainment capacity by a ton.
8019940	8020940	You know what I mean?
8020940	8027380	It's not a gaming system, but a movie hub, you know, an entertainment system, really.
8027380	8033660	So uh, new, uh, NXC is my number one story of 2008.
8033660	8038100	But I want to specifically state it's because of community games and Netflix and not necessarily
8038100	8041540	because of stuff that was just to kind of catch up to other companies like the Avatars
8041540	8045180	and you know, there are some things about NXC I don't like, but I do think those two
8045180	8048620	particular aspects make it very, very relevant.
8048620	8052260	Sorry, I know, you would think Sing Star Abba would be there.
8052260	8055340	Maybe if I got to do a top five, I don't know.
8055340	8057420	All right.
8057420	8060700	So since we're skipping an elimination round this time, you guys get to vote on this as
8060700	8061700	it is right here.
8061700	8065260	I'm going to post this in the chat room there and you can send in your votes.
8065260	8067300	Prepare for floodage in chat.
8067300	8072460	All right, so you can place a vote for your number one and your number two picks in the
8072460	8074460	chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
8074460	8076340	These were the top ones.
8076340	8078740	Jack Thompson getting the beat down.
8078740	8082380	Nintendo fucks up the E3 press conference, as Loki said, fucked up.
8082380	8084940	WhatTheyPlay.com ass hattery.
8084940	8087100	Stephen Colbert is in rock band.
8087100	8090020	Little Big Planet Karan lyrics and the controversy.
8090020	8091900	Notice that's Karan, not Korean.
8091900	8095580	Old E3 is coming back, buy E for All.
8095580	8097340	Metal Gear goes to iPhone.
8097340	8100200	OLR hits 300 episodes in six years.
8100200	8103460	I love how that's mixed in with all these other stories.
8103460	8105640	Guitar Hero announces drums.
8105640	8108700	And edXE community game and Netflix.
8108700	8109780	So there you have it.
8109780	8115500	Send your number one and number two picks via private message to Sky in the chat room.
8115500	8118780	While you do that, we have some more news for you guys and we'll get to the results
8118780	8119780	shortly.
8119780	8120780	Please hurry and get those in.
8120780	8122900	Loki, we'll start off with you.
8122900	8123900	Yes.
8123900	8130740	Speaking of games with guitars and drums, Rock Band 2 for the Wii is finally going to
8130740	8134620	get some download content starting in early 2009.
8134620	8139420	They're going to be, I guess, adding that feature to it as well.
8139420	8145140	And they're going to start with the content that was originally available.
8145140	8150140	I think the free 20 song pack or whatever.
8150140	8152860	So that'll be interesting.
8152860	8155060	Oh, that's cool.
8155060	8162680	Yeah, free 20 song pack, I guess, that was available already and then the free 30 download
8162680	8167380	tracks from the original Rock Band download content library.
8167380	8168380	Huh.
8168380	8169780	Very cool.
8169780	8172860	So free songs for the people that bought Rock Band.
8172860	8174660	That's right, because the Wii people have to wait for a while.
8174660	8178340	Well, actually, no, I guess not because it just came out like last week or so.
8178340	8181740	So that wouldn't be too bad.
8181740	8184780	It's nice to see, though, that there's actual download content for some of these games.
8184780	8187860	I mean, because if you think about it, they haven't really done it.
8187860	8191380	I'm surprised, like even Animal Crossing or something, they haven't seen any really download
8191380	8192380	content.
8192380	8196260	I'm very surprised about that as well, considering, you know, how Nintendo is.
8196260	8197300	You know what I mean?
8197300	8201720	There's like no download content for any Nintendo stuff.
8201720	8208100	No new tracks in Mario Kart, no new characters in Smash Brothers, no new music in Wii Music.
8208100	8210180	Nothing.
8210180	8211180	Very surprised.
8211180	8212180	Me, too.
8212180	8213180	I am very surprised.
8213180	8215780	I'm very curious to see how the download content's going to work.
8215780	8217140	That is going to be very interesting.
8217140	8219100	Very, very interesting.
8219100	8220820	All right.
8220820	8222620	More stories, yes?
8222620	8224220	There is.
8224220	8231940	Actually, this is pretty cool that for Rock Band, they're actually getting some new content.
8231940	8237940	They're actually getting Roy Orbison.
8237940	8241180	How's that for cool?
8241180	8242180	Who's Roy Orbison?
8242180	8244220	It seems kind of random to me.
8244220	8251340	Well, this is actually reported by CMT, but they're actually putting in a pack of Roy
8251340	8257980	Orbison songs that are going to be on Rock Band 2.
8257980	8258980	They would know.
8258980	8261660	Didn't he do You Got It?
8261660	8262960	Yeah.
8262960	8265180	They would know because CMT is owned by MTV.
8265180	8266180	He sang Pretty Woman.
8266180	8267180	Yeah, he did.
8267180	8268180	Yeah.
8268180	8269180	Pretty Woman.
8269180	8270180	That's probably the song that's going to be there.
8270180	8271180	Just you wait.
8271180	8272620	Roy Orbison's cool.
8272620	8276260	Plus he was with the Traveling Wilburys, and that was pretty cool.
8276260	8284860	Well, Guitar Hero's going to be getting some more free download tracks in the form of two
8284860	8286940	Bruce Springsteen tracks.
8286940	8295260	Apparently, let's see, I guess, Born to Run and My Lucky Day.
8295260	8301940	I guess My Lucky Day's office new single, and Born to Run, of course, is a classic track.
8301940	8308140	Those will be available on both the PSN and Xbox Live Marketplace January 27th through
8308140	8309140	February 4th.
8309140	8310140	All right.
8310140	8317900	We're going to be opening up the Skype line and taking your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8317900	8320940	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8320940	8323660	You can go ahead and give us a call, and we'll take a couple of your calls.
8323660	8327980	Meanwhile, do we have any last minute stories here while I try to tally up the last of the
8327980	8332220	Cage Match votes, too?
8332220	8333220	No.
8333220	8335220	Yeah, it really wasn't a very busy week, was it?
8335220	8338260	In other news, Jamie wants a cookie.
8338260	8339940	There are cookies, actually, here in studio.
8339940	8340940	I know.
8340940	8344280	See, you left them here, and I was going to eat them all, but then I thought, what a good
8344280	8351980	idea to keep cookies in studio on hand for those moments when Jamie says, I need a cookie.
8351980	8356220	That's not going to actually happen after the beginning of the year, Rob.
8356220	8357980	Why are you going on a diet?
8357980	8359140	I don't go on diets.
8359140	8360140	Are you going on a lifestyle adjustment?
8360140	8363460	I adjust my lifestyle, and that's not exactly what I'm doing.
8363460	8364460	I'm readjusting.
8364460	8366980	Won't there be a type of cookie you can still eat?
8366980	8367980	Fiber.
8367980	8368980	All right.
8368980	8369980	Fiber cookies.
8369980	8370980	All right.
8370980	8371980	Fiberglass cookies.
8371980	8372980	Holy cookies.
8372980	8373980	All right.
8373980	8375100	If you hear a crackling noise, it's because I picked up a call like a minute ago, and
8375100	8376100	the poor guy's having to wait.
8376100	8377100	Hi.
8377100	8378100	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8378100	8379100	Who's this?
8379100	8380100	It's GSXPA, and no aesthetic.
8380100	8381580	I am not ordering a pizza for OLR.
8381580	8382580	Yeah.
8382580	8384940	Please don't order pizzas to the studio if you know where we live.
8384940	8386420	That's not nice.
8386420	8387980	GSXPA, what's on your mind?
8387980	8392340	Now, I think I know what's on your mind, because you live in a certain part of the Bay Area
8392340	8395620	where you got something special this week, right?
8395620	8396620	Yeah.
8396620	8398580	DJ Max Technica at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
8398580	8402500	Tell us about DJ Max Technica at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
8402500	8403500	What's it like?
8403500	8404500	Yeah.
8404500	8409340	Basically, it's kind of like Elite Beat Agents meets Luminous.
8409340	8410660	You have two halves of the screen.
8410660	8415020	You have this line going from one side of the screen to the other, and then there's
8415020	8416020	these markers.
8416020	8420380	You have to press it as the line goes over them.
8420380	8424900	And it's kind of like big meaning that as you press the markers, you recreate parts
8424900	8427900	of the music.
8427900	8429900	Yeah.
8429900	8430900	But will it blend?
8430900	8431900	No.
8431900	8432900	Is it fun?
8432900	8433900	That's what I want to know.
8433900	8434900	Is it fun?
8434900	8435900	Yeah.
8435900	8436900	Did you have fun with it?
8436900	8437900	It's pretty fun.
8437900	8445780	On the first day, we had 20 people in line, so between journeys, I had to wait 20 games,
8445780	8447220	which wasn't really a problem for me.
8447220	8449020	I just played other games between rounds.
8449020	8450020	My God.
8450020	8453500	Isn't that like a three-hour wait, 20 games, or at least an hour?
8453500	8458740	Well, the problem is the life meter on the game is very harsh.
8458740	8465140	If you miss seven to 10 notes in a row, you automatically fail, and it's not like say
8465140	8470220	popping music, where if you fail the first stage, you get to go to the next.
8470220	8475740	Plus, on the final stage, the difficulty for the progression from one stage to the next
8475740	8476740	is really harsh.
8476740	8481020	On the first stage, you can pick a level one song, but on the second, the lowest you can
8481020	8484740	pick is level three, I think, and for the final stage, the lowest you can pick is a
8484740	8485740	level five.
8485740	8491380	So by Thursday, you have songs that initially you have a lot of trouble with, and you end
8491380	8495220	up failing within the first 30 seconds.
8495220	8498900	All right, so I got to turn this call around real quick, though, and address another topic
8498900	8502300	that we brought up earlier in the show, because as neat as this game sounds and all, I've
8502300	8508140	got to know your thoughts on, because I know you're a DJ Maxx fan, the whole Konami lawsuit,
8508140	8509340	and don't just say it's bullshit.
8509340	8512300	I'm just curious, like, what are your thoughts?
8512300	8518580	Well, and you know that Konami sued Rockstar for In the Groove and won, right?
8518580	8519580	Sure, yeah.
8519580	8523660	Well, I mean, personally, I think the whole In the Groove thing had it coming, because
8523660	8527980	it was basically DDR, just with different music and charts, like, some modifiers.
8527980	8534460	DJ Maxx, I have different opinions for, because at least it seems to be different from Beat
8534460	8535460	Mania.
8535460	8541620	Like, for example, DJ Maxx's portable that, I mean, Konami hasn't really done a portable
8541620	8542620	2DX.
8542620	8547260	I mean, yeah, there's the Game Boy Beat Minis, but for money here, those aren't really good,
8547260	8548740	and they weren't very popular.
8548740	8558660	Whereas with DJ Maxx's portable here, it was so successful that it actually became its
8558660	8565660	own series, and so we just want to have mixed feelings about this lawsuit.
8565660	8575300	I mean, yeah, DJ Maxx is a lot like Beat Mania, but at the same time, I don't know if Panda
8575300	8579380	Vision really deserved this, I mean...
8579380	8583380	You know, I gotta say, though, you get us thinking about something, I gotta say, you
8583380	8586420	have a well-thought-out point, because you got me thinking about something I didn't think
8586420	8594100	about before, because, like, I kind of agree with you that the reason why In the Groove
8594100	8597500	got the beat down, I know a lot of people are pissed off about the whole In the Groove
8597500	8601100	lawsuit and everything, but let's face it, In the Groove was DDR, okay?
8601100	8606260	Like it was, like, really, really, really the same thing, okay?
8606260	8610220	But you're right, they haven't really put out, Konami has not really put out a portable
8610220	8614300	version of their game, and I don't even know if you can really count those Game Boy Beat
8614300	8617860	Mania games, because they were so long ago, they were on a completely different system,
8617860	8620340	they just weren't even the same as the PSP.
8620340	8622380	That is kind of an interesting point.
8622380	8624620	Anyone in the studio think that changes things at all?
8624620	8625620	No.
8625620	8626620	No?
8626620	8627620	Why not?
8627620	8632180	I mean, just because they, I don't think they're gonna put out a portable DDR, it just
8632180	8641420	doesn't make any sense, because the PSP right now, I guess it could be used as, you know,
8641420	8642900	you could play DDR on it.
8642900	8647140	Well, kind of like that StepMania thing for PSP, right?
8647140	8648140	That's what I was saying.
8648140	8652060	Yeah, you can't play DDR on it, but a lot of people would be like, what's the point?
8652060	8655780	I mean, thank you, what is the point, I never understood the point of DDR on a portable
8655780	8656780	platform.
8656780	8662540	Well, on the go, I mean, sometimes you can't, sometimes you don't have gaming on the go,
8662540	8666220	or you can't take your pad and such with you.
8666220	8670940	But here's the thing, though, is, before I remember talking to a Konami rep one time
8670940	8675180	about if, when they were planning on bringing over Guitar Freaks, and this was like a long
8675180	8681460	time ago, and they're like, well, unfortunately they don't know how to, you know, they don't
8681460	8687940	know how to market a guitar game for the US, you know, whereas like a DJing game, oh, people
8687940	8691460	want to play, you know, DJing games, which I think would be totally opposite, you know,
8691460	8694060	who wouldn't want to be in like a rock band or something like that.
8694060	8699900	But that's the thing, is, if they have trouble figuring out how to market a guitar game,
8699900	8705100	you know, which is kind of a no-brainer nowadays, what makes people think, you know, what, I
8705100	8710300	don't think that they would think that a DDR game on a PSP would be a good idea, because
8710300	8714420	they can't go, oh, you can get exorcised, no you can't, because you're just playing
8714420	8719980	a little PSP game, but, I don't know, it would be kind of cool maybe like a BeatMania game
8719980	8720980	or something like that.
8720980	8721980	Yeah, right.
8721980	8727340	Yeah, there was a pump and a DMR on the PSP, but that also, but that tanked, as far as
8727340	8729380	I'm concerned.
8729380	8731060	Because what is the fucking point?
8731060	8736300	I mean, really, beating Groovy on the PSP, I don't know, maybe.
8736300	8739500	Oh, yes, beating Groovy, oh gosh.
8739500	8744540	I mean, beating Groovy had a lot of potential, I mean, I can understand why it's only five
8744540	8751060	buttons, but, I mean, whoever was behind beating Groovy just handled it really poorly, I mean,
8751060	8756300	the songs are too easy, they went out of their way to replace all the awesome pop and music
8756300	8758300	characters, and...
8758300	8764200	God, you are so right, that's what's so frustrating about beating Groovy, is that beating Groovy
8764200	8768020	did have a lot of potential to be a really awesome game, and, oh wait, they already have
8768020	8772420	that game, it's called pop and music, and it's, like, superior in every way, and it's
8772420	8773420	just insulting.
8773420	8778620	Like, what Konami did with beating Groovy is insulting to us people that have been supporting
8778620	8779620	them for so many years.
8779620	8781740	I'm sorry, there's really no other way to describe it.
8781740	8785820	Well, I mean, I can understand the rationale behind the five button mode, but, like, the
8785820	8790580	lack of song listening and such, I mean, hell, look at the US version of BeatMania, that
8790580	8797860	had, like, at least 30 songs ranging from really easy to really hard, and, aside from
8797860	8803620	that five key beat medium mode, I mean, did it, and the new difficulty system, and the
8803620	8809300	gray system, which, isn't that really big of a deal, I mean, at least it's pretty faithful,
8809300	8814940	like, as far as the basics go, whereas beating Groovy, like, what the fuck is this?
8814940	8818340	Alright, uh, GSCCA, we're gonna let you go, so we can get some more calls, but thank you
8818340	8822900	for the review of, uh, DJMaxx, uh, Technica, and, uh, I definitely will be going to the
8822900	8825060	Bay Area at some point to check it out, I promise.
8825060	8826060	Let me know.
8826060	8829820	As soon as next weekend, I, I have, uh, stuff going on in South Bay next weekend anyway,
8829820	8830820	I might swing by.
8830820	8831820	Alright.
8831820	8832820	I don't know, though.
8832820	8836540	I'm living on Twitter, I have, I have free time all next week anyways.
8836540	8839760	The problem is, I have to take my female friend with me who thinks video games are stupid,
8839760	8842260	so I don't know how I'm gonna entertain her, but we'll think of something.
8842260	8843260	Oh, alright then.
8843260	8844260	Alright.
8844260	8845260	Alright, see ya.
8845260	8846260	Bye.
8846260	8849420	Alright, yeah, you know, I think I've made it no secret on the show, I do Rocky Horror
8849420	8853820	Picture Show still in the Bay, and I do stuff on stage and stuff, um, and I'm, I'm signed
8853820	8858940	up to this show in the South Bay next week, so I'll probably go, but, um, yeah, my friend
8858940	8861180	that goes with me doesn't, doesn't get the video game thing.
8861180	8863380	Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8863380	8867020	I have returned to spam up the airwaves even more.
8867020	8869260	Please do, Jason, what's on your mind?
8869260	8871460	Yes, I, I wanted to talk about something earlier.
8871460	8875580	I don't even remember what it was, but something else just hit me, so I'll kill time with that.
8875580	8876580	Sure.
8876580	8881060	Is it just me, or was this a year of classical throwbacks?
8881060	8885260	Well, yeah, look at, look at what game topped our list.
8885260	8889620	I mean, if we didn't put anything on the list, Mega Man 9 would have won amongst the listeners,
8889620	8890620	hands down.
8890620	8891620	Hands down.
8891620	8896540	That's a pretty good definitive pick, and that is what I mean, it's, uh, I was basically
8896540	8901120	just going to elaborate and say, sure, years back, Nintendo has resold their whole catalog,
8901120	8902120	but that doesn't mean anything.
8902120	8906300	This is the year of Mega Man 9, Braid, and I had another example.
8906300	8912060	Is it gaming, or is it Capcom, because, you know, the biggest ones I think of, Mega Man
8912060	8918700	9, Bionic Commando Rearmed, which was pretty damn impressive, and, uh, Super Street Fighter,
8918700	8923620	Turbo HD, Remix, Super, Uber, I can't believe I paid $10 for this version.
8923620	8927420	The movie, the game, anniversary, third style?
8927420	8929420	Yes.
8929420	8934260	I mean, Capcom was one of the biggest offenders, quote unquote, in this category, but at the
8934260	8938220	same time, I think Capcom finally started doing the games this year, but we wanted them
8938220	8944220	to do these downloadable games when they first came out, in a way.
8944220	8949420	But also, you know, a game like LittleBigPlanet, what's the first thing people do in LittleBigPlanet's
8949420	8950420	level creator?
8950420	8953980	Remake World 1-1 for Mario Brothers, yes, make Mario a LittleBigPlanet.
8953980	8955900	I was going to say porn.
8955900	8957500	Or porn, but you know what I mean?
8957500	8958620	They'll make the cock level.
8958620	8964300	A large majority of those levels are, you know, remakes of other games from another
8964300	8966400	day, in this newer engine.
8966400	8970180	So there definitely is a big retro vibe going on in 08.
8970180	8974060	I don't know if you guys have gone back and actually watched it, or actually looked for
8974060	8978220	it, but you remember the Gradius level that the Japanese guy made?
8978220	8979220	Yes.
8979220	8981260	Everybody was talking about.
8981260	8986120	Just in case I just referred to it by name, the level name was Libidus.jp.
8986120	8989700	He has made SuperLibidus.jp.
8989700	8992140	It is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up.
8992140	8994540	Oh, I'm going to have to check his levels.
8994540	8998620	I haven't looked at a while, but that guy did some amazing shit in LittleBigPlanet.
8998620	9004380	It's interesting because he has, yeah he did, all of the beatmania type level, and no, not
9004380	9005380	a math level.
9005380	9006380	Anyways.
9006380	9011460	There was another new one, I think it was supposed to be based off some Japanese shooter,
9011460	9012740	but I didn't understand it.
9012740	9018300	But now that they've given an actual paint gun, I'm curious to see what he does next.
9018300	9019300	You know what I mean?
9019300	9021680	All the shots are just hard anymore now that you have the paint gun.
9021680	9025560	That's a huge extra mechanic they've put in the game.
9025560	9030300	The only thing that I don't like about this SuperLibidus is that at the same time it adds
9030300	9037700	a very interesting twist, but if you're getting shot at, and you shoot that bullet, the two
9037700	9042560	bullets bounce off and fly in the other direction, and fly in opposite directions.
9042560	9044380	And like I said, it's a vertical scroller.
9044380	9049380	He has this, if you think of really, really old vertical shoot-em-ups, he has a crosshair
9049380	9053460	that's not even a quarter of the way up the screen permanently fixed right in front of
9053460	9055060	your ship.
9055060	9060100	There are ground quote-unquote enemies shooting at you that you can't destroy.
9060100	9061100	What was that game?
9061100	9064900	There was a game on the NES that had that, was it Xanax, Xevious?
9064900	9067060	You had that crosshair permanently fixed.
9067060	9069060	You might be thinking Zaxxon.
9069060	9070060	No not Zaxxon.
9070060	9071060	It was Xevious.
9071060	9072860	It was Xevious with the little blue landers.
9072860	9073860	Was it Xevious?
9073860	9074860	I think so.
9074860	9076260	Because that target showed you where the bombs would drop.
9076260	9077260	Yeah.
9077260	9078260	Yeah, that's what it was.
9078260	9079260	That's pretty sure.
9079260	9083260	If you were describing it, I thought it was Xevious.
9083260	9086500	There might be a bomb button that I just haven't found yet.
9086500	9091220	Just like Libidus, I died very quickly and sucked really hard.
9091220	9093220	Nice.
9093220	9097680	And it made me laugh a lot, because when you lose the level, just like in Libidus, you have
9097680	9103140	a little halfpipe with all of your orbs, depending on how far you got, but there's a key in there.
9103140	9106100	And when you do it and leave the level, guess what you get?
9106100	9107500	A new level with a key?
9107500	9109360	Super Libidus easy mode!
9109360	9112540	You fail so hard, you get a key just like in Devil May Cry.
9112540	9113540	Nice.
9113540	9117340	I got to cry all over again at the worst insult a game could ever hand me.
9117340	9119140	I really need to get in there and make a level.
9119140	9121480	I need to tear myself away from WoW long enough, Jason.
9121480	9124680	How do I do it?
9124680	9125680	Close your laptop.
9125680	9130000	No, you play on desktops, what am I thinking?
9130000	9132140	Kick the monitor.
9132140	9133140	Break it.
9133140	9134140	I don't know.
9134140	9136140	If I break the monitor, then I don't have one for the show.
9136140	9140420	Being the fact that I've never been much of a WoW person, I can't offer, an MMO person
9140420	9141980	rather, I can't really offer much advice.
9141980	9142980	That's all right.
9142980	9143980	I'll get to it someday.
9143980	9146580	I do have a lot of fun when I play a little bit of Planet, I'll get to a level at some
9146580	9147580	point.
9147580	9149740	All right, well, Jason, we're going to let you go to try and get a couple more calls,
9149740	9153420	and we have to read the list list results and see if you're suggesting me the top three.
9153420	9158380	You guys have better voted me in, at least number two, I can respect a certain one for
9158380	9159380	number one.
9159380	9160380	We're about to find out in two seconds.
9160380	9161380	All right, see you, Jason.
9161380	9162380	All right, folks.
9162380	9172620	Our fearless webmaster, Jason, VXJsonXV, Jason for short.
9172620	9175060	Let's talk about the winners, shall we, of list list.
9175060	9177220	Don't worry, we'll get back to the phone and do a couple more calls.
9177220	9181260	Let's get to the top three based on your votes.
9181260	9186380	Hold on, I have to add it up here so I don't read it wrong.
9186380	9189700	Okay, there is definitely a very definitive top three tonight.
9189700	9191380	No ties, no nothing.
9191380	9193540	Very easy top three spelled out here tonight.
9193540	9196780	The number three top news story of 2008.
9196780	9200300	Actually, I'm curious.
9200300	9204420	Folks here in studio, provided you didn't look over my shoulder, any predictions on
9204420	9206860	what they thought was the number one story of 2008?
9206860	9207860	Cookie.
9207860	9208860	Cookie.
9208860	9210860	I don't think that was on the list, DarkSucker.
9210860	9217860	I'd say either our 300th episode just because they're kissing ass, or guitar hero.
9217860	9218860	All right.
9218860	9219860	Bradley?
9219860	9220860	Any thoughts?
9220860	9221860	No?
9221860	9222860	Or.
9222860	9223860	Or.
9223860	9224860	All right, let's see.
9224860	9225860	Let's see.
9225860	9230260	All right, the number three biggest story of 2008.
9230260	9231260	This is definitive.
9231260	9232260	This is absolute.
9232260	9233260	There is no arguing.
9233260	9235540	This is a flawless process.
9235540	9240380	Jack Thompson getting the beat down was the number three pick for the biggest story of
9240380	9241380	2008.
9241380	9242380	Oh, I'm sorry.
9242380	9243380	I said his name out loud.
9243380	9244380	That just gives him power.
9244380	9245380	Sorry.
9245380	9247500	Oh, but not in the state of Florida.
9247500	9252340	The number two biggest story of 2008 in gaming.
9252340	9256340	The new Xbox experience brings us community games and Netflix.
9256340	9258540	There you go.
9258540	9265300	And lastly, the top story of 2008, the biggest story in gaming.
9265300	9272260	Orange Lounge Radio hits 300 episodes in six years, you narcissistic bastards.
9272260	9275900	Hey, it is monumental.
9275900	9283220	Like I said, we are that full of ourselves.
9283220	9287900	I just love that the chat, you know, it just goes to show our live listeners and the podcast
9287900	9293020	listeners too, the whole family here at OLR, everybody that helps make this show a success.
9293020	9300580	Everybody has to spank their monkey that sometimes everybody contributes to that in one way or
9300580	9301580	another.
9301580	9302580	All right.
9302580	9305820	Oh, Jason's going apeshit in the chat room and not letting people talk because they didn't
9305820	9309260	vote his as a top three.
9309260	9312620	I will say though, Jason, yours to get some votes.
9312620	9317580	It would have come in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
9317580	9318580	No sixth.
9318580	9325860	It would have come in sixth out of the list, so there you go, Jason.
9325860	9326860	Very rude.
9326860	9327940	All right.
9327940	9330700	It's rude to silence those who disagree with you.
9330700	9332700	All right.
9332700	9336500	Let's do another call.
9336500	9341480	Orange Lounge Radio's username on Skype, 1877 game OLR is the number to call.
9341480	9344120	We'll do like one more call then we will wrap up.
9344120	9346340	For live listeners, no afterbirth tonight.
9346340	9347340	Sorry, guys.
9347340	9350500	We have a late start, so we have jobs to get to tomorrow.
9350500	9357140	We're already well after midnight on the East Coast, so we're not going to do an afterbirth
9357140	9360540	tonight, but do stay tuned because I do have a special message for you after the show just
9360540	9361540	for the live folks.
9361540	9363020	Let's get to one more call.
9363020	9364020	Hi.
9364020	9365020	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9365020	9366020	Who's this?
9366020	9367020	You know, Legend of Zaku.
9367020	9368020	Legend of Zaku.
9368020	9370820	What's on your mind?
9370820	9371820	Nothing much.
9371820	9377220	Just gloating, just looking back at what was once this year and in the next few days we'll
9377220	9378620	be the next year.
9378620	9379620	Yeah.
9379620	9383180	This year has gone by really fast.
9383180	9384740	Shit happened really quickly.
9384740	9387640	What do you think of the list of the biggest stories of 2008?
9387640	9390620	Was there something else you would have put on that?
9390620	9394020	I guess it was pretty much concise of what happened.
9394020	9398540	Guess Jack Thompson's disbarring should have been up there pretty high.
9398540	9403740	I wouldn't say number one, but it should have been an honorable mention at least.
9403740	9409180	With all respect to Dark Sakura and for putting that on the list originally, in my world,
9409180	9410900	I hate talking about him.
9410900	9411900	Totally.
9411900	9412900	I don't want that anymore.
9412900	9416580	I don't like that being anywhere near the top stories just because I feel like the more
9416580	9418780	we talk about him, the more strength he gains.
9418780	9421100	But he has no strength to begin with.
9421100	9423460	He has no legal power anymore.
9423460	9425900	True, true, but he just sucks.
9425900	9429140	There's still a story about him this week and I didn't even know he would have been
9429140	9430140	there.
9430140	9431140	Don't go away.
9431140	9432140	Yeah, he won't.
9432140	9433140	Make it stop.
9433140	9434740	People will keep talking about him.
9434740	9437780	Game politics, I'm looking at you, yeah?
9437780	9439540	Keep talking about him.
9439540	9447700	Besides that, obviously Final Fantasy 13 on the 360, that was the biggest.
9447700	9452380	That right there would have been the big summer surprise right there.
9452380	9455320	Funny how quickly we all forgot about that one, huh?
9455320	9458740	I think for me though, the reason why that missed my list is that's something I've kind
9458740	9463620	of come to expect at this point in the year, is that most things are on all the platforms
9463620	9464620	now.
9464620	9467100	I mean, you've kind of heard, I think Capcom.
9467100	9469260	It was unprecedented when it was announced.
9469260	9474900	It was almost like jaw-dropping that it came out of nowhere.
9474900	9478340	I think at some point during this year, Capcom came out and said, look, the only way we're
9478340	9482220	going to make our money back is to put our games out on all the platforms.
9482220	9487660	And ever since then, in my opinion, this news has not been as shocking.
9487660	9488660	But that's just me.
9488660	9497540	When Square dropped that bombshell over E3, that was a critical blow to the PS3's exclusivity.
9497540	9503100	The only thing they have now is Metal Gear Solid 4 and first-party exclusives.
9503100	9508840	So it pretty much gives people less of a reason to get a PS3 in the first place, since there's
9508840	9516700	no big-ticket games exclusive for their system, aside from the ones made by Sony themselves.
9516700	9523260	So it's like, why should I get Final Fantasy 13 when I could get it for my 360 easily and
9523260	9527300	rack up on the achievements and whatever other features they may have?
9527300	9528580	Because the controller sucks?
9528580	9529580	I don't know.
9529580	9533140	But yeah, you see the argument I'm trying to make, right?
9533140	9534140	No, I do.
9534140	9535140	I do.
9535140	9536140	It was huge.
9536140	9537140	It was huge.
9537140	9538140	And Hitstun agrees with you in chat.
9538140	9542060	The FF13 announcement was the top story of the year, no doubt.
9542060	9550900	Where I could pull it off in terms of making that 360 version on the same level as the
9550900	9560220	PS3, then they'll be raking in shitloads of money because of the tens of millions of users
9560220	9563520	that make up the 360's install base.
9563520	9571100	So it's like, in that way, they see a bigger picture in terms of how much money they're
9571100	9572820	willing to make.
9572820	9576180	Everything else, every loyalty be damned.
9576180	9577180	Yeah.
9577180	9581980	All right, well, Zaku, any other quick thoughts before I let you go and try to wrap up the
9581980	9582980	show?
9582980	9589420	Steam and their sale this week, please, please get Bioshock for five bucks.
9589420	9590860	You won't be disappointed.
9590860	9596140	Might as well go to Steam right now and just get your cheap-ass games.
9596140	9597140	All right.
9597140	9598460	I know all of us have the ability.
9598460	9599460	Let's go.
9599460	9600460	All right.
9600460	9602900	Let's go for Bioshock here before we close out the Skypline.
9602900	9604700	Zaku, have a good one.
9604700	9605700	Have a good one.
9605700	9607860	Have a good, you know, new year.
9607860	9608860	Happy new year.
9608860	9609860	Mm-hmm.
9609860	9610860	All right.
9610860	9618460	All right, we are going to try to wrap it up here and close up shop for the night.
9618460	9621980	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
9621980	9626140	Remember, hey, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about Orange Lounge
9626140	9631420	Radio because word of mouth is really the biggest way for us to spread word about the
9631420	9632420	show.
9632420	9635180	So we would really, really appreciate that.
9635180	9637420	All right.
9637420	9639860	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9639860	9644060	DarkSakura, your final thought for this last OLR of 2008.
9644060	9645060	Reject false icons.
9645060	9646060	Mm, well said.
9646060	9650900	Loki, PayPal is awesome to dump these stupid little gift cards that I have left with like
9650900	9654940	five dollars on each one of them and I can't really spend them in one place.
9654940	9656900	It says donate the money to myself.
9656900	9657900	Nice.
9657900	9659900	How did you donate money to yourself?
9659900	9665660	I created a donate link for myself and paid a credit card.
9665660	9666660	Nice.
9666660	9673300	Arkadian42, Bradley, whatever your name is, what, no, thank you for being here.
9673300	9676540	And what is your final thought?
9676540	9679780	My new year's resolution to play the games I bought this year.
9679780	9680780	All right.
9680780	9684140	Me too.
9684140	9687460	My final thought for this, the last show of 2008.
9687460	9693620	Kids, your pancreas is a much more important organ than you might have thought before.
9693620	9694620	Just so you know.
9694620	9695620	All right.
9695620	9697900	That's going to do it.
9697900	9701140	Thank you guys once again for supporting us throughout 2008.
9701140	9703340	Will you come back and do it again in 2009?
9703340	9704340	Maybe.
9704340	9705340	Sure.
9705340	9706340	What the hell.
9706340	9707340	All right.
9707340	9708340	See you next year.
