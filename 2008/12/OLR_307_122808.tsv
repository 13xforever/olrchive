14312	22056	I, December 28, 2008, Capulorasa goes free, Konami files another music game lawsuit, and we look back at the highlights.
32153	33593	Merry Christmas, everybody!
34174	35134	It's too late for that.
35234	35634	Oh, whoops.
35674	37294	Well, just a preemptive one for 2009.
37334	39435	Hey, you're listening to... It's still Kwanzaa!
39915	40415	That's true.
40875	42096	Merry Kwanzaa, everybody!
42816	43976	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
43996	49278	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
49338	52579	And we are here live here on All Games Radio on this lovely December the 28th.
54360	58805	2008, talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
58845	59866	My name is Rob Roberts.
59926	63269	Joining us as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
63630	64451	I'm sad, Rob.
64671	65392	Why are you sad?
65572	67394	It's the last show of the year.
67782	71065	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
89397	91498	We were just kind of chilling and it kept going and going.
91518	92598	So we were like, oh, let's take a cat nap.
92758	94359	I fell into a Indian food coma.
94659	97360	But then our chat room was getting restless.
97820	99441	As they might say overseas, rude.
99621	100441	A little bit rude.
105632	107834	Better rude than Randy What about Loki?
127015	127976	I don't want to talk to you anyways.
128056	130697	I'm sure he'd make his presence known at some point anyway.
130717	132418	I haven't gone into the gaming weeks yet.
134860	138181	If I'd gone into gaming weeks and still forgot Loki, then you could yell at me.
138882	144705	Rob, don't you know that the first rule of parenting is maintain a schedule and an order?
144845	145726	Am I your daddy?
147587	148087	Oh, baby.
150166	154610	Also say hello to the one and only Arcadian42 is joining us tonight.
155031	157593	Straight from the ultra-sensitive mics.
157873	160255	Yes, the ultra-sensitive mic.
160275	162517	I just wanted to come and bother you for a show.
162818	163438	No, please do.
163458	164439	You know, it was funny.
164479	167502	I had a bunch of people sending me private messages before the show began tonight.
167802	168362	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
192915	194255	We've decided, though, what your special power is.
194315	195776	It's the ability to show up at any party and still be there.
195796	196356	Playing pinball.
215939	220161	Just sit in the corner and use... Is that... Don't notice me until... No, it's like... Oh, he's over there.
220421	223342	No, it's like... And we have no problem with this.
223382	224043	We just think it's funny.
225043	227024	Dan and I were talking about last time you were at one of our parties.
228604	236169	and we were just wandering around the house and people were starting to head off and nothing's going on in the garage, at least so we think.
236229	239091	We go into the garage and there he is playing.
239171	241673	You're turning the light out and you hear this voice.
241733	242734	It was about to.
244855	250539	And all of a sudden I hear like sound effects from, oh God, what machines do we have in there right now?
250579	251299	Indiana Jones?
251820	253100	No, we were fixing that one.
253421	254862	But it was just hearing sound effects.
254882	256002	I was like, what the crap?
256203	256623	Oh, hi.
256643	256683	Hi.
257930	259390	I have nowhere to go.
284594	285635	Okay, TinyRob.
285796	289179	Alright, let's go to... Hey, it's not the size, it's how you use it.
289219	291081	Let's get into your gaming week.
291141	293584	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
294705	295466	Semi-eventful.
297014	297855	I played stuff.
298736	300538	I started Ragnarok Online DS.
301018	302720	And I was like, ooh, Ragnarok!
303280	307224	Talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking.
307705	309787	Wow, I read like a Japanese five-year-old.
310007	312530	Talking and talking and talking and talking and talking.
313050	314251	Finally, action!
314672	315833	We're gonna fall off a cliff!
317074	318355	Shit, we landed on this guy!
319583	320544	Let's talk to him!
342011	343172	Talk to me!
343312	348754	So, I forgot his name, but like, I was like, text in blue, I can read it!
349414	350435	And it was named one of the towns.
351075	351975	I was like, okay, good.
352736	355937	All the towns are gonna be written in katakana, and I can read that shit!
356517	357218	I know where to go!
358178	364521	So, and it was, it actually, when it goes through big dialogue scenes, it has you saved periodically.
365021	367722	So, I've saved, and I've done my stats too.
368502	374425	So, I at least remember that all my stats are in the same place, because I recognize the kanji for strength.
375285	377046	And so I was like, well, strength is always the first one.
377326	381528	So maybe the next one is agility, and the next one is intelligence, and blah, blah, blah, blah.
381748	381848	So...
382247	382707	Simon's Quest
409850	411771	What a horrible night for a curse.
413152	423158	And so, so anyway, so anyway, I also, I went with my friend Becky and we got her husband an Xbox 360, well she did that technically.
423418	430102	She got the family their Christmas present of an Xbox 360 and she gave him a Big Fat Gift Certificate to GameStop.
430902	439948	And I was like, well, if you were going to actually pick out games for him, you should get him Fallout 3 and Fable 2 and the Orange Box.
440148	441809	So guess what he picked up with his gift certificate?
443070	443430	All of them.
443590	443810	Yes.
444571	444851	Awesome.
445874	446555	Oh, hell yeah.
447115	448376	So anyway, so it was funny.
448396	451298	So I actually got to see some of Fallout 3, and I thought it was pretty cool.
451959	454901	I didn't play any, because those games make me freaking nauseated as hell.
454981	456962	Did you get to hit the button that makes the baby talk?
456982	457643	Like, that's the one thing.
457683	467790	I haven't really played Fallout 3 yet, but I was listening to Bobby talk about it on the last show, when they were talking about the, I don't remember what it was, but he was talking about slamming on the button that makes the baby talk, and I'm like, wow, that sounds kind of awesome.
467810	468651	That could be the best game ever.
468671	469512	He was already past it.
469732	470052	Oh, okay.
470112	475096	And I played some Animal Crossing so that I could harass Jingle, who I think is on crack.
475618	477699	Oh shit, I forgot about holidays in Animal Crossing.
477719	483681	Because he has the starry eyes, and I think that it really means that Jingle is on crack so he won't sleep at all that night.
484261	486962	So it's like, here's your presents, kids!
488502	491864	And I downloaded something on my phone.
492324	492704	What's that?
493171	493911	Well, two things.
494011	499853	First of all was the 8,000 cocktail drink mixing guide for free.
500314	507316	Hey, we're having our New Year's party at Julie's house and I need to be drunk because it's Julie's house.
508577	510957	Sorry.
511037	512278	No offense to Julie if you listen.
512298	514919	Intoxicated enough to actually sing karaoke.
516039	516299	I see.
516319	517880	We will have special guests.
520049	523070	who will be here for this party, namely Sauce.
524310	525131	Oh, is she coming to town?
525791	530853	No, she's actually going to teleport in and show up just for five seconds that night and leave.
531393	532213	Yes, she's coming.
533033	535634	All right, I think I'll see you at Gaming Week before I smack you.
537055	537815	I did play other stuff.
537855	538675	I played Riding Rock Online.
539155	539596	The real thing.
539656	540076	The real one.
540956	541736	The real one for free.
542497	549359	And someone gave me a mistress card for Christmas and I was like, ooh, mistress card.
549679	550980	Is that like a business card?
551300	555962	No, Mistress is the stupid bee that I hate.
557143	566227	She's one of the MVP things and then you get a card that makes you not have to use gems to cast stuff which is helpful and useful.
566868	568128	Only I forgot to put it in something.
568689	576012	So I got that and I played with the City of Heroes character creator a lot.
576453	577013	The Korean one.
577373	578314	Here's the best part of the game.
579074	581295	That's why I have the Korean character creators.
581355	582495	I don't have the whole game yet.
582676	583556	But I'm thinking about playing it.
583816	584656	I'm thinking about playing it.
585297	587118	Because I was really thinking about it.
587138	591360	I was like, dude, why would I even remotely want to play World of Warcraft again?
592200	594441	Because I was just like looking at different stuff.
594501	595902	I was like, dude, I don't want to play it anymore.
596482	598143	So I'm kind of waffling again.
598283	603105	So that's really it for my gaming week.
603405	604785	Let me read some chat comments.
605125	609727	You can always join our chat room, chat.orangelongeradio.com, and we always like to read your comments throughout the program.
610807	629552	GS68 comments on both you and I have said things about the level of difficulty in the Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game, and I don't know if it's just because we suck at games now that we've gotten older or the game really is kind of a step harder, but GS68's thought is at least Ecclesia is think on your feet hard, not stupid hard like Circle of the Moon.
630276	636866	Yeah, well, this is what I've noticed is I've actually got pretty good reaction time through the forest.
636906	640391	It's just I sped through the first level.
640752	642374	I really just sped through it.
643096	644618	And I think that
646149	650311	I would probably do better with about another level's worth of life, and then I can get through it.
650652	655594	Because it's like this one place that I always end up getting smacked around at.
655694	666000	Since you didn't get your time, gaining experience points, so... So I'm going to go back and... And we have an offer from Xenocor in chat, who's on the Justice server in City of Heroes, if you ever need help.
666841	667961	Well, thank you kindly, sir.
667981	669582	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
670283	670923	It was okay.
671683	672244	I played...
673553	681305	More this idea of the new Final Fantasy, I don't even know if you want to call it a fighting game.
682547	685011	To me, it's very similar to Crisis Core a bit.
685552	688156	Because Crisis Core, if you've ever played it, is...
688837	689357	Thanks for watching!
704048	706449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
732881	735044	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
753193	755455	And it's okay, I guess.
756235	757356	I was kind of bored with it.
757676	760798	I tried making a character look like myself, and then that didn't work.
760918	763640	So the next best thing was I made a creepy Santa Claus.
764501	774487	And I had to, you know, first I was just trying to find clothes that looked like the Santa Claus clothes, and then I realized that they actually sold the Santa Claus clothes, so I had to buy those.
776269	778710	Wait, wait, wait, stop, hold on.
779010	780411	You bought something at home?
780712	781572	Yeah.
781672	782373	Get off the show.
784720	789236	I am laughing you off of this program you spent money on that
790287	792268	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
817546	826931	And the thing about it is, I had knocked the PlayStation Network before because I hated the way you put money on your account and you have to spend so much.
827191	837617	Actually, I found out, if you are buying items that are under $5, then yes, you can only put in the minimum of $5 on your account.
838037	843540	If you're purchasing stuff over $5 in total, what will happen is, say if you have like
843920	846941	I played around with Home for a little bit and it was a complete waste of time.
846981	847301	I don't get
874207	875407	What the purpose of all this is.
875427	877068	But at least you look like Santa Claus.
877128	877708	So hooray for that.
877728	879209	Yes, at least I look like Santa Claus.
879489	881229	And, you know, big deal.
881349	884351	But I'm going to still wear the Santa Claus costume forever.
884791	886211	You know, I'm not buying any more clothes.
886251	886591	That's it.
886751	887932	I'm Santa Claus forever now.
888012	888472	Even in June.
888812	889372	Even in June.
889932	890333	That's fine.
892113	893334	So, yeah, it was quite boring.
893574	894854	And the loading is annoying.
895634	899376	I've got to say some comments from chat because they're too good.
899416	901696	Hanukkah Harry in chat says, What the fuck, Loki?
901716	903177	You might as well buy Eye of Judgment.
904585	905506	No, I'm not buying that.
905566	906166	I have judgment.
906267	910249	Trishlicious in chat says, I wish I had a PlayStation 3, then I could be exploring home now.
910770	914752	Honestly, Trish, I used to feel that same way like six months ago.
915253	916513	You're not missing much, honestly.
916774	917574	It's still in beta.
917654	918055	It's early.
918635	921797	I think home's going to be a lot better in a year, but that'll be a year.
922357	923458	I do have to give them credit, though.
923999	930123	The video integration in it, like the actual little video screens and stuff, that's actually pretty cool, and it's pretty seamless.
930523	930623	Yeah.
931201	933364	But at the same time, it's kind of annoying.
933585	938111	And it's also annoying how much stuff is being censored in there.
938311	940394	Like, everything's being censored, and it's really annoying.
942352	943313	Okay, so enough with home.
943953	949276	The other thing I downloaded on the PlayStation Network this week was the new Metal Gear Solid pack for LittleBigPlanet.
949837	951878	And holy crap, does that change the game.
951958	957822	It really, first of all, the pack itself contains like five levels, and I think a challenge level.
958522	959843	And they're great levels.
959863	964586	I mean, it's the same kind of quality as the in-game story levels, and they're awesome.
965467	968409	I like it, though, because the whole premise of the levels is that you're...
969864	976369	basically going to try to stop Liquid's device for creating trophy levels.
977010	978431	It's a machine that creates trophy levels.
978671	979091	Genius.
979351	979972	Pure genius.
980052	984095	I love the way that Media Molecule played on some of the current controversies.
984115	987057	The only thing that would have been even better was a joke about moderation.
988098	988458	Somehow.
989539	992562	But I love that they actually made fun of the whole trophy whoring levels.
992682	993943	That was great.
994683	998066	But the actual new weapon, like the Paininator in it,
998885	999565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1020760	1029726	and unless they hit a roadblock of something that they really want to add that they can't do in LittleBigPlanet, then they'll do a LittleBigPlanet 2.
1029886	1034089	But for right now, they're just going to keep doing download packs because they're selling really well.
1035010	1035950	So that's kind of cool.
1036210	1044376	Now just to clarify though, you don't have to buy this Metal Gear Solid add-on to get to use the Paintinator because it'll show up in other people's levels, right?
1044396	1045056	Yes, that's right.
1045316	1046057	That's kind of neat.
1046820	1047620	Thanks for watching!
1068092	1070232	I was playing some more of the levels on there.
1070272	1071753	They're really cool.
1072073	1073053	The paint there is fun.
1073413	1078174	Someone actually made a level that was like a tank that had three different weapons and stuff on there.
1078254	1080814	That was kind of neat.
1080854	1084635	Some of the stuff that they do in the Metal Gear Solid levels are just amazing.
1084695	1093937	They actually have one level that you have to sneak and avoid these spotlights because if not, then you die because all these explosions come.
1095177	1096177	The last boss in the game...
1096857	1097398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1120420	1123682	Arcadian42, Bradley Surd, the chatty one tonight.
1124222	1128484	I saw you haul a DS in here and you were kind of playing DS while we had a little bit of downtime a little bit ago.
1128504	1130845	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
1131705	1136707	Most of this week I was not playing anything because I was at home on the other coast doing Christmas stuff.
1137188	1140229	But what I've been playing recently is My Japanese Coach.
1140349	1141229	Wait, where is home?
1141309	1143670	Because we might have some listeners there that want to go, Woo!
1144051	1145131	Greenville, South Carolina.
1145251	1145771	Woo!
1146031	1146272	Alright.
1147734	1149777	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1161465	1162346	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1179861	1184025	and they were going back to England for a week for someone's funeral or something.
1184725	1185786	It was kind of fun to listen to them.
1189129	1194935	Sorry, I don't mean to laugh, but I'm just trying to picture what must have been so fascinating about this conversation.
1195455	1195875	Never mind.
1196276	1196776	Another show.
1197277	1198218	My Japanese coach.
1199639	1206345	I'm basically reviewing what I've learned before for the most part and learning a little bit enough to get through that.
1207122	1231514	and it's actually pretty good for learning new stuff and I think there's maybe the only limitation if you're like a newer user would be or a newer person learning Japanese would be that it kind of glosses a little bit over the learning sentences and so on but it's good on like repetition of words and so on which is if you're just reviewing the first like the first 30 or 40 lessons it's
1232432	1238638	It's a little bit tedious because it takes a while because you have to repeat games and stuff to get to the next lesson.
1239159	1240560	Do you actually have to talk into it?
1241001	1242563	No, you don't have to talk.
1242963	1244945	There is a thing you can actually compare.
1245986	1252693	You can speak into the mic and then you don't repeat it back and you can kind of compare it to the actual Japanese speaker that's in the game.
1253601	1255503	so that you can learn that stuff.
1255703	1256184	That sounds neat.
1256204	1266393	Do you think somebody like me who doesn't know a lick of Japanese yet tries to pronounce the Japanese release dates here on Orange Lodge Radio and gets teased for it every other week, do you think I might have some benefit to play this game?
1266654	1268315	Yeah, it would be pretty good.
1268455	1269236	I might have to check it out.
1269396	1272099	Yeah, and then you can learn the Hiragana and Katakana and
1272782	1273823	And of course, it takes a long time.
1274083	1276565	The economy is not until like less than 40 or something.
1276745	1280288	Although Jamie did admit a few weeks ago, I've gotten better in the years I've been doing it.
1280328	1281168	Your past got quite a bit better.
1281208	1281929	I've gotten better.
1282029	1284010	So when in doubt, crash and burn your way through it.
1285151	1285832	Arigato.
1286312	1292516	Yeah, because basically when I've been listening to the podcast, trying to catch up, which I'm still like 30 behind.
1292797	1294238	I'm actually thinking about getting that though.
1294258	1295459	Oh man, come on, you could say that better.
1295699	1296499	With the Japanese coach?
1296860	1297100	Yeah.
1297220	1297380	Yeah.
1298318	1305062	I have a couple of friends that live in Japan that I want to visit, but I also have people I know in England that I want to visit, so I have to think.
1305562	1308203	See, if I really wanted to learn Japanese, what I would do is get Jamie a device.
1308223	1309184	I am not a scroll!
1309244	1311465	Where every time I mispronounce a word, she shocks me.
1311865	1316928	But the problem is that she would use that device for things other than its intended purpose, so I don't allow her to have this device.
1316988	1318729	Hanukkah Harry said I was a scroll.
1320000	1321121	I'm not a Skrull!
1321621	1322842	Let Bradley finish his gaming week.
1323122	1330328	Okay, I'll go a little bit farther than this week, because other than this, it's been a while since I've been here.
1331409	1339975	The other things I've been playing is Castlevania Lament of Innocence, which, even though I heard people saying it was bad or something, it's actually a pretty good game.
1340616	1348942	Other than the camera issues, which you can't see half the time, because it's looking in the other direction from the actual degree of movement, it's actually pretty enjoyable, and
1349620	1350822	The voice acting is really good.
1352304	1358292	And the other thing was Zelda Phantom Hourglass, which I still got a ways to go in.
1359273	1359954	That's a fun game.
1361195	1361516	All right.
1362092	1363613	I'm reading some other comments in the chat room.
1363673	1371458	Akuma JP says, commenting on my reading of the Japanese release dates, Skye sometimes get very good when he is in a good mood, but no idea when he is not in the mood.
1371738	1375660	So apparently if I'm in a good mood, I'll do better at reading the release dates.
1375680	1380683	So I'll try to smile before I read the dates tonight so I'm in a good mood, although I don't think we have a lot this week.
1383224	1387567	My gaming week, real quickly, because pretty much everything I wanted to talk about has already been talked about.
1389449	1393091	I've been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King, as you know, I'm addicted to MMOs.
1393411	1396253	But I would like to congratulate our guild for clearing Naxx.
1396534	1398875	That was pretty awesome, which is one of the big raids at the end.
1399256	1401717	We cleared 10-man Naxx this week, which is nice.
1402998	1404319	And the other thing I've been playing is...
1406438	1411481	The Metal Gear Solid expansion on the little big planet, which is amazing, and everybody should buy it.
1411782	1419286	Because not only does it come with the whole gun and things you can put in your own levels, I don't even design levels, but I just kind of wanted to see.
1419566	1427771	My thought was that probably Media Molecule designed some levels to unlock this stuff in, because I heard that you actually had to play these levels to unlock the stuff.
1427791	1432754	So you're basically getting, you know what, five or so new Media Molecule levels, and they are great.
1433715	1461839	and I realized I could go online and download a ton of other levels but there's something about having the official developer with official unlocks being able to play those levels and they are fantastic something Loki kind of neglected to mention is that not only can you run through them once but you can go back and you can play through these same levels again with new challenge elements on them you'll get stickers at the very end that you can go back and place at the very beginning and then suddenly the entire level becomes a race which makes some of those things like the stealth level and stuff become very interesting because you're trying to rush but not too much
1462099	1464300	I've actually gotten most of the trophies for the entire thing.
1464360	1470864	In fact, I think I have all the trophies except for the one beating the last boss under a certain time limit, but I have all the other trophies.
1471604	1474345	I don't think I've unlocked a single trophy yet, sadly.
1474465	1475686	I've aced all the levels.
1476226	1483310	I've gotten every single bit of collectible stuff in the game, or at least in those levels.
1483450	1487592	I'm missing like two stickers in one level that is bugging the hell out of me because I can't figure out where they are.
1487612	1489032	I know what you're talking about, the third level.
1489133	1489693	Yes, it is.
1490113	1490633	How do you know?
1491373	1491894	Where are they?
1492714	1493434	You tell me now.
1493674	1494695	All right, I'll tell you now.
1494755	1498877	You know that spot where you have to shoot the green thing so the platform's lower down?
1498937	1499077	Yeah.
1499775	1504999	Yeah, on the second one that lowers down, you walk through to the left, and there's a hallway that you can walk through.
1505019	1506019	Oh, shut up.
1506139	1506439	Really?
1506479	1508041	Yeah, it took me forever to figure that out.
1508161	1509201	That is so crazy.
1509421	1510962	I didn't even have to tell you what it is.
1511063	1513384	It's frustrating me, and I know exactly what you're talking about.
1513404	1514345	I'm like, nope, I haven't been there.
1514645	1514985	You're right.
1515065	1515706	That's what I'm missing.
1515746	1521510	Yeah, because I had to read the comments for the actual level, and there was questions about that in there, and that's where they said it was.
1521550	1524271	I was like, ah, because I knew just plain level.
1524291	1525492	I'm like, there's something down there.
1525512	1526653	I just don't know how to get down there.
1526673	1529655	The network was down the day I was trying to play, so I couldn't do that.
1529935	1530255	Interesting.
1530275	1533856	But I gotta say, honestly, if you have LittleBigPlanet, check out the expansion.
1533876	1534656	You won't be disappointed.
1534716	1539878	Even if you don't build levels, I think the five or so levels that come with it are... It's six bucks.
1540098	1540558	It's worth it.
1541058	1541498	It really is.
1542018	1546440	Okay, let's move on with tonight's show and try to get into some gaming news.
1546480	1547980	But first, some housekeeping tonight.
1548360	1551141	First off, we want to make sure everybody had a really wonderful holiday.
1552221	1557863	And just a quick reminder, although we didn't take off any shows for the holiday, we will not be here January...
1559783	1561365	January 11th, I believe is the day.
1561405	1563106	Yeah, January 11th, we will not be here.
1563226	1565768	So no yelling at Bobby if he goes long.
1565908	1566709	January 11th.
1566749	1568070	He can go till midnight if he wants.
1568270	1569191	I don't really care.
1571451	1572692	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1597646	1601287	So I know what all the Toda KK songs are called now.
1602327	1607648	And he got me these Kingdom Hearts promo cards that they had at his store.
1608609	1610409	I kind of wanted them, so he grabbed me some.
1610529	1620931	And I got the Silent Hill Homecoming soundtrack, which a lucky person is going to be receiving a copy as well, but I won't say anything more than that.
1622252	1622512	Ooh.
1622632	1622952	Ooh.
1626035	1627381	and Candy.
1628886	1630206	and I got a coat.
1631366	1632707	I have a funny story about my coat.
1632727	1635267	You remember the coat I was wearing last week?
1635767	1636467	Yes, I do.
1637147	1638788	Well, Becky and I were going shopping.
1639688	1640888	Did someone knock on the door?
1640908	1641048	No.
1641188	1641308	No.
1641608	1653310	We were going shopping and we saw these coats at this one retailer who I will not mention and we thought they were cute so we went in and it was marked down from $89 to $39 and they would buy one and get one half price.
1653790	1656711	So we just gifted each other coats and they were really cool.
1657271	1658012	Thanks for watching!
1674378	1675039	Aw, Loki.
1675499	1676219	You're the best.
1676279	1677400	Hey, no problem.
1678301	1678841	All right.
1679001	1679562	One other thing.
1679862	1680142	Oh, yeah?
1680382	1681323	I got Knights on Wii.
1682123	1682724	Oh, how's that?
1682844	1683884	Haven't opened it yet.
1684385	1694251	I didn't get any, like, games or anything, but Ranma did send me this shirt that says Companion Cube is my co-pilot, so thank you very much to Ranma who sent me that shirt, which I think is great.
1694431	1695012	It's very cute.
1695412	1696793	My shirt says, No, you cannot have...
1697313	1699635	and I'm being very scummy because I wore it yesterday too.
1699715	1704378	I'm doing that really gross thing where I wore the same shirt two days in a row because I was lazy today.
1704398	1706620	I didn't really leave the house, so whatevs.
1707220	1708361	Come on, you've all been there too.
1708641	1708921	Admit it.
1710792	1712253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1736188	1740690	But it all starts January 9th, and they are taping live at a computer arena in Atlanta.
1741271	1746753	And there's going to be other people on, and they're going to actually dissect game consoles and repair them live on air.
1746793	1748574	And it's actually kind of a multimedia thing.
1748614	1749595	It's not just a radio.
1749615	1750595	They're doing TV, too.
1750675	1752136	So it sounds pretty exciting.
1752176	1753136	I just sent them my broken 360.
1753837	1754877	Good luck fixing that one.
1754937	1759019	I think you have to take a number for that, because I think they already have lined up what they're doing for the first two shows.
1759520	1760660	No, I don't want it back.
1760720	1761601	They can just have it?
1764406	1765189	Maybe they'd take it.
1765229	1765510	I don't know.
1765630	1766252	I've talked to Bobby.
1767921	1768181	FNG Life.net
1795259	1797100	Yeah, unfortunately, it's not for our region, though.
1797680	1801301	But, you know, Japan... What happens in Japan might happen here, right?
1801382	1803562	Yeah, not so much, I don't think.
1804983	1814647	Basically, you know, Japan, they do a lot of things over there, especially with their WiiWare service and Nintendo and that kind of stuff, that we will probably never see over here.
1815787	1818789	For example, you know, they got, a while back, a...
1819989	1829777	I don't know if it was a couple WiiWare downloads, but they have a new manga comics that you can actually download on the service, which is kind of neat.
1830137	1833780	Plus, they had their Nintendo channel for a while before we did.
1834260	1839304	Well, they're getting another channel, and it's not too surprising since the other two consoles also have one similar.
1839824	1845649	It's a new video streaming service that will be available now.
1846894	1850699	This is actually in conjunction with Densetsu.
1857660	1863002	Not your typical video download service because they're not going to have movies.
1864222	1866483	They're not going to really have a lot of TV shows and stuff.
1866823	1868323	What they're going to have, though, is like... Oh, my God.
1868724	1870284	Is it what I've always been waiting for?
1870464	1871705	A porno-on-demand service?
1871945	1873285	No, it's not a porno-on-demand service.
1873605	1880807	It's actually going to be some... They're going to have Nintendo videos on there, whatever that's supposed to be.
1881188	1884989	I don't know if that's like the old Nintendo cartoons, you know, like the old Donkey Kong stuff and...
1885669	1885869	and so on.
1912136	1914157	There's that humming that one of the mics is causing.
1914177	1914898	I don't know which one.
1915658	1915898	Is it?
1916418	1917599	Yeah, here.
1917759	1919020	That's a very naughty microphone.
1919280	1920220	Sorry, guys.
1920740	1921161	Live radio.
1921401	1922501	Hi.
1922941	1926343	And so, yeah, it's going to be coming early next year.
1926963	1933586	No prices have been announced yet, but interesting, though, that they're going to be bringing this out.
1934047	1935947	Maybe this is something that's coming to the U.S.
1937828	1938489	I don't know how this...
1939841	1947283	To be honest, if you've ever used the web browser in this, the bandwidth to the Wii seems very, very slow.
1947343	1952964	So can you imagine actually downloading content with the Wii, like actual videos and stuff?
1953044	1954144	I think it would take forever.
1954945	1959726	We kind of need that upgrade that's supposed to get our SD cards, which wasn't that supposed to be out by the end of the year?
1959746	1959786	No.
1961795	1966056	Right, that won't be coming out until... You'll probably have to buy a game that'll unlock that or some shit.
1967216	1970637	Hitstun in chat says, Sky, porno on demand service equals the internet.
1970677	1971377	Ooh, touche.
1971797	1973737	But I can't really get that on my TV very easily.
1974777	1978918	I can use the internet channel or the PS3's internet thingy, I know, but they suck.
1980178	1980878	They're clunky.
1981518	1983139	Have you tried using YouTube on the Wii?
1983179	1984019	It's not that good.
1984419	1985779	But you can do porno too.
1985839	1987219	We did that one time, actually.
1987399	1988600	It was clunky.
1988940	1990460	Yeah, that was actually last New Year's, wasn't it?
1991479	1996623	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2014242	2016724	Oh Lord, please let them do a sequel to this video.
2016924	2017325	Amen.
2017585	2018565	And pterodactyl porn.
2019106	2022889	Hey, Food Delivery Channel is coming to Japan as well.
2022929	2023489	That's right.
2023989	2028272	If you want to get food delivered to you, you can now do that through your Wii.
2028332	2028933	It's called the...
2029312	2031373	Dimei Channel, the food delivery channel.
2032573	2033953	8,500 different restaurants.
2034314	2036674	Apparently you are going to be able to browse it by genre.
2036734	2041156	So like, you know, pizza, bento boxes, sushi, curry, Chinese, whatever.
2042256	2046717	You apparently can go on here and the restaurants will actually estimate what the delivery time is.
2047017	2048378	You place the order on the Wii.
2048698	2052439	It's faxed to the restaurant and then it's kind of like ordering it on the internet.
2052939	2055201	And I was kind of like, this has got to be bullshit.
2055621	2058603	But apparently, there's screenshots and everything.
2058643	2064867	And granted, this stuff can be photoshopped, but I don't know why someone would want to waste that colossal amount of time on a stupid prank on Christmas.
2064887	2066448	So this looks to be the real deal.
2066468	2067989	They didn't know that we would report on it.
2068669	2069270	I guess so.
2069470	2071531	I don't know, but this looks to be pretty authentic.
2072171	2075774	And which is strange, because people predicted that this might happen a long time ago.
2075854	2077315	Well, I suppose people predicted everything.
2077675	2082298	But yeah, you look at this here, and there's even a screenshot here where somebody can click on Pizza Hut and order pizza.
2084266	2084707	Interesting.
2087310	2087570	I don't know.
2087610	2093797	If they did something like this in the U.S., do you think... Man, Pizza Hut is... Talk about, like, a whore for, like, ordering stuff.
2093837	2096540	I mean, you know, before they were in, like, EverQuest.
2096580	2097701	Slash Pizza, yeah.
2097802	2098522	Now they're in this.
2099003	2103528	I would love to have a Pizza Hut here with the Japanese menu.
2104710	2111959	No, seriously, I was seeing one of the people I keep up with lived over there and posted a picture of the order menu.
2112360	2113862	There's some very funky pizzas.
2114202	2117367	It's like something out of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or California Pizza Kitchen.
2117807	2119089	Or John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
2119509	2119650	No.
2119910	2120210	Okay.
2122313	2130201	Um, yeah, the thing is, though, I don't think a channel like that would work here because we're not so, we're so spread out here in the U.S.
2130241	2133464	Whereas in Japan, there's a lot more kind of, you know what I mean?
2133985	2135926	Like, I don't think it might work in different cities.
2136447	2144054	It might work in different, like, it might, they might be able to do that for New York City for, well, I don't even know if you could do it in Los Angeles and make it worth it.
2144174	2144495	I don't know.
2144895	2145536	Pizza Hut equals Kaka Hut
2172236	2173999	Actually, that's probably one of the pizzas you can get in Japan.
2174019	2174820	You know what, though?
2176182	2178164	And I'll tell you, their pasta is pretty good.
2179226	2186536	I actually thought about getting some of that, but the tray of pasta that they give you is huge, and that would just look ridiculous if I'm eating a huge tray of pasta here.
2187277	2188518	Goodness, we don't have the camera anymore.
2189369	2190109	We don't have the camera.
2190149	2191850	You could bring an entire cake.
2191870	2192710	But still, though, I wouldn't.
2192730	2195131	You could bring an entire cake and eat it on here.
2195531	2196612	I don't like that much cake.
2196672	2198472	I'll just say, Fatty's eating cake again.
2199433	2200313	Fatty's eating cake.
2200433	2201433	I don't like cake.
2202034	2204014	Now, I did want to make a meatball sub, though.
2205195	2213238	I saw, like, on the Food Network, they had this thing where they were making it over in someone's kitchen, and that's what they decided to make is a meatball sub.
2213258	2214338	Like, damn, it looks good.
2214618	2216839	And all of a sudden, you know, I got craving for a meatball sub.
2217738	2221402	This is the Pizza Hut menu in Japan as of June.
2222663	2224364	And I want you to tell me if this sounds tasty to you.
2224945	2232352	There's bacon mushroom, barbecue chicken, carbonara, which is bacon, egg spread, and black pepper.
2232872	2233993	Without the egg spread, yes.
2234474	2235274	Cheese and cheese.
2236275	2236595	Sure.
2236615	2236956	Sure.
2237731	2238412	Yes and yes.
2238512	2245158	Crab and Shrimp Mayo King, which is fried shrimp, fake crab, corn, onion, broccoli, and mayonnaise.
2245238	2246720	I need the listeners to understand this.
2247120	2248201	I fucking hate mayonnaise.
2248241	2254567	Don't you ever give me anything with mayonnaise even remotely near it because mayonnaise will ruin anything for me.
2254587	2255048	I hate mayonnaise.
2255188	2256868	I hate, hate, hate mayonnaise.
2256888	2258089	I hate warm mayonnaise.
2258529	2261409	Because warm mayonnaise, like mayonnaise on burgers, awful.
2261769	2263130	On sandwiches, okay.
2263250	2264170	Well, these are great.
2264210	2267390	Okay, the deluxe is pepperoni, salami, bacon, and green peppers, blah, blah, blah.
2267610	2268250	Yes, yes, yes.
2268411	2270111	Gomadari pork, I'd actually eat that.
2270171	2274692	It's a burdock root mix, sesame sauce pork, shredded seaweed, and sesame sauce.
2275892	2281233	The Idaho special is diced potatoes, bacon, onions, corn, parsley, black pepper, and mayonnaise.
2281892	2283394	That sounds awesome except for the mayonnaise part.
2283414	2287858	There's one called the Mayo Q. If you can guess what that is, it's barbecue with mayonnaise.
2288299	2289280	Meat Paradise.
2290281	2293605	Pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.
2294846	2295246	Loki?
2295267	2296268	Does that sound good to you?
2296328	2297469	I think we need to go to Japan.
2297769	2298570	What was it?
2298590	2299952	It's called the Meat Paradise.
2300452	2300632	And?
2301033	2303776	It's pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.
2305501	2309444	That's just like, they have it already over here.
2309584	2314348	It's like the Montague's All Meat Marvel.
2315749	2322954	They used to have beef on their pizzas, but they don't do it anymore because apparently not that many people like beef and it kind of went bad because no one ate it.
2323935	2327918	Here's a Sicilian style pizza with tuna, mushrooms, and meat sauce.
2327938	2328459	I hate tuna too.
2329119	2331740	We could do a meat pizza round table over here.
2332080	2339343	Because they have multiple varieties of different pepperonis and different sausages.
2339484	2342145	I think they have chicken, too, and ham.
2342805	2344526	God, we could just pile that shit up.
2345126	2348107	I remember someone that used to order a quad sausage pizza.
2348127	2349788	That'd be four times the amount of sausage.
2350228	2354030	I kid you not, it was like a giant patty on top of the entire...
2355050	2355350	Pizza.
2355410	2357251	It's like, what is wrong with you people?
2357491	2358212	Here, Rob.
2358272	2359012	This one's for you.
2359652	2361233	Mochi, mentai, and potato.
2361813	2369977	Large shrimp, diced potatoes, Korean mochi, corn, onion, mayonnaise, we'll ask for it without, shredded seaweed, and fish roe sauce.
2370738	2371158	Mochi?
2373200	2377541	or there's the seafood mix, which is large shrimp, squid, tuna, and mayonnaise, broccoli, and onion.
2377881	2380342	Who puts, I want to know who puts corn on a pizza.
2380822	2384203	All the rest of it, I could take, but corn is fucking disgusting.
2384243	2384704	I've seen it.
2385744	2386624	And then again, I'm also allergic to corn.
2386644	2388885	Better yet, who puts mayonnaise on a pizza?
2388905	2391726	I think they put mayonnaise on everything in Japan.
2393345	2393966	So I can't go to Japan.
2393986	2394346	Here we go.
2394506	2395467	The last one on here.
2395647	2396628	I'd die of starvation.
2396688	2398570	Tartar Chicken Nanban.
2399331	2403896	Nanban Chicken, Red Peppers, Parsley, Tartar Sauce, and Nanban Sauce.
2404136	2407900	As long as Nanban doesn't mean like asshole juice, I'll be fine.
2408981	2410342	It's basically Portuguese-style chicken.
2410642	2411423	Okay, that's fine.
2412004	2412805	Like, what is that?
2414186	2416008	When you're talking about a chicken, it could be anything.
2418672	2418952	Anyhow.
2420793	2425873	Some of this is just like... I would actually eat it, though, because some of this stuff, I'd order something similar.
2426634	2428534	And really, the cheese and cheese is like a margarita.
2429694	2431034	The margarita pizza.
2431854	2436695	But I actually would order some of this stuff, because I have it at CPK, but still.
2438416	2442336	Okay, I ordered... How did this turn into Orange Lounge Foodio, going on like 15 minutes now?
2442376	2445977	Because this is why I want them to deliver Japanese-style pizza.
2446693	2448734	And poor Bobby got chased off the air for this.
2449175	2449835	Yes, he did.
2450616	2451576	Non-bond chicken.
2452157	2454758	Well, if he was talking about pizza, we would have been fine with that.
2456880	2458481	Note to Bobby, your show needs more meat.
2459001	2459261	All right.
2460182	2461322	You need meat paradise.
2461362	2462663	All right, stop picking on Bobby.
2462803	2463104	All right.
2465205	2468107	DarkSakura, what else is going on in gaming news?
2468925	2473087	Well, there is this plumber named Mario who lives near a pizza place.
2473147	2473607	No, I'm kidding.
2475308	2482491	Actually, it's something to be coming out for the virtual console in Japan is Super Smash Bros.
2483171	2485132	Like the Nintendo 64 one.
2485512	2486372	Dun dun dun.
2486753	2488333	It will be there in January.
2489114	2492115	So it's going to be out there for 1,200 points each.
2496292	2501275	But there's no real say as to when we'd probably get it out here.
2501755	2505217	But that means we probably will be getting it since we tend to get some of the stuff.
2506397	2513681	If it was a release yawn and hither, then it would definitely be duplicated over here, I would think.
2516323	2516803	So there.
2517983	2518224	Rob?
2519484	2520385	That sounds nice.
2520505	2522226	I guess I would download that.
2522406	2522666	What?
2523046	2523706	Meet Paradise.
2525448	2530092	Looking at some comments in chat, Giovedea in chat says, I have had a taco pizza with corn on it.
2530152	2530952	It was really tasty.
2533434	2535455	I was trying to, it's just pizza chat.
2535516	2536596	I didn't see anything about video games.
2536656	2537577	I get shrimp scampi pizza.
2537637	2540279	Except, oh, Acidic Vampire asked a good question.
2540299	2541380	Will Super Smash Bros.
2541580	2542481	64 have online play?
2542881	2543361	You wish.
2543401	2543441	No.
2543761	2544142	You wish.
2546120	2548884	Did the Nintendo 64 version have online play?
2549525	2554713	But in Pokemon Snap, they added the feature where you can save the snaps to your Wii message board.
2554953	2555333	So?
2555674	2558798	So it shows they can enhance the games if they really want to.
2559039	2559239	So?
2559259	2559760	And they don't.
2561318	2573181	It makes you wonder, doesn't it make you wonder if maybe Pokemon Snap at one point had some type of feature to save those pictures in some type of more exportable format?
2573721	2581503	Like the game maybe originally was going to let you save them to some type of computer or something, and now they turned it into this thing instead?
2581803	2584864	Because that's the only game that has had anything special happen to it.
2585737	2586477	Thank you for watching!
2611260	2613901	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to chat with us.
2613981	2614201	Aha!
2614501	2616141	That's exactly the type of thing I was looking for.
2616241	2623103	GameGuru in chat, see this is why I love having a live chat room, says Pokemon Snap had a feature to download them to Blockbuster and print them out.
2624324	2627645	So it's not, they didn't even really, really enhance it that much.
2627885	2633226	They took a feature that everybody forgot about, including yours truly, and just changed it slightly.
2634627	2635907	It's an altered enhancement.
2637605	2638766	Wasn't that a Sega Genesis game?
2638926	2639406	Alright, forget it.
2639426	2641588	How about some release dates, Loki?
2641848	2642929	Altered Enhancement?
2644530	2648073	Well, um, yeah.
2648834	2651436	There's, uh, nothing coming out.
2652496	2652737	At all.
2653317	2653557	Nothing?
2653577	2654278	Not a damn thing?
2654678	2655959	Not a damn thing.
2656640	2656960	Alright.
2657780	2658101	Wow.
2658721	2663785	Yeah, this is not a good time of year for, um, you know, most companies are closed, and
2665168	2666029	Yeah, not a thing.
2666169	2667950	Not even like Imagine?
2668850	2674994	No, the Spore comic book creator, I think, was the only thing, and that's not even technically a game.
2677035	2683759	Well, I wish I could tell you it looked much different in Japan, but it actually does not look like we have a lot of releases this week either in Japan.
2684980	2688162	I'm looking very quickly to see if there's anything on Wii.
2688951	2689531	Well, how about the U.K. ?
2713658	2715700	Rob, we've had a call for more pizza.
2741400	2742761	More pizza?
2742881	2744601	I can't even think about more pizza.
2745421	2749183	Did they have like a peanut butter and jelly pizza or something in that John's Incredible crappy pizza?
2749663	2751444	Um, I don't think so.
2751964	2752544	Well, they might.
2752564	2752904	I don't know.
2752944	2763148	I just know, I remember the ones that are like different and crazy are the macaroni and cheese pizza and the, uh, that peanut butter one that had the actual peanuts on it, which I thought was strange.
2763308	2763428	YUM
2790155	2791657	and there's an ebi.
2792197	2792998	That's the same one.
2793018	2793559	That's the shrimp.
2794199	2797142	And then the Shrimp Thousand Island Wrap.
2798203	2802307	You know when I go to Hawaii in two weeks, you know what I have to get at McDonald's?
2802828	2803048	What?
2803208	2803909	Spam Burger.
2804189	2805391	Oh my God, aren't those good?
2806331	2807373	I like Spam Musubi.
2807533	2810315	And the teriyaki pineapple thingy they do, right?
2810616	2812698	And they also have McPork.
2814935	2816576	and the Teriyaki McBurger.
2817436	2819217	So, there's more food for everyone.
2819257	2821038	We do have gaming news at some point, right?
2821418	2821958	Yes, we do.
2822038	2824379	I'm looking at Burger King.
2825980	2831162	Yes, like the merger of spam and shrimp and hamburgers.
2832748	2834630	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2850199	2850439	Oh, yeah.
2879431	2883614	This is actually very old news, apparently, and I don't understand how this slipped in.
2884215	2884655	My bad.
2885316	2886977	Apparently this already happened, like, a long time ago.
2890940	2892302	I don't know how this got mixed in there.
2892322	2893963	It's not the news, it's the old.
2895104	2896405	It is really old.
2896765	2901649	So I'm like, looking at this, it's all, has announced on September 17th, I'm like, what the fuck?
2901729	2902910	And it's all September 18th.
2904156	2908199	You know, when I was putting this together tonight, I was kind of like, I thought that already happened, but I didn't really know.
2908239	2909059	My bad.
2909179	2909860	But that's weird, though.
2909900	2913322	Okay, just wait until you say, and see, we were just recapping what happened this year.
2913582	2914803	Yes, we're totally recapping.
2916944	2917625	Fuck this shit.
2917845	2918325	You know what?
2919006	2920787	I don't care if they merge or, because you know what?
2920807	2923849	They're still going to put out fucking Dynasty Warriors games out the ass.
2924329	2926190	By the way, Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires comes out February.
2926210	2926510	You know what?
2926530	2926890	Fuck the show.
2926931	2927791	Let's go get pizza.
2928812	2929072	Really?
2932076	2934537	The sad thing is, I'm half serious.
2936398	2943561	If there was a way we could somehow just take the camera and go out on the road and take it with us to get pizza, I would totally do it.
2944442	2945102	I would say yes.
2945122	2947443	I would say, the hell with the show, pizza.
2949204	2949724	Anyway, sorry.
2949864	2950945	We can't do that, Rob.
2950965	2951705	We love our people.
2952025	2952986	I know, we do love our people.
2953066	2954566	Whatever, I give up, you know.
2955447	2955827	It was...
2957401	2959243	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2975000	2979722	They have claimed patent infringement, Konami has, and intellectual property rights infringement.
2980242	2985304	This was Konami of Korea that actually did it, because they're filing this lawsuit against a Korean company.
2986064	2988705	They filed it in the Seoul Central District Court in Korea.
2989066	2990446	They want to get damages.
2990546	2994528	They want to stop Pentavision from selling the offending products, quote-unquote.
2994928	2997389	Which, of course, has unleashed the outcries of...
2998029	2998910	Not fair!
2999190	3000011	Unfair!
3000231	3007377	Konami sues everybody and everything, and Konami, you suck, and da-da-da-da-da, and all this stuff, but... I don't know.
3007617	3008798	How do you guys feel about this?
3008918	3011120	I mean, I don't know how many of you have played DJ Maxx.
3011140	3012621	I've definitely seen the game played.
3012641	3018006	I have a friend who's obsessed with it, and made it a point to show me, you know, DJ Maxx, and wanted to show me what the game was all about.
3018526	3022009	And, you know, I did look at it and go, wow, this really looks like Beatmania.
3024851	3024872	I...
3026738	3028979	I mean, granted, I realize it's played with buttons.
3029039	3034562	It's not exactly the same, but the look and feel was kind of the same, I'm sorry to say.
3036463	3037224	But I don't know.
3037284	3041466	Do the people that say, hey, Konami just sues everything, is there a point here?
3041566	3041766	What?
3041826	3042446	What do you guys think?
3043127	3044628	I'm really not surprised in the least.
3045288	3047329	So I'm just going to roll my eyes and go next.
3048810	3056274	I am surprised because I thought, and I could be very wrong about this, but I thought that
3057137	3067506	and Pentavision, actually, the company that makes DJ Max, came out of the company that made Easy to DJ, since most of the artists in DJ Max are from Easy to DJ.
3068627	3078035	I would find that as a very big coincidence if that was not the case, but I would figure that it's more of a ripoff of Easy to DJ, and who cares?
3078575	3083920	To be honest, I thought Easy to DJ was better than Beatmania anyways, so...
3084895	3098144	Whatever, and they're going to go ahead and sue them, probably because they're planning on making some crappy music game for the PSP or something, because, you know, Konami's on the latest and greatest trends for music games.
3098944	3099965	Oh wait, no, they're not anymore.
3100185	3101786	They're way behind everything.
3103866	3111412	So, Hanukkah Harry in chat says, it's all a trap set up by Konami by not releasing quality versions of Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Beat Mania in the US.
3111472	3114034	They are setting up other companies to come out with copies of them.
3114394	3118577	Konami then sues them and gets a piece of the action without lifting a finger except to call their lawyers.
3119698	3123461	You know, as much as that makes sense, I don't think that's it.
3124121	3127384	I don't think Konami in their minds thinks they're not doing a good enough job.
3127864	3131107	I think Konami thinks Rock Revolution is a quality product.
3131914	3137415	I think there are people at Konami, probably Konami Japan, that think that that is what people want.
3139456	3144657	Guitar Hero and Rock Band are the subpar games.
3145057	3147137	Rock Revolution is a wonderful game.
3147598	3153619	And these other games are infringing on the rightful heir to the music game throne, which is Rock Revolution.
3153799	3157920	The problem now is that they wanted to make a music game and...
3158892	3162873	They're worried about infringing on other people's patents.
3162953	3173776	And now, unfortunately, since they came out with a drum that's totally different than what Drum Mania had, the best thing they could do is come out with what they did for Drum Mania, basically, and bring that over here.
3173836	3181217	And at a time, it was kind of neat as a drum game, but things have gotten a lot better since then.
3181757	3186579	And they can't come out with something that looks similar because they will get sued by the other companies.
3186699	3187619	And they'll be kind of a...
3188419	3189560	You know, 180 for them.
3190081	3197347	Hanaka Harry wants to clarify he was mostly joking with the comment, but I have seen that comment like for real reels and different threads around the internet about this.
3197788	3208557	And if you think I'm wrong in what I'm saying about the Konami of Japan is seriously disillusioned to their fan base, all you need to do is look at Beat and Groovy and Rock Revolution because these are the products Konami is continuing to put out.
3209335	3212618	Yeah, but see, I think in Japan, though, they're actually putting out some good games over there.
3212818	3222686	Like, if you look, for example, at the new Dance Dance Revolution, what would be the equivalent of Haas Party 2 over there on the Wii, it's actually a lot better than it is over here.
3223167	3229492	Like, they have different types of music and stuff like that, which obviously applies to more of the people that play the Wii over there.
3230233	3235077	And then you also have Jew Beat and stuff like that, which look pretty good.
3236378	3236598	But,
3238268	3238588	I don't know.
3238628	3244573	I don't think necessarily... I think they don't really know what their audience is anymore, and that's pretty sad.
3247275	3253279	But at the same time, they can't honestly look at Rock Revolution as a success, because it's not.
3253680	3256122	I mean, look at how fast that thing price dropped.
3256662	3257643	Look at the sales for it.
3257663	3259264	I mean, I think they speak for themselves.
3259424	3264348	It was a waste of effort on their part, and it wasn't much of an effort to begin with, so...
3266196	3267797	Get what you put into it, I guess.
3268137	3292125	Here's my thought, and tell me if I'm off-base with this one, but I believe that if you're pissed off about this, whether you're a fan of DJ Max or a fan of music games who is getting a little frustrated at Konami's putting out subpar music games and then trying to take out these other guys, I think now's the time for you to take five minutes of your life to sit down and write an angry letter.
3292565	3294086	And I don't mean an unprofessional letter.
3294502	3295323	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3315219	3315939	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3341033	3341753	Yes, I don't.
3342253	3342834	I think you're wrong.
3343114	3345494	Because these Korean versions have been out for a while now.
3345815	3346755	But isn't it funny?
3347275	3349176	When did they sue the people that made In The Groove?
3349576	3350796	When the home version was announced.
3351376	3353837	When are they suing the people that made the Pentavision thing?
3353897	3356218	When the US DJ Maxx was on its way out.
3357538	3358559	There's a correlation there.
3360759	3366261	I'm convinced that... I mean, I understand this is all going down in Korean court of law, but it's still an international company.
3368052	3371293	Who has, you know, much bigger interests in the U.S.
3371373	3371933	and Japan.
3373013	3373533	So I don't know.
3374293	3379534	DarkSakura, sometimes you like to give your input on these types of protests and business stories.
3379674	3382835	What do you think would be the best thing for a person to do who's ticked off?
3384035	3387375	Honestly, it's going to be, you know, send in your letters.
3387755	3389596	Buy stock, shit, you know.
3390096	3391316	What did we say before?
3391676	3392736	Buy stock in the company.
3392776	3395457	Then you have a right to be heard as a shareholder.
3396137	3396297	So...
3397540	3399842	But don't post an angry thing on the internet.
3400142	3403645	Don't post petition online because you know what that's going to do?
3404125	3404486	Nothing.
3404926	3405607	Absolutely nothing.
3405627	3413093	The only type of petition that's going to have any real swing is if you get your signatures, make a copy, and send it to Konami.
3414194	3421860	Because then the people that are advocating for you at Konami, of which there have been some, look at Jason Enos.
3422080	3423501	Would you have ever had DDR in the U.S.
3423521	3423902	without him?
3423942	3424462	Don't think so.
3424482	3425403	Okay?
3425814	3426054	DarkSakura?
3443363	3444804	Let me see.
3445425	3453811	Oh, just a little game that a few people were playing and then it started going poop.
3454391	3455272	Tabula Rasa!
3456653	3469503	So, NCSoft is saying that Tabula Rasa is free to play and will be free to play until the 28th of February 2009 when they take down the servers.
3471218	3479665	So, you can actually get a serial code from the support website and download the client and you can play.
3480406	3485911	So, I mean, it will ask you for your credit card number, but they're not going to charge you for shit.
3486031	3488693	So, enjoy it while it lasts.
3490455	3494018	That does seem weird that they want your credit card number even though they're not actually going to charge you.
3494358	3495199	Doesn't that seem a little weird?
3496158	3496879	I could possibly be.
3522898	3523218	Who knows?
3523498	3524639	I mean, hey, free.
3524999	3526440	Anybody here think they might check it out?
3526640	3526800	No.
3527161	3527301	Nope.
3528101	3528481	I might.
3529382	3529742	I might.
3530643	3532223	I feel like I want to know what I'm missing.
3533424	3537306	But it's kind of weird that they're doing this because what if suddenly people find that they really like this game?
3538227	3540368	Well, then that gives them incentive to put it back to P2P.
3540868	3541169	I guess.
3541209	3541509	We'll see.
3542520	3544502	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3562699	3573727	But I guess during... In the first four days of the open beta, Home produced more money for Sony than the video download service did in its first week.
3575288	3576089	I'm not surprised.
3577050	3582834	And I guess the biggest sellers are the ridiculously priced Santa outfits.
3584235	3584575	Huh!
3585436	3585696	Oops.
3587057	3591661	And... Yeah, they basically said it's...
3593544	3594784	Make Your Trophy Room
3622902	3623843	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3644229	3644969	You know what's interesting, though?
3644989	3648711	They don't say, like, what was available on the store in the first week in the video store.
3648811	3656295	Like, maybe it's making not a fair comparison here, because maybe the video store had very slim pickings the first week, so it was, like, all old stuff.
3656315	3656916	I mean, I don't know.
3656956	3658857	I don't remember, because I didn't have a PS3 back then.
3660117	3660598	I don't remember.
3660658	3663299	I didn't use the video service, so I don't know.
3665450	3666691	Some people are excited about Home, though.
3666711	3670734	We have Trishlicious in chat says, Gotta save some cash and get a PS3 for Home.
3670774	3671634	I want to make content.
3672315	3675317	Acidic Vampire says, There are Echo Chrome cults in Home.
3675377	3675897	Seriously.
3676840	3677620	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3699273	3702315	and he was actually trying to set up a gay-straight alliance club in home.
3702375	3704776	He's a straight guy who's a supporter of gay rights.
3705157	3725168	However, he found that the words gay and bisexual were not allowed in Sony's virtual world, meaning that there were a lot of kind of words to be discovered that were not able to be used in home, including hell, Christ, Jew, which, by the way, means all derivatives of those words cannot be used either.
3725668	3727970	So you cannot say, hello.
3729192	3730493	Because it has hell in it.
3733715	3734436	I'm not lying.
3735817	3744103	And the San Francisco Chronicle ran a quote from this guy who was trying to set up the club, who I think sums up the way a lot of people are thinking.
3744444	3749768	Quote, I can understand if they're filtering out profanity, but it feels like it's discrimination.
3750088	3755312	By blocking a word like gay, which is a preferred term by the gay community, you're encouraging it as a bad word.
3757355	3762720	A City Vampire in chat says gay is allowed now, so who knows, maybe Sony made a hot fix because of this news.
3763160	3765262	Why don't people just get over it?
3766463	3766843	The end.
3767324	3767724	Get over it.
3769676	3770337	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3793567	3794268	and things like that.
3794868	3796149	It just reminds me of this.
3797130	3797911	It's the same thing.
3798592	3799453	Honestly, I don't know.
3799573	3800974	It's not that big a deal to me.
3801014	3802355	At least it's consistent.
3802816	3803196	I don't know.
3803516	3804277	But here's my thing.
3804457	3806199	I don't think they should censor words at all.
3807440	3808821	Because people will get around it.
3809022	3809362	Exactly.
3809402	3812205	Like Tigerclaw says they can spell it as H3LLO.
3812365	3812805	How about this?
3813125	3815628	Have an option where you can turn it on or off.
3815948	3817490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3831425	3837348	If I press that button on a user, then it should send the last 20 things that user has said to Sony.
3837609	3841471	So Sony can review it and decide if this person should be allowed to be at home anymore or not.
3842051	3844933	If I'm abusing this, then I should have the button taken away from me.
3845473	3846274	How hard is this?
3846994	3848075	How hard would this system be?
3848555	3854298	And then I think you should be able to say fucking shit and cock and gay and fag and all that stuff as much as you want.
3854598	3855499	You can say any of it.
3856465	3857346	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3881851	3886055	I can't remember how many pieces it took to make the Santa outfit, but it was like $2.50.
3886155	3890658	And yeah, that's probably $2.50 more than I should have spent it on.
3891999	3894521	But it's $2.50, and I was like, whatever.
3894681	3900446	I buy these stupid $5, $10 games from live, and who cares?
3900546	3900886	It's $2.50.
3902547	3905990	SSJ100Matt says in chat, asshole juice, definitely banned.
3906870	3907431	Definitely banned.
3910568	3912653	GS68 says Sophomore would be banned.
3912673	3913475	It has homo in it.
3915083	3916964	S-O-P-H-O-M-O-R-E.
3917324	3918905	Probably another word that's banned in home.
3919406	3919766	I don't know.
3919806	3921887	You know, at least it's consistent.
3921947	3923048	But I don't know.
3923068	3927410	I think this is a case of a few bad apples ruin the barrel for everyone.
3927470	3930232	And there's people that don't know how to use these words in proper context.
3930272	3937996	And because of these assholes, the rest of us have to pay the price of this hypersensitivity and hair trigger of which we've seen Sony use before.
3938016	3939177	I'm a little bit plant.
3940437	3942719	So to these people who are...
3944025	3946126	We dedicate the FUs of the week to you.
3946146	3947467	FU to Dalmore for being in Korea.
3972679	3976780	I want to order eyeballs and wigs from that site, and they're in Korea.
3977540	3981941	So a $20 pair of eyes cost me $45 after EMS shipping.
3983261	3984001	Fuck a bunch of that.
3985902	3986302	Loki!
3987902	3990463	F you to my need to buy yet another airsoft gun.
3991943	3996484	Because I, you know, I bought a shotgun, actually, that's pretty cool.
3997404	4000185	I thought it shot three rounds at once, but it doesn't.
4000589	4003810	which is disappointing, but you can fire it pretty fast, which is cool.
4006091	4008852	But I have this urge to have another AUG gun.
4010612	4012953	And I really shouldn't buy another one.
4013093	4014914	Arcadian42, do you have any FUs of the week?
4015554	4019735	FU to the never-ending clutter in my apartment, which I never get around to.
4019755	4027758	Hopefully I'll get the time off I have this week, because one of my jobs is off, so get something every day, hopefully.
4028696	4029817	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4054645	4056607	I like to braid my hair now that it's long enough.
4056967	4057447	Ha ha.
4057868	4058268	Ha ha.
4058548	4059189	No, seriously.
4059789	4065874	Braid, the game that came out for Xbox Live Arcade, is going to be out on the PC between February and March 2009.
4066194	4076562	So, they don't know if it's... They actually are also thinking that there's going to be a Mac version, too, which would be cool.
4077363	4080846	And no word yet, though, if there's going to be a version for PS3.
4082873	4085198	Alright.
4085218	4087342	Speaking of PS3... See, there's games on the Mac, ha ha.
4088567	4088847	A few.
4089687	4106251	Speaking of the PS3, Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 2 was just released and there is a problem with the game, unfortunately, that apparently a bunch of users are reporting that there is a glitch that renders their save files completely useless.
4106791	4111372	Selecting a corrupted save file will freeze the gamers on a permanent loading screen.
4112173	4113413	And apparently this is a...
4114273	4121038	Something that's going to be patched soon, however, because of the holidays, Sony's QA department is taking a little break.
4121538	4125882	So that means that the patch will not be available until after the new year sometime in January.
4128043	4128643	That sucks.
4132927	4135809	This seems like the type of thing that Penny Arcade would have done a comic about.
4136689	4137310	Is it just me?
4138511	4140332	But somehow I don't think there will actually be one.
4140868	4143829	Hey, speaking of patches, this has been a long-awaited one.
4143909	4148610	Castle Crashers apparently is finally getting its patch.
4149150	4150590	That's only about four months late.
4152130	4154051	The patch, I believe, went up this week.
4154111	4158031	I think it actually was scheduled to go up on Christmas Day.
4158531	4159212	No, Christmas Eve.
4159852	4160852	I think it went up finally.
4161312	4166533	So, hey, you should go back and play some Castle Crashers because now you can online anyway.
4167341	4167901	So there you go.
4168521	4172682	Apparently, some extra things were thrown in as well, though.
4172743	4183145	Not just some fixes to the game, but apparently I think they did some other little new things, like weapons and stuff like that, and two new characters.
4184126	4185706	The king is one of them, and so on.
4186086	4186766	And a chainsaw?
4186786	4187687	Do I see a chainsaw?
4187727	4189187	Yes, there is a new weapon, the chainsaw.
4191148	4191448	There you go.
4191468	4192568	I'll have to play that now.
4193362	4194223	So check that out.
4195644	4199166	That's one of those titles I didn't pay money for because everybody told me you really couldn't play it online.
4199487	4200848	But maybe I'll go back and check it out now.
4200928	4204550	But I still think... My gut tells me they'll put it on sale in three months' time.
4204610	4204991	So I don't know.
4205011	4205731	I might try to hold out.
4206132	4207793	GameGuru in chat says, Castle Crashers?
4207833	4208213	What's that?
4208253	4209294	Who cares about that anymore?
4210175	4212416	TwitchAscidicVampire says, I like Castle Crashers.
4213057	4213377	Cry.
4215018	4215859	Anyway, let's move on.
4218361	4219041	Moving forward...
4224125	4226087	Oh, I'm sorry, I completely blinked.
4227668	4228929	How about the Gizmondo?
4231031	4232012	Do we remember this thing?
4232152	4232673	How about it?
4233914	4237297	Well, they are once again rescheduling the launch of the Gizmondo.
4237337	4238338	They haven't given up.
4240019	4244023	The quote says it's due to the economic climate in the U.S.
4244543	4245864	as well as the rest of the world.
4246265	4249548	Maybe it might have something to do with your product being crap.
4250789	4250869	Um...
4252432	4262214	At any rate, they were deciding to turn the Gizmondo into a smartphone with a 3D graphics chip and an open platform.
4262974	4266575	So basically, they're just trying to make another gaming taco.
4268575	4269656	But open platform?
4270276	4278197	Yeah, they actually wanted to have an open source app store for the Apple store compatibility.
4278717	4280098	Oh, that's kind of nice.
4280398	4280878	I like that.
4281018	4281558	I like open.
4282655	4284717	And they wanted to make the price point $99.
4287040	4287881	So maybe.
4288321	4289683	Still wouldn't buy it.
4292425	4295906	I bet you anything that Duke Nukem Forever will be on it.
4298327	4299587	You know what's funny though?
4299907	4307269	It's funny they want to go that route, but I probably wouldn't buy one just because of the fact that I have an iPhone and so I can have the open stuff already.
4307789	4309250	I can get almost anything on my iPhone.
4309270	4313471	They're going to have to show me something I can get on their system that I cannot get on my phone.
4314130	4317852	Lots of delays and revisions before the product's even released.
4318192	4319673	That's what you can get with the Gizmondo.
4319953	4336040	You know, I gotta say, though, I know you're not a big fan of the iPhones, Loki, but I gotta say, it is pretty impressive that I can have movies that I like and music and games and apps on my phone in my pocket everywhere I go.
4338255	4343076	and you get a wonderful data plan that goes along with that that's really expensive.
4343416	4344436	Congratulations.
4345396	4346817	It's worth it, honestly.
4347057	4348157	It's not worth it.
4348397	4350757	One thing people forget, in my opinion, it's worth it.
4351837	4357418	Well, like with my iPhone, for me and Dan, our overall cost went up by $10.
4357899	4359599	Only.
4361159	4365620	Once we, you know, adjusted some stuff we were being overcharged for before, but still...
4366893	4368195	I like it.
4368335	4369376	I got Katamari now.
4370036	4373820	GS68 says, I have an iPod Touch, thereby bypassing the phone plan thingy.
4374341	4378124	Ranma says, yeah, but Sky, my phone does the same thing and I don't have to pay an extra fee for it.
4379345	4379786	There you go.
4379986	4380747	Diverse opinions.
4381345	4383648	No thanks, I will never own an Apple product.
4383908	4384649	Never, ever.
4384729	4392539	I don't care if Nintendo had a fucking orgy with Apple and their next product is like super awesome virtual reality that pleasures me.
4392939	4395863	I will not buy this fucking system if it's Apple.
4395943	4396604	I'm sorry.
4397184	4399567	I will never, ever own anything.
4400368	4410776	If they make a pacemaker that's the only pacemaker on the face of the planet that will save my life, I will say let me die before I even take that thing.
4411337	4411977	Seriously.
4412378	4415600	Never, ever will I fall victim to them.
4415680	4427749	Please somebody record this part of the show just in case because you know there's going to be that day where Apple puts out bacon or something that Loki is going to have it and we all have to remind him of this moment and say, told you so.
4429190	4429411	All right.
4429731	4434274	Anyways, apparently there is a new Guitar Hero coming out.
4434674	4435074	Shock!
4435394	4436575	Another Guitar Hero?
4436895	4437216	Really?
4437276	4438296	That they would do that?
4438716	4440237	Well, this one's on the DS.
4440378	4441098	Yes, I know.
4441138	4441818	It's surprising.
4441838	4445020	You know, what, three releases in a matter of months?
4445581	4447822	But there is a new DS game coming out.
4448503	4454586	It was actually found out through a description on the ESRB website.
4454627	4456688	Yes, Guitar Hero Modern Hits.
4458111	4458853	We'll be coming out.
4458993	4465870	And they've already figured out what three of the songs are going to be based on this short description that was talking about possible offensive lyrics.
4466761	4477064	Well, the three songs that are pretty much confirmed to be in the game, Sum 41's Still Waiting, Franz Ferdinand's The Fallen, and Paralyzer by Finger Eleven.
4477905	4488688	And no word on when Modern Hits will be out, but you can better believe it, there'll be a ton more releases next year for Guitar Hero, both on the DS and probably on the rest of it.
4488708	4490429	Is the DSi going to screw this all up?
4492128	4492808	Thanks for watching!
4513041	4515423	You think there'll be several versions or what?
4515664	4521469	Well, I just don't think that they'll put out a version for the DSi or maybe the DSi gets drums or something stupid like that.
4521989	4532359	I mean, honestly, they could maybe make a new peripheral for the DSi that would plug into the SD card slot.
4533300	4533840	Just a thought.
4535061	4537864	You know, maybe a DSi only version or something like that.
4541064	4545547	I don't think it's going to be an issue, though, because like I said, there's so many systems out there right now for the DS.
4545867	4550209	I'm actually kind of surprised that they're even releasing DSi anytime soon in the U.S.
4550289	4553791	because they're still selling tons and tons and tons of DSs.
4554452	4558814	I mean, I would wait until it slows down before they release the DSi.
4559014	4560195	Parting kind of thinks they're not.
4560715	4568520	And I think that they are going to probably release the DSi soon just to try to get people to buy another DS.
4569400	4570721	Just like they did with the Game Boy Advance.
4571221	4573622	Never forget how many times you bought the Game Boy Advance.
4574642	4575323	Or the Game Boy.
4576804	4577924	How many times did they release it?
4578224	4583947	You know, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Player, Game Boy Advance.
4584167	4585788	Alright, we get it, we get it.
4586887	4590589	Hey, another lawsuit going on in the Nintendo world.
4590709	4598834	Nintendo is getting sued over their DS Lite charger and it's because of a fire that happened in January of 2007 in Kentucky.
4599455	4604357	Apparently the victims were compensated by the insurance company as usually happens with those types of things.
4604718	4608460	The insurance company though filed a complaint against Nintendo now.
4608920	4609401	In the U.S.
4609461	4618628	District Court, saying, quote, the DS was defective in design, manufacture, and or because it failed to warn consumers as to dangers associated with it.
4618668	4624933	Due to defects existing within the product, which caused a risk of overheating and fire, the product was recalled by Nintendo.
4625293	4630077	So what makes this notable, in my opinion, is that you can't blame this on some crazy asshole.
4630417	4632479	But now it's some crazy asshole's insurance company.
4632519	4633079	No, I'm just teasing.
4633380	4636142	But, you know, it's an insurance company suing Nintendo now.
4637761	4638541	What do you guys think?
4639062	4641222	Hearing that this is coming from an actual other company.
4641242	4642423	And this is Liberty Mutual.
4642503	4644484	It's not some little podunk insurance company.
4644944	4646484	Is suing Nintendo over the charger?
4646504	4648305	Do you think it's going to be a valid thing?
4648365	4649786	Do you think people are too sue-happy?
4650946	4651426	Any thoughts?
4652667	4656008	I think that they forgot how hot the DS really is.
4658109	4659129	So hot that it catches fire.
4660809	4669517	Well, if it's a liability issue and they haven't put in any type of significant warning, that is negligence on the part of Nintendo.
4670397	4671899	So, yeah, it's a legitimate suit.
4673520	4674721	I don't see any problem with it.
4676442	4678404	All right.
4678884	4679265	Let's see.
4679705	4684249	GS68 in chat says, I think everybody is trying to kill Nintendo with lawsuit-y death.
4685470	4686651	You know who should sue Nintendo?
4686871	4687432	Kami.
4687632	4688853	Then the circle will be complete.
4690310	4692492	It's the circle of lawsuits.
4694834	4695155	Forget it.
4711738	4712418	We want music, Rob!
4712438	4713179	It's gonna take a minute.
4713219	4713519	Better not.
4741220	4742283	I'm going to start to play some of this.
4759861	4760962	Thank you for watching!
4776312	4780514	This is the game that made me import my Dreamcast.
4781414	4784255	Because I wanted to play this that badly.
4784915	4793798	And so it came out actually on December 23rd, 1998 in Japan.
4794879	4798280	And it was the first game in the Sonic Adventure series.
4800901	4801521	It actually...
4803462	4806485	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4823220	4823960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4844011	4845012	Was that the one in the Genesis?
4845432	4850838	No, Sonic Jam was the Saturn release of all the Genesis and Game Gear and whatever versions.
4851018	4851378	Oh, right.
4851419	4853801	And it had a middle level that was all 3D.
4854201	4855823	It had different missions and stuff.
4855983	4860628	There's also Sonic 3D Blast was another one.
4861649	4866574	And, uh, in the... Uh, photo stages were...
4869088	4869488	They were.
4869628	4873309	They were in... Yeah, I guess they were in 3D-ish.
4873809	4875490	Sonic 2's bonus stage was 3D.
4875570	4878751	No, they went into a 3D box.
4879031	4884412	At any rate, you basically have your set levels and you play through with certain characters.
4884872	4887653	Of course, you've got Sonic, who is the main guy.
4888213	4892394	You have Miles Tails Prower, which I think is cool too.
4893694	4895896	Um, you've got Knuckles and Echidna.
4896917	4905145	And, um, I really, really, really, really would only ever play this game in Japanese because one of my favorite voice actors was, um, Knuckles' voice actor.
4905165	4906106	It's a video I never watched.
4906326	4909328	He was really cool.
4909369	4910810	He also was a boxer on Macross 7.
4911811	4913092	So it's like, I knew that voice!
4913552	4914653	I'm like, oh, nerd-tastic.
4915134	4917456	Um, there's also Amy Rose who beats shit with a hammer.
4919037	4920658	There's Big the Cat, who fishes.
4921778	4925839	Oh my god, I got tired of hearin' fishin'.
4925979	4928820	There's E-102 Gamma, which is the robot.
4929560	4932621	And you can play as Super Sonic once you've finished the game.
4932941	4937162	And of course he's all gone all Super Saiyan or whatever.
4937682	4942343	So you've also got Eggman for your bad guys.
4942464	4942924	Chaos...
4945097	4947621	Thank you for watching!
4960279	4964721	I'm saying Chao because I played it in Japanese first, so that's how they said it.
4965901	4970323	But they're so cool.
4970683	4972124	Who remembers the VMU, right?
4972804	4980608	You can actually download a virtual pet, the Alife system, and you can play Chao Adventure on your VMU.
4982469	4987131	For people who played this on the GameCube, you would actually play it on your Game Boy Advance.
4987711	4998717	And so you can raise your stats, and you actually can go into your little Chao house level or whatever, and play with them and see what they look like, and feed them coconuts, and do all kinds of bizarre crap with them.
5000258	5006381	Some of the other robots are in Gamma's story, which are the E-Series robots.
5009202	5010363	Also, Knights is in the game.
5012216	5026371	Night's is, um, if you're going into the, um, the Casinopolis, um, stage, there's actually a pinball area that's based on Night's, and when you go through the little special tunnel, you're flying through a Night's level.
5026411	5027132	It's pretty cool.
5028434	5028514	Um...
5031255	5038840	So it's basically, there's some, I guess, degree of RPG element to it.
5038941	5047547	In fact, it's just that it really has an in-depth story and you find different things to advance your plot and just keep moving through it.
5047567	5053531	But you've got your action stages and you've got your adventure levels, which is where I'm saying the RPG part of it comes into you.
5053951	5055953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5074669	5075050	Nerds.
5090572	5091552	You know, since this one came out.
5091632	5096293	Sonic Adventure 2 was okay, but this one just had everything.
5096874	5110657	I mean, from the sound effects when, you know, you get your bubbles or your shoes and, you know, the ending music being the same when you step on the platform, being the ones that you release your little forest buddies out of, you know?
5111917	5116818	It's just really, really awesome.
5117438	5119339	Um... Yes!
5119859	5119999	See?
5123018	5123919	Thank you for watching!
5144594	5145656	Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut
5161319	5163220	is an enhanced version of it.
5164140	5172146	And it has a minigame collection where you actually can get 12 different Game Gear games.
5172706	5188517	So you get Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Drift, Sonic Chaos, Sonic Labyrinth, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Spinball, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, which is another version of Puyo Puyo, Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic Drift 2, Tails Sky Patrol, Sonic Blast, and Tails Adventure.
5189657	5189938	Done.
5190885	5191165	Get it?
5191705	5192046	All right.
5192126	5192566	Check it out.
5192626	5195027	Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast.
5195287	5198728	And didn't they remake this game, put it out again, like on the GameCube or something?
5199089	5199929	That's what I was saying.
5199949	5200089	Oh, yeah.
5200109	5201189	Talking about the GameCube version.
5201209	5201570	There you go.
5202470	5202710	Okay.
5203350	5203710	There you have it.
5203731	5204691	Your classic game of the week.
5204811	5206832	And we'll have another one next week for you guys.
5206852	5208132	In the meantime, we're going to take a break.
5208433	5212594	And when we come back, we have a little bit of news in Part B. But mostly you guys.
5212634	5216476	We're going to be doing the mailbag and some quick calls tonight.
5217597	5220819	and we also want you guys to do this during tonight's break.
5221120	5224963	We're going to be putting together the Orange Lounge Radio Top 3 Games of 2008.
5226544	5230587	So if you want to participate, all you need to do is send in your votes right now.
5231248	5244018	Your Top 1, 2, and 3 game of 2008 using any criteria you want and I'll compile it all together during the break and we'll have ourselves a list that myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and maybe Brad, even though he said he didn't play anything this year,
5244338	5248924	Maybe we can get them to think of three games, and we're going to do that, as well as a list list later tonight.
5249405	5251448	So go ahead and send me those games, and we'll tally it up.
5251488	5253110	Make sure you label it, though, one, two, and three.
5253591	5257596	And don't send me other private messages, because they'll get lost amongst the other tabulation.
5258057	5260841	So we'll do that, and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5267711	5268151	and DarkSakura.com.
5288579	5298590	So, anyhow, we got more news to get into, just a little bit, but then we're going to get into some year-end wrap-ups and talk about our favorite games of 2008, as well as the biggest stories of the year.
5299110	5300152	Lots and lots to talk about.
5300592	5303135	Let's kick it off with a little bit more news from this week, though.
5303155	5307579	It was a surprisingly busy week, considering it was a holiday and everything, but stuff going on, right, Loki?
5307599	5307680	Yeah.
5308160	5319222	Yes, according to CNET, it looks like Microsoft is wanting to add to the user experience and design for the Zune group.
5319842	5331084	And they're going to focus now on the Zune user interface, a Zune PC application used to access the Zune marketplace, and the Zune Xbox application.
5331945	5333805	What exactly is this application called?
5334940	5335861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5365782	5366983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5380967	5381667	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5398238	5406102	Also interesting, this collaboration we're hearing about, it's a rumor, take this with a heavy grain of salt right now, but remember the game Deus Ex?
5406523	5408104	Remember that game?
5408704	5409544	They had like two games?
5410425	5411786	No, I think there were two games in that series.
5413046	5415548	I think I remember checking it out on GameTab a long, long, long time ago.
5417982	5421564	The whole series was designed by this guy, Warren Spector.
5422585	5433053	What's very interesting, he said at one point, I guess way back in June 2007, that he was working on a new project and folks would tell him that he has sold out.
5433833	5436355	At least that's what hardcore gamers would say, that he sold out.
5436735	5437416	Apparently...
5439511	5441112	Epic Mickey Mickey Mouse Mickey Mouse
5465387	5465847	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5494360	5495260	I don't know.
5518928	5520450	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5538470	5540251	GS68 says Mushroom Kingdom Hearts?
5540872	5541612	It's a nice thought.
5542092	5544814	And maybe it's a Nintendo Wii game.
5545175	5546676	I mean, you want to talk about selling out?
5547456	5550978	This guy's making a game that involves Mickey and Mario on the Nintendo Wii.
5551118	5553140	Oh my god, could they do a Mario RPG 2?
5554121	5554941	Now we're talking.
5555361	5555922	Now we're talking.
5555942	5557323	But they can't do it without Square Enix.
5557383	5559784	Sorry, because that would be epic fail.
5559864	5564868	Well, maybe it will be for the Nintendo Wii what Sony has for Kingdom Hearts, if that makes sense.
5564988	5565368	I don't know.
5567089	5567930	It could be interesting.
5568730	5569411	Could be interesting.
5570431	5576054	But I think there's a lot of in-between-the-line reading going on in this particular story.
5576574	5579316	So I think we ought to just wait until this guy decides to tell us what he's working on.
5579536	5579896	Could be.
5580637	5580917	All right.
5582117	5584999	GameGuru in chat says, Mario and Mickey at the Olympic Games.
5586764	5587444	Using any criteria we want.
5587464	5589125	That's why we don't like to say the top games of 2008.
5589185	5590465	No, they're our favorite games of 2008.
5590585	5591206	Using any criteria we want.
5615888	5618649	So if we want to put some game you think is crappy on there, too bad.
5618689	5620210	It's our favorite games of 2008.
5620410	5624512	Then I'll let you know what collectively is an OLR listenership we came up with.
5625212	5630795	DarkSakura, what was your number three favorite... How appropriate, this music comes on just at the right time.
5631355	5635537	What would you say was your number three favorite video game in the year 2008?
5636677	5637017	Rock Band 2.
5637818	5638858	Rock Band 2.
5639058	5639919	Any particular reason why?
5641959	5643080	Do I need to name them all?
5645342	5645702	Really.
5646302	5648863	It's just such a massive library.
5650944	5659106	You know, having the different instruments and everything, I just think it was... Even on top of that, you could import your list from the first Guitar Hero and it would all work.
5659426	5660126	You mean Rock Band?
5660226	5660526	Rock Band.
5660546	5661026	You know what I mean?
5661046	5661486	That's right.
5661726	5663747	Well, I was actually... This brings me to my next point.
5663767	5666008	The one thing that it did not have going for it is the guitars.
5666648	5667608	The guitars suck.
5668408	5670809	And I would only use the Guitar Hero guitars.
5672080	5677243	This is a game that narrowly missed being on my list, but I love this game.
5678284	5680786	What did you think, though, compared to the first game?
5680846	5686049	Because at first, when I first sat down with Rock Band 2, I was kind of like, eh, this feels like Rock Band 1.5.
5686329	5690332	And I think that might be part of the reason it didn't make my top three is because I do feel like it was an upgrade of what I played last year.
5690992	5693394	But there is a lot of new, cool stuff.
5695515	5701138	The multiplayer, when you make your band, you can actually save your character per your account.
5702339	5704040	And I think that's a lot better.
5704380	5708222	Because it was really irritating going back to playing the first rock band over at my friend's house.
5709183	5711944	And having to save my character on her profile.
5712985	5713805	It was really irritating.
5715146	5716907	Loki, what was your number three favorite game of the year?
5718318	5719599	Um, yeah, that's tough.
5719859	5720540	Let me need it down.
5721381	5722161	Uh, let's see.
5722201	5724183	And we're going to try to be a little different here.
5724583	5725684	Uh, Lost Odyssey.
5726444	5726905	Hmm.
5727125	5737653	Because Lost Odyssey this year was the only game that I feel is as close to Final Fantasy as we're going to have in a while until like Final Fantasy 13.
5738013	5742236	And I mean, people thought maybe Last Remnant, maybe some of these other games that had come out.
5742897	5743017	No.
5743037	5743077	No.
5743823	5748486	Lost Odyssey is the closest thing you're going to get to Final Fantasy XIII until XIII comes out.
5748886	5750607	It plays exactly like a Final Fantasy game.
5750627	5754029	And just even apart from the Final Fantasy series, it was a good game with a good story.
5754730	5756311	Another game that narrowly missed my top three.
5757471	5757691	Yes.
5758052	5760053	But I thought was still incredibly good.
5760553	5761774	Any game I need to go back and finish.
5761954	5764476	Maybe part of the reason I didn't... Yes, I need to finish it too.
5764736	5766497	I'm only like a little ways into it.
5767148	5767929	Bradley, I have no idea.
5767969	5768929	Did you make a top three list?
5768949	5770591	I don't know if you played enough games this year or what.
5770891	5774393	I actually thought of three games that came out this year that I actually played.
5774513	5774974	Excellent!
5775014	5776315	What was your number three pick, Bradley?
5776335	5777155	I have only three games.
5777215	5780838	I think I've bought like one or two other that came out this year, but I didn't get around to playing them.
5781158	5781619	That's alright.
5781939	5789925	So, number three, at the bottom of the list I've played this year, but it's not bad, but it's just DDR, it's DDRX.
5791225	5795969	And I've actually only played like a few hours of it, and the stories are weird, and
5797031	5798751	Well, would they put stories in DDR?
5799232	5801232	There's this weird thing.
5801372	5803613	They have the different stories for characters.
5804193	5813215	The first two characters, I think there's one or two characters that are unlocked at the beginning, which is, I think it's Emi, and there's a new guy named Zero.
5813795	5818657	The Zero guy, he's just like the stoic sort of guy.
5818677	5819557	He doesn't say very much.
5819597	5821057	He's kind of, whatever.
5821357	5823398	Sort of like a weird Bishonen-looking kind of guy.
5824284	5825505	Thanks for watching!
5833858	5835319	Show off your moves.
5835439	5837401	Sounds too much like you got served to me.
5838302	5839582	Yeah, it's kind of silly.
5840143	5840483	All right.
5840863	5841624	Well, you know what, though?
5841644	5850070	I'm glad DDR is represented somewhere on the list because we did start up as a Bomani-based radio station, so why not?
5851351	5855614	My number three game that I would pick on the list of the top three games that were released in 2008...
5857936	5858657	Thank you for watching!
5879938	5880919	and DarkSakura.com.
5903030	5905572	DarkSakura, your number two favorite game of 2008.
5922313	5927896	My number two game would be Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
5927916	5929716	Any particular reason why?
5930097	5936419	Dude, it's freaking... I only really played as Ken and Jun because I'm the big Gatchaman fangirl.
5937080	5938040	But it's really cool.
5938080	5941722	It had actually so many different touches that...
5943512	5949935	If you're fans of the old Tatsunoko series, it's just like big fangasm right then and there.
5950396	5954317	So many good touches, except for the happy thumb ball of doom.
5955398	5958900	I hated the happy thumb ball of doom, but the rest of it was pretty freaking fun.
5960280	5963842	It's just like playing Marvel vs. Capcom in its control.
5963942	5964562	It was really cool.
5967824	5970925	Some folks in chat room are asking, was Rez HD really this year?
5971005	5971946	Yes, it was January 30th.
5972961	5973341	There you go.
5974182	5976185	It was early this year, but it was.
5976685	5983553	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, a game I didn't spend a whole lot of time with, but I was surprised at how decent it was.
5983613	5985715	We were kind of all thinking, oh, this is going to be a little crappy.
5986176	5986776	I wasn't thinking that.
5989479	5994201	The characters we knew were going to be good, but you know you've heard of projects like these and you go, oh boy.
5994702	5996242	It's kind of like games based off movies.
5996362	5998604	You're always kind of like, oh boy, these are going to kind of stink.
5998924	6001085	But the game was surprisingly decent, so I can see that.
6002045	6003226	Loki, your number two game of the year.
6004326	6008568	My number two game of the year... Man, that's tough.
6009429	6014311	I would... I guess I'm just going to have to go with Saints Row 2.
6015652	6016592	Alright, Saints Row 2.
6038798	6054032	I thought a little bit better than or more fun for me than Grand Theft Auto 4 even though I still play Grand Theft Auto 4 today and that is pretty fun especially now that I can mod it but it was an overall fun game and I really can't wait for the next one to come out.
6055205	6057406	Saints Row 3 in 2010, maybe.
6058047	6058347	Alright.
6059508	6059828	Awesome.
6060448	6065091	We know you never shut up about that game on the show, so it's no surprise that it's showing up on your list, but that's cool.
6065171	6066512	Sandbox games can be a lot of fun.
6067332	6069293	Bradley, number two, for you.
6069453	6083361	This game had the unfortunate circumstance that I picked up a Zelda Phantom Hourglass and didn't get back to it, but since it's another game that I played this year, it's Sonic Chronicles The Dark Brotherhood.
6083681	6084462	I only got through like
6084841	6085181	SONIC CHRONICLES
6104298	6105879	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6128160	6130668	You know, that whole games is art thing.
6130889	6135322	I mean, the game just moves like a painting, has a surprisingly...
6136721	6137341	DarkSakura DarkSakura
6166019	6167801	I'd say Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
6168902	6171644	It's been pissing me the hell off, but I've been having the most fun with it.
6174767	6179192	It gets back to what made Symphony of the Night fun.
6180433	6183876	Even though that game frustrates me to no end, it was pretty cool.
6184897	6187980	Loki, your number one favorite game all freaking year.
6190676	6201504	I'd normally go with Grand Theft Auto 4, but actually I'm going to have to say LittleBigPlanet, just because it was just a fun game.
6201684	6208929	It's hard to really pick one game, but LittleBigPlanet, this is definitely a game I could see myself playing months from now.
6209169	6211971	So, I'll have to go with LittleBigPlanet.
6212791	6214272	Alright, LittleBigPlanet.
6215533	6218475	Lots to do in LittleBigPlanet, lots of replayability value.
6219945	6221886	Bradley, your number one favorite game of 2008.
6222247	6227910	And it's actually not even maybe, not exactly a game, but it has games in it.
6228130	6231973	But it's what I actually have on my DS right now, playing.
6232133	6233434	It's My Japanese Coach.
6234074	6235495	And I'll let it speak for itself.
6236556	6237036	Sugoi.
6237716	6238157	Sugoi.
6238177	6238637	Sugoi.
6239117	6239638	Sugoi.
6240638	6241599	Sugoi.
6241819	6242299	Sugoi.
6243440	6243920	Sugoi.
6245751	6247453	Hey, apparently it's amazing.
6247513	6248774	That's what I love about this show.
6248834	6252217	You really can use any criteria you want.
6252257	6256341	So if you want to put My Japanese Coach as your number one game of the year, you go ahead.
6256582	6257563	Yeah, it's good for learning.
6259432	6261394	I actually recommend it if you want to learn Japanese.
6262474	6269538	If you're just starting out, you probably want to have some help or get into a class, but this would also be good to help along.
6269759	6275242	Especially it's good if you've forgotten a lot and need to get back in, get your skills back up.
6275942	6277683	A shout out for the educational games.
6278264	6278624	There you go.
6279685	6281486	All right, my number one game of the year.
6281927	6282307	You know what?
6282327	6284229	You've been listening to the show long enough.
6284469	6285550	You know me well enough.
6286151	6286732	What do you think?
6286992	6288133	My number one game of the year.
6288373	6289054	This shouldn't be hard.
6289194	6290015	Super Metroid.
6291637	6293478	Maybe about 15 years ago, yes.
6294279	6295981	Or number one game of all time, maybe.
6296241	6297362	Loki, I know you've got to know.
6298964	6299865	Sing Star Abba.
6301018	6301818	Thank you for watching!
6317706	6318166	Try again.
6318366	6320027	If I'm being serious, what do you think the number one?
6320567	6321307	LittleBigPlanet?
6321427	6322247	Absolutely right.
6322287	6324928	LittleBigPlanet is my number one favorite game of 2008.
6325628	6330249	Because I think this game is amazing.
6330289	6337831	Despite all the hubble we had about the moderation that went on earlier this year, I mean, God, I wouldn't even need half of that.
6339071	6342574	Those user-created levels and the game itself, even by itself, is amazing.
6342614	6344435	And I'm having a wonderful time with it.
6344995	6348258	And the potential that this game has for expansion is awesome.
6348438	6351060	And now that they gave Sackboy a gun, it's even better.
6351720	6353942	And this game is amazing.
6355022	6356103	So I love LittleBigPlanet.
6356143	6357144	It's my number one game of the year.
6357833	6358793	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6376061	6376901	Here's the interesting thing.
6376961	6386685	If we were to put our list together with the chat room, there would be a tie for the number one game of 2008 with LittleBigPlanet, because Loki and I naming it as number one game of the year probably helps.
6387165	6387726	But get this.
6387766	6388966	You know what the other number one game would be?
6388986	6390247	It would be one none of us named.
6390687	6392928	Mega Man 9 would be the game of the year.
6392988	6393588	That's worthy.
6394639	6395939	Super Smash Bros.
6396220	6397880	Brawl, Rock Band 2
6418143	6423425	So even though somebody named Rock Band 2, nobody named the other ones, and those were very well-loved amongst our listeners.
6423505	6430007	Brawl, probably the Wii title to have this year, and Left 4 Dead, which, you know, as far as shooters go, has been pretty amazing.
6430387	6433348	And then third place would be yet another one we didn't even name, Fallout 3.
6434389	6443312	But, you know, obviously the topic of that's come up earlier in the show, and at least for me, that's one of those games that I'll get to it when it comes down in price a little later on after I finish these other games I want to play.
6445871	6447333	So, there it is!
6448134	6449155	Your favorite games of 2008.
6450436	6453480	Very interesting to see some of the other things that people picked.
6453620	6460808	Castle Crashers, DJ Max, Wii Sports, somebody put in their list, even two years later, shows you the staying power of a game like that.
6461128	6465713	Gears of War 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Fable 2, uh...
6468220	6478668	Castle Crashers, Tomb Raider, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Chrono Trigger DS, Bioshock, Mario Kart Wii, NHL 2009.
6478828	6480969	The list goes on and on.
6482511	6482971	Very nice.
6484692	6486073	Pretty good year for games overall?
6487174	6487854	I would say so.
6488775	6490617	I would say yes, unless you're the Nintendo Wii.
6490937	6496561	I think the Nintendo Wii had maybe one or two great games on it, and the rest was shovelware, in my opinion.
6497887	6499448	Loki, was it a good year for games in 2008?
6499488	6499808	It was okay.
6499849	6501630	It was okay.
6502490	6505873	All right, let's see if it was a good year for the mailbag.
6506293	6517442	Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com and we read some of your mail right here on this program in a little segment we appropriately call The Mailbag.
6524367	6527269	Well, we've only got one email, just one.
6527699	6529780	Thanks for watching!
6549349	6550189	DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
6579498	6585348	gave it a thumbs up or thumbs down and limited this to only the popular or big title games that came out.
6585388	6590656	For example, I remember that Sky recently let LittleBigPlanet, but I can't remember what DarkSakura said about Animal Crossing.
6591511	6592792	It was the same, by the way.
6593992	6600215	Even if not all of you played the game, I still value each of your opinions because you guys never seem to lead me astray.
6600576	6605538	I'm not proposing an entire archive of what everyone nitpicked about every single aspect of each game.
6605758	6611881	I'm just looking for an easy and preferably online way to find out if you approved of a certain game before I go and get it.
6612241	6613242	Just something to think about.
6613302	6615423	I hope your holidays are awesome, Amplitude.
6615964	6616605	We'll see you next time.
6633784	6634565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
6656657	6673245	Well, I will tell you this, that Sauce actually has a review blog that we've talked about some reviews on there before, but it's at Avengers-Tower.com, I think it is.
6674925	6676366	and she puts up a lot of reviews there.
6677526	6691250	I was actually kind of thinking about getting back into blogging some game related stuff since I'm actually playing things a bit more and actually since I'm chatting with her she suggested get a Gamefly account too.
6693057	6699261	If you guys know anyone who's really good at website design, and I mean really serious inquiries only... Oh, there's no Dash in that, by the way.
6699782	6700642	Just Avengers Tower.
6700842	6701903	Please send them my way.
6702744	6710909	I'm not talking about hosting or admin, because we have a guy who does that who is amazing, but I'm talking about the design itself of a website and being able to run it.
6711930	6715953	I would even be willing to throw money out there if it's not too extreme.
6716053	6717474	So get in touch with me.
6717894	6722197	A lot of times, and maybe you've tried to before, but it fell through the cracks because we get a lot of freaking spam.
6722677	6724379	But I'll try to keep my eye out over the next week.
6724519	6732707	If you have ideas on how we can get OLR's website functional for types of requests like this, I would love to hear it.
6733027	6737972	Because unfortunately, with a full-time job and school and stuff, we just got no time.
6738012	6739773	Were we using WebMatter before?
6740634	6743136	We're still using PHP Nuke, and it's an old system.
6743156	6745759	No, I meant for our old blog that we used to have.
6746398	6747318	Old blog?
6747338	6750019	Yeah, remember the blog that we had up way back in the day?
6750039	6750359	Oh, God, yeah.
6750379	6751920	I think it was called Grey Matter or something like that.
6752480	6752960	That was old.
6753640	6757641	We could probably throw up WordPress easy, but I don't know.
6757661	6758802	WordPress was what we used.
6760622	6763643	We could just try reviving that, too, but...
6764127	6766629	PhpNuke We just need a website that looks less less
6789848	6791208	Our strength is radio, guys.
6791469	6792609	That's the thing you've got to learn.
6793309	6795490	Radio is what we've done for seven years, not website design.
6795530	6798671	Hey, I can update PHPBB, so don't worry about that.
6799451	6800371	I did my own board.
6801031	6801331	Awesome.
6803012	6808553	I'm going to give it a refresh just to see, but you know what?
6809434	6809774	No.
6810414	6810714	All right.
6811794	6812294	That's all right.
6812314	6813175	How dare they?
6813215	6818056	Probably because I've been very behind on updating the podcast again and, you know, oops.
6819463	6823628	I will resolve in the new year to get us all caught up in current again.
6824689	6825670	So, hooray.
6826551	6829314	Let's move on with a couple more news stories.
6829414	6829814	Just a couple.
6829834	6831116	And then we're going to do Listless tonight.
6831136	6832337	We haven't done Listless in forever.
6832657	6833298	This will be fun.
6834139	6834820	Listless tonight.
6836189	6837810	Top three news stories of 2008.
6838830	6841632	Top three news stories will be tonight's list list.
6841692	6842172	It'll be fun.
6842212	6843813	It'll be quick, too, because there's only three of us.
6844033	6844994	And then we got Skype, too.
6845054	6845474	Don't worry.
6845614	6846194	We'll have Skype.
6846594	6847435	We'll have plenty of time for that.
6848635	6849216	Loki, news.
6850424	6852185	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6870005	6874006	Do the financial situation that they're in and that kind of stuff.
6874126	6882448	And their forecasts that they're going to not really continue development on it.
6883008	6886529	The current market environment and the forecasts for the future.
6887430	6890350	And of course, they apologize to everybody that was waiting for the release.
6892031	6892511	But too bad.
6892932	6901696	Yeah, I think this was a game that they were showing off, I want to say, either the very first year of 360 came out, or maybe a little bit after.
6901716	6911020	It's basically, what was it, a team that composed of Miss Walker and R-Toon.
6912101	6912301	Yeah.
6914213	6915755	What's Mistwalker been working on lately?
6916495	6918137	Are they doing Lost Odyssey 2 and Blue Dragon 2?
6918177	6920299	Well, there's a Blue Dragon DS game.
6920319	6920760	Oh, yeah, that's right.
6920780	6923382	I think there's some other Mistwalker game that's coming out.
6923803	6925485	They're working on a few things, I remember.
6925825	6927827	They've already confirmed a sequel to Lost Odyssey, though, right?
6929127	6929747	I think they did.
6930267	6930748	I think they did.
6931508	6931788	We'll see.
6932789	6933749	Hey, follow-up, too.
6933789	6936370	Remember last week, we just had depression upon depression.
6936410	6938751	All these studios were closing left and right.
6939551	6943293	And some of them were rumor status, and one of those was Free Radical.
6944033	6952857	Unfortunately, it has been confirmed that as of December 31st, Free Radical is going to be downsizing significantly.
6953577	6955758	75% of its workforce, 140 employees.
6956138	6957879	That means only 40 people will be left.
6958419	6959500	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6985635	6994884	Well, you know, just the countless news upon news articles of studios shutting their doors is just one of the big things that happened in 2008.
6994984	7003472	But we thought we would take a look tonight at some of the top stories of 2008, the way that only we can do it here on Orange Lounge Radio in a segment we call...
7008462	7008902	That's right.
7009062	7014947	Here on Orange Launch Radio, we do a segment called Listless, where we invite everybody to submit their top three... I'm sorry, we don't invite everybody.
7014967	7023153	We invite the hosts to submit their top three, and then we have the chatroom vote on the list that is prepared, and come up with the ultimate list.
7023253	7026735	And today's topic is the top three stories of 2008.
7027456	7034281	Now, what's interesting tonight is that I don't believe Bradley is going to be able to participate, because I don't think he's been following enough stories this year to be able to tell us.
7034301	7035082	He's shaking his head no, so...
7035822	7037203	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
7058536	7059797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7077170	7080693	He who shall not be named loses his license to practice law in Florida, correct?
7080733	7080813	Yes.
7081293	7081793	All right.
7082314	7087998	That was a pretty monumentous occasion that involved confetti being tossed and hoorays everywhere.
7088878	7089139	All right.
7089679	7092141	DJ Dark Knight says, let the chatters kick one out.
7092961	7093342	I don't know.
7093642	7096944	Should we let the chatters maybe put like one thing on the list so we have a nice even ten?
7097465	7097765	Sure.
7098085	7098385	All right.
7099706	7100247	I'll do this.
7100347	7104390	At a certain time, I'm going to open up the Skype line and we'll let you guys put one thing on the list.
7105771	7106071	All right.
7107028	7108109	Loki, you're number three.
7108929	7109950	Oh, man, that's tough.
7113291	7117073	I guess because we talked a lot about it.
7121836	7126338	I guess it would be funny if Rock Revolution, Konami announcing that they're doing Rock Revolution.
7127219	7128719	No, that was actually the year before last.
7129140	7129980	Or was that this year?
7130000	7130460	I can't remember.
7132148	7135289	This E3 was the one where they really botched it publicly.
7135910	7138031	You might remember, so maybe you want to use that.
7138051	7139291	No, take that up, take that up.
7139331	7139611	I got it.
7139991	7142853	Nintendo fucking up their E3 press conference.
7147615	7148335	Care to elaborate?
7149976	7154337	Yes, their demonstration of Wii music and how it butchered the Super Mario Bros.
7154417	7154758	theme.
7156718	7159840	Stories about snowboarding and Sun's...
7163141	7168562	What was the other thing that they showed that was really crappy?
7169483	7171203	Oh, Animal Crossing and how it wasn't different.
7171683	7175164	Yeah, GameGuru in the chatroom asked a question a lot of people are going to ask you.
7175284	7175464	What?
7175524	7175965	Fuck up.
7176305	7177945	Some people would say they did not fuck up.
7178825	7180966	Okay, disappointing showing at E3.
7182346	7184007	Clearly they had the worst press conference.
7184387	7190449	They were supposed to make this big splash to kind of come back for ignoring the core gamer and
7191371	7193960	They pretty much ignore the core gamer.
7194080	7197611	Alright, we said anything you want.
7198834	7200895	TigerCross says, how about the drummer pretending to drum?
7200935	7202717	So you do have some allies in your corner there.
7204017	7213644	My number three that I would put on the list, I would say the story, and I don't know if you remember this, but part of the reason I'm putting it on the list is because of the endless lulls that it brought us on this show.
7214184	7218147	But do you remember when a website called WhatTheyPlay.com ran a poll?
7218887	7228514	And this poll discovered that people out there are more offended by sex and gay kissing than multiple uses of the word fuck and disembodied heads.
7229054	7231235	And I'll see you next time.
7250883	7251523	DarkSakura.com
7283442	7283902	Thanks for watching!
7307091	7309113	So we've got a free write-off of them, huh?
7309433	7312776	And easiest way to get some of those achievements because the song is so short.
7313878	7314718	Just want to point that out.
7316140	7319603	Loki, your number two top news story of 2008.
7320344	7323747	Just because it was funny to make fun of how ridiculous everything was getting.
7324367	7325909	The Little Big Planet Controversy.
7326409	7330954	Seriously, a song with lyrics that most people won't understand.
7332071	7333591	Can't possibly get offended by them.
7334412	7335552	What was up with that?
7335632	7341134	Like, seriously, the guy had won Grammys and does this stuff all his time in his albums and nobody had ever had a problem with it before.
7341474	7346995	And even the guy who complained about it was like, I didn't mean to, like, recall the game.
7347095	7348896	You could have just, like, patched it out.
7348916	7349296	Panic!
7349396	7349856	Panic!
7350056	7350416	Panic!
7350456	7350816	Panic!
7350876	7351256	Panic!
7354157	7355578	This is the new motto at Sony.
7355618	7357678	Whenever we talk about Sony headquarters, Panic!
7357718	7358058	Panic!
7358098	7358518	Panic!
7358699	7358879	Panic!
7361007	7362869	That's right, the crayon eating leads to panicking.
7363589	7366912	Do you think that maybe there's some chemical in, like, the crayon that causes people to panic?
7368393	7369374	I've died in before!
7371856	7378542	Alright, my number two was going to also be the news story about Nintendo burning their hardcore gamers at E3.
7378982	7380523	But since Loki stole that...
7382986	7388971	I will say the news that E4ALL got canned and Old E3 is coming back.
7389391	7393274	Because I think it goes to show a lot of people said, it wouldn't work, it wouldn't work.
7394015	7399078	And as much as they're trying to say, well, you know, we tried something different, da-da-da, it didn't work.
7399939	7402941	So Old E3 is returning, is my number two story of 2008.
7403762	7405503	Old E3 returning, bye-bye E4ALL.
7406043	7409266	Where did E4ALL not work out, do you guys think?
7410046	7410607	Everything?
7412225	7422835	I think that it was a good concept, but because there was already this expectation of what was there before, it really did rub raw with a lot in the community.
7423636	7434607	And really, I think, a lot of the hype was really, really brought up at the big E3 orgy.
7434707	7436148	I'm sorry, it was the orgy of game.
7437129	7440590	So that really actually cut down a lot of advertising for them, I thought.
7440750	7443371	They had a Target booth where you could buy games.
7443591	7448552	Oh my god, where will we find a Target on, I don't know, anywhere in the United States?
7449732	7451073	Oh wait, no, they're everywhere, that's right.
7451833	7455694	So yes, of course you need to go to E4ALL to go buy your games.
7456924	7461709	GameGuru wants to point out in chat that Capcom, he believes, was the worst at E3.
7462149	7463871	At least Nintendo talked about actual games.
7464051	7464792	That's a good point.
7464812	7470857	Capcom got up there and sucked their own dicks for an hour, basically, is what they did.
7473780	7477083	Which you'd think would be an impressive thing to watch, but in fact it was really boring.
7478186	7478766	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7498544	7501125	GameGuru says E3 is for the casual gamer and movie lover now.
7525851	7528052	I don't know, do you think having to go back to the old way?
7528112	7528393	Somewhat.
7528433	7531274	I mean, we say it the old way, although they say we're going to cap it at $40,000.
7531334	7534376	They say they're going to make it easier for podcasters to get in.
7534796	7537178	And I'm saying, I'll believe it when I see it.
7537898	7539119	That's some bullshit right there.
7540039	7544942	Maybe other podcasters that have done... Why podcasters if you're an IGN podcaster?
7545042	7545322	Exactly.
7545342	7546283	Which, by the way, they have, like,
7546443	7547003	DarkSakura.com
7575549	7582122	Alright, I promised that we would allow a listener to add something to the list, so we're going to the Skype line right now.
7582162	7582803	Who's on the line?
7583865	7584907	This is Aki Ripper!
7584987	7585929	Aki Ripper!
7586009	7587031	How are you doing, my friend?
7588474	7589634	I'm doing just fine.
7590094	7590454	All right.
7590494	7595255	Like the small, tiny detail that what the hell do I have to add to this?
7599156	7600236	Well, you got through.
7600836	7605877	You called when I said to call and chat, and I said a chat room person could add one item to the list.
7606157	7607898	So we are about to start our number ones.
7608278	7612639	So Aki Ripper, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?
7612859	7613759	Any criteria you want.
7614813	7624937	Well, the only thing I can think of at the straight really is the dissemination of that one who shall not be named.
7625597	7628918	So, I fail per automatic, sorry.
7629159	7633740	Oh, well, yeah, and that's already on the list, so you're not gonna try and add something new to the list?
7633780	7634601	What would number two be?
7637542	7643084	I'm... I really gotta be... I am so really behind, and...
7644639	7645139	Gua!
7647861	7649022	Pardon me, I just failed.
7649122	7651424	Was there a game called Gua that was released this year?
7653565	7655127	Guar is a band, I know that.
7655747	7657268	Alright, Ake Ripper.
7658129	7658949	I'll have to let you go.
7659029	7659590	Call back later.
7660270	7660551	Later.
7660831	7661131	Alright.
7663152	7664473	People so excited to call in.
7664894	7665874	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7665894	7666275	Who's this?
7668066	7668727	Hey, it's Jason.
7668747	7669367	Hey, it's Jason.
7669688	7670268	Hey, it's Jason.
7670288	7670669	Hey, it's Jason.
7670689	7671129	Hey, it's Jason.
7671169	7671950	Hey, it's Jason.
7690259	7691680	Okay, sorry, technical difficulties.
7691700	7692061	That's right.
7692301	7693522	Jason, that's good news for you.
7693582	7695864	That means you can put on whatever you want onto the list.
7695904	7699767	So what do you think was the top news story of 2008 in gaming?
7699987	7703310	I'm going to be a little bit egotistical with this one because of how everything went out.
7704011	7707894	The new Metal Gear Solid will be an iPhone game.
7709235	7711497	Oh, so something a little recently here.
7711597	7711958	Okay.
7712338	7714060	Why do you think this is such a big freaking deal?
7714680	7717462	Give me one moment so I'm not echoing all over the place.
7718783	7720504	You sound fine to us here in the studio, just so you know.
7721164	7724286	Yeah, you said that, but... You sound like a tin can, but you sound fine.
7726587	7732630	I chose that simply for the fact that people went absolutely crazy about Metal Gear Solid V, holy crap!
7733250	7734591	We've already gotten Portable Ops.
7734811	7737572	We've already gotten, what was it, Metal Gear Acid?
7737612	7738873	Am I even thinking about the right game?
7739273	7741214	We've already got Portable games, we've already got offshoots.
7741774	7744116	4 just came out, and they were really trying to end the series.
7744916	7746377	The I in the logo...
7748106	7751889	Just prime over-analyticalness, that's why.
7754571	7757534	Well, you know what's interesting is it's not just Metal Gear that Konami's putting on the phone.
7757574	7769863	If I recall, they also announced DDR and some of their other big franchises on iPhone, so to me this is more of a story about that iPhone is starting to legitimately become a gaming platform of sorts, as much to Loki's dismay.
7771024	7772906	Yeah, Konami Mobile, yeah, that sounds about right.
7773547	7776488	Yeah, but they already had cell phone games, so that's a gimme, I'm sorry.
7777128	7781190	Well, not Metal Gear, hence my real reliance right on that.
7781450	7781890	Alright.
7782291	7784872	Yeah, but this isn't really a good Metal Gear game anyways.
7785912	7788413	Some interesting comments in chat.
7788513	7790294	Bob Copy says Metal Gear Touch will fail.
7790854	7793435	Pitstun says Metal Gear Touch is a glorified light gun game.
7793755	7796316	GameGuru says Metal Gear Solid Touch should be on Wii.
7797197	7798757	So should the Silent Hill arcade game.
7799097	7799838	That should be on Wii.
7800818	7806123	Alright, well Jason, thank you so much for contributing to the list and we'll see what happens if the chat room votes that it's one of the top three.
7806783	7807784	Hell yeah, you guys better.
7808024	7808665	Alright, we'll see.
7809025	7809286	Bye.
7809866	7810166	Thanks.
7810827	7815571	Alright, let's go around and get our in-studio, our number one picks for biggest news story of 2008.
7815731	7818894	DarkSakura, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?
7820055	7821236	The biggest news story?
7821456	7824399	I'd actually say our pair of anniversaries.
7825379	7825880	How so?
7825900	7827181	For the station, seriously.
7830048	7831128	Any criteria you want.
7831168	7837813	It's really big for us because we not only hit 300 episodes, but we hit six years.
7838853	7840715	So I'd say that's fairly monumental.
7842920	7843700	We're that bored.
7846861	7858585	You know, I don't know if there is another, and if I am mistaken, please feel free to correct me, but I don't think there is another show that runs weekly that has hit 300 episodes in the history of the internet.
7859285	7859665	Of gaming.
7860786	7861266	Hey, DarkSakura,
7888866	7889727	It's so true, though.
7890128	7894214	All right, no, you know, we do it because, you know, what else would we do?
7894674	7895035	Crack?
7896397	7896757	Loki!
7897691	7905795	Well, since that was going to be my number one Winners don't use drugs But that was going to be my number one because I did dress up like a sack boy then That was going to be your number one, really?
7905815	7923784	Micah, y'all are getting Capcom on me Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen I have a better number one though because this small event happened In May of 2008, Activision announced that Guitar Hero, which became Guitar Hero World Tour, would now have drums
7925689	7927131	and would now be copying Rock Band.
7927532	7936045	It would be the first music game in the history of music games to have drums and guitars in the same game.
7936706	7938328	Oh wait, except that's inaccurate.
7938548	7939530	But that's what they said.
7940411	7940912	Or something like that.
7942484	7953066	Uh, meaning, like, how, uh, they got up there, I think, and said, like, this is the first time you're gonna be able to get to play the guitar and play the drums and sing at the same time, all in one game.
7953506	7956807	And everybody's just thinking, like, uh, lol, rock band.
7957127	7959927	Well, I think they meant in the Guitar Hero series, but, yeah.
7960007	7962748	Yeah, but, you know, you know how them suits are.
7963988	7966908	They like to think that we're all ignorant, which is not true.
7967868	7968068	So.
7968829	7970889	Alright, uh, my number one, I mean...
7971954	7976618	I decided to pick something I actually think is the number one thing that happened this year in gaming.
7976658	7981481	Like, huge news, I think, that changes gaming in a big, big way.
7982102	7986365	And do you guys remember I've been talking about something that I said was going to be huge for gaming?
7986665	7991368	It was announced early in the year and then happened, and I'm saying it's going to be like the YouTube of the 360.
7991629	7992930	Singstaraba?
7993030	7994411	No, not Singstaraba!
7996312	7998894	Community games on the new Xbox Experience.
7998994	8000415	The fact that they brought in community games.
8000495	8001296	Not just that!
8001877	8015585	But Netflix, so I'm going to kind of loop it all in and say the new Xbox experience I think is the biggest news story of 2008 because it brought us not just the community games and the, you know, web 2.0-age of my 360, but the fact that I can freaking stream movies to my 360.
8016626	8019567	That just bumped up its entertainment capacity by a ton.
8019907	8020388	You know what I mean?
8020448	8027232	Not just a gaming system, but a movie hub, you know, an entertainment system, really.
8027352	8030434	So, NXT is my number one story of 2008.
8033547	8041596	But I want to specifically state it's because of community games and Netflix and not necessarily because of stuff that was just to kind of catch up to other companies like the avatars.
8041656	8048264	And, you know, there are some things about NXT I don't like, but I do think those two particular aspects make it very, very relevant.
8049585	8052068	Sorry, I know you would think SingStar ABBA would be there.
8052108	8053810	Maybe if I got to do a top five, I don't know.
8055290	8055590	All right.
8057351	8061452	So, since we're skipping an elimination round this time, you guys get to vote on this as it is right here.
8061472	8064933	I'm going to post this in the chat room there, and you can send in your votes.
8065173	8066834	Prepare for fluttage in chat.
8067854	8068154	All right.
8068495	8074297	So, you can place a vote for your number one and your number two picks in the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
8074337	8075917	These were the top ones.
8076417	8077798	Jack Thompson getting the beat down.
8078398	8081579	Nintendo fucks up the E3 press conference, as Loki said, fucked up.
8082299	8083800	Whattheyplay.com asshattery.
8084920	8107887	Steven Colbert is in Rock Band LittleBigPlanet, Koran Lyrics and The Controversy Notice that's Koran, not Korean Old E3 is coming back by E4ALL Metal Gear goes to iPhone OLR hits 300 episodes in 6 years I love how that's mixed in with all these other stories Guitar Hero announces drums and NXE Community Game and Netflix

8109588	8115031	Send your number one and number two picks via private message to Sky in the chat room.
8115371	8117813	While you do that, we have some more news for you guys.

8119114	8120134	Please hurry and get those in.
8120835	8121775	Loki, we'll start off with you.
8122216	8123476	Yes.
8123857	8132082	Speaking of games with guitars and drums, Rock Band 2 for the Wii is finally going to get some download content.
8132762	8138864	Starting in early 2009, they're going to be, I guess, adding that feature to it as well.
8139244	8143265	And they're going to start with the content that was originally available.
8145225	8148446	I think the free 20 song pack or whatever.
8150066	8152227	So, that'll be interesting.
8152967	8155128	Oh, that's cool.
8155548	8158989	Yeah, free 20 song pack, I guess, that was available already.
8159009	8159829	And then the free...
8162349	8179385	30 download tracks from the original Rock Band download content library very cool so free songs for the people that bought Rock Band that's right because we people have to wait for a while well actually no I guess not because it just came out like last week or so so that wouldn't be too bad
8181693	8182894	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8208499	8208759	Nothing.
8209399	8210619	I'm very surprised.
8211280	8211760	Me too.
8212280	8213040	I am very surprised.
8213200	8215601	I'm very curious to see how the download content is going to work.
8215681	8216921	That is going to be very interesting.
8217501	8218401	Very, very interesting.
8219541	8219901	All right.
8220702	8221282	More stories.
8221462	8221682	Yes?
8223082	8223522	There is.
8225263	8226303	Actually, this is pretty cool.
8227743	8231984	For Rock Band, they're actually getting some new content.
8232744	8236285	Actually, they're getting Roy Orbison.
8237844	8238684	How's that for cool?
8241085	8242066	Who's Roy Orbison?
8242206	8243426	It seems kind of random to me.
8244647	8256611	Well, this is actually reported by CMT, but they're actually putting in a pack of Roy Orbison songs that are going to be on Rock Band 2.
8257931	8258492	They would know.
8259052	8260713	Didn't he do You Got It?
8261693	8262033	Yeah.
8262913	8264934	They would know because CMT is owned by MTV.
8265134	8266175	He sang Pretty Woman, right?
8266195	8266675	Yeah, he did.
8266715	8266875	Yeah.
8267639	8268539	Pretty Woman.
8268579	8269740	That's probably the song that's going to be there.
8270180	8270681	Just you wait.
8271441	8272261	Roy Roberson's cool.
8272561	8275183	Plus he was with the Traveling Wilburys, and that was pretty cool.
8276644	8282266	Well, Guitar Hero's going to be getting some more free download tracks in the form of two...
8284795	8311584	Bruce Springsteen tracks apparently let's see the Born to Run and My Lucky Day I guess My Lucky Day is off his new single and Born to Run of course is a classic track and those will be available on both PSN and Xbox Live Marketplace January 27th through February 4th alright
8312585	8313566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8338150	8339831	There are cookies, actually, here in studio.
8340032	8340312	I know.
8340892	8350399	See, you left them here, and I was going to eat them all, but then I thought, what a good idea to keep cookies in studio on hand for those moments when Jamie says, I need a cookie.
8351820	8354843	That's not going to actually happen after the beginning of the year, Rob.
8355463	8355603	Why?
8355623	8357124	Are you going on a diet?
8357985	8358886	I don't go on diets.
8359106	8360407	Are you going on a lifestyle adjustment?
8360427	8362668	I adjust my lifestyle, and that's exactly what I'm doing.
8363549	8363989	I'm re-adjusting.
8364029	8366111	Will there be a type of cookie you can still eat?
8367321	8368115	Um, Fiber
8368777	8369697	All right, fiber cookies.
8369837	8371978	All right, fiber glass cookies.
8372118	8375979	All right, if you hear a crackling noise, it's because I picked up a call like a minute ago and the poor guy's having to wait.
8376019	8376920	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8376940	8377260	Who's this?
8377980	8379581	It's GSX-K and no acidic.
8379641	8381261	I am not ordering a pizza for OLR.
8382222	8384782	Yeah, please don't order pizzas to the studio if you know where we live.
8384802	8385363	That's not nice.
8386523	8387883	GSX-K, what's on your mind?
8388304	8395366	Now, I think I know what's on your mind because you live in a certain part of the Bay Area where you got something special this week, right?
8395406	8398207	Yeah, DJ Max Signica at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
8398496	8402378	Tell us about DJ Max Technica's Sunny Max, Sunny Max, Sunnyvale Golfland.
8402418	8403098	What's it like?
8403918	8408360	Yeah, basically, it's got, it's kind of like Elite Beat Agents meets Luminous.
8409300	8417044	You have two halves of the screen, you have this line going from one side of the screen to the other, and then there's these markers you have to press as the line goes over them.
8420285	8425587	And it's kind of like beat meaning that as you press the markers, you recreate parts of the music.
8427288	8427508	Yeah.
8429827	8430648	But will it blend?
8430828	8431949	No, is it fun?
8432009	8432689	That's what I want to know.
8432749	8433209	Is it fun?
8433330	8434330	Did you have fun with it?
8434450	8436732	It's pretty fun.
8436992	8447220	On the first day, we had like 20 people in line, so between turns, I had to wait 20 games, which wasn't really a problem for me.
8447240	8448861	I just played other games between rounds.
8449021	8452123	My god, isn't that like a three-hour wait, 20 games?
8452263	8453104	No, at least an hour.
8453644	8454865	Well, it depends.
8455425	8458808	The problem is the life meter on the game is very harsh, like
8459525	8488153	if you miss like seven to ten notes in a row you automatically fail and it's not like say poppin music where if you fail the first stage you can still go on to the next plus like on the final stage like the difficulty progression like from one stage to the next is really hard like on the first stage you can pick a level one song but on the second the lowest you can pick is level three i think and for the final stage the lowest you can pick is a level five so but third stage you have songs that
8488903	8493724	Initially, you have a lot of trouble with any end up failing within the first 30 seconds.
8493744	8495225	Well...
8514415	8518138	And you know that Konami sued Rockstar for Indie Groove in one, right?
8518199	8518859	Sure, yeah.
8519660	8527907	Well, I mean, personally, I think the whole Indie Groove thing had it coming because it was basically DDR just with different music and charts and, like, some modifiers.
8529088	8534933	DJMAX, I have different opinions for because at least it stands out to be different from Beatmania.
8534974	8537556	Like, for example, DJMAX Portable, that...
8538334	8542317	I mean, Konami's hasn't really done a portable 2DX.
8542497	8548441	I mean, yeah, there's the Game Boy Beat Minis, but from what I hear, those aren't really good, and they weren't very popular.
8549501	8565792	Whereas with... Portable's... DJ Maxx Portable, I mean, it was like... It was so successful that it initially became its own series, and... So, we just kind of have mixed feelings about this lawsuit, I mean...
8566983	8567563	Yeah, it's a lot.
8567784	8569405	And DJ Ranma S is a lot.
8569745	8576430	But at the same time, I don't know if... I don't know if PandaVision really deserves this.
8576490	8582794	I mean... You know, I gotta say though, you get us thinking about something.
8582834	8586957	I gotta say, you have a well thought out point because you got me thinking about something I didn't think about before.
8587858	8590660	Because, like, I...
8591909	8592429	In the Groove was DDR
8622338	8624161	Anyone in studio think that changes things at all?
8638277	8642598	I guess it could be used as, you know, you could play DDR on it.
8642778	8646979	Well, kind of like that Stepmania thing for PSP, right?
8646999	8647659	That's what I was saying.
8648019	8651900	Yeah, you can play DDR on it, but a lot of people would be like, what's the point?
8652700	8653040	Thank you.
8653140	8653681	What is the point?
8653741	8656301	I never understood the point of DDR on a portable platform.
8656901	8659862	Well, on the go, I mean, sometimes you can't.
8661272	8688748	or you can't take your pad and such with you but here's the thing though before I remember talking to a Konami rep one time about when they were planning on bringing over Guitar Freaks and this was like a long time ago and they're like well unfortunately they don't know how to you know they don't know how to market a guitar game for the US you know whereas like a DJing game oh people want to play you know
8689229	8689909	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
8717475	8720616	I don't know, it would be kind of cool, maybe like a Beatmania game or something like that.
8720696	8721656	Yeah, wait.
8722596	8727977	Yeah, there was a pump and a dim on the PSP, but that also, but that tanked, as far as I'm concerned.
8729217	8730758	Because what is the fucking point?
8731138	8731758	I mean, really?
8732498	8734439	Beat and Groovy on the PSP?
8734459	8737019	I don't know, maybe.
8737059	8738639	Oh, PSP and Groovy, oh gosh.
8739080	8745741	I mean, Beat and Groovy had a lot of potential, I mean, I can understand why it's only five buttons, but, I mean...
8746977	8750138	Whoever was behind Beat'n Groovy just handled it really poorly.
8750178	8752099	I mean, the songs are too easy.
8752759	8757000	They went out of their way to replace all the awesome poppin' music characters.
8760522	8761482	God, you are so right.
8762222	8766404	That's what's so frustrating about Beat'n Groovy is that Beat'n Groovy did have a lot of potential to be a really awesome game.
8767144	8768344	Oh, wait, they already have that game.
8768384	8771285	It's called Poppin' Music, and it's superior in every way.
8772306	8773766	It's insulting.
8773866	8776387	What Konami did with Beat'n Groovy is insulting.
8777185	8779466	to us people that have been supporting them for so many years.
8779566	8781466	I'm sorry, there's really no other way to describe it.
8782727	8790229	Well, I mean, I can understand the rationale behind the 5Bot mode, but, like, the lack of songlist and such, I mean, hell, look at the US version of Beatmania.
8790369	8805674	That had, like, at least 30 songs ranging from really easy to really hard, and aside from that 5K Beatmania mode, and the new difficulty system and the racism, which, isn't that really big of a deal?
8805714	8805954	I mean...
8807282	8811263	At least it was pretty faithful as far as the basics go.
8811323	8814765	Whereas being Greer, like, what the fuck is this?
8815525	8818006	Alright, GSECA, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
8818026	8821027	But thank you for the review of DJ Maxx Technica.
8821227	8824508	And I definitely will be going to the Bay Area at some point to check it out, I promise.
8825548	8826909	I might be there as soon as next weekend.
8827269	8829810	I have stuff going on in South Bay next weekend anyway.
8829870	8830570	I might swing by.
8830590	8832491	Let me know on Twitter.
8832551	8832811	I have
8834738	8836179	Free Time Ball next week anyways.
8836499	8841981	The problem is I have to take my female friend with me who thinks video games are stupid, so I don't know how I'm going to entertain her, but we'll think of something.
8842361	8843082	Oh, alright then.
8843182	8843422	Alright.
8844202	8844682	Alright, see ya.
8844862	8845143	Bye.
8858462	8861064	Yeah, my friend that goes with me doesn't get the video game thing.
8861445	8862706	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8863466	8866609	I have returned to spam up the airwaves even more.
8866809	8869412	Please do, Jason, what's on your mind?
8869912	8871374	I wanted to talk about something earlier.
8871574	8875457	I don't even remember what it was, but something else just hit me, so I'll kill time with that.
8875597	8875777	Sure.
8875878	8880582	Is it just me, or was this a year of classical throwbacks?
8882401	8885204	Well, yeah, look at what game topped our list.
8885324	8890129	I mean, if we didn't put anything on the list, Mega Man 9 would have won amongst the listeners, hands down.
8891430	8894854	That's a pretty good definitive pick, and that is what I mean.
8895014	8902161	I was basically just going to elaborate and say, sure, years back, Nintendo has resold their whole catalog, but that doesn't mean anything.
8902481	8906122	This is the year of Mega Man 9, Braid, and I had another example.
8906282	8908763	Is it gaming or is it Capcom?
8908903	8921126	Because, you know, the biggest ones I think of, Mega Man 9, Bionic Commando Rearmed, which was pretty damn impressive, and Super Street Fighter Turbo HD Remix Super Uber.
8921386	8922966	I can't believe I paid $10 for this version.
8923606	8925447	The movie, The Game Man, in a mystery third style?
8925507	8925727	Yes.
8929545	8941076	I mean, Capcom was one of the biggest offenders in this category, but at the same time, I think Capcom finally started doing the games this year, but we wanted them to do these downloadable games when they first came out.
8942077	8942677	Yeah, yeah.
8942937	8943218	In a way.
8944144	8946306	But also, you know, a game like LittleBigPlanet.
8946906	8949969	What's the first thing people do in LittleBigPlanet's level creator?
8950509	8952531	Remake World 1-1 for Mario Brothers.
8952631	8954112	Yes, make Mario LittleBigPlanet.
8954152	8955213	I was going to say porn.
8955854	8957255	Or porn, but you know what I mean?
8957415	8958616	They'll make the cock level.
8958756	8965842	A large majority of those levels are, you know, remakes of other games from another day in this newer engine.
8966362	8969045	So there definitely is a big retro vibe going on in 08.
8970270	8977531	I don't know if you guys have gone back and actually watched it, or actually looked for it, but you remember the Gradius level that the Japanese guy made?
8977891	8978071	Yes.
8978852	8979872	Everybody was talking about.
8981132	8982672	Just in case, I just referred to it by name.
8983052	8985513	The level name was Libidus.jp.
8986073	8988873	He has made SuperLibius.jp.
8989674	8992214	It is a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up.
8993154	8994494	Ooh, I'm going to have to check his levels.
8994554	8997895	I haven't looked at it in a while, but that guy does some amazing shit in LittleBigPlanet.
8998536	9005142	It's interesting because he has, yeah, he did all of the Beatmania type level and, no, not a math level.
9005563	9005843	Anyways.
9008305	9012389	There was another weird one, I think it was supposed to be based off some Japanese shooter, but I didn't understand it.
9012649	9018075	But now, like, that they've given an actual paint gun, like, I'm curious to see what he does next.
9018255	9018755	You know what I mean?
9018815	9021258	Like, that's a huge, that's a huge extra mechanic they've put in the game.
9025523	9031346	The only thing that I don't like about this Super Libius is that at the same time it adds a very interesting twist.
9031546	9039811	But if you're getting shot at and you shoot that bullet, the two bullets bounce off and fly in the other direction.
9040451	9041472	And fly in opposite directions.
9042453	9044053	And like I said, it's a vertical scroller.
9044354	9053839	He has this, if you think of really, really old vertical shoot-em-ups, he has a crosshair that's not even a quarter of the way up the screen, permanently fixed right in front of your ship.
9054960	9059723	There are ground, quote-unquote, enemies shooting at you that you can't destroy.
9060023	9060784	What was that game?
9060824	9062525	There was a game on the NES that had that.
9062565	9063285	Was it Xanax?
9063485	9063926	Xevious?
9064846	9066487	You had that crosshair permanently fixed.
9067007	9068408	You might be thinking Zaxxon.
9069048	9069749	No, not Zaxxon.
9069769	9070589	I thought it was Xevious.
9070970	9072450	Xevious, with the little blue landers.
9072791	9073411	Was it Xevious?
9073851	9074131	I think so.
9074151	9075992	Because that target showed you where the bombs would drop.
9076273	9076513	Yeah.
9076633	9077533	Yeah, that's what it was.
9077854	9080435	As you were describing it, I thought it was Xevious.
9081956	9082056	Huh.
9083186	9083906	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9113639	9114559	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9131994	9132274	Break it.
9132654	9133014	I don't know.
9133134	9134935	If I break the monitor, then I'm not going for the show.
9135955	9140676	Being the fact that I've never been much of a WoW person, I can't offer an MMO person, rather.
9140696	9141757	I can't really offer much advice.
9142317	9142717	That's all right.
9142897	9143737	I'll get to it someday.
9143897	9145738	I do have a lot of fun when I play a little bit of Planet.
9145758	9146818	I'll get to a level at some point.
9147418	9147658	All right.
9147698	9153000	Well, Jason, we're going to let you go to try and get a couple more calls, and we have to read the list list results and see if you're suggesting me the top three.
9153320	9155661	You guys have better voted me in.
9155721	9156561	At least number two.
9156681	9158842	I can respect a certain one for number one.
9158882	9160122	We're about to find out in two seconds.
9162239	9163019	Alright, see you, Jason.
9163460	9163820	Bye, folks.
9165221	9166702	Our fearless webmaster, Jason.
9166942	9168102	VXJasonXV.
9168903	9169723	Jason for short.
9172445	9175006	Let's talk about the winners, shall we, of Listless.
9175046	9177067	Don't worry, we'll get back to the phone and do a couple more calls.
9177087	9180909	Let's get to the top three based on your votes.
9183171	9185192	Hold on, I have to add it up here so I don't read it wrong.
9186860	9189601	Okay, there was definitely a very definitive top three tonight.
9189661	9190681	No ties, no nothing.
9191121	9193162	Very easy top three spelled out here tonight.
9193482	9195782	The number three top news story of 2008.
9197743	9198543	Actually, I'm curious.
9200063	9203204	Folks here in studio, provided you didn't look over my shoulder.
9203544	9205805	Any predictions on what they thought was the number one story of 2008?
9207265	9207645	Cookie.
9208425	9208785	Cookie.
9208845	9210346	I don't think that was on the list, DarkSakura.
9210366	9210526	Loki?
9210586	9210846	Cookie.
9212361	9217269	I'd say either our 300th episode just because they're kissing ass or Guitar Hero.
9218011	9218331	Alright.
9218952	9219293	Bradley?
9220194	9220575	Any thoughts?
9221176	9223019	No?
9223180	9223961	Alright, let's see.
9224341	9224682	Let's see.
9225383	9226165	Alright, um...
9227321	9229122	The number three biggest story of 2008.
9229922	9230922	This is definitive.
9230962	9231842	This is absolute.
9231862	9232683	There is no arguing.
9232983	9234623	This is a flawless process.
9235483	9239485	Jack Thompson getting the beat down was the number three pick for the biggest story of 2008.
9239585	9241625	Oh, I'm sorry.
9241665	9242565	I said his name out loud.
9242585	9243466	That just gives him power.
9243506	9243706	Sorry.
9244922	9245843	Oh, but not in the state of Florida.
9245863	9251486	The number two biggest story of 2008 in gaming.
9252326	9256289	The new Xbox experience brings us community games and Netflix.
9256889	9257429	There you go.
9258450	9263593	And lastly, the top story of 2008, the biggest story in gaming.
9265274	9269416	Orange Lounge Radio hits 300 episodes in six years.
9269596	9270957	You narcissistic bastards.
9273652	9276474	Hey, it is monumental, like I said.
9277054	9280236	We are that full of ourselves.
9283378	9298246	I just love that the chat, you know, it just goes to show our live listeners and the podcast listeners too, the whole family here at OLR, everybody that helps make this show a success, everybody has to spank their monkey sometimes.
9298346	9301008	Everybody contributes to that in one way or another.
9302412	9309077	Jason's going ape shit in the chat room and not letting people talk because they didn't vote his as the top three.
9309477	9311698	I will say though, Jason, yours did get some votes.
9312619	9314720	It would have come in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7th.
9314820	9315180	No, 6th.
9315661	9320644	It would have come in 6th out of the list.
9321224	9321685	So there you go.
9324646	9325067	Jason.
9325727	9326247	Very rude.
9327008	9329930	Alright, it's rude to silence those who disagree with you.
9331243	9333344	All right, let's do another call.
9336464	9341025	Orange Launch Radio's username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.
9341365	9343426	We'll do like one more call, then we will wrap up.
9344046	9346307	For live listeners, no afterbirth tonight.
9346367	9350047	Sorry, guys, we got a late start, so we have jobs to get to tomorrow.
9350387	9352368	We're already well after midnight on the East Coast.
9353985	9361090	So, we're not going to do an afterbirth tonight, but do stay tuned because I do have a special message for you after the show, just for the live folks.
9362211	9363012	Let's get to one more call.
9363052	9363873	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9363893	9364213	Who's this?
9365474	9366735	You know, Legend of Zaku.
9367555	9368316	Legend of Zaku.
9368376	9368856	What's on your mind?
9370598	9377943	Nothing but just gloating, just looking back at what was once this year and the next few days will be the next year.
9378984	9381606	Yeah, this year has gone by really fast.
9384657	9388560	What do you think of the list of the biggest stories of 2008?
9390662	9393365	I guess it was pretty much concise of what happened.
9393385	9398390	I guess Jack Thompson's disbarring should have been up there pretty high.
9398991	9399551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9419212	9420193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9437622	9438843	Keep talking about him.
9439564	9444629	Besides that, obviously, you know, Final Fantasy, you know, 12 and 13 on the 360.
9444689	9446171	That was the biggest.
9447573	9451657	That right there would have been the, you know, the big summer surprise right there.
9452285	9455827	It was almost like jaw-dropping that it came out of nowhere.
9474995	9481379	I think at some point during this year, Capcom came out and said, look, the only way we're going to make our money back is to put our games out on all the platforms.
9482140	9487583	And ever since then, in my opinion, this news has not been as shocking.
9487623	9488103	But that's just me.
9488123	9488824	But think about it.
9488884	9496989	When Square dropped that bombshell over E3, that was a critical blow to the PS3's exclusivity.
9497469	9501272	The only thing they have now is Metal Gear Solid 4 and first-party exclusives.
9502108	9515631	and, you know, so it pretty much gives, you know, people less, you know, less of a reason to get a PS3 in the first place since there's no, you know, big ticket games, you know, exclusive for their system, you know, aside from the ones made by Sony themselves.
9516618	9522700	So it's like, why should I get Final Fantasy XIII when I could get it for my 360 easily?
9523160	9526461	And rack up on the achievements and whatever other features they may have.
9527102	9528262	Because the controller sucks?
9528622	9528962	I don't know.
9529923	9533024	But yeah, you see the argument I'm trying to make, right?
9533544	9534264	No, I do, I do.
9534524	9535064	It was huge.
9535284	9535725	It was huge.
9536265	9537705	And Hits done agrees with you in chat.
9537745	9541106	The FFXIII announcement was the top story of the year, no doubt.
9541827	9545528	Square could pull it off, you know, in terms of making, you know...
9546448	9562819	that version, Final Fantasy 360 version on the same level as the PS3 then they'll be raking in shit loads of money because of the tens of millions of users that make up the 360's install base.
9563459	9571845	So it's like in that way they see a bigger picture in terms of how much money they're willing to make.
9572545	9575167	Everything else, every loyalty be damned.
9577970	9582232	Alright, well, um, Zaku, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and try to wrap up the show?
9583212	9588855	Uh, Steam and their sale this week, please, please get your, get Bioshock for five bucks.
9589375	9591836	You won't be disappointed.
9592476	9595938	Might as well go to Steam right now and just, like, get your cheap-ass games.
9596658	9598299	Alright.
9598339	9598739	Let's go.
9599499	9602741	Alright, a quick plug for Bioshock here before we close out the Skyplane.
9603101	9603821	Zaku, have a good one.
9604642	9607343	Have a good new, have a good one, have a good, you know, new year.
9607694	9608414	Happy New Year!
9610335	9610615	Alright.
9612616	9614837	Alright, we are going to try to wrap it up here.
9616637	9618338	And close up shop for the night.
9619038	9621859	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
9621879	9631583	Remember, hey, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about Orange Lounge Radio because word of mouth is really the biggest way for us to spread word about the show.
9632143	9634384	So we would really, really appreciate that.
9635084	9635325	Alright.
9637208	9639629	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9639689	9642811	DarkSakura, your final thought for this last OLR of 2008.
9644032	9644972	Reject false icons.
9645873	9646273	Well said.
9646553	9654738	Loki, PayPal's awesome to dump these stupid little gift cards that I have left with like $5 on each one of them and I can't really spend them in one place.
9655098	9656679	It says, donate the money to myself.
9657859	9658079	Nice.
9658199	9659620	How'd you donate money to yourself?
9659960	9662782	I created a donate link for myself and paid with credit card.
9664863	9665103	Nice.
9665123	9666244	Uh...
9667577	9670019	Arcadian 42, Bradley, whatever your name is.
9671480	9672401	No, thank you for being here.
9673181	9675903	And what is your final thought?
9676564	9679226	My New Year's resolution to play the games I bought this year.
9679846	9680326	All right.
9680727	9683409	Me too.
9684109	9692075	My final thought for this, the last show of 2008, kids, your pancreas is a much more important organ than you might have thought before.
9693436	9694117	Just so you know.
9695798	9697700	Alright, that's going to do it.
9697760	9700663	Thank you guys once again for supporting us throughout 2008.
9701023	9702885	Will you come back and do it again in 2009?
9705508	9705828	Maybe.
9706369	9706949	Sure, what the hell.
9707229	9708130	Alright, see you next year.
9709102	9711784	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
9740006	9740851	Thanks for watching!
