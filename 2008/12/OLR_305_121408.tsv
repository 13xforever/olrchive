684000	689880	Oprah, Gayle, Stedman, Dr. Phil.
689880	691560	You might be able to flesh out the cast there.
691560	693840	Sj100Matt says Shaq Fu versus Capcom.
693840	695240	Alright guys, that's enough.
695240	697000	That's enough versus Capcom jokes.
697000	698000	I'm done.
698000	702240	Anything else you've been playing this week, Loki?
702240	707420	Grand Theft Auto IV on PC, and it's still, it's weird, because I tried upgrading the
707420	713760	RAM on my PC to four gigs, even though Windows can only see, like, two of it, but I was going
713760	717800	to do it anyways, and I had a bad run with bad RAM from Fry's.
717800	722240	Apparently, Fry's, they keep taking back, my defective RAM is just a stock return, and
722240	726640	so they have, like, four that they keep swapping out, even though it's defective.
726640	730680	So I stopped buying RAM there, because it's pointless, and it would have been too much
730680	735080	of a pain in the ass to get, you know, to see it on my computer.
735080	741320	So and that's being said, yeah, I haven't really been playing too much of Grand Theft
741320	745640	Auto IV, since it's still kind of buggy, even though they patched it a little bit to fix
745640	750880	some stuff, it's not enough, it doesn't support SLI yet, and that kind of pisses me off, because
750880	754560	that's, you know, I spent the money for an extra video card, I want the games to fucking
754560	761320	see it, and I mean, come on, it's like a standard nowadays, it's just lazy, damn lazy is what
761320	762320	it is.
762320	766720	Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, then my gaming week, kind of a lot of
766720	770360	the same usual stuff, I've obviously been playing a lot of The Wrath of the Lich King,
770360	776520	I have done a big, big thing in WoW this week, I respect for a long term basis, because we're
776520	780560	so short on healers, just on the server in general, not just our guild, but the server,
780560	786360	I'm no longer a boomkin, but I'm now a resto tree druid, and it's been a whole different
786360	790000	game trying to play it as a healer, but I won't bore you with the specifics, and I think
790000	792640	we have a WoW story coming up later.
792640	796040	Also some other things I've been playing, some old standbys, Rock Band 2, I downloaded
796040	799720	the new No Doubt album, because I like fun pop music, and then, you know, the nice thing
799720	803240	I like about the album they picked by No Doubt is that they just picked the greatest hits
803240	808000	album, so you don't have a lot of, you know, songs that you don't really know, and that's
808000	811480	the problem with some of these album songs, is that in a party setting, they don't work
811480	816400	very well, because you don't really know the songs, usually, that weren't, you know, the
816400	821440	radio hits, but the cool thing is the No Doubt album, like, it's all songs you'd probably
821440	825600	recognize if you listened to the radio in the 90s and early 2000s at all.
825600	827560	So I had fun with that.
827560	830640	I checked out Meteos Wars, I only checked out the demo, so I don't want to really review
830640	833520	a full game based strictly off the demo.
833520	837240	Graphics were a little minimalist in the stage I played, however, it's a fairly faithful
837240	838240	translation.
838240	842960	I was wondering how you would have the speed of the stylus in a game like Meteos Wars,
842960	845480	but the way they did it was kind of neat.
845480	850160	Instead of sliding the pieces up and down, you use triangle to move a piece up a row
850160	854640	really fast, and you use, what, X, I'm sorry, triangles would be a PlayStation, I'm sorry,
854640	855640	Y.
855640	859760	You use Y to move a thing up really fast, you use A to move it down really fast.
859760	864520	So that I thought was a neat way to control it, and it actually made the game pretty playable,
864520	869360	but it's so different looking at it on a TV than having the pen in front of you, like,
869360	871320	you really have to think about the game a different way.
871320	872320	But it was fun.
872320	876500	I probably will buy the full version a little later on, especially now that I finally got
876500	883180	a bigger hard drive for the Xbox 360, I finally am replacing my 20 gig with a 120 gig drive
883180	887200	after all this time, so I can rip some of my games to the drive.
887200	891300	As far as other new games go, I did spend a little bit more time with Prince of Persia
891300	892560	on the PlayStation 3.
892560	895080	This is the brand new one by Ubisoft.
895080	900440	It's very famous because it's kind of, I would say it's kind of left the old Prince of Persia
900440	905560	games, like the Sands of Time, and look at those games behind, and now they have this
905560	909880	more cel-shaded, I guess you could say like Okami type of art style going on.
909880	913600	I don't know what you'd really call that, but it's a very different art style.
913600	917920	And you know, I'm not usually a big fan of these platformer games.
917920	921080	I actually really like Prince of Persia, I've had a lot of fun with it.
921080	925480	I've kind of kept playing it, it's kind of held my interest.
925480	930320	The scripting in the game is a little silly, but it's, you know what I mean, like it's
930320	933800	got a silly sense of humor, but it's funny, you know, I don't know if you, did you play
933800	934800	much of the game at all?
934800	936800	I haven't played it at all yet.
936800	940120	It's cheesy but good, you know, for a video game.
940120	947800	And yeah, the thing I like about it so far is that it really does help out idiots like
947800	952120	me in platformer games, because I'm really horrible at these 3D platformer games, you
952120	953120	know?
953120	958520	I grew up in a day where it was all 2D, you know, Mario Brothers, Super Mario World, and
958520	962280	all this, and even the old school Prince of Persia is 2D, it's taken me a long time to
962280	963480	really get used to 3D.
963480	966400	I even still have problems with Mario 64, ok?
966400	969720	But the thing I like about Prince of Persia is that they've done things in this game that
969720	973880	make it really accessible to noobs, because like, the game really holds your hand for
973880	975840	a long time.
975840	979760	And what I also like about it is that even if you fall off a cliff, you don't really
979760	980760	die.
980760	984840	You have the chick as a crutch to kind of save you.
984840	988560	And you know, I think a lot of hardcore gamers have been really turned off by that, but for
988560	992360	me, I've kind of appreciated it, and it's kind of made me want to continue to play,
992360	997240	because I don't lose massive amounts of time, because I don't know how to turn the freaking
997240	998240	camera.
998240	1001800	And that's what Tigerclaw says, says, Sky, what about the fact that you cannot die in
1001800	1003280	the game?
1003280	1006640	You know, I suppose you have to kind of take that with a give and take.
1006640	1009520	Again, for someone like me who gets really frustrated when I have to go all the way back
1009520	1013080	in a game, I kind of like that fact.
1013080	1016240	But I do realize, you know, the other side of it, that there's the challenge people that
1016240	1020080	say, well, where's the challenge in it if you don't die, if you don't ever die?
1020080	1024160	And I don't know, progress still feels a lot like challenge to me.
1024160	1028120	You have to collect things, and you don't have to collect everything, you get light
1028120	1029120	seeds.
1029120	1032560	And you don't have to collect them all to progress to new areas, but you get a sense
1032560	1038840	of accomplishment for collecting them all, so they've done other little things with it.
1038840	1041360	I kind of enjoy it.
1041360	1043920	I would recommend folks check it out.
1043920	1047200	I thought kind of the fighting was fun, even though it was a lot of button mashing, but
1047200	1048440	it's kind of cool tricks.
1048440	1053480	And you know, my roommate and his partner, who neither one of them really play games,
1053480	1056040	they were kind of watching me play Prince of Persia, and kind of like, oh, what's this?
1056040	1057040	Oh, this looks neat.
1057040	1058920	What is this you're doing?
1058920	1061840	So it's kind of fun.
1061840	1066380	Achievements are really, really easy, though, too, I noticed, at least, or the trophies
1066380	1067380	or whatever.
1067380	1069960	I noticed I unlocked a silver trophy really easy.
1069960	1074520	I didn't have to do hardly anything, so kind of interesting.
1074520	1078000	So that was pretty much it for new games I played this week.
1078000	1081360	I'm hoping that I'll probably actually play Prince of Persia a lot more, try to play through
1081360	1082360	the collision.
1082360	1087320	They thought it was a Final Fantasy game, and I'm like, no, there's no, you know.
1087320	1091520	I was going to ask you, did you try out Home?
1091520	1092520	Did I try what?
1092520	1093520	Home.
1093520	1095800	Yes, I did try Sony Home.
1095800	1097400	I did download Home.
1097400	1101340	I played that for a little bit.
1101340	1108200	You know, Home is one of those things that I think it was a really great idea, but this
1108200	1113800	execution that we're seeing of it is kind of not that great.
1113800	1114800	You know what I mean?
1114800	1120900	Like, God, if you think Xbox Live is bad, the minute I logged into Home, I just started
1120900	1123880	hearing every naughty word in the book.
1123880	1125760	Just everything you'd hear on Xbox Live.
1125760	1131200	I didn't even know that you could use microphones on Sony Home, but apparently you can.
1131200	1135400	So yeah.
1135400	1136400	I don't know.
1136400	1141060	And again, it was also one of those things where it kind of caused the non-game playing
1141060	1143720	people who come through this house to kind of look at the TV and go, what is this?
1143720	1144720	This looks kind of neat.
1144720	1149340	Like, they were watching me in the bowling alley, and all this stuff in the bowling alley
1149340	1150340	is really stupid.
1150340	1153440	Like, I tried playing one of the games in there, which was basically an overdone version
1153440	1157560	of Breakout, you know, like just a redone version of that, but it's all free, you have
1157560	1160960	to remember, so you can't expect that it's going to be anything that great, because they're
1160960	1165680	going to nickel and dime you, like they're trying to do with the costumes and everything.
1165680	1171600	This all being said, I do think there's potential here for something cool.
1171600	1175600	Like I think there is, like, networking potential within Home.
1175600	1179080	I'm kind of excited for the clubhouses to come out, because I would like for us to have
1179080	1182600	like an OLR clubhouse, where we could boot idiots and things like that, and I think we
1182600	1185120	could have a lot of fun with it.
1185120	1186760	Here's my thing.
1186760	1191040	Right now, it's just this clusterfuck of strangeness.
1191040	1192320	I mean, honestly, it's what it is.
1192320	1193320	I don't know how else to explain it.
1193320	1197400	Now, do you think it's fair for them to be advertising this as like a feature of the
1197400	1201080	PlayStation 3, since it is only in beta right now?
1201080	1205240	I mean, they've been having it in commercials since, what, last year?
1205240	1207520	I mean, I think that's kind of unfair.
1207520	1213720	I will answer that question, but let me address this, because I got a private message, like,
1213720	1214720	what is Home?
1214720	1218880	Those of us that aren't as familiar with this, basically, Home is like a virtual world, and
1218880	1222760	these types of things were especially big back in the late 90s, and then kind of caught
1222760	1226520	a second wind with Second Life, but like when the whole virtual reality thing first came
1226520	1230180	out, they used to have these chat programs, where you could be like a little virtual avatar,
1230180	1233480	and you walk around a virtual world, and then, you know, Second Life kind of really took
1233480	1235160	that to the next level on the PCs.
1235160	1239840	Well, this is kind of Sony's version of Second Life, where you create a little version of
1239840	1240840	yourself.
1240840	1243960	You know, you can think of me, I guess, but it's a lot more realistic, and you literally,
1243960	1249440	using your controllers, walk around an open area, where there's other people dancing,
1249440	1253920	or talking, or interacting with each other, but then you can go into, like, a bowling
1253920	1258040	alley, and you can walk up to a bowling machine, if they're not all full, which they usually
1258040	1262260	are, and play bowling with other people, and interact with them that way, or you can walk
1262260	1263260	up to an arcade machine.
1263260	1267040	So it's kind of like, you know, it's like a virtual life.
1267040	1269320	So it's kind of like a game, but it's not.
1269320	1271640	I don't know if that makes any sense at all.
1271640	1275160	It's their idea to try and, of a new networking thing.
1275160	1276160	So.
1276160	1280160	VXJSnacksV in chat says, Second Life is a construct.
1280160	1281160	Home is a construct.
1281160	1282160	All right.
1282160	1283160	So now, what was your question?
1283160	1285280	Home, is it fair to advertise it?
1285280	1286600	Yeah.
1286600	1289880	It's obvious that Sony wanted to do a lot more with this.
1289880	1290920	It's not implemented yet.
1290920	1295560	I'm not sure what's taken them so long, but maybe it's just like, again, it's one of those
1295560	1299000	things where the ideas are coming faster than the reality of being able to program it in.
1299000	1300000	So is it?
1300000	1302480	I mean, technically, yeah, they can advertise it.
1302480	1306480	I would equate it to when they advertise video games with nothing but the cut scenes from
1306480	1307480	the game.
1307480	1308480	Yeah.
1308480	1311360	But that's basically, it's kind of the equivalent of that.
1311360	1312360	To me.
1312360	1316240	I mean, it's not, it's giving a little bit of a misinterpretation, but it's not anything
1316240	1318760	anyone's already done, if that makes sense.
1318760	1319760	Okay.
1319760	1320760	So.
1320760	1321760	What about you?
1321760	1322760	Have you played Home at all?
1322760	1323760	No.
1323760	1324760	From what you've read about it.
1324760	1326880	Honestly, if you've read about it online, you've probably gotten a pretty good sense
1326880	1328240	of what it's all about.
1328240	1329240	Honestly.
1329240	1330240	Yeah.
1330240	1331240	Do you think it's fair for them to use it in advertising?
1331240	1332240	No.
1332240	1333240	I don't.
1333240	1334240	It's in beta.
1334240	1335240	It's not even done.
1335240	1336240	It's, to me, I mean.
1336240	1337240	Isn't Gmail still in beta?
1337240	1338240	Yeah.
1338240	1339240	But it's functional.
1339240	1345760	This, I would say, it's close to being functional, but it's not, it'd be like putting out a demo
1345760	1350200	of a game or something like that, and then advertising that in a commercial for, like,
1350200	1354240	you know, the PlayStation or something like that, like, play Killzone 2, oh, except it's
1354240	1355240	not out.
1355240	1357480	It's just a demo or something like that.
1357480	1358480	I don't know.
1358480	1359480	It's misleading.
1359480	1362720	Not that anyone really gives a crap about, you know, their commercials, since, I mean,
1362720	1366480	I think the sales number speaks for themselves, so, whatever.
1366480	1368020	I just think it's kind of misleading.
1368020	1371880	I think there's potential in Home, but it has yet to be unlocked.
1371880	1376440	Also, the only other thing I want to say about Home is that it's a little confusing.
1376440	1381640	I mean, the things about the Xbox and the, well, especially the Nintendo one, those are
1381640	1386240	very easy to just kind of pop into and go, and, you know, obviously neither system has
1386240	1389920	done something as ambitious as Home, but Home's kind of complicated.
1389920	1392720	Like, it took me a minute to really kind of work through the menus and everything, and
1392720	1396400	it really is, it's even more tough when not everything's available yet.
1396400	1399680	That's the other kind of bummer about it.
1399680	1403160	And Jason wants to correct that Gmail is no longer in beta.
1403160	1404160	Gmail is official.
1404160	1406160	Gmail Labs is beta add-ons.
1406160	1409560	So there you go.
1409560	1410560	Interesting comments from Chad.
1410560	1414200	SSJ100Matt says, it's like calling Windows 3.1.1 a game.
1414200	1415840	Yeah, I know.
1415840	1418720	Home isn't really a game.
1418720	1421080	It's like folding at home is not really a game either.
1421080	1422080	It's a simulation.
1422080	1424080	Yeah, it's a thing.
1424080	1427240	No, I guess you could say it's a simulation.
1427240	1428960	I don't know.
1428960	1433360	So, all right, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping
1433360	1435640	real quick, of which we don't have a whole lot of tonight.
1435640	1439280	Just, you know, always check us out on MySpace at Orange Launch Radio or Facebook at the
1439280	1440280	OL Army.
1440280	1441840	Our Twitter is OLR.
1441840	1445800	We're also on LiveJournal, Community Orange Lounge, and we always try to keep you updated.
1445800	1450160	Today and on Latest and Greatest, although it's been kind of a busy past few months,
1450160	1453840	so a lot of our internet presence has really slowed down, so sorry about that.
1453840	1457800	But we're still trying to keep you going with the show and do what we always do, and hopefully
1457800	1460600	2009 will be a little better.
1460600	1461600	Maybe it'll be warmer.
1461600	1465960	Oh, also, one thing you've got to see at home is that when you go into the theater, you
1465960	1470320	just get to see an extended Twilight trailer playing on the screen over and over and over
1470320	1471840	again.
1471840	1474040	I haven't seen it, nor probably will I.
1474040	1478200	It's very Mystery Science 3000-able.
1478200	1480200	That would be funny.
1480200	1482160	That's the type of stuff they should be using home for.
1482160	1484600	See, that's why I say there's potential there.
1484600	1486920	That doesn't necessarily mean Sony's going to ever unlock it.
1486920	1487920	I'm just saying.
1487920	1488920	There's potential.
1488920	1489920	All right.
1489920	1490920	All right.
1490920	1493200	Let's get into some gaming news.
1493200	1494920	Loki, start us off.
1494920	1500680	Yes, speaking of Sony, Sony has been seeing some hard times, and they're actually cutting
1500680	1505600	plants and, with that, slashing 8,000 jobs.
1505600	1512280	This is all supposed to happen between now and April of 2010, and Sony will cut about
1512280	1518920	5% of their electronics divisions and close a tenth of its manufacturing sites.
1518920	1523360	That's not good, especially in this tough economy.
1523360	1525560	But, hmm.
1525560	1526560	That's kind of sad.
1526560	1531560	I mean, is it just because PS3s haven't been selling well, or is it that now they don't
1531560	1534480	need these people because the PS3's already out, or what?
1534480	1537600	I think it's just because they haven't been selling well, because there's no need to have
1537600	1542040	these extra plants producing more systems if they're not selling out.
1542040	1546080	They're not having an issue with selling out at all.
1546080	1551760	Although they are, at times, hard to find, just because they keep phasing out skews left
1551760	1552760	and right.
1552760	1553760	I mean, crap.
1553760	1560480	I mean, this year alone, there's been four different skews for the PS3.
1560480	1562200	I mean, that's kind of crazy right there.
1562200	1566120	Well, that's four new skews, and that's not even including the ones that we came in this
1566120	1568320	year with.
1568320	1570760	I don't know.
1570760	1574080	This is kind of related, but it kind of goes back to what we were talking about with Home.
1574080	1576040	I really want to read this comment, because it's interesting.
1576040	1580640	Frisbee says in chat, the Dark Knight DVD has an MST3K feature in it, and Tiger Claw
1580640	1585280	says, kind of fills that out a little bit, says, actually, the Blu-ray version of the
1585280	1590400	Dark Knight has a BD Live feature that allows you to do fan commentaries using a webcam
1590400	1591840	with a PS3.
1591840	1595400	Once you finish the commentary, it gets uploaded to the servers for others to be able to watch
1595400	1597000	the movie with.
1597000	1599260	That's kind of strange.
1599260	1601360	It's neat.
1601360	1603480	That's kind of cool with the whole BD Live thing.
1603480	1605680	So I mean, that's...
1605680	1608320	I haven't really watched any Blu-rays that have the BD Live.
1608320	1611280	You know, one thing I did watch, though, was on Netflix.
1611280	1613280	I watched King of Kong this week.
1613280	1614280	Finally.
1614280	1615280	God, how long has that movie been out?
1615280	1616280	Like a year.
1616280	1620360	I finally watched King of Kong this week, which is in HD on the Netflix thing on 360,
1620360	1622000	which I thought was pretty cool.
1622000	1624580	And wow.
1624580	1627420	What an interesting movie.
1627420	1629520	That's really the only word I can use to describe it as interesting.
1629520	1631280	Certain people are kind of dicks.
1631280	1633480	The drama is still playing out.
1633480	1636280	Here's the thing, though.
1636280	1639080	God, how far do I want to get into this on the show?
1639080	1643300	Especially when we were just talking about something completely different, and I apologize.
1643300	1646320	It's very sad that people lost their jobs, but unfortunately we don't know much more
1646320	1647680	than that at this time about it.
1647680	1651120	So here we are on this whole other subject.
1651120	1657440	You gotta kind of wonder, like with this movie, how biased is it trying to be?
1657440	1662720	And I'm not trying to say that Billy Mitchell is not likely the pompous ass he made himself
1662720	1665280	to be in the movie, but I don't know.
1665280	1666860	There's something about it.
1666860	1670400	Something about the fact that they had all these cameras in just the right places at
1670400	1673560	just the right times when all these things were going on.
1673560	1681720	There's something about it that says there's some type of editing stuff going on here.
1681720	1682720	I don't know.
1682720	1685600	But then at the same time, I know a lot of our folks listen to the other shows on All
1685600	1692040	Games, and you've probably heard all this crap about the Twin Galaxies and Mr. Awesome's
1692040	1695760	been on All Games off and on throughout the years, and all this crap going on with Twin
1695760	1696760	Galaxies.
1696760	1701400	And it just kind of goes to show you, this drama has been going on for years and is continuing
1701400	1702720	even still today.
1702720	1706960	Not just with Donkey Kong, but with the official scores in general.
1706960	1711000	And it's just kind of, I don't know, it's a very ambitious topic.
1711000	1714880	But again, my roommate who doesn't play a lot of games watched most of the movie with
1714880	1715880	me.
1715880	1717720	He kind of had his head in his laptop when he was watching the movie, and he was just
1717720	1721240	kind of like, all of these people are sad.
1721240	1722240	These people are all sad.
1722240	1725800	And I'm kind of like, well, wait a minute, though.
1725800	1730080	He's like, well, not the Steve Weeby guy seems pretty cool or whatever, and his family's
1730080	1731080	pretty funny.
1731080	1735040	But most of the people in the movie are very sad individuals, like Billy and his lackeys
1735040	1736440	and all that stuff.
1736440	1737440	And I'm kind of like, well...
1737440	1741760	But Billy Mitchell actually owns his own business and makes his...
1741760	1747040	I'm saying he's still an ass, but he's a successful businessman.
1747040	1750080	Yeah, it's interesting.
1750080	1751840	Petty, yes.
1751840	1752840	He's petty.
1752840	1753840	That's a good word.
1753840	1754840	That's a good word.
1754840	1757360	But successful and not stupid.
1757360	1759840	Like the whole thing where he sends a tape in.
1759840	1761120	Did you see the movie?
1761120	1762120	Several times.
1762120	1763120	Okay, he sends the tape in.
1763120	1764200	The King of Kong was a very good movie.
1764200	1765880	He sent the tape in and all this stuff.
1765880	1769000	Like, did you notice, they have a camera at his house when he sends in the tape.
1769000	1770000	They have a camera there.
1770000	1771800	They have the camera with Grandma at the airport.
1771800	1775040	I'm kind of like, this seems all way too pre-planned for me.
1775040	1777580	That was the only problem I had with the movie, is it seemed...
1777580	1783280	This documentary was really well done.
1783280	1785320	Like almost too well done.
1785320	1786320	I don't know.
1786320	1787320	It was weird.
1787320	1798360	Well, I also do see him as being rather pompous enough to want to tape everything.
1798360	1799360	But here's the thing.
1799360	1800360	Here's what I was going to say.
1800360	1803000	And this is what I was kind of going to tell my roommate about too.
1803000	1806440	You see these kind of pompous asses in lots of sports.
1806440	1811560	Like you ever watch some of these football press conferences or wrestling or boxing?
1811560	1815960	I mean, some of us cheer on these pompous assholes in wrestling.
1815960	1817120	You know what I mean?
1817120	1822340	So in a way, I don't hate the guy or, you know, I do kind of, you know, he did come
1822340	1827720	off like a pompous ass in the movie, but you know, maybe there's more to him than that.
1827720	1828720	I don't know.
1828720	1829720	Just interesting.
1829720	1830720	It's...
1830720	1831720	Yeah.
1831720	1835280	And then you look at some of these side stories going on.
1835280	1837240	Like the whole, like, you know, Mr. Awesome Missile Command.
1837240	1842160	I never realized, I never, and keep in mind, I've been watching this whole thing play out
1842160	1843160	on all games.
1843160	1847240	I never realized that he had the direct impact on that movie by sending the guy the Donkey
1847240	1849320	Kong board that he did.
1849320	1853640	And just to kind of see, like literally, I was just kind of like, wow, a lot of this
1853640	1856400	makes sense now, what I've been hearing on all games.
1856400	1862840	Like damn, these people and their drama over scores, but I don't know.
1862840	1864280	It's all they've got.
1864280	1865280	I...
1865280	1866280	It's...
1866280	1867280	I know, I know.
1867280	1868280	I don't fault them for it.
1868280	1869280	I don't think they're sad people.
1869280	1870840	It's what they're into.
1870840	1871840	You know, it's...
1871840	1872840	I think it's just...
1872840	1873840	Oh.
1873840	1874840	I don't know.
1874840	1875840	It hurts my head to think about it.
1875840	1876840	It almost like makes you wonder.
1876840	1879160	It's like, okay, so say you have it.
1879160	1881520	And you know who I blame even more to?
1881520	1885400	It's the fucking Guinness Book of World Records, because they're not helping things.
1885400	1887960	Now putting out this stupid gaming book and stuff.
1887960	1889200	They're just egging it on.
1889200	1893260	And not only that, but they have stupid, you know, records in there, like people that claim
1893260	1897480	to have the highest score in DDR, a game that I don't think that you can have a high score
1897480	1898480	in.
1898480	1899480	It's just...
1899480	1900480	I don't know.
1900480	1901480	It's so subjective.
1901480	1902840	Forgive my ignorance here.
1902840	1903840	I don't know.
1903840	1905100	I plain don't know the answer to this.
1905100	1906100	Maybe the chat does.
1906100	1908440	Does anyone audit Twin Galaxies?
1908440	1912360	That's the only kind of thing I had with them, is that, you know, yes, you know, they talk
1912360	1917320	about integrity and all this, but obviously the movie showed questionable integrity on
1917320	1921540	the part of Twin Galaxies, whether that was creative editing or not, whatevs.
1921540	1923360	But does anybody audit Twin Galaxies?
1923360	1926160	You know, especially if there are things that are going to be in the Guinness Book of World
1926160	1927720	Records and what have you.
1927720	1929160	Does Guinness audit them?
1929160	1933440	Guinness would, because they have, like, you know, they're strict regulations for how they
1933440	1934440	do things.
1934440	1936880	I don't think they would just take Twin Galaxies' word for it.
1936880	1941000	I mean, they'd have someone standing there recording all the data that's necessary.
1941000	1944200	At least that's how they do everything else, and I would think that they would have the
1944200	1949840	same integrity, since, you know, their name, you know, has a lot of writing on it.
1949840	1950840	So...
1950840	1954480	And, you know, I understand, you know, I understand why people get all into it, because, like,
1954480	1958000	you know, I think one guy who was, like, a friend of Steve Levy or something said it
1958000	1959280	best in the movie.
1959280	1965240	This guy, my friend Steve, is the best in the world at something, in the entire world.
1965240	1969680	And true, it might be Donkey Kong, but he's the best in the world.
1969680	1971760	And you know, I can see why people get so passionate about that.
1971760	1973480	Did you see him play through the kill screen?
1973480	1974480	Yeah.
1974480	1975480	That was pretty sweet.
1975480	1976480	Yeah.
1976480	1982160	I was playing through the kill screen once, once, and I was little, so...
1982160	1988560	All right, anyhow, sorry, a total tangent that took up more time than the much-
1988560	1989680	It's a cool tangent.
1989680	1990960	It's gaming and not food.
1990960	1991960	Much sadder story.
1991960	1995640	Speaking of food, though, I ate at Olive Garden today, home of the never-ending breadsticks.
1995640	2000600	I'm sorry I didn't invite you, Jamie, I just, it was a last-minute thing, but that's the
2000600	2003240	first time I've had it since the surgery and everything.
2003240	2007880	Sorry, bad tangent, especially following a story about such horrible layoffs as Sony,
2007880	2011040	but unfortunately we don't have a lot more to tell you there.
2011040	2016160	All right, let's talk about sales, and maybe this might help explain kind of the Sony layoffs
2016160	2017160	and so on.
2017160	2022600	Some of the November numbers from MPD are in, talking about the sales, and the Wii in
2022600	2026760	November sold 2.04 million units, probably no one's surprised.
2026760	2031000	The DS in second place, 1.57 million units.
2031000	2044760	Xbox 360, 836K, PSP, 421K, PS3, 378K, PlayStation 2 is finally in last place, 206K.
2044760	2049020	So this might finally be the PS2 kind of walking out the door here.
2049020	2052360	But it's kind of strange that the PS3, you know, is-
2052360	2058920	The PS2 is definitely on its way out, it's not, I'd say maybe by the end of next year,
2058920	2064920	because I mean, looking just at what the releases are, like for example, in February, there
2064920	2069200	are three games coming out for the PS2, and that is it.
2069200	2078880	In January, I think two or three also coming out, so it's getting a lot less prevalent,
2078880	2085920	but I think by the end of next year, you'll see most games have already moved on to the
2085920	2086920	new platforms.
2086920	2091920	And we see the PSP sold more than the PS3, which is, you know, well, it's a cheaper system.
2091920	2097200	And they were also just coming out with the new PS3, or PSP 3000s.
2097200	2099600	Float Walkin' Chat says people buy PSP still?
2099600	2103880	Yeah, because, you know, they are, you know, it isn't just a game system, but it's, you
2103880	2110120	know, the whole movies and internet and MP3s in your pocket, so it's-
2110120	2111760	But they are released.
2111760	2115400	Sadly enough, a lot of the publishers are just not making PSP games anymore.
2115400	2116400	Yeah.
2116400	2120560	And a lot of games coming out is really sad, and it's not a good sign.
2120560	2122160	Why do you think everyone jumps ships suddenly?
2122160	2123160	Just sales?
2123160	2124160	Just sales numbers.
2124160	2128580	They put out a PSP version of their game, and either development takes too long, or,
2128580	2129800	you know, it just doesn't sell.
2129800	2133920	Like, I've noticed a lot with, you know, like Crash of the Titans, for example, came out
2133920	2138600	at the beginning of October on, you know, all the other systems, it came out a few weeks
2138600	2139600	later on the PSP.
2139600	2142040	You know, the PSP versions are getting delayed.
2142040	2143040	I don't know why.
2143040	2148960	I mean, I can't imagine it's that hard a program for it, but it's just, they don't sell very
2148960	2149960	well.
2149960	2150960	Their versions aren't very good.
2150960	2154000	It's just, they all have the install base for it.
2154000	2160080	People are playing DSs more, which, you know, there's a lot of good PSP games, it's just,
2160080	2161080	I don't know.
2161080	2164200	It's gonna take some really good PSP games.
2164200	2168520	It does sound like, though, Sony has some plans of what they're gonna do to maybe drive
2168520	2172020	more PSP sales, and they're definitely not giving up on it, you know, with the whole
2172020	2174600	rumors with LittleBigPlanet and MotorStorm.
2174600	2179200	You know, we know Dissida's coming out next year, probably sometime.
2179200	2182880	So those are three big games right there.
2182880	2186680	You know, I wonder if the Final Fantasy VII remake that people always have big boners
2186680	2190200	talking about on the PlayStation 3, like, you know, big fan-gasm, you know, talking
2190200	2191640	about they want it to happen on PlayStation 3.
2191640	2195080	I wonder if they wouldn't do something like that for PSP.
2195080	2196600	I wouldn't think it'd be very good.
2196600	2202800	They could bring the Final Fantasy VII, maybe redo some of the graphics a little bit, but,
2202800	2206880	you know, like a high-quality remake like you saw the little teaser video for, I think
2206880	2208160	they'll have to be on the PS3.
2208160	2209160	Eh, crazy thought.
2209160	2211520	Let me recap the ten games that sold the best November.
2211520	2215720	This gives you a really good idea of what's gonna wind up under trees at Christmas time,
2215720	2221280	and what I like about this list is it really is a mixture of big releases getting sold
2221280	2224900	on their day of release and things that are gonna be under the Christmas tree.
2224900	2230080	Number ten was Wii Music, on the Wii, which, you know, kind of contradicts that story we
2230080	2233300	had a couple weeks ago that wasn't selling very well, because it was the tenth best-selling
2233300	2235120	game in November.
2235120	2240440	Maybe didn't hit the millions and millions of expectations, but, I mean, the tenth best-selling
2240440	2242920	game out of everything that's out there, that's not that bad.
2242920	2243920	No?
2243920	2244920	Right?
2244920	2249800	Well, then also I think last, the last report we saw for the NPD numbers, it was only out
2249800	2254000	for like a week, so that's not necessarily a bad thing.
2254000	2255000	Ninth place, I'm sorry?
2255000	2259440	I was gonna say, it definitely isn't selling as well as some of the other Wii games, let
2259440	2261440	me put it that way, though.
2261440	2265020	Ninth, well, there's only five Wii games on this list, so it's the fifth best-selling
2265020	2269200	Wii games, and when we talk about what Wii games are selling, it's old shit, so, I don't
2269200	2271120	know, it's in, you know, I...
2271120	2274120	I can probably have explanations for most of these, so go ahead.
2274120	2278640	Number nine was Resistance 2 on the PlayStation 3, which, you know, is PS3's, one of their
2278640	2280360	big titles.
2280360	2282400	Number eight was Left 4 Dead on the Xbox 360.
2282400	2283400	I really need to pick that game up.
2283400	2286560	That game's been performing above expectations, right?
2286560	2287560	Yeah.
2287560	2288560	I'm doing very well.
2288560	2291840	Number seven was Guitar Hero World Tour on the Wii.
2291840	2295160	Number six was Call of Duty World of War on the PS3.
2295160	2297320	Number five was Mario Kart on the Wii.
2297320	2298320	You know why?
2298320	2299400	That game's still short-handed.
2299400	2303360	People are still trying to get it because they've either artificially made it short
2303360	2306000	for it, or whatever the case may be.
2306000	2308160	It's been hard to get in, let me put it that way.
2308160	2311400	Well, I was just also guessing that's a game that's gonna be under Christmas trees everywhere.
2311400	2312400	Oh, yeah.
2312400	2313400	That's a game that sells.
2313400	2315720	I mean, even on DS, it's still very popular.
2315720	2317080	Number four, Wii Fit.
2317080	2320240	Also another thing that's very short and hard to find.
2320240	2323060	Number three, Wii Play with the remote.
2323060	2327040	People just sell that like a remote, and hey, you get a $10 game.
2327040	2331720	That's gotta be why this game is still chopping the charts.
2331720	2333080	That's exactly why it's doing it.
2333080	2334080	It's because you get a remote.
2334080	2335840	I mean, it's an easy sell.
2335840	2340080	It's like you either buy a $40 remote, or for an extra $10, you get a game that's just
2340080	2341320	like Wii Sports.
2341320	2346040	And I bet parents everywhere are looking at this going, oh, cool, and putting it for the
2346040	2347040	kids.
2347040	2348040	Exactly.
2348040	2349040	That's gotta be it.
2349040	2352000	Number two, Call of Duty World of War, the 360 version.
2352000	2355520	And then number one would be Gears of War 2 on the Xbox 360.
2355520	2359400	But I should point out, if you add up the two Call of Duty World of Wars across 360
2359400	2362680	and PS3, that would be number one, not Gears of War 2.
2362680	2368160	But Gears of War 2 being Xbox 360 exclusive only has the one system to consider.
2368160	2371680	So just interesting.
2371680	2372680	Interesting list.
2372680	2373680	There you go.
2373680	2375120	Your November NPD numbers.
2375120	2381280	Well, for people like me who have an iPhone, there is some fun out there, although I've
2381280	2384000	been hearing mixed reviews on it.
2384000	2389280	There is I Love Katamari, which is actually I Love Katamari on the iPhone.
2389280	2395360	It's $7.99, and you can either play it on the iPhone or the iPod Touch.
2395360	2401680	And it's 82 meg, has a story, time attack, eternal and exact size.
2401680	2407200	And it apparently suffers really bad from the iPhone's poor frame rate for games, but
2407200	2411160	I figured I might download it eventually.
2411160	2413680	The last game I actually paid for was Pole Position.
2413680	2417600	I was gonna check it out, but then I read the reviews, and they all were bitching about
2417600	2418600	the frame rate.
2418600	2419600	And I was like, okay, maybe this isn't so cool.
2419600	2421320	Yeah, but that's just iPhone games anyway.
2421320	2424920	You look at any review on an iPhone game, they're gonna talk about the frame rate unless
2424920	2427800	it's something, you know, dinky like Pac-Man.
2427800	2430800	Or Labyrinth, which is what I play all the time.
2430800	2432160	It doesn't matter, though.
2432160	2436280	I don't think, that's like bitching about the frame rate on any system.
2436280	2441640	I can't say that that's a reason to even put out a game then, oh, I can't get the frame
2441640	2442640	rate up where I need to be.
2442640	2445560	Well, then you can't release the game.
2445560	2447140	You can't get it up.
2447140	2453640	You have to make some sort of, like, you know, omissions, you know, for, I don't know whether
2453640	2458480	it be, like, you just use, like, cel-shading, you know, with really flat textures, so that,
2458480	2464040	you know, the size of the textures isn't really big, and so it's able to render it faster,
2464040	2469000	or I don't know, you know, they're trying to push the iPhone as, like, this big gaming
2469000	2474760	platform, and yeah, unfortunately to me, that's almost like pushing the N-Gage as a big gaming
2474760	2475760	platform.
2475760	2478440	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2478440	2483800	First of all, games look a jillion times better on the iPhone than they did on the N-Gage,
2483800	2488000	and I had a great gaming taco, I understand this.
2488000	2493040	On top of that, there's so much more functionality with the iPhone that comparing it to that
2493040	2501640	waste of electronics that was the N-Gage is seriously, like, comparing, I would have to
2501640	2508040	say a Blackberry with one of those old car phones, you know, that you had to attach to
2508040	2511560	your cigarette lighter and was the size of your head.
2511560	2517040	Here's my thing, is they, well, they're trying to be like a gaming platform, I mean, that's
2517040	2520920	what they keep saying is, like, they're, you know, one of the best gaming platforms out
2520920	2526960	there, which, I don't know how they can claim that, but they are.
2526960	2531080	I think if, you know, it's funny, if Nintendo had almost, like, taken the same idea and
2531080	2536880	just done almost, like, what XNA is doing, and opened that up to people to release apps
2536880	2541200	for, like, the DS, can you imagine how much money they'd make?
2541200	2543200	It's just ridiculous.
2543200	2547440	But it's the same thing there, and I can't even really call them a gaming platform anyways,
2547440	2552280	because for me, a game console is something that you can actually buy games for, not necessarily
2552280	2557400	just digital downloads, and I know that's the future of stuff, but I'm just not seeing
2557400	2558400	it.
2558400	2563920	I just, I think it's more casual, I don't know, I don't think it's ever going to take
2563920	2566800	the place of a handheld game system.
2566800	2569560	I want to read this comment real quick from AlphaKananagram in chat.
2569560	2573800	I love Katamari, in its current build, is the worst eight bucks I've spent.
2573800	2574800	It's neat, but slow.
2574800	2580160	Oh, there you go, a listener review of the game.
2580160	2584240	All right, let's move on.
2584240	2588440	Okay, so some other cool stuff.
2588440	2592560	We talked about this a little bit, you know, Home has finally made its way out, or at least
2592560	2595000	the beta of it.
2595000	2604320	It is a 77 meg download, however, you do need to have, I believe, three gigs dedicated to
2604320	2605320	this.
2605320	2609200	Yeah, when you start it up, it says that you have to dedicate three gigs of your drive
2609200	2614280	to the game, and it says okay, and then you basically, it partitions off a part of the
2614280	2615280	drive for it.
2615280	2616280	I don't know what it's doing.
2616280	2617280	It reserves a part of the drive.
2617280	2620280	That's because you're downloading new areas as you go.
2620280	2621400	You can go in there and download new stuff.
2621400	2623360	I'm not sure what it's all used for.
2623360	2625520	I don't know if it's caching data or something.
2625520	2629560	I think it's storage of the actual areas and stuff like that, probably the video.
2629560	2631440	Areas aren't that big.
2631440	2636860	The funny thing is, when you start Home, okay, then you get your apartment, but then you
2636860	2640840	have to download the central area, which is like 70 megs, and you have to download the
2640840	2642960	theater if you want to go in the theater, which is 40 megs.
2642960	2645040	You have to download the bowling alley, which is another 40 megs.
2645040	2647040	I don't know why they just didn't do it all at once.
2647040	2650520	Yeah, that part did seem a little silly to me, but whatever.
2650520	2654120	You just do it, and it doesn't take that long on a high-speed connection, which you're using
2654120	2656760	to play these things anyway.
2656760	2660200	Maybe it was so that you don't download stuff you don't need, but I just figured the 3 gigs
2660200	2661200	was some type of cache information.
2661200	2664680	It's probably so that their servers don't crash from everybody downloading it all at
2664680	2669520	once, and that way, it saves them a little bit of time, and then that way, every time
2669520	2672240	it goes in there, it checks to see if there's any updates to it.
2672240	2676760	Kind of like, remember how AOL was, how you'd go to different pages and you'd download updates?
2676760	2678560	It's kind of like that.
2678560	2681120	So it is available right now.
2681120	2682440	You can check it out.
2682440	2687600	However, there are issues, and obviously, they've been having trouble with it staying
2687600	2692820	online, and they've had to actually shut down the PlayStation Network for about an hour
2692820	2695920	to fix stuff, and yeah.
2695920	2704360	So it's definitely acting like it was in beta, but it's available to check out, and it's
2704360	2705800	been a long time coming.
2705800	2710000	Weren't they having a lot of issues on launch day with the downloads?
2710000	2711000	Yeah.
2711000	2712000	Like, I heard, yeah.
2712000	2713000	But I don't know.
2713000	2717080	I got in there very easily, but I didn't remember it was out until, like, late in the evening.
2717080	2719880	I think I'd been watching a movie, and then I was like, oh yeah, I want to download Home.
2719880	2721400	Yeah, I'm not going to try it for a while.
2721400	2725960	I just haven't gotten, I'm not really gung-ho to jump into it.
2725960	2727160	It just kind of, eh.
2727160	2733920	It was like the avatars for me, you know, just like on the new Xbox experience or whatever.
2733920	2735960	It was kind of neat, made my avatar.
2735960	2740040	That's it, you know, whatever.
2740040	2741040	Question from Chatroom.
2741040	2742040	Tigerclaw asks, interesting.
2742040	2745760	Does it let you walk around the world as it downloads in the backgrounds and stuff?
2745760	2748560	It's kind of annoying when you're walking in an environment that appears empty, and
2748560	2751480	then about a minute later, everything suddenly appears, and you appear to have run into a
2751480	2752480	wall.
2752480	2755080	No, it doesn't do that with the environments.
2755080	2758000	That's why you have to download everything before you go in.
2758000	2760680	So it doesn't actually download the environment as you go.
2760680	2764840	It will download as you go, like the movie that's playing in the movie theater, like
2764840	2766400	the Twilight trailer or whatever.
2766400	2769720	You have to wait for that to download before you're going to see it on the screen.
2769720	2774160	But what's kind of sad about that is that there's nothing to do in that theater otherwise.
2774160	2778440	I mean, people are there sitting in seats talking and saying all these things you really
2778440	2780760	don't even need to read anyway.
2780760	2781760	That's just lame.
2781760	2786320	But, I don't know, there's really not a lot of point to it.
2786320	2791960	Now remember when Home was going to let me show whatever movie I wanted to on my screen
2791960	2792960	in my home?
2792960	2793960	Like, remember that?
2793960	2794960	Yeah.
2794960	2795960	We were supposed to have that?
2795960	2796960	Now that would have been cool.
2796960	2800280	Yeah, I think they got rid of that because of licensing.
2800280	2804040	I know, because you'd think people would put up porn and what have you.
2804040	2807240	No, I think they weren't even caring about porn, they were caring about people putting
2807240	2808240	up like, say, a fight.
2808240	2809440	Okay, so copyrighted porn.
2809440	2810440	Yeah.
2810440	2811440	Okay.
2811440	2814240	But imagine if we could have had an OLR clubhouse, and we could have shot like some video just
2814240	2818640	for fun that could loop in the clubhouse or something that we could have had in there
2818640	2821360	just for fun and change it out once a week or something.
2821360	2827160	That would be great, and that's potential, but I just know that's not going to happen
2827160	2828160	for years.
2828160	2837400	Now is that something like, what is it, where you have to be, do you have to be like, logged
2837400	2841600	into that, your account or something like that for someone to be able to jump into your
2841600	2842600	clubhouse?
2842600	2843600	Or is it just-
2843600	2844600	It's not available yet.
2844600	2845600	Yeah.
2845600	2846760	And you're going to have to pay for them when they do come out.
2846760	2849960	I mean, if it's just a small fee, I don't mind paying it just to kind of screw around
2849960	2854760	with it, you know, because I think there's potential to, you know, kind of have the community
2854760	2857960	there and, you know, we're all about community here at OLR.
2857960	2864240	But I want to know a little more about what you can actually do with it, because it seems
2864240	2865560	like it's going to be a little limiting.
2865560	2868480	And I don't know if I would have to be on or not, but the PS3 is also one of those systems
2868480	2871600	you can kind of just leave on, and it doesn't make any noise or nothing.
2871600	2877520	If you could, like, hook up a PS3 in here, and then broadcast our show into that clubhouse
2877520	2879520	and have us on the TV.
2879520	2880520	That's what I was thinking!
2880520	2882200	Like, wouldn't that be an awesome potential?
2882200	2883200	That would be awesome.
2883200	2887440	Like, if we could actually, because if you can talk through your headset, then that thing
2887440	2891120	supports streaming audio, and I'm sure there would be a way that during the duration of
2891120	2893560	the show we could just shut everyone else up.
2893560	2896560	We shouldn't be giving away all our ideas, other podcasts are going to steal them.
2896560	2897560	Eh, whatever.
2897560	2899440	Wouldn't be the first time.
2899440	2904200	But, you know, that's kind of like the idea I would want to do.
2904200	2909640	So there's potential there, but I don't know.
2909640	2912400	Jason says, you can create a club at home and it will cost $5.
2912400	2914000	Can you actually do that now?
2914000	2916300	When I tried to look at it, you couldn't do it.
2916300	2921680	Did they actually open that up and I just couldn't figure it out?
2921680	2923780	Tigerclaw says, this is why Second Life does it better.
2923780	2927200	You can actually create a club, invite people to come over, and the club will actually play
2927200	2930240	music in the background by streaming a shotcast stream into it.
2930240	2934080	Maybe we should have put a thing in Second Life a long time ago, but it was kind of expensive,
2934080	2935080	wasn't it?
2935080	2936080	I don't remember.
2936080	2937080	It's Second Life, I don't want to touch that.
2937080	2938080	It's like, dirty.
2938080	2939440	Well, home's not much better then.
2939440	2945240	Well, it's not much better, but it's like the new gas station bathroom.
2945240	2946440	It's a brand new gas station!
2946440	2949440	The bathroom hasn't quite gotten all disease-ridden yet.
2949440	2951200	Alright, well, let's move on.
2951200	2952600	Let's talk about other PlayStation 3.
2952600	2957160	What could have been, and according to 1UP, apparently what happened, Final Fantasy Elite
2957160	2958160	11.
2958160	2961840	Kind of interesting that it came out on the Xbox 360, but it never really came out on
2961840	2962840	the PlayStation 3.
2962840	2966880	I mean, true, you could do the PS2 backwards compatibility, but even then, sometimes the
2966880	2970600	hard drive issues would kind of get in the way, I think, depending on what system you
2970600	2971600	owned, I think.
2971600	2976360	But then you could download a patch that would allow you to play it from the PS2 version
2976360	2977360	on the PS3.
2977360	2978360	Okay, that's cool.
2978360	2983560	But at some point, they were going to release, I guess, a nicer version, I guess you could
2983560	2984560	say, on the PlayStation 3.
2984560	2987440	Probably one with all the expansions included and what have you.
2987440	2993640	Well, apparently, it was supposed to happen, but apparently, the Sony representative that
2993640	3001520	Square was working with, they were working with Hiromichi Tanaka, I guess, was just quit.
3001520	3005440	And they never really resumed talks, which is kind of strange.
3005440	3009920	Oh well, Final Fantasy 11 is still getting three new expansions next year, but not through
3009920	3011240	the traditional retail channels.
3011240	3014120	They will all be downloadable story expansions.
3014120	3019520	No new classes, none of that stuff, just story and quest expansions, which is interesting.
3019520	3022520	I assume zone expansions, too.
3022520	3027560	So yep, Final Fantasy 11 on the PS3, it was an idea, so if you wondered why it wasn't
3027560	3030000	there, somebody else must have been thinking of the same thing, but then they just gave
3030000	3031000	up.
3031000	3033000	Yeah, they didn't care, like some of us.
3033000	3034000	I guess.
3034000	3035640	I'm kind of over Final Fantasy 11.
3035640	3037840	I know you're in Other Addiction now.
3037840	3042240	Yeah, I have WoW now, but I would like to revisit Final Fantasy 11 someday when it gets
3042240	3046200	redone and has a new, like Final Fantasy 11-2.
3046200	3047200	Why not?
3047200	3048200	They did 10-2.
3048200	3049200	Why can't they do 11-2?
3049200	3051560	Maybe because they have good taste sometimes.
3051560	3052960	Oh, shush.
3052960	3056520	Well, here's something that should excite a lot of people.
3056520	3061000	I know there's a lot of our listeners out there who are fans of Fallout 3.
3061000	3070580	Well, for the PC, Bethesda actually brought out a PC toolset for Fallout 3 so that you
3070580	3076680	can, I guess, create your own levels.
3076680	3082520	You can modify and edit buildings, landscapes, dialogue characters, basically you can just
3082520	3084800	change it all up into your own game, pretty much.
3084800	3087200	That's why Logie's not all over this.
3087200	3091500	It was called the Garden of Eden Creation Kit.
3091500	3095040	I don't really mod games anymore.
3095040	3098960	I wait for other people to mod them and then add to it.
3098960	3101520	You can download it off of the Fallout 3 website.
3101520	3103520	It's 8.47 megabytes.
3103520	3111280	I want someone to do the wondrous thing that someone has done with the Half-Life editor
3111280	3115480	and make me a Hypercube version of Fallout 3.
3115480	3120320	I would like to see one where the world ended because of something Jamie did.
3120320	3122320	Mega Maniac Mansion!
3122320	3124400	Seriously, you totally could.
3124400	3125880	That would be pretty awesome.
3125880	3131920	Well, actually, I was going to say, other than all the cool stuff for Half-Life, Grand
3131920	3135680	Theft Auto IV, they have some of the first mods out there for it.
3135680	3140800	Of course, the game actually doesn't allow you to run files that are modified, but someone's
3140800	3145560	found a way around it, like it was cake or something.
3145560	3150440	And they've made pistols that fire rockets, which are pretty funny, and then also pistols
3150440	3157680	and machine guns that have really hard kickbacks to them, so you fire it at a car or something
3157680	3163640	and it actually blows the car back and blows people away like they got hit with a jet or
3163640	3164640	something.
3164640	3169160	But it's pretty funny and cool handling mods and stuff like that.
3169160	3173080	You can set it up drifting and whatnot.
3173080	3178400	So it's crazy that this game's only been out for a week or so and they've already gotten
3178400	3181160	mods and a mod system in place.
3181160	3185280	So can't wait to actually try some of these.
3185280	3188540	Haven't gone around to actually modding it yet, but that's why I got it.
3188540	3190840	So fun times.
3190840	3191840	Alright.
3191840	3202160	Now, some other cool stuff available for Fallout 3, of course, is some brand new download content,
3202160	3205240	and that'll be coming soon.
3205240	3210520	What's kind of neat about the download content, though, is they're going to be raising the
3210520	3216440	level cap on it, and you'll actually be able to...
3216440	3219520	I don't know what level they're going to raise it to, but I know right now it's pretty limited.
3219520	3225160	I think it's like 30 or something, which is kind of cool.
3225160	3231840	And then, of course, the first screenshots have been released for the new download content
3231840	3236120	where you get the fight in Alaska, which is kind of cool looking.
3236120	3237120	Fight in Alaska?
3237120	3241080	Well, it's going to be like a simulation, I guess, for one of the...
3241080	3246200	I haven't played the game yet, but some of the backstory stuff for it, which is kind
3246200	3247360	of neat.
3247360	3250240	And that should be coming soon.
3250240	3255240	I think the level cap is actually going to be the third bit of updates that they're going
3255240	3261360	to have, but they're going to also add, I guess, some more stealth action focused missions.
3261360	3265320	They're also going to have a Chinese base to get the fight through, and some other exclusive
3265320	3266320	download content.
3266320	3271440	But, yeah, the first download content actually should be available soon.
3271440	3274120	Operation Anchorage is what it's called.
3274120	3276040	And it's four to five hours long.
3276040	3278440	It's going to be 800 Microsoft points.
3278440	3283400	All right, well, shifting gears here a little bit, talking about a different type of quest.
3283400	3286480	I promised there'd be a story on WoW tonight, and it's not really the type of story you
3286480	3287480	might be expecting.
3287480	3291320	It's actually something Game Politics ran, so you know it's going to involve controversy.
3291320	3292320	Something political.
3292320	3294160	It has to do with World of Warcraft.
3294160	3300480	And they are actually relaying news that another website, Boing Boing, reported on this week.
3300480	3302720	It has to do with Richard Bartell.
3302720	3305560	He is apparently the guy who invented mud games.
3305560	3310640	He kind of started the mud genre on the internet, which if you don't know what that is, God,
3310640	3312000	go read on Wikipedia or something.
3312000	3315080	Basically mud games kind of really led to things like World of Warcraft.
3315080	3316640	It was the first kind of online.
3316640	3317640	It was all text-based.
3317640	3321640	Like, imagine a text-based game like Zork, make a multiplayer.
3321640	3325200	Like a lot of hardcore Dungeons and Dragons people, this is what they would do in the
3325200	3326200	early days of the net.
3326200	3327880	I played lots of them.
3327880	3328880	Right.
3328880	3329880	But here's the thing.
3329880	3331280	Richard Bartell, he got his feathers ruffled.
3331280	3332280	He was playing WoW recently.
3332280	3334820	He was playing the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, and there's apparently a quest
3334820	3335820	in the game.
3335820	3337220	And I can tell you, this quest does exist.
3337220	3341560	There's a quest where you basically torture a prisoner to get information out of him to
3341560	3342840	move on.
3342840	3344960	And this is what Richard Bartell said about it.
3344960	3347840	Basically you have to take some type of cowpoke and zap a prisoner until he talks.
3347840	3349000	I'm not at all happy with this.
3349000	3352480	I was expecting for there to be some way to tell the guy who gave you the quest that no,
3352480	3355360	actually I don't want to torture a prisoner, but there didn't seem to be any way to do
3355360	3356360	that.
3356360	3359400	Worse, the quest is part of a chain you need to complete to gain access to the Nexus, which
3359400	3363080	is the first instance you encounter if you start at the west of the continent as I did.
3363080	3367560	So either you play along and zap the guy, or you don't get to go to the Nexus.
3367560	3368700	That's actually not true.
3368700	3370440	You can go to the Nexus at any time.
3370440	3372680	If you want the quest there, you do this quest line.
3372680	3374800	I did zap him pretty well in disbelief.
3374800	3377920	I thought that surely the quest giver would step in and stop at some point.
3377920	3378920	It didn't happen, though.
3378920	3382320	Unless there's some type of awful consequence further down the line, it would seem that
3382320	3386280	Blizzard's designers are okay with breaking the Geneva Convention.
3386280	3390480	It's a game!
3390480	3394520	I'm just kind of a little bit in disbelief, because it's like, well, A, he's completely
3394520	3398720	misstating the thing about you have to do this quest to enter the Nexus.
3398720	3400240	That's not true.
3400240	3402000	You can enter the Nexus whenever.
3402000	3403280	You know, you can get some in there.
3403280	3406200	You just don't get the quest line or what have you.
3406200	3411840	But there's like 50,000 quests now, and I'm obviously overstating that.
3411840	3414080	There's lots and lots of quests in Wrath of the Lich King.
3414080	3419480	Trust me, you can level your character to 80 and only play through four of the zones.
3419480	3422080	And there's like seven or eight zones, so you could skip this all together.
3422080	3423560	You could start on the east continent or whatever.
3423560	3428140	But anyway, okay, even if you couldn't skip this and it was a part of the game, I mean,
3428140	3433160	do you write angry letters every time you watch an episode of 24 and he tortures a prisoner?
3433160	3434960	Or every time you watch a movie?
3434960	3439200	Or every time somebody wrote a torture scene in a mud game somewhere on the internet, which
3439200	3441200	I'm sure exists somewhere?
3441200	3444140	I mean, hello?
3444140	3446640	What is it we always say here that you started here, Jay?
3446640	3447640	What is it?
3447640	3449640	Learn to be offended.
3449640	3450640	Yes.
3450640	3451640	Fucking people.
3451640	3455280	I mean, it's just a game.
3455280	3460480	And you know, if you want to, you just go to the quest and you click Abandoned Quest,
3460480	3462080	and there you don't have to do it.
3462080	3464200	How hard was that?
3464200	3470000	Anyway, the kind of ignorance stated here, even if this guy is a big deal for what he
3470000	3473760	did, it was kind of a silly thing to state here.
3473760	3493640	So you know, I'm just going to do the angsty F.U. as part of the show right now.
3493640	3495960	I don't care if this is political.
3495960	3500960	A big, flaming fuck you to George Bush.
3500960	3509400	For all of the series of legislation he's just passed during his last blessed day, the
3509400	3516040	end of his stupid reign in the White House, I mean, he's basically passed a bunch of executive
3516040	3523560	orders that are going to pretty much be creating some lasting damage, not just to our economy,
3523560	3532200	but to the several ecosystems by promoting waste dumping, by allowing mining very close
3532200	3539040	to national parks, in fact, I think one of them was near Yellowstone, if I'm correct.
3539040	3547460	Also for passing a law that pretty much lets any doctor not perform any kind of procedure
3547460	3555880	based on moral, personal ethics, not necessarily the overall ethics of the community that they
3555880	3556880	represent.
3556880	3562600	And it's really disgusting, a lot of it is, as far as I can tell, unconstitutional, and
3562600	3569200	I'm sure quite a bit of it can be overturned under congressional review, which is the one
3569200	3575960	good thing that Newt Gingrich ever did, apart from being hilarious on TV.
3575960	3582560	But it's very disgusting, I encourage everyone to study up on it, and definitely write your
3582560	3588400	congressman and let them know that, you know, you're disgusted too, I'm already preparing
3588400	3589400	several letters.
3589400	3595400	I mean, because, I'm sorry, our new president has enough shit to deal with right now without
3595400	3603840	having more shit thrown on top of it, so I have faith that he can clear through the muck,
3603840	3606880	but still, it's disgusting.
3606880	3612280	In fact, I'm so infuriated by it that it makes me feel sick to my stomach, so.
3612280	3613280	Alright.
3613280	3614280	Loki.
3614280	3623880	Um, I was gonna say F U 2, take 2 for putting out a crappy version, well, I should say a
3623880	3629960	buggy version of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, the fact that I've gotta still wait for
3629960	3638480	patches before they, you know, support something that most modern games support now is ridiculous,
3638480	3644760	and I don't know, I just hate having to wait before a game to work correctly, you know,
3644760	3649520	I, if I'm spending the money to, you know, buy the game, why does it have to be, you
3649520	3653480	know, weeks later that I get a game that actually works?
3653480	3655960	Is that it?
3655960	3656960	Alright.
3656960	3662640	Um, my F U of the Week goes to potstickers, because they're really addicting, like, I
3662640	3667920	had, um, I just can't stop eating potstickers, like, it's like, the food I've been craving,
3667920	3671120	like anytime I go out to a restaurant that might have them, I have to get potstickers
3671120	3674320	because they're so friggin addicting, and I never had this, like I feel like I'm pregnant
3674320	3679040	or something and craving things I don't usually crave before, and that food is potstickers.
3679040	3681560	I know, it's so random, but that's what it is.
3681560	3682560	So F U.
3682560	3683560	You're growing a gas baby.
3683560	3684560	Apparently.
3684560	3688640	So F U to potstickers for being so non-malicious.
3688640	3691760	There you have it.
3691760	3695640	And I've learned, you can get potstickers lots of different places, it's pretty surprising,
3695640	3697640	and I've probably sampled them everywhere.
3697640	3701360	Anyway, hey, let's move back into some gaming news, let's try to get this show actually
3701360	3704640	back on the track of gaming, with our next story.
3704640	3705640	We gotta.
3705640	3706640	Yeah, of course.
3706640	3707640	Okay.
3707640	3713200	Well, um, I'm sure we have a number of, uh, our listeners who are big Dragon Quest fans,
3713200	3718480	and the, uh, next installation, Dragon Quest X, is going to be on Wii.
3718480	3722920	Um, well, basically the next one is technically 9, isn't it?
3722920	3727200	But they've confirmed that X is going to be on Wii.
3727200	3728880	And that's pretty cool.
3728880	3735240	It's also going to be, as far as I'm aware, the first of the Dragon Quest games on the
3735240	3737600	Wii, so that's pretty cool.
3737600	3743200	And, um, the Japanese release date, by the way, for Dragon Quest IX is going to be March
3743200	3745320	28th.
3745320	3749600	So it's going to be, uh, 5980 yen.
3749600	3751200	Yay.
3751200	3752640	Cool.
3752640	3759360	Um, some other cool stuff that will be, uh, well, I don't know if we're getting this around
3759360	3767000	here, but, um, Scrabble apparently has been released on the DS in, um, the UK.
3767000	3772280	And, um, I think we actually had a story about something similar a while back, um, with the
3772280	3776760	word spaz and how people kind of spazzed out about it.
3776760	3784080	Um, well, now, apparently, a used copy of the game Scrabble, which apparently learns
3784080	3792760	words based on, you know, stuff that you add in there, um, Scrabble, this, uh, kid actually
3792760	3799960	was playing it, and apparently Scrabble beat him on a triple word score with the word fuckers.
3799960	3807120	And, apparently, um, the mother of, you know, that's what I call my DS when it beats me
3807120	3808120	at a game.
3808120	3809120	Fucker!
3809120	3816520	The mother, I guess, um, apparently, uh, Tanya, um, she had bought this game for her son Ethan,
3816520	3820680	and it was a pre-owned copy, I guess, of Ubisoft Scrabble, which I didn't realize, I don't
3820680	3825920	think they have it over here, I wish they did, because Scrabble's awesome, um, but what's
3825920	3832440	funny, though, is it kept, um, you know, using different slang words, like, you know, tits
3832440	3839440	to toke to fuckers, uh, and, I guess, gave Ethan poor self-esteem or something, I don't
3839440	3840440	know.
3840440	3845240	Here's what I want to know, was the mom watching him play the DS over his shoulder?
3845240	3846240	I don't know.
3846240	3847400	How else did she find out about it?
3847400	3851880	Did he go crying to mommy, mommy, mommy, the game says fuck!
3851880	3856340	Maybe he, maybe, you know, because, you know, Scrabble saw all the words on the board, maybe
3856340	3860040	he saw the word fuckers on there, and she looked at it, and she's like, what the hell,
3860040	3861280	wait, what the hell's tits on there?
3861280	3865820	What the fuck is fuckers doing on there?
3865820	3871120	So apparently, you know, this, you know, is coming from, I guess, um, you know, what she
3871120	3875160	should have done is simply challenge the word, because I don't think you'd be able to find
3875160	3877800	it in the official Scrabble dictionary.
3877800	3883080	Well apparently, apparently, uh, this is coming from Tabloid Daily Mail, you know, they're
3883080	3884760	hosts of a bunch of useless articles.
3884760	3885760	So reliable?
3885760	3886760	Yes.
3886760	3891000	Um, Ubisoft is saying that she should have used the game's junior settings, because I
3891000	3895800	guess fuckers isn't in the junior version of Scrabble, and Nintendo, of course, doesn't
3895800	3896800	want anything to do.
3896800	3901800	That's where it'll just use, you know, Lil' Fucker.
3901800	3910720	I mean, really, this is news, really.
3910720	3911720	It's just funny.
3911720	3912720	She's really ugly, too.
3912720	3916720	She looks like she got beat with the ugly stick a bunch of times.
3916720	3921160	It's just J100Matt in chat says, uh, why do these fucking kids need to tell their parents
3921160	3923720	that their games are cursing at them?
3923720	3924720	I would laugh.
3924720	3925720	I would think that's awesome.
3925720	3927220	I would show it to my friends.
3927220	3928860	That's what you're supposed to do.
3928860	3929860	With naughty language.
3929860	3930860	Look at my boy, dude!
3930860	3940920	You know, instead of Lil' Ethan going, Mommy, Mommy, my game swore at me, I'm telling, you
3940920	3941920	know.
3941920	3943360	Lil' punk kid.
3943360	3945280	I think there's actually a version of Scrabble.
3945280	3950720	And you want to know, you know, she's totally grooming him to be a little wuss anyways,
3950720	3952760	you know, him and his pink DS.
3952760	3956720	Hey, wait a minute.
3956720	3961600	You know, here, you know, there's some type of Scrabble.
3961600	3964160	You know how like every board game has their own house rules?
3964160	3969380	Like in Monopoly, you might have a house rule where all the tax money goes into a free parking
3969380	3971960	jackpot for when you land on free parking, right?
3971960	3976600	Well, I think there's some house rules for Scrabble where dirty words automatically are
3976600	3978120	triple word score.
3978120	3980520	So like it encourages people to use bad words.
3980520	3982640	Yes, we do that all the time.
3982640	3983640	Absolutely.
3983640	3986580	We even played Ebonics Scrabble one time.
3986580	3988280	That was God.
3988280	3989720	Wow.
3989720	3991200	Wow.
3991200	3997080	If it sounded like a word, it was a word.
3997080	3998080	I'd like to play that sometime.
3998080	4002200	That would be fun.
4002200	4008600	Anyhow, one game I was mad when they discontinued many years ago and made me yell, fuckers,
4008600	4011760	was when they got rid of the great Gianna Sisters.
4011760	4016680	1987 was the year that this game was originally released, and it was pretty awesome.
4016680	4021200	It was on the Commodore 64, but the problem was it looked and felt just like Mario.
4021200	4023760	Although if you actually played it, there was like a lot of differences.
4023760	4027920	Like for instance, hello in the great Gianna Sisters, you actually fight a giant enemy
4027920	4030240	crab at the end of like the second level.
4030240	4035000	I know this predates even the PlayStation 3, but unfortunately, at least the very first
4035000	4039200	level like seriously looked exactly like Mario World 1-1.
4039200	4043000	So you know, the similarities were shown in this game ended up having to get pulled off
4043000	4044000	the market.
4044000	4048080	It was also not just big on the 64, I believe it was a big Amiga game for what I know, but
4048080	4049680	the soundtrack was amazing.
4049680	4055000	Well, anyhow, the game was, you know, taken off shelves and it kind of lived on throughout
4055000	4059680	the homebrew community and people, you know, looking for abandonware on the internet and
4059680	4060840	what have you.
4060840	4066760	Apparently, one of the creators of the game, the programmer, Armin Gessert, he is now working
4066760	4072440	on an official DS version with his new studio, Spellbound, and it's apparently going to be
4072440	4075480	coming out in June.
4075480	4080080	It's going to have over 80 levels and apparently the DS microphone is going to play into the
4080080	4083320	game somehow and they'll actually use the touch screen and everything.
4083320	4087720	Now one of the great things about the original game was the soundtrack and the new version,
4087720	4093440	Chris Hilsbeck, is coming back to do remixed versions of the original soundtrack.
4093440	4097000	So that's pretty awesome.
4097000	4101240	And this is one of those games where, you know, if you've never played this game, maybe
4101240	4104520	some week we'll highlight it as a classic game of the week down the road, but it's one
4104520	4106700	of those games you definitely should check out.
4106700	4110760	I'm sure there's clips on YouTube of the game and just, you know, you can see it's similarities
4110760	4111760	to Mario Brothers.
4111760	4116780	But it was kind of neat, it was a fun game, especially for that era, you know, it doesn't
4116780	4120440	really hold up against today's games, which is why I'm interested to see kind of what
4120440	4125640	they do to it on the DS version, how they're going to kind of make it unique.
4125640	4128000	But based on the screenshots, it looks a lot different.
4128000	4130680	It definitely doesn't look like Mario anymore, that's for sure.
4130680	4133780	So we'll see.
4133780	4135280	Let's move on.
4135280	4140440	Well, moving forward, it looks like we've actually got some release dates.
4140440	4141600	How does that sound?
4141600	4142600	Release dates!
4142600	4146280	Well, it is December, so what else can we expect?
4146280	4149000	Let me go ahead and take a look.
4149000	4150000	For the UK?
4150000	4152240	Exactly, for the UK.
4152240	4160760	Actually, it's Crash Commando and Sonic Unleashed.
4160760	4162480	That's really it.
4162480	4166480	I was going to be a little bit more excited, but I guess not.
4166480	4169440	I can't say things are much better in the US, though.
4169440	4174120	There are a few things coming out, so it's not that bad, but it's certainly not, you
4174120	4176540	know, in November or anything like that.
4176540	4181240	This week, though, some of the highlights, Rise of the Argonauts will be coming out on
4181240	4185960	all systems, well, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4185960	4194480	Also this week, we've got the release of some DS games, Kate West's The Vanishing Files.
4194480	4203080	We've also got Mystery PI, Portrait of a Thief, and Dreamer Horse Training, because god damn
4203080	4206120	it, there's not enough horse training games.
4206120	4210080	And Puppy Training, which has a really cute cover, that's awesome.
4210080	4216040	Slingo Quest, also coming out from DS, it's a mumbo jumbo casual game.
4216040	4222520	And Neopets Puzzle Adventure, ripping off Puzzle Quest there.
4222520	4228920	And let's see, lots of crappy DS games this week, man, I swear.
4228920	4235120	Australia Zoo Quest, which is a puzzle game and for some reason has Cyberwin on the cover.
4235120	4238200	Yeah, it's crikey indeed.
4238200	4243800	Learn Math for grades 1 through 4, a math learning game.
4243800	4248960	Driver's Ed Portable on DS, yes, you can learn how to drive.
4248960	4255080	And other things other than DS games, there's a few Destiny or Wii games.
4255080	4259040	Summer Sports 2, Island Sports Party, you know, they're a party game.
4259040	4264640	And We're Jeong Party, it's a mah-jeong party game, interesting.
4264640	4275280	And Rock Band 2 on the Wii, the game only version will be coming out on the 18th.
4275280	4284800	And I just gotta mention this, on the 19th, Calvin Tucker's Redneck Jamboree on the Wii.
4284800	4285800	That's it.
4285800	4289880	Well, you know, if you want a busy week for game releases, you need to look at Japan,
4289880	4291800	because there's tons of stuff coming out in Japan this week.
4291800	4295720	Now granted, a lot of it is localized versions of stuff we've already had here in the US,
4295720	4298440	but let me talk about what's coming out in Japan.
4298440	4302320	Starting with 360, we have just that, a big release for Japan would be Fable 2, the localized
4302320	4305560	version is coming out this week, December 18th.
4305560	4309080	Lego Batman, Need for Speed Undercover, and Prince of Persia, also all being released
4309080	4311480	on the 360 in Japan this week.
4311480	4315840	Also a game local for Japan, Gundam Musou 2 comes out in Japan.
4315840	4323480	And this game is a shooter that looks to be probably based on Gundam, yep, robots with
4323480	4324480	guns.
4324480	4326520	Stacey Warriors Gundam 2, there you go.
4326520	4329040	That game is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.
4329040	4332520	Moving on to the Playstation 3, many of those same titles, there's also Gundam Musou 2 comes
4332520	4334040	out there as well.
4334040	4340000	Lego Batman, Medal of Honor gets a price drop, as does the Godfather and Armored Core.
4340000	4343840	That's what you've got to look forward to on the Playstation 3, although I do want to
4343840	4348400	point out there's also a wireless keypad available now in Japan, if you want to check that out.
4348400	4353600	Hey, on the Wii, they have a game called Let's Tap is coming out from Sega in Japan.
4353600	4356120	Remember that's the one where it's the game that penguins can play.
4356120	4358920	Oh, that's right, a game that even penguins can play.
4358920	4363160	You set the Wiimote on the box and you tap the box.
4363160	4365360	You don't actually use the controller at all.
4365360	4366360	Oh, yes, yes, okay.
4366360	4369280	Kind of looks interesting, there's all these little visualizers and things.
4369280	4372280	I wonder if, they'll probably be, they're bringing that over here, right?
4372280	4374320	Could be interesting.
4374320	4379280	Bleach vs. Crusade also coming out on the Wii this week, because you know, you love
4379280	4380280	Bleach.
4380280	4381520	So there you go.
4381520	4385680	Dance Dance Revolution Furu Furu Party comes out this week in Japan as well, and that would
4385680	4388640	obviously be our version of Dancing Party.
4388640	4392960	And Elibits gets a price reduction this week, hooray.
4392960	4400360	Also going on the Playstation 2, a little game called Beatmania 2DX gets its 15th game
4400360	4402520	in the series on Playstation 2 this week.
4402520	4405460	DJ Troopers comes out on December 18th.
4405460	4409640	Not the 15th game on the Playstation, however, because they didn't start with 1st.
4409640	4411640	They started on 3rd style.
4411640	4415680	But this would be the 12th game on the Playstation 2 in the 2DX series.
4415680	4419360	In Japan only, that's not even counting the one we got in the US.
4419360	4423160	Fate Unlimited Codes is also coming out on the Playstation 2 as well as another version
4423160	4431960	of Gondamuso 2 for the Playstation 2, and Pachinko series volume 13, Neon Genesis Evangelion.
4431960	4432960	Yet another one.
4432960	4433960	Lord.
4433960	4435800	Why can't they let that series die?
4435800	4437360	They just can't.
4437360	4441440	On the DS, lots and lots and lots of games getting released on the DS over there as well
4441440	4446040	as some other, let me just kind of give you some of the names of things coming out.
4446040	4450960	Tales of Hearts is one that's coming out, as well as Space Puzzle Bobble.
4450960	4453320	Ragnarok Online DS comes out this week.
4453320	4457160	Jamie Alistin, Ragnarok Online on the DS, finally, this week in Japan, there you have
4457160	4458160	it.
4458160	4460320	And Jamie, you might be interested in this one too.
4460320	4465480	Princess Ballerina, Yumei Miru 4 Gen no Primadonna.
4465480	4467920	Don't you like primadonnas?
4467920	4472320	No, but I'm watching Bush get a shoe thrown at him and that's pretty fucking funny.
4472320	4473320	Stop it.
4473320	4476880	Lego Batman also comes out.
4476880	4482160	Rensu Suikoden Tear Crease comes out, that would be the Suikoden's strategic title.
4482160	4487600	So it's a busy week in DS World and as far as the PSP goes, all the other systems are
4487600	4489440	getting love, why not the PSP?
4489440	4493440	And yes, Final Fantasy Dissida finally makes its way out of the PSP this week, I'm sure
4493440	4495760	you'll be hearing a lot about that.
4495760	4502360	Also I do want to point this out, Crimson Room Rebirth also comes out and some movies
4502360	4509720	for the localized for Japan, Biohazard Degeneration, what would that be?
4509720	4513960	And then Star Wars The Clone Wars also comes out this week in Japan.
4513960	4518440	Need for Speed Undercover, Samurai Showdown Anthology, Ultimate Board Game Collection,
4518440	4522520	all on the PSP, very busy week in Japan for releases.
4522520	4524320	So there you go.
4524320	4530280	Let's move on with more news and then we're going to take a quick break here.
4530280	4538600	While there is a little bit more, this actually has to do with some, excuse me, with something
4538600	4540520	having to do with Rockstar.
4540520	4544880	There's going to be, well actually I think it already happened, there was a social club
4544880	4551500	event put out by Rockstar for Midnight Club Los Angeles and Grand Theft Auto IV that was
4551500	4555600	going on Xbox Live and Playstation Network.
4555600	4565280	They were supposed to have a little contest, as in a video editor contest for GTA IV PC
4565280	4570680	and then for topping the Midnight Club Ocean to LA time trial.
4570680	4573800	And there were supposed to be prizes available for both.
4573800	4583520	It was though already going on and I do believe it was from five to nine UK time actually
4583520	4586880	I think today, so already going.
4586880	4589960	Good luck to whoever won.
4589960	4595080	That's pretty cool.
4595080	4600860	Some other fun stuff, Prototype.
4600860	4606080	You may remember this game being kind of like an open world, crack down meets, you know,
4606080	4609680	kind of mutants type of thing.
4609680	4615960	What's interesting though is, earlier this week, a bunch of different blogs and stuff
4615960	4620680	were reporting that Activision's Prototype website is actually broken and some of the
4620680	4627480	assets from apparently CES were leaking out onto the web.
4627480	4632720	And there was all sorts of different gameplay videos and stuff like that, you know, that
4632720	4637440	was supposed to be stuff that they were showing off at CES and then, you know, a few, I guess
4637440	4646640	a day later or so, the hole was covered back up and the countdown back to CES was put back
4646640	4648880	on the website.
4648880	4655360	Well, the funny thing is about all that, that's what they want you to think, you see.
4655360	4660760	The whole leak was a hoax, actually.
4660760	4661760	Perpetrated...
4661760	4663120	Do people know that?
4663120	4664120	No.
4664120	4665120	Perpetrated by...
4665120	4668800	So wait, you're saying the game blogs all got punk this week?
4668800	4671480	Yes, they all got punk this week.
4671480	4674480	Perpetrated by their marketing team.
4674480	4675480	And how do you know this?
4675480	4676480	You're making this up.
4676480	4677480	You make this shit up.
4677480	4679400	No, I don't make this shit up.
4679400	4683300	I know this because they sent out an email boasting about it.
4683300	4685840	So it's all a ruse...
4685840	4686840	To who?
4686840	4687840	To you?
4687840	4689600	Why would Activision send you an email boasting about it?
4689600	4696760	They send it to all of their retail partners to let their customers know because they're
4696760	4702920	trying to drive up buzz for prototyping because everybody loves leaked assets and so they're
4702920	4704220	going to start talking about it.
4704220	4709100	If it was just a release of assets, it might not have been getting as much attention.
4709100	4713060	But since it was something forbidden, people are interested in it.
4713060	4714060	And it worked.
4714060	4720440	It got them all to cover this leak and got all the information out there and the videos
4720440	4725720	were ranked pretty high in game trailers and that's all good buzz for them.
4725720	4727520	People want to see things they're not supposed to be seeing.
4727520	4728520	Exactly.
4728520	4729520	But it was a hoax the whole time.
4729520	4731960	The whole time it was a hoax.
4731960	4739280	They made it look like it was an FTP directory and everything and they got you all.
4739280	4741140	And people don't know this yet.
4741140	4742800	You're the one telling them.
4742800	4743800	People don't know it.
4743800	4747180	It doesn't really matter because the game looks awesome.
4747180	4752640	The whole thing is they're tricking the people that they normally work with in the media
4752640	4755400	to cover their game.
4755400	4757840	Surely these people are going to find out eventually if they haven't already.
4757840	4759840	Do you think there's going to be retaliation?
4759840	4760840	No.
4760840	4762480	I think this stuff happens all the time to be honest.
4762480	4763480	Okay.
4763480	4764480	Here's another thing though.
4764480	4769600	Could they be saying now that, oh yeah, we meant for that to happen when maybe they didn't?
4769600	4770600	No.
4770600	4771600	It was in great detail.
4771600	4780240	In fact, you know who tipped them off that the site had been broken?
4780240	4782080	The people that orchestrated the whole thing.
4782080	4785960	They're the ones that tipped off the media.
4785960	4789280	Interesting.
4789280	4796720	But just goes to show you, sometimes you may see these leaks via, I don't know, survey
4796720	4802960	sites and stuff like that, and you may think, hey, why aren't these publishers doing anything
4802960	4805320	to stop these leaks?
4805320	4811580	Sometimes they're intentional, and sometimes that's how they drive buzz for stuff.
4811580	4816760	Just a little bit of insight in the back workings of the game publishing world.
4816760	4820540	I'm kind of not surprised by what you're telling me, but there is that very skeptical part
4820540	4824940	of me that's like, oh well sure, they didn't know about it when it happened, but now it's
4824940	4825940	...
4825940	4827720	It was in great detail.
4827720	4833880	I wish I had forwarded the email to myself so I could read it.
4833880	4835380	It's funny.
4835380	4837120	It's not that important.
4837120	4842320	It's just funny.
4842320	4845040	But the game itself looks pretty cool, I guess.
4845040	4847280	Yeah, the game looks awesome.
4847280	4848800	It's going to be a really fun game.
4848800	4852000	It's definitely going to be something I pick up because it's like crack down.
4852000	4853480	Come on.
4853480	4857000	I'm feeling something I'll be playing.
4857000	4858000	All right.
4858000	4861920	Well, moving on, before we take a break here on the show, that was a pretty big bombshell.
4861920	4863720	We should probably have said that earlier in the show.
4863720	4864720	Yeah, whatever.
4864720	4865720	It's not that big of a deal.
4865720	4870240	A little reward to those who actually pay attention to the whole thing, I guess.
4870240	4875240	Also a reward for being persistent and working at things.
4875240	4879400	Not really gaming news, but kind of a gaming funny, I guess you could say.
4879400	4884840	At Missouri State, there was a guy who used his wireless controller to find his stolen
4884840	4885840	360.
4885840	4886840	Here's the weird thing.
4886840	4888040	His Xbox 360 got stolen.
4888040	4889520	He lived in a college dorm.
4889520	4892960	He noticed that he could still power on his controller because they didn't take the controllers
4892960	4893960	because they were wireless.
4893960	4898480	He could still power on his controller, and the controller was connecting to the 360.
4898480	4902320	So knowing that, he realized it's in the next room.
4902320	4905140	No, well, not necessarily, but he knew it was 30 feet away.
4905140	4909440	So through the process of elimination, what he did, he actually went to the fourth, fifth,
4909440	4912960	and sixth floors and found that the controller still worked on the fourth floor, fifth floor,
4912960	4916380	and sixth floor, but it would not work on the third or seventh floor.
4916380	4918680	So process of elimination, where was the Xbox?
4918680	4920480	On the fifth floor, in the middle one, right?
4920480	4923960	So then he went to the fifth floor.
4923960	4926920	If you get too far from the Xbox, the thing will start blinking.
4926920	4930480	So using the process of elimination, he found out where the center was.
4930480	4931480	In hot and cold?
4931480	4932480	Basically, yeah.
4932480	4935740	hot and cold with his controller and it told him exactly where the stolen Xbox
4935740	4940940	was and they actually got the RA, the resident assistant, to go into the room
4940940	4945680	and where the stolen Xbox supposedly was they found the Xbox and apparently what's
4945680	4951840	really funny about it is that the thief wasn't around when they got it so
4951840	4959560	they know who lives there yeah interesting interesting people actually
4959560	4963360	do have a brain in college people are retarded the old some people are brain
4963360	4967480	in college some people who stole it obviously doesn't have a brain they'll
4967480	4972560	be going home seriously I don't know I'd be pressing charges but that would be me
4972560	4981080	because you know I totally don't care so kinda um that's a stupid award in a way
4981080	4985200	I probably stole it well but the thing is I I more give props to the guy who
4985200	4988400	used the investigative skills to figure it out you know what I mean that's like
4988400	4993640	the guy who stole it is I versus spy yes I guess you'd say it's kind of both at
4993640	4997960	once a good job is it it's kind of like you're that what it would it go good job
4997960	5001480	gumshoe remember Carmen San Diego yeah so he's the gumshoe of the week award
5001480	5005560	did I almost actually bought that game on PC what we're in the world's Carmen
5005560	5009440	San Diego yeah it was awesome I found it thrift store is that one of those games
5009440	5012360	you can do a game tap I'm pretty sure it is I don't have game to build school
5012360	5021560	once I have ZSNES and magic engine and actually have the systems to look we're
5021560	5025640	gonna get into the classic game of the week is a part of the show we like to do
5025640	5029760	here every week where dark soccer will take a game from years past and
5029760	5035320	highlighted here on the show because you should respect your elders in games and
5035320	5044520	you're just so excited you just throw in your microphone oh yes the classic
5044520	5049320	video game of the week of the classic game of the week is willow for the
5049320	5052960	Nintendo Entertainment System you know what's hilarious I was just thinking
5052960	5056920	about this game today I shit you not and I was actually thinking like this game
5056920	5060040	needs to be highlighted as a classic game of the week and I swear to God
5060040	5063520	before I read that you were picking up for tonight amazing
5063520	5067200	well you have to skip about a minute 25 minute music because it has the music I
5067200	5073320	like which is the actual kicking-ass outside the village music
5083960	5088360	it's like some of the best video game music ever you know what other game is
5088360	5094280	awesome that's also based off a movie Adams family that's just quest was shit
5094280	5102520	it's pretty cool so well I own back to willow the game came out in 1989 it
5102520	5108400	actually came out for the Famicom first in 1988 sorry it actually came out 1989
5108400	5112840	on both systems but the movie came out in 88 so basically you play as willow
5112840	5122840	and you go by yourself and it's kind of Zelda ish but not really it's more like
5122840	5128600	um kind of playing like Secret of Mana did actually but being a Nintendo an NES
5128600	5133480	game but it was put out by Capcom this is one of the cool things that Capcom
5133480	5139160	has given us why don't we have willow in a Capcom game huh there are also other
5139160	5143960	I'm thinking licensing for the movie I'm joking right there are also other games
5143960	5150400	there was a computer game that came out on amiga Atari st and a DOS game that
5150400	5157160	came out by a midnight entertainment group but it wasn't the same game it was
5157160	5160600	a different one so anyone who's thinking they've got it you're wrong I was gonna
5160600	5164120	say I'm surprised I'd never played that that's cool though there's also an
5164120	5170680	arcade version but it was action adventure and again is not like this one
5170680	5176480	this one is a is a action RPG is pretty cool little game and you could get you
5176480	5180740	know basically your items and weapons and meet people from the game and go talk
5180740	5185840	to stuff as RPG but it was willow and it was pretty cool plus you know it had
5185840	5194880	acorns that turn people into stone I love this game
5194880	5198440	all right there it is your classic game of the week willow on the Nintendo
5198440	5202480	Entertainment System and there's a complete walkthrough there on YouTube
5202480	5205440	that we were kind of playing the music from there you can just watch somebody
5205440	5208200	blast through the game they use cheat codes to do it but you still get a
5208200	5211520	pretty good feel for what the game looks like there so I love that game I played
5211520	5215680	the crap I did too that was one of those games I rented and that we held on to it
5215680	5217960	for like so long because I didn't want to take it back
5217960	5222560	you ended up having to pay for it yeah well not not you know just a pretty you
5222560	5228120	know like probably like $12 which is the time was a lot for a rental so there you
5228120	5231240	go but willow was awesome all right we're gonna take a break here on orange

5260800	5263840	full experience of the show and being able to interact with the chat room and
5263840	5266640	then you don't have to wait forever for the show to come out because I get
5266640	5270360	distracted so easily and dah dah dah dah dah live is awesome but you know we do
5270360	5273520	love you guys listen on the podcast as well we got plenty more news for you
5273520	5276960	guys this segment and we'll start off with Loki who just finished watching the
5276960	5280720	Spike TV Awards through the matches of the internet right just last even though
5280720	5284200	we don't really give a crap about the VGA's well do we find that do we ever
5284200	5288960	find out if people actually vote on this or if it's just you know experts it may
5288960	5294840	be experts but game of the year went to Grand Theft Auto 4 which yeah I mean
5294840	5298440	there's so many games that come out hard to like rate one I play Grand Theft Auto
5298440	5303160	4 a lot so yeah sure it's I guess my game of the year but um you know the
5303160	5306960	best part about that is I guess we'll see a version of Grand Theft Auto 4
5306960	5310000	come out you know because they always do the game of the year editions so
5310000	5313560	there'll be one with the lost in the dam download content probably for the 360
5313560	5320680	sometime maybe in the fall I don't know spring summer but you know they always
5320680	5324120	did the game of the year edition the chat says it's experts that vote on it
5324120	5329160	not the experts yet people that work for blogs and stuff actually I think there
5329160	5332280	were people like I know there's someone from joystick that was on the voting
5332280	5341400	community and stuff like that so experts yeah ok sorry let's get into some real
5341400	5346400	news now lucky alright well apparently a woman from Colorado think she has an
5346400	5353600	expert opinion of Nintendo's neglect to provide adequate supports for
5353600	5362000	we remotes yes there is another class-action lawsuit frivolous for well
5362000	5370280	she doesn't think so for Nintendo's lack of adequate straps for their we remotes
5370280	5377240	she claims that even though the new straps are thicker and they are the
5377240	5381600	third purse our third version with a new plastic strap they still fail to secure
5381600	5389080	the we remote to the user during strenuous use furthermore the suit
5389080	5394140	alleges that Nintendo has failed to report a single remote strap issue to
5394140	5398460	the Consumer Product Safety Commission in their monthly reports despite
5398460	5404440	Nintendo support documents prove the existence of said issues you know what
5404440	5407760	lady then you don't get to play the Wii you have your right taken away if you
5407760	5412360	can't control you know a simple little thing in your head you don't get to play
5412360	5418080	it I'm sorry but yeah I do agree with our sacred is extremely frivolous I mean
5418080	5423640	for one the straps are basically there so that you don't drop the remote on the
5423640	5429080	ground furthermore then they went to you reinforce them because idiots don't
5429080	5433460	realize that they are just meant to prevent you from dropping them on the
5433460	5437760	ground and so they even reinforce them enough to where you know if you let go
5437760	5443580	accidentally it probably won't break but it's no guarantee I mean it's just do
5443580	5448160	they need to put a sticker on the remote that says please touch me gently they
5448160	5453800	have a warning in front of me with every single game ok they have a warning that
5453800	5458760	says do not let go of the remote make sure the rip the wrist strap is secure
5458760	5464760	they even have a stupid condoms on there you make sure that you know people if
5464760	5468640	they do throw me it's gonna you know it's a rubbery support how much more do
5468640	5474880	you want them to reinforce these things so that it is still good throw it you
5474880	5478880	know I mean seriously and you know that's simply just a case of consumer
5478880	5486400	stupidity someone needs to just duct tape her into someone seller will a
5486400	5490680	judge throw this out yes or no judge order to be locked up in a cellar by
5490680	5497240	duct tape duct tape is great for everything you know duct tape will
5497240	5501040	silence the stupid masses alright you know what else is great is Circuit City
5501040	5504040	you know I'm not talking about the actual store for the prices but the fact
5504040	5508040	that they spoil things which is pretty awesome on the Circuit City apparently
5508040	5511800	has a spilled some beans about some upcoming releases including Fire Emblem
5511800	5516240	Shadow Dragon it's coming out in North America on February 23rd this is if I
5516240	5519720	guess the Circuit City computer system is to believe I'm not sure exactly where
5519720	5525400	this is coming from their website or something but yeah pretty cool huh yeah
5525400	5531000	it's pretty cool also should point this out even bigger for UDS people Pokemon
5531000	5537240	Platinum you still in the collective all Pokemon Platinum March 22nd and Circuit
5537240	5542440	City had it listed but then they pulled it if that doesn't confirm it I don't
5542440	5549520	know what does shadow or Fire Emblem that date is close if not accurate
5549520	5555120	interesting but not that you know anything I know anything that you would
5555120	5559840	ever repeated on the show now there have been a few things that move though so
5559840	5566120	like some of those play for Wii games and stuff coming out later but I have a
5566120	5570560	feeling though the reason why a lot of these have been pushed and stuff is
5570560	5574240	they're gonna make a big announcement maybe at CES or something that you're
5574240	5577920	gonna announce some more games and stuff maybe a little bit on the we see us is
5577920	5580800	not a gaming show I don't know why people think these huge announcements
5580800	5583960	are gonna come out at CES well they're gonna announce them at some point I mean
5583960	5587800	it's only a few months off so I would think CES being the next show this
5587800	5592520	sort of can do their own thing they can say we got Reggie coming to a party me
5592520	5596160	and moto in the house and the press will show up but here's the thing though Rob
5596160	5602480	is I think that they would do something at CES because the DSI then you know the
5602480	5609120	DSI coming out next year at some point I mean that's a technology thing and fair
5609120	5615320	enough because they may all into that I don't know that's just a guess all right
5615320	5619200	I suppose that's an educated guess I would say it's like a seventh grade
5619200	5623160	level educated guess no I'm kidding but all right we'll see what happens you
5623160	5626640	might be right I've always kind of wanted to go to consumer electronic show
5626640	5630680	just for the laughs and giggles but I won't be able to go this year that's for
5630680	5633640	sure I do know that there are going to be gaming people there I mean there's
5633640	5640400	like I got a you know obviously I'm not going to see yes but I got an invite you
5640400	5644880	know for anybody that you know game retailers are our customers or whatever
5644880	5648800	if they were going to see yes that they can go sit through a Microsoft
5648800	5652040	presentation they're gonna show them the upcoming stuff that they've got coming
5652040	5657720	out for next year like you know probably just halo wars at that point but you
5657720	5664400	know stuff like that so there will be some presence it's getting bigger yes
5664400	5667800	well it's not that far off so we will see soon if they're gonna announce these
5667800	5674120	officially or not yeah let's move on well something that is actually an
5674120	5679360	official is that there's going to be former members of Team Ninja and those
5679360	5684040	who worked on brawl doing a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighter I'm going
5684040	5692400	to be on the Wii and it's supposed to be a 2.5 D fighter and it's supposed to be
5692400	5698880	out late 2009 and it's a to quote it's supposed to feature online play to
5698880	5705360	outperform brawl so I'm hoping that they can pull it off I mean that would be
5705360	5713160	really cool I actually did like the old to the TMNT tournament fighters that was
5713160	5717480	kind of a fun game so hopefully this will have actually I hope it has some of
5717480	5725360	the the characters from that series I think would be fun definitely I mean the
5725360	5729120	fact that they're saying that they're going to try to outdo Smash Brothers is
5729120	5734440	kind of a pretty big boasting argument there but I don't know we'll see that's
5734440	5740960	really high bar I guess to me something else is going to say is coming from
5740960	5745400	check is too good Leo Shannon chat says Team Ninja equals April with breast
5745400	5749200	physics there you go very nice
5749200	5758320	let's see Halo Wars has been announced to be coming out now on March 3rd and
5758320	5762760	kind of interesting there's a lot of stuff coming out right there in March
5762760	5768280	especially since I think a week before that you have killed zone 2 on the ps3
5768280	5777240	now of course Halo Wars is the RTS kind of prequel to the whole Halo series and
5777240	5783200	they've got lots of interesting stuff in there including I think you will play
5783200	5788840	as the flood the Covenant and also course you know the Spartans and stuff
5788840	5794360	like that so that's pretty cool and I guess the game will be also coming out
5794360	5803500	on February 26 in Japan so that's actually one that Japan's getting it a
5803500	5811220	few days before us kind of interesting and apparently coming out in Africa
5811220	5819720	Europe in the Middle East the day after so almost a worldwide release there be
5819720	5823680	interesting to see how that is cuz I know it's probably not gonna do as well
5823680	5827440	like a normal Halo game cuz it's a me I'm not a first-person shooter but it
5827440	5831320	has a low name on it it does have a new name on it and there are a lot RTS fans
5831320	5837920	out there so you know they're hoping to kind of be like a Starcraft but it's
5837920	5843960	tough well here's something I'm hoping for and you know take this all the grain
5843960	5847680	of salt because these are news items quote-unquote news coming from the
5847680	5850000	latest issue of electronic gaming monthly which I don't know if you heard
5850000	5853000	but they might not be around much more which kind of sad when you consider that
5853000	5857440	magazine's been around a long long time but magazine take this all the grain of
5857440	5861360	salt apparently I think it's probably all coming from quarter man or what have
5861360	5866560	you yeah here's the thing apparently a sequel to rez is coming out from Tetsuya
5866560	5870920	Mizuguchi now here's the thing it's not a real sequel to rez because apparently
5870920	5877480	Sega owns the IP but he's gonna be making a you know rez-like game now
5877480	5880840	they're quick to point out that it could be related to this QJ game that's
5880840	5883680	supposed to come out for the Wii but it could be two different things going on
5883680	5887040	altogether which in my mind it probably is because I think QJ was previously
5887040	5890120	said it was gonna be a puzzler rez is definitely not a puzzler rez is an
5890120	5895120	awesome fucking rail shooter game so but it's nice to know especially because of
5895120	5898880	that I guess it did pretty well on Xbox Live it's nice to hear there's interest
5898880	5902960	there again I just hope whatever this is doesn't come out on Wii that it is
5902960	5905800	another HD game that makes sense
5905800	5911960	yeah also kind of some other things going on apparently whatever mystery
5911960	5916600	project LMNO that was going on at EA apparently that is now on ice right now
5916600	5919360	I should say like gone forever but just on hold because of all the layoffs that
5919360	5923440	were going on is the other Spielberg game yeah yes yes there was he worked on
5923440	5926960	boom blocks so this is the other one he was doing apparently it is now on hold
5926960	5932880	and maybe it could that be related to the questionable sales of boom blocks a
5932880	5937720	new rifts game in 2010 as well in Gears of War 3 also in 2010 which really isn't
5937720	5939520	a big surprise at all
5939520	5942480	there's gonna be another Gears of War game they'll probably be Gears of War 4 at some
5942480	5947040	point too just like they'll be a Halo 4 someday well I mean heck what do you
5947040	5950760	call this halo 3 dark or no that has a new name now that the other random
5950760	5957680	numbers and letters whatever that is just halo 4 right there you have it some
5957680	5963880	rumors out of electronic gaming monthly take with grain of salt we have a little
5963880	5972440	bit more rumor more like a hint is that there could quite possibly be halo 2
5972440	5982440	halo 2 available as a full digital download so that's pretty interesting is
5982440	5991920	basically when asked if if there would be the the quote is I can't say anything
5991920	5997280	else on it I would be killed to death so I think it's pretty interesting
5997280	6004280	yeah it's interesting because that would be the first like at least on the place
6004280	6008600	on the Xbox 360 sorry the ps3 already did this with them the burnout game but
6008600	6015200	on the 360 where you would have like a full you know $50 game $60 game which
6015200	6018340	maybe would come down in price by the time they digitally distribute but you
6018340	6022400	know a full price game for download you're starting to see this slowly
6022400	6026760	happen with other games to like a wrath of the Lich King is available now as a
6026760	6030940	digital download burnout obviously you start to see this more and more and you
6030940	6036440	know game spot swears they're not worried I'm sorry game stop where's
6036440	6040160	they're not worried now I wouldn't be there because it's the same with movies
6040160	6044760	I mean movies there's more of that now we can actually purchase stuff and rent
6044760	6051840	stuff online digital download but it's definitely not taken away too much from
6051840	6058240	you know buying you know games I mean look at if anything you look at the
6058240	6062200	special editions and special edition sales I mean people love their special
6062200	6065320	editions and they keep getting more creative and putting more crap in there
6065320	6069360	well in the case of fable 2 maybe not so much should be start taking stuff out
6069360	6073280	but for everything else though I mean they're still getting people to buy
6073280	6078200	these special editions for you know a lot of money I mean look at the
6078200	6082600	legendary edition stuff of halo 3 and stuff which by the way I saw it fries
6082600	6086520	this weekend for 59 I know you have a lot of those and yeah they weren't
6086520	6097800	selling as hot as people thought yeah but yeah I mean it's definitely gonna
6097800	6100880	head that way at some point where they'll allow you to download stuff but
6100880	6106800	I think also people have to keep in mind is it really worth it downloading a game
6106800	6111560	like that especially with like a 360 you know where your system might conk out on
6111560	6114800	you then you gotta get a new one then you have to find some way to be able to
6114800	6119960	you know how to tie to your new system and also when you're done with it you
6119960	6125400	can't sell it off used which is another thing but you know that for some people
6125400	6129960	that might not be a big deal and you only have so much room I mean what your
6129960	6133760	hard drive fills up it fills up exactly that's kind of a bummer I mean sure they
6133760	6138080	can release a new hard drive but those hard drives ain't cheap I paid a hundred fifty bucks for my 120 gigabyte hard drive
6138080	6141840	yeah sadly enough those hard drives the actual parts don't cost that much and
6141840	6146600	that's the bad thing about it is I mean they're just laptop hard drives through
6146600	6150440	like a special connector it's just yeah don't remind me because I'm gonna get
6150440	6158400	more mad you keep talking Loki but hey hey but you remember though that is one
6158400	6161920	that is one plus though about the ps3 those they do let you upgrade your hard
6161920	6166240	drive and you don't have to buy a special hard drive from them it's just any hard
6166240	6170040	drive will do which I think is the way that Microsoft should have gone with
6170040	6176520	their hard drives if you ask me but what do I know? One thing I will say this you know
6176520	6179600	despite the hard time I gave the PlayStation 3 you know for many many
6179600	6182960	years on this program I will say this I will admit this playing Prince of Persia
6182960	6187680	this week it's been nice and quiet while I've been playing the game I'll give it that
6187680	6193520	yeah so other things coming Fable II's way of course a brand new expansion
6193520	6198800	Not Whole Island is going to be available to download on December 22nd it
6198800	6203680	will run you 800 Microsoft points or that's ten dollars in real money and
6203680	6208560	some interesting things along with that of course it's going to add some new
6208560	6216120	costumes a bunch of new missions and some other fun stuff including some more
6216120	6221600	achievements as well there are three achievements tied with this now there's
6221600	6226480	the collector which is worth 25 gamer score if you acquire all the mystery
6226480	6232720	items in the box of secret shop or see another hero doing so the meteorologist
6232720	6237320	which is worth 50 gamer points that will bring up you have to bring all of Not
6237320	6241720	Whole Island's weather problems under control or help another hero do it and
6241720	6247240	the bibliophile which is 25 gamer points find all the books detailing the history
6247240	6254840	of Not Whole Island or help another hero doing so so interesting I may pick this
6254840	6259600	up I'm not sure yet because I haven't really gotten to Fable II that much
6259600	6264720	still want to go back to Lost Odyssey I haven't finished that your wife sure did
6264720	6268280	get to Fable II though yeah she burned through the whole game really quick by
6268280	6270720	the way your wife is pissed apparently she brought the wheat of the studio
6270720	6274000	tonight yes I brought the wheat of the studio and she's been playing Animal
6274000	6277120	Crossing quite a bit she got mad at me because I played it for four hours
6277120	6280760	yesterday she's not gonna be able to pay off her debt to Tom Nook well she doesn't
6280760	6284200	care about that she we're time traveling right now so we're in we're actually
6284200	6290300	playing in July because we got bored with winter so yeah so now we're
6290300	6297600	collecting bugs but yeah she's very mad she fact said I have to be home by 10 so
6297600	6302320	that she can play Animal Crossing did we do we tell everybody not make it Loki
6302320	6306320	might not be able to do the review yeah we're doing that preview tonight of
6306320	6310560	maybe we might not make it no it doesn't matter yeah I'll be there by 10 or
6310560	6316680	whatever yeah Tatsunoko vs. Capcom oh yeah very cool might be a short one
6316680	6320760	tonight yes see um in fact you probably should get all that shit hooked since we
6320760	6323080	don't have the adjusted TV cam tonight you might want to get all that hooked up
6323080	6326240	before we I will wait one minute we go off air we can just go into that and be
6326240	6331360	done hey left 4 dead is another one of those games I really need to check out
6331360	6333760	at some point because I usually don't like to like first-person shooters that
6333760	6336640	much but it's valve and it's zombies it might be pretty cool and I've heard
6336640	6339640	nothing but really good things about this game except for the fact that
6339640	6342800	people have been cheating on the game but guess what valve did this week they
6342800	6347040	put the hammer down on that they fixed some exploits on the Xbox 360 version
6347040	6349480	but here's the interesting thing about it apparently there were some cheats
6349480	6355000	around where players were spawning all sorts of items enemies I guess some some
6355000	6358720	type of exploit in the game valve was able to patch that server side so that
6358720	6360840	way they didn't even have to push out a patch and wait for that to be approved
6360840	6364600	from Microsoft so they fixed it on their end they put out a statement it is done
6364600	6369480	but what you can still do it on your local games right you still do the thing
6369480	6373400	because it only fixes this when you're playing the live games online basically
6373400	6377840	what they did is they use that there's a mod tool that you can you have a device
6377840	6382440	to basically rip files off your hard drive which they actually do sell them
6382440	6385560	they're like 50 bucks think about picking one up because I need to buy
6385560	6391920	useless crap you can mod a file on there and it will allow you to do different
6391920	6396840	cheats in the game which might be fun because I like the cheating games and so
6396840	6402640	yeah let's go cheating for local games at least let's go cheating that would be
6402640	6409320	a fun game cheaters presents let's go cheating
6409320	6414480	I didn't mean like cheating on on did you relationship said you here and I've
6414480	6416960	seen this in our no no it's coming
6416960	6421840	Grey's Anatomy the game for we in the DS what the shit what are you gonna make a
6421840	6425500	game out of for Grey's Anatomy I want to know they're they're doing it they
6425500	6430680	actually have the ESRB little descriptor on there you know how they are starting
6430680	6436160	to put descriptions other than just reading on and it's it's interesting
6436160	6444040	they're ready for emo soundtrack no it's definitely not ready but yeah there's
6444040	6450400	like you know I don't know if it's like trauma center with sex or something but
6450400	6456440	you know I don't know like let me hear you have to stop time on the center part
6456440	6459880	dating sim no let me let me read this real quick this is funny it's all from
6459880	6463640	the ESRB description for Grey's Anatomy it's a story based role-playing game
6463640	6467520	this is a storyline contains frequent references to sexual encounters between
6467520	6474400	different characters and dialogue that contains sexual innuendo for example is
6474400	6478240	there anyone in this hospital you're not gonna sleep with and you want to have
6478240	6481800	sex after surgery I don't know about you but that's not a sexual innuendo that's
6481800	6486380	you want to have sex after surgery some scenes take place soon after the
6486380	6492520	characters have had sex dialogue also contains mine minor expletives for
6492520	6498600	example hell and ass and references to alcohol like you me at a row no hell and
6498600	6505920	ass alcohol this game looks like crap but they'll be funny though Grey's
6505920	6510640	Anatomy Grey's Anatomy the game amazing hey I gotta read some comments from the
6510640	6515120	chat about you and you and Nelly and the way you play Animal Crossing cuz they
6515120	6519040	had some comments here act-def says Animal Crossing the game about time
6519040	6525520	traveling and its effects let's see press start says Tom Nook is gonna break
6525520	6529400	her legs Tiger Claw says you better do what your wife says Loki you don't want
6529400	6533760	to have a divorce over the Wii and SSJ 100 Matt wonders aloud why does Nelly
6533760	6539040	have to cock block us and SSJ 100 Matt also makes this very winner comment
6539040	6552160	about the way you play Animal Crossing
6552160	6556360	cuz they don't have to go new change the actual date on your system you can
6556360	6562720	actually change the date in the game which is nice also I was trying I was
6562720	6569880	going to ask if you got a blue phone box in your town no we don't have a blue
6569880	6575480	phone box it has TARDIS dark to see us as Rocky or picture shows on Xbox Live
6575480	6580840	Netflix anything to look for that did you know that I'm not sure I didn't know
6580840	6585080	this until today but you can actually change out what bed you have in your
6585080	6592200	attic can you yes with any bed and by Tony dude I'm totally putting the regal
6592200	6598040	bed in my attic I wish I could decorate my damn attic I'm tired of my attic
6598040	6603880	looking like wood to the bottom of your bed and it will allow you to change it
6603880	6609360	there should just be like misty says she's a screw that I wanted I want to
6609360	6614000	TARDIS I want to have my house be a TARDIS I'm kind of surprised they're not
6614000	6617160	trying to nickel-and-dime us yet in Animal Crossing with releasing the you
6617160	6621120	know stuff you have to pay for that you can get I bet Nelly do that they're not
6621120	6627280	that smart though that's the problem though with you know because here's the
6627280	6631160	thing is if they have that kind of content would be paid unlock content and
6631160	6634080	if they have that in the game someone would figure out how to hack it and
6634080	6639600	unlock it already because we'll do that or like maybe okay the old school
6639600	6642960	Nintendo games like maybe just have the ones that I have on my virtual console
6642960	6647920	I don't know I guess I like this kind of dumb forget it never forget I said
6647920	6652920	anything all right let's let's get that statement of the show that we encourage
6652920	6656040	you to participate with our show every week by sending us emails mailbag at
6656040	6659680	orange lounge radio.com and the dark soccer is gonna open up the mailbag I am
6659680	6664040	a few of her yes you are you better once you're gonna read a few of her favorite
6664040	6670280	emails right now I will subject her to watching really bad movies on Netflix I
6670280	6674200	watched manos the hands of fate here's the thing I watched a documentary today
6674200	6678120	because I love Netflix for obscure fucking documentaries I watched one on
6678120	6682520	the 50 worst movies ever made man that's the hands of fate number one it didn't
6682520	6686160	even make the top 50 it didn't I will say this though this is awesome and
6686160	6692080	even in Time magazine instantly made me think of Loki number 11 I think it was
6692080	6696120	was some karate movie I don't remember the name of it I'll have to find it but
6696120	6703480	the trick was the one dude had no arms and the other dude had no legs awesome
6703480	6709000	and they were actually karate fighting in the movie it was amazing I have to
6709000	6712320	figure out what I have to figure out what freakin movie it was maybe
6712320	6717440	something in channel no but it was did they tie themselves together I don't
6717440	6721000	know themselves together made like a one person they like that character in
6721000	6725860	thrill-kill kind of sort of they were actually fighting with henchmen and it
6725860	6729040	was it was amazing I mean these are so bad fucking movies
6729040	6733400	is again the worst 150 worst movies ever made it was number one number
6733400	6738040	Number one had some long ass titles from the 60s, something like, it was like a musical
6738040	6739040	about zombies.
6739040	6740040	Who put out the, um...
6740040	6741160	I have to see this.
6741160	6742500	I don't know who put it out.
6742500	6746520	I have to say this, the documentary itself wasn't that good, but the, and I love it.
6746520	6748520	I want to see the movie, screw the documentary.
6748520	6750960	Yeah, I know, I just want to see the movie.
6750960	6753960	Why is not Manos The Hands of Fate on there?
6753960	6754960	I don't know.
6754960	6756520	Is that because they MST3K'd it?
6756520	6758080	I will say Howard the Duck was on it.
6758080	6759580	Howard the Duck was on it?
6759580	6760580	As was Ishtar.
6760580	6762960	I love Howard the Duck.
6762960	6765640	That's one of my favorite, was Xanadu on there.
6765640	6767240	Xanadu was on there.
6767240	6768240	No!
6768240	6769640	I love Xanadu!
6769640	6772040	Yeah, I don't know how Manos The Hands of Fate wasn't on here.
6772040	6774080	It was a pretty poorly done documentary.
6774080	6778400	Maybe they only had access to one studio's films or something, but yeah, I gotta figure
6778400	6780400	out what that, what the name of that movie was.
6780400	6781400	Hold on, I'm getting it right now.
6781400	6782400	Okay.
6782400	6783400	I'll have the...
6783400	6784880	If you say the name, I'll remember it.
6784880	6785880	Okay.
6785880	6786880	DarkSaga, recent emails.
6786880	6788880	I'm going to play music again because we got on a tangent.
6788880	6789880	Surprise!
6789880	6790880	Fighting Life!
6790880	6791880	No, that wasn't the name of it.
6791880	6795360	It says The Crippled, oh, The Crippled Masters.
6795360	6796360	That's it.
6796360	6797360	The Crippled Masters.
6797360	6798360	That's what it was called.
6798360	6799360	The Crippled Masters.
6799360	6802360	Fighting Life is the sequel, I guess.
6802360	6804000	Amazing.
6804000	6806000	It had a sequel?
6806000	6807000	Fuck.
6807000	6808080	The Crippled Masters.
6808080	6809280	That's what it was called.
6809280	6811200	How about some emails?
6811200	6812200	How about it?
6812200	6814000	Dun dun dun!
6814000	6816000	This comes from GS68.
6816000	6817000	Hey O.L.R.
6817000	6818000	Crew.
6818000	6819000	Wait, wait, wait.
6819000	6820000	I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
6820000	6821000	Oh no!
6821000	6822000	In return!
6822000	6825720	In The Crippled Masters, they actually attached themselves to each other to create that person
6825720	6829640	that I was saying they should do it.
6829640	6831200	That's awesome.
6831200	6835480	It says right here, so the two men are disfigured by their evil leader.
6835480	6838880	It says one man has his arms cut off, the other has his legs burned off with acid.
6838880	6841880	The two men are enemies but struggling with being disabled.
6841880	6846840	One day, fighting each other, the wise old yoga master suggests they work together and
6846840	6856400	start training with weapons and team up to help them with the help of a shoulder harness
6856400	6861360	so that the man without the use of gloves lays or he meets the army for the other man
6861360	6862560	and vice versa.
6862560	6866640	Three words better than Voltron.
6866640	6867640	That's awesome.
6867640	6873680	Okay, I'm watching this scene where they cut his arms off and this is pretty bad.
6873680	6875080	I like it.
6875080	6876560	I have no arms.
6876560	6878960	Lowkey, you promise not to interrupt the emails now.
6878960	6880800	Alright, here we go.
6880800	6881800	Ew!
6881800	6882800	God, that is disgusting.
6882800	6883800	Okay.
6883800	6884800	I'm sorry.
6884800	6885800	Here we go.
6885800	6886800	One more time.
6886800	6888340	Oh, I have a question actually, Rob.
6888340	6890240	Was The House Where Evil Dwells on there?
6890240	6891800	I don't remember.
6891800	6892800	I don't think so.
6892800	6893800	That's the movie?
6893800	6897040	They had some really fucked up movie from the 70s though that was like just a total
6897040	6900080	gore film and had titties and butts and blood and stuff.
6900080	6901080	I don't remember what the name was.
6901080	6902080	It was awful.
6902080	6903080	I love The House Where Evil Dwells.
6903080	6904080	Okay.
6904080	6905080	I have a little story about this and then I'll do email.
6905080	6906080	Promise.
6906080	6907080	Promise.
6907080	6908080	Promise.
6908080	6909080	I love what Act Deaf said in chat.
6909080	6910680	The Crippled Masters of Independent Podcasting.
6910680	6913000	No, that might be offensive though.
6913000	6914360	There are people that are actually handicapped.
6914360	6917760	There are actually crippled masters out there who do podcasts.
6917760	6921460	But you have to admit it's an awesome idea for a movie.
6921460	6922880	It's not that the people have no...
6922880	6924600	But the fact that it's like that...
6924600	6929320	What was that movie with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder where one was deaf and one was...
6929320	6930840	See No Evil Here No Evil.
6930840	6932200	It's like that but karate.
6932200	6933560	Okay, sorry Jamie.
6933560	6936160	Your point.
6936160	6937160	Okay.
6937160	6938160	So this movie...
6938160	6939160	It was...
6939160	6940160	Okay.
6940160	6942020	I saw it when I was like six.
6942020	6943020	Something like that.
6943020	6944020	And it was on Showtime.
6944020	6946580	Back when Showtime was new.
6946580	6950520	And it was at the time called The House Where Evil Dwells and I had no idea that was the
6950520	6951520	name of it.
6951520	6956400	I just remembered that it's about these people that move to Japan and get possessed by ghosts
6956400	6958740	and end up killing each other.
6958740	6961480	Like the ghosts killed each other.
6961480	6964620	And I had been trying for years.
6964620	6967400	I mean decades to find this movie.
6967400	6968880	I did not remember the name of it.
6968880	6971120	I was so little I didn't remember.
6971120	6975700	But I remembered scenes from it including the ghost possessed crabs chasing the girl
6975700	6976760	at the tree.
6976760	6978640	Which is why evil alien crabs always...
6978640	6980560	Giant alien crabs always make me crack the fuck up.
6980560	6983120	Because I always remember they go to ROAR sound.
6983120	6987080	But you know like you hear like the...
6987080	6990720	For lack of a better description I guess like the Japanese ghost noise.
6990720	6993320	You know that sounds like really deep.
6993320	6994320	You know.
6994320	6995320	Anyway.
6995320	6996320	No.
6996320	6999680	That's a broken neck ghost woman.
6999680	7003680	And that's more like...
7003680	7004680	Anyway.
7004680	7005680	This show's terrible.
7005680	7006680	So.
7006680	7007680	Shut up.
7007680	7008680	Anyway.
7008680	7009680	So.
7009680	7010680	So.
7010680	7011680	At last.
7011680	7014000	I think six months ago I finally.
7014000	7016600	Finally found a review of the damn movie.
7016600	7019440	Found the name of it and bought it on Amazon for five bucks.
7019440	7021680	And I'm making you watch it with me.
7021680	7023320	No.
7023320	7024880	You want some stuff that's gonna do with me?
7024880	7028280	Okay but we have to find the cheerleader movie that was on that list and watch that too because
7028280	7029280	that looked amazing.
7029280	7031440	I want to see a cheerleader movie.
7031440	7032440	Alright.
7032440	7033440	Do we get to...
7033440	7034440	No.
7034440	7035440	Are they naked?
7035440	7036440	Can we do email now?
7036440	7037440	Sure.
7037440	7043440	But you totally need to see this movie.
7043440	7044440	Okay.
7044440	7045440	God.
7045440	7050320	So.
7050320	7052320	First email from GS68.
7052320	7056200	Hey OLR crew.
7056200	7060960	If you've already covered what I just brought up in the subject line just ignore this email.
7060960	7065360	But anyways Sunnyvale Goughland is holding a location test for the North American version
7065360	7069840	of DJ Max Technica sometime next week.
7069840	7074080	Somewhere in the December 17th to 19th range and I thought I'd share this with you guys.
7074080	7078760	Kudos to Corey Vertu from BimaniStyle for bringing this up.
7078760	7082240	I'm texting Shane right now to get a reaction out of him because I don't know anyone that
7082240	7084640	loves this game more than him and he's going to be pissed.
7084640	7089200	I encourage people living in NorCal who are interested in Technica to come check it out.
7089200	7095600	GS68 PS this email was brought to you by Tetris the Grandmaster, home of the ending Tetrominoes.
7095600	7096600	Okay.
7096600	7097600	I.
7097600	7098600	Okay.
7098600	7100600	So DJ Max.
7100600	7101600	Yo.
7101600	7106120	Have you seen this new one yet?
7106120	7107440	I'm curious to check it out.
7107440	7108800	Shane made me watch YouTubes of it.
7108800	7109800	It looks interesting.
7109800	7110800	Yeah.
7110800	7111800	With the whole like, with the touch.
7111800	7113440	It doesn't look anything like the PSP one to me.
7113440	7115440	It's just the same music.
7115440	7118280	I'd be curious to check it out.
7118280	7119400	So moving forward.
7119400	7122120	I might have to make, I don't have any plans next weekend.
7122120	7123120	Okay.
7123120	7125120	Actually I have plans.
7125120	7126120	Cancel them.
7126120	7128500	I'm going to Old Folsom and eating good food.
7128500	7129500	And shopping.
7129500	7132280	I'm going to eat good food and shop in the bay and play DJ Max.
7132280	7133720	Who are you going with?
7133720	7134720	Becky.
7134720	7135720	Bring Becky.
7135720	7138720	She's not into video games.
7138720	7139720	Oh.
7139720	7140720	Damn her.
7140720	7141720	I'm just kidding.
7141720	7142720	That and she has a child.
7142720	7143720	All right.
7143720	7144720	Fair enough.
7144720	7145720	Who is teething.
7145720	7147360	Oh my God.
7147360	7148360	So moving forward.
7148360	7149360	Hey guys.
7149360	7150360	Loki.
7150360	7154520	A few episodes back you said that Wii music is for five year olds.
7154520	7155840	I object.
7155840	7160280	My recently turned six brother loves to play video games and not only games.
7160280	7162340	He plays Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.
7162340	7166220	He strums and he yells at me to press the buttons while we work our way through Slow
7166220	7167680	Ride.
7167680	7169720	There's your lol for the day.
7169720	7170720	P.S.
7170720	7171720	Skye.
7171720	7176000	Put the podcast up faster.
7176000	7177000	P.P.S.
7177000	7179320	I hope I pass the grammar Nazi test.
7179320	7180960	This is Orange Lounge.
7180960	7181960	Geekboy2424.
7181960	7183560	Think of it this way.
7183560	7185400	You're going to get an awesome Christmas present pretty soon.
7185400	7188120	Put in an ellipsis where you're not supposed to by the way.
7188120	7192920	You're supposed to use two dashes and not an ellipsis.
7192920	7195120	I'll take care of that later.
7195120	7196480	No lecture tonight.
7196480	7200040	However, the last email is fantastic grammar.
7200040	7201040	I find it beautiful.
7201040	7205680	It actually is a card sent to us.
7205680	7211320	It's actually sent to us from our friends at Super Happy Fun Time Show.
7211320	7214760	Super Happy Fun Time Show?
7214760	7215760	I hate that show.
7215760	7216760	No, I'm kidding.
7216760	7217760	It's great.
7217760	7221520	Please find attached our Christmas to you all at O.O.R.
7221520	7226240	We're not sending analog versions out as we're trying to save the planet.
7226240	7230640	Have a great Christmas and New Year and we'll see you on the other side, whatever that means.
7230640	7234120	That's a very creative idea to do your Christmas cards digitally.
7234120	7235920	So I would like to see some holiday cards.
7235920	7237960	I don't want to say Christmas because that's insensitive.
7237960	7241800	I want Christmas cards.
7241800	7245840	I want it fucking loaded with baby Jesus.
7245840	7249720	Okay, then fine.
7249720	7253000	For this week's mailbag, we would like to challenge you to send us Christmas cards and
7253000	7257880	they better be about Christmas and Jesus and Santa and all that stuff.
7257880	7263960	Unless you want to do them about original Christmas and that's with yule logs burning
7263960	7267000	and candles on trees and druids sacrificing things.
7267000	7268000	Fine, look, whatever.
7268000	7270400	We want your Christmas cards via email this week.
7270400	7273280	So mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.
7273280	7274280	I like that.
7274280	7277040	And your banners for the PSP website, damn it.
7277040	7280880	VXJ6V, yes, that's a creative idea because I'm not talking about someone signing on to
7280880	7282840	like Yahoo greeting cards or whatever.
7282840	7283840	I'm talking about they actually...
7283840	7286200	We want you to get into Photoshop and make it your damn self.
7286200	7289040	Yeah, they made one and let me, maybe I should make that clear because I don't want to see
7289040	7290480	the same damn e-card over and over.
7290480	7294240	They actually made a Photoshop little card that was cute.
7294240	7295240	It was.
7295240	7297640	It was very nice and we appreciate it very much.
7297640	7305320	I actually mailed all of four real Christmas cards this year and they were pretty cool.
7305320	7307440	That's it for emails, I think.
7307440	7308440	Is that it?
7308440	7309440	Nope.
7309440	7310440	We got some spam.
7310440	7311440	Fuck you.
7311440	7312440	All confirmed at eBay.com.
7312440	7313440	You shit.
7313440	7314440	Done?
7314440	7316080	All right, there you go.
7316080	7320120	If you want to send us emails, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.
7320120	7321120	Back to the gaming news.
7321120	7322120	Loki.
7322120	7323120	All right.
7323120	7324640	Well, let's see here.
7324640	7326680	We've got some other interesting stuff.
7326680	7330320	This is a game that I was playing quite a bit right after it came out.
7330320	7335800	I kind of put it off now since I have other things to be playing, but I want to go back
7335800	7338880	and maybe this will entice me.
7338880	7342020	Mercenaries 2 is getting some new download content.
7342020	7350480	They kind of teased this a little bit a while ago with their Obama and Sarah Palin characters.
7350480	7354560	Well, this is all going to be part of the Blow It Up Again download content pack.
7354560	7362960	It is going to be free and it is going to contain a bunch of cool stuff, including some
7362960	7364560	new modes.
7364560	7368560	They're going to have four new game types, including there is one that looked like a
7368560	7378080	death race or something like that, and some other fun explosion-based games, which is
7378080	7379080	kind of cool.
7379080	7389360	Apparently, it will be coming out on the Marketplace December 16th, so that's pretty awesome for
7389360	7390360	PS3 owners.
7390360	7394480	I think the 360 is already out.
7394480	7395480	All right.
7395480	7399920	Well, if you want to continue to expand the games that you might own, Guitar Hero World
7399920	7405600	Tour is going to be offering five free download tracks, but only if you own the guitar bundle
7405600	7406600	of the game.
7406600	7411160	So not buying the game by itself, not buying the big band box, just buying guitar and game
7411160	7412160	by itself.
7412160	7415160	Supposedly, you're going to be getting five free songs, and here's the thing.
7415160	7418240	It's not five pre-selected songs like it was a rock band.
7418240	7421840	You'll just get to choose five free downloadable tracks.
7421840	7423680	Details coming soon.
7423680	7427280	That's all we know right now, apparently, is that if you get the $90 guitar game bundle,
7427280	7431040	you will get to choose five tracks to download.
7431040	7434840	And I guess free is good, but it's kind of weird that they're doing it for just the guitar
7434840	7435840	bundle.
7435840	7437480	Does that strike anyone else as odd?
7437480	7438480	Yeah.
7438480	7441240	I think they're desperate because people already have guitars.
7441240	7442240	You know what?
7442240	7445720	I actually almost bought Guitar Hero World Tour.
7445720	7448880	Every song in the song list that I really, really wanted to play was pretty much already
7448880	7449880	in rock band.
7449880	7450880	I feel bad.
7450880	7453400	I feel like rock band's so much better than Guitar Hero.
7453400	7457500	I mean, it's so much more versatile, has a lot more tracks to play.
7457500	7460160	We met some real nice people that worked on Guitar Hero at PAX.
7460160	7461160	That is true.
7461160	7466360	But one thing I am excited about, though, is the music mixer.
7466360	7467640	The studio mode.
7467640	7468640	It's limited.
7468640	7469640	Really?
7469640	7470640	Yeah.
7470640	7472360	So, I don't know.
7472360	7473360	It's...
7473360	7474360	We'll see.
7474360	7476720	Maybe when it comes down in price a little bit.
7476720	7478880	I think the price is one thing I'm having a hard time justifying.
7478880	7480480	I do really need a new guitar, though.
7480480	7482840	In fact, I was playing the No Doubt stuff in rock band.
7482840	7486040	Maybe if they get better downloads, too, I'd be on board.
7486040	7488140	No Doubt has that album, right?
7488140	7490280	And my roommate was watching me play it and was like, ah, it's too bad you don't have
7490280	7491280	a second guitar.
7491280	7492280	I actually want to play rock band right now.
7492280	7493280	This is pretty cool.
7493280	7496840	And I'm like, oh, I need to get a second guitar anyway, because I'm still using the Explorer.
7496840	7497840	Still.
7497840	7501360	And TigerClaw says, why buy the game when SingStar Abba was all you cared for?
7501360	7505640	I can't believe I left that out of my gaming week, but I did play SingStar Abba last night.
7505640	7506640	It was a lot of fun.
7506640	7507640	Mm-hmm.
7507640	7508640	Yep, yep.
7508640	7511640	There you go.
7511640	7517280	Well, this is definitely for the UK.
7517280	7521040	In February, Rise of the Argonauts is going to be coming out.
7521040	7527600	It's an action role play game that's being put out by Codemasters.
7527600	7538200	They're actually, it's already out on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 everywhere else in Europe.
7538200	7545600	However, the UK version had some problems with actually having space for the game.
7545600	7548600	It really was only a retail issue.
7548600	7553360	The publisher actually said that they tried to get it into retail in the UK, along with
7553360	7558720	the others, but it was so busy they could not do it, so they actually delayed the UK
7558720	7561880	launch, simply for retail reasons.
7561880	7568000	It actually was supposed to be out in the US on February 16th, and everybody else as
7568000	7569000	of Friday.
7569000	7570000	Hmm.
7570000	7571000	All righty.
7571000	7572000	Cool.
7572000	7581040	Let's see, you may remember back, man, I can't believe it's already been like over a year,
7581040	7588060	but Bioshock, they had some limited editions that came out that had the Bioshock Big Daddy
7588060	7589760	figurine with it.
7589760	7596560	Well, now to go with the Big Daddy is A Little Sister, and you'll actually be able to purchase
7596560	7597560	these.
7597560	7603360	They're from the Cult of Rapture, I'm not sure if they're actually being sold through
7603360	7608800	the website or not, but yeah, it's going to be a little sister figurine that will go along
7608800	7610280	with it.
7610280	7614320	That's kind of neat.
7614320	7619520	No word on pricing or when it's going to be available, but soon I guess.
7619520	7621240	All right.
7621240	7626920	Hey, something that's available, Pac-Man is coming out on the mobile phones, and here's
7626920	7631200	the interesting thing, it just came out in Europe, apparently, it's a mobile version.
7631200	7637920	256 levels, because the original arcade version also cracked out after 256 levels, but what's
7637920	7643360	cool about this, the mobile game actually supports local matches via Bluetooth, and
7643360	7646320	remember the awesome game Pac-Man Versus, and what was so awesome about that?
7646320	7650360	You could play as the ghost, you can do that in this mobile version as well.
7650360	7656760	Now here's the thing, there is that kind of like fog or limited vision on the mobile phone,
7656760	7660760	but you know what, still kind of awesome.
7660760	7665240	So there you go, if you're a mobile gamer and looking for a game to get, being able
7665240	7668440	to play as the ghost definitely puts a whole new twist on Pac-Man, so that's available
7668440	7672600	right now in Europe, and I'm sure we'll come over here soon.
7672600	7679120	Well here's some happy news for Nintendo fans in the States, the DSi is supposed to be coming
7679120	7684880	to North America in March 2009, which we knew we'd be getting it, I mean it's not like they
7684880	7689120	wouldn't release it over here, but it's kind of nice to have a date, don't you think?
7689120	7692560	It's already out in Japan, and so we've been hearing all about it, and I'm sure people
7692560	7697000	have imported it already, but now you don't have to, if you have patience.
7697000	7698000	Patience.
7698000	7700120	It's a virtue.
7700120	7704160	Sadly, I'm not virtuous, but oh well, I have to because I'm poor.
7704160	7706520	I want it now, Daddy!
7706520	7707960	Do you want the goose that lays a golden egg?
7707960	7711520	I want a goose that lays a golden egg!
7711520	7715880	And it's also a very stressful episode on Wonder Shosen.
7715880	7718960	Patience, patience, patience, patience, patience.
7718960	7721200	God, I love Wonder Shosen.
7721200	7722200	I'm so sad that show only went.
7722200	7723200	Never watched any.
7723200	7724960	Oh, Jamie, you are missing out.
7724960	7727960	Okay, if you're going to make me watch your crappy movie, I'm making you watch Wonder
7727960	7728960	Shosen.
7728960	7729960	Hey!
7729960	7730960	It is a crappy movie, but it is fun-crappy.
7730960	7733680	It's the hot dog highway!
7733680	7735240	Daddy!
7735240	7736920	Mortimer!
7736920	7745960	Anyways, there's a new game coming out called Treasure Trove, which is kind of an interesting
7745960	7746960	name.
7746960	7751880	Basically, it's a game coming over from Asper Software, and what's unique about this game
7751880	7756840	though is it's sort of got a little bit of an augmented reality twist to it.
7756840	7762760	Basically, you'll play this game actually walking around, and it will pick up on Wi-Fi
7762760	7765600	signals that are nearby.
7765600	7770520	And based on those Wi-Fi signals, it will kind of create treasures for you to be able
7770520	7771600	to collect.
7771600	7774900	So you can actually walk around different places and find different treasures.
7774900	7777340	It's like a real-life treasure hunt, I guess.
7777340	7782960	You might also remember that I want to say Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops did something
7782960	7786320	similar to that effect as well.
7786320	7793680	In fact, I think you could get different unlockable characters based on Wi-Fi spots.
7793680	7794680	So that's kind of neat.
7794680	7801040	I don't know if I like the fact that I have to walk around to find these Wi-Fi spots,
7801040	7806520	but neat nonetheless.
7806520	7807520	Kind of interesting.
7807520	7811400	Is this kind of like the whole, what do they call it, geocaching thing?
7811400	7814880	Sort of, but not quite as cool.
7814880	7820200	Tigerclaw says, I bet the treasures are actually just open Wi-Fi networks.
7820200	7822280	That would be a treasure.
7822280	7828040	Hey, one more story about an announcement, possible announcement, coming to Consumer
7828040	7829040	Electronics Show.
7829040	7830040	This could be some big gaming news.
7830040	7837080	It's just a rumor, however it's coming from a research analyst for the firm Global Equities.
7837080	7843800	Apparently Microsoft could be unveiling a Zune phone at Consumer Electronics Show.
7843800	7847200	Apparently the Zune phone, you can guess what it's probably trying to compete with, but
7847200	7849080	it's supposed to have motion enhancement features.
7849080	7853200	It would actually have an accelerometer in it, a large multimedia screen in it, and a
7853200	7856560	keyboard I guess that is on the screen.
7856560	7860040	Now of course, the interesting thing about it is that although nothing is really said
7860040	7863680	about gaming right away, you would think, especially with the way the other big phone
7863680	7867920	is going, and especially because Microsoft has that tie into the 360, and they've always
7867920	7870360	talked about that whole live anywhere thing.
7870360	7874960	And they also showed off those downloadable XNA titles to the Zune.
7874960	7880720	This would be really a great bridge between all that, especially with so many community
7880720	7881720	games.
7881720	7886000	The community thing has really exploded out there, and grad store buddy Aaron, who appears
7886000	7890880	to still be in the top 15 of the games on the community games, amongst all the stuff
7890880	7892760	that's out there right now, props to him.
7892760	7895680	But that would be very interesting if all these XNA games could suddenly be playable
7895680	7896680	on the phone.
7896680	7900560	It's like they'd have this huge base of already made things.
7900560	7901560	Excellent idea.
7901560	7902560	We'll see.
7902560	7906480	Although, I don't know, if they actually put out a Zune phone, would that be something you'd
7906480	7907480	be interested in, Loki?
7907480	7909240	Because I know you're like an Apple hater.
7909240	7912880	You know, Dark Soccer and I already have iPhones, so I can pretty much guess Dark Soccer would
7912880	7916360	have the same answer I would, that I'm locked into this phone for two years, even if I wanted
7916360	7917360	one, I couldn't get it.
7917360	7918800	But you, Loki, would you be interested?
7918800	7924280	Not really, because usually with those plans for a phone like that, they have data plans,
7924280	7926280	and it's expensive.
7926280	7930800	I don't use my phone for browsing the internet and stuff, although I would probably like
7930800	7933880	doing that, because it would come in handy sometimes.
7933880	7937660	But it would all depend.
7937660	7943320	Maybe if they made a standalone Zune player that also played games, and you can download
7943320	7946720	stuff maybe not the phone, then I might be interested in it.
7946720	7951840	But it's not something I'm actually going to purchase as a phone.
7951840	7955900	Rama in chat says, OK, Microsoft, you already have smartphones and Pocket PC's phones that
7955900	7956900	are on the market.
7956900	7958280	That's a whole lot better than iPhones.
7958280	7961840	You don't need a damn Zune phone.
7961840	7962840	We'll see.
7962840	7964640	All right.
7964640	7967720	That does it for stories tonight, and we'll get to some last minute stories in just a
7967720	7968720	moment.
7968720	7972400	But we are going to open up the Skype line right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username
7972400	7973760	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7973760	7976320	If you wanted to call and talk about the show tonight, please give us a call.
7976320	7980360	We're only going to take a couple calls tonight, because we want to make sure we have time
7980360	7983720	after the show for the Justin TV thing with Tatsunoko and Capcom.
7983720	7987720	So we're going to try to abbreviate this so we get Loki home on time and not in trouble.
7987720	7988720	And then I just want to...
7988720	7989720	Well, I appreciate that.
7989720	7990720	We don't need to do that.
7990720	7991720	I don't want to stay up all night either.
7991720	7992720	So...
7992720	7993720	It's freaking cold in here.
7993720	7994720	It is very cold in here.
7994720	7997720	So yeah, we're going to just take a couple quick calls while we're waiting for a call.
7997720	7999720	Loki, you want to do some last minute stories?
7999720	8000720	Yes.
8000720	8007040	There's a weird game that this company is showing off.
8007040	8010080	3D-AUS has a game called Funny Band.
8010080	8015840	It's a Korean developer that's put it out, and it has a peripheral that combines both
8015840	8018120	a keyboard, a guitar, and drum set.
8018120	8020440	Now, you may ask, how the hell are they doing that?
8020440	8023360	Well, the guitar looks kind of like a rock band guitar.
8023360	8026960	It has four frets on top, two frets on the bottom.
8026960	8030740	And then also on that, there are two sets of keys.
8030740	8036920	There's four keys on the bottom and three keys on the top, kind of, of the base of the
8036920	8037920	guitar.
8037920	8041220	And you flip the guitar over, and there's six drum pads.
8041220	8042680	So that's kind of neat.
8042680	8045920	And the game itself kind of looks a little bit like, you know, a guitar hero or a rock
8045920	8046920	band.
8046920	8053000	But what's kind of cool is the actual board that the notes scroll down is kind of curved.
8053000	8058160	So it's like, kind of, I don't know, the end of, like, Splash Mountain or something.
8058160	8062440	But the game itself looks kind of cool, and no word on exactly when it's coming out.
8062440	8068440	But very neat, and a good way, I guess, to have all your peripherals in one spot.
8068440	8071880	Sucks that you can't play drums and guitar though at the same time, not without it being
8071880	8076200	very uncomfortable.
8076200	8081640	Something else that's coming out, Brutal Legend, of course, was shown off during the Video
8081640	8083920	Game Awards show tonight.
8083920	8086600	And EA is now bringing that game out.
8086600	8093200	Of course, this used to be one of the properties of Nvidia before they got bought up by Activision.
8093200	8099440	And now EA is putting out yet another game, a little bit different, not going to see Brutal
8099440	8105680	Legend, you know, 2010 or something like that, but neat nonetheless.
8105680	8108600	And then we were talking a little bit before about DJ Max Technica.
8108600	8112280	Well, DJ Max Technica is actually coming to the DS.
8112280	8117280	And they're going to be doing a DS game that's going to also have some DSi features as well.
8117280	8122060	It's going to also use a DSi camera and have storage support, which is kind of cool.
8122060	8125600	But very cool to see that this is going to be coming to the DS.
8125600	8130280	I guess it'd be perfect since it's a touchscreen game, and the PSP versions have done very
8130280	8131280	well as well.
8131280	8134880	All right, now we're finally getting calls, because apparently our Skype was on Don't
8134880	8137880	Disturb or something, and I finally figured that out thanks to a chat comment.
8137880	8139320	And to reset it, now we've got a call.
8139320	8140640	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8140640	8141640	Who's this?
8141640	8142640	Hello, Orange Launch Radio.
8142640	8143640	It is Jason.
8143640	8144640	Hello, Jason.
8144640	8146320	I come from the internet.
8146320	8148440	I was getting a little worried that no one was going to call tonight.
8148440	8151280	I was like, that's a little embarrassing, but then I realized...
8151280	8156440	You were online the whole time, ever since you came on to do the tossover with Bobby.
8156440	8162480	Yeah, usually we turn it off for the first hour and a half, but I got lazy tonight.
8162480	8163480	Well what's up, Jason?
8163480	8165160	Oh, not too much.
8165160	8167480	Just chilling in three degree weather.
8167480	8168480	Just chilling.
8168480	8172300	That's what it feels like here, even though it'd probably kill us if we told you how cold
8172300	8173400	it actually is here.
8173400	8175680	You'd probably be like, you're fucking babies.
8175680	8176680	For the record...
8176680	8177680	It's okay.
8177680	8181320	This weather would have frozen me if I had still lived in Arizona at the time, so I could
8181320	8182320	definitely understand.
8182320	8185320	47 degrees out, by the way.
8185320	8186320	Whips.
8186320	8187320	Whips.
8187320	8189040	That's what, a Colorado summer?
8189040	8190040	All right, no, I'm kidding.
8190040	8191760	What's up, Jason?
8191760	8192760	That's it.
8192760	8194800	That's pretty close, actually.
8194800	8198120	I have had notes open ever since the start of the show.
8198120	8199120	Home.
8199120	8201120	Hooray, home.
8201120	8205640	It's funny, because when you said that this was something that was popular in the 90s,
8205640	8208680	all of these memories came fluttering back.
8208680	8211880	There was two things that stood out.
8211880	8214600	One of them was a company called World's 3D that...
8214600	8216880	I remember World's 3D.
8216880	8217880	I never...
8217880	8222440	The sad thing is I've never actually used any of these 3D World products back then.
8222440	8223600	I didn't have my own computer.
8223600	8224600	I was young.
8224600	8226440	I didn't know nearly as much as I do now.
8226440	8228720	You know, that kind of stuff.
8228720	8232680	World's 3D came out and tried to do this.
8232680	8239960	I don't know if that's what ZDNet, the precursor to Tech TV, if that's what ZDTV spotlighted
8239960	8244520	at one point, but I remember seeing a 3D interface for web browsing.
8244520	8245800	And you know what?
8245800	8248560	It doesn't work.
8248560	8249660	It's slow.
8249660	8253040	We have a great interface for browsing the web.
8253040	8254800	They're called web browsers.
8254800	8257120	It presents everything in a great medium.
8257120	8260280	What a concept.
8260280	8262600	So you think home is just stupid, or what?
8262600	8265080	It's...
8265080	8267800	Bobby had it right, and I've said this to a couple people in the chat room, and I think
8267800	8270160	you even echoed it at the same time.
8270160	8273720	You want to compare it to Second Life, but you can't compare it to Second Life.
8273720	8278040	Second Life is a game in the sense that you have production and you can play other people's
8278040	8280240	production and whatnot.
8280240	8283240	Home is an interface to...
8283240	8290000	I mean, it's an alternative to the XMB, you could say, with the fact that they're trying
8290000	8293120	to integrate partying and game launching and that kind of stuff.
8293120	8298600	Yes, it's a cross-media bar that says, fuck shit, nay, and fat, and all that stuff, you
8298600	8299600	know?
8299600	8302680	Yeah, it's another interface, and you know what?
8302680	8309080	It's slow, and it takes forever, and it just doesn't work as well.
8309080	8310080	That's not the...
8310080	8311560	Well, that's natural.
8311560	8313840	It doesn't work on the digital mediums.
8313840	8317080	It's not that smart.
8317080	8321280	Well, you said you've been taking notes during the show.
8321280	8323160	What else did you want to comment on?
8323160	8324200	It was just a lot of this.
8324200	8325780	It's kind of funny.
8325780	8330480	Some of the things that Rai pointed out was that the repeated loading and downloading
8330480	8334800	of all of the zones in the home reminded us an awful lot of Metal Gear Solid 4, the fact
8334800	8340400	that you had to install more than every chapter worth of the game.
8340400	8342040	That was aggravating.
8342040	8344560	That was the worst thing I've ever seen in a game.
8344560	8347860	Did you know that Prince of Persia is the first PlayStation 3 game I've bought that
8347860	8351280	had to do the installation thing, and it kind of caught me off guard?
8351280	8357120	I was like, whoa, hey, I forgot PS3 games do this, because all the other PS3 games I
8357120	8360320	have, LittleBigPlanet didn't really do it, and it might have, but I totally didn't notice
8360320	8361320	it.
8361320	8362320	It did.
8362320	8363320	It's small.
8363320	8364320	I just didn't notice it.
8364320	8365320	I think I was doing something wrong.
8365320	8366320	You notice that there's no more stories about those anymore?
8366320	8368280	It's because every game does it now.
8368280	8371840	I was actually going to say and ask the same thing about LittleBigPlanet.
8371840	8373580	I don't remember an install.
8373580	8377080	It did it, but it's just kind of short, and so is the Prince of Persia one.
8377080	8381000	You'll notice the first time you play the game, it's slow to boot up, and I was like,
8381000	8383880	oh, this shit's installing on my hard drive right now, and sure enough, every time I've
8383880	8386520	booted it since then, boop, comes right up.
8386520	8388760	That's just so weird to me.
8388760	8391440	But PC games have done this for years, right?
8391440	8393200	That's a PC.
8393200	8396680	The difference between a PC and a PC is that you have to support a lot.
8396680	8402960	In a game console, developers should already know exactly what they need to do.
8402960	8409920	I mean, you can say the same thing for download content, but I don't know.
8409920	8414280	It just seems really weird in the way that the PC is kind of graying out with consoles
8414280	8415280	nowadays.
8415280	8416640	Let me say this, Jason.
8416640	8419360	To me, it's weird, but it's not a deal breaker.
8419360	8422600	I can put up with it, especially if it's just once at the beginning of the thing.
8422600	8425780	I would only be more pissed off if it kept happening throughout the whole thing, which
8425780	8427960	it sounds like it happens in Metal Gear Solid 4.
8427960	8428960	Oh, my God.
8428960	8434000	And it's funny, because the first time it installs, it takes something like 10 or 20
8434000	8436720	minutes, I think, if memory serves correctly.
8436720	8439860	And then every additional time it installs, it takes about three minutes.
8439860	8441400	And I swear to God, it's a three minute.
8441400	8444780	When we were playing through it and Wright was watching me play, when we were playing
8444780	8447940	through it and we would get to these stupid installs, I would say, it's a three minute
8447940	8454000	Marlboro commercial, because Old Snake is sitting there smoking away right in your face
8454000	8457680	for three minutes, and nothing else is going on.
8457680	8460280	He's just sitting there huffing and puffing.
8460280	8461280	Comment from chat.
8461280	8464760	Legend of Zaku says, bullshit, PC games installed faster than PS3 games.
8464760	8468240	I got three words for you, Final Fantasy XI.
8468240	8471160	You can't count download time.
8471160	8472480	Download patches and updates towards that level.
8472480	8475280	Well, even the game itself spawns across like four CDs.
8475280	8476280	It's crazy.
8476280	8477280	I don't even remember.
8477280	8478280	All right, forget it.
8478280	8479280	It doesn't matter.
8479280	8480280	It's been too long.
8480280	8481880	I understand the point he's trying to make, that some of those PS3 installs are very long,
8481880	8482880	but you know.
8482880	8485880	Anyway, Jason, I've got to rush you along, because we've got to take some more calls.
8485880	8488080	Is there anything else you want to comment on tonight?
8488080	8493060	One thing that I do want to say for myself, as much as I have a disdain for it, I think
8493060	8495760	everything we say about home is a preview.
8495760	8496760	It's not a review.
8496760	8500260	There's very little content in there, and until we can start seeing things like clubs
8500260	8504680	really happening, and club houses, and anything else that they actually do decide to sell,
8504680	8508480	as soon as it's actually flourishing, it's a preview.
8508480	8512940	But Jason, when you open it up to the masses like Sony has, that's not how everybody's
8512940	8513940	going to view it.
8513940	8515940	People are going to download this and go, this is home?
8515940	8516940	This is bullshit.
8516940	8517940	And they're not going to look at it again.
8517940	8522440	They've shrugged it off as the whole beta thing, but...
8522440	8524800	I mean, they've pushed it to the cross-media bar.
8524800	8525800	You have a point.
8525800	8526800	It's right there.
8526800	8527800	Yeah.
8527800	8528800	Yeah.
8528800	8531440	It definitely popped up as soon as I found out that it was open for everybody.
8531440	8532440	I don't know.
8532440	8534720	I stand by my comment, but I certainly understand yours.
8534720	8538920	Okay, Jason, I think home is going to be one of those things that's a lot cooler in a year.
8538920	8544100	It's like the PS3 itself, it's not going to realize its potential for like a year.
8544100	8545100	That's a good point.
8545100	8548920	Well, Lord knows we didn't buy our PS3 until recently, because the library, we didn't care
8548920	8549920	about it.
8549920	8550920	Yeah.
8550920	8554800	We didn't have a need for Blu-Ray, which has also changed now, Blu-Ray movies, that
8554800	8555800	is.
8555800	8556800	Yeah, yeah.
8556800	8557800	All right.
8557800	8559800	Well, Jason, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank you
8559800	8562040	so much for the call tonight, and you have a good one.
8562040	8563040	Bye, guys.
8563040	8564040	All right.
8564040	8565040	Bye-bye.
8565040	8568160	All right, if you want to give us a call, we'll do at least one more call, try to sneak
8568160	8569160	two in.
8569160	8572840	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8572840	8575680	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8575680	8576680	Who's this?
8576680	8577680	Hey, hey.
8577680	8578680	It's your buddy from New York, Rama.
8578680	8580440	Well, hello, buddy from New York, Rama.
8580440	8581440	How you doing?
8581440	8582440	I'm pretty good.
8582440	8586720	I was cold early, but now I'm happy I'm home.
8586720	8588280	What's on your mind?
8588280	8589280	Not much.
8589280	8592760	I tried to call you guys last week, but since SSJ100Man had told me you guys didn't have
8592760	8595280	the 1-800 number, I had gone into an interesting...
8595280	8596720	Yeah, we had issues last week.
8596720	8597720	Sorry.
8597720	8602520	Don't we all have issues once in a while?
8602520	8603520	Yes.
8603520	8610680	Yeah, but I had gone to an interesting concert last week and called Blip Fest 2008.
8610680	8612400	I'm going to post a link in the chat.
8612400	8622720	It's blipfestival.org, but basically, once a year, it's a concert of all types of classic
8622720	8629640	8-bit programmers and gamers alike that program in with NES, Commodore 64, and they do all
8629640	8631840	kinds of various music with it.
8631840	8638520	Sorry, I've been looking at the Wii stuff for setting up for After Show.
8638520	8639520	I've been talking to you.
8639520	8643800	I haven't looked at the website, but let me look.
8643800	8645320	What convinced you to go out to the show?
8645320	8647920	Well, a friend of mine told me about it last year.
8647920	8651960	I couldn't get it, and I couldn't get a chance to go, but I am a big fan of Chiptunes.
8651960	8658480	It's basically like the music that you guys play at the end of the show.
8658480	8664080	I don't know if you heard the shows we did live at Penny Arcade Expo, but I wonder if
8664080	8665080	Bobby's listening.
8665080	8668340	He'll say it in chat, but there was a guy that actually came on who did Chiptunes with
8668340	8671760	his old-school brick Game Boy, and he was pretty rad.
8671760	8673040	I think he came in...
8673040	8675160	And he was playing them actually...
8675160	8677320	It wouldn't have been the last day, because we weren't there the last day, because of
8677320	8678320	our flight.
8678320	8679320	It was the second day.
8679320	8681540	So look for day two of the PAX podcast.
8681540	8682600	We did it all games.
8682600	8686160	And towards the end of the shows, when the guy came on, he was pretty awesome.
8686160	8687760	Did you get his name or something like that?
8687760	8690160	I don't remember it off the top of my head, sadly.
8690160	8693120	I know we had it at the time, and I apologize if Bobby's listening.
8693120	8694120	He'll remember.
8694120	8695120	Okay.
8695120	8701600	Yeah, a lot of the performers on stage were actually meeting, and with Game Boys, there
8701600	8708220	was one artist that I think his name was Nordliff, or N-R-U-S-K, actually had two Game Boys and
8708220	8714200	basically switching back and forth through a mixer.
8714200	8717400	You had another group I saw on Sunday called Starscream.
8717400	8721440	Pretty much what they were doing was, you had one person on the Game Boy and another
8721440	8725360	person on drums.
8725360	8728720	It was just like a non-stop dance party or what?
8728720	8729720	Something like that.
8729720	8737840	It turned into like this awesome eight-pick electro rave, and there was a lot of crowd
8737840	8738840	surfing.
8738840	8739840	It was just great.
8739840	8744360	It ran an hour late, but it was well worth it, because my favorite group was on stage,
8744360	8745360	Onamanaguchi.
8745360	8752200	Basically, their background beats is eight-pick, N-E-S, and you have one on drums, a lead,
8752200	8754680	a bassist, and another guitarist.
8754680	8756600	I just can't remember what his part was.
8756600	8759720	Okay, I actually found it.
8759720	8763100	Of course, somebody in chat says it right, as I find it myself, but his name was Paul
8763100	8766320	Owens, and he's the director of the movie Reformat the Planet.
8766320	8768680	Oh, okay, that artist wasn't there.
8768680	8769680	Okay.
8769680	8773760	Anyway, sorry, when you said chiptunes, I just remembered that particular performance
8773760	8774760	was pretty awesome.
8774760	8776680	But I know what you're talking about.
8776680	8780840	This is kind of a big part of how 8-Bit Weapon kind of got their sound, you know?
8780840	8781840	Definitely.
8781840	8783720	I love 8-Bit Weapon.
8783720	8785000	So that's cool.
8785000	8787880	It's funny that this stuff's gotten bigger and bigger.
8787880	8788880	Definitely.
8788880	8794400	Now, from what I saw on Sunday, I would recommend these artists to check out.
8794400	8800840	Starscream, Syphus, Nordloaf, and Onomatoguchi, and USK.
8800840	8802560	Those are my five favorites.
8802560	8807600	If you have a nostalgic 80s feel to you, Trash 80 is really good.
8807600	8809600	How much did this whole thing cost you?
8809600	8812040	Actually, it was $15.
8812040	8814640	It was a four-night event.
8814640	8816600	It's $50 for all four nights.
8816600	8821200	If you paid $60, you get a DVD of Blitz Festival 06.
8821200	8822560	I just went for Sunday.
8822560	8825600	And I just picked up 07 DVD.
8825600	8830080	And I will tell you this, the way they remixed the music on that DVD, even if you have it
8830080	8834920	defined almost near where no one can still hear it, it's still loud, and it's really
8834920	8835920	good.
8835920	8836920	All right.
8836920	8837920	Well, it sounds like you had fun.
8837920	8839840	I wish our phone lines had been open last week.
8839840	8840840	Yeah.
8840840	8846160	And half the fun was just the visuals, I mean, the guys on stage, you saw, like, flashbacks
8846160	8848540	of 8-Bit gaming and everything.
8848540	8852440	I got to get the pictures up soon, but I did catch one screenshot of the samurai show that
8852440	8855420	went out on battle screen.
8855420	8857880	Wake me up when they have Guardian Legend.
8857880	8859800	I didn't see any Guardian Legend.
8859800	8861080	I'm just saying.
8861080	8862080	I know.
8862080	8863080	I know how much you love it.
8863080	8864080	You know.
8864080	8865080	It's not just me.
8865080	8866080	Dark Sakura, too.
8866080	8867080	Yep.
8867080	8870600	I think Loki has a soft spot for it, too, maybe not as strong.
8870600	8874000	The Force is not strong with him, but, you know, a little bit.
8874000	8875000	All right.
8875000	8878000	I'm staring at that screen, and happy fangirl is...
8878000	8879000	We'll get to it.
8879000	8880000	We'll get to it after the show.
8880000	8882200	Sorry, we got Tatsunoko vs. Capcom up on the screen now.
8882200	8883200	Finally.
8883200	8884200	We're going to get to it soon.
8884200	8885200	Rama, we've got to let you go.
8885200	8886200	We've got to let you go.
8886200	8887200	We've got one more call.
8887200	8888200	All right.
8888200	8889200	Can I say one more thing and I can get out of here?
8889200	8890200	Of course.
8890200	8891760	Jamie, that song, it's Pitch Black.
8891760	8896200	It's off the MC Frontline album Secrets from the Future, so you know which one it is.
8896200	8897200	Okay.
8897200	8898200	Cool.
8898200	8899200	Awesome.
8899200	8900200	Got it.
8900200	8901200	All righty.
8901200	8904880	Actually, did you get a chance to check out the new album?
8904880	8907560	I think it's in my roommate's car, but I'll have to check it out soon.
8907560	8908560	Very much worth it.
8908560	8909560	Definitely.
8909560	8910560	All right.
8910560	8911560	Bye, Rama.
8911560	8912560	Bye.
8912560	8913800	We'll take one more call.
8913800	8914800	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8914800	8920600	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call right now.
8920600	8921600	Any other last minute stories?
8921600	8922600	Did we get them all?
8922600	8923600	No, we didn't.
8923600	8924600	All right.
8924600	8925600	Go ahead.
8925600	8926600	It's music news stuff.
8926600	8928920	Pearl Jam's 10 album is coming to Rock Band in March.
8928920	8932440	That was announced at the Spike VGA.
8932440	8941800	They want me smoking last night.
8941800	8943800	Spoken.
8943800	8949200	And then Guitar Hero Metallica, there's some stuff coming out about it, including that
8949200	8957280	it's going to have a new, more difficult Expert Plus drum setting.
8957280	8961200	And apparently you're also going to be able to get some new Metallica drum sounds for
8961200	8962800	your drum fills and stuff like that.
8962800	8965000	Hurry for my broken drum set.
8965000	8966000	And?
8966000	8967000	Yeah.
8967000	8968000	Sorry, I picked up our caller.
8968000	8969000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8969000	8970000	Who's this?
8970000	8971000	This is Akiripur.
8971000	8972000	Hey, Akiripur.
8972000	8973000	What's on your mind?
8973000	8974000	I'm, well, what is it?
8974000	8984080	I'm, as you haven't heard, I'm back in WoW playing on the US server once again, actually.
8984080	8985080	Congratulations.
8985080	8987080	Oh, well.
8987080	8998800	Well, Andrew, I thought you were going to go up to us, that you can now change your,
8998800	9001440	totally re-customize your character in WoW.
9001440	9002440	Yes.
9002440	9003440	That's right.
9003440	9006160	There was some new news.
9006160	9008600	There was some new news that came out this week, is that now you can totally go back
9008600	9010000	and re-customize your character.
9010000	9014080	You were able to before, after the patch, you could do the hair.
9014080	9016320	And you could change some of the facial features that way.
9016320	9021040	But now, you can go in for a total makeover, which is where you can change everything about
9021040	9022940	your character's looks, basically.
9022940	9025940	But you can't change the race, you can't change the class.
9025940	9029000	So if you're a Tauren druid, you have to stay a Tauren druid.
9029000	9031720	Or probably better, because they're the only ones that can be druids.
9031720	9036280	But a good example would be something like, if you are a undead warlock, you can't switch
9036280	9040120	to, you know, like a troll warlock or something, you've got to stay undead.
9040120	9041120	Troll warlock.
9041120	9042760	The interesting, oh, whatever.
9042760	9048240	The interesting thing is, is that, I don't play a warlock, obviously.
9048240	9051760	The other interesting thing is, is that you can change the gender of your character, so
9051760	9053840	you can now give your character a sex change!
9053840	9054840	Whee!
9054840	9055840	Yay.
9055840	9061640	And, well, here's the other thing, is that, well, as one sort of, well, I don't know if
9061640	9068880	you're supposed to be, but as one cross-dresser sort of like, since I'm not considered myself
9068880	9070920	fully lone fanny.
9070920	9074520	I would say, but, that doesn't matter!
9074520	9077480	We already play as girls already!
9077480	9083280	Yeah, my character, I play as a Tauren female, because who plays a Tauren female?
9083280	9085600	I'll tell you, nobody plays a Tauren female.
9085600	9086600	You do.
9086600	9087600	Yeah, me.
9087600	9089000	And there's probably like five on the entire server.
9089000	9090480	In his sassy pants?
9090480	9091480	Yes.
9091480	9093480	I usually don't give out the character name of the server.
9093480	9094480	Sorry.
9094480	9095480	Yeah, no, that's fine.
9095480	9096480	Sorry.
9096480	9098160	I don't want random tells, nah, they're probably fine.
9098160	9099160	It's alright, I don't care.
9099160	9103280	But yeah, I just don't need the random emails of people saying, I looked up your character
9103280	9108840	in the armoury, and she sucks, because that'd tell them exactly what they could do.
9108840	9110840	But anyway, sorry.
9110840	9118760	I'm making a process of levelling up, speaking of warlocks, a warlock, and I get to level
9118760	9119760	30.
9119760	9126480	It's damn, it's damn, I could say it's damn nice that you get your amount at level 30
9126480	9127480	nowadays.
9127480	9128480	Oh, it's amazing.
9128480	9130240	They made a lot of great changes.
9130240	9133640	One change I really like that they did is that now you have the heirlooms.
9133640	9137920	So if you have a level 80 character, and if you save up your badges or winter grass marks,
9137920	9141880	you can buy these heirlooms, and you can send them, they're bind to account, meaning you
9141880	9146760	can send these items to any player on your account, and they actually scale in level.
9146760	9150840	And what's cool is that the shoulders heirlooms that you can buy scale in level, so you can
9150840	9155520	send them to your level one character, and they get a 10% experience bonus gain in addition
9155520	9157300	to the pretty awesome stats.
9157300	9162760	So kind of neat.
9162760	9163760	That seems quite nice.
9163760	9164760	Oh well.
9164760	9170880	Well, other than that, well, I have nothing to remark about, apart from like, yeah, I
9170880	9173760	should say, point out, check out Left 4 Dead.
9173760	9177280	It's really nice.
9177280	9178280	Where's this?
9178280	9179280	What is this?
9179280	9180280	Left 4 Dead.
9180280	9184400	Oh, Left 4 Dead, oh, yeah, yeah.
9184400	9190040	When the demo was released, I got up to plate, so.
9190040	9193080	But it really is something.
9193080	9201240	The only thing you have to point out is that you really do need four people and mics, and
9201240	9207200	all of them need to have mics, else there really isn't any fun.
9207200	9214160	All right, well, I gotta let you go, because the chat wants less Warcraft and more Tatsunoko
9214160	9216880	versus Capcom, so we're gonna wrap up the show.
9216880	9219120	Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that, too, so.
9219120	9221080	All right, well, take care, buddy.
9221080	9222080	Yeah, same.
9222080	9223080	Thank you for the call.
9223080	9225680	We enjoy hearing from our listeners from afar.
9225680	9228880	I do have commentary about Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
9228880	9229880	Which would be?
9229880	9236200	I like the music that they've put up for the characters, that for Ken, they give him the,
9236200	9241280	okay, gotcha on history, for the first 13 episodes of the series, it had a more sedate
9241280	9246000	opening, and the da-da-da theme that everyone knows was the closing theme, and then they
9246000	9249000	switched it over because all the fans liked the big one better.
9249000	9254280	So Ken gets that theme, but Jun gets the original opening, which I thought was pretty funny.
9254280	9261400	And that's it for me being a total Tatsunoko fangirl nerd.
9261400	9266200	And Dan laughed at me because I was singing along with it while I was playing the other
9266200	9268640	day.
9268640	9274920	All right, we're going to go around and give everybody's final thought and wrap up tonight's
9274920	9275920	show.
9275920	9276920	We're at the end of the show.
9276920	9277920	Oh, I'm sorry.
9277920	9278920	I didn't get it.
9278920	9279920	More last minute stories.
9279920	9280920	Sorry, yes, last minute stories.
9280920	9281920	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
9281920	9282920	No, that's all right.
9282920	9283920	Okay, back to Guitar Hero Metallica.
9283920	9286200	They have a partial track list out from it now.
9286200	9289480	On top of the Metallica songs, there's going to be some songs from other bands that worked
9289480	9291320	with Metallica and stuff like that.
9291320	9298320	Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Turn the Page, Judas Priest, Hell Bent for Leather,
9298320	9306040	Cyrus with Demon Cleaner, Lynyrd Skynyrd with Tuesdays Gone, Mastodon, Blood and Thunder,
9306040	9314240	looks like the Michael Sheckler group, Armed and Ready, Samhain, Mother of Mercy, and The
9314240	9316280	Sword, Black River.
9316280	9323000	And there's also apparently some unannounced tracks by Slayer, Queen, and the Foo Fighters.
9323000	9326800	I guess this is all coming from the new Game Informer.
9326800	9328720	It's going to have some info on that.
9328720	9333860	Also the Metallica tracks in there, Enter Sandman, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Fuel, Hit
9333860	9341600	the Lights, King Nothin', Master Puppets, and No Leaf Clovers, Nothing Else Matters,
9341600	9347640	Sad but True, The Unforgiven, and Where I May Roam, so that's kind of cool.
9347640	9354720	And let's see, some other stuff, download content coming to LittleBigPlanet, including
9354720	9361680	a Santa costume you can get now, it'll be available free on December 18th, and they're
9361680	9369920	going to have it in two parts, so you can make your Santa sack boys, and I downloaded
9369920	9370920	that by the way.
9370920	9374960	I haven't played LittleBigPlanet in a couple days, or actually a couple weeks, just because
9374960	9378580	I've been playing other stuff like Prince of Persia and stuff, but yeah.
9378580	9379580	And that's it.
9379580	9380580	Got it.
9380580	9384080	Alright, now we're going to go around and give everybody's final thought and get on
9384080	9388480	out of here so we can get to our post-show, and then the Tatsunoko Capcom stuff will be
9388480	9389480	fun.
9389480	9396400	Everybody's final thought, Dark Soccer, we'll start with you, what's your final thought?
9396400	9400080	They're the white shadow.
9400080	9402080	Because if you know Gachamon.
9402080	9403080	I don't.
9403080	9409280	Anyway, I forgot the whole stupid speech, so whatever.
9409280	9411720	More Gachamon, less wow.
9411720	9418640	My final thought is, wow, I love my new, I have a tanuki suit hoodie that I have now
9418640	9421680	that's awesome, I wore it out last night and I got compliments on it, but the best part
9421680	9425260	about it, on the actual hoodie, is little cat ears.
9425260	9428160	So you actually look like, I'll go out and get it.
9428160	9429160	Oh, never mind.
9429160	9434680	Yeah, I don't have it out right now, but I'll wear it out sometime when we go out to not
9434680	9438600	go to the test location of DJ Max Technica, because you know, you're like, I gotta go
9438600	9439600	shopping.
9439600	9442480	Let's get some shoes.
9442480	9443480	Let's get some shoes.
9443480	9444480	Loki, your final thought?
9444480	9447760	Uh, my final thought is I gotta find Cage Man's song.
