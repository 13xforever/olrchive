13985	15948	Tonight, December 14th, 2008.
16549	19414	Commodore 64 game returns to the Nintendo DS.
19614	21817	Nintendo faces yet another Wii lawsuit.
22198	23921	Could a Rez sequel be in the works?
32014	32795	DarkSakura Jamie Summers
48891	50912	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
71522	73705	Let us in in our snow, I mean rain.
74285	76568	Loki, Techmaster Loki is also joining us tonight.
76588	76969	How you doing?
77169	77389	Good.
77990	81634	As he does every week here for the past 305 some odd weeks.
81674	82656	That's where we're at tonight, episode 305.
82696	82836	Crazy.
82856	83116	Yeah, I think.
85478	86559	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
105579	108180	But you can't interact with the Video Game Awards.
108201	108741	That's the thing.
109001	112062	Do they even let people... I mean, I don't really follow it, so I don't know.
112323	116525	Do they actually let people vote on it, or is it picked by experts?
116845	117445	Possibly.
117565	118926	I think they may have, like, voting.
119546	120927	Maybe someone in our chat room knows.
121187	124649	For at least probably one category or something like that.
124669	126790	See, but here, they get to interact with us.
127150	129791	You know, the Video Game Awards doesn't let the audience interact with them, really.
130111	131332	So, except the hooping and hollering.
131572	132613	So, there you go.
133473	142717	Alright, well we're going to get started with the show tonight and we always like to start off with a little bit of how was your gaming week So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
144037	157983	I played Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and it was freaking fangasm-tastic And I played Raiden Fighters 2 at the Jaspers around the corner from your house and up the road I didn't know they had that, huh?
158163	158763	Hell yeah.
159064	159264	Nice.
159764	166068	And I played some Ragnarok, and I tried to play some Order of Ecclesia, but I was like, meh.
166629	176435	Now, Tetsunoko vs. Capcom, you've been very excited about this game for a while, so when you give this game a positive review, are you giving it a positive review because it's actually a good fighting game, or are you just giving it a positive review because it tickles your fan senses?
176836	177136	Both.
178517	179157	Seriously.
179197	180038	All right.
180518	186402	Especially since I can play as the almighty combo of Ken and June, I'm very, very happy.
187242	187943	So, yeah.
189056	190557	DarkTetsuya I think it's paid for ahead of time
211270	224837	Actdeft says some of the categories are user voted Amaze Satsuma says video game awards have no ferrets that's why I'm watching OLR or I guess you'd be listening to it because sadly our video camera is broken just to give you an update on JustinTV we're going to be off JustinTV until 2009
226038	227939	I was gonna say, I could bring in the PlayStation Eye, I think, has drivers.
249807	250367	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
265708	268209	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
293911	294993	Alright, how was your gaming week, Loki?
295614	296495	My gaming week was alright.
296796	300441	I played Animal Crossing and watched a lot of my wife playing Animal Crossing.
301362	306289	And, yeah, it's Animal Crossing and I don't know why I still play it, but whatever.
307691	308212	And then...
309233	312815	I played some more Mirror's Edge, and that's pretty fun.
313896	314636	Still very hard.
315536	317077	Does the demo give you a good sense of that game?
317097	322020	Because I actually tried playing the demo for that a little bit this week, and it was... It sort of does.
322080	327983	I mean, it gets a lot harder because I think a lot of it... Luckily, you can't really die.
328343	332205	You just keep falling off the building and respawning and starting again and stuff.
332625	337288	But there's a lot of parts in the game that I didn't know where I was supposed to go.
337768	338808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
358018	381510	The reason why I actually played some Earth Defense Force is because I had gotten some Christmas bonuses and I was thinking about buying an Import 360 to play Japanese games, but then I actually looked at what Japanese games come out over there that I would be interested in, and there's like three, and I'm like, no, not worth it.
381770	385172	But Earth Defense Force was one of those, and I was like, oh yeah, I forgot about Earth Defense Force.
385312	387693	Well, not really, but I had to play it some more.
388898	395505	Um, and then finally I played, um, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, and yes, it is an awesome game.
395926	406077	Um, it actually is a game that makes me excited about fighting games again, um, because it plays, I mean, I'm not really one to talk about fighting games because I don't play enough of them, and
406857	407818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
429434	429694	I don't know.
429895	431897	Okay, here's my question about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
431917	436003	Because from my perspective, I don't know much about the Tatsunoko universe.
436043	437866	What is it that makes this game so fun?
437886	441851	Because I'm kind of surprised that you guys are giving it such glowing reviews.
441871	444295	Because I kind of expected this game to just be like a...
445476	448960	Slap the characters on it and run with it type thing.
449480	450281	Instant cash cow.
450501	452843	But you guys both are enjoying this.
452883	453984	It's kind of surprising me.
454065	458349	For me, it's a little bit simpler to play because it doesn't have all the kick and punch buttons.
458389	462032	Now it's all just light, medium, heavy attack buttons.
462213	465456	And then you have one button to switch characters.
465916	466156	But...
467279	473768	It seems a lot easier for me to play, and then also, it just kind of feels like Marvel vs. Capcom, which I love that game.
474670	482641	Now, the characters, you know, I don't know who have to... I mean, I recognize some of them from the titles of their series and stuff, but, you know...
483602	485163	I don't know who any of them are.
485223	487064	I haven't watched the series and that kind of thing.
487104	488925	I mean, I just know a few of them.
489165	493707	And I do think that the character choices are a bit sparse because it's like one per game.
494307	495948	They have, you know, going there.
495968	500751	I mean, Street Fighter wise, you know, from Street Fighter 2, you have Ryu and Cheng Li and that's it.
501391	526809	and then for Street Fighter 3 they have like one character from that and one character from Darkstalkers so it's very very limited in that sense but I mean there are quite a few characters I think there's like 32 altogether or something like that but it just seems kind of sparse in that sense but it's just fun I don't know and just the presentation of it's really fluid it's really smooth it plays well on the Wii which is saying much um
528055	528996	That's pretty much why.
529176	530957	A comment from ShadowCharlie in chat.
531037	533379	What would make it more interesting is that it comes to the U.S.
533559	535060	Any hopes for this game coming to the U.S.?
535080	538743	No, it's not going to happen because of the licensing of the Tatsuno characters.
539624	551312	What I'd like to see is if they couldn't bring it over here, then do maybe another Marvel vs. Capcom or do Capcom vs. something else and use the same engine and just do new characters.
552473	553414	Reskin the characters?
553834	554734	Well, not necessarily.
554754	556495	Capcom vs. Mr. T?
556535	562158	Well, they're all 3D this time, which is kind of neat, because it's Marvel vs. Capcom, but it is 3D.
563899	568081	But it's like Street Fighter 4 3D, where it's 3D but 2D type thing.
570102	572923	So, I don't know, maybe pick another anime character.
573872	576434	All ADV and Pioneer are redistributors.
576454	579495	The thing is that none of these companies really have American licenses.
579515	580256	Then fine!
580276	580876	Disney vs. Capcom!
591519	592359	Yeah, that'd really happen.
592500	594901	Actdeft suggests Cartoon Network versus Capcom.
595241	595501	No.
595521	596762	That'd be retarded.
596822	603646	That would actually, though, be the closest thing we could actually get to some sort of animated series on TV.
604446	605486	Nickelodeon versus Capcom.
605507	607327	No, Warner Brothers versus Capcom.
607347	608648	Ooh, the Animaniacs would be awesome.
608668	610149	How about just Capcom versus Capcom?
610169	610529	Freakazoid.
611069	612850	Somebody said that in chat, just as I said that.
612890	613731	Capcom versus Capcom.
613751	615652	They already have that, actually.
616392	617533	I can't remember what it's called now.
617693	619234	No, actually, that was a game that was scrapped.
620333	624615	No, they had... It was a Capcom... It was a fighting game they even ported to the Xbox.
625075	629097	It was like a mega mix of characters from all these different Capcom games.
629117	630218	Oh, yeah.
630698	631819	I'm not sure how to pronounce this name.
632259	634720	Leo Shen, I think, or Leo Xen?
634740	635420	Probably Leo Shen.
635740	637601	Leo Shen says, your mom versus Capcom.
637941	638762	That's what Sauce said.
638782	639342	There you go.
641203	643724	All right, so it sounds like you guys have been having fun with this game one way or another.
644064	644565	It was all right.
644585	646746	I mean, it... Yeah, studio... Yeah, I...
649361	650021	It was alright.
650082	652803	It's just it's probably not going to come out over here, which is unfortunate.
652863	654964	But they could still use the engine for something else.
655004	656065	And that's what I think they should do.
657606	659867	Frisbee says, Capcom versus the world.
660387	665770	Well, they could do another like Street Fighter versus Capcom thing, but just make a sequel to that or something.
666270	667891	And then they can just use their own characters.
668471	671413	Yes, Capcom Fighting Evolution was the one I was thinking of.
672273	675115	Nando in chat says, Harpo Productions versus Capcom.
675135	675615	Can you imagine that?
675715	676796	Oprah versus Capcom.
679656	683159	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
702164	724905	Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC and it's still it's weird because I tried upgrading the RAM on my PC to 4 gigs even though Windows can only see like 2 of it but I was going to do it anyways and I had a bad run with bad RAM from Fry's apparently Fry's they keep taking back my defective RAM as just a stock return and so they have like 4 that they keep swapping out
725626	726486	Even though it's defective.
726606	734229	So I stopped buying RAM there because it's pointless and it would have been too much of a pain in the ass to see it on my computer.
735049	746113	So that being said, I haven't really been playing too much of Grand Theft Auto 4 since it's still kind of buggy even though they patched it a little bit to fix some stuff.
746153	746793	It's not enough.
746853	753235	It doesn't support SLI yet and that kind of pisses me off because I spent the money for an extra video card.
753255	754876	I want the games to fucking see it.
756112	758052	And I mean, come on, it's like a standard nowadays.
759193	759853	It's just lazy.
760533	761533	Damn lazy is what it is.
762674	765494	Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, then my gaming week.
766274	767835	Kind of a lot of the same usual stuff.
767935	770155	I've obviously been playing a lot of The Wrath of the Lich King.
770555	773796	I have done a big, big thing in WoW this week.
773876	780238	I respect, for a long-term basis, because we're so short on healers, just on the server in general, not just our guild, but the server.
780638	781958	I'm no longer a boomkin.
782478	784279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
805595	806516	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
827587	828688	I checked out Meteos Wars.
828708	832249	I only checked out the demo, so I don't want to really review a full game based strictly off the demo.
833110	835191	Graphics were a little minimalist in the stage I played.
835231	837752	However, it's a fairly faithful translation.
838192	844515	I was wondering how you would have the speed of the stylus in a game like Meteos Wars, but the way they did it was kind of neat.
845215	852018	Instead of sliding the pieces up and down, you use triangle to move a piece up a row really fast, and you use, what, X?
852138	853539	I'm sorry, triangles would be a PlayStation.
853559	853879	I'm sorry, X.
854520	854781	Why?
855101	855322	Why?
863717	864277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
887173	888514	I don't know what you'd really call that.
911530	912330	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
929653	930713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
952818	956741	I grew up in a day where it was all 2D.
956821	960404	Mario Bros., Super Mario World, and all this, and even the old school Prince of Persia is 2D.
960785	963427	It's taken me a long time to really get used to 3D.
963607	965809	I even still have problems with Mario 64, okay?
966289	974856	But the thing I like about Prince of Persia is that they've done things in this game that make it really accessible to noobs, because the game really holds your hand for a long time.
975676	1002126	and what I also like about it is that even if you fall off a cliff, you don't really die you have the chick as a crutch to kind of save you and I think a lot of hardcore gamers have been really turned off by that but for me, I've kind of appreciated it and it's kind of made me want to continue to play because I don't lose massive amounts of time because I don't know how to turn the freaking camera and that's what Tigerclaw says Sky, what about the fact that you cannot die in the game?
1003223	1004864	Thank you for watching!
1019971	1020691	and I don't know.
1021532	1023753	Progress still feels a lot like challenge to me.
1024093	1027714	You have to collect things and you don't have to collect everything.
1027734	1034017	You get light seeds and you don't have to collect them all to progress to new areas but you get a sense of accomplishment for collecting them all.
1034037	1036938	So they've done other little things with it.
1038965	1041267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1061914	1064957	Achievements are really, really easy, though, too, I noticed.
1065097	1066858	At least, or the trophies or whatever.
1066918	1069360	I noticed I unlocked a silver trophy real easy.
1070041	1071322	I didn't have to do hardly anything.
1071402	1072903	So, kind of interesting.
1074464	1076946	So, that was pretty much it for new games I played this week.
1078047	1081770	I'm hoping I'll probably actually play Prince of Persia a lot more, try to play it through to completion.
1081990	1083412	They thought it was a Final Fantasy game.
1083852	1086754	And I'm like, no, there's no, you know.
1087375	1089937	I was going to ask you, did you try out Home?
1091462	1092123	Did I try what?
1092343	1092583	Home.
1101303	1113350	You know, home is one of those things that I think it was a really great idea, but this execution that we're seeing of it is kind of not that great.
1113771	1114291	You know what I mean?
1114871	1122496	Like, God, if you think Xbox Live is bad, the minute I logged into home, I just started hearing every naughty word in the book.
1122816	1125218	You know, just everything you'd hear on Xbox Live.
1125478	1130241	Like, I didn't even know that you could use microphones on Sony Home, but apparently you can.
1131142	1131949	So, yeah.
1132897	1132978	Um...
1135458	1143561	I don't know, yeah, you know, it's like, and again, it was also one of those things where it kind of caused, you know, the non-game playing people who come through this house to kind of look at the TV and go, what is this?
1143621	1144402	This looks kind of neat.
1144722	1150124	Like, they were watching me in the bowling alley, like, and you know, all the stuff in the bowling alley is really stupid.
1150144	1155686	Like, I tried playing one of the games in there, which was basically an overdone version of Breakout, you know, like just a redone version of that.
1156647	1158127	But it's all free, you have to remember.
1158207	1163849	So you can't expect that it's going to be anything that great, because they're going to nickel and dime you, like they're trying to do with the costumes and everything.
1165563	1171024	This all being said, I do think there's potential here for something cool.
1171544	1174945	I think there is networking potential within home.
1175725	1182327	I'm kind of excited for the clubhouses to come out because I would like for us to have an OLR clubhouse where we could boot idiots and things like that.
1182347	1183867	I think we could have a lot of fun with it.
1185007	1185687	Here's my thing.
1186628	1187208	Right now, it's...
1188536	1190737	It's just this clusterfuck of strangeness.
1191057	1192278	I mean, honestly, it's what it is.
1192518	1193359	I don't know how else to explain it.
1193379	1200802	Do you think it's fair for them to be advertising this as a feature of the PlayStation 3 since it is only in beta right now?
1201143	1204604	I mean, they've been having it in commercials since, what, last year?
1205325	1206766	I mean, I think that's kind of unfair.
1208906	1213547	I will answer that question, but let me address this because I got a private message.
1213607	1214247	What is home?
1214487	1218628	For those of us that aren't as familiar with this, basically home is like a virtual world.
1218828	1224249	These types of things were especially big back in the late 90s and then kind of caught a second wind with Second Life.
1224549	1231550	But when the whole virtual reality thing first came out, they used to have these chat programs where you could be like a little virtual avatar and you walk around a virtual world.
1231810	1234951	And then Second Life kind of really took that to the next level on the PCs.
1235391	1240116	Well, this is kind of Sony's version of Second Life where you create a little version of yourself.
1240136	1242799	You know, you can think of me, I guess, but it's a lot more realistic.
1243139	1251768	And you literally, using your controllers, walk around an open area where there's other people dancing or talking or interacting with each other.
1252028	1258054	But then you can go into like a bowling alley and you can walk up to a bowling machine if they're not all full, which they usually are.
1258447	1261429	and play bowling with other people and interact with them that way.
1261709	1263090	Or you could walk up to an arcade machine.
1263110	1266371	So it's kind of like, you know, it's like a virtual life.
1266972	1269353	So it's kind of like a game, but it's not.
1269373	1271214	I don't know if that makes any sense at all.
1271554	1274636	It's their idea to try a new networking thing.
1277718	1280019	VXChaseNextV in chat says, Second life is a construct.
1280059	1280940	Home is a construct.
1281600	1282681	Alright, so now what was your question?
1283021	1284362	Home, is it fair to advertise it?
1284922	1285062	Yeah.
1285082	1285162	Yeah.
1286509	1289731	It's obvious that Sony wanted to do a lot more with this.
1289811	1290872	It's not implemented yet.
1290912	1293013	I'm not sure what's taken them so long.
1293474	1299037	But maybe it's just like, again, it's one of those things where the ideas are coming faster than the reality of being able to program it in.
1299217	1302139	I mean, technically, yeah, they can advertise it.
1302759	1306822	I would equate it to when they advertise video games with nothing but the cutscenes from the game.
1307785	1308666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1331363	1331963	No, I don't.
1332424	1332924	It's in beta.
1332944	1335606	It's not even done.
1335666	1336987	Isn't Gmail still in beta?
1337668	1338789	Yeah, but it's functional.
1339129	1342652	I would say it's close to being functional, but it's not.
1343652	1351619	It'd be like putting out a demo of a game or something like that and then advertising that in a commercial for the PlayStation or something like that.
1351659	1353400	Like, play Killzone 2.
1353720	1354801	Oh, except it's not out.
1354821	1356582	It's just a demo or something like that.
1357583	1358884	I don't know, it's a little misleading.
1358984	1366068	Not that anyone really gives a crap about their commercials, since I think the sales numbers speak for themselves, so whatever.
1366589	1367930	I just think it's kind of misleading.
1368150	1371952	I think there's potential in Home, but it has yet to be unlocked.
1372212	1376355	Also, the only other thing I want to say about Home is that it's a little confusing.
1376515	1380718	I mean, the things about the Xbox, especially the Nintendo one...
1381358	1389981	Those are very easy to just kind of pop into and go, and obviously neither system has done something as ambitious as Home, but Home's kind of complicated.
1390121	1396243	Like, it took me a minute to really kind of work through the menus and everything, and it really is, it's even more tough when not everything's available yet.
1396563	1398504	That's the other kind of bummer about it.
1399585	1402446	And Jason wants to correct that Gmail is no longer in beta.
1403066	1404046	Gmail is official.
1404106	1405747	Gmail Labs is beta add-ons.
1406107	1406527	So there you go.
1409283	1410484	Interesting comments from chat.
1410584	1413825	SSJ100Matt says, it's like calling Windows 3.1.1 a game.
1414906	1415646	Yeah, I know.
1415726	1417007	Home isn't really a game.
1417427	1420668	It's like folding at home is not really a game either.
1420688	1421388	It's a simulation.
1422129	1423229	Yeah, it's a thing.
1425610	1427011	No, I guess you could say it's a simulation.
1427811	1428091	I don't know.
1429952	1435393	All right, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping real quick, of which we don't have a whole lot of tonight.
1435454	1439775	Just, you know, always check us out on MySpace at Orange Launch Radio or Facebook at the OL Army.
1440115	1441255	Our Twitter is OLR.
1441775	1446977	We're also on LiveJournal, Community Orange Lounge, and we always try to keep you up to date on the latest and greatest.
1447417	1453718	Although, it's been kind of a busy past few months, so a lot of our internet presence has really slowed down, so sorry about that.
1453758	1458960	But we're still trying to keep it going with the show and do what we always do, and hopefully 2009 will be a little better.
1460420	1461281	Maybe it'll be warmer.
1461981	1470683	Oh, also, one thing you gotta see in home is that when you go into the theater, you just get to see an extended Twilight trailer playing on the screen over and over and over again.
1471983	1476165	I haven't seen it, nor probably will I. It's very Mystery Science 3000-able.
1478065	1479065	That would be funny.
1480066	1482106	That's the type of stuff they should be using home for.
1482386	1484127	See, that's why I say there's potential there.
1484527	1486748	That doesn't necessarily mean Sony's gonna ever unlock it.
1486908	1487468	I'm just saying.
1487648	1488208	There's potential.
1489875	1490075	All right.
1490235	1490476	All right.
1492077	1493438	Let's get into some gaming news, Loki.
1493658	1494239	Start us off.
1494679	1494959	Yes.
1495560	1505148	Speaking of Sony, Sony has been seeing some hard times, and they're actually cutting plants and with that slashing 8,000 jobs.
1505508	1518619	This is all supposed to happen between now and April of 2010, and Sony will cut about 5% of their electronics divisions and close a tenth of its manufacturing sites.
1520316	1522197	It's not good, especially in this tough economy.
1523418	1526239	That's kind of sad.
1526580	1530202	Is it just because PS3s haven't been selling well?
1530342	1534004	Or is it that now they don't need these people because the PS3 is already out?
1534584	1536185	I think it's just because they haven't been selling well.
1536645	1541888	There's no need to have these extra plants producing more systems if they're not selling out.
1541948	1544010	They're not having an issue with selling out at all.
1546031	1546291	Although,
1547042	1552186	They are at times hard to find just because they keep phasing out SKUs left and right.
1552887	1554288	I mean, crap.
1554328	1559092	This year alone there's been four different SKUs for the PS3.
1559252	1561734	I mean, that's kind of crazy right there.
1562615	1566718	Well, that's four new SKUs and that's not even including the ones that we came in this year with.
1568420	1568720	I don't know.
1570688	1573869	This is kind of related, but it kind of goes back to what we were talking about with Home.
1574169	1575750	I really want to read this comment because it's interesting.
1576010	1577451	Frisbee says in chat,
1587674	1588394	That's kind of strange.
1588414	1588815	It's neat.
1588855	1591896	But see, that's kind of cool with the whole BD Live thing.
1591936	1592216	So, I mean...
1604662	1605483	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1623749	1625770	Wow, what an interesting movie.
1627291	1629493	That's really the only word I can use to describe it as interesting.
1629513	1631194	Certain people are kind of dicks.
1631254	1632935	The drama is still playing out.
1633255	1634196	Here's the thing, though.
1636757	1638819	God, how far do I want to get into this on the show?
1639099	1642401	Especially when we were just talking about something completely different, and I apologize.
1642581	1647605	Because it's very sad that people lost their jobs, but unfortunately we don't know much more than that at this time about it.
1647645	1649025	So here we are on this whole other subject.
1649686	1649766	Okay.
1651035	1657338	You gotta kind of wonder, like with this movie, how biased is it trying to be?
1657378	1665082	And I'm not trying to say that Billy Mitchell is not likely the pompous ass he made himself to be in the movie, but I don't know.
1665102	1666463	There's something about it.
1666543	1672986	Something about the fact that they had all these cameras in just the right places at just the right times when all these things were going on.
1673406	1677268	There's something about it that says there's some type of...
1679821	1681643	Editing stuff going on here.
1681723	1682003	I don't know.
1682023	1696214	But then at the same time, I know a lot of our folks listen to the other shows on All Games and you've probably heard all this crap about the Twin Galaxies and Mr. Awesome's been on All Games off and on throughout the years and all this crap going on with Twin Galaxies.
1696914	1702258	It just kind of goes to show you this drama has been going on for years and is continuing even still today.
1702579	1706302	Not just with Donkey Kong, but with the official scores in general.
1706882	1707563	And it's just kind of...
1708223	1709285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1725427	1736335	I'm like, he's like, well, not the Steve Wiebe guy that seems, you know, pretty cool or whatever, and his family's pretty funny, but most of the people in the movie are very sad individuals, like Billy and his lackeys and, you know, all that stuff.
1736355	1746163	And I'm kind of like, well... But Billy Mitchell actually owns his own business and, you know, makes his... I'm saying he's still an ass, but, you know, but he's a successful businessman.
1747335	1749057	The King of Kong was a very good movie.
1764150	1765731	He sent the tape in and all this stuff.
1766631	1768892	They have a camera at his house when he sends in the tape.
1768932	1769932	They have a camera there.
1770212	1771732	They have a camera with Grandma at the airport.
1771772	1774893	I'm kind of like, this seems all way too pre-planned for me.
1774933	1777014	That was the only problem I had with the movie.
1777474	1780195	This documentary was really well done.
1783136	1785057	Like, almost too well done.
1785377	1785697	I don't know.
1785857	1786397	It was weird.
1786977	1788578	Well, I also didn't see him as being...
1790632	1797798	Very, uh, excuse me, being rather pompous enough to want to tape everything.
1798258	1802461	But here's the thing, here's what I was going to say, and this is what I was kind of going to tell my roommate about too.
1802942	1805824	You see these kind of pompous asses in lots of sports.
1806324	1811148	Like, you ever watch some of these football press conferences or wrestling or boxing?
1811648	1816532	I mean, some of us cheer on these pompous assholes in wrestling, you know what I mean?
1816552	1816632	Yeah.
1817053	1821900	So, in a way, I don't hate the guy.
1821940	1827109	He did come off like a pompous ass in the movie, but maybe there's more to him than that.
1827770	1828050	I don't know.
1828130	1828832	Just interesting.
1829553	1829693	Yeah.
1833277	1861922	and then you look at some of these side stories going on like the whole Mr. Awesome Missile Command I never realized and keep in mind I've been watching this whole thing play out on all games I never realized that he had the direct impact on that movie by sending the guy the Donkey Kong board that he did and just to kind of see like literally I was just kind of like wow a lot of this makes sense now what I've been hearing on all games like damn these people and their drama overscores but I don't know
1862998	1863819	All they've got.
1865281	1865842	I know, I know.
1865862	1867624	I don't fault them for it.
1867644	1868946	I don't think they're sad people.
1869246	1870869	It's what they're into.
1871049	1873752	I think it's just... I don't know.
1873772	1874734	It hurts my head to think about it.
1875566	1878968	It almost makes you wonder, it's like, okay, so say you have it.
1879488	1881409	And you know who I blame even more to?
1881769	1884810	It's the fucking Guinness Book of World Records, because they're not helping things.
1885391	1888852	Now putting out this stupid gaming book and stuff, they're just egging it on.
1889132	1897936	And not only that, but they have stupid records in there, like people that claim to have the highest score in DDR, a game that I don't think you can have a high score in.
1898817	1899077	It's just...
1900109	1901169	I don't know, so subjective
1928899	1928999	Okay.
1929059	1929159	Sure.
1950998	1968325	and you know I understand you know I understand why people get all into it because like you know I think one guy who was like a friend of Steve Levy or something said it said it best in the movie this guy my friend Steve is the best in the world at something in the entire world and true it might be Donkey Kong but he's the best in the world
1970045	1971806	I can see why people get so passionate over that.
1971826	1973287	Did you see him play through the kill screen?
1973687	1973887	Yeah.
1974187	1975368	That was pretty sweet.
1976048	1977529	I've seen a kill screen once.
1978629	1978809	Once.
1979950	1981170	And I was little.
1984332	1985012	Alright, anyhow.
1985272	1985512	Sorry.
1986013	1989034	A total tangent that took up more time than the... It's a cool tangent.
1989514	1990835	It's gaming and not food.
1990875	1991935	Much sadder story.
1992095	1993636	Speaking of food though, I ate at Olive Garden today.
1994329	1995410	Home of the NeverEnding Breadsticks.
1995750	1997371	I'm sorry I didn't invite you, Jamie.
1997411	2000093	It was a last minute thing.
2000353	2002235	But that's the first time I've had it since the surgery.
2002255	2003876	Anyway, sorry.
2004396	2007719	Bad tangent, especially following a story about such horrible layoffs as Sony.
2007779	2010361	But unfortunately, we don't have a lot more to tell you there.
2011321	2016724	All right, let's talk about sales, and maybe this might help explain kind of the Sony layoffs and so on.
2017004	2020646	Some of the November numbers from MPD are in, talking about the sales.
2020846	2026708	And the Wii in November sold 2.04 million units, probably no one's surprised.
2026748	2028629	The DS in second place, 1.57 million units.
2028669	2028950	Xbox 360, 836K.
2034997	2063924	PSP 421k PS3 378k Playstation 2 is finally in last place 206k so this might finally be the PS2 kind of walking out the door here but it's kind of strange that the PS3 you know is the PS2 is definitely on it's way out it's not I'd say maybe by the end of next year because I mean looking just at what the releases are like for example in February
2064824	2067989	There are three games coming out for the PS2, and that is it.
2069191	2072697	In January, I think two or three also coming out.
2073919	2075581	It's getting a lot less...
2077773	2079874	FloatwalkinChat says people buy PSP still?
2099765	2108948	Yeah, because it isn't just a game system, but it's the whole movies and internet and MP3s in your pocket.
2110028	2111228	But they are released.
2111728	2115189	Sadly enough, a lot of the publishers are just not making PSP games anymore.
2115969	2120331	The amount of games coming out is really sad, and it's not a good sign.
2120511	2121891	Why do you think everyone jumped ship suddenly?
2122011	2123332	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2144250	2149032	I can't imagine Zahar the program for it, but they don't sell very well.
2149072	2150632	Their versions aren't very good.
2151273	2152893	They don't have the install base for it.
2153733	2155734	People are playing DSs more.
2157175	2160576	There's a lot of good PSP games, it's just... I don't know.
2161724	2162184	Thanks for watching!
2182827	2193376	You know, I wonder if the Final Fantasy VII remake that people always have big boners talking about on the PlayStation 3, like, you know, big fangasm, you know, talking about they want it to happen on PlayStation 3, I wonder if they wouldn't do something like that for PSP.
2195177	2196358	I wouldn't think it'd be very good.
2196559	2201203	They could bring the, like, Final Fantasy VII, maybe redo some of the graphics a little bit, and...
2202318	2203659	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2227720	2233862	which, you know, kind of contradicts that story we had a couple weeks ago that wasn't selling very well because it was the 10th best-selling game in November.
2234922	2242724	Maybe it didn't hit the millions and millions expectations, but the 10th best-selling game out of everything that's out there, that's not that bad.
2243384	2243744	No.
2244004	2250786	Well, and then also I think the last report we saw for the MPD numbers, it was only out for like a week, so...
2251974	2252594	DarkSakura.com
2269040	2269420	I don't know.
2269500	2273103	I can probably have explanations for most of these.
2274024	2279108	Number 9 was Resistance 2 on the PlayStation 3, which is PS3's one of their big titles.
2280269	2282351	Number 8 was Left 4 Dead on the Xbox 360.
2282431	2283392	I really need to pick that game up.
2283412	2286635	That game's been performing above expectations, right?
2287556	2287716	Yeah.
2288136	2290658	Number 7 was Guitar Hero World Tour on the Wii.
2292380	2295442	Call of Duty World of War on the PS3 Mario Kart on the Wii
2315596	2316617	Number four, Wii Fit.
2316918	2319200	Also another thing that's very short and hard to find.
2320101	2322463	Number three, Wii Play with the remote.
2322763	2325606	If people just sell that like a remote, hey, you get a $10 game.
2326727	2328989	Then that's got to be why this game is still topping the charts.
2330711	2331372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2347189	2347730	It's got to be it.
2348230	2350951	Number two, Call of Duty World of War, the 360 version.
2351932	2355133	And then number one would be Gears of War 2 on the Xbox 360.
2355454	2361857	But I should point out, if you add up the two Call of Duty World of Wars across 360 and PS3, that would be number one, not Gears of War 2.
2362637	2367360	But Gears of War 2 being Xbox 360 exclusive only has the one system to consider.
2368140	2371542	So, just an interesting list.
2371622	2373143	There you go.
2373463	2374704	Your November NPD numbers.
2375609	2382971	Well, for people like me who have an iPhone, there is some fun out there, although I've been hearing mixed reviews on it.
2383891	2388633	There is I Love Katamari, which is actually I Love Katamari on the iPhone.
2389153	2394174	It's $7.99, and you can either play it on the iPhone or the iPod Touch.
2395154	2400336	And it's 82 meg, has a story, time attack, eternal and exact size.
2401517	2409610	and it apparently suffers really bad from the iPhone's poor frame rate for games but I figured I might download it eventually.
2411148	2413411	The last game I actually paid for was Pole Position.
2413791	2419757	I was going to check it out, but then I read the reviews, and they all were bitching about the frame rate, and I was like, okay, maybe this isn't so cool.
2419777	2421399	Yeah, but that's just iPhone games anyway.
2421839	2427705	You look at any review on an iPhone game, they're going to talk about the frame rate unless it's something, you know, dinky like Pac-Man.
2427926	2430488	Or Labyrinth, which is what I play all the time.
2430788	2431669	It doesn't matter, though.
2431689	2432750	I mean, I don't think...
2433837	2435978	That's like bitching about the framerate on any system.
2436358	2440440	I can't see that that's a reason to even put out a game.
2440480	2442641	Then, oh, I can't get the framerate up where I need to be.
2442741	2444021	Well, then you can't release the game.
2444182	2446463	That means you can't get it up.
2447083	2449964	You have to make some sort of missions for...
2452932	2465717	I don't know whether it be like you just use cell shading, really flat textures so that the size of the textures isn't really big and so it's able to render it faster, or I don't know.
2465737	2475480	They're trying to push the iPhone as this big gaming platform, and yeah, unfortunately to me that's almost like pushing the N-Gage as a big gaming platform.
2475500	2477041	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2478261	2483404	First of all, games look a bajillion times better on the iPhone than they did on the N-Gage.
2483764	2485706	And I had a great gaming taco.
2485866	2486726	I understand this.
2488007	2498653	On top of that, there's so much more functionality with the iPhone that comparing it to that waste of electronics that was the N-Gage is seriously like comparing...
2501164	2510507	I would have to say a Blackberry with one of those old car phones that you had to attach to your cigarette lighter and was the size of your head.
2511408	2511968	Here's my thing.
2514569	2516850	They're trying to be a gaming platform.
2516870	2517890	That's what they keep saying.
2518290	2520991	They're one of the best gaming platforms out there.
2521091	2524213	I don't know how they can claim that, but they are.
2527772	2540741	It's funny, if Nintendo had almost taken the same idea and just done almost like what XNA is doing and opened that up to people to release apps for the DS, can you imagine how much money they'd make?
2541141	2542002	It's just ridiculous.
2543083	2544004	But it's the same thing there.
2544024	2553450	I can't even really call them a gaming platform anyways because for me, a game console is something that you can actually buy games for, not necessarily just digital downloads.
2553470	2554932	I know that's the future of stuff, but
2556304	2557365	I'm just not seeing it.
2557585	2560067	I think it's more casual.
2562429	2562749	I don't know.
2562889	2565952	I don't think it's ever going to take the place of a handheld game system.
2567013	2569495	I want to read this comment real quick from AlphaCananagram in chat.
2569655	2571816	I love Katamari in its current build.
2571836	2573578	It's the worst eight bucks I've spent.
2573698	2574599	It's neat but slow.
2576280	2578001	Oh, there you go.
2578342	2579382	Listener review of the game.
2580663	2582205	Alright, let's move on.
2584904	2587285	Okay, so some other cool stuff.
2588366	2589726	We talked about this a little bit.
2590267	2593268	You know, Home has finally made its way out, or at least the beta of it.
2594969	2596950	It is a 77 meg download.
2597390	2603093	However, you do need to have, I believe, three gigs dedicated to...
2604130	2604610	to this.
2604991	2614859	Yeah, when you start it up, it says that you have to dedicate three gigs of your drive to the game, and it says okay, and then you basically, it partitions off a part of the drive for it.
2614879	2615619	I don't know what it's doing.
2615960	2616760	It reserves part of the drive.
2617241	2619442	That's because you're downloading new areas as you go.
2619943	2621404	You can go in there and download new stuff.
2621424	2623386	I'm not sure what it's all used for.
2623426	2625627	I don't know if it's caching data or something.
2625647	2629230	I think it's storage of the actual areas and stuff like that, probably the videos.
2629250	2629951	The areas aren't that
2630031	2630831	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2656540	2661141	Maybe it was so that you don't download stuff you don't need, but I just figured the three gigs was some type of cache information.
2661161	2672043	It's probably so that their servers don't crash from everybody downloading it all at once, and that way it saves them a little bit of time, and that way every time it goes in there, it checks to see if there's any updates to it.
2672483	2674124	Kind of like, remember how AOL was?
2674244	2676624	How you'd go to different pages and you'd download updates?
2676704	2678264	It's kind of like that.
2678525	2680685	So it is available right now.
2681085	2681925	You can check it out.
2682365	2684666	However, there are issues, and obviously...
2685666	2693849	They've been having trouble with it staying online and they've had to actually shut down the PlayStation Network for about an hour to fix stuff.
2695509	2698770	Yeah, so it's definitely acting like it was in beta.
2699630	2705392	But it's available to check out and it's been a long time coming.
2707573	2709854	Weren't they having a lot of issues on launch day with the downloads?
2710094	2711214	Yeah, I heard, yeah.
2712217	2717082	I don't know, I got in there very easily, but I didn't remember it was out until like late in the evening.
2717142	2719964	I think I'd been watching a movie and I was like, oh yeah, I want to download Home.
2720124	2721345	Yeah, I'm not going to try it for a while.
2721445	2725389	I just haven't gotten, I'm not really gung-ho to jump into it.
2725969	2727190	It just kind of, eh.
2727651	2732895	It is like the avatars for me, you know, just like on the new Xbox experience or whatever.
2733936	2737680	It was kind of neat, made my avatar, that's it, you know, whatever.
2737700	2738020	Whatever.
2739788	2743791	Question from chatroom, Tigerclaw asks, Interesting, does it let you walk around the world?
2743811	2745372	Does it download in the backgrounds and stuff?
2745712	2752337	It's kind of annoying when you're walking in an environment that appears empty and then about a minute later everything suddenly appears and you appear to have run into a wall.
2752657	2754878	No, it doesn't do that with the environments.
2754918	2757200	That's why you have to download everything before you go in.
2757980	2760202	So it doesn't actually download the environment as you go.
2760582	2766006	What will download as you go, like the movie that's playing in the movie theater, like the Twilight trailer or whatever...
2766206	2766767	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2783005	2785828	But, I don't know, there's really not a lot of point to it.
2786288	2792633	Now, see, but remember when Home was going to let me show whatever movie I wanted to on my screen in my home?
2793034	2793694	Like, remember that?
2793955	2794555	Yeah.
2794575	2795536	We were supposed to have that?
2795616	2796537	Now, that would have been cool.
2796817	2800300	Yeah, I think they got rid of that because of, you know, licensing.
2800440	2806085	I know, because you'd think people would put up, you know, porn and what have you, but... No, I think they weren't even caring about porn.
2806105	2809008	They were caring about people putting up, like, say... Okay, so copyrighted porn.
2809028	2809148	Yeah.
2809528	2820816	Okay, but imagine if we could have had an OLR clubhouse and we could have shot, like, some video just for fun, you know, that could loop in the clubhouse or something that we could have had in there just for fun and, like, change it out once a week or something.
2821097	2827501	Like, that would be great, and that's potential, but I just know that's not going to happen for years.
2827521	2832525	No, is that something, like, kind of like, um... What is it, uh...
2835037	2841941	Do you have to be logged into your account or something like that for someone to be able to jump into your clubhouse?
2842742	2844242	I don't know because clubs aren't available yet.
2844723	2846704	And you're going to have to pay for them when they do come out.
2846804	2850326	I mean, if it's just a small fee, I don't mind paying it just to kind of screw around with it.
2850706	2855029	Because I think there's potential to kind of have the community there.
2855069	2857170	And we're all about community here at OLR.
2857730	2860232	But I want to know a little more about what...
2861772	2862732	You can actually do with it.
2863773	2865493	Because it seems like it's going to be a little limiting.
2865513	2867034	And I don't know if I would have to be on or not.
2867074	2869635	But the PS3 is also one of those systems you can kind of just leave on.
2870075	2871416	It doesn't make any noise or nothing.
2871556	2879239	If you could hook up a PS3 in here and then broadcast our show into that clubhouse and have us on the TV.
2879259	2880459	That's what I was thinking!
2880879	2882380	Wouldn't that be an awesome potential?
2882400	2883160	That would be awesome.
2883300	2893465	Like, if we could actually, because if you can talk through your headset, then that thing supports streaming audio, and I'm sure there would be a way that during the duration of the show we could just shut everyone else up.
2893505	2895106	We shouldn't be giving away all our ideas.
2895166	2896307	Other podcasts are going to steal them.
2896647	2896947	Eh, whatever.
2898107	2898788	Wouldn't be the first time.
2901109	2903370	But, you know, that's kind of like the idea I would want to do.
2904130	2907052	So, there's potential there, but I don't know.
2909582	2911903	Jason says, you can create a club in home and it'll cost $5.
2912843	2913884	Can you actually do that now?
2913944	2915344	When I tried to look at it, you couldn't do it.
2916225	2918205	Did they actually open that up and I just couldn't figure it out?
2921626	2923727	TigerClaw says, this is why Second Life does it better.
2923747	2929589	You can actually create a club, invite people to come over, and the club will actually play music in the background by streaming a shoutcast stream into it.
2930129	2934251	Maybe we should have put a thing in Second Life a long time ago, but it was kind of expensive, wasn't it?
2934271	2934771	I don't remember.
2935051	2935611	It's Second Life.
2935651	2936332	I don't want to touch that.
2936372	2936992	It's like dirty.
2938075	2939156	Home's not much better then.
2939456	2945060	Well, it's not much better, but it's like the new gas station bathroom.
2945160	2946421	It's a brand new gas station.
2946441	2949042	The bathroom hasn't quite gotten all disease ridden yet.
2949583	2949823	All right.
2950123	2951084	Well, let's move on.
2951124	2952245	Let's talk about other PlayStation 3.
2952505	2962491	What could have been, and according to 1Up, apparently what happened, Final Fantasy XI, you know, kind of interesting that it came out on the Xbox 360, but it never really came out on the PlayStation 3.
2962812	2966094	I mean, true, you could do the PS2 backwards compatibility, but even then...
2966514	2971018	Sometimes the hard drive issues will kind of get in the way, I think, depending on what system you owned, I think.
2971318	2977363	But then you can download a patch that would allow you to play it from the PS2 version on the PS3.
2977423	2977983	Okay, that's cool.
2978003	2986971	But at some point they were going to release, I guess, a nicer version, I guess you could say, on the PlayStation 3, probably one with all the expansions included and what have you.
2987351	2994997	Well, apparently it was supposed to happen, but apparently the Sony representative that Square was working with
2995857	3000418	They were working with Hiromichi Tanaka, I guess, just quit.
3001299	3005420	And they never really resumed talks, which is kind of strange.
3006600	3011161	Oh well, Final Fantasy XI is still getting three new expansions next year, but not through the traditional retail channels.
3011181	3014002	They will all be downloadable story expansions.
3014082	3019623	No new classes, none of that stuff, just story and quest expansions, which is interesting.
3020143	3021384	I assume zone expansions too.
3022478	3024880	So, yep, Final Fantasy XI on the PS3.
3024920	3025620	It was an idea.
3026261	3030184	So if you wondered why it wasn't there, somebody else must have been thinking the same thing, but then they just gave up.
3031024	3032826	Yeah, they didn't care like some of us.
3033226	3033586	I guess.
3033786	3035408	I'm kind of over Final Fantasy XI.
3036228	3037549	You're in another addiction now.
3037949	3038930	Yeah, I have WoW now.
3039290	3044754	But I would like to revisit Final Fantasy XI someday when it gets redone and has a new, like Final Fantasy XI 2.
3046155	3046456	Why not?
3046476	3047176	They did X-2.
3047216	3047717	Why can't they do X-11 2?
3049168	3051109	Because they have good taste sometimes.
3051169	3051770	Oh, shush.
3053691	3056073	Well, here's something that should excite a lot of people.
3057594	3060696	I know there's a lot of our listeners out there who are fans of Fallout 3.
3061236	3071142	Well, for the PC, Bethesda actually brought out a PC tool set for Fallout 3 so that you can...
3072643	3076567	I guess create your own levels.
3076627	3080931	You can modify and edit buildings, landscapes, dialogue characters.
3080971	3084674	Basically, you can just change it all up into your own game pretty much.
3085675	3086096	That's right.
3086116	3087077	Loki's not all over this.
3087317	3090400	It was called the Garden of Eden Creation Kit.
3091621	3094523	I don't really mod games anymore.
3095164	3098327	I wait for other people to mod them and then add to it.
3098923	3101744	You can download it off of the Fallout 3 website.
3101824	3103564	It's 8.47 megabytes.
3103645	3114868	I want someone to do the wondrous thing that someone has done with the Half-Life editor and make me a Hypercube version of Fallout 3.
3115728	3119209	I would like to see one where the world ended because of something Jamie did.
3120230	3121390	Make a Maniac Mansion!
3123091	3124231	Seriously, you totally could.
3124807	3125587	It'll be pretty awesome.
3127028	3135212	Well, actually, I was going to say, other than all the cool stuff for Half-Life, Grand Theft Auto 4, they have some of the first mods out there for it.
3135672	3143716	Of course, the game actually doesn't allow you to run files that are modified, but someone's found a way around it, like it was cake or something.
3145396	3148918	And they've made pistols that fire rockets, which are pretty funny.
3149258	3152460	And then also pistols and machine guns that have...
3153160	3154401	Thanks for watching!
3175231	3176332	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3198523	3203708	is some brand new download content, and that'll be coming soon.
3205110	3219543	What's kind of neat about the download content, though, is they're going to be raising the level cap on it, and you'll actually be able to... I don't know what level they're going to raise it to, but I know right now it's pretty limited.
3219563	3222206	I think it's like 30 or something.
3223973	3225614	Fightin' Alaska Fightin' Alaska Fightin' Alaska
3249275	3250236	4-5 hours long, 800 Microsoft Points
3280117	3283118	All right, well, shifting gears here a little bit, talking about a different type of quest.
3283258	3287300	I promised there'd be a story on WoW tonight, and it's not really the type of story you might be expecting.
3287440	3290621	It's actually something game politics ran, so you know it's going to involve controversy.
3291181	3291781	Something political.
3292201	3295703	It has to do with World of Warcraft, and they are actually re-re-re-
3296883	3298544	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3318069	3319150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3337083	3342127	There's a quest where you basically torture a prisoner to get information out of him to move on.
3342687	3344188	And this is what Richard Bartell said about it.
3344648	3347550	Basically, you have to take some type of cowpoke and zap a prisoner until he talks.
3347890	3348931	I'm not at all happy with this.
3348971	3355336	I was expecting for there to be some way to tell the guy who gave you the quest that no, actually, I don't want to torture a prisoner, but there didn't seem to be any way to do that.
3355696	3362460	Worse, the quest is part of a chain you need to complete to gain access to the Nexus, which is the first instance you encounter if you start at the west of the continent as I did.
3363001	3366063	So either you play along and zap the guy or you don't get to go to the Nexus.
3367498	3367758	It's a game!
3389729	3398573	And I'm kind of, I'm just kind of a little bit in disbelief because it's like, well, A, he's completely misstating the thing about you have to do this quest to enter the Nexus.
3398593	3399233	That's not true.
3400174	3403155	You can enter the Nexus whenever, you know, you can get summoned there.
3403215	3406077	You just don't get the quest line or what have you.
3406097	3411719	But you don't, I mean, there's like 50,000 quests now and I'm obviously overstating that.
3411739	3413640	There's lots and lots of quests in Wrath of the Lich King.
3414020	3418962	Trust me, you can level your character to 80 and only play through like 4 of the zones.
3419423	3420703	And there's like 7 or 8 zones.
3420723	3422004	So you could skip this all together.
3422044	3423444	You could start on the East Continent or whatever.
3423484	3424185	But anyway, okay.
3424765	3432629	Even if you couldn't skip this and it was a part of the game, I mean, do you write angry letters every time you watch an episode of 24 and he tortures a prisoner?
3433149	3434389	Or every time you watch a movie?
3434950	3440412	Or every time somebody wrote a torture scene in a mud game somewhere on the internet, which I'm sure exists somewhere?
3441293	3441913	I mean, hello?
3444063	3446446	What is it we always say here that you started here, Jay?
3447027	3447928	Learn to be offended!
3448369	3448609	Yes.
3450111	3450832	Fucking people.
3451713	3455117	I mean, it's just a game.
3455197	3461385	And, you know, if you want to, you just go to the quest and you click Abandoned Quest and there, you don't have to do it.
3462066	3462687	How hard was that?
3465524	3473631	Anyway, the kind of ignorance stated here, even if this guy is a big deal for what he did, it was kind of a silly thing to state here.
3473691	3478315	So, you know, I'm just going to do the angsty FUs part of the show right now.
3493866	3495428	I don't care if this is political.
3496008	3499952	A big blaming fuck you to George Bush.
3500853	3510502	For all of the series of legislation he's just passed during his last blessed day, you know, the end of his, you know,
3511543	3512204	and DarkSakura.
3538820	3555672	Also for passing a law that pretty much lets any doctor not perform any kind of procedure based on moral, personal ethics, not necessarily the overall ethics of the community that they represent.
3556372	3573347	and it's really disgusting a lot of it is from as far as I could tell unconstitutional and I'm sure quite a bit of it can be overturned under congressional review which is the one good thing that Newt Gingrich ever did apart from being hilarious on TV
3574068	3576969	Thank you for watching!
3589975	3591135	I was going to say F you to
3619989	3622591	Take 2 for putting out a crappy version.
3622692	3627156	Well, I should say a buggy version of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC.
3627876	3637325	The fact that I've got to still wait for patches before they support something that most modern games support now is ridiculous.
3639676	3643798	I don't know, I just hate having to wait before a game to work correctly.
3645459	3652623	If I'm spending the money to buy the game, why does it have to be weeks later that I get a game that actually works?
3655304	3655685	Is that it?
3657100	3657481	My F.U.
3657501	3660663	of the week goes to potstickers because they're really addicting.
3661604	3665647	I just can't stop eating potstickers.
3665707	3667989	It's like the food I've been craving.
3668129	3673433	Anytime I go out to a restaurant that might have them, I have to get potstickers because they're so freaking addicting.
3673453	3676516	I feel like I'm pregnant or something and craving things I don't usually crave before.
3676816	3678117	And that food is potstickers.
3679138	3680939	I know, it's so random, but that's what it is.
3681500	3682961	You're growing a gas baby.
3683201	3683541	Apparently.
3683581	3684102	Apparently.
3685393	3687415	So F you to potstickers for being so non-malicious.
3688576	3688956	There you have it.
3691699	3694401	And I've learned you can get potstickers lots of different places.
3694461	3697704	It's pretty surprising, and I've probably sampled them everywhere.
3697844	3700026	Anyway, hey, let's move back into some gaming news.
3700346	3702428	Let's try to get this show actually back on the track of gaming.
3703911	3704912	Dragon Quest X is going to be on Wii
3727037	3728098	And that's pretty cool.
3728758	3736364	It's also going to be, as far as I'm aware, the first of the Dragon Quest games on the Wii, so that's pretty cool.
3737425	3744310	And the Japanese release date, by the way, for Dragon Quest IX is going to be March 28th.
3745271	3747993	So it's going to be 5980 yen.
3748233	3749955	Yay.
3751696	3753397	Cool.
3753697	3755319	Some other cool stuff that will be...
3757281	3759362	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3777592	3787802	Well, now, apparently, a used copy of the game Scrabble, which apparently learns words based on stuff that you add in there.
3791206	3798934	This kid actually was playing it, and apparently Scrabble beat him on a triple word score with the word fuckers.
3801670	3807613	and apparently the mother of... That's what I call my DS when it beats me at a game.
3807753	3808153	Fucker!
3808873	3821540	The mother, I guess, apparently, Tonya, she had bought this game for her son, Ethan, and it was a pre-owned copy, I guess, of Ubisoft Scrabble, which I didn't realize... I don't think they have that over here.
3821940	3823300	I wish they did, because Scrabble's awesome.
3824181	3824261	Um...
3825527	3826248	DS Over His Shoulder
3845705	3847246	How else did she find out about it?
3865774	3873370	So apparently, you know, this, you know, is coming from, I guess... You know what she should have done is simply challenged the word.
3873971	3876617	Because I don't think you'd be able to find it in the official Scrabble dictionary.
3877742	3881344	Well, apparently, this is coming from a tabloid, Daily Mail.
3881525	3884687	You know, they're hosts of a bunch of useless articles.
3884707	3885307	So reliable?
3885567	3885807	Yes.
3886908	3896534	Ubisoft is saying that she should have used the game's junior settings, because I guess Fuckers isn't in the junior version of Scrabble, and Nintendo, of course, doesn't want anything to do with it.
3896554	3898616	That's why we'll just use, you know, Lil' Fucker.
3898816	3900797	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
3900897	3902959	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
3903079	3906241	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
3907455	3914564	J100 Matt in chat says, why do these fucking kids need to tell their parents that their games are cursing at them?
3923792	3924452	I would laugh.
3924633	3925693	I would think that's awesome.
3925733	3926894	I would show it to my friends.
3926974	3928095	That's what you're supposed to do.
3928955	3931617	Look at my boy, dude.
3931637	3934439	He spelled tits on triple word.
3934659	3939523	Instead of little Ethan going, Mommy, Mommy, my game swore at me.
3939703	3940743	I'm telling.
3941644	3942525	Little punk kid.
3943445	3945567	I think there's actually a version of Scrabble.
3945587	3950870	And you want to know, she's totally grooming him to be a little wuss anyways.
3950930	3952211	Him and his pink DS.
3955046	3955566	Hey, wait a minute.
3956647	3957047	You know, here.
3959828	3961489	You know, there's some type of Scrabbles.
3961509	3964010	You know how every board game has their own house rules?
3964050	3971153	Like in Monopoly, you might have a house rule where all the tax money goes into a free parking jackpot for when you land on free parking, right?
3972473	3977575	Well, I think there's some house rules for Scrabbles where dirty words automatically are triple word score.
3978036	3980357	So it encourages people to use bad words.
3980497	3981917	Yes, we do that all the time.
3982137	3982638	Absolutely.
3983806	3985907	We even played Ebonics Scrabble one time.
3986387	3988348	Oh, God.
3989509	3990029	Wow.
3990850	3991230	Wow.
3992150	3994651	If it sounded like a word, it was a word.
3997033	3998053	I'd like to play that sometime.
3998073	3998593	That would be fun.
4002155	4002415	Anyhow.
4004606	4012690	One game I was mad when they discontinued many years ago and made me yell, Fuckers, was when they got rid of the Great Giana Sisters.
4012710	4016612	1987 was the year that this game was originally released, and it was pretty awesome.
4016652	4021074	It was on the Commodore 64, but the problem was, it looked and felt just like Mario.
4021154	4023595	Although, if you actually played it, there was a lot of differences.
4023635	4029718	Like, for instance, hello, in the Great Giana Sisters, you actually fight a giant enemy crab at the end of the second level.
4030378	4032960	I know, this predates even the PlayStation 3, but unfortunately...
4033800	4034561	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4062017	4062857	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4075362	4082527	It's going to have over 80 levels, and apparently the DS microphone is going to play into the game somehow, and they'll actually use the touchscreen and everything.
4083267	4092754	Now, one of the great things about the original game was the soundtrack, and the new version, Chris Hilsbeck, is coming back to do remixed versions of the original soundtrack.
4093354	4094435	So that's pretty awesome.
4096696	4103838	And this is one of those games where, you know, if you've never played this game, maybe some week we'll highlight it as a classic game of the week down the road.
4103878	4106620	But it's one of those games you definitely should check out.
4106720	4108860	I'm sure there's clips on YouTube of the game.
4109181	4111281	And just, you know, you can see its similarities to Mario Bros.
4111562	4112882	But it was kind of neat.
4113442	4115963	It was a fun game, especially for that era.
4116163	4121886	You know, it doesn't really hold up against today's games, which is why I'm interested to see kind of what they do to it on the...
4123759	4125561	DS version, how they're going to make it unique.
4125581	4127923	But based on the screenshots, it looks a lot different.
4127943	4130084	It definitely doesn't look like Mario anymore, that's for sure.
4131706	4132026	We'll see.
4133687	4134168	Let's move on.
4135789	4139672	Well, moving forward, it looks like we've actually got some release dates.
4140393	4141273	How does that sound?
4141373	4142254	Release dates!
4142995	4145657	Well, it is December, so what else can we expect?
4146237	4148219	Let me go ahead and take a look.
4148956	4149536	For the UK.
4149837	4152018	Exactly, for the UK.
4152838	4159282	Actually, it's Crash Commando and Sonic Unleashed.
4160582	4161423	That's really it.
4162584	4164985	I was going to be a little bit more excited, but I guess not.
4166536	4168577	I can't say things are much better in the US, though.
4169338	4175682	There are a few things coming out, so it's not that bad, but it's certainly not in November or anything like that.
4176443	4178144	This week, though, some of the highlights.
4179365	4181907	Rise of the Argonauts will be coming out on all systems.
4182007	4184148	Well, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4185709	4189972	Also, this week, we've got the release of some DS games.
4190333	4192454	Kate West, The Vanishing Files...
4194396	4197142	We've also got Mystery PI, Portrait of a Thief
4199172	4201393	and Dreamer Horse Training.
4201653	4205294	Because, goddammit, there's not enough horse training games.
4205894	4207895	And then Puppy Training, which has a really cute cover.
4208315	4208795	That's awesome.
4209975	4212536	Slingo Quest, also coming out from DS.
4212576	4214877	It's a mumbo-jumbo casual game.
4215897	4220718	And Neopets Puzzle Adventure, ripping off Puzzle Quest there.
4222339	4223539	And let's see...
4225709	4228371	Lots of crappy DS games this week, man, I swear.
4229091	4234894	Australia Zoo Quest, which is a puzzle game and for some reason has Saberwin on the cover.
4235635	4236735	Yes, crikey indeed.
4237996	4242779	Learn Math for grades 1 through 4, a math learning game.
4243639	4245480	Driver's Ed Portable on DS.
4245800	4247081	Yes, you can learn how to drive.
4248800	4251502	and other things other than DS games.
4251742	4254624	There's a few Destiny or Wii games.
4254984	4260327	Summer Sports 2, Island Sports Party, their party game, and Wurjong Party.
4260647	4262989	It's a Mahjong party game.
4263729	4264189	Interesting.
4265110	4269893	And Rock Band 2 on the Wii.
4270173	4272775	The game-only version will be coming out on the 18th.
4275158	4281341	and, uh, I just gotta mention this on the 19th, Calvin Tucker's Redneck Jamboree.
4282362	4282882	Oh, goody.
4283122	4283682	On the Wii.
4284663	4284963	That's it.
4286195	4291740	Well, you know, if you want a busy week for game releases, you need to look at Japan, because there's tons of stuff coming out in Japan this week.
4291780	4297685	Now, granted, a lot of it is localized versions of stuff we've already had here in the US, but let me talk about what's coming out in Japan.
4298266	4299928	Starting with 360, we have just that.
4299968	4301729	A big release for Japan would be Fable 2.
4301869	4304091	The localized version is coming out this week, December 18th.
4305493	4311138	Lego Batman, Need for Speed Undercover, and Prince of Persia also all being released on the 360 in Japan this week.
4311278	4315182	Also a game local for Japan, Gundam Musou 2 comes out in Japan.
4315723	4320448	And this game is a shooter that looks to be probably based on Gundam.
4321772	4323633	Yep, robots with guns.
4323813	4324813	Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2.
4324853	4325654	There you go.
4326434	4328275	That game is coming on the Xbox 360 this week.
4328895	4331296	Moving on to the PlayStation 3, many of those same titles.
4331316	4333217	There's also Gundam Musou 2 comes out there as well.
4333977	4339040	Lego Batman, Medal of Honor gets a price drop, as does the Godfather and Armored Core.
4339880	4341741	That's what you've got to look forward to on the PlayStation 3.
4342944	4348148	Although I do want to point out there's also a wireless keypad available now in Japan if you want to check that out.
4348489	4351071	Hey, on the Wii, they have a game called Let's Tap.
4351531	4353553	It's coming out from Sega in Japan.
4353573	4355914	That's the one where it's the game that penguins can play.
4356835	4357396	Oh, that's right.
4357436	4358757	A game that even penguins can play.
4358837	4363060	You set the Wiimote on the box and you tap the box.
4363360	4365022	You don't actually use the controller at all.
4365042	4365462	Yes, yes.
4365522	4365782	Okay.
4366123	4366923	Kind of looks interesting.
4366963	4369906	There's all these little visualizers and things.
4370026	4371507	They're bringing that over here, right?
4372930	4376934	Bleach vs. Crusade Dance Dance Revolution Furu Furu Party Elebits Price Reduction
4392729	4402275	Also, going on the PlayStation 2, a little game called Beatmania 2DX gets its 15th game in the series on PlayStation 2 this week.
4402315	4404656	DJ Troopers comes out on December 18th.
4405357	4411340	Not the 15th game on the PlayStation, however, because they didn't start with... They started on 3rd style.
4411580	4414982	But this would be the 12th game on the PlayStation 2 in the 2DX series.
4415662	4418024	In Japan only, that's not even counting the one we got in the U.S.,
4419305	4432434	Fate Unlimited Codes is also coming out on the Playstation 2 as well as another version of Gundam Musou 2 for the Playstation 2 and Pachinko Series Volume 13 Neon Genesis Evangelion yet another one
4434293	4434933	Princess Ballerina
4462321	4465042	Yumei Miru, 4Gen, no, Primadonna.
4466823	4467743	Don't you like Primadonnas?
4468704	4472085	No, but I'm watching Bush get a shoe thrown at him and that's pretty fucking funny.
4472145	4472586	Top it.
4473086	4475427	Lego Batman also comes out.
4476747	4480109	Gensu Suikoden Tier Kreese comes out.
4480129	4482070	That would be the Suikoden's strategical title.
4482890	4484331	So it's a busy week in DS world.
4484771	4488073	And as far as the PSP goes, all the other systems are getting love.
4488093	4488913	Why not the PSP?
4489413	4491094	And yes, Final Fantasy Dissida.
4491454	4492415	Star Wars The Clone Wars
4513908	4519092	Need for Speed Undercover, Samurai Shodown Anthology, Ultimate Board Game Collection, all on the PSP.
4519172	4521753	Very busy week in Japan for releases.
4522474	4522994	So there you go.
4524235	4525556	Let's move on with more news.
4526217	4527557	And then we're going to take a quick break here.
4530159	4531940	Well, there is a little bit more.
4532821	4535243	This actually has to do with some...
4538015	4540616	with something having to do with Rockstar.
4542017	4543438	Actually, I think it already happened.
4543538	4554345	There was a social club event put out by Rockstar for Midnight Club Los Angeles and Grand Theft Auto 4 that was going on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
4555545	4563030	They were supposed to have a little contest as in a video editor contest for GTA 4 PC and
4565131	4572554	and then for topping the Midnight Club Ocean to LA time trial and there were supposed to be prizes available for both.
4573814	4586058	It was though already going on and I do believe it was from 5 to 9 UK time actually I think today so already gone.
4586798	4588599	Good luck to whoever won.
4588619	4591660	It was pretty cool.
4594350	4608313	um some other fun stuff um prototype um you may remember this game being kind of like an open world uh crackdown meets you know kind of mutants type of thing um
4609628	4610389	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4627283	4630764	And there was all sorts of different gameplay videos and stuff like that.
4632184	4634905	You know, that was supposed to be stuff that they were showing off at CES.
4634965	4647287	And then, you know, a few, I guess a day later or so, the whole was covered back up and the countdown back to CES was put back on the website.
4648647	4653949	Well, the funny thing is about all that, that's what they want you to think, you see.
4655349	4655869	The whole...
4656914	4659295	The whole leak was a hoax, actually.
4660716	4662277	Perpetrated... Do people know that?
4663157	4663297	No.
4664098	4668720	Perpetrated by... So wait, you're saying the game blogs all got punk this week?
4668840	4670121	Yes, they all got punk this week.
4670821	4673983	Perpetrated by their marketing team.
4674443	4675103	And how do you know this?
4675424	4676144	You're making this up.
4676184	4676984	You make this shit up.
4677204	4678145	No, I don't make this shit up.
4679508	4682710	I know this because they sent out an email boasting about it.
4683230	4685832	So it's all a ruse.
4685852	4686232	To who?
4686292	4686712	To you?
4687012	4689114	Why would Activision send you an email boasting about it?
4689574	4699260	They send it to all of their retail partners to let their customers know because they're trying to drive up buzz for prototyping because...
4700060	4704084	Everybody loves leaked assets, and so they're going to start talking about it.
4704204	4708728	If it was just a release of assets, it might not have been getting as much attention.
4709009	4712872	But since it was something forbidden, people are interested in it.
4712992	4713873	And it worked.
4714033	4718297	It got them all to cover this leak and got all the information out there.
4718598	4723863	The videos were ranked pretty high in game trailers, and that's all good news.
4724403	4725144	Good buzz for them.
4725184	4727465	Because people want to see things they're not supposed to be seeing.
4727625	4728046	Exactly.
4728066	4729326	But it was a hoax the whole time.
4729466	4730807	The whole time it was a hoax.
4731928	4737132	They made it look like it was an FTP directory and everything, and they got you all.
4739213	4740294	And people don't know this yet.
4741054	4741955	You're the one telling them.
4742595	4746358	People don't know it, but it doesn't really matter, because the game looks awesome.
4747179	4753523	The whole thing is they're tricking the people that they normally work with in the media to cover their game.
4754051	4757533	What are they... Surely these people are going to find out eventually if they haven't already.
4757833	4759134	Do you think there's going to be retaliation?
4759334	4759474	No.
4760554	4762395	I think this stuff happens all the time, to be honest.
4762536	4764156	Okay, well, here's another thing, though.
4764256	4769439	Could they be saying now that, oh, yeah, we meant for that to happen, when maybe they didn't?
4769719	4770960	No, it was in great detail.
4772401	4778284	In fact, you know who tipped them off that the site had been broken?
4780219	4780839	Thanks for watching!
4795920	4804146	I don't know, survey sites and stuff like that and you may think, hey, why aren't these publishers doing anything to stop these leaks?
4804807	4810431	Sometimes they're intentional and sometimes that's how they drive buzz for stuff.
4811432	4814034	Just a little bit of insight in the back workings of the...
4815074	4816175	Game Publishing World
4845540	4846581	Yeah, the game looks awesome.
4846721	4848763	I mean, it's going to be a really fun game.
4848783	4851625	It's definitely going to be something I pick up because it's like crackdown.
4851666	4852366	I mean, come on.
4853167	4854348	Definitely something I'll be playing.
4856977	4857257	All right.
4857657	4860658	Well, moving on before we take a break here on the show.
4860798	4862099	That was a pretty big bombshell.
4862119	4863699	We should have probably said that earlier in the show.
4863779	4864379	Yeah, whatever.
4864399	4865459	It's not that big of a deal.
4865479	4868680	A little reward to those who actually pay attention to the whole thing, I guess.
4870061	4873982	Also, reward for being persistent and working at things.
4875142	4878183	Not really gaming news, but kind of a gaming funny, I guess you could say.
4879384	4880364	At Missouri State...
4881044	4881725	Thanks for watching!
4898459	4902382	So knowing that, he realized, it's in the next room.
4902722	4904783	No, well, not necessarily, but he knew it was 30 feet away.
4905103	4915890	So through the process of elimination, what he did, he actually went to the 4th, 5th, and 6th floors and found that the controller still worked on the 4th floor, 5th floor, and 6th floor, but it would not work on the 3rd or 7th floor.
4916351	4918372	So process of elimination, where was the Xbox?
4918692	4920113	On the 5th floor, the middle one, right?
4920433	4926536	So then he went to the fifth floor and using the... Because if you get too far from the Xbox, the thing will start blinking.
4926876	4930277	So using the process of elimination, he found out where the center was.
4930298	4931198	He was hot and cold.
4931678	4932098	Basically, yeah.
4932118	4933539	He was playing hot and cold with his controller.
4933859	4935940	And it told him exactly where the stolen Xbox was.
4936440	4942923	And they actually got the RA, the resident assistant, to go into the room where the stolen Xbox supposedly was.
4943263	4944284	They found the Xbox.
4944724	4947965	And apparently, what's really funny about it is that the...
4949486	4952867	The Thief wasn't around when they got it, so kind of interesting.
4952887	4953728	But they know who lives there.
4954748	4954968	Yeah.
4955929	4956849	Interesting, interesting.
4958890	4960910	See, people actually do have a brain in college.
4960930	4961831	People are retarded.
4962091	4963912	Well, some people have a brain in college.
4964032	4966173	Yeah, the person who stole it obviously doesn't have a brain.
4966193	4966893	They're retarded.
4967333	4968073	They'll be going home.
4968854	4969614	Seriously.
4970474	4975016	I don't know, I'd be pressing charges, but that would be me, because, you know, I totally don't care.
4978671	4979812	That's a stupid award.
4980792	4981193	In a way.
4981213	4982413	For the loser that stole it.
4982554	4987137	Well, but the thing is, I more give props to the guy who used the investigative skills to figure it out.
4987417	4987977	You know what I mean?
4987997	4990459	So that's like a spy versus spy award.
4990499	4992140	Yes, I guess you could say.
4992160	4993981	It's kind of both at once.
4994882	4995422	A good job.
4995902	4997623	It's kind of like, what do they call it?
4997643	4998464	Good job, gumshoe.
4998704	4999665	Remember Carmen Sandiego?
4999845	5000065	Yeah.
5000105	5001546	So he's the gumshoe of the week award.
5001806	5004328	Dude, I almost actually bought that game on PC last year.
5004676	5005918	What, Where in the World is Karma San Diego?
5006018	5006278	Yeah.
5006298	5007119	That game is awesome.
5007540	5008561	I found it at the thrift store.
5008701	5010264	Isn't that one of those games you can do on GameTap?
5010484	5011125	I'm pretty sure it is.
5011245	5011966	I don't have GameTap.
5011986	5012567	The old school ones.
5013348	5013608	All right.
5013748	5020377	I have ZSNES and Magic Engine and, oh, wait, I actually have the systems too.
5020577	5020838	All right.
5021158	5023441	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5036155	5036875	You okay there, Loki?
5036915	5037295	Sorry.
5037696	5039676	You're just so excited, you're just throwing your microphone.
5039716	5040116	Oh, yes.
5040276	5040576	Alright.
5041477	5045818	DarkSakura, what should the kids be playing this week in the classic video game of the week?
5046038	5050760	The classic game of the week is Willow for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5051000	5051760	You know what's hilarious?
5051820	5053841	I was just thinking about this game today.
5053921	5054601	I shit you not.
5054681	5058883	And I was actually thinking, like, this game needs to be highlighted as the classic game of the week.
5059003	5063344	And I swear to God, like, before I read that you were picking it for tonight, it was amazing.
5063464	5071390	Well, you have to then skip about a minute 25 in the music, because it has the music I like, which is the actual kicking ass outside the village music.
5073611	5073951	Sorry.
5075893	5081657	There you go.
5082077	5083979	See?
5084879	5086921	It's like some of the best video game music ever.
5087121	5090183	You know what other game is awesome that's also based off a movie?
5090423	5090603	What?
5090703	5091384	Addams Family.
5092543	5093983	Fester's Quest was shit.
5095104	5095844	That was pretty cool.
5096904	5098385	Back to Willow.
5099865	5100505	The game came out in 1989.
5100605	5105467	It actually came out for the Famicom first in 1988.
5106667	5110548	Sorry, it actually came out in 1989 on both systems, but the movie came out in 88.
5111528	5116430	So basically you play as Willow and you go by yourself.
5117590	5121915	and it's kind of Zelda-ish, but not really.
5122055	5128943	It's more like, um, kind of playing like Secret of Mana did, actually, but being a Nintendo NES game.
5129584	5133869	Um, but it was put out by Capcom, so it's one of the cool things that Capcom has given us.
5133889	5135951	Why don't we have Willow in a Capcom game, huh?
5138245	5141647	There are also other... I'm thinking licensing for the movie is an issue.
5141667	5142407	I'm joking, right.
5142767	5144028	There are also other games.
5144048	5156933	There was a computer game that came out on Amiga, Atari ST, and a DOS game that came out by a Midnight Entertainment Group, but it wasn't the same game.
5156993	5157793	It was a different one.
5157813	5159734	So anyone who's thinking they've got it, you're wrong.
5160234	5162595	I was going to say, I'm surprised I never played that.
5162815	5163395	That's cool, though.
5163455	5170677	There's also an arcade version, but it was action adventure, and again, it's not like this one.
5170697	5172858	This one is an action RPG.
5173518	5181240	It is a pretty cool little game, and you can get, you know, basically your items and weapons and meet people from the game and go talk to stuff.
5181300	5183901	It's RPG, but it was Willow, and it was pretty cool.
5184641	5187622	Plus, you know, it had acorns that turned people into stone.
5188422	5188802	The end.
5191454	5192174	I love this game.
5193035	5196976	So do I. Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5197076	5199456	Willow on the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5200077	5204178	And there's a complete walkthrough there on YouTube that we were kind of playing the music from there.
5204538	5206159	You can just watch somebody blast through the game.
5206179	5209740	They use cheat codes to do it, but you still get a pretty good feel for what the game looks like there.
5210200	5211040	I love that game.
5211220	5213381	I played the crap out of that game when it came out.
5213401	5217642	That was one of those games I rented and we held onto it for like so long because I didn't want to take it back.
5218022	5219163	Did you end up having to pay for it?
5219243	5219463	Yeah.
5219843	5220283	Well, not...
5220987	5221988	Thanks for listening.
5222048	5222868	We'll be right back.
5243223	5243623	and DarkSakura.
5264346	5264846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5293815	5294696	I don't know.
5294716	5294836	Spring?
5294856	5295036	Summer?
5295076	5295296	Summer?
5320049	5320609	Thanks for watching!
5337659	5338400	Alright, well there you go.
5339441	5342023	Okay, sorry, let's get into some real news now, Loki.
5342343	5355193	Alright, well, apparently a woman from Colorado thinks she has an expert opinion of Nintendo's neglect to provide adequate support for Wii remotes.
5355313	5356434	Yes, there is another...
5358221	5370306	Class Action Lawsuit for Nintendo's lack of adequate straps for their Wii remotes.
5370706	5383472	She claims that even though the new straps are thicker and they are the third version with a new plastic strap, they still fail to secure the Wii remote properly.
5384801	5386742	to the user during strenuous use.
5387442	5402526	Furthermore, the suit alleges that Nintendo has failed to report a single remote strap issue to the Consumer Product Safety Commission in their monthly reports, despite Nintendo's support documents prove the existence of said issues.
5403346	5404267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5418963	5424007	For one, the straps are basically there so that you don't drop the remote on the ground.
5424548	5433735	Furthermore, then they went to reinforce them because idiots don't realize that they are just meant to prevent you from dropping them on the ground.
5433835	5440240	And so they even reinforced them enough to where if you let go accidentally, it probably won't break.
5440400	5442542	But it's no guarantee.
5443463	5447026	Do they need to put a sticker on the Wiimote that says, please touch me gently?
5448004	5449545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5476662	5479945	You know, that's simply just a case of consumer stupidity.
5481567	5484169	Someone needs to just duct tape her into someone's cellar.
5486091	5488073	Will a judge throw this out, yes or no?
5488173	5491176	Will a judge order her to be locked up in a cellar by duct tape?
5492397	5495981	Hey, duct tape is great for everything, you know.
5496597	5498698	Duct Tape will silence the stupid masses.
5498718	5499118	Pretty cool, huh?
5525225	5526165	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
5526505	5535647	Also, should point this out, even bigger for you DS people, Pokemon Platinum, if you're still into collecting them all, Pokemon Platinum, March 22nd.
5536568	5539828	And Circuit City had it listed, but then they pulled it.
5540549	5542869	If that doesn't confirm it, I don't know what does.
5543169	5549451	Shadow or Fire Emblem, that date is close if not accurate.
5549971	5550431	Interesting.
5551844	5553366	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5572464	5573925	Maybe at CES or something?
5573965	5575827	They're going to announce some more games and stuff?
5575867	5577108	Maybe a little bit on the Wii?
5577188	5578949	Okay, CES is not a gaming show.
5579049	5581831	I don't know why people think these huge announcements are going to come out at CES.
5582091	5583673	Well, they're going to announce them at some point.
5583733	5589477	I mean, it's only a few months off, so I would think CES being the next show... Nintendo can do their own thing.
5589697	5591759	They can say, we got Reggie coming to a party.
5592419	5593400	Miyamoto in the house.
5593760	5594581	And the press will show up.
5594921	5597904	But here's the thing, though, Rob, is I think...
5598644	5601165	That they would do something at CES because of the DSi.
5601565	5604626	And, you know, the DSi coming out next year at some point.
5605906	5608287	I mean, that's a technology thing.
5608607	5609728	Alright, fair enough.
5609748	5611708	They may incorporate all into that.
5611968	5612388	I don't know.
5612448	5613529	That's just a guess.
5615029	5617150	Alright, I suppose that's an educated guess.
5617950	5620131	I would say it's like a 7th grade level educated guess.
5620151	5620551	No, I'm kidding.
5622011	5622952	Alright, we'll see what happens.
5623032	5623512	You might be right.
5624718	5630742	I just kind of wanted to go to Consumer Electronics Show just for the laughs and giggles, but I won't be able to go this year, that's for sure.
5630762	5633043	I do know that there are going to be gaming people there.
5633083	5653035	I mean, there's like, I got a, you know, obviously I'm not going to CES, but I got an invite for anybody that's, you know, game retailers or our customers or whatever, if they were going to CES, that they can go sit through a Microsoft presentation and they're going to show them the upcoming stuff that they've got coming out for next year or like...
5653855	5656276	and probably just Halo Wars at that point.
5657937	5658537	Stuff like that.
5660338	5661919	There will be some presence.
5662159	5664460	It's getting bigger, I guess.
5664700	5668962	Well, it's not that far off, so we will see soon if they're going to announce these officially or not.
5669642	5671023	Let's move on.
5671789	5684637	Well, something that is actually official is that there's going to be former members of Team Ninja and those who worked on Brawl doing a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighter going to be on the Wii.
5686055	5687477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5702998	5721111	hoping that they can pull it off I mean that would be really cool I actually did like the old 2D TMNT tournament fighters that was kind of a fun game so hopefully this will have actually I hope it has some of the characters from that series I think it would be fun
5722918	5724679	Team Ninja equals April with Breast Physics
5750969	5752530	Um, let's see.
5753031	5757273	Halo Wars has been announced to be coming out now on March 3rd.
5758073	5760415	And, um, kind of interesting.
5760435	5768159	There's a lot of stuff coming out right there in March, especially since I think a week before that you have Killzone 2 on the PS3.
5768300	5776164	Um, now of course Halo Wars is the RTS, um, kind of prequel to the whole Halo series.
5776985	5778646	And they've got, um...
5779306	5779927	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5808809	5814192	and apparently coming out in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East the day after.
5816573	5818094	Almost a worldwide release there.
5819494	5827178	It'll be interesting to see how that is because I know it's probably not going to do as well as a normal Halo game because it's not a first person shooter.
5827198	5828299	But it has a Halo name on it.
5828399	5835222	It does have a Halo name on it and there are a lot of RTS fans out there so they're hoping to kind of be like a StarCraft but
5836585	5837185	I don't know.
5837646	5838706	That's tough.
5856581	5857742	Take this all with a grain of salt.
5876827	5877588	Thank you for watching!
5893220	5897202	But it's nice to know, especially because I guess it did pretty well on Xbox Live.
5897862	5899263	It's nice to hear there's interest there again.
5899523	5904086	I just hope whatever this is doesn't come out on Wii, that it is another HD game.
5904606	5905266	Does that make sense?
5906047	5907608	I don't know.
5907728	5909429	Also, kind of some other things going on.
5909669	5916652	Apparently, whatever Mystery Project LMNO that was going on at EA, apparently that is now on ice right now.
5916712	5919794	I shouldn't say gone forever, but just on hold because of all the layoffs that were going on.
5920034	5921135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5945865	5954150	Well, I mean, heck, what do you call this Halo 3 Dark, or no, it has a new name now, all the random numbers and letters or whatever, it's just Halo 4, right?
5955391	5955571	Hmm.
5955971	5956291	I don't know.
5956992	5960634	There you have it, some rumors out of Electronic Gaming Monthly.
5961234	5962155	Take with grain of salt.
5962469	5977696	Well, we have a little bit more rumor, more like a hint, is that there could quite possibly be Halo 2, not Halo 2, Fable 2, available as a full digital download.
5978316	5980797	So that's pretty interesting.
5982198	5985480	It was basically when asked if...
5987598	5993443	If there would be, the quote is, I can't say anything else on it, I would be killed to death.
5994984	5997586	So, I think that's pretty interesting.
6001189	6011817	Yeah, it's interesting because that would be the first, at least on the Xbox 360, sorry, the PS3 already did this with the Burnout game, but on the 360 where you would have a full
6012267	6013188	GameSpot swears they're not worried.
6034343	6034903	I'm sorry, GameStop.
6049611	6055913	It's definitely not taking away too much from buying games.
6055933	6060875	If anything, you look at the special editions and the special edition sales.
6060935	6065317	People love their special editions and they keep getting more creative and putting more crap in there.
6065757	6067518	Well, in the case of Fable 2, maybe not so much.
6067538	6069479	They start taking stuff out.
6070579	6074961	For everything else, though, they're still getting people to buy these special editions for...
6076501	6077101	A lot of money.
6077581	6080542	I mean, look at the Legendary Edition stuff of Halo 3 and stuff.
6080982	6083223	Which, by the way, I saw at Fry's this weekend for $59.99.
6083303	6090424	Oh yeah, people bought a lot of those and they weren't selling as hot as people thought.
6090724	6092345	Same with those Halo 3 consoles too.
6093985	6100586	But yeah, I mean, it's definitely going to head that way at some point where they'll allow you to download stuff.
6100686	6103167	But I think also people have to keep in mind...
6104798	6126564	is it really worth it downloading a game like that especially with like a 360 you know where your system might conk out on you then you got to get a new one then you have to find some way to be able to you know have it tied to your new system and also when you're done with it you can't sell it off used which is another thing but you know that for some people that might not be a big deal
6128114	6129275	Yeah, and you only have so much room.
6129495	6131117	I mean, once your hard drive fills up, it fills up.
6131217	6131677	Exactly.
6132057	6132898	That's kind of the bummer.
6133218	6135480	I mean, sure, they can release a new hard drive, but those hard drives ain't cheap.
6135520	6137422	I paid $150 for my 120GB hard drive.
6137682	6141225	Yeah, sadly enough, those hard drives, the actual parts, don't cost that much.
6141626	6144308	And that's the bad thing about it.
6144448	6148091	I mean, they're just laptop hard drives through a special connector.
6148331	6150853	Yeah, don't remind me, because I'm going to get more mad.
6151854	6152975	You keep talking, Loki.
6153035	6153356	But hey!
6153416	6155598	Hey, hey.
6156616	6164483	But you remember, though, that is one plus, though, about the PS3, though, is they do let you upgrade your hard drive and you don't have to buy a special hard drive from them.
6164563	6173632	It's just any hard drive will do, which I think is the way that Microsoft should have gone with their hard drives, if you ask me, but what do I know?
6175310	6186275	One thing, I will say this, you know, despite the hard time I gave the PlayStation 3, you know, for many, many years on this program, I will say this, I will admit this, playing Prince of Persia this week, it's been nice and quiet while I've been playing the game.
6187075	6187775	I'll give it that.
6188036	6188256	Yeah.
6189416	6198140	Um, so other things coming Fable 2's way, of course, a brand new expansion, Not Whole Island, is going to be available to download on December 22nd.
6198720	6202442	It will run you 800 Microsoft points, or that's $10 in real money.
6203402	6204343	And, um...
6205063	6207184	Some interesting things along with that.
6207284	6217451	Of course it's going to add some new costumes, a bunch of new missions, and some other fun stuff including some more achievements as well.
6218724	6220866	There are three achievements tied with this now.
6221306	6230932	There's the collector, which is worth 25 gamer score if you acquire all the mystery items in the box of secret shop or see another hero doing so.
6231592	6234794	The meteorologist, which is worth 50 gamer points.
6235955	6240678	You have to bring all of Knothole Island's weather problems under control or help another hero do it.
6241478	6245059	and The Bibliophile, which is 25 gamer points.
6245239	6250320	Find all the books detailing the history of Knothole Island or help another hero doing so.
6252141	6253641	So, interesting.
6253761	6255181	I may pick this up.
6255301	6259582	I'm not sure yet because I haven't really gotten to Fable 2 that much.
6260803	6262723	I still want to go back to Lost Odyssey.
6262763	6263903	I haven't finished that one.
6263923	6265624	Your wife sure did get to Fable 2, though.
6265744	6266084	Yeah, she...
6266823	6267704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6293769	6295189	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6319133	6320514	In fact, you probably should get all that shit hooked.
6320534	6324056	Since we don't have the adjusted TV cam tonight, you might want to get all that hooked up before we... I will.
6324096	6326398	The minute we go off air, we can just go into that and be done.
6327218	6333882	Hey, Left 4 Dead is another one of those games I really need to check out at some point because I usually don't like first-person shooters that much.
6334163	6335503	But it's Valve and it's zombies.
6335543	6336284	It might be pretty cool.
6336324	6338045	And I've heard nothing but really good things about this game.
6338465	6341327	Except for the fact that people have been cheating on the game.
6341347	6342628	But guess what Valve did this week?
6342668	6344229	They put the hammer down on that.
6344609	6345229	Thanks for watching!
6366295	6368076	You can still do it on your local games.
6368576	6372898	Right, you can still do the thing because it only fixes this when you're playing the live games online.
6372918	6383263	Basically what they did is they used, there's a mod tool that you can, if you have a device to basically rip files off your hard drive, which they actually do sell them, they're like 50 bucks.
6383623	6386544	I'm thinking about picking one up because I need to buy useless crap.
6388345	6392367	You can mod a file on there and it will allow you to do different cheats.
6393365	6393767	In the game.
6394108	6396196	Which might be fun, because I like to cheat in games.
6396477	6397520	And so, yeah.
6398444	6399447	Let's go cheatin'.
6400114	6401235	for local games at least.
6401355	6402296	Let's go cheatin'.
6402316	6403456	That would be a fun game.
6407699	6409341	Cheaters Presents, let's go cheatin'.
6410381	6413484	I didn't mean like cheating on your relationship sense.
6413504	6420509	Did you hear, and I've seen this in our system, I know it's coming, Grey's Anatomy, the game, for Wii and the DS.
6420549	6421249	What the shit?
6421269	6423411	What are you going to make a game out of for Grey's Anatomy?
6423511	6424211	That's what I want to know.
6424431	6425392	They're doing it.
6425432	6426733	They actually have the ESRB
6428274	6429415	I have to stop time.
6457635	6458776	Let me read this real quick.
6458796	6459236	This is funny.
6459396	6461978	It's all from the ESRB description for Grey's Anatomy.
6462038	6463639	It's a story-based role-playing game.
6463659	6472164	It says the storyline contains frequent references to sexual encounters between different characters and dialogue that contains sexual innuendo.
6473004	6479288	For example, is there anyone in this hospital you're not going to sleep with and you want to have sex after surgery?
6479508	6481590	I don't know about you, but that's not a sexual innuendo.
6481630	6483551	That's you want to have sex after surgery.
6484511	6488155	Some scenes take place soon after the characters have had sex.
6488715	6497903	Dialogue also contains minor expletives, for example, hell and ass, and references to alcohol, like you, me, at a restaurant.
6497923	6499104	Oh no, hell and ass!
6500005	6501426	I like the references to alcohol.
6502066	6504688	This game looks like crap, but that'll be funny though.
6505629	6506430	Grey's Anatomy.
6506977	6516001	Grey's Anatomy, The Game, Amazing Hey, I gotta read some comments from the chat about you and Nelly and the way you play Animal Crossing because they had some comments here.
6516721	6520263	Actdeft says, Animal Crossing, the game about time traveling and its effects.
6521924	6522384	Let's see.
6523825	6525966	Press Start says, Tom Nook is gonna break her legs.
6527126	6529047	TigerClaw says, you better do what your wife says, Loki.
6529067	6530468	You don't want to have a divorce over the Wii.
6531269	6534831	And SSJ100Matt wonders aloud, why does Nelly have to cockblock us?
6535831	6540594	And SSJ100Matt also makes this very winner comment about the way you play Animal Crossing.
6549451	6552093	DarkTetsuya asks if you got a blue phone box in your town.
6569373	6575878	Dark Dead Studios says Rocky Horror Picture Show is on Xbox Live Netflix.
6576619	6577540	I didn't even think to look for that.
6577860	6578440	You know what's funny?
6578780	6585406	Did you know that, and I'm not sure, I didn't know this until today, but you can actually change out what bed you have in your attic.
6586026	6586466	Can you?
6586707	6586967	Yes.
6587547	6588628	With any bed that you buy.
6588948	6589228	Oh, neat.
6589369	6593232	Dude, I'm totally putting the regal bed in my attic.
6593832	6595553	I wish I could decorate my damn attic.
6596934	6598756	I'm tired of my attic looking like wood.
6599779	6603821	Just walk up to the bottom of your bed and hit A, and it will allow you to change it.
6604181	6609764	There should just be... Oh, I like Misty says, she says, screw that, I want a TARDIS.
6610225	6612566	I want to have my house be a TARDIS.
6612906	6618809	I'm kind of surprised they're not trying to nickel and dime us yet in Animal Crossing with releasing the stuff that you have to pay for that you can get.
6618829	6620770	I bet Nellie would make them do that.
6620810	6621971	They're not that smart, though.
6622011	6623832	That's the problem, though, with... Because...
6626989	6630711	Here's the thing, is if they had that kind of content, it would be pay to unlock content.
6631011	6634832	And if they had that in the game, someone would figure out how to hack it and unlock it already.
6636813	6637453	Because they'll do that.
6638074	6642935	Or like maybe, okay, the old school Nintendo games, like maybe just have the ones that I have on my virtual console.
6643035	6643376	I don't know.
6643556	6645096	I guess that's kind of dumb.
6645537	6645897	Forget it.
6646977	6647397	They'd never do that.
6647417	6648198	Forget I said anything.
6648858	6649098	All right.
6650777	6655443	Let's get to that statement of the show that we encourage you to participate with our show every week by sending us emails.
6655503	6657265	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6657326	6658988	And DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag.
6659448	6660049	I am.
6660390	6660850	Yes, you are.
6660890	6661291	You better.
6661311	6665036	She's going to read a few of her favorite emails right now.
6665497	6666919	Or I will subject her to watching...
6668018	6672301	Manos, The Hands of Fate Manos, The Hands of Fate
6690825	6693608	Number 11, I think it was, was some karate movie.
6693628	6695049	I don't remember the name of it.
6695069	6695790	I'll have to find it.
6696030	6701715	But the trick was the one dude had no arms and the other dude had no legs.
6703016	6703617	Awesome.
6703977	6707080	And they were actually karate fighting in the movie.
6707540	6709001	It was amazing.
6709102	6712064	I have to figure out what freaking movie it was.
6712164	6714106	Maybe somebody in the chat will know.
6714166	6715627	Did they tie themselves together?
6715647	6715848	Astounding.
6716388	6717349	I have to see this
6741263	6742083	I don't know who put it out.
6742604	6743164	I have to say this.
6743244	6745145	The documentary itself wasn't that good.
6745765	6747486	I want to see the movie.
6747626	6748446	Screw the documentary.
6750067	6750407	Yeah, I know.
6750427	6751167	I just want to see the movie.
6751187	6753608	Why is not Manos the Hands of Fate on there?
6754028	6754409	I don't know.
6754569	6756449	Is that because they NST3K'd it?
6756609	6757990	I will say Howard the Duck was on it.
6758190	6759411	Howard the Duck was on it?
6759531	6760291	As was Ishtar.
6760491	6762272	I love Howard the Duck.
6762832	6763953	That's one of my favorite.
6764033	6765013	It was Xanadu on there.
6765793	6766774	Xanadu was on there.
6767314	6767714	No!
6768574	6769415	I love Xanadu.
6770086	6772007	Yeah, I don't know how Manos the Hands of Fate wasn't on here.
6772047	6773628	It was a pretty poorly done documentary.
6774049	6779932	Maybe they only had access to one studio's films or something, but yeah, I gotta figure out what the name of that movie was.
6779972	6781513	Hold on, I'm getting it right now.
6782474	6784455	If you say the name, I'll remember it.
6784936	6786537	Okay, DarkSakura, read some emails.
6786557	6788678	I'm gonna play music again, because we got on a tangent.
6788718	6789298	Surprise!
6789318	6789859	Fighting Life!
6790439	6791120	Thank you for watching!
6806913	6808635	The Crippled Masters, that's what it was called.
6809215	6810697	How about some emails?
6811177	6811657	How about it?
6813939	6815381	This comes from GS68.
6816001	6817382	Hey, OLR crew.
6817482	6818323	Oh, wait, wait, stop.
6818343	6820145	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
6820465	6821566	You had your turn.
6821646	6826910	In The Crippled Masters, they actually attach themselves to each other to create that person that I was saying they should do it.
6827831	6828412	Awesome.
6831146	6832207	It says right here.
6833267	6835389	The two men are disfigured by their evil leader.
6835429	6838570	It says one man has his arms cut off, the other has his legs burned off with acid.
6838830	6841672	The two men are enemies but struggling with being disabled.
6841832	6852678	One day fighting each other, the wise old yoga master suggests they work together and start training with weapons and team up to help them with the help of a shoulder.
6853178	6854379	YouTube trailers.
6854519	6858381	It says with the help of a shoulder harness so that the man without the YouTube
6858821	6860402	I'm looking at the trailer right now.
6860422	6862404	Three for the other man, and vice versa.
6862444	6864506	Three words better than Voltron.
6866487	6867148	That's awesome.
6867288	6870430	Okay, I'm watching this scene where they cut his arms off.
6871671	6872872	And this is pretty bad.
6873773	6874314	I like it.
6875334	6876435	I have no arms.
6876655	6878457	Loki, you promised not to interrupt the emails now.
6880270	6881091	All right, here we go.
6881111	6881251	Ew!
6881351	6882612	God, that is disgusting.
6883352	6883592	Okay.
6883892	6884213	I'm sorry.
6884233	6884553	Here we go.
6884633	6885053	One more time.
6885513	6886754	Oh, I have a question, actually, Rob.
6888255	6889956	Was The House Where Evil Dwells on there?
6889976	6891818	I don't remember.
6891878	6892398	I don't think so.
6892418	6899883	That's the movie... They had some really fucked up movie from the 70s, though, that was like just a total gore film and had titties and butts and blood and stuff.
6899903	6900663	I don't remember what the name was.
6900683	6900924	It was awful.
6900944	6902345	I love The House Where Evil Dwells.
6902505	6904426	Okay, I have a little story about this, and then I'll do email.
6904486	6904906	Promise.
6904926	6905467	Okay?
6905507	6905787	Okay.
6906929	6908330	I love what Actdeft said in chat.
6908590	6910671	The crippled masters of independent podcasting.
6911151	6912352	No, that might be offensive, though.
6912912	6914433	There are people that are actually handicapped.
6914453	6917614	There are actually crippled masters out there who do podcasts.
6917714	6921316	But you have to admit, it's an awesome idea for a movie.
6921396	6926839	It's not that the people have no... But the fact that it's like that... What was that movie with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder?
6927179	6930720	Where one was deaf and one was... See no evil, hear no evil.
6930760	6932281	It's like that, but karate.
6932841	6933462	Okay, sorry, Jamie.
6933502	6933862	Your point.
6936169	6945132	Okay, so this movie, I saw it when I was like six, something like that, and it was on Showtime, back when Showtime was new.
6946432	6950993	And it was at the time called The House Where Evil Dwells, and I had no idea that was the name of it.
6951573	6957515	I just remembered that it's about these people that move to Japan, get possessed by ghosts, and end up killing each other.
6958615	6959956	Like, the ghosts killed each other.
6961338	6967381	and I have been trying for years, I mean decades, to find this movie.
6967461	6968842	I did not remember the name of it.
6968922	6970983	I was so little, I didn't remember.
6971043	6976205	But I remembered scenes from it, including the ghost-possessed crabs chasing the girl at the tree.
6976686	6980367	Which is why evil alien crabs always, giant alien crabs always make me crack the fuck up.
6980688	6983269	Because I always remember they go to roar sound.
6983829	6992338	Well, you know, like, you hear, like, the... For lack of a better description, I guess, like, the Japanese ghost noise, you know, that sounds, like, really deep.
6993299	6993520	You know.
6993920	6994160	Anyway.
6995822	6998325	No, that's Broken Neck Ghost Woman.
6999666	7000167	And that's more like...
7003962	7005383	Anyway... This show's terrible.
7005563	7006263	So... Shut up!
7006563	7019010	Anyway, so... So, um... Last... It's like, I think six months ago, I finally, finally found a review of the damn movie, found the name of it, and bought it on Amazon for five bucks.
7019410	7020831	And I'm making you watch it with me.
7021971	7022451	No!
7023292	7024632	You want to use that to do with me?
7024793	7029375	Okay, but we have to find the cheerleader movie that was on that list and watch that too, because that looked amazing!
7029966	7032867	I want to see a cheerleader movie.
7033168	7033788	Do we get to know?
7034588	7035349	Can we do email now?
7035569	7035789	Sure.
7036629	7038890	I think you totally need to see this movie.
7041491	7042052	Okay.
7043172	7043612	God.
7049235	7051516	So, first email from GS68.
7051536	7051616	GS68.
7053925	7055686	Hey, OLR crew!
7056167	7060930	If you've already covered what I just brought up in the subject line, just ignore this email.
7061431	7073980	But anyway, Sunnyvale Golfland is holding a location test for the North American version of DJ Max Technica sometime next week, somewhere in the December 17th to 19th range, and I thought I'd share this with you guys.
7074101	7078344	Kudos to Corey Virtue from Bimani Style for bringing this up.
7078843	7084107	I'm texting Shane right now to get a reaction out of him because I don't know anyone that loves this game more than him and he's going to be pissed.
7084768	7088691	I encourage people living in NorCal who are interested in Technica to come check it out.
7088831	7089592	GS68.
7089672	7090012	P.S.
7090032	7095977	This email was brought to you by Tetris the Grandmaster, home of the ending Tetrominoes.
7097258	7099099	Okay.
7099119	7099940	I... Okay.
7100921	7101801	So, DJ Max.
7102162	7102262	Yo.
7102302	7102422	Yo.
7104957	7105977	Have you seen this new one yet?
7106357	7107358	I'm curious to check it out.
7107518	7108738	Shane made me watch YouTubes of it.
7108778	7111419	It looks interesting.
7111479	7113220	It doesn't look anything like the PSP one to me.
7113380	7114240	It's just the same music.
7115481	7116681	I'd be curious to check it out.
7119522	7121443	I don't have any plans next weekend.
7124824	7125304	Cancel them.
7125664	7129126	I'm going to Old Folsom and eating good food and shopping.
7129186	7132227	We can eat good food and shop in the bay and play DJ Max.
7132547	7133247	Who are you going with?
7133905	7136228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7147233	7153700	So, moving forward, um, hey guys, Loki, a few episodes back you said that Wii music is for five-year-olds.
7154601	7155282	I object.
7155782	7162189	My recently turned six brother loves to play video games, and not only games, he plays Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.
7162269	7166714	He strums and he yells at me to press the buttons while we work our way through Slow Ride.
7167455	7169137	There's your lol for the day.
7171391	7171751	P.S.
7171952	7175553	Sky, put the podcast up faster.
7175913	7176473	P.P.S.
7176973	7178994	I hope I pass the grammar Nazi test.
7179154	7180534	This is Orange Lounge.
7180914	7181374	Geekboy2424.
7181474	7183435	Think of it this way.
7183455	7185455	You're going to get an awesome Christmas present pretty soon.
7185475	7187776	You put it in an ellipsis where you're not supposed to, by the way.
7187796	7191357	You're supposed to use two dashes, not an ellipsis.
7193238	7194078	I'll take care of that later.
7195043	7196825	SuperHappyFuntimeShow
7214814	7215594	I hate that show.
7215754	7216254	No, I'm kidding.
7216294	7216795	It's great.
7217995	7221356	Please find attached our Christmas to you all at OLR.
7221416	7225156	We're not sending analog versions out as we're trying to save the planet.
7226117	7229718	Have a great Christmas and New Year and we'll see you on the other side, whatever that means.
7230458	7233538	That's a very creative idea to do your Christmas cards digitally.
7234039	7235819	So I would like to see some holiday cards.
7235859	7237739	I don't want to say Christmas because that's insensitive.
7238179	7239620	I want Christmas cards!
7241923	7244585	I want it fucking loaded with baby Jesus.
7246125	7247646	Okay, then fine.
7248026	7254350	We would like to get your digital... For this week's mailbag, we would like to challenge you to send us Christmas cards, and they better be about Christmas.
7255876	7257739	And Jesus and Santa and all that stuff.
7257859	7261023	Unless you want to do them about original Christmas.
7261804	7266811	And that's with, you know, Yule Logs burning and candles on trees and druids sacrificing things.
7266931	7267892	Fine, look, whatever.
7267952	7270135	We want your Christmas cards via email this week.
7270335	7271657	So mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
7273802	7276583	and your banners for the PSP website dammit
7294227	7294587	It was.
7294647	7296909	It was very nice and we appreciate it very much.
7297689	7301232	I actually mailed all four real Christmas cards this year.
7302713	7304574	And they were pretty cool.
7305154	7306695	That's it for emails, I think.
7307416	7307796	Is that it?
7308416	7309497	Nope, we got some spam.
7309637	7312279	Fuck you, allconfirm at ebay.com.
7312639	7313260	You shit.
7314521	7314761	Done?
7314941	7315641	Alright, there you go.
7316062	7321065	If you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Back to the gaming news, Loki.
7321977	7322218	All right.
7323440	7324381	Well, let's see here.
7324522	7326665	We've got some other interesting stuff.
7326686	7330252	This is a game that I was playing quite a bit right after it came out.
7330452	7332376	I kind of put it off now since...
7333442	7337104	I have other things to be playing, but I want to go back, and maybe this will entice me.
7338405	7341387	Mercenaries 2 is getting some new download content.
7341947	7350312	They kind of teased this a little bit a while ago with their Obama and Sarah Palin characters.
7350753	7354415	Well, this is all going to be part of the Blow It Up Again download content pack.
7354855	7357277	It is going to be free, and...
7359173	7363754	It is going to contain a bunch of cool stuff, including some new modes.
7364454	7378637	They're going to have four new game types, including there was one that looked like a death race or something like that, and some other fun explosion-based games, which is kind of cool.
7379537	7384598	And apparently it will be coming out on the Marketplace December 16th.
7387017	7387458	PS3 owners
7395478	7406226	Well, if you want to continue to expand games that you might own, Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be offering five free download tracks, but only if you own the guitar bundle of the game.
7406427	7411751	So not buying the game by itself, not buying the big band box, just buying guitar and game by itself.
7411831	7414513	Supposedly you're going to be getting five free songs.
7414533	7417835	And here's the thing, it's not five pre-selected songs like it was a rock band.
7418136	7420478	You'll just get to choose five free downloadable tracks.
7421298	7421718	Thanks for watching!
7441209	7444191	You know what's... I actually almost bought Guitar Hero World Tour.
7444571	7449473	I just... Every song in the song list that I really, really wanted to play was pretty much already in Rock Band.
7449773	7451074	Like, I just... I feel bad.
7451094	7453575	I feel like Rock Band's so much better than Guitar Hero.
7453615	7454996	I mean, it's so much more versatile.
7455376	7457177	It has a lot more tracks to play.
7457557	7460038	We met some real nice people that worked on Guitar Hero at PAX.
7460059	7460839	That is true.
7461199	7465781	But one thing I am... One thing I am excited about, though, is the music mixer.
7466342	7467102	The studio mode.
7467542	7468523	It's limited.
7469083	7469383	Really?
7469543	7469743	Yeah.
7469763	7469923	Yeah.
7471474	7472134	So I don't know.
7474095	7474475	We'll see.
7474535	7476015	Maybe when it comes down in price a little bit.
7476795	7478876	I think the price is one thing I'm having a hard time justifying.
7478916	7480396	I do really need a new guitar, though.
7480736	7482657	In fact, I was playing the No Doubt stuff in Rock Band.
7482677	7485097	Maybe if they get better downloads, too, I'd be on board.
7485997	7488038	No Doubt has that album, right?
7488098	7490839	And my roommate was watching me play it and was like, yeah, it's too bad you don't have a second guitar.
7490859	7492019	I actually want to play Rock Band right now.
7492039	7492559	This is pretty cool.
7493119	7496262	And I'm like, oh, I need to get a second guitar anyway, because I'm still using the Explorer.
7496683	7496963	Still.
7497784	7500906	And TigerClaw says, why buy the game when SingStar ABBA was all you cared for?
7501687	7504930	I can't believe I left that out of my gaming week, but I did play SingStar ABBA last night.
7505631	7506311	It was a lot of fun.
7506792	7507052	Mm-hmm.
7508193	7508533	Yep, yep.
7510035	7510335	There you go.
7512228	7516891	Well, this is definitely for the UK.
7517291	7520933	In February, Rise of the Argonauts is going to be coming out.
7520953	7524875	It's an action roleplay game that's being put out by Codemasters.
7530393	7537714	It's already out on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 everywhere else in Europe.
7537934	7544835	However, the UK version had some problems with actually having space for the game.
7545615	7547335	It really was only a retail issue.
7548596	7556357	The publisher actually said that they tried to get it into retail in the UK along with the others, but it was so busy they could not get it.
7556657	7560580	Do it so they actually delayed the UK launch, simply for retail reasons.
7561401	7568667	It's actually supposed to be out in the US on February 16th, and everybody else as of Friday.
7570589	7570749	Hmm.
7571669	7572050	Alrighty.
7572550	7574292	Cool.
7574992	7575653	Let's see.
7576113	7581097	You may remember back... Man, I can't believe it's already been over a year, but...
7582609	7583309	BioShock.
7583349	7589230	They had some limited editions that came out that had the BioShock Big Daddy figurine with it.
7589870	7593851	Well, now to go with the Big Daddy is a little sister.
7594131	7596832	And you'll actually be able to purchase these.
7596972	7601853	I think they're from the Cult of Rapture.
7602093	7604053	I'm not sure if they're actually being sold through the website or not.
7604553	7609154	But yeah, it's going to be a little sister figurine that will go along with it.
7610135	7610755	That's kind of neat.
7611555	7611695	And
7614232	7615713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7637533	7663310	But what's cool about this, the mobile game actually supports local matches via Bluetooth And, remember the awesome game Pac-Man Versus, and what was so awesome about that, you could play as the ghost You can do that in this mobile version as well Now here's the thing, there is that kind of like fog or limited vision on the mobile phone But, you know what, still kind of awesome So there you go, if you're a mobile gamer and looking for a game to get
7664966	7667675	being able to play as the ghost definitely puts a whole new twist on Pac-Man.
7667915	7671386	So it's available right now in Europe and I'm sure we'll come over here soon.
7672537	7672837	Patience.
7672857	7673057	Patience.
7699099	7699639	It's a virtue.
7700679	7703760	Sadly, I'm not virtuous, but oh well, I have to be because I'm poor.
7704360	7705720	I want it now, daddy.
7706420	7708001	Do you want the goose that lays the golden eggs?
7708061	7709721	I want a goose that lays the golden egg.
7711421	7715542	And it's also a very stressful episode on Wondershowsen.
7716182	7718662	Patience, patience, patience, patience, patience.
7719522	7720923	God, I love Wondershowsen.
7721203	7722603	I'm so sad that show didn't win.
7723243	7724843	Oh, Jamie, you are missing out.
7724883	7728284	Okay, if you're going to make me watch your crappy movie, I'm making you watch Wondershowsen.
7729272	7731214	It is a crappy movie, but it's fun crappy.
7731355	7732956	It's the hot dog highway.
7734398	7735059	Daddy!
7736621	7737322	Mortimer!
7738749	7739810	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7760915	7764656	It will pick up on Wi-Fi signals that are nearby.
7765556	7771058	And based on those Wi-Fi signals, it will kind of create treasures for you to be able to collect.
7771558	7774739	So you can actually walk around different places and find different treasures.
7774819	7776560	It's like a real-life treasure hunt, I guess.
7777300	7786502	You might also remember that, I want to say, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops did something similar to that effect as well.
7786662	7787623	In fact, I think you could...
7789541	7792982	and get different unlockable characters based on Wi-Fi spots.
7793622	7794622	So that's kind of neat.
7795303	7801885	I don't know if I like the fact that I have to walk around to find these Wi-Fi spots, but neat nonetheless.
7806446	7810647	Is this kind of like the whole geocaching thing?
7811047	7814428	Sort of, but not quite as cool.
7814848	7817809	TigerClaw says, I bet the treasures are actually just open Wi-Fi networks.
7820116	7821010	That would be a treasure.
7822889	7828871	Hey, one more story about an announcement, possible announcement coming to Consumer Electronics Show.
7828891	7830011	This could be some big gaming news.
7830071	7830851	It's just a rumor.
7831251	7835932	However, it's coming from a research analyst for the firm Global Equities.
7836552	7842714	Apparently, Microsoft could be unveiling a Zune phone at Consumer Electronics Show.
7843474	7849256	Apparently, the Zune phone, you can guess what it's probably trying to compete with, but it's supposed to have motion enhancement features.
7849296	7850696	It would actually have an accelerometer in it.
7851236	7855278	A large multimedia screen in it and a keyboard, I guess, that is on the screen.
7856539	7870166	Now, of course, the interesting thing about it is that, you know, although nothing is really said about gaming right away, you would think, especially with the way the other big phone is going, and especially because Microsoft has that tie-in to the 360, and they've always talked about that whole live anywhere thing.
7870306	7874308	And they also showed off those downloadable X and A titles to the Zoom.
7874828	7878050	This would be really a great bridge between all that.
7879028	7883192	So especially with, you know, so many community, I mean, the community thing has really exploded out there.
7884153	7891659	And congrats to our buddy Aaron, who appears to still be in the top, like, 15 of the games on the community games amongst all the stuff that's out there right now.
7892380	7896163	Props to him, but that would be very interesting if all these X and Y games could suddenly be playable on the phone.
7896183	7899206	It's like they'd have this huge base of already made things.
7900307	7900928	Excellent idea.
7901748	7902089	We'll see.
7903567	7904108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7929651	7933112	Although I would probably like doing that because it would come in handy sometimes.
7933612	7937153	But it would all depend.
7937493	7946495	Maybe if they made a standalone Zoom player that also played games and you can download stuff, maybe not the phone, then I might be interested in it.
7946575	7950136	But it's not something I'm actually going to purchase as a phone.
7951756	7957898	Arama in chat says, Okay Microsoft, you already have smartphones and pocket PCs, phones that are on the market that's a whole lot better than iPhones.
7958220	7959821	You don't need a damn Zune phone.
7961741	7962181	We'll see.
7963742	7965883	Alright, that does it for stories tonight.
7966223	7967944	We'll get to some last minute stories in just a moment.
7967984	7969884	But we are going to open up the Skype line right now.
7969904	7973746	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7973766	7976327	If you want to call and talk about the show tonight, please give us a call.
7976347	7983670	We're only going to take a couple calls tonight because we want to make sure we have time after the show for the Justin TV thing with Tatsunoko and Capcom.
7983690	7987011	So we're going to try to abbreviate this so we get Loki home on time and not in trouble.
7987671	7989032	and then I just... Well, I appreciate that.
7989072	7989953	We don't need to do that.
7989973	7991134	I don't want to stay up all night either.
7991154	7993015	It's freaking cold in here.
7993155	7994036	It is very cold in here.
7994076	7997539	So, yeah, we're going to just take a couple quick calls while we're waiting for a call.
7997619	7999140	Loki, you want to do some last-minute stories?
7999240	7999440	Yes.
8000541	8003443	There's a weird game that this...
8005034	8005835	3D Oz Funny Band
8026872	8054545	and then also on that there are two sets of keys there's four keys on the bottom and three keys on the top kind of the base of the guitar and you flip the guitar over and there's six drum pads so that's kind of neat and the game itself kind of looks a little bit like you know Guitar Hero or Rock Band but what's kind of cool is the actual board that the notes scroll down is kind of curved so it's like kind of
8055509	8058813	Suck that you can't play drums and guitar at the same time Not without it being very uncomfortable
8075910	8086276	Something else that's coming out, Brutal Legend, of course, was shown off during the Video Game Awards show tonight, and EA is now bringing that game out.
8086776	8103546	Of course, this used to be one of the properties of NVIDIA before they got bought up by Activision, and now EA is putting out yet another game, a little bit different, not going to see Brutal Legend 2010 or something like that, but neat nonetheless.
8105616	8108759	And then we were talking a little bit before about DJ Max Technica.
8108799	8111421	Well, DJ Max Technica is actually coming to the DS.
8112102	8117206	And they're going to be doing a DS game that's going to also have some DSi features as well.
8117246	8121749	It's going to also use the DSi camera and have storage support, which is kind of cool.
8121909	8125552	But very cool to see that this is going to be coming to the DS.
8125713	8127694	I guess it would be perfect since it's a touchscreen game.
8128395	8130977	And the PSP versions have done very well as well.
8132196	8139240	Alright, now we're finally getting calls, because apparently our Skype was on Don't Disturb or something, and I finally figured that out, thanks to a chat comment, and reset it, and now we've got a call.
8139641	8140901	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8141882	8142963	Hello, Orange Launch Radio.
8143463	8143983	It is Jason.
8144443	8146265	I come from the internet.
8146365	8148606	I was getting a little worried that no one was going to call tonight.
8148646	8156571	I was like, that's a little embarrassing, but then I realized... You were online the whole time, ever since you came on to do the, uh, the toss-over with, uh, Bobby.
8156831	8159913	Yeah, I usually turn it off for the first hour and a half that I got lazy tonight.
8161534	8161654	So...
8162401	8163182	Well, what's up, Jason?
8164362	8164983	Oh, not too much.
8165023	8166744	Just chilling in three-degree weather.
8167344	8167864	Just chilling.
8167945	8173308	That's what it feels like here, even though you'd probably kill us if we told you how cold it actually is here.
8173348	8175129	You'd probably be like, you fucking babies.
8176410	8177571	That's okay.
8177931	8182634	This weather would have frozen me if I had still lived in Arizona at the time, so I can definitely understand.
8183074	8184215	47 degrees out, by the way.
8185336	8185656	Whimps.
8186116	8187017	Whimps.
8187877	8189158	That's what a Colorado summer?
8189278	8189958	All right, no, I'm kidding.
8189979	8190539	What's up, Jason?
8190559	8190739	What's up?
8191616	8192036	That's it.
8192076	8193097	That's pretty close, actually.
8195018	8197359	I have had notes open ever since the start of the show.
8197579	8197959	Home.
8198199	8199240	Hooray, home.
8201061	8207604	It's funny because when you said that this was something that was popular in the 90s, all of these memories came fluttering back.
8208605	8211086	There was two things that stood out.
8211826	8215668	One of them was a company called Worlds3D that... I remember Worlds3D.
8217678	8222021	The sad thing is I've never actually used any of these 3D world products back then.
8222462	8223522	I didn't have my own computer.
8223602	8224263	I was young.
8224543	8226345	I didn't know nearly as much as I do now.
8226385	8227225	You know, that kind of stuff.
8228486	8230428	Worlds 3D came out and tried to do this.
8232770	8240636	I don't know if that's what ZDNet, you know, the precursor to Tech TV, if that's what ZDTV spotlighted at one point.
8240997	8243779	But I remember seeing a 3D interface for web browsing.
8244460	8244980	And you know what?
8245763	8247284	It doesn't work.
8248466	8249346	It's slow.
8249607	8252789	We have a great interface for browsing the web.
8252950	8254391	They're called web browsers.
8254771	8256993	It presents everything in a great medium.
8257634	8258534	What a concept.
8260236	8262678	So you think home is just stupid, or what?
8265060	8269124	Bobby had it right, and I've said this to a couple people in the chat room, and I think you even echoed it at the same time.
8270133	8273114	You want to compare it to Second Life, but you can't compare it to Second Life.
8273494	8279355	Second Life is a game in the sense that you have production and you can play other people's production and whatnot.
8279975	8293258	Home is an interface to, I mean, it's an alternative to the XMB, you could say, with the fact that they're trying to integrate partying and game launching and that kind of stuff.
8293338	8298799	Yes, it's a cross-media bar that says, fuck, shit, nah, and fat, you know, all that stuff, you know?
8300131	8301592	Yeah, it's another interface.
8301752	8302292	And you know what?
8302592	8305994	It's slow and it takes forever.
8307274	8308855	And it just doesn't work as well.
8308895	8313717	While that's natural, it doesn't work on the digital mediums.
8313777	8315438	It's not that smart.
8318239	8321181	Well, you said you've been taking notes during the show.
8321201	8322201	What else did you want to comment on?
8322862	8324022	It was just a lot of this.
8324142	8324863	It's kind of funny.
8325683	8327884	Some of the things that Rye pointed out was that
8328427	8329209	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8340117	8341898	That was aggravating.
8341938	8344419	That was the worst thing I've ever seen in a game.
8344479	8349221	Did you know that Prince of Persia is the first PlayStation 3 game I've bought that had to do the installation thing?
8349261	8350721	And it kind of caught me off guard.
8351141	8355363	Like, I was like, whoa, oh, hey, I forgot PS3 games do this.
8355683	8358564	Because all the other PS3 games I have, LittleBigPlanet didn't really do it.
8358724	8360265	And it might have, but I totally didn't notice it.
8360285	8360465	It did.
8360765	8360945	Did it?
8360965	8361445	It's small.
8362185	8363046	I just didn't notice it.
8363086	8364126	I think I was doing something wrong.
8364146	8366207	You notice that there's no more stories about those anymore?
8366387	8367808	It's because every game does it now.
8367988	8368608	Yeah, yeah.
8369028	8371812	I was actually going to say and ask the same thing about LittleBigPlanet.
8371892	8373074	I don't remember an install.
8373555	8375277	It did it, but it's just kind of short.
8375317	8376479	And so is the Prince of Persia one.
8376959	8380104	You'll notice the first time you play the game, it's slow to boot up.
8380444	8382848	And I was like, oh, this shit's installing on my hard drive right now.
8382888	8385712	And sure enough, every time I booted it since then, boop, comes right up.
8386391	8388512	That's just so weird to me.
8388653	8391294	But PC games have done this for years, right?
8391314	8392215	That's a PC!
8393136	8396618	The difference between a PC is that you have to support a lot.
8397038	8402002	In a game console, developers should already know exactly what they need to do.
8403063	8409767	I mean, you can say the same thing for download content, but... I don't know.
8409908	8413310	It just seems really weird in the way that the PC is kind of graying out
8415416	8416537	Let me say this, Jason.
8416597	8418919	To me, it's weird, but it's not a deal-breaker.
8419179	8422101	Like, I can put up with it, especially if it's just once at the beginning of the thing.
8422682	8428646	I would only be more pissed off if it kept happening throughout the whole thing, which it sounds like it happens in Metal Gear Solid 4.
8429367	8436092	And it's funny, because the first time it installs, it takes something like 10 or 20 minutes, I think, if memory serves correctly.
8436624	8457001	and then every additional time it installs it takes about three minutes and I swear to God it's a three minute when we were playing through it and Wright was watching me play when we were playing through it and we would get to these stupid installs I would say it's a three minute Marlboro commercial because Old Snake is sitting there smoking away right in your face for three minutes and nothing else is going on
8457591	8459953	He's just sitting there huffing and puffing.
8460033	8464676	Comment from chat, Legend of Zaku says, Bullshit, PC games installed faster than PS3 games.
8464996	8466057	I got three words for you.
8466477	8467918	Final Fantasy XI.
8469259	8472241	You can't count download time, download patches and updates.
8472281	8474923	Well, even the game itself spawns across like four CDs.
8475243	8475803	It's crazy.
8475823	8476584	I don't even remember.
8476644	8476964	Forget it.
8477044	8477444	It doesn't matter.
8477464	8478185	It's been too long.
8478265	8481947	I understand the point he's trying to make, that some of those PC reinstalls are very long.
8482688	8485870	Anyway, Jason, I got to rush you along because we got to take some more calls.
8485930	8487151	Is there anything else you want to comment on tonight?
8487813	8488113	DarkSakura.com
8505874	8508737	As soon as it's actually flourishing, it's a preview.
8508797	8513501	But Jason, when you open it up to the masses like Sony has, that's not how everybody's going to view it.
8513541	8517524	Because people are going to download this and go, this is home, this is bullshit, and they're not going to look at it again.
8517544	8524950	They shrug it off as the whole beta thing, but... I mean, they pushed it to the cross-media bar.
8524990	8525871	It's right there.
8527732	8528313	Yeah, yeah.
8528743	8531425	It definitely popped up as soon as I found out that it was open for everybody.
8531806	8532086	I don't know.
8532426	8534928	I stand by my comment, but I certainly understand yours.
8535008	8538291	Jason, I think Home is going to be one of those things that's a lot cooler in a year.
8538671	8543075	Just like the PS3 itself, it's not going to realize its potential for a year.
8543975	8544596	That's a good point.
8545457	8550781	Lord knows we didn't buy our PS3 until recently because the library, we didn't care about it.
8551201	8554044	We didn't have a need for Blu-ray, which has also changed now.
8554084	8554984	Blu-ray movies, that is.
8555545	8555745	Yeah.
8556698	8560020	Hey, hey, it's your buddy from New York, Ranma Well, hello, buddy from New York, Ranma, how you doing?
8582384	8583144	I'm pretty good.
8583204	8586186	I was cold earlier, but now I'm happy I'm home.
8586586	8587106	What's on your mind?
8588087	8588627	Not much.
8588787	8596891	I tried to call you guys last week, but since SSJ100MAT told me you guys didn't have the 1-800 number, I had gone to an interesting... Yeah, we had issues last week, sorry.
8597471	8598672	We had issues last week, sorry.
8599892	8601253	Don't we all have issues once in a while?
8601553	8601813	Yes.
8602874	8608557	Yeah, but I had gone to an interesting concert last week and called BlipFest 2008.
8610677	8611017	BlipFestival.org
8643680	8644921	What convinced you to go out to the show?
8646081	8646401	Chip Tunes
8657745	8658085	Yeah, yeah.
8658705	8663407	I don't know if you heard these shows we did live at Penny Arcade Expo, but... I missed those.
8663747	8664728	I wonder if Bobby's listening.
8664768	8665468	He'll say it in chat.
8665488	8671771	But there was a guy that actually came on who did chiptunes with his old school brick Game Boy, and he was pretty rad.
8671791	8674412	I think he came in... And he was playing them, actually.
8675172	8677793	It wouldn't have been the last day, because we weren't there the last day because of our flight.
8677833	8679073	It was the second day.
8679273	8684315	So look for day two of the PAX podcast we did at All Games, and towards the end of the show is when the guy came on.
8684375	8685356	He was pretty awesome.
8686104	8687765	Did you get his name or something like that?
8687865	8690125	I don't remember it off the top of my head, sadly.
8690185	8692106	I know we had it at the time, and I apologize.
8692606	8693686	If Bobby's listening, he'll remember.
8695047	8710431	Yeah, a lot of the performers on stage were actually mixing, and with Game Boys, there was one artist up there, I think his name was Nordliff, or USK, actually had two Game Boys and basically switching back and forth through a mixer.
8711992	8712192	Hmm.
8714144	8717186	You had another group that I saw on Sunday called Starscream.
8717246	8722908	Pretty much what they were doing was you had one person on the Game Boy and another person on drums.
8725690	8727811	It was just like a non-stop dance party or what?
8728471	8729071	Something like that.
8729131	8734034	It turned into like this awesome 8-bit electro rave and...
8736804	8738285	And it was like a lot of crowd surfing.
8738545	8739546	It was just great.
8739686	8741907	It ran an hour late, but it was well worth it.
8742307	8745129	Because my favorite group was on stage, Anamanaguchi.
8745850	8754755	Basically, their background beats is 8-bit NES, and you have one on drums, a lead, a bassist, and another guitarist.
8754775	8756156	I just couldn't remember what his part was.
8757137	8758277	Okay, I actually found it.
8759698	8762180	Of course, somebody in chat says it right, as I find it myself.
8762220	8765742	But his name was Paul Owens, and he's the director of the movie Reformat the Planet.
8766647	8768388	Oh, okay, that artist wasn't there.
8768588	8770809	Okay, but that's, anyway, sorry.
8771009	8774391	When you said chiptunes, I just remember that particular performance was pretty awesome.
8775271	8776172	But I know what you're talking about.
8776632	8780554	This is kind of a big part of how 8-Bit Weapon kind of got their sound.
8781554	8782035	Definitely.
8782075	8782935	I love 8-Bit Weapon.
8783675	8784496	So that's cool.
8784936	8786577	It's funny that this stuff's gotten bigger and bigger.
8788029	8791912	StarScream, Syphus, Nordloaf, and Anamanaguchi How much did this whole thing cost you?
8810600	8811901	Actually, it was $15.
8812021	8814082	It was a four-night event.
8814583	8816123	It's $50 for all four nights.
8816564	8820406	If you paid $60, you get a DVD of Blitz Festival 06.
8821387	8822487	I just went for Sunday.
8822607	8826550	I just picked up the 07 DVD, and I will tell you this.
8826810	8835175	The way they remixed the music on that DVD, even if you have the volume almost near where no one can still hear it, it's still loud, and it's really good.
8835195	8836336	All right.
8836356	8837317	Well, it sounds like you had fun.
8837777	8839378	I wish our phone lines had been open last week.
8840635	8841195	DarkSakura.com
8870575	8873297	The Force is not strong with him, but, you know, a little bit.
8874058	8874318	All right.
8875399	8878622	I'm staring at that screen, and happy fangirl.
8878642	8879562	We'll get to it after the show.
8879762	8882365	Sorry, we've got Tatsunoko vs. Capcom up on the screen now, finally.
8882385	8883165	We're going to get to it soon.
8883666	8885167	Ranma, we've got to let you go, though, so we can get one more call.
8886088	8886288	All right.
8886368	8887849	Can I say one more thing, and then I can get out of here?
8887869	8888169	Of course.
8889650	8891692	Jamie, that song, it's Pitch Black.
8891712	8895175	It's off the MC Frontline album, Secrets from the Future, so you know which one it is.
8895195	8896336	Okay.
8896356	8896516	Okay.
8897028	8897268	Cool.
8897528	8897749	Awesome.
8898349	8898629	Got it.
8899009	8899310	Later.
8899650	8903172	Actually, did you get a chance to check out the new album?
8904853	8907215	I think it's in my roommate's car, but I'll have to check it out soon.
8907435	8908096	Very much worth it.
8909016	8909476	Definitely.
8909817	8910117	All right.
8910517	8910917	Bye, Ranma.
8911638	8911978	Bye.
8912899	8913699	We'll take one more call.
8913719	8918403	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call right now.
8920544	8921425	Any other last-minute stories?
8921445	8921905	Do we get them all?
8922156	8922957	No, we didn't.
8923057	8923578	All right, go ahead.
8924639	8925720	It's music news stuff.
8925820	8928803	Pearl Jam's 10 album is coming to Rock Band in March.
8929223	8932927	That was announced at the Spike VGA.
8933047	8933387	All right.
8942281	8943782	This is like a ripper.
8972509	8973769	Hey, Akadepro, what's on your mind?
8975210	8976770	I'm, uh, well, what is it?
8976970	8983492	I'm, well, as you haven't heard, I'm back in WoW, playing on the US server once again, actually.
8984052	8984953	Congratulations.
8987113	8996996	Oh, well, uh, well, I thought you were going to go off to this, that you can now change your, uh,
8998547	8999228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9017040	9017380	Troll Warlock
9041567	9043268	The interesting... Oh, whatever.
9044348	9047989	The interesting thing is, is that, um... I don't play a warlock, obviously.
9048210	9051451	The other interesting thing is, is that you can change the gender of your character.
9051471	9053612	So you can now give your character a sex change!
9054772	9055092	Whee!
9055172	9055712	Yay!
9056033	9070158	And, well, here's the other thing, is that, well, as one sort of... Well, I don't know if you're supposed to be... But as one cross-dresser sort of like, since I'm not considering myself fully bone-training...
9071470	9074332	I would say, but that doesn't matter.
9074472	9077273	We already play as girls already.
9078974	9083176	Yeah, I play as a tauren female because who plays a tauren female?
9083296	9085497	I'll tell you, nobody plays a tauren female.
9085537	9085857	You do.
9085877	9086698	Yeah, me.
9086978	9088979	And there's probably like five on the entire server.
9088999	9090019	Is this Sassy Pants?
9090119	9090319	Yes.
9091660	9093301	I usually don't give out the character name on the server.
9093341	9094041	Yeah, no, that's fine.
9095802	9096963	I just don't want random tells.
9097023	9098083	No, they can probably find it.
9098123	9098423	It's all right.
9098443	9098784	I don't care.
9099104	9099344	But yeah.
9100914	9104597	I just don't need the random emails of people saying, I looked up a character in the armory and she sucks.
9105518	9108340	Because that would tell me exactly what they could do.
9109941	9110662	But anyway, sorry.
9111442	9113724	I'm in the process of leveling up.
9113864	9117407	Speaking of warlocks, they work warlock.
9118047	9118848	I got to level 30.
9119048	9126814	It's damn nice that you get your mount at level 30 nowadays.
9127669	9128229	Oh, it's amazing.
9128249	9130070	They've made a lot of great changes.
9130190	9132791	One change I really like that they did is that now you have the heirlooms.
9133571	9139913	So if you have a level 80 character and if you save up your badges or wintergrass marks, you can buy these heirlooms and you can send them.
9139953	9146175	They're bind to account, meaning you can send these items to any player on your account and they actually scale in level.
9146635	9156719	And what's cool is that the shoulders heirlooms that you can buy scale in level so you can send them to your level 1 character and they get a 10% experience bonus gain in addition to the pretty awesome stats.
9157239	9161901	So, kind of neat.
9162681	9163582	That seems quite nice.
9164022	9169184	Well, other than that, I have nothing to remark about.
9169884	9173486	Yeah, I should point out, check out Left 4 Dead.
9173646	9175106	It's really nice.
9177127	9177547	Where is this?
9177607	9178007	What is this?
9178928	9179568	Left 4 Dead.
9180228	9180949	Oh, Left 4 Dead.
9181189	9181769	Oh, yeah, yeah.
9182775	9192303	I play, when the demo was released, I got up to play it, but it really is something.
9193063	9206674	The only thing you have to point out is that you really do need four people and all of them need to have mics, else there really isn't any fun.
9208564	9208904	All right.
9208944	9215147	Well, I got to let you go because the chat wants less Warcraft and more Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
9215207	9216647	So we're going to wrap up the show.
9216907	9218828	Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that too.
9219248	9219549	All right.
9219669	9220429	Well, take care, buddy.
9221329	9221769	Yeah, same.
9221949	9222750	Thank you for the call.
9223390	9225411	We enjoy hearing from our listeners from afar.
9225865	9228786	I do have commentary about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
9228806	9229267	Which would be?
9230067	9233268	I like the music that they've put up for the characters.
9233989	9238070	That for Ken, they give him the... Okay, gotcha my history.
9238090	9241792	For the first 13 episodes of the series, it had a more sedate opening.
9242392	9245634	And the da-de-da thing that everyone knows was the closing theme.
9245654	9248715	And then they switched it over because all the fans liked the big one better.
9248955	9253317	So Ken gets that theme, but June gets the original opening, which I thought was pretty funny.
9254178	9259042	And that's it for me being a total Tatsunoko fangirl nerd.
9261265	9266430	And Dan laughed at me because I was singing along with it while I was playing the other day.
9268770	9269150	I was.
9269490	9271351	All right.
9272191	9275113	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up tonight's show.
9275153	9276093	We're at the end of the show.
9277073	9277533	Oh, I'm sorry.
9277553	9278274	I didn't get it.
9278454	9278654	Sorry.
9278674	9278854	Yes.
9278914	9279454	Last minute story.
9279474	9279654	Sorry.
9279674	9280395	No, that's all right.
9280415	9280655	Okay.
9281555	9283096	Back to Guitar Hero Metallica.
9283196	9285356	They have a partial track list out from it now.
9286197	9290999	On top of the Metallica songs, there's going to be some songs from other bands that worked with Metallica and stuff like that.
9291459	9297261	Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Turn the Page, Judas Priest, Hellbent for Leather, and
9298281	9315165	Cyrus with Demon Cleaner, Leonard Skinner with Tuesday's Gone, Mastodon, Blood and Thunder, Michael Sheckler Group, Armed and Ready, Sam Hain, Mother of Mercy, and The Sword, Black River.
9316765	9321706	There's also apparently some unannounced tracks by Slayer, Queen, and The Foo Fighters.
9323047	9326510	I guess this is all coming from the new Game Informer.
9326730	9328071	It's going to have some info on that.
9328531	9330413	Also, the Metallica tracks in there.
9330513	9344765	Enter Sandman, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Fuel, Hit the Lights, King Nothin', Master Puppets, and No Leaf Clovers, Nothing Else Matters, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, and Where I May Roam.
9345966	9346447	Sounds kind of cool.
9347443	9368693	and, um, let's see, some other stuff, download content coming to LittleBigPlanet, including a Santa costume you can get now, it'll be available free on, um, December 18th, and they're gonna have it in two parts, so you can make, uh, your Santa sack boys, and, um...
9369620	9370140	DarkSakura, WhiteShadow
9399810	9401811	because if you know Gatchaman.
9402191	9402511	I don't.
9403991	9407972	Anyway, I forgot the whole stupid speech, so whatever.
9409173	9410613	More Gatchaman, less WoW.
9411693	9413494	My final thought is WoW.
9413754	9419416	No, WoW I love my new, I have a Tanooki suit hoodie that I have now that's awesome.
9419456	9424557	I wore it out last night and I got compliments on it, but the best part about it on the actual hoodie is little cat ears.
9425197	9427698	So you actually look like, I'll go out and get it.
9428306	9429187	Oh, never mind.
9429467	9432070	Yeah, I don't have it out right now, but... I need to find one.
9432090	9436936	I'll wear it out sometime when we go out to not go to the test location of DJ Max Technica.
9437436	9441000	Because, you know, you're like, I gotta go shopping, blah, blah, blah.
9441060	9442262	Let's get some shoes.
9442382	9443223	Let's get some shoes.
9443343	9444144	Loki, your final thought.
9445305	9447027	My final thought is I gotta find Cageman's song.
9447714	9448254	You better hurry.
