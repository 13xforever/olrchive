1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Dream a dream lover, take me in a dream Take me any way you please, boy you're making me scream

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Dream a dream lover, life is just a dream If you wanna set me free, boy you're making me scream

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ooh la da dee, la da da You gotta dream a dream

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wow, so this entire time the microphones have been silenced, cause I'm a moron

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Everybody probably left, no the entire time those mics have been silenced, whoops

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hurry up

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, anyway, if you're still with us, which I hope you are, I wanna give a quick update for the O-L-R-U-S-L

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is really under sedations thing, we don't really do anything but make fun of it

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Top 25 games ever, or the March Madness, or if you wanna say like January Madness, I don't know what you wanna call it

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Madness!

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is Madness! Alright, anyhow, this is the Top 25, let me get my theme music again

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
As it stands today, this is the Top 25 list of games of all time

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:37,000
25 Super GT, 24 Mega Man 9, this is based on your votes, 23 Time Crisis, 22 Bionic Commando Rearmed, 21 Gradius, 20 Ace Attorney, 19 Daytona USA, 18 Beatmania 2DX, 17 Street Fighter 2, 16 La Mulana

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You know that was Dark Tetsuya, 15 Para Para Paradise, 14 Final Fantasy 5, 13 Final Fantasy 7, 12 Castlevania Symphony of the Night, 11 Pop'n Music, 10 Super Mario 3, 9 Tetris Attack, 8 Rock Band, 7 Tetris, 6 DDR, 5 Final Fantasy 6, 4 Super Metroid, 3 A Link to the Past, 2 Ocarina of Time, 1 Chrono Trigger

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now, if you think that this list is bullshit, which is apparently Dark Sakura does, you should send in your list of the Top 25 games ever to uslmadness at gmail.com

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Madness!

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Send in your list and you can rectify this terrible list if you need to

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Rectify

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Rectify, alright, I'm just kidding, it's actually not that bad so far, just these little tinkering, these little tinkering needs some older games in there

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Needs a good potty

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But I haven't sent my list yet, so

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
They need to take Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid off because those games suck

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Those games both suck, both games really bad

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Like your mom

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alright

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Anyhow, uhh

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They need to put more Wii Music on there

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes, I'm getting to the fortune music, I gotta load it

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you guys for staying with us up on this very late hour

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Here on Orange Laundry throughout all our technical difficulties and all that stuff

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Shut up

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hey Rob, br br br br br br br br

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Do you wanna introduce the cookie tonight?

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Cookie!

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
My favorite Christmas memory, when I was growing up, was the uhh

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh god bless you little pixies

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Was the Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas song

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
By the way, this, we can't pay for the rights for this, this will not make it on the album

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So you'll be able to go, oh, I heard bits that aren't even on the fucking CD, man

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's a fucking cool line, they had to cut that thing out

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When I was growing up, my favorite Christmas memory was the Alvin and the Chipmunks album

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Because we had it on LP

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And you know what I'm talking about, the uhh

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Remember that song? Little Chipmunks are singing and there's that guy Dave going

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Alright now Chipmunks, let's all br br br

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
My brother and I had that on an LP, so what we would do is

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We would play that as slow, on the slowest beat possible on the record player

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So then, it sounded like four normal monotone guys

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Just singing this boring Christmas song

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then this demon from like the ninth level of traitors and murderers just screaming at them

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And then it just, it was just so different, it was like

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Christmas, Christmas, time is here

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Time for toys, and time for cheer

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:53,960
okay

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,960
He adores you

56
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Okay

57
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:10,960
How many years have I used to live?

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,960
How many?

59
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,960
NO!

60
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Okay

61
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
That actually was kind of funny

62
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960
I loathed

63
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:37,960
Bye

64
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Bye guys
