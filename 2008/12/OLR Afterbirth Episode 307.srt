1
00:00:01,454 --> 00:00:06,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, so this entire time the microphones have been silenced because I'm a moron.

2
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:34,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody probably left.

3
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:38,473
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the entire time those mics have been silenced.

4
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:38,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.

5
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:41,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurry up.

6
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:51,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway, if you're still with us, which I hope you are, I want to give a quick update for the OLR USL.

7
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:52,703
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really under sedations thing.

8
00:00:52,723 --> 00:00:54,184
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really do anything but make fun of it.

9
00:00:55,225 --> 00:01:00,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Top 25 games ever or the March Madness or if you want to say like January Madness.

10
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:01,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you want to call it.

11
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Madness.

12
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just madness.

13
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,781
[SPEAKER_03]: This is madness!

14
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:07,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

15
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:11,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, this is the top 25.

16
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:13,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get my theme music again.

17
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:20,030
[SPEAKER_03]: As it stands today, this is the top 25 list of games of all time.

[SPEAKER_03]: Where is Portal?

21
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:13,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you think that this list is bullshit, which apparently DarkSakura does, you should send in your list of the top 25 games ever to uslmadness at gmail.com.

22
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:17,347
[SPEAKER_03]: That's U-S-L-M-A-D-N-E-S-S at gmail.com.

23
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:18,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Madness.

24
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Send in your list and you can rectify this terrible list if you need to.

25
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:26,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Rectify.

26
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:28,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Rectify.

27
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:30,056
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

28
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:31,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

29
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:33,288
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually not that bad so far.

30
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:35,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Just needs a little tinkering.

31
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Needs some older games in there.

32
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Needs a good potty.

33
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,669
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't sent my list yet.

34
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:43,310
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to take Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid off because those games suck.

35
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Those games both suck.

36
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Both games suck really bad.

37
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your mom.

38
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:48,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

39
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:49,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

40
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:51,932
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to put more Wii music on there.

41
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm getting to the Forge game music.

42
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:54,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta load it.

43
00:02:55,851 --> 00:03:02,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for staying with us up on this very late hour here on Orange Laundry throughout all our technical difficulties and all that stuff.

44
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:03,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

45
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:05,298
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

46
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:07,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to introduce the cookie tonight?

47
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:08,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookie!

48
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:21,449
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite Christmas memory when I was growing up was the... Oh, God bless you little pixies.

49
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:25,764
[SPEAKER_02]: was the Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas song.

50
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:29,706
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, we can't pay for the rights for this.

51
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:30,987
[SPEAKER_02]: This will not make it on the album.

52
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:35,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll be able to go, oh, I heard bits that aren't even on the fucking CD, man.

53
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,211
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how fucking cool I am.

54
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:38,312
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't cut that thing out.

55
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:45,650
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was growing up, my favorite Christmas memory was the album and the Chipmunks album, because we had it on LP.

56
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:50,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what I'm talking about?

57
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:50,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that song?

58
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:56,383
[SPEAKER_02]: The little Chipmunks are singing it, and then there's that guy Dave going, all right now, Chipmunks, let's all...

59
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:05,950
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother and I had that on an LP, so what we would do is we would play that on the slowest speed possible on the record player.

60
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:13,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it sounded like four normal monotone guys just singing this boring Christmas song.

61
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:21,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this demon from like the ninth level of traitors and murderers just screaming at them.

62
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:33,366
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it just it was so different it was like Christmas Christmas time is here time for toys and time for cheer

63
00:04:53,604 --> 00:04:56,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Theodora, Alvin,

64
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:26,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

65
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,501
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually was kind of funny.

66
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:36,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I lulled.

67
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:37,982
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

68
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:39,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, guys.

69
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:43,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for tuning in and staying with us up very late here on this Sunday evening.

70
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, stay tuned to All Games Radio.
