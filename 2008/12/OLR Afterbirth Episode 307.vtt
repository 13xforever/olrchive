00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Dream a dream lover, take me in a dream Take me any way you please, boy you're making me scream

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
Dream a dream lover, life is just a dream If you wanna set me free, boy you're making me scream

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Ooh la da dee, la da da You gotta dream a dream

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
Wow, so this entire time the microphones have been silenced, cause I'm a moron

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
Everybody probably left, no the entire time those mics have been silenced, whoops

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Hurry up

00:42.000 --> 00:51.000
Okay, anyway, if you're still with us, which I hope you are, I wanna give a quick update for the O-L-R-U-S-L

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
This is really under sedations thing, we don't really do anything but make fun of it

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
Top 25 games ever, or the March Madness, or if you wanna say like January Madness, I don't know what you wanna call it

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Madness!

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
This is Madness! Alright, anyhow, this is the Top 25, let me get my theme music again

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
As it stands today, this is the Top 25 list of games of all time

01:20.000 --> 01:37.000
25 Super GT, 24 Mega Man 9, this is based on your votes, 23 Time Crisis, 22 Bionic Commando Rearmed, 21 Gradius, 20 Ace Attorney, 19 Daytona USA, 18 Beatmania 2DX, 17 Street Fighter 2, 16 La Mulana

01:37.000 --> 02:02.000
You know that was Dark Tetsuya, 15 Para Para Paradise, 14 Final Fantasy 5, 13 Final Fantasy 7, 12 Castlevania Symphony of the Night, 11 Pop'n Music, 10 Super Mario 3, 9 Tetris Attack, 8 Rock Band, 7 Tetris, 6 DDR, 5 Final Fantasy 6, 4 Super Metroid, 3 A Link to the Past, 2 Ocarina of Time, 1 Chrono Trigger

02:02.000 --> 02:17.000
Now, if you think that this list is bullshit, which is apparently Dark Sakura does, you should send in your list of the Top 25 games ever to uslmadness at gmail.com

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Madness!

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Send in your list and you can rectify this terrible list if you need to

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Rectify

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
Rectify, alright, I'm just kidding, it's actually not that bad so far, just these little tinkering, these little tinkering needs some older games in there

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Needs a good potty

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But I haven't sent my list yet, so

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
They need to take Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid off because those games suck

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Those games both suck, both games really bad

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Like your mom

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Alright

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Anyhow, uhh

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
They need to put more Wii Music on there

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Yes, I'm getting to the fortune music, I gotta load it

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Thank you guys for staying with us up on this very late hour

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Here on Orange Laundry throughout all our technical difficulties and all that stuff

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Shut up

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Hey Rob, br br br br br br br br

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Do you wanna introduce the cookie tonight?

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Cookie!

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
My favorite Christmas memory, when I was growing up, was the uhh

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Oh god bless you little pixies

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Was the Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas song

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
By the way, this, we can't pay for the rights for this, this will not make it on the album

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
So you'll be able to go, oh, I heard bits that aren't even on the fucking CD, man

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
It's a fucking cool line, they had to cut that thing out

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
When I was growing up, my favorite Christmas memory was the Alvin and the Chipmunks album

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Because we had it on LP

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And you know what I'm talking about, the uhh

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
Remember that song? Little Chipmunks are singing and there's that guy Dave going

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Alright now Chipmunks, let's all br br br

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
My brother and I had that on an LP, so what we would do is

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
We would play that as slow, on the slowest beat possible on the record player

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
So then, it sounded like four normal monotone guys

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Just singing this boring Christmas song

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
And then this demon from like the ninth level of traitors and murderers just screaming at them

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
And then it just, it was just so different, it was like

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Christmas, Christmas, time is here

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Time for toys, and time for cheer

04:33.000 --> 04:53.960
okay

04:53.960 --> 04:58.960
He adores you

05:00.960 --> 05:01.960
Okay

05:02.960 --> 05:10.960
How many years have I used to live?

05:13.960 --> 05:17.960
How many?

05:17.960 --> 05:24.960
NO!

05:25.960 --> 05:26.960
Okay

05:33.960 --> 05:35.960
That actually was kind of funny

05:35.960 --> 05:37.960
I loathed

05:37.960 --> 05:37.960
Bye

05:37.960 --> 05:38.960
Bye guys

05:38.960 --> 05:42.960
