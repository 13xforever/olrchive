00:01.454 --> 00:06.998
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, so this entire time the microphones have been silenced because I'm a moron.

00:33.689 --> 00:34.910
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody probably left.

00:36.171 --> 00:38.473
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the entire time those mics have been silenced.

00:38.633 --> 00:38.953
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.

00:40.714 --> 00:41.595
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurry up.

00:43.576 --> 00:51.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway, if you're still with us, which I hope you are, I want to give a quick update for the OLR USL.

00:51.402 --> 00:52.703
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really under sedations thing.

00:52.723 --> 00:54.184
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really do anything but make fun of it.

00:55.225 --> 01:00.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Top 25 games ever or the March Madness or if you want to say like January Madness.

01:00.849 --> 01:01.690
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you want to call it.

01:01.710 --> 01:02.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Madness.

01:03.479 --> 01:04.280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just madness.

01:04.340 --> 01:05.781
[SPEAKER_03]: This is madness!

01:07.081 --> 01:07.342
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:07.902 --> 01:11.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, this is the top 25.

01:12.345 --> 01:13.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get my theme music again.

01:15.947 --> 01:20.030

02:03.158 --> 02:13.905
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you think that this list is bullshit, which apparently DarkSakura does, you should send in your list of the top 25 games ever to uslmadness at gmail.com.

02:13.945 --> 02:17.347
[SPEAKER_03]: That's U-S-L-M-A-D-N-E-S-S at gmail.com.

02:17.768 --> 02:18.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Madness.

02:21.070 --> 02:25.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Send in your list and you can rectify this terrible list if you need to.

02:26.193 --> 02:26.994
[SPEAKER_01]: Rectify.

02:28.235 --> 02:28.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Rectify.

02:29.736 --> 02:30.056
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:31.127 --> 02:31.707
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

02:31.747 --> 02:33.288
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually not that bad so far.

02:33.308 --> 02:35.548
[SPEAKER_03]: Just needs a little tinkering.

02:35.588 --> 02:36.808
[SPEAKER_03]: Needs some older games in there.

02:36.848 --> 02:38.189
[SPEAKER_01]: Needs a good potty.

02:38.329 --> 02:39.669
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't sent my list yet.

02:39.709 --> 02:43.310
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to take Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid off because those games suck.

02:43.370 --> 02:44.530
[SPEAKER_03]: Those games both suck.

02:44.610 --> 02:45.891
[SPEAKER_00]: Both games suck really bad.

02:46.091 --> 02:47.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your mom.

02:47.731 --> 02:48.591
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:49.352 --> 02:49.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

02:50.152 --> 02:51.932
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to put more Wii music on there.

02:52.572 --> 02:53.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm getting to the Forge game music.

02:53.853 --> 02:54.553
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta load it.

02:55.851 --> 03:02.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for staying with us up on this very late hour here on Orange Laundry throughout all our technical difficulties and all that stuff.

03:02.856 --> 03:03.336
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

03:04.337 --> 03:05.298
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

03:06.378 --> 03:07.759
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to introduce the cookie tonight?

03:07.959 --> 03:08.420
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookie!

03:12.342 --> 03:21.449
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite Christmas memory when I was growing up was the... Oh, God bless you little pixies.

03:23.442 --> 03:25.764
[SPEAKER_02]: was the Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas song.

03:27.305 --> 03:29.706
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, we can't pay for the rights for this.

03:29.726 --> 03:30.987
[SPEAKER_02]: This will not make it on the album.

03:31.267 --> 03:35.290
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll be able to go, oh, I heard bits that aren't even on the fucking CD, man.

03:35.990 --> 03:37.211
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how fucking cool I am.

03:37.231 --> 03:38.312
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't cut that thing out.

03:39.943 --> 03:45.650
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was growing up, my favorite Christmas memory was the album and the Chipmunks album, because we had it on LP.

03:46.151 --> 03:50.195
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what I'm talking about?

03:50.215 --> 03:50.876
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that song?

03:51.297 --> 03:56.383
[SPEAKER_02]: The little Chipmunks are singing it, and then there's that guy Dave going, all right now, Chipmunks, let's all...

03:58.447 --> 04:05.950
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother and I had that on an LP, so what we would do is we would play that on the slowest speed possible on the record player.

04:06.510 --> 04:13.153
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it sounded like four normal monotone guys just singing this boring Christmas song.

04:13.513 --> 04:21.677
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this demon from like the ninth level of traitors and murderers just screaming at them.

04:23.502 --> 04:33.366
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it just it was so different it was like Christmas Christmas time is here time for toys and time for cheer

04:53.604 --> 04:56.425
[SPEAKER_01]: Theodora, Alvin,

05:26.355 --> 05:26.995
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.501
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually was kind of funny.

05:36.581 --> 05:36.922
[SPEAKER_03]: I lulled.

05:37.742 --> 05:37.982
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

05:39.323 --> 05:39.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, guys.

05:40.164 --> 05:43.526
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for tuning in and staying with us up very late here on this Sunday evening.

05:43.566 --> 05:45.007
