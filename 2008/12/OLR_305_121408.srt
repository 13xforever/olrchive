Sj100Matt says Shaq Fu versus Capcom.

00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,240
Alright guys, that's enough.

31
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,000
That's enough versus Capcom jokes.

32
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm done.

33
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,240
Anything else you've been playing this week, Loki?

34
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,420
Grand Theft Auto IV on PC, and it's still, it's weird, because I tried upgrading the

35
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,760
RAM on my PC to four gigs, even though Windows can only see, like, two of it, but I was going

36
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,800
to do it anyways, and I had a bad run with bad RAM from Fry's.

37
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,240
Apparently, Fry's, they keep taking back, my defective RAM is just a stock return, and

38
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,640
so they have, like, four that they keep swapping out, even though it's defective.

39
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,680
So I stopped buying RAM there, because it's pointless, and it would have been too much

40
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,080
of a pain in the ass to get, you know, to see it on my computer.

41
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,320
So and that's being said, yeah, I haven't really been playing too much of Grand Theft

42
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,640
Auto IV, since it's still kind of buggy, even though they patched it a little bit to fix

43
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,880
some stuff, it's not enough, it doesn't support SLI yet, and that kind of pisses me off, because

44
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,560
that's, you know, I spent the money for an extra video card, I want the games to fucking

45
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,320
see it, and I mean, come on, it's like a standard nowadays, it's just lazy, damn lazy is what

46
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
it is.

47
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,720
Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, then my gaming week, kind of a lot of

48
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,360
the same usual stuff, I've obviously been playing a lot of The Wrath of the Lich King,

49
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,520
I have done a big, big thing in WoW this week, I respect for a long term basis, because we're

50
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,560
so short on healers, just on the server in general, not just our guild, but the server,

51
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,360
I'm no longer a boomkin, but I'm now a resto tree druid, and it's been a whole different

52
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,000
game trying to play it as a healer, but I won't bore you with the specifics, and I think

53
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,640
we have a WoW story coming up later.

54
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,040
Also some other things I've been playing, some old standbys, Rock Band 2, I downloaded

55
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,720
the new No Doubt album, because I like fun pop music, and then, you know, the nice thing

56
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,240
I like about the album they picked by No Doubt is that they just picked the greatest hits

57
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,000
album, so you don't have a lot of, you know, songs that you don't really know, and that's

58
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,480
the problem with some of these album songs, is that in a party setting, they don't work

59
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,400
very well, because you don't really know the songs, usually, that weren't, you know, the

60
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,440
radio hits, but the cool thing is the No Doubt album, like, it's all songs you'd probably

61
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,600
recognize if you listened to the radio in the 90s and early 2000s at all.

62
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,560
So I had fun with that.

63
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,640
I checked out Meteos Wars, I only checked out the demo, so I don't want to really review

64
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,520
a full game based strictly off the demo.

65
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,240
Graphics were a little minimalist in the stage I played, however, it's a fairly faithful

66
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
translation.

67
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,960
I was wondering how you would have the speed of the stylus in a game like Meteos Wars,

68
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,480
but the way they did it was kind of neat.

69
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,160
Instead of sliding the pieces up and down, you use triangle to move a piece up a row

70
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,640
really fast, and you use, what, X, I'm sorry, triangles would be a PlayStation, I'm sorry,

71
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Y.

72
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,760
You use Y to move a thing up really fast, you use A to move it down really fast.

73
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,520
So that I thought was a neat way to control it, and it actually made the game pretty playable,

74
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,360
but it's so different looking at it on a TV than having the pen in front of you, like,

75
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,320
you really have to think about the game a different way.

76
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
But it was fun.

77
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,500
I probably will buy the full version a little later on, especially now that I finally got

78
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,180
a bigger hard drive for the Xbox 360, I finally am replacing my 20 gig with a 120 gig drive

79
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,200
after all this time, so I can rip some of my games to the drive.

80
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,300
As far as other new games go, I did spend a little bit more time with Prince of Persia

81
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,560
on the PlayStation 3.

82
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,080
This is the brand new one by Ubisoft.

83
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,440
It's very famous because it's kind of, I would say it's kind of left the old Prince of Persia

84
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,560
games, like the Sands of Time, and look at those games behind, and now they have this

85
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,880
more cel-shaded, I guess you could say like Okami type of art style going on.

86
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,600
I don't know what you'd really call that, but it's a very different art style.

87
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,920
And you know, I'm not usually a big fan of these platformer games.

88
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,080
I actually really like Prince of Persia, I've had a lot of fun with it.

89
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,480
I've kind of kept playing it, it's kind of held my interest.

90
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,320
The scripting in the game is a little silly, but it's, you know what I mean, like it's

91
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,800
got a silly sense of humor, but it's funny, you know, I don't know if you, did you play

92
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
much of the game at all?

93
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I haven't played it at all yet.

94
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,120
It's cheesy but good, you know, for a video game.

95
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:47,800
And yeah, the thing I like about it so far is that it really does help out idiots like

96
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,120
me in platformer games, because I'm really horrible at these 3D platformer games, you

97
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
know?

98
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,520
I grew up in a day where it was all 2D, you know, Mario Brothers, Super Mario World, and

99
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,280
all this, and even the old school Prince of Persia is 2D, it's taken me a long time to

100
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,480
really get used to 3D.

101
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,400
I even still have problems with Mario 64, ok?

102
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,720
But the thing I like about Prince of Persia is that they've done things in this game that

103
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,880
make it really accessible to noobs, because like, the game really holds your hand for

104
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,840
a long time.

105
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,760
And what I also like about it is that even if you fall off a cliff, you don't really

106
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
die.

107
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,840
You have the chick as a crutch to kind of save you.

108
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,560
And you know, I think a lot of hardcore gamers have been really turned off by that, but for

109
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,360
me, I've kind of appreciated it, and it's kind of made me want to continue to play,

110
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,240
because I don't lose massive amounts of time, because I don't know how to turn the freaking

111
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
camera.

112
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,800
And that's what Tigerclaw says, says, Sky, what about the fact that you cannot die in

113
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,280
the game?

114
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,640
You know, I suppose you have to kind of take that with a give and take.

115
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,520
Again, for someone like me who gets really frustrated when I have to go all the way back

116
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,080
in a game, I kind of like that fact.

117
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,240
But I do realize, you know, the other side of it, that there's the challenge people that

118
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,080
say, well, where's the challenge in it if you don't die, if you don't ever die?

119
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,160
And I don't know, progress still feels a lot like challenge to me.

120
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,120
You have to collect things, and you don't have to collect everything, you get light

121
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
seeds.

122
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,560
And you don't have to collect them all to progress to new areas, but you get a sense

123
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,840
of accomplishment for collecting them all, so they've done other little things with it.

124
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,360
I kind of enjoy it.

125
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,920
I would recommend folks check it out.

126
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,200
I thought kind of the fighting was fun, even though it was a lot of button mashing, but

127
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,440
it's kind of cool tricks.

128
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,480
And you know, my roommate and his partner, who neither one of them really play games,

129
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,040
they were kind of watching me play Prince of Persia, and kind of like, oh, what's this?

130
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
Oh, this looks neat.

131
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,920
What is this you're doing?

132
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,840
So it's kind of fun.

133
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,380
Achievements are really, really easy, though, too, I noticed, at least, or the trophies

134
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,380
or whatever.

135
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,960
I noticed I unlocked a silver trophy really easy.

136
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,520
I didn't have to do hardly anything, so kind of interesting.

137
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,000
So that was pretty much it for new games I played this week.

138
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,360
I'm hoping that I'll probably actually play Prince of Persia a lot more, try to play through

139
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
the collision.

140
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,320
They thought it was a Final Fantasy game, and I'm like, no, there's no, you know.

141
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,520
I was going to ask you, did you try out Home?

142
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Did I try what?

143
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Home.

144
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,800
Yes, I did try Sony Home.

145
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,400
I did download Home.

146
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,340
I played that for a little bit.

147
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:28,200
You know, Home is one of those things that I think it was a really great idea, but this

148
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,800
execution that we're seeing of it is kind of not that great.

149
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
You know what I mean?

150
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,900
Like, God, if you think Xbox Live is bad, the minute I logged into Home, I just started

151
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,880
hearing every naughty word in the book.

152
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,760
Just everything you'd hear on Xbox Live.

153
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,200
I didn't even know that you could use microphones on Sony Home, but apparently you can.

154
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,400
So yeah.

155
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
I don't know.

156
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,060
And again, it was also one of those things where it kind of caused the non-game playing

157
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,720
people who come through this house to kind of look at the TV and go, what is this?

158
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
This looks kind of neat.

159
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,340
Like, they were watching me in the bowling alley, and all this stuff in the bowling alley

160
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
is really stupid.

161
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,440
Like, I tried playing one of the games in there, which was basically an overdone version

162
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,560
of Breakout, you know, like just a redone version of that, but it's all free, you have

163
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,960
to remember, so you can't expect that it's going to be anything that great, because they're

164
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,680
going to nickel and dime you, like they're trying to do with the costumes and everything.

165
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,600
This all being said, I do think there's potential here for something cool.

166
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Like I think there is, like, networking potential within Home.

167
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm kind of excited for the clubhouses to come out, because I would like for us to have

168
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,600
like an OLR clubhouse, where we could boot idiots and things like that, and I think we

169
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,120
could have a lot of fun with it.

170
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,760
Here's my thing.

171
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,040
Right now, it's just this clusterfuck of strangeness.

172
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,320
I mean, honestly, it's what it is.

173
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
I don't know how else to explain it.

174
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,400
Now, do you think it's fair for them to be advertising this as like a feature of the

175
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,080
PlayStation 3, since it is only in beta right now?

176
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,240
I mean, they've been having it in commercials since, what, last year?

177
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,520
I mean, I think that's kind of unfair.

178
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,720
I will answer that question, but let me address this, because I got a private message, like,

179
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
what is Home?

180
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,880
Those of us that aren't as familiar with this, basically, Home is like a virtual world, and

181
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,760
these types of things were especially big back in the late 90s, and then kind of caught

182
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,520
a second wind with Second Life, but like when the whole virtual reality thing first came

183
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,180
out, they used to have these chat programs, where you could be like a little virtual avatar,

184
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,480
and you walk around a virtual world, and then, you know, Second Life kind of really took

185
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,160
that to the next level on the PCs.

186
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,840
Well, this is kind of Sony's version of Second Life, where you create a little version of

187
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
yourself.

188
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,960
You know, you can think of me, I guess, but it's a lot more realistic, and you literally,

189
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,440
using your controllers, walk around an open area, where there's other people dancing,

190
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,920
or talking, or interacting with each other, but then you can go into, like, a bowling

191
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,040
alley, and you can walk up to a bowling machine, if they're not all full, which they usually

192
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,260
are, and play bowling with other people, and interact with them that way, or you can walk

193
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
up to an arcade machine.

194
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,040
So it's kind of like, you know, it's like a virtual life.

195
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,320
So it's kind of like a game, but it's not.

196
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,640
I don't know if that makes any sense at all.

197
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,160
It's their idea to try and, of a new networking thing.

198
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
So.

199
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,160
VXJSnacksV in chat says, Second Life is a construct.

200
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Home is a construct.

201
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
All right.

202
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
So now, what was your question?

203
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,280
Home, is it fair to advertise it?

204
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,600
Yeah.

205
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,880
It's obvious that Sony wanted to do a lot more with this.

206
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,920
It's not implemented yet.

207
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,560
I'm not sure what's taken them so long, but maybe it's just like, again, it's one of those

208
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,000
things where the ideas are coming faster than the reality of being able to program it in.

209
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So is it?

210
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
I mean, technically, yeah, they can advertise it.

211
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,480
I would equate it to when they advertise video games with nothing but the cut scenes from

212
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
the game.

213
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Yeah.

214
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,360
But that's basically, it's kind of the equivalent of that.

215
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
To me.

216
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,240
I mean, it's not, it's giving a little bit of a misinterpretation, but it's not anything

217
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,760
anyone's already done, if that makes sense.

218
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Okay.

219
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
So.

220
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
What about you?

221
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Have you played Home at all?

222
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
No.

223
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
From what you've read about it.

224
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,880
Honestly, if you've read about it online, you've probably gotten a pretty good sense

225
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,240
of what it's all about.

226
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Honestly.

227
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Yeah.

228
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Do you think it's fair for them to use it in advertising?

229
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
No.

230
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I don't.

231
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
It's in beta.

232
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
It's not even done.

233
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
It's, to me, I mean.

234
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Isn't Gmail still in beta?

235
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Yeah.

236
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
But it's functional.

237
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,760
This, I would say, it's close to being functional, but it's not, it'd be like putting out a demo

238
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,200
of a game or something like that, and then advertising that in a commercial for, like,

239
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,240
you know, the PlayStation or something like that, like, play Killzone 2, oh, except it's

240
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
not out.

241
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,480
It's just a demo or something like that.

242
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
I don't know.

243
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
It's misleading.

244
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,720
Not that anyone really gives a crap about, you know, their commercials, since, I mean,

245
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,480
I think the sales number speaks for themselves, so, whatever.

246
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,020
I just think it's kind of misleading.

247
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,880
I think there's potential in Home, but it has yet to be unlocked.

248
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,440
Also, the only other thing I want to say about Home is that it's a little confusing.

249
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,640
I mean, the things about the Xbox and the, well, especially the Nintendo one, those are

250
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,240
very easy to just kind of pop into and go, and, you know, obviously neither system has

251
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,920
done something as ambitious as Home, but Home's kind of complicated.

252
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,720
Like, it took me a minute to really kind of work through the menus and everything, and

253
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,400
it really is, it's even more tough when not everything's available yet.

254
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,680
That's the other kind of bummer about it.

255
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,160
And Jason wants to correct that Gmail is no longer in beta.

256
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Gmail is official.

257
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Gmail Labs is beta add-ons.

258
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,560
So there you go.

259
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Interesting comments from Chad.

260
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,200
SSJ100Matt says, it's like calling Windows 3.1.1 a game.

261
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,840
Yeah, I know.

262
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,720
Home isn't really a game.

263
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,080
It's like folding at home is not really a game either.

264
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
It's a simulation.

265
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
Yeah, it's a thing.

266
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,240
No, I guess you could say it's a simulation.

267
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,960
I don't know.

268
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,360
So, all right, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping

269
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,640
real quick, of which we don't have a whole lot of tonight.

270
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,280
Just, you know, always check us out on MySpace at Orange Launch Radio or Facebook at the

271
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
OL Army.

272
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,840
Our Twitter is OLR.

273
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,800
We're also on LiveJournal, Community Orange Lounge, and we always try to keep you updated.

274
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,160
Today and on Latest and Greatest, although it's been kind of a busy past few months,

275
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,840
so a lot of our internet presence has really slowed down, so sorry about that.

276
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,800
But we're still trying to keep you going with the show and do what we always do, and hopefully

277
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,600
2009 will be a little better.

278
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Maybe it'll be warmer.

279
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,960
Oh, also, one thing you've got to see at home is that when you go into the theater, you

280
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,320
just get to see an extended Twilight trailer playing on the screen over and over and over

281
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
again.

282
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,040
I haven't seen it, nor probably will I.

283
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,200
It's very Mystery Science 3000-able.

284
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
That would be funny.

285
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,160
That's the type of stuff they should be using home for.

286
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,600
See, that's why I say there's potential there.

287
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,920
That doesn't necessarily mean Sony's going to ever unlock it.

288
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
I'm just saying.

289
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
There's potential.

290
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
All right.

291
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
All right.

292
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,200
Let's get into some gaming news.

293
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,920
Loki, start us off.

294
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,680
Yes, speaking of Sony, Sony has been seeing some hard times, and they're actually cutting

295
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,600
plants and, with that, slashing 8,000 jobs.

296
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,280
This is all supposed to happen between now and April of 2010, and Sony will cut about

297
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:18,920
5% of their electronics divisions and close a tenth of its manufacturing sites.

298
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,360
That's not good, especially in this tough economy.

299
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,560
But, hmm.

300
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
That's kind of sad.

301
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,560
I mean, is it just because PS3s haven't been selling well, or is it that now they don't

302
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,480
need these people because the PS3's already out, or what?

303
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,600
I think it's just because they haven't been selling well, because there's no need to have

304
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,040
these extra plants producing more systems if they're not selling out.

305
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,080
They're not having an issue with selling out at all.

306
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,760
Although they are, at times, hard to find, just because they keep phasing out skews left

307
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
and right.

308
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
I mean, crap.

309
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,480
I mean, this year alone, there's been four different skews for the PS3.

310
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,200
I mean, that's kind of crazy right there.

311
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,120
Well, that's four new skews, and that's not even including the ones that we came in this

312
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,320
year with.

313
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,760
I don't know.

314
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,080
This is kind of related, but it kind of goes back to what we were talking about with Home.

315
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,040
I really want to read this comment, because it's interesting.

316
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,640
Frisbee says in chat, the Dark Knight DVD has an MST3K feature in it, and Tiger Claw

317
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,280
says, kind of fills that out a little bit, says, actually, the Blu-ray version of the

318
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,400
Dark Knight has a BD Live feature that allows you to do fan commentaries using a webcam

319
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,840
with a PS3.

320
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,400
Once you finish the commentary, it gets uploaded to the servers for others to be able to watch

321
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,000
the movie with.

322
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,260
That's kind of strange.

323
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,360
It's neat.

324
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,480
That's kind of cool with the whole BD Live thing.

325
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,680
So I mean, that's...

326
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,320
I haven't really watched any Blu-rays that have the BD Live.

327
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,280
You know, one thing I did watch, though, was on Netflix.

328
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
I watched King of Kong this week.

329
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Finally.

330
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
God, how long has that movie been out?

331
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Like a year.

332
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,360
I finally watched King of Kong this week, which is in HD on the Netflix thing on 360,

333
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,000
which I thought was pretty cool.

334
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,580
And wow.

335
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,420
What an interesting movie.

336
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,520
That's really the only word I can use to describe it as interesting.

337
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,280
Certain people are kind of dicks.

338
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,480
The drama is still playing out.

339
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,280
Here's the thing, though.

340
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,080
God, how far do I want to get into this on the show?

341
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,300
Especially when we were just talking about something completely different, and I apologize.

342
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,320
It's very sad that people lost their jobs, but unfortunately we don't know much more

343
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,680
than that at this time about it.

344
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,120
So here we are on this whole other subject.

345
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,440
You gotta kind of wonder, like with this movie, how biased is it trying to be?

346
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,720
And I'm not trying to say that Billy Mitchell is not likely the pompous ass he made himself

347
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,280
to be in the movie, but I don't know.

348
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,860
There's something about it.

349
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,400
Something about the fact that they had all these cameras in just the right places at

350
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,560
just the right times when all these things were going on.

351
00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:01,720
There's something about it that says there's some type of editing stuff going on here.

352
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
I don't know.

353
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,600
But then at the same time, I know a lot of our folks listen to the other shows on All

354
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,040
Games, and you've probably heard all this crap about the Twin Galaxies and Mr. Awesome's

355
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,760
been on All Games off and on throughout the years, and all this crap going on with Twin

356
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Galaxies.

357
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,400
And it just kind of goes to show you, this drama has been going on for years and is continuing

358
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,720
even still today.

359
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,960
Not just with Donkey Kong, but with the official scores in general.

360
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,000
And it's just kind of, I don't know, it's a very ambitious topic.

361
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,880
But again, my roommate who doesn't play a lot of games watched most of the movie with

362
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
me.

363
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,720
He kind of had his head in his laptop when he was watching the movie, and he was just

364
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,240
kind of like, all of these people are sad.

365
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
These people are all sad.

366
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,800
And I'm kind of like, well, wait a minute, though.

367
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,080
He's like, well, not the Steve Weeby guy seems pretty cool or whatever, and his family's

368
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
pretty funny.

369
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,040
But most of the people in the movie are very sad individuals, like Billy and his lackeys

370
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,440
and all that stuff.

371
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
And I'm kind of like, well...

372
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,760
But Billy Mitchell actually owns his own business and makes his...

373
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,040
I'm saying he's still an ass, but he's a successful businessman.

374
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,080
Yeah, it's interesting.

375
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,840
Petty, yes.

376
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
He's petty.

377
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
That's a good word.

378
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
That's a good word.

379
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,360
But successful and not stupid.

380
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,840
Like the whole thing where he sends a tape in.

381
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,120
Did you see the movie?

382
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Several times.

383
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Okay, he sends the tape in.

384
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,200
The King of Kong was a very good movie.

385
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,880
He sent the tape in and all this stuff.

386
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,000
Like, did you notice, they have a camera at his house when he sends in the tape.

387
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
They have a camera there.

388
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,800
They have the camera with Grandma at the airport.

389
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,040
I'm kind of like, this seems all way too pre-planned for me.

390
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,580
That was the only problem I had with the movie, is it seemed...

391
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:43,280
This documentary was really well done.

392
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,320
Like almost too well done.

393
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I don't know.

394
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
It was weird.

395
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:58,360
Well, I also do see him as being rather pompous enough to want to tape everything.

396
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
But here's the thing.

397
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Here's what I was going to say.

398
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,000
And this is what I was kind of going to tell my roommate about too.

399
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,440
You see these kind of pompous asses in lots of sports.

400
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,560
Like you ever watch some of these football press conferences or wrestling or boxing?

401
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,960
I mean, some of us cheer on these pompous assholes in wrestling.

402
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,120
You know what I mean?

403
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,340
So in a way, I don't hate the guy or, you know, I do kind of, you know, he did come

404
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,720
off like a pompous ass in the movie, but you know, maybe there's more to him than that.

405
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
I don't know.

406
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Just interesting.

407
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
It's...

408
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Yeah.

409
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,280
And then you look at some of these side stories going on.

410
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,240
Like the whole, like, you know, Mr. Awesome Missile Command.

411
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,160
I never realized, I never, and keep in mind, I've been watching this whole thing play out

412
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
on all games.

413
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,240
I never realized that he had the direct impact on that movie by sending the guy the Donkey

414
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,320
Kong board that he did.

415
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,640
And just to kind of see, like literally, I was just kind of like, wow, a lot of this

416
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,400
makes sense now, what I've been hearing on all games.

417
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,840
Like damn, these people and their drama over scores, but I don't know.

418
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,280
It's all they've got.

419
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
I...

420
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
It's...

421
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
I know, I know.

422
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
I don't fault them for it.

423
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
I don't think they're sad people.

424
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,840
It's what they're into.

425
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
You know, it's...

426
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
I think it's just...

427
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Oh.

428
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
I don't know.

429
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
It hurts my head to think about it.

430
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
It almost like makes you wonder.

431
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,160
It's like, okay, so say you have it.

432
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,520
And you know who I blame even more to?

433
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,400
It's the fucking Guinness Book of World Records, because they're not helping things.

434
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,960
Now putting out this stupid gaming book and stuff.

435
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,200
They're just egging it on.

436
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,260
And not only that, but they have stupid, you know, records in there, like people that claim

437
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,480
to have the highest score in DDR, a game that I don't think that you can have a high score

438
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
in.

439
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
It's just...

440
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
I don't know.

441
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
It's so subjective.

442
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,840
Forgive my ignorance here.

443
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
I don't know.

444
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,100
I plain don't know the answer to this.

445
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Maybe the chat does.

446
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,440
Does anyone audit Twin Galaxies?

447
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,360
That's the only kind of thing I had with them, is that, you know, yes, you know, they talk

448
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,320
about integrity and all this, but obviously the movie showed questionable integrity on

449
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,540
the part of Twin Galaxies, whether that was creative editing or not, whatevs.

450
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,360
But does anybody audit Twin Galaxies?

451
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,160
You know, especially if there are things that are going to be in the Guinness Book of World

452
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,720
Records and what have you.

453
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,160
Does Guinness audit them?

454
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,440
Guinness would, because they have, like, you know, they're strict regulations for how they

455
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
do things.

456
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,880
I don't think they would just take Twin Galaxies' word for it.

457
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,000
I mean, they'd have someone standing there recording all the data that's necessary.

458
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,200
At least that's how they do everything else, and I would think that they would have the

459
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,840
same integrity, since, you know, their name, you know, has a lot of writing on it.

460
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
So...

461
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,480
And, you know, I understand, you know, I understand why people get all into it, because, like,

462
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,000
you know, I think one guy who was, like, a friend of Steve Levy or something said it

463
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,280
best in the movie.

464
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,240
This guy, my friend Steve, is the best in the world at something, in the entire world.

465
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,680
And true, it might be Donkey Kong, but he's the best in the world.

466
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,760
And you know, I can see why people get so passionate about that.

467
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,480
Did you see him play through the kill screen?

468
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Yeah.

469
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
That was pretty sweet.

470
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Yeah.

471
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,160
I was playing through the kill screen once, once, and I was little, so...

472
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:08,560
All right, anyhow, sorry, a total tangent that took up more time than the much-

473
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,680
It's a cool tangent.

474
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,960
It's gaming and not food.

475
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Much sadder story.

476
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,640
Speaking of food, though, I ate at Olive Garden today, home of the never-ending breadsticks.

477
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,600
I'm sorry I didn't invite you, Jamie, I just, it was a last-minute thing, but that's the

478
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,240
first time I've had it since the surgery and everything.

479
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,880
Sorry, bad tangent, especially following a story about such horrible layoffs as Sony,

480
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,040
but unfortunately we don't have a lot more to tell you there.

481
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,160
All right, let's talk about sales, and maybe this might help explain kind of the Sony layoffs

482
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
and so on.

483
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,600
Some of the November numbers from MPD are in, talking about the sales, and the Wii in

484
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,760
November sold 2.04 million units, probably no one's surprised.

485
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,000
The DS in second place, 1.57 million units.

486
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:04,760
Xbox 360, 836K, PSP, 421K, PS3, 378K, PlayStation 2 is finally in last place, 206K.

487
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,020
So this might finally be the PS2 kind of walking out the door here.

488
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,360
But it's kind of strange that the PS3, you know, is-

489
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:18,920
The PS2 is definitely on its way out, it's not, I'd say maybe by the end of next year,

490
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,920
because I mean, looking just at what the releases are, like for example, in February, there

491
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,200
are three games coming out for the PS2, and that is it.

492
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:38,880
In January, I think two or three also coming out, so it's getting a lot less prevalent,

493
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,920
but I think by the end of next year, you'll see most games have already moved on to the

494
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
new platforms.

495
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,920
And we see the PSP sold more than the PS3, which is, you know, well, it's a cheaper system.

496
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:57,200
And they were also just coming out with the new PS3, or PSP 3000s.

497
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,600
Float Walkin' Chat says people buy PSP still?

498
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,880
Yeah, because, you know, they are, you know, it isn't just a game system, but it's, you

499
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,120
know, the whole movies and internet and MP3s in your pocket, so it's-

500
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,760
But they are released.

501
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,400
Sadly enough, a lot of the publishers are just not making PSP games anymore.

502
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Yeah.

503
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,560
And a lot of games coming out is really sad, and it's not a good sign.

504
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,160
Why do you think everyone jumps ships suddenly?

505
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Just sales?

506
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Just sales numbers.

507
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,580
They put out a PSP version of their game, and either development takes too long, or,

508
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,800
you know, it just doesn't sell.

509
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,920
Like, I've noticed a lot with, you know, like Crash of the Titans, for example, came out

510
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,600
at the beginning of October on, you know, all the other systems, it came out a few weeks

511
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
later on the PSP.

512
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,040
You know, the PSP versions are getting delayed.

513
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
I don't know why.

514
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,960
I mean, I can't imagine it's that hard a program for it, but it's just, they don't sell very

515
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
well.

516
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Their versions aren't very good.

517
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,000
It's just, they all have the install base for it.

518
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,080
People are playing DSs more, which, you know, there's a lot of good PSP games, it's just,

519
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
I don't know.

520
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,200
It's gonna take some really good PSP games.

521
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,520
It does sound like, though, Sony has some plans of what they're gonna do to maybe drive

522
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,020
more PSP sales, and they're definitely not giving up on it, you know, with the whole

523
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,600
rumors with LittleBigPlanet and MotorStorm.

524
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,200
You know, we know Dissida's coming out next year, probably sometime.

525
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,880
So those are three big games right there.

526
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,680
You know, I wonder if the Final Fantasy VII remake that people always have big boners

527
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,200
talking about on the PlayStation 3, like, you know, big fan-gasm, you know, talking

528
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,640
about they want it to happen on PlayStation 3.

529
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,080
I wonder if they wouldn't do something like that for PSP.

530
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,600
I wouldn't think it'd be very good.

531
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,800
They could bring the Final Fantasy VII, maybe redo some of the graphics a little bit, but,

532
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,880
you know, like a high-quality remake like you saw the little teaser video for, I think

533
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,160
they'll have to be on the PS3.

534
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Eh, crazy thought.

535
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,520
Let me recap the ten games that sold the best November.

536
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,720
This gives you a really good idea of what's gonna wind up under trees at Christmas time,

537
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,280
and what I like about this list is it really is a mixture of big releases getting sold

538
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,900
on their day of release and things that are gonna be under the Christmas tree.

539
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:10,080
Number ten was Wii Music, on the Wii, which, you know, kind of contradicts that story we

540
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,300
had a couple weeks ago that wasn't selling very well, because it was the tenth best-selling

541
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,120
game in November.

542
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:20,440
Maybe didn't hit the millions and millions of expectations, but, I mean, the tenth best-selling

543
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,920
game out of everything that's out there, that's not that bad.

544
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
No?

545
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Right?

546
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,800
Well, then also I think last, the last report we saw for the NPD numbers, it was only out

547
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,000
for like a week, so that's not necessarily a bad thing.

548
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Ninth place, I'm sorry?

549
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,440
I was gonna say, it definitely isn't selling as well as some of the other Wii games, let

550
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
me put it that way, though.

551
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,020
Ninth, well, there's only five Wii games on this list, so it's the fifth best-selling

552
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,200
Wii games, and when we talk about what Wii games are selling, it's old shit, so, I don't

553
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,120
know, it's in, you know, I...

554
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,120
I can probably have explanations for most of these, so go ahead.

555
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,640
Number nine was Resistance 2 on the PlayStation 3, which, you know, is PS3's, one of their

556
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,360
big titles.

557
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,400
Number eight was Left 4 Dead on the Xbox 360.

558
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
I really need to pick that game up.

559
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,560
That game's been performing above expectations, right?

560
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
Yeah.

561
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
I'm doing very well.

562
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,840
Number seven was Guitar Hero World Tour on the Wii.

563
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,160
Number six was Call of Duty World of War on the PS3.

564
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,320
Number five was Mario Kart on the Wii.

565
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
You know why?

566
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,400
That game's still short-handed.

567
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,360
People are still trying to get it because they've either artificially made it short

568
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,000
for it, or whatever the case may be.

569
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,160
It's been hard to get in, let me put it that way.

570
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,400
Well, I was just also guessing that's a game that's gonna be under Christmas trees everywhere.

571
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Oh, yeah.

572
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
That's a game that sells.

573
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,720
I mean, even on DS, it's still very popular.

574
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,080
Number four, Wii Fit.

575
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,240
Also another thing that's very short and hard to find.

576
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,060
Number three, Wii Play with the remote.

577
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,040
People just sell that like a remote, and hey, you get a $10 game.

578
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,720
That's gotta be why this game is still chopping the charts.

579
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,080
That's exactly why it's doing it.

580
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
It's because you get a remote.

581
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,840
I mean, it's an easy sell.

582
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,080
It's like you either buy a $40 remote, or for an extra $10, you get a game that's just

583
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,320
like Wii Sports.

584
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,040
And I bet parents everywhere are looking at this going, oh, cool, and putting it for the

585
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
kids.

586
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,040
Exactly.

587
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
That's gotta be it.

588
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,000
Number two, Call of Duty World of War, the 360 version.

589
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,520
And then number one would be Gears of War 2 on the Xbox 360.

590
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,400
But I should point out, if you add up the two Call of Duty World of Wars across 360

591
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,680
and PS3, that would be number one, not Gears of War 2.

592
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,160
But Gears of War 2 being Xbox 360 exclusive only has the one system to consider.

593
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,680
So just interesting.

594
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
Interesting list.

595
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
There you go.

596
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,120
Your November NPD numbers.

597
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:41,280
Well, for people like me who have an iPhone, there is some fun out there, although I've

598
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,000
been hearing mixed reviews on it.

599
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,280
There is I Love Katamari, which is actually I Love Katamari on the iPhone.

600
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,360
It's $7.99, and you can either play it on the iPhone or the iPod Touch.

601
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,680
And it's 82 meg, has a story, time attack, eternal and exact size.

602
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,200
And it apparently suffers really bad from the iPhone's poor frame rate for games, but

603
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,160
I figured I might download it eventually.

604
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,680
The last game I actually paid for was Pole Position.

605
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,600
I was gonna check it out, but then I read the reviews, and they all were bitching about

606
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
the frame rate.

607
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
And I was like, okay, maybe this isn't so cool.

608
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,320
Yeah, but that's just iPhone games anyway.

609
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,920
You look at any review on an iPhone game, they're gonna talk about the frame rate unless

610
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,800
it's something, you know, dinky like Pac-Man.

611
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Or Labyrinth, which is what I play all the time.

612
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,160
It doesn't matter, though.

613
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,280
I don't think, that's like bitching about the frame rate on any system.

614
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,640
I can't say that that's a reason to even put out a game then, oh, I can't get the frame

615
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
rate up where I need to be.

616
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,560
Well, then you can't release the game.

617
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,140
You can't get it up.

618
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:53,640
You have to make some sort of, like, you know, omissions, you know, for, I don't know whether

619
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,480
it be, like, you just use, like, cel-shading, you know, with really flat textures, so that,

620
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,040
you know, the size of the textures isn't really big, and so it's able to render it faster,

621
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,000
or I don't know, you know, they're trying to push the iPhone as, like, this big gaming

622
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,760
platform, and yeah, unfortunately to me, that's almost like pushing the N-Gage as a big gaming

623
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
platform.

624
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,440
No, no, no, no, no, no.

625
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,800
First of all, games look a jillion times better on the iPhone than they did on the N-Gage,

626
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,000
and I had a great gaming taco, I understand this.

627
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,040
On top of that, there's so much more functionality with the iPhone that comparing it to that

628
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:41,640
waste of electronics that was the N-Gage is seriously, like, comparing, I would have to

629
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:48,040
say a Blackberry with one of those old car phones, you know, that you had to attach to

630
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,560
your cigarette lighter and was the size of your head.

631
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:57,040
Here's my thing, is they, well, they're trying to be like a gaming platform, I mean, that's

632
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,920
what they keep saying is, like, they're, you know, one of the best gaming platforms out

633
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,960
there, which, I don't know how they can claim that, but they are.

634
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,080
I think if, you know, it's funny, if Nintendo had almost, like, taken the same idea and

635
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:16,880
just done almost, like, what XNA is doing, and opened that up to people to release apps

636
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,200
for, like, the DS, can you imagine how much money they'd make?

637
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
It's just ridiculous.

638
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,440
But it's the same thing there, and I can't even really call them a gaming platform anyways,

639
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,280
because for me, a game console is something that you can actually buy games for, not necessarily

640
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,400
just digital downloads, and I know that's the future of stuff, but I'm just not seeing

641
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
it.

642
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,920
I just, I think it's more casual, I don't know, I don't think it's ever going to take

643
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,800
the place of a handheld game system.

644
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,560
I want to read this comment real quick from AlphaKananagram in chat.

645
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,800
I love Katamari, in its current build, is the worst eight bucks I've spent.

646
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
It's neat, but slow.

647
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,160
Oh, there you go, a listener review of the game.

648
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,240
All right, let's move on.

649
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,440
Okay, so some other cool stuff.

650
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,560
We talked about this a little bit, you know, Home has finally made its way out, or at least

651
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,000
the beta of it.

652
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:24,320
It is a 77 meg download, however, you do need to have, I believe, three gigs dedicated to

653
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
this.

654
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,200
Yeah, when you start it up, it says that you have to dedicate three gigs of your drive

655
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,280
to the game, and it says okay, and then you basically, it partitions off a part of the

656
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
drive for it.

657
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
I don't know what it's doing.

658
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
It reserves a part of the drive.

659
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,280
That's because you're downloading new areas as you go.

660
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,400
You can go in there and download new stuff.

661
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,360
I'm not sure what it's all used for.

662
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,520
I don't know if it's caching data or something.

663
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,560
I think it's storage of the actual areas and stuff like that, probably the video.

664
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,440
Areas aren't that big.

665
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,860
The funny thing is, when you start Home, okay, then you get your apartment, but then you

666
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,840
have to download the central area, which is like 70 megs, and you have to download the

667
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,960
theater if you want to go in the theater, which is 40 megs.

668
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,040
You have to download the bowling alley, which is another 40 megs.

669
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
I don't know why they just didn't do it all at once.

670
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,520
Yeah, that part did seem a little silly to me, but whatever.

671
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,120
You just do it, and it doesn't take that long on a high-speed connection, which you're using

672
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,760
to play these things anyway.

673
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,200
Maybe it was so that you don't download stuff you don't need, but I just figured the 3 gigs

674
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
was some type of cache information.

675
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,680
It's probably so that their servers don't crash from everybody downloading it all at

676
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,520
once, and that way, it saves them a little bit of time, and then that way, every time

677
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,240
it goes in there, it checks to see if there's any updates to it.

678
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,760
Kind of like, remember how AOL was, how you'd go to different pages and you'd download updates?

679
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,560
It's kind of like that.

680
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,120
So it is available right now.

681
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,440
You can check it out.

682
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,600
However, there are issues, and obviously, they've been having trouble with it staying

683
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,820
online, and they've had to actually shut down the PlayStation Network for about an hour

684
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,920
to fix stuff, and yeah.

685
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:04,360
So it's definitely acting like it was in beta, but it's available to check out, and it's

686
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,800
been a long time coming.

687
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,000
Weren't they having a lot of issues on launch day with the downloads?

688
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yeah.

689
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Like, I heard, yeah.

690
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
But I don't know.

691
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,080
I got in there very easily, but I didn't remember it was out until, like, late in the evening.

692
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,880
I think I'd been watching a movie, and then I was like, oh yeah, I want to download Home.

693
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,400
Yeah, I'm not going to try it for a while.

694
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,960
I just haven't gotten, I'm not really gung-ho to jump into it.

695
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,160
It just kind of, eh.

696
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:33,920
It was like the avatars for me, you know, just like on the new Xbox experience or whatever.

697
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,960
It was kind of neat, made my avatar.

698
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,040
That's it, you know, whatever.

699
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,040
Question from Chatroom.

700
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
Tigerclaw asks, interesting.

701
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,760
Does it let you walk around the world as it downloads in the backgrounds and stuff?

702
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,560
It's kind of annoying when you're walking in an environment that appears empty, and

703
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,480
then about a minute later, everything suddenly appears, and you appear to have run into a

704
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,480
wall.

705
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,080
No, it doesn't do that with the environments.

706
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,000
That's why you have to download everything before you go in.

707
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,680
So it doesn't actually download the environment as you go.

708
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,840
It will download as you go, like the movie that's playing in the movie theater, like

709
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,400
the Twilight trailer or whatever.

710
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,720
You have to wait for that to download before you're going to see it on the screen.

711
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,160
But what's kind of sad about that is that there's nothing to do in that theater otherwise.

712
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,440
I mean, people are there sitting in seats talking and saying all these things you really

713
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,760
don't even need to read anyway.

714
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,760
That's just lame.

715
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,320
But, I don't know, there's really not a lot of point to it.

716
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,960
Now remember when Home was going to let me show whatever movie I wanted to on my screen

717
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,960
in my home?

718
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
Like, remember that?

719
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Yeah.

720
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,960
We were supposed to have that?

721
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,960
Now that would have been cool.

722
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,280
Yeah, I think they got rid of that because of licensing.

723
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,040
I know, because you'd think people would put up porn and what have you.

724
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,240
No, I think they weren't even caring about porn, they were caring about people putting

725
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,240
up like, say, a fight.

726
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,440
Okay, so copyrighted porn.

727
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Yeah.

728
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,440
Okay.

729
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,240
But imagine if we could have had an OLR clubhouse, and we could have shot like some video just

730
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,640
for fun that could loop in the clubhouse or something that we could have had in there

731
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,360
just for fun and change it out once a week or something.

732
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:07,160
That would be great, and that's potential, but I just know that's not going to happen

733
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
for years.

734
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:17,400
Now is that something like, what is it, where you have to be, do you have to be like, logged

735
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,600
into that, your account or something like that for someone to be able to jump into your

736
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,600
clubhouse?

737
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,600
Or is it just-

738
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
It's not available yet.

739
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,600
Yeah.

740
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,760
And you're going to have to pay for them when they do come out.

741
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,960
I mean, if it's just a small fee, I don't mind paying it just to kind of screw around

742
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,760
with it, you know, because I think there's potential to, you know, kind of have the community

743
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,960
there and, you know, we're all about community here at OLR.

744
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:44,240
But I want to know a little more about what you can actually do with it, because it seems

745
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,560
like it's going to be a little limiting.

746
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,480
And I don't know if I would have to be on or not, but the PS3 is also one of those systems

747
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,600
you can kind of just leave on, and it doesn't make any noise or nothing.

748
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,520
If you could, like, hook up a PS3 in here, and then broadcast our show into that clubhouse

749
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
and have us on the TV.

750
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
That's what I was thinking!

751
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,200
Like, wouldn't that be an awesome potential?

752
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,200
That would be awesome.

753
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,440
Like, if we could actually, because if you can talk through your headset, then that thing

754
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,120
supports streaming audio, and I'm sure there would be a way that during the duration of

755
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,560
the show we could just shut everyone else up.

756
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,560
We shouldn't be giving away all our ideas, other podcasts are going to steal them.

757
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,560
Eh, whatever.

758
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,440
Wouldn't be the first time.

759
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,200
But, you know, that's kind of like the idea I would want to do.

760
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,640
So there's potential there, but I don't know.

761
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,400
Jason says, you can create a club at home and it will cost $5.

762
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,000
Can you actually do that now?

763
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,300
When I tried to look at it, you couldn't do it.

764
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,680
Did they actually open that up and I just couldn't figure it out?

765
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,780
Tigerclaw says, this is why Second Life does it better.

766
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,200
You can actually create a club, invite people to come over, and the club will actually play

767
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,240
music in the background by streaming a shotcast stream into it.

768
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,080
Maybe we should have put a thing in Second Life a long time ago, but it was kind of expensive,

769
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,080
wasn't it?

770
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,080
I don't remember.

771
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,080
It's Second Life, I don't want to touch that.

772
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,080
It's like, dirty.

773
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,440
Well, home's not much better then.

774
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,240
Well, it's not much better, but it's like the new gas station bathroom.

775
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,440
It's a brand new gas station!

776
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,440
The bathroom hasn't quite gotten all disease-ridden yet.

777
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,200
Alright, well, let's move on.

778
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,600
Let's talk about other PlayStation 3.

779
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:17,160
What could have been, and according to 1UP, apparently what happened, Final Fantasy Elite

780
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,160
11.

781
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,840
Kind of interesting that it came out on the Xbox 360, but it never really came out on

782
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,840
the PlayStation 3.

783
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,880
I mean, true, you could do the PS2 backwards compatibility, but even then, sometimes the

784
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,600
hard drive issues would kind of get in the way, I think, depending on what system you

785
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,600
owned, I think.

786
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,360
But then you could download a patch that would allow you to play it from the PS2 version

787
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,360
on the PS3.

788
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
Okay, that's cool.

789
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,560
But at some point, they were going to release, I guess, a nicer version, I guess you could

790
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,560
say, on the PlayStation 3.

791
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,440
Probably one with all the expansions included and what have you.

792
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,640
Well, apparently, it was supposed to happen, but apparently, the Sony representative that

793
00:49:53,640 --> 00:50:01,520
Square was working with, they were working with Hiromichi Tanaka, I guess, was just quit.

794
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,440
And they never really resumed talks, which is kind of strange.

795
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,920
Oh well, Final Fantasy 11 is still getting three new expansions next year, but not through

796
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,240
the traditional retail channels.

797
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,120
They will all be downloadable story expansions.

798
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:19,520
No new classes, none of that stuff, just story and quest expansions, which is interesting.

799
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,520
I assume zone expansions, too.

800
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,560
So yep, Final Fantasy 11 on the PS3, it was an idea, so if you wondered why it wasn't

801
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,000
there, somebody else must have been thinking of the same thing, but then they just gave

802
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
up.

803
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah, they didn't care, like some of us.

804
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I guess.

805
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,640
I'm kind of over Final Fantasy 11.

806
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,840
I know you're in Other Addiction now.

807
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,240
Yeah, I have WoW now, but I would like to revisit Final Fantasy 11 someday when it gets

808
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,200
redone and has a new, like Final Fantasy 11-2.

809
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,200
Why not?

810
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,200
They did 10-2.

811
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,200
Why can't they do 11-2?

812
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,560
Maybe because they have good taste sometimes.

813
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,960
Oh, shush.

814
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,520
Well, here's something that should excite a lot of people.

815
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,000
I know there's a lot of our listeners out there who are fans of Fallout 3.

816
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:10,580
Well, for the PC, Bethesda actually brought out a PC toolset for Fallout 3 so that you

817
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:16,680
can, I guess, create your own levels.

818
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,520
You can modify and edit buildings, landscapes, dialogue characters, basically you can just

819
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,800
change it all up into your own game, pretty much.

820
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,200
That's why Logie's not all over this.

821
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,500
It was called the Garden of Eden Creation Kit.

822
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,040
I don't really mod games anymore.

823
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,960
I wait for other people to mod them and then add to it.

824
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,520
You can download it off of the Fallout 3 website.

825
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,520
It's 8.47 megabytes.

826
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:51,280
I want someone to do the wondrous thing that someone has done with the Half-Life editor

827
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,480
and make me a Hypercube version of Fallout 3.

828
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,320
I would like to see one where the world ended because of something Jamie did.

829
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
Mega Maniac Mansion!

830
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,400
Seriously, you totally could.

831
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,880
That would be pretty awesome.

832
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,920
Well, actually, I was going to say, other than all the cool stuff for Half-Life, Grand

833
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,680
Theft Auto IV, they have some of the first mods out there for it.

834
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,800
Of course, the game actually doesn't allow you to run files that are modified, but someone's

835
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,560
found a way around it, like it was cake or something.

836
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:30,440
And they've made pistols that fire rockets, which are pretty funny, and then also pistols

837
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:37,680
and machine guns that have really hard kickbacks to them, so you fire it at a car or something

838
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,640
and it actually blows the car back and blows people away like they got hit with a jet or

839
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,640
something.

840
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,160
But it's pretty funny and cool handling mods and stuff like that.

841
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,080
You can set it up drifting and whatnot.

842
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:58,400
So it's crazy that this game's only been out for a week or so and they've already gotten

843
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,160
mods and a mod system in place.

844
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,280
So can't wait to actually try some of these.

845
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,540
Haven't gone around to actually modding it yet, but that's why I got it.

846
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,840
So fun times.

847
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,840
Alright.

848
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:22,160
Now, some other cool stuff available for Fallout 3, of course, is some brand new download content,

849
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,240
and that'll be coming soon.

850
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:30,520
What's kind of neat about the download content, though, is they're going to be raising the

851
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:36,440
level cap on it, and you'll actually be able to...

852
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,520
I don't know what level they're going to raise it to, but I know right now it's pretty limited.

853
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,160
I think it's like 30 or something, which is kind of cool.

854
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:51,840
And then, of course, the first screenshots have been released for the new download content

855
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,120
where you get the fight in Alaska, which is kind of cool looking.

856
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,120
Fight in Alaska?

857
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,080
Well, it's going to be like a simulation, I guess, for one of the...

858
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:06,200
I haven't played the game yet, but some of the backstory stuff for it, which is kind

859
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,360
of neat.

860
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,240
And that should be coming soon.

861
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,240
I think the level cap is actually going to be the third bit of updates that they're going

862
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:21,360
to have, but they're going to also add, I guess, some more stealth action focused missions.

863
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,320
They're also going to have a Chinese base to get the fight through, and some other exclusive

864
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,320
download content.

865
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:31,440
But, yeah, the first download content actually should be available soon.

866
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,120
Operation Anchorage is what it's called.

867
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,040
And it's four to five hours long.

868
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,440
It's going to be 800 Microsoft points.

869
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,400
All right, well, shifting gears here a little bit, talking about a different type of quest.

870
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,480
I promised there'd be a story on WoW tonight, and it's not really the type of story you

871
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,480
might be expecting.

872
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,320
It's actually something Game Politics ran, so you know it's going to involve controversy.

873
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
Something political.

874
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,160
It has to do with World of Warcraft.

875
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:00,480
And they are actually relaying news that another website, Boing Boing, reported on this week.

876
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,720
It has to do with Richard Bartell.

877
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,560
He is apparently the guy who invented mud games.

878
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:10,640
He kind of started the mud genre on the internet, which if you don't know what that is, God,

879
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,000
go read on Wikipedia or something.

880
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,080
Basically mud games kind of really led to things like World of Warcraft.

881
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,640
It was the first kind of online.

882
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,640
It was all text-based.

883
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,640
Like, imagine a text-based game like Zork, make a multiplayer.

884
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,200
Like a lot of hardcore Dungeons and Dragons people, this is what they would do in the

885
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,200
early days of the net.

886
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,880
I played lots of them.

887
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,880
Right.

888
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,880
But here's the thing.

889
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,280
Richard Bartell, he got his feathers ruffled.

890
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,280
He was playing WoW recently.

891
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,820
He was playing the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, and there's apparently a quest

892
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,820
in the game.

893
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,220
And I can tell you, this quest does exist.

894
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,560
There's a quest where you basically torture a prisoner to get information out of him to

895
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,840
move on.

896
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,960
And this is what Richard Bartell said about it.

897
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,840
Basically you have to take some type of cowpoke and zap a prisoner until he talks.

898
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,000
I'm not at all happy with this.

899
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,480
I was expecting for there to be some way to tell the guy who gave you the quest that no,

900
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,360
actually I don't want to torture a prisoner, but there didn't seem to be any way to do

901
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,360
that.

902
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,400
Worse, the quest is part of a chain you need to complete to gain access to the Nexus, which

903
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,080
is the first instance you encounter if you start at the west of the continent as I did.

904
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:07,560
So either you play along and zap the guy, or you don't get to go to the Nexus.

905
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,700
That's actually not true.

906
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,440
You can go to the Nexus at any time.

907
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,680
If you want the quest there, you do this quest line.

908
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,800
I did zap him pretty well in disbelief.

909
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,920
I thought that surely the quest giver would step in and stop at some point.

910
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,920
It didn't happen, though.

911
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,320
Unless there's some type of awful consequence further down the line, it would seem that

912
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,280
Blizzard's designers are okay with breaking the Geneva Convention.

913
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,480
It's a game!

914
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,520
I'm just kind of a little bit in disbelief, because it's like, well, A, he's completely

915
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,720
misstating the thing about you have to do this quest to enter the Nexus.

916
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,240
That's not true.

917
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,000
You can enter the Nexus whenever.

918
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,280
You know, you can get some in there.

919
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,200
You just don't get the quest line or what have you.

920
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:51,840
But there's like 50,000 quests now, and I'm obviously overstating that.

921
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,080
There's lots and lots of quests in Wrath of the Lich King.

922
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:59,480
Trust me, you can level your character to 80 and only play through four of the zones.

923
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,080
And there's like seven or eight zones, so you could skip this all together.

924
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,560
You could start on the east continent or whatever.

925
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:08,140
But anyway, okay, even if you couldn't skip this and it was a part of the game, I mean,

926
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:13,160
do you write angry letters every time you watch an episode of 24 and he tortures a prisoner?

927
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,960
Or every time you watch a movie?

928
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,200
Or every time somebody wrote a torture scene in a mud game somewhere on the internet, which

929
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
I'm sure exists somewhere?

930
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,140
I mean, hello?

931
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,640
What is it we always say here that you started here, Jay?

932
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,640
What is it?

933
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,640
Learn to be offended.

934
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,640
Yes.

935
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,640
Fucking people.

936
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,280
I mean, it's just a game.

937
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,480
And you know, if you want to, you just go to the quest and you click Abandoned Quest,

938
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,080
and there you don't have to do it.

939
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,200
How hard was that?

940
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:50,000
Anyway, the kind of ignorance stated here, even if this guy is a big deal for what he

941
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,760
did, it was kind of a silly thing to state here.

942
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:13,640
So you know, I'm just going to do the angsty F.U. as part of the show right now.

943
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,960
I don't care if this is political.

944
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,960
A big, flaming fuck you to George Bush.

945
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:29,400
For all of the series of legislation he's just passed during his last blessed day, the

946
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:36,040
end of his stupid reign in the White House, I mean, he's basically passed a bunch of executive

947
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:43,560
orders that are going to pretty much be creating some lasting damage, not just to our economy,

948
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:52,200
but to the several ecosystems by promoting waste dumping, by allowing mining very close

949
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:59,040
to national parks, in fact, I think one of them was near Yellowstone, if I'm correct.

950
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:07,460
Also for passing a law that pretty much lets any doctor not perform any kind of procedure

951
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:15,880
based on moral, personal ethics, not necessarily the overall ethics of the community that they

952
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,880
represent.

953
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,600
And it's really disgusting, a lot of it is, as far as I can tell, unconstitutional, and

954
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:29,200
I'm sure quite a bit of it can be overturned under congressional review, which is the one

955
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:35,960
good thing that Newt Gingrich ever did, apart from being hilarious on TV.

956
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:42,560
But it's very disgusting, I encourage everyone to study up on it, and definitely write your

957
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:48,400
congressman and let them know that, you know, you're disgusted too, I'm already preparing

958
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,400
several letters.

959
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,400
I mean, because, I'm sorry, our new president has enough shit to deal with right now without

960
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:03,840
having more shit thrown on top of it, so I have faith that he can clear through the muck,

961
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,880
but still, it's disgusting.

962
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,280
In fact, I'm so infuriated by it that it makes me feel sick to my stomach, so.

963
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,280
Alright.

964
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,280
Loki.

965
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:23,880
Um, I was gonna say F U 2, take 2 for putting out a crappy version, well, I should say a

966
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:29,960
buggy version of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, the fact that I've gotta still wait for

967
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:38,480
patches before they, you know, support something that most modern games support now is ridiculous,

968
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,760
and I don't know, I just hate having to wait before a game to work correctly, you know,

969
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,520
I, if I'm spending the money to, you know, buy the game, why does it have to be, you

970
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,480
know, weeks later that I get a game that actually works?

971
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,960
Is that it?

972
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,960
Alright.

973
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,640
Um, my F U of the Week goes to potstickers, because they're really addicting, like, I

974
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,920
had, um, I just can't stop eating potstickers, like, it's like, the food I've been craving,

975
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,120
like anytime I go out to a restaurant that might have them, I have to get potstickers

976
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,320
because they're so friggin addicting, and I never had this, like I feel like I'm pregnant

977
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:19,040
or something and craving things I don't usually crave before, and that food is potstickers.

978
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,560
I know, it's so random, but that's what it is.

979
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,560
So F U.

980
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,560
You're growing a gas baby.

981
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,560
Apparently.

982
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,640
So F U to potstickers for being so non-malicious.

983
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,760
There you have it.

984
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,640
And I've learned, you can get potstickers lots of different places, it's pretty surprising,

985
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,640
and I've probably sampled them everywhere.

986
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,360
Anyway, hey, let's move back into some gaming news, let's try to get this show actually

987
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,640
back on the track of gaming, with our next story.

988
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,640
We gotta.

989
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,640
Yeah, of course.

990
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,640
Okay.

991
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,200
Well, um, I'm sure we have a number of, uh, our listeners who are big Dragon Quest fans,

992
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,480
and the, uh, next installation, Dragon Quest X, is going to be on Wii.

993
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,920
Um, well, basically the next one is technically 9, isn't it?

994
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,200
But they've confirmed that X is going to be on Wii.

995
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,880
And that's pretty cool.

996
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:15,240
It's also going to be, as far as I'm aware, the first of the Dragon Quest games on the

997
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,600
Wii, so that's pretty cool.

998
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,200
And, um, the Japanese release date, by the way, for Dragon Quest IX is going to be March

999
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,320
28th.

1000
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,600
So it's going to be, uh, 5980 yen.

1001
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,200
Yay.

1002
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,640
Cool.

1003
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:39,360
Um, some other cool stuff that will be, uh, well, I don't know if we're getting this around

1004
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:47,000
here, but, um, Scrabble apparently has been released on the DS in, um, the UK.

1005
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,280
And, um, I think we actually had a story about something similar a while back, um, with the

1006
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:56,760
word spaz and how people kind of spazzed out about it.

1007
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:04,080
Um, well, now, apparently, a used copy of the game Scrabble, which apparently learns

1008
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:12,760
words based on, you know, stuff that you add in there, um, Scrabble, this, uh, kid actually

1009
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:19,960
was playing it, and apparently Scrabble beat him on a triple word score with the word fuckers.

1010
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:27,120
And, apparently, um, the mother of, you know, that's what I call my DS when it beats me

1011
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,120
at a game.

1012
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,120
Fucker!

1013
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:36,520
The mother, I guess, um, apparently, uh, Tanya, um, she had bought this game for her son Ethan,

1014
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,680
and it was a pre-owned copy, I guess, of Ubisoft Scrabble, which I didn't realize, I don't

1015
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:45,920
think they have it over here, I wish they did, because Scrabble's awesome, um, but what's

1016
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:52,440
funny, though, is it kept, um, you know, using different slang words, like, you know, tits

1017
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:59,440
to toke to fuckers, uh, and, I guess, gave Ethan poor self-esteem or something, I don't

1018
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,440
know.

1019
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:05,240
Here's what I want to know, was the mom watching him play the DS over his shoulder?

1020
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,240
I don't know.

1021
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,400
How else did she find out about it?

1022
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,880
Did he go crying to mommy, mommy, mommy, the game says fuck!

1023
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,340
Maybe he, maybe, you know, because, you know, Scrabble saw all the words on the board, maybe

1024
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:20,040
he saw the word fuckers on there, and she looked at it, and she's like, what the hell,

1025
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,280
wait, what the hell's tits on there?

1026
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,820
What the fuck is fuckers doing on there?

1027
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:31,120
So apparently, you know, this, you know, is coming from, I guess, um, you know, what she

1028
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:35,160
should have done is simply challenge the word, because I don't think you'd be able to find

1029
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,800
it in the official Scrabble dictionary.

1030
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:43,080
Well apparently, apparently, uh, this is coming from Tabloid Daily Mail, you know, they're

1031
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,760
hosts of a bunch of useless articles.

1032
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,760
So reliable?

1033
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,760
Yes.

1034
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:51,000
Um, Ubisoft is saying that she should have used the game's junior settings, because I

1035
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,800
guess fuckers isn't in the junior version of Scrabble, and Nintendo, of course, doesn't

1036
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,800
want anything to do.

1037
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:01,800
That's where it'll just use, you know, Lil' Fucker.

1038
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:10,720
I mean, really, this is news, really.

1039
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,720
It's just funny.

1040
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,720
She's really ugly, too.

1041
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,720
She looks like she got beat with the ugly stick a bunch of times.

1042
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:21,160
It's just J100Matt in chat says, uh, why do these fucking kids need to tell their parents

1043
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,720
that their games are cursing at them?

1044
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,720
I would laugh.

1045
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,720
I would think that's awesome.

1046
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,220
I would show it to my friends.

1047
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,860
That's what you're supposed to do.

1048
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:29,860
With naughty language.

1049
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,860
Look at my boy, dude!

1050
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:40,920
You know, instead of Lil' Ethan going, Mommy, Mommy, my game swore at me, I'm telling, you

1051
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,920
know.

1052
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,360
Lil' punk kid.

1053
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,280
I think there's actually a version of Scrabble.

1054
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:50,720
And you want to know, you know, she's totally grooming him to be a little wuss anyways,

1055
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,760
you know, him and his pink DS.

1056
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,720
Hey, wait a minute.

1057
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,600
You know, here, you know, there's some type of Scrabble.

1058
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,160
You know how like every board game has their own house rules?

1059
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:09,380
Like in Monopoly, you might have a house rule where all the tax money goes into a free parking

1060
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,960
jackpot for when you land on free parking, right?

1061
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,600
Well, I think there's some house rules for Scrabble where dirty words automatically are

1062
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,120
triple word score.

1063
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,520
So like it encourages people to use bad words.

1064
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,640
Yes, we do that all the time.

1065
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,640
Absolutely.

1066
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,580
We even played Ebonics Scrabble one time.

1067
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,280
That was God.

1068
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,720
Wow.

1069
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,200
Wow.

1070
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:37,080
If it sounded like a word, it was a word.

1071
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,080
I'd like to play that sometime.

1072
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,200
That would be fun.

1073
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:48,600
Anyhow, one game I was mad when they discontinued many years ago and made me yell, fuckers,

1074
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,760
was when they got rid of the great Gianna Sisters.

1075
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,680
1987 was the year that this game was originally released, and it was pretty awesome.

1076
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:01,200
It was on the Commodore 64, but the problem was it looked and felt just like Mario.

1077
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,760
Although if you actually played it, there was like a lot of differences.

1078
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,920
Like for instance, hello in the great Gianna Sisters, you actually fight a giant enemy

1079
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,240
crab at the end of like the second level.

1080
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,000
I know this predates even the PlayStation 3, but unfortunately, at least the very first

1081
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,200
level like seriously looked exactly like Mario World 1-1.

1082
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,000
So you know, the similarities were shown in this game ended up having to get pulled off

1083
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
the market.

1084
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,080
It was also not just big on the 64, I believe it was a big Amiga game for what I know, but

1085
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,680
the soundtrack was amazing.

1086
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:35,000
Well, anyhow, the game was, you know, taken off shelves and it kind of lived on throughout

1087
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,680
the homebrew community and people, you know, looking for abandonware on the internet and

1088
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,840
what have you.

1089
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:46,760
Apparently, one of the creators of the game, the programmer, Armin Gessert, he is now working

1090
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:52,440
on an official DS version with his new studio, Spellbound, and it's apparently going to be

1091
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,480
coming out in June.

1092
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:00,080
It's going to have over 80 levels and apparently the DS microphone is going to play into the

1093
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,320
game somehow and they'll actually use the touch screen and everything.

1094
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:07,720
Now one of the great things about the original game was the soundtrack and the new version,

1095
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:13,440
Chris Hilsbeck, is coming back to do remixed versions of the original soundtrack.

1096
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,000
So that's pretty awesome.

1097
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,240
And this is one of those games where, you know, if you've never played this game, maybe

1098
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,520
some week we'll highlight it as a classic game of the week down the road, but it's one

1099
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,700
of those games you definitely should check out.

1100
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:30,760
I'm sure there's clips on YouTube of the game and just, you know, you can see it's similarities

1101
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,760
to Mario Brothers.

1102
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:36,780
But it was kind of neat, it was a fun game, especially for that era, you know, it doesn't

1103
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:40,440
really hold up against today's games, which is why I'm interested to see kind of what

1104
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:45,640
they do to it on the DS version, how they're going to kind of make it unique.

1105
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,000
But based on the screenshots, it looks a lot different.

1106
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,680
It definitely doesn't look like Mario anymore, that's for sure.

1107
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,780
So we'll see.

1108
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:55,280
Let's move on.

1109
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:00,440
Well, moving forward, it looks like we've actually got some release dates.

1110
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,600
How does that sound?

1111
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,600
Release dates!

1112
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,280
Well, it is December, so what else can we expect?

1113
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,000
Let me go ahead and take a look.

1114
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
For the UK?

1115
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,240
Exactly, for the UK.

1116
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:20,760
Actually, it's Crash Commando and Sonic Unleashed.

1117
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,480
That's really it.

1118
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,480
I was going to be a little bit more excited, but I guess not.

1119
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,440
I can't say things are much better in the US, though.

1120
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:34,120
There are a few things coming out, so it's not that bad, but it's certainly not, you

1121
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,540
know, in November or anything like that.

1122
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:41,240
This week, though, some of the highlights, Rise of the Argonauts will be coming out on

1123
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:45,960
all systems, well, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1124
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:54,480
Also this week, we've got the release of some DS games, Kate West's The Vanishing Files.

1125
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:03,080
We've also got Mystery PI, Portrait of a Thief, and Dreamer Horse Training, because god damn

1126
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,120
it, there's not enough horse training games.

1127
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,080
And Puppy Training, which has a really cute cover, that's awesome.

1128
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:16,040
Slingo Quest, also coming out from DS, it's a mumbo jumbo casual game.

1129
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:22,520
And Neopets Puzzle Adventure, ripping off Puzzle Quest there.

1130
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:28,920
And let's see, lots of crappy DS games this week, man, I swear.

1131
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:35,120
Australia Zoo Quest, which is a puzzle game and for some reason has Cyberwin on the cover.

1132
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,200
Yeah, it's crikey indeed.

1133
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:43,800
Learn Math for grades 1 through 4, a math learning game.

1134
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:48,960
Driver's Ed Portable on DS, yes, you can learn how to drive.

1135
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:55,080
And other things other than DS games, there's a few Destiny or Wii games.

1136
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:59,040
Summer Sports 2, Island Sports Party, you know, they're a party game.

1137
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:04,640
And We're Jeong Party, it's a mah-jeong party game, interesting.

1138
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:15,280
And Rock Band 2 on the Wii, the game only version will be coming out on the 18th.

1139
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:24,800
And I just gotta mention this, on the 19th, Calvin Tucker's Redneck Jamboree on the Wii.

1140
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,800
That's it.

1141
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,880
Well, you know, if you want a busy week for game releases, you need to look at Japan,

1142
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,800
because there's tons of stuff coming out in Japan this week.

1143
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,720
Now granted, a lot of it is localized versions of stuff we've already had here in the US,

1144
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,440
but let me talk about what's coming out in Japan.

1145
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,320
Starting with 360, we have just that, a big release for Japan would be Fable 2, the localized

1146
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,560
version is coming out this week, December 18th.

1147
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,080
Lego Batman, Need for Speed Undercover, and Prince of Persia, also all being released

1148
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,480
on the 360 in Japan this week.

1149
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,840
Also a game local for Japan, Gundam Musou 2 comes out in Japan.

1150
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:03,480
And this game is a shooter that looks to be probably based on Gundam, yep, robots with

1151
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,480
guns.

1152
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,520
Stacey Warriors Gundam 2, there you go.

1153
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,040
That game is coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

1154
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,520
Moving on to the Playstation 3, many of those same titles, there's also Gundam Musou 2 comes

1155
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,040
out there as well.

1156
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:20,000
Lego Batman, Medal of Honor gets a price drop, as does the Godfather and Armored Core.

1157
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,840
That's what you've got to look forward to on the Playstation 3, although I do want to

1158
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,400
point out there's also a wireless keypad available now in Japan, if you want to check that out.

1159
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,600
Hey, on the Wii, they have a game called Let's Tap is coming out from Sega in Japan.

1160
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,120
Remember that's the one where it's the game that penguins can play.

1161
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,920
Oh, that's right, a game that even penguins can play.

1162
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,160
You set the Wiimote on the box and you tap the box.

1163
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,360
You don't actually use the controller at all.

1164
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,360
Oh, yes, yes, okay.

1165
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,280
Kind of looks interesting, there's all these little visualizers and things.

1166
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,280
I wonder if, they'll probably be, they're bringing that over here, right?

1167
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,320
Could be interesting.

1168
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:59,280
Bleach vs. Crusade also coming out on the Wii this week, because you know, you love

1169
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,280
Bleach.

1170
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,520
So there you go.

1171
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,680
Dance Dance Revolution Furu Furu Party comes out this week in Japan as well, and that would

1172
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,640
obviously be our version of Dancing Party.

1173
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,960
And Elibits gets a price reduction this week, hooray.

1174
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:20,360
Also going on the Playstation 2, a little game called Beatmania 2DX gets its 15th game

1175
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,520
in the series on Playstation 2 this week.

1176
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,460
DJ Troopers comes out on December 18th.

1177
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:29,640
Not the 15th game on the Playstation, however, because they didn't start with 1st.

1178
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,640
They started on 3rd style.

1179
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,680
But this would be the 12th game on the Playstation 2 in the 2DX series.

1180
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:39,360
In Japan only, that's not even counting the one we got in the US.

1181
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,160
Fate Unlimited Codes is also coming out on the Playstation 2 as well as another version

1182
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:51,960
of Gondamuso 2 for the Playstation 2, and Pachinko series volume 13, Neon Genesis Evangelion.

1183
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,960
Yet another one.

1184
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,960
Lord.

1185
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,800
Why can't they let that series die?

1186
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,360
They just can't.

1187
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,440
On the DS, lots and lots and lots of games getting released on the DS over there as well

1188
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,040
as some other, let me just kind of give you some of the names of things coming out.

1189
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,960
Tales of Hearts is one that's coming out, as well as Space Puzzle Bobble.

1190
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,320
Ragnarok Online DS comes out this week.

1191
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:17,160
Jamie Alistin, Ragnarok Online on the DS, finally, this week in Japan, there you have

1192
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,160
it.

1193
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,320
And Jamie, you might be interested in this one too.

1194
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:25,480
Princess Ballerina, Yumei Miru 4 Gen no Primadonna.

1195
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,920
Don't you like primadonnas?

1196
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,320
No, but I'm watching Bush get a shoe thrown at him and that's pretty fucking funny.

1197
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,320
Stop it.

1198
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,880
Lego Batman also comes out.

1199
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:42,160
Rensu Suikoden Tear Crease comes out, that would be the Suikoden's strategic title.

1200
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:47,600
So it's a busy week in DS World and as far as the PSP goes, all the other systems are

1201
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,440
getting love, why not the PSP?

1202
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:53,440
And yes, Final Fantasy Dissida finally makes its way out of the PSP this week, I'm sure

1203
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,760
you'll be hearing a lot about that.

1204
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:02,360
Also I do want to point this out, Crimson Room Rebirth also comes out and some movies

1205
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:09,720
for the localized for Japan, Biohazard Degeneration, what would that be?

1206
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,960
And then Star Wars The Clone Wars also comes out this week in Japan.

1207
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:18,440
Need for Speed Undercover, Samurai Showdown Anthology, Ultimate Board Game Collection,

1208
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:22,520
all on the PSP, very busy week in Japan for releases.

1209
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,320
So there you go.

1210
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:30,280
Let's move on with more news and then we're going to take a quick break here.

1211
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:38,600
While there is a little bit more, this actually has to do with some, excuse me, with something

1212
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,520
having to do with Rockstar.

1213
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,880
There's going to be, well actually I think it already happened, there was a social club

1214
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:51,500
event put out by Rockstar for Midnight Club Los Angeles and Grand Theft Auto IV that was

1215
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:55,600
going on Xbox Live and Playstation Network.

1216
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:05,280
They were supposed to have a little contest, as in a video editor contest for GTA IV PC

1217
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,680
and then for topping the Midnight Club Ocean to LA time trial.

1218
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,800
And there were supposed to be prizes available for both.

1219
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:23,520
It was though already going on and I do believe it was from five to nine UK time actually

1220
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,880
I think today, so already going.

1221
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,960
Good luck to whoever won.

1222
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:35,080
That's pretty cool.

1223
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:40,860
Some other fun stuff, Prototype.

1224
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:46,080
You may remember this game being kind of like an open world, crack down meets, you know,

1225
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,680
kind of mutants type of thing.

1226
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:55,960
What's interesting though is, earlier this week, a bunch of different blogs and stuff

1227
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,680
were reporting that Activision's Prototype website is actually broken and some of the

1228
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:07,480
assets from apparently CES were leaking out onto the web.

1229
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:12,720
And there was all sorts of different gameplay videos and stuff like that, you know, that

1230
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:17,440
was supposed to be stuff that they were showing off at CES and then, you know, a few, I guess

1231
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:26,640
a day later or so, the hole was covered back up and the countdown back to CES was put back

1232
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,880
on the website.

1233
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:35,360
Well, the funny thing is about all that, that's what they want you to think, you see.

1234
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:40,760
The whole leak was a hoax, actually.

1235
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,760
Perpetrated...

1236
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,120
Do people know that?

1237
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,120
No.

1238
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,120
Perpetrated by...

1239
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,800
So wait, you're saying the game blogs all got punk this week?

1240
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,480
Yes, they all got punk this week.

1241
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,480
Perpetrated by their marketing team.

1242
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,480
And how do you know this?

1243
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,480
You're making this up.

1244
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,480
You make this shit up.

1245
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,400
No, I don't make this shit up.

1246
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:03,300
I know this because they sent out an email boasting about it.

1247
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,840
So it's all a ruse...

1248
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,840
To who?

1249
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:07,840
To you?

1250
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,600
Why would Activision send you an email boasting about it?

1251
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:16,760
They send it to all of their retail partners to let their customers know because they're

1252
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:22,920
trying to drive up buzz for prototyping because everybody loves leaked assets and so they're

1253
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,220
going to start talking about it.

1254
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:29,100
If it was just a release of assets, it might not have been getting as much attention.

1255
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:33,060
But since it was something forbidden, people are interested in it.

1256
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,060
And it worked.

1257
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:40,440
It got them all to cover this leak and got all the information out there and the videos

1258
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:45,720
were ranked pretty high in game trailers and that's all good buzz for them.

1259
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,520
People want to see things they're not supposed to be seeing.

1260
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,520
Exactly.

1261
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,520
But it was a hoax the whole time.

1262
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,960
The whole time it was a hoax.

1263
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:59,280
They made it look like it was an FTP directory and everything and they got you all.

1264
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,140
And people don't know this yet.

1265
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,800
You're the one telling them.

1266
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:03,800
People don't know it.

1267
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,180
It doesn't really matter because the game looks awesome.

1268
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:12,640
The whole thing is they're tricking the people that they normally work with in the media

1269
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,400
to cover their game.

1270
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,840
Surely these people are going to find out eventually if they haven't already.

1271
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,840
Do you think there's going to be retaliation?

1272
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,840
No.

1273
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,480
I think this stuff happens all the time to be honest.

1274
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,480
Okay.

1275
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,480
Here's another thing though.

1276
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,600
Could they be saying now that, oh yeah, we meant for that to happen when maybe they didn't?

1277
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,600
No.

1278
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,600
It was in great detail.

1279
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:40,240
In fact, you know who tipped them off that the site had been broken?

1280
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,080
The people that orchestrated the whole thing.

1281
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:45,960
They're the ones that tipped off the media.

1282
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,280
Interesting.

1283
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:56,720
But just goes to show you, sometimes you may see these leaks via, I don't know, survey

1284
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:02,960
sites and stuff like that, and you may think, hey, why aren't these publishers doing anything

1285
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,320
to stop these leaks?

1286
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:11,580
Sometimes they're intentional, and sometimes that's how they drive buzz for stuff.

1287
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:16,760
Just a little bit of insight in the back workings of the game publishing world.

1288
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:20,540
I'm kind of not surprised by what you're telling me, but there is that very skeptical part

1289
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:24,940
of me that's like, oh well sure, they didn't know about it when it happened, but now it's

1290
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:25,940
...

1291
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:27,720
It was in great detail.

1292
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:33,880
I wish I had forwarded the email to myself so I could read it.

1293
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,380
It's funny.

1294
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,120
It's not that important.

1295
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:42,320
It's just funny.

1296
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,040
But the game itself looks pretty cool, I guess.

1297
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,280
Yeah, the game looks awesome.

1298
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,800
It's going to be a really fun game.

1299
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,000
It's definitely going to be something I pick up because it's like crack down.

1300
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,480
Come on.

1301
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,000
I'm feeling something I'll be playing.

1302
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
All right.

1303
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,920
Well, moving on, before we take a break here on the show, that was a pretty big bombshell.

1304
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,720
We should probably have said that earlier in the show.

1305
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,720
Yeah, whatever.

1306
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:05,720
It's not that big of a deal.

1307
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:10,240
A little reward to those who actually pay attention to the whole thing, I guess.

1308
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:15,240
Also a reward for being persistent and working at things.

1309
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,400
Not really gaming news, but kind of a gaming funny, I guess you could say.

1310
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,840
At Missouri State, there was a guy who used his wireless controller to find his stolen

1311
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,840
360.

1312
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,840
Here's the weird thing.

1313
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,040
His Xbox 360 got stolen.

1314
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,520
He lived in a college dorm.

1315
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,960
He noticed that he could still power on his controller because they didn't take the controllers

1316
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,960
because they were wireless.

1317
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,480
He could still power on his controller, and the controller was connecting to the 360.

1318
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,320
So knowing that, he realized it's in the next room.

1319
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,140
No, well, not necessarily, but he knew it was 30 feet away.

1320
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:49,440
So through the process of elimination, what he did, he actually went to the fourth, fifth,

1321
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,960
and sixth floors and found that the controller still worked on the fourth floor, fifth floor,

1322
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:56,380
and sixth floor, but it would not work on the third or seventh floor.

1323
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:58,680
So process of elimination, where was the Xbox?

1324
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,480
On the fifth floor, in the middle one, right?

1325
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,960
So then he went to the fifth floor.

1326
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,920
If you get too far from the Xbox, the thing will start blinking.

1327
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,480
So using the process of elimination, he found out where the center was.

1328
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,480
In hot and cold?

1329
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,480
Basically, yeah.

1330
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,740
hot and cold with his controller and it told him exactly where the stolen Xbox

1331
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:20,940
was and they actually got the RA, the resident assistant, to go into the room

1332
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:25,680
and where the stolen Xbox supposedly was they found the Xbox and apparently what's

1333
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:31,840
really funny about it is that the thief wasn't around when they got it so

1334
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:39,560
they know who lives there yeah interesting interesting people actually

1335
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,360
do have a brain in college people are retarded the old some people are brain

1336
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,480
in college some people who stole it obviously doesn't have a brain they'll

1337
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:52,560
be going home seriously I don't know I'd be pressing charges but that would be me

1338
01:22:52,560 --> 01:23:01,080
because you know I totally don't care so kinda um that's a stupid award in a way

1339
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:05,200
I probably stole it well but the thing is I I more give props to the guy who

1340
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,400
used the investigative skills to figure it out you know what I mean that's like

1341
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:13,640
the guy who stole it is I versus spy yes I guess you'd say it's kind of both at

1342
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:17,960
once a good job is it it's kind of like you're that what it would it go good job

1343
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,480
gumshoe remember Carmen San Diego yeah so he's the gumshoe of the week award

1344
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:25,560
did I almost actually bought that game on PC what we're in the world's Carmen

1345
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:29,440
San Diego yeah it was awesome I found it thrift store is that one of those games

1346
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,360
you can do a game tap I'm pretty sure it is I don't have game to build school

1347
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:41,560
once I have ZSNES and magic engine and actually have the systems to look we're

1348
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:45,640
gonna get into the classic game of the week is a part of the show we like to do

1349
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:49,760
here every week where dark soccer will take a game from years past and

1350
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:55,320
highlighted here on the show because you should respect your elders in games and

1351
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:04,520
you're just so excited you just throw in your microphone oh yes the classic

1352
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:09,320
video game of the week of the classic game of the week is willow for the

1353
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,960
Nintendo Entertainment System you know what's hilarious I was just thinking

1354
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,920
about this game today I shit you not and I was actually thinking like this game

1355
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,040
needs to be highlighted as a classic game of the week and I swear to God

1356
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:23,520
before I read that you were picking up for tonight amazing

1357
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,200
well you have to skip about a minute 25 minute music because it has the music I

1358
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:33,320
like which is the actual kicking-ass outside the village music

1359
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:48,360
it's like some of the best video game music ever you know what other game is

1360
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:54,280
awesome that's also based off a movie Adams family that's just quest was shit

1361
01:24:54,280 --> 01:25:02,520
it's pretty cool so well I own back to willow the game came out in 1989 it

1362
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:08,400
actually came out for the Famicom first in 1988 sorry it actually came out 1989

1363
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,840
on both systems but the movie came out in 88 so basically you play as willow

1364
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:22,840
and you go by yourself and it's kind of Zelda ish but not really it's more like

1365
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:28,600
um kind of playing like Secret of Mana did actually but being a Nintendo an NES

1366
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:33,480
game but it was put out by Capcom this is one of the cool things that Capcom

1367
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:39,160
has given us why don't we have willow in a Capcom game huh there are also other

1368
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:43,960
I'm thinking licensing for the movie I'm joking right there are also other games

1369
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:50,400
there was a computer game that came out on amiga Atari st and a DOS game that

1370
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:57,160
came out by a midnight entertainment group but it wasn't the same game it was

1371
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,600
a different one so anyone who's thinking they've got it you're wrong I was gonna

1372
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,120
say I'm surprised I'd never played that that's cool though there's also an

1373
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:10,680
arcade version but it was action adventure and again is not like this one

1374
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:16,480
this one is a is a action RPG is pretty cool little game and you could get you

1375
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:20,740
know basically your items and weapons and meet people from the game and go talk

1376
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:25,840
to stuff as RPG but it was willow and it was pretty cool plus you know it had

1377
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:34,880
acorns that turn people into stone I love this game

1378
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,440
all right there it is your classic game of the week willow on the Nintendo

1379
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:42,480
Entertainment System and there's a complete walkthrough there on YouTube

1380
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,440
that we were kind of playing the music from there you can just watch somebody

1381
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,200
blast through the game they use cheat codes to do it but you still get a

1382
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,520
pretty good feel for what the game looks like there so I love that game I played

1383
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,680
the crap I did too that was one of those games I rented and that we held on to it

1384
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,960
for like so long because I didn't want to take it back

1385
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:02,560
you ended up having to pay for it yeah well not not you know just a pretty you

1386
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:08,120
know like probably like $12 which is the time was a lot for a rental so there you

1387
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:11,240
go but willow was awesome all right we're gonna take a break here on orange

1399
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,720
Spike TV Awards through the matches of the internet right just last even though

1400
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:04,200
we don't really give a crap about the VGA's well do we find that do we ever

1401
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,960
find out if people actually vote on this or if it's just you know experts it may

1402
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,840
be experts but game of the year went to Grand Theft Auto 4 which yeah I mean

1403
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,440
there's so many games that come out hard to like rate one I play Grand Theft Auto

1404
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:23,160
4 a lot so yeah sure it's I guess my game of the year but um you know the

1405
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:26,960
best part about that is I guess we'll see a version of Grand Theft Auto 4

1406
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,000
come out you know because they always do the game of the year editions so

1407
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,560
there'll be one with the lost in the dam download content probably for the 360

1408
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:40,680
sometime maybe in the fall I don't know spring summer but you know they always

1409
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,120
did the game of the year edition the chat says it's experts that vote on it

1410
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:49,160
not the experts yet people that work for blogs and stuff actually I think there

1411
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:52,280
were people like I know there's someone from joystick that was on the voting

1412
01:28:52,280 --> 01:29:01,400
community and stuff like that so experts yeah ok sorry let's get into some real

1413
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:06,400
news now lucky alright well apparently a woman from Colorado think she has an

1414
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:13,600
expert opinion of Nintendo's neglect to provide adequate supports for

1415
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:22,000
we remotes yes there is another class-action lawsuit frivolous for well

1416
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:30,280
she doesn't think so for Nintendo's lack of adequate straps for their we remotes

1417
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:37,240
she claims that even though the new straps are thicker and they are the

1418
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:41,600
third purse our third version with a new plastic strap they still fail to secure

1419
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:49,080
the we remote to the user during strenuous use furthermore the suit

1420
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:54,140
alleges that Nintendo has failed to report a single remote strap issue to

1421
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:58,460
the Consumer Product Safety Commission in their monthly reports despite

1422
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:04,440
Nintendo support documents prove the existence of said issues you know what

1423
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,760
lady then you don't get to play the Wii you have your right taken away if you

1424
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,360
can't control you know a simple little thing in your head you don't get to play

1425
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:18,080
it I'm sorry but yeah I do agree with our sacred is extremely frivolous I mean

1426
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:23,640
for one the straps are basically there so that you don't drop the remote on the

1427
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:29,080
ground furthermore then they went to you reinforce them because idiots don't

1428
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:33,460
realize that they are just meant to prevent you from dropping them on the

1429
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:37,760
ground and so they even reinforce them enough to where you know if you let go

1430
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:43,580
accidentally it probably won't break but it's no guarantee I mean it's just do

1431
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:48,160
they need to put a sticker on the remote that says please touch me gently they

1432
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:53,800
have a warning in front of me with every single game ok they have a warning that

1433
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:58,760
says do not let go of the remote make sure the rip the wrist strap is secure

1434
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:04,760
they even have a stupid condoms on there you make sure that you know people if

1435
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:08,640
they do throw me it's gonna you know it's a rubbery support how much more do

1436
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:14,880
you want them to reinforce these things so that it is still good throw it you

1437
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,880
know I mean seriously and you know that's simply just a case of consumer

1438
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:26,400
stupidity someone needs to just duct tape her into someone seller will a

1439
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:30,680
judge throw this out yes or no judge order to be locked up in a cellar by

1440
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:37,240
duct tape duct tape is great for everything you know duct tape will

1441
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:41,040
silence the stupid masses alright you know what else is great is Circuit City

1442
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,040
you know I'm not talking about the actual store for the prices but the fact

1443
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:48,040
that they spoil things which is pretty awesome on the Circuit City apparently

1444
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:51,800
has a spilled some beans about some upcoming releases including Fire Emblem

1445
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:56,240
Shadow Dragon it's coming out in North America on February 23rd this is if I

1446
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:59,720
guess the Circuit City computer system is to believe I'm not sure exactly where

1447
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:05,400
this is coming from their website or something but yeah pretty cool huh yeah

1448
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:11,000
it's pretty cool also should point this out even bigger for UDS people Pokemon

1449
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:17,240
Platinum you still in the collective all Pokemon Platinum March 22nd and Circuit

1450
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:22,440
City had it listed but then they pulled it if that doesn't confirm it I don't

1451
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:29,520
know what does shadow or Fire Emblem that date is close if not accurate

1452
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:35,120
interesting but not that you know anything I know anything that you would

1453
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:39,840
ever repeated on the show now there have been a few things that move though so

1454
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:46,120
like some of those play for Wii games and stuff coming out later but I have a

1455
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:50,560
feeling though the reason why a lot of these have been pushed and stuff is

1456
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,240
they're gonna make a big announcement maybe at CES or something that you're

1457
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:57,920
gonna announce some more games and stuff maybe a little bit on the we see us is

1458
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,800
not a gaming show I don't know why people think these huge announcements

1459
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,960
are gonna come out at CES well they're gonna announce them at some point I mean

1460
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,800
it's only a few months off so I would think CES being the next show this

1461
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:12,520
sort of can do their own thing they can say we got Reggie coming to a party me

1462
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:16,160
and moto in the house and the press will show up but here's the thing though Rob

1463
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:22,480
is I think that they would do something at CES because the DSI then you know the

1464
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:29,120
DSI coming out next year at some point I mean that's a technology thing and fair

1465
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:35,320
enough because they may all into that I don't know that's just a guess all right

1466
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:39,200
I suppose that's an educated guess I would say it's like a seventh grade

1467
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:43,160
level educated guess no I'm kidding but all right we'll see what happens you

1468
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,640
might be right I've always kind of wanted to go to consumer electronic show

1469
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:50,680
just for the laughs and giggles but I won't be able to go this year that's for

1470
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,640
sure I do know that there are going to be gaming people there I mean there's

1471
01:33:53,640 --> 01:34:00,400
like I got a you know obviously I'm not going to see yes but I got an invite you

1472
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,880
know for anybody that you know game retailers are our customers or whatever

1473
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,800
if they were going to see yes that they can go sit through a Microsoft

1474
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,040
presentation they're gonna show them the upcoming stuff that they've got coming

1475
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:17,720
out for next year like you know probably just halo wars at that point but you

1476
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:24,400
know stuff like that so there will be some presence it's getting bigger yes

1477
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,800
well it's not that far off so we will see soon if they're gonna announce these

1478
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:34,120
officially or not yeah let's move on well something that is actually an

1479
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:39,360
official is that there's going to be former members of Team Ninja and those

1480
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:44,040
who worked on brawl doing a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighter I'm going

1481
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:52,400
to be on the Wii and it's supposed to be a 2.5 D fighter and it's supposed to be

1482
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:58,880
out late 2009 and it's a to quote it's supposed to feature online play to

1483
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:05,360
outperform brawl so I'm hoping that they can pull it off I mean that would be

1484
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:13,160
really cool I actually did like the old to the TMNT tournament fighters that was

1485
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:17,480
kind of a fun game so hopefully this will have actually I hope it has some of

1486
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:25,360
the the characters from that series I think would be fun definitely I mean the

1487
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:29,120
fact that they're saying that they're going to try to outdo Smash Brothers is

1488
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:34,440
kind of a pretty big boasting argument there but I don't know we'll see that's

1489
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:40,960
really high bar I guess to me something else is going to say is coming from

1490
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:45,400
check is too good Leo Shannon chat says Team Ninja equals April with breast

1491
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,200
physics there you go very nice

1492
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:58,320
let's see Halo Wars has been announced to be coming out now on March 3rd and

1493
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:02,760
kind of interesting there's a lot of stuff coming out right there in March

1494
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:08,280
especially since I think a week before that you have killed zone 2 on the ps3

1495
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:17,240
now of course Halo Wars is the RTS kind of prequel to the whole Halo series and

1496
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:23,200
they've got lots of interesting stuff in there including I think you will play

1497
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:28,840
as the flood the Covenant and also course you know the Spartans and stuff

1498
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:34,360
like that so that's pretty cool and I guess the game will be also coming out

1499
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:43,500
on February 26 in Japan so that's actually one that Japan's getting it a

1500
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:51,220
few days before us kind of interesting and apparently coming out in Africa

1501
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:59,720
Europe in the Middle East the day after so almost a worldwide release there be

1502
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,680
interesting to see how that is cuz I know it's probably not gonna do as well

1503
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:07,440
like a normal Halo game cuz it's a me I'm not a first-person shooter but it

1504
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:11,320
has a low name on it it does have a new name on it and there are a lot RTS fans

1505
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:17,920
out there so you know they're hoping to kind of be like a Starcraft but it's

1506
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,960
tough well here's something I'm hoping for and you know take this all the grain

1507
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:27,680
of salt because these are news items quote-unquote news coming from the

1508
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:30,000
latest issue of electronic gaming monthly which I don't know if you heard

1509
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
but they might not be around much more which kind of sad when you consider that

1510
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,440
magazine's been around a long long time but magazine take this all the grain of

1511
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,360
salt apparently I think it's probably all coming from quarter man or what have

1512
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:46,560
you yeah here's the thing apparently a sequel to rez is coming out from Tetsuya

1513
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,920
Mizuguchi now here's the thing it's not a real sequel to rez because apparently

1514
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:57,480
Sega owns the IP but he's gonna be making a you know rez-like game now

1515
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,840
they're quick to point out that it could be related to this QJ game that's

1516
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:03,680
supposed to come out for the Wii but it could be two different things going on

1517
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,040
altogether which in my mind it probably is because I think QJ was previously

1518
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:10,120
said it was gonna be a puzzler rez is definitely not a puzzler rez is an

1519
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:15,120
awesome fucking rail shooter game so but it's nice to know especially because of

1520
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:18,880
that I guess it did pretty well on Xbox Live it's nice to hear there's interest

1521
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,960
there again I just hope whatever this is doesn't come out on Wii that it is

1522
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,800
another HD game that makes sense

1523
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:31,960
yeah also kind of some other things going on apparently whatever mystery

1524
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:36,600
project LMNO that was going on at EA apparently that is now on ice right now

1525
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,360
I should say like gone forever but just on hold because of all the layoffs that

1526
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:43,440
were going on is the other Spielberg game yeah yes yes there was he worked on

1527
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,960
boom blocks so this is the other one he was doing apparently it is now on hold

1528
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:52,880
and maybe it could that be related to the questionable sales of boom blocks a

1529
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:57,720
new rifts game in 2010 as well in Gears of War 3 also in 2010 which really isn't

1530
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,520
a big surprise at all

1531
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,480
there's gonna be another Gears of War game they'll probably be Gears of War 4 at some

1532
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:07,040
point too just like they'll be a Halo 4 someday well I mean heck what do you

1533
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:10,760
call this halo 3 dark or no that has a new name now that the other random

1534
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:17,680
numbers and letters whatever that is just halo 4 right there you have it some

1535
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:23,880
rumors out of electronic gaming monthly take with grain of salt we have a little

1536
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:32,440
bit more rumor more like a hint is that there could quite possibly be halo 2

1537
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:42,440
halo 2 available as a full digital download so that's pretty interesting is

1538
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:51,920
basically when asked if if there would be the the quote is I can't say anything

1539
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:57,280
else on it I would be killed to death so I think it's pretty interesting

1540
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:04,280
yeah it's interesting because that would be the first like at least on the place

1541
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:08,600
on the Xbox 360 sorry the ps3 already did this with them the burnout game but

1542
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:15,200
on the 360 where you would have like a full you know $50 game $60 game which

1543
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:18,340
maybe would come down in price by the time they digitally distribute but you

1544
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:22,400
know a full price game for download you're starting to see this slowly

1545
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:26,760
happen with other games to like a wrath of the Lich King is available now as a

1546
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,940
digital download burnout obviously you start to see this more and more and you

1547
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:36,440
know game spot swears they're not worried I'm sorry game stop where's

1548
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:40,160
they're not worried now I wouldn't be there because it's the same with movies

1549
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:44,760
I mean movies there's more of that now we can actually purchase stuff and rent

1550
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:51,840
stuff online digital download but it's definitely not taken away too much from

1551
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:58,240
you know buying you know games I mean look at if anything you look at the

1552
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,200
special editions and special edition sales I mean people love their special

1553
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,320
editions and they keep getting more creative and putting more crap in there

1554
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:09,360
well in the case of fable 2 maybe not so much should be start taking stuff out

1555
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:13,280
but for everything else though I mean they're still getting people to buy

1556
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:18,200
these special editions for you know a lot of money I mean look at the

1557
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:22,600
legendary edition stuff of halo 3 and stuff which by the way I saw it fries

1558
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:26,520
this weekend for 59 I know you have a lot of those and yeah they weren't

1559
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:37,800
selling as hot as people thought yeah but yeah I mean it's definitely gonna

1560
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,880
head that way at some point where they'll allow you to download stuff but

1561
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:46,800
I think also people have to keep in mind is it really worth it downloading a game

1562
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:51,560
like that especially with like a 360 you know where your system might conk out on

1563
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,800
you then you gotta get a new one then you have to find some way to be able to

1564
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,960
you know how to tie to your new system and also when you're done with it you

1565
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:05,400
can't sell it off used which is another thing but you know that for some people

1566
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:09,960
that might not be a big deal and you only have so much room I mean what your

1567
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:13,760
hard drive fills up it fills up exactly that's kind of a bummer I mean sure they

1568
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,080
can release a new hard drive but those hard drives ain't cheap I paid a hundred fifty bucks for my 120 gigabyte hard drive

1569
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,840
yeah sadly enough those hard drives the actual parts don't cost that much and

1570
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:26,600
that's the bad thing about it is I mean they're just laptop hard drives through

1571
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:30,440
like a special connector it's just yeah don't remind me because I'm gonna get

1572
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:38,400
more mad you keep talking Loki but hey hey but you remember though that is one

1573
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:41,920
that is one plus though about the ps3 those they do let you upgrade your hard

1574
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,240
drive and you don't have to buy a special hard drive from them it's just any hard

1575
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:50,040
drive will do which I think is the way that Microsoft should have gone with

1576
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:56,520
their hard drives if you ask me but what do I know? One thing I will say this you know

1577
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:59,600
despite the hard time I gave the PlayStation 3 you know for many many

1578
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,960
years on this program I will say this I will admit this playing Prince of Persia

1579
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:07,680
this week it's been nice and quiet while I've been playing the game I'll give it that

1580
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:13,520
yeah so other things coming Fable II's way of course a brand new expansion

1581
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:18,800
Not Whole Island is going to be available to download on December 22nd it

1582
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:23,680
will run you 800 Microsoft points or that's ten dollars in real money and

1583
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:28,560
some interesting things along with that of course it's going to add some new

1584
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:36,120
costumes a bunch of new missions and some other fun stuff including some more

1585
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:41,600

1586

items in the box of secret shop or see another hero doing so the meteorologist

of Not Whole Island or help another hero doing so so interesting I may pick this

1592
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:19,600
up I'm not sure yet because I haven't really gotten to Fable II that much

1593
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:24,720
still want to go back to Lost Odyssey I haven't finished that your wife sure did

1594
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:28,280
get to Fable II though yeah she burned through the whole game really quick by

1595
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:30,720
the way your wife is pissed apparently she brought the wheat of the studio

1596
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:34,000
tonight yes I brought the wheat of the studio and she's been playing Animal

1597
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,120
Crossing quite a bit she got mad at me because I played it for four hours

1598
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:40,760
yesterday she's not gonna be able to pay off her debt to Tom Nook well she doesn't

1599
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:44,200
care about that she we're time traveling right now so we're in we're actually

1600
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:50,300
playing in July because we got bored with winter so yeah so now we're

1601
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:57,600
collecting bugs but yeah she's very mad she fact said I have to be home by 10 so

1602
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:02,320
that she can play Animal Crossing did we do we tell everybody not make it Loki

1603
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:06,320
might not be able to do the review yeah we're doing that preview tonight of

1604
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:10,560
maybe we might not make it no it doesn't matter yeah I'll be there by 10 or

1605
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:16,680
whatever yeah Tatsunoko vs. Capcom oh yeah very cool might be a short one

1606
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:20,760
tonight yes see um in fact you probably should get all that shit hooked since we

1607
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,080
don't have the adjusted TV cam tonight you might want to get all that hooked up

1608
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:26,240
before we I will wait one minute we go off air we can just go into that and be

1609
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:31,360
done hey left 4 dead is another one of those games I really need to check out

1610
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,760
at some point because I usually don't like to like first-person shooters that

1611
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,640
much but it's valve and it's zombies it might be pretty cool and I've heard

1612
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:39,640
nothing but really good things about this game except for the fact that

1613
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:42,800
people have been cheating on the game but guess what valve did this week they

1614
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:47,040
put the hammer down on that they fixed some exploits on the Xbox 360 version

1615
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,480
but here's the interesting thing about it apparently there were some cheats

1616
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:55,000
around where players were spawning all sorts of items enemies I guess some some

1617
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,720
type of exploit in the game valve was able to patch that server side so that

1618
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,840
way they didn't even have to push out a patch and wait for that to be approved

1619
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:04,600
from Microsoft so they fixed it on their end they put out a statement it is done

1620
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:09,480
but what you can still do it on your local games right you still do the thing

1621
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:13,400
because it only fixes this when you're playing the live games online basically

1622
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:17,840
what they did is they use that there's a mod tool that you can you have a device

1623
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,440
to basically rip files off your hard drive which they actually do sell them

1624
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:25,560
they're like 50 bucks think about picking one up because I need to buy

1625
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:31,920
useless crap you can mod a file on there and it will allow you to do different

1626
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:36,840
cheats in the game which might be fun because I like the cheating games and so

1627
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:42,640
yeah let's go cheating for local games at least let's go cheating that would be

1628
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:49,320
a fun game cheaters presents let's go cheating

1629
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:54,480
I didn't mean like cheating on on did you relationship said you here and I've

1630
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,960
seen this in our no no it's coming

1631
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:01,840

01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,500
game out of for Grey's Anatomy I want to know they're they're doing it they

1633
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:10,680
actually have the ESRB little descriptor on there you know how they are starting

1634
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:16,160
to put descriptions other than just reading on and it's it's interesting

1635
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:24,040
they're ready for emo soundtrack no it's definitely not ready but yeah there's

1636
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:30,400
like you know I don't know if it's like trauma center with sex or something but

1637
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:36,440
you know I don't know like let me hear you have to stop time on the center part

1638
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:39,880
dating sim no let me let me read this real quick this is funny it's all from

1639
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:43,640
the ESRB description for Grey's Anatomy it's a story based role-playing game

1640
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:47,520
this is a storyline contains frequent references to sexual encounters between

1641
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:54,400
different characters and dialogue that contains sexual innuendo for example is

1642
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:58,240
there anyone in this hospital you're not gonna sleep with and you want to have

1643
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:01,800
sex after surgery I don't know about you but that's not a sexual innuendo that's

1644
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:06,380
you want to have sex after surgery some scenes take place soon after the

1645
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:12,520
characters have had sex dialogue also contains mine minor expletives for

1646
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:18,600
example hell and ass and references to alcohol like you me at a row no hell and

1647
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:25,920
ass alcohol this game looks like crap but they'll be funny though Grey's

1648
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:30,640
Anatomy Grey's Anatomy the game amazing hey I gotta read some comments from the

1649
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:35,120
chat about you and you and Nelly and the way you play Animal Crossing cuz they

1650
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:39,040

01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:45,520
traveling and its effects let's see press start says Tom Nook is gonna break

1652
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,400
her legs Tiger Claw says you better do what your wife says Loki you don't want

1653
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:53,760
to have a divorce over the Wii and SSJ 100 Matt wonders aloud why does Nelly

1654
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:59,040
have to cock block us and SSJ 100 Matt also makes this very winner comment

1655
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:12,160
about the way you play Animal Crossing

1656
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:16,360
cuz they don't have to go new change the actual date on your system you can

1657
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:22,720
actually change the date in the game which is nice also I was trying I was

1658
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:29,880
going to ask if you got a blue phone box in your town no we don't have a blue

1659
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:35,480
phone box it has TARDIS dark to see us as Rocky or picture shows on Xbox Live

1660
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:40,840
Netflix anything to look for that did you know that I'm not sure I didn't know

1661
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:45,080
this until today but you can actually change out what bed you have in your

1662
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:52,200
attic can you yes with any bed and by Tony dude I'm totally putting the regal

1663
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:58,040
bed in my attic I wish I could decorate my damn attic I'm tired of my attic

1664
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:03,880
looking like wood to the bottom of your bed and it will allow you to change it

1665
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:09,360
there should just be like misty says she's a screw that I wanted I want to

1666
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:14,000
TARDIS I want to have my house be a TARDIS I'm kind of surprised they're not

1667
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,160
trying to nickel-and-dime us yet in Animal Crossing with releasing the you

1668
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:21,120
know stuff you have to pay for that you can get I bet Nelly do that they're not

1669
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:27,280
that smart though that's the problem though with you know because here's the

1670
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:31,160
thing is if they have that kind of content would be paid unlock content and

1671
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:34,080
if they have that in the game someone would figure out how to hack it and

1672
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:39,600
unlock it already because we'll do that or like maybe okay the old school

1673
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:42,960
Nintendo games like maybe just have the ones that I have on my virtual console

1674
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,920
I don't know I guess I like this kind of dumb forget it never forget I said

1675
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,920
anything all right let's let's get that statement of the show that we encourage

1676
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:56,040
you to participate with our show every week by sending us emails mailbag at

1677
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:59,680
orange lounge radio.com and the dark soccer is gonna open up the mailbag I am

1678
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:04,040
a few of her yes you are you better once you're gonna read a few of her favorite

1679
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:10,280
emails right now I will subject her to watching really bad movies on Netflix I

1680
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:14,200
watched manos the hands of fate here's the thing I watched a documentary today

1681
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:18,120
because I love Netflix for obscure fucking documentaries I watched one on

1682
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:22,520
the 50 worst movies ever made man that's the hands of fate number one it didn't

1683
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:26,160
even make the top 50 it didn't I will say this though this is awesome and

1684
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:32,080
even in Time magazine instantly made me think of Loki number 11 I think it was

1685
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:36,120
was some karate movie I don't remember the name of it I'll have to find it but

1686
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:43,480
the trick was the one dude had no arms and the other dude had no legs awesome

1687
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:49,000
and they were actually karate fighting in the movie it was amazing I have to

1688
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,320
figure out what I have to figure out what freakin movie it was maybe

1689
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:57,440
something in channel no but it was did they tie themselves together I don't

1690
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:01,000
know themselves together made like a one person they like that character in

1691
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,860
thrill-kill kind of sort of they were actually fighting with henchmen and it

1692
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:09,040
was it was amazing I mean these are so bad fucking movies

1693
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:13,400
is again the worst 150 worst movies ever made it was number one number

1694
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:18,040
Number one had some long ass titles from the 60s, something like, it was like a musical

1695
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:19,040
about zombies.

1696
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,040
Who put out the, um...

1697
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:21,160
I have to see this.

1698
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,500
I don't know who put it out.

1699
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:26,520
I have to say this, the documentary itself wasn't that good, but the, and I love it.

1700
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,520
I want to see the movie, screw the documentary.

1701
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,960
Yeah, I know, I just want to see the movie.

1702
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,960
Why is not Manos The Hands of Fate on there?

1703
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:34,960
I don't know.

1704
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,520
Is that because they MST3K'd it?

1705
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,080
I will say Howard the Duck was on it.

1706
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:39,580
Howard the Duck was on it?

1707
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:40,580
As was Ishtar.

1708
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:42,960
I love Howard the Duck.

1709
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,640
That's one of my favorite, was Xanadu on there.

1710
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:47,240
Xanadu was on there.

1711
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:48,240
No!

1712
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,640
I love Xanadu!

1713
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:52,040
Yeah, I don't know how Manos The Hands of Fate wasn't on here.

1714
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,080
It was a pretty poorly done documentary.

1715
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:58,400
Maybe they only had access to one studio's films or something, but yeah, I gotta figure

1716
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,400
out what that, what the name of that movie was.

1717
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:01,400
Hold on, I'm getting it right now.

1718
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,400
Okay.

1719
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,400
I'll have the...

1720
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:04,880
If you say the name, I'll remember it.

1721
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:05,880
Okay.

1722
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,880
DarkSaga, recent emails.

1723
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,880
I'm going to play music again because we got on a tangent.

1724
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:09,880
Surprise!

1725
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:10,880
Fighting Life!

1726
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:11,880
No, that wasn't the name of it.

1727
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:15,360
It says The Crippled, oh, The Crippled Masters.

1728
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,360
That's it.

1729
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:17,360
The Crippled Masters.

1730
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,360
That's what it was called.

1731
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:19,360
The Crippled Masters.

1732
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,360
Fighting Life is the sequel, I guess.

1733
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,000
Amazing.

1734
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
It had a sequel?

1735
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Fuck.

1736
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,080
The Crippled Masters.

1737
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,280
That's what it was called.

1738
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,200
How about some emails?

1739
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:32,200
How about it?

1740
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,000
Dun dun dun!

1741
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
This comes from GS68.

1742
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Hey O.L.R.

1743
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Crew.

1744
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1745
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

1746
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Oh no!

1747
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
In return!

1748
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,720
In The Crippled Masters, they actually attached themselves to each other to create that person

1749
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:49,640
that I was saying they should do it.

1750
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,200
That's awesome.

1751
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:55,480
It says right here, so the two men are disfigured by their evil leader.

1752
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:58,880
It says one man has his arms cut off, the other has his legs burned off with acid.

1753
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,880
The two men are enemies but struggling with being disabled.

1754
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:06,840
One day, fighting each other, the wise old yoga master suggests they work together and

1755
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:16,400
start training with weapons and team up to help them with the help of a shoulder harness

1756
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:21,360
so that the man without the use of gloves lays or he meets the army for the other man

1757
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,560
and vice versa.

1758
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,640
Three words better than Voltron.

1759
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:27,640
That's awesome.

1760
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:33,680
Okay, I'm watching this scene where they cut his arms off and this is pretty bad.

1761
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:35,080
I like it.

1762
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:36,560
I have no arms.

1763
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,960
Lowkey, you promise not to interrupt the emails now.

1764
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,800
Alright, here we go.

1765
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:41,800
Ew!

1766
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:42,800
God, that is disgusting.

1767
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:43,800
Okay.

1768
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:44,800
I'm sorry.

1769
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:45,800
Here we go.

1770
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:46,800
One more time.

1771
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,340
Oh, I have a question actually, Rob.

1772
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:50,240
Was The House Where Evil Dwells on there?

1773
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,800
I don't remember.

1774
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:52,800
I don't think so.

1775
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,800
That's the movie?

1776
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:57,040
They had some really fucked up movie from the 70s though that was like just a total

1777
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:00,080
gore film and had titties and butts and blood and stuff.

1778
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,080
I don't remember what the name was.

1779
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:02,080
It was awful.

1780
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,080
I love The House Where Evil Dwells.

1781
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:04,080
Okay.

1782
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,080
I have a little story about this and then I'll do email.

1783
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,080
Promise.

1784
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,080
Promise.

1785
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:08,080
Promise.

1786
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,080
I love what Act Deaf said in chat.

1787
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,680
The Crippled Masters of Independent Podcasting.

1788
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:13,000
No, that might be offensive though.

1789
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,360
There are people that are actually handicapped.

1790
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:17,760
There are actually crippled masters out there who do podcasts.

1791
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:21,460
But you have to admit it's an awesome idea for a movie.

1792
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:22,880
It's not that the people have no...

1793
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,600
But the fact that it's like that...

1794
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:29,320
What was that movie with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder where one was deaf and one was...

1795
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:30,840
See No Evil Here No Evil.

1796
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,200
It's like that but karate.

1797
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:33,560
Okay, sorry Jamie.

1798
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:36,160
Your point.

1799
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:37,160
Okay.

1800
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:38,160
So this movie...

1801
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:39,160
It was...

1802
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,160
Okay.

1803
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,020
I saw it when I was like six.

1804
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,020
Something like that.

1805
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,020
And it was on Showtime.

1806
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,580
Back when Showtime was new.

1807
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:50,520
And it was at the time called The House Where Evil Dwells and I had no idea that was the

1808
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:51,520
name of it.

1809
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:56,400
I just remembered that it's about these people that move to Japan and get possessed by ghosts

1810
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,740
and end up killing each other.

1811
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:01,480
Like the ghosts killed each other.

1812
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:04,620
And I had been trying for years.

1813
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:07,400
I mean decades to find this movie.

1814
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:08,880
I did not remember the name of it.

1815
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,120
I was so little I didn't remember.

1816
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:15,700
But I remembered scenes from it including the ghost possessed crabs chasing the girl

1817
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:16,760
at the tree.

1818
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:18,640
Which is why evil alien crabs always...

1819
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:20,560
Giant alien crabs always make me crack the fuck up.

1820
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,120
Because I always remember they go to ROAR sound.

1821
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:27,080
But you know like you hear like the...

1822
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:30,720
For lack of a better description I guess like the Japanese ghost noise.

1823
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:33,320
You know that sounds like really deep.

1824
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:34,320
You know.

1825
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,320
Anyway.

1826
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:36,320
No.

1827
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:39,680
That's a broken neck ghost woman.

1828
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:43,680
And that's more like...

1829
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:44,680
Anyway.

1830
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:45,680
This show's terrible.

1831
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:46,680
So.

1832
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,680
Shut up.

1833
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:48,680
Anyway.

1834
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:49,680
So.

1835
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:50,680
So.

1836
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:51,680
At last.

1837
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:54,000
I think six months ago I finally.

1838
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,600
Finally found a review of the damn movie.

1839
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:59,440
Found the name of it and bought it on Amazon for five bucks.

1840
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,680
And I'm making you watch it with me.

1841
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:03,320
No.

1842
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:04,880
You want some stuff that's gonna do with me?

1843
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,280
Okay but we have to find the cheerleader movie that was on that list and watch that too because

1844
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:09,280
that looked amazing.

1845
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:11,440
I want to see a cheerleader movie.

1846
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:12,440
Alright.

1847
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:13,440
Do we get to...

1848
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:14,440
No.

1849
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:15,440
Are they naked?

1850
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:16,440
Can we do email now?

1851
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,440
Sure.

1852
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:23,440
But you totally need to see this movie.

1853
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:24,440
Okay.

1854
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:25,440
God.

1855
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:30,320
So.

1856
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,320
First email from GS68.

1857
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:36,200
Hey OLR crew.

1858
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:40,960
If you've already covered what I just brought up in the subject line just ignore this email.

1859
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:45,360
But anyways Sunnyvale Goughland is holding a location test for the North American version

1860
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:49,840
of DJ Max Technica sometime next week.

1861
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:54,080
Somewhere in the December 17th to 19th range and I thought I'd share this with you guys.

1862
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:58,760
Kudos to Corey Vertu from BimaniStyle for bringing this up.

1863
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:02,240
I'm texting Shane right now to get a reaction out of him because I don't know anyone that

1864
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,640
loves this game more than him and he's going to be pissed.

1865
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:09,200
I encourage people living in NorCal who are interested in Technica to come check it out.

1866
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:15,600
GS68 PS this email was brought to you by Tetris the Grandmaster, home of the ending Tetrominoes.

1867
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:16,600
Okay.

1868
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:17,600
I.

1869
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,600
Okay.

1870
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,600
So DJ Max.

1871
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:21,600
Yo.

1872
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:26,120
Have you seen this new one yet?

1873
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:27,440
I'm curious to check it out.

1874
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:28,800
Shane made me watch YouTubes of it.

1875
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:29,800
It looks interesting.

1876
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:30,800
Yeah.

1877
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:31,800
With the whole like, with the touch.

1878
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:33,440
It doesn't look anything like the PSP one to me.

1879
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,440
It's just the same music.

1880
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:38,280
I'd be curious to check it out.

1881
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:39,400
So moving forward.

1882
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:42,120
I might have to make, I don't have any plans next weekend.

1883
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:43,120
Okay.

1884
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:45,120
Actually I have plans.

1885
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:46,120
Cancel them.

1886
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:48,500
I'm going to Old Folsom and eating good food.

1887
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:49,500
And shopping.

1888
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,280
I'm going to eat good food and shop in the bay and play DJ Max.

1889
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:53,720
Who are you going with?

1890
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:54,720
Becky.

1891
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,720
Bring Becky.

1892
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:58,720
She's not into video games.

1893
01:58:58,720 --> 01:58:59,720
Oh.

1894
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:00,720
Damn her.

1895
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:01,720
I'm just kidding.

1896
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:02,720
That and she has a child.

1897
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:03,720
All right.

1898
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:04,720
Fair enough.

1899
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:05,720
Who is teething.

1900
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,360
Oh my God.

1901
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,360
So moving forward.

1902
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:09,360
Hey guys.

1903
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:10,360
Loki.

1904
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:14,520
A few episodes back you said that Wii music is for five year olds.

1905
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:15,840
I object.

1906
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:20,280
My recently turned six brother loves to play video games and not only games.

1907
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:22,340
He plays Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.

1908
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:26,220
He strums and he yells at me to press the buttons while we work our way through Slow

1909
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:27,680
Ride.

1910
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:29,720
There's your lol for the day.

1911
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:30,720
P.S.

1912
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:31,720
Skye.

1913
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:36,000
Put the podcast up faster.

1914
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
P.P.S.

1915
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,320
I hope I pass the grammar Nazi test.

1916
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:40,960
This is Orange Lounge.

1917
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:41,960
Geekboy2424.

1918
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,560
Think of it this way.

1919
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:45,400
You're going to get an awesome Christmas present pretty soon.

1920
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:48,120
Put in an ellipsis where you're not supposed to by the way.

1921
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:52,920
You're supposed to use two dashes and not an ellipsis.

1922
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:55,120
I'll take care of that later.

1923
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:56,480
No lecture tonight.

1924
01:59:56,480 --> 02:00:00,040
However, the last email is fantastic grammar.

1925
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,040
I find it beautiful.

1926
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:05,680
It actually is a card sent to us.

1927
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:11,320
It's actually sent to us from our friends at Super Happy Fun Time Show.

1928
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:14,760
Super Happy Fun Time Show?

1929
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:15,760
I hate that show.

1930
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:16,760
No, I'm kidding.

1931
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:17,760
It's great.

1932
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:21,520
Please find attached our Christmas to you all at O.O.R.

1933
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:26,240
We're not sending analog versions out as we're trying to save the planet.

1934
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:30,640
Have a great Christmas and New Year and we'll see you on the other side, whatever that means.

1935
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:34,120
That's a very creative idea to do your Christmas cards digitally.

1936
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:35,920
So I would like to see some holiday cards.

1937
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:37,960
I don't want to say Christmas because that's insensitive.

1938
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:41,800
I want Christmas cards.

1939
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:45,840
I want it fucking loaded with baby Jesus.

1940
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,720
Okay, then fine.

1941
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:53,000
For this week's mailbag, we would like to challenge you to send us Christmas cards and

1942
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,880
they better be about Christmas and Jesus and Santa and all that stuff.

1943
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:03,960
Unless you want to do them about original Christmas and that's with yule logs burning

1944
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:07,000
and candles on trees and druids sacrificing things.

1945
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Fine, look, whatever.

1946
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,400
We want your Christmas cards via email this week.

1947
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:13,280
So mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

1948
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:14,280
I like that.

1949
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:17,040
And your banners for the PSP website, damn it.

1950
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:20,880
VXJ6V, yes, that's a creative idea because I'm not talking about someone signing on to

1951
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,840
like Yahoo greeting cards or whatever.

1952
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:23,840
I'm talking about they actually...

1953
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:26,200
We want you to get into Photoshop and make it your damn self.

1954
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:29,040
Yeah, they made one and let me, maybe I should make that clear because I don't want to see

1955
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,480
the same damn e-card over and over.

1956
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:34,240
They actually made a Photoshop little card that was cute.

1957
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,240
It was.

1958
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:37,640
It was very nice and we appreciate it very much.

1959
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:45,320
I actually mailed all of four real Christmas cards this year and they were pretty cool.

1960
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:47,440
That's it for emails, I think.

1961
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:48,440
Is that it?

1962
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:49,440
Nope.

1963
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:50,440
We got some spam.

1964
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:51,440
Fuck you.

1965
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,440
All confirmed at eBay.com.

1966
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:53,440
You shit.

1967
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:54,440
Done?

1968
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:56,080
All right, there you go.

1969
02:01:56,080 --> 02:02:00,120
If you want to send us emails, mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

1970
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:01,120
Back to the gaming news.

1971
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,120
Loki.

1972
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:03,120
All right.

1973
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:04,640
Well, let's see here.

1974
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:06,680
We've got some other interesting stuff.

1975
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:10,320
This is a game that I was playing quite a bit right after it came out.

1976
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:15,800
I kind of put it off now since I have other things to be playing, but I want to go back

1977
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:18,880
and maybe this will entice me.

1978
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:22,020
Mercenaries 2 is getting some new download content.

1979
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:30,480
They kind of teased this a little bit a while ago with their Obama and Sarah Palin characters.

1980
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:34,560
Well, this is all going to be part of the Blow It Up Again download content pack.

1981
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:42,960
It is going to be free and it is going to contain a bunch of cool stuff, including some

1982
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,560
new modes.

1983
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,560
They're going to have four new game types, including there is one that looked like a

1984
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:58,080
death race or something like that, and some other fun explosion-based games, which is

1985
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,080
kind of cool.

1986
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:09,360
Apparently, it will be coming out on the Marketplace December 16th, so that's pretty awesome for

1987
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,360
PS3 owners.

1988
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:14,480
I think the 360 is already out.

1989
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,480
All right.

1990
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:19,920
Well, if you want to continue to expand the games that you might own, Guitar Hero World

1991
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:25,600
Tour is going to be offering five free download tracks, but only if you own the guitar bundle

1992
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:26,600
of the game.

1993
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:31,160
So not buying the game by itself, not buying the big band box, just buying guitar and game

1994
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:32,160
by itself.

1995
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:35,160
Supposedly, you're going to be getting five free songs, and here's the thing.

1996
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:38,240
It's not five pre-selected songs like it was a rock band.

1997
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:41,840
You'll just get to choose five free downloadable tracks.

1998
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:43,680
Details coming soon.

1999
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:47,280
That's all we know right now, apparently, is that if you get the $90 guitar game bundle,

2000
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:51,040
you will get to choose five tracks to download.

2001
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:54,840
And I guess free is good, but it's kind of weird that they're doing it for just the guitar

2002
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:55,840
bundle.

2003
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,480
Does that strike anyone else as odd?

2004
02:03:57,480 --> 02:03:58,480
Yeah.

2005
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:01,240
I think they're desperate because people already have guitars.

2006
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:02,240
You know what?

2007
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:05,720
I actually almost bought Guitar Hero World Tour.

2008
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:08,880
Every song in the song list that I really, really wanted to play was pretty much already

2009
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:09,880
in rock band.

2010
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:10,880
I feel bad.

2011
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,400
I feel like rock band's so much better than Guitar Hero.

2012
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:17,500
I mean, it's so much more versatile, has a lot more tracks to play.

2013
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:20,160
We met some real nice people that worked on Guitar Hero at PAX.

2014
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:21,160
That is true.

2015
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:26,360
But one thing I am excited about, though, is the music mixer.

2016
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:27,640
The studio mode.

2017
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:28,640
It's limited.

2018
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:29,640
Really?

2019
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:30,640
Yeah.

2020
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:32,360
So, I don't know.

2021
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:33,360
It's...

2022
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:34,360
We'll see.

2023
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:36,720
Maybe when it comes down in price a little bit.

2024
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,880
I think the price is one thing I'm having a hard time justifying.

2025
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,480
I do really need a new guitar, though.

2026
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:42,840
In fact, I was playing the No Doubt stuff in rock band.

2027
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:46,040
Maybe if they get better downloads, too, I'd be on board.

2028
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:48,140
No Doubt has that album, right?

2029
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:50,280
And my roommate was watching me play it and was like, ah, it's too bad you don't have

2030
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:51,280
a second guitar.

2031
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:52,280
I actually want to play rock band right now.

2032
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:53,280
This is pretty cool.

2033
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:56,840
And I'm like, oh, I need to get a second guitar anyway, because I'm still using the Explorer.

2034
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,840
Still.

2035
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:01,360
And TigerClaw says, why buy the game when SingStar Abba was all you cared for?

2036
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:05,640
I can't believe I left that out of my gaming week, but I did play SingStar Abba last night.

2037
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:06,640
It was a lot of fun.

2038
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:07,640
Mm-hmm.

2039
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:08,640
Yep, yep.

2040
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:11,640
There you go.

2041
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:17,280
Well, this is definitely for the UK.

2042
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:21,040
In February, Rise of the Argonauts is going to be coming out.

2043
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:27,600
It's an action role play game that's being put out by Codemasters.

2044
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:38,200
They're actually, it's already out on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 everywhere else in Europe.

2045
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:45,600
However, the UK version had some problems with actually having space for the game.

2046
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:48,600
It really was only a retail issue.

2047
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:53,360
The publisher actually said that they tried to get it into retail in the UK, along with

2048
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:58,720
the others, but it was so busy they could not do it, so they actually delayed the UK

2049
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:01,880
launch, simply for retail reasons.

2050
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:08,000
It actually was supposed to be out in the US on February 16th, and everybody else as

2051
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
of Friday.

2052
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Hmm.

2053
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
All righty.

2054
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Cool.

2055
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:21,040
Let's see, you may remember back, man, I can't believe it's already been like over a year,

2056
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:28,060
but Bioshock, they had some limited editions that came out that had the Bioshock Big Daddy

2057
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:29,760
figurine with it.

2058
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:36,560
Well, now to go with the Big Daddy is A Little Sister, and you'll actually be able to purchase

2059
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:37,560
these.

2060
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:43,360
They're from the Cult of Rapture, I'm not sure if they're actually being sold through

2061
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:48,800
the website or not, but yeah, it's going to be a little sister figurine that will go along

2062
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,280
with it.

2063
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:54,320
That's kind of neat.

2064
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:59,520
No word on pricing or when it's going to be available, but soon I guess.

2065
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,240
All right.

2066
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:06,920
Hey, something that's available, Pac-Man is coming out on the mobile phones, and here's

2067
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:11,200
the interesting thing, it just came out in Europe, apparently, it's a mobile version.

2068
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:17,920
256 levels, because the original arcade version also cracked out after 256 levels, but what's

2069
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:23,360
cool about this, the mobile game actually supports local matches via Bluetooth, and

2070
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:26,320
remember the awesome game Pac-Man Versus, and what was so awesome about that?

2071
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:30,360
You could play as the ghost, you can do that in this mobile version as well.

2072
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:36,760
Now here's the thing, there is that kind of like fog or limited vision on the mobile phone,

2073
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:40,760
but you know what, still kind of awesome.

2074
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:45,240
So there you go, if you're a mobile gamer and looking for a game to get, being able

2075
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:48,440
to play as the ghost definitely puts a whole new twist on Pac-Man, so that's available

2076
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:52,600
right now in Europe, and I'm sure we'll come over here soon.

2077
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:59,120
Well here's some happy news for Nintendo fans in the States, the DSi is supposed to be coming

2078
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:04,880
to North America in March 2009, which we knew we'd be getting it, I mean it's not like they

2079
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:09,120
wouldn't release it over here, but it's kind of nice to have a date, don't you think?

2080
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:12,560
It's already out in Japan, and so we've been hearing all about it, and I'm sure people

2081
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:17,000
have imported it already, but now you don't have to, if you have patience.

2082
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Patience.

2083
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,120
It's a virtue.

2084
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:24,160
Sadly, I'm not virtuous, but oh well, I have to because I'm poor.

2085
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:26,520
I want it now, Daddy!

2086
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:27,960
Do you want the goose that lays a golden egg?

2087
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:31,520
I want a goose that lays a golden egg!

2088
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:35,880
And it's also a very stressful episode on Wonder Shosen.

2089
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:38,960
Patience, patience, patience, patience, patience.

2090
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:41,200
God, I love Wonder Shosen.

2091
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:42,200
I'm so sad that show only went.

2092
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:43,200
Never watched any.

2093
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:44,960
Oh, Jamie, you are missing out.

2094
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,960
Okay, if you're going to make me watch your crappy movie, I'm making you watch Wonder

2095
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:48,960
Shosen.

2096
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:49,960
Hey!

2097
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:50,960
It is a crappy movie, but it is fun-crappy.

2098
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:53,680
It's the hot dog highway!

2099
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:55,240
Daddy!

2100
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:56,920
Mortimer!

2101
02:08:56,920 --> 02:09:05,960
Anyways, there's a new game coming out called Treasure Trove, which is kind of an interesting

2102
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:06,960
name.

2103
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:11,880
Basically, it's a game coming over from Asper Software, and what's unique about this game

2104
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:16,840
though is it's sort of got a little bit of an augmented reality twist to it.

2105
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:22,760
Basically, you'll play this game actually walking around, and it will pick up on Wi-Fi

2106
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:25,600
signals that are nearby.

2107
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:30,520
And based on those Wi-Fi signals, it will kind of create treasures for you to be able

2108
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:31,600
to collect.

2109
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:34,900
So you can actually walk around different places and find different treasures.

2110
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:37,340
It's like a real-life treasure hunt, I guess.

2111
02:09:37,340 --> 02:09:42,960
You might also remember that I want to say Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops did something

2112
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:46,320
similar to that effect as well.

2113
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:53,680
In fact, I think you could get different unlockable characters based on Wi-Fi spots.

2114
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:54,680
So that's kind of neat.

2115
02:09:54,680 --> 02:10:01,040
I don't know if I like the fact that I have to walk around to find these Wi-Fi spots,

2116
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:06,520
but neat nonetheless.

2117
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:07,520
Kind of interesting.

2118
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:11,400
Is this kind of like the whole, what do they call it, geocaching thing?

2119
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:14,880
Sort of, but not quite as cool.

2120
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:20,200
Tigerclaw says, I bet the treasures are actually just open Wi-Fi networks.

2121
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:22,280
That would be a treasure.

2122
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:28,040
Hey, one more story about an announcement, possible announcement, coming to Consumer

2123
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:29,040
Electronics Show.

2124
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:30,040
This could be some big gaming news.

2125
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:37,080
It's just a rumor, however it's coming from a research analyst for the firm Global Equities.

2126
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:43,800
Apparently Microsoft could be unveiling a Zune phone at Consumer Electronics Show.

2127
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:47,200
Apparently the Zune phone, you can guess what it's probably trying to compete with, but

2128
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:49,080
it's supposed to have motion enhancement features.

2129
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:53,200
It would actually have an accelerometer in it, a large multimedia screen in it, and a

2130
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:56,560
keyboard I guess that is on the screen.

2131
02:10:56,560 --> 02:11:00,040
Now of course, the interesting thing about it is that although nothing is really said

2132
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:03,680
about gaming right away, you would think, especially with the way the other big phone

2133
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:07,920
is going, and especially because Microsoft has that tie into the 360, and they've always

2134
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:10,360
talked about that whole live anywhere thing.

2135
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:14,960
And they also showed off those downloadable XNA titles to the Zune.

2136
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:20,720
This would be really a great bridge between all that, especially with so many community

2137
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:21,720
games.

2138
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:26,000
The community thing has really exploded out there, and grad store buddy Aaron, who appears

2139
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,880
to still be in the top 15 of the games on the community games, amongst all the stuff

2140
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:32,760
that's out there right now, props to him.

2141
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:35,680
But that would be very interesting if all these XNA games could suddenly be playable

2142
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:36,680
on the phone.

2143
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:40,560
It's like they'd have this huge base of already made things.

2144
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:41,560
Excellent idea.

2145
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:42,560
We'll see.

2146
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:46,480
Although, I don't know, if they actually put out a Zune phone, would that be something you'd

2147
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:47,480
be interested in, Loki?

2148
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:49,240
Because I know you're like an Apple hater.

2149
02:11:49,240 --> 02:11:52,880
You know, Dark Soccer and I already have iPhones, so I can pretty much guess Dark Soccer would

2150
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:56,360
have the same answer I would, that I'm locked into this phone for two years, even if I wanted

2151
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:57,360
one, I couldn't get it.

2152
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,800
But you, Loki, would you be interested?

2153
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:04,280
Not really, because usually with those plans for a phone like that, they have data plans,

2154
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:06,280
and it's expensive.

2155
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:10,800
I don't use my phone for browsing the internet and stuff, although I would probably like

2156
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,880
doing that, because it would come in handy sometimes.

2157
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:17,660
But it would all depend.

2158
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:23,320
Maybe if they made a standalone Zune player that also played games, and you can download

2159
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:26,720
stuff maybe not the phone, then I might be interested in it.

2160
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:31,840
But it's not something I'm actually going to purchase as a phone.

2161
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:35,900
Rama in chat says, OK, Microsoft, you already have smartphones and Pocket PC's phones that

2162
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:36,900
are on the market.

2163
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:38,280
That's a whole lot better than iPhones.

2164
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:41,840
You don't need a damn Zune phone.

2165
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:42,840
We'll see.

2166
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:44,640
All right.

2167
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:47,720
That does it for stories tonight, and we'll get to some last minute stories in just a

2168
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:48,720
moment.

2169
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:52,400
But we are going to open up the Skype line right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username

2170
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:53,760
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2171
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:56,320
If you wanted to call and talk about the show tonight, please give us a call.

2172
02:12:56,320 --> 02:13:00,360
We're only going to take a couple calls tonight, because we want to make sure we have time

2173
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:03,720
after the show for the Justin TV thing with Tatsunoko and Capcom.

2174
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:07,720
So we're going to try to abbreviate this so we get Loki home on time and not in trouble.

2175
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:08,720
And then I just want to...

2176
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:09,720
Well, I appreciate that.

2177
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,720
We don't need to do that.

2178
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:11,720
I don't want to stay up all night either.

2179
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:12,720
So...

2180
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:13,720
It's freaking cold in here.

2181
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:14,720
It is very cold in here.

2182
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:17,720
So yeah, we're going to just take a couple quick calls while we're waiting for a call.

2183
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:19,720
Loki, you want to do some last minute stories?

2184
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:20,720
Yes.

2185
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:27,040
There's a weird game that this company is showing off.

2186
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:30,080
3D-AUS has a game called Funny Band.

2187
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:35,840
It's a Korean developer that's put it out, and it has a peripheral that combines both

2188
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:38,120
a keyboard, a guitar, and drum set.

2189
02:13:38,120 --> 02:13:40,440
Now, you may ask, how the hell are they doing that?

2190
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:43,360
Well, the guitar looks kind of like a rock band guitar.

2191
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:46,960
It has four frets on top, two frets on the bottom.

2192
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:50,740
And then also on that, there are two sets of keys.

2193
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:56,920
There's four keys on the bottom and three keys on the top, kind of, of the base of the

2194
02:13:56,920 --> 02:13:57,920
guitar.

2195
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:01,220
And you flip the guitar over, and there's six drum pads.

2196
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:02,680
So that's kind of neat.

2197
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:05,920
And the game itself kind of looks a little bit like, you know, a guitar hero or a rock

2198
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:06,920
band.

2199
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:13,000
But what's kind of cool is the actual board that the notes scroll down is kind of curved.

2200
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:18,160
So it's like, kind of, I don't know, the end of, like, Splash Mountain or something.

2201
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:22,440
But the game itself looks kind of cool, and no word on exactly when it's coming out.

2202
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:28,440
But very neat, and a good way, I guess, to have all your peripherals in one spot.

2203
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:31,880
Sucks that you can't play drums and guitar though at the same time, not without it being

2204
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:36,200
very uncomfortable.

2205
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:41,640
Something else that's coming out, Brutal Legend, of course, was shown off during the Video

2206
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:43,920
Game Awards show tonight.

2207
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:46,600
And EA is now bringing that game out.

2208
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:53,200
Of course, this used to be one of the properties of Nvidia before they got bought up by Activision.

2209
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:59,440
And now EA is putting out yet another game, a little bit different, not going to see Brutal

2210
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:05,680
Legend, you know, 2010 or something like that, but neat nonetheless.

2211
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:08,600
And then we were talking a little bit before about DJ Max Technica.

2212
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:12,280
Well, DJ Max Technica is actually coming to the DS.

2213
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:17,280
And they're going to be doing a DS game that's going to also have some DSi features as well.

2214
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:22,060
It's going to also use a DSi camera and have storage support, which is kind of cool.

2215
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:25,600
But very cool to see that this is going to be coming to the DS.

2216
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:30,280
I guess it'd be perfect since it's a touchscreen game, and the PSP versions have done very

2217
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:31,280
well as well.

2218
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:34,880
All right, now we're finally getting calls, because apparently our Skype was on Don't

2219
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,880
Disturb or something, and I finally figured that out thanks to a chat comment.

2220
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:39,320
And to reset it, now we've got a call.

2221
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:40,640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2222
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:41,640
Who's this?

2223
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:42,640
Hello, Orange Launch Radio.

2224
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:43,640
It is Jason.

2225
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:44,640
Hello, Jason.

2226
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,320
I come from the internet.

2227
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:48,440
I was getting a little worried that no one was going to call tonight.

2228
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:51,280
I was like, that's a little embarrassing, but then I realized...

2229
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:56,440
You were online the whole time, ever since you came on to do the tossover with Bobby.

2230
02:15:56,440 --> 02:16:02,480
Yeah, usually we turn it off for the first hour and a half, but I got lazy tonight.

2231
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:03,480
Well what's up, Jason?

2232
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:05,160
Oh, not too much.

2233
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:07,480
Just chilling in three degree weather.

2234
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:08,480
Just chilling.

2235
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:12,300
That's what it feels like here, even though it'd probably kill us if we told you how cold

2236
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:13,400
it actually is here.

2237
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,680
You'd probably be like, you're fucking babies.

2238
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:16,680
For the record...

2239
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:17,680
It's okay.

2240
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:21,320
This weather would have frozen me if I had still lived in Arizona at the time, so I could

2241
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:22,320
definitely understand.

2242
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:25,320
47 degrees out, by the way.

2243
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:26,320
Whips.

2244
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:27,320
Whips.

2245
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:29,040
That's what, a Colorado summer?

2246
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:30,040
All right, no, I'm kidding.

2247
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:31,760
What's up, Jason?

2248
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:32,760
That's it.

2249
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:34,800
That's pretty close, actually.

2250
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:38,120
I have had notes open ever since the start of the show.

2251
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:39,120
Home.

2252
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:41,120
Hooray, home.

2253
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:45,640
It's funny, because when you said that this was something that was popular in the 90s,

2254
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:48,680
all of these memories came fluttering back.

2255
02:16:48,680 --> 02:16:51,880
There was two things that stood out.

2256
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:54,600
One of them was a company called World's 3D that...

2257
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:56,880
I remember World's 3D.

2258
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:57,880
I never...

2259
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:02,440
The sad thing is I've never actually used any of these 3D World products back then.

2260
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:03,600
I didn't have my own computer.

2261
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:04,600
I was young.

2262
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:06,440
I didn't know nearly as much as I do now.

2263
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:08,720
You know, that kind of stuff.

2264
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:12,680
World's 3D came out and tried to do this.

2265
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:19,960
I don't know if that's what ZDNet, the precursor to Tech TV, if that's what ZDTV spotlighted

2266
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:24,520
at one point, but I remember seeing a 3D interface for web browsing.

2267
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:25,800
And you know what?

2268
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:28,560
It doesn't work.

2269
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:29,660
It's slow.

2270
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:33,040
We have a great interface for browsing the web.

2271
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:34,800
They're called web browsers.

2272
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:37,120
It presents everything in a great medium.

2273
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:40,280
What a concept.

2274
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:42,600
So you think home is just stupid, or what?

2275
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:45,080
It's...

2276
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:47,800
Bobby had it right, and I've said this to a couple people in the chat room, and I think

2277
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:50,160
you even echoed it at the same time.

2278
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:53,720
You want to compare it to Second Life, but you can't compare it to Second Life.

2279
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:58,040
Second Life is a game in the sense that you have production and you can play other people's

2280
02:17:58,040 --> 02:18:00,240
production and whatnot.

2281
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:03,240
Home is an interface to...

2282
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:10,000
I mean, it's an alternative to the XMB, you could say, with the fact that they're trying

2283
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,120
to integrate partying and game launching and that kind of stuff.

2284
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:18,600
Yes, it's a cross-media bar that says, fuck shit, nay, and fat, and all that stuff, you

2285
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:19,600
know?

2286
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:22,680
Yeah, it's another interface, and you know what?

2287
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:29,080
It's slow, and it takes forever, and it just doesn't work as well.

2288
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:30,080
That's not the...

2289
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:31,560
Well, that's natural.

2290
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:33,840
It doesn't work on the digital mediums.

2291
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:37,080
It's not that smart.

2292
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:41,280
Well, you said you've been taking notes during the show.

2293
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,160
What else did you want to comment on?

2294
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:44,200
It was just a lot of this.

2295
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:45,780
It's kind of funny.

2296
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:50,480
Some of the things that Rai pointed out was that the repeated loading and downloading

2297
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:54,800
of all of the zones in the home reminded us an awful lot of Metal Gear Solid 4, the fact

2298
02:18:54,800 --> 02:19:00,400
that you had to install more than every chapter worth of the game.

2299
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:02,040
That was aggravating.

2300
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:04,560
That was the worst thing I've ever seen in a game.

2301
02:19:04,560 --> 02:19:07,860
Did you know that Prince of Persia is the first PlayStation 3 game I've bought that

2302
02:19:07,860 --> 02:19:11,280
had to do the installation thing, and it kind of caught me off guard?

2303
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:17,120
I was like, whoa, hey, I forgot PS3 games do this, because all the other PS3 games I

2304
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:20,320
have, LittleBigPlanet didn't really do it, and it might have, but I totally didn't notice

2305
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:21,320
it.

2306
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:22,320
It did.

2307
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:23,320
It's small.

2308
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:24,320
I just didn't notice it.

2309
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:25,320
I think I was doing something wrong.

2310
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:26,320
You notice that there's no more stories about those anymore?

2311
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:28,280
It's because every game does it now.

2312
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:31,840
I was actually going to say and ask the same thing about LittleBigPlanet.

2313
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:33,580
I don't remember an install.

2314
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:37,080
It did it, but it's just kind of short, and so is the Prince of Persia one.

2315
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:41,000
You'll notice the first time you play the game, it's slow to boot up, and I was like,

2316
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,880
oh, this shit's installing on my hard drive right now, and sure enough, every time I've

2317
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:46,520
booted it since then, boop, comes right up.

2318
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,760
That's just so weird to me.

2319
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:51,440
But PC games have done this for years, right?

2320
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:53,200
That's a PC.

2321
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:56,680
The difference between a PC and a PC is that you have to support a lot.

2322
02:19:56,680 --> 02:20:02,960
In a game console, developers should already know exactly what they need to do.

2323
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:09,920
I mean, you can say the same thing for download content, but I don't know.

2324
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:14,280
It just seems really weird in the way that the PC is kind of graying out with consoles

2325
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:15,280
nowadays.

2326
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:16,640
Let me say this, Jason.

2327
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:19,360
To me, it's weird, but it's not a deal breaker.

2328
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:22,600
I can put up with it, especially if it's just once at the beginning of the thing.

2329
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:25,780
I would only be more pissed off if it kept happening throughout the whole thing, which

2330
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:27,960
it sounds like it happens in Metal Gear Solid 4.

2331
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:28,960
Oh, my God.

2332
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:34,000
And it's funny, because the first time it installs, it takes something like 10 or 20

2333
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,720
minutes, I think, if memory serves correctly.

2334
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:39,860
And then every additional time it installs, it takes about three minutes.

2335
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:41,400
And I swear to God, it's a three minute.

2336
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:44,780
When we were playing through it and Wright was watching me play, when we were playing

2337
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:47,940
through it and we would get to these stupid installs, I would say, it's a three minute

2338
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:54,000
Marlboro commercial, because Old Snake is sitting there smoking away right in your face

2339
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,680
for three minutes, and nothing else is going on.

2340
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:00,280
He's just sitting there huffing and puffing.

2341
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:01,280
Comment from chat.

2342
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:04,760
Legend of Zaku says, bullshit, PC games installed faster than PS3 games.

2343
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:08,240
I got three words for you, Final Fantasy XI.

2344
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:11,160
You can't count download time.

2345
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:12,480
Download patches and updates towards that level.

2346
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:15,280
Well, even the game itself spawns across like four CDs.

2347
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:16,280
It's crazy.

2348
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:17,280
I don't even remember.

2349
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:18,280
All right, forget it.

2350
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:19,280
It doesn't matter.

2351
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:20,280
It's been too long.

2352
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:21,880
I understand the point he's trying to make, that some of those PS3 installs are very long,

2353
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:22,880
but you know.

2354
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:25,880
Anyway, Jason, I've got to rush you along, because we've got to take some more calls.

2355
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:28,080
Is there anything else you want to comment on tonight?

2356
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:33,060
One thing that I do want to say for myself, as much as I have a disdain for it, I think

2357
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:35,760
everything we say about home is a preview.

2358
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:36,760
It's not a review.

2359
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:40,260
There's very little content in there, and until we can start seeing things like clubs

2360
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:44,680
really happening, and club houses, and anything else that they actually do decide to sell,

2361
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:48,480
as soon as it's actually flourishing, it's a preview.

2362
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:52,940
But Jason, when you open it up to the masses like Sony has, that's not how everybody's

2363
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:53,940
going to view it.

2364
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:55,940
People are going to download this and go, this is home?

2365
02:21:55,940 --> 02:21:56,940
This is bullshit.

2366
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:57,940
And they're not going to look at it again.

2367
02:21:57,940 --> 02:22:02,440
They've shrugged it off as the whole beta thing, but...

2368
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:04,800
I mean, they've pushed it to the cross-media bar.

2369
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,800
You have a point.

2370
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:06,800
It's right there.

2371
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:07,800
Yeah.

2372
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:08,800
Yeah.

2373
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:11,440
It definitely popped up as soon as I found out that it was open for everybody.

2374
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:12,440
I don't know.

2375
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:14,720
I stand by my comment, but I certainly understand yours.

2376
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:18,920
Okay, Jason, I think home is going to be one of those things that's a lot cooler in a year.

2377
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:24,100
It's like the PS3 itself, it's not going to realize its potential for like a year.

2378
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:25,100
That's a good point.

2379
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:28,920
Well, Lord knows we didn't buy our PS3 until recently, because the library, we didn't care

2380
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:29,920
about it.

2381
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:30,920
Yeah.

2382
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:34,800
We didn't have a need for Blu-Ray, which has also changed now, Blu-Ray movies, that

2383
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:35,800
is.

2384
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:36,800
Yeah, yeah.

2385
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,800
All right.

2386
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:39,800
Well, Jason, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank you

2387
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:42,040
so much for the call tonight, and you have a good one.

2388
02:22:42,040 --> 02:22:43,040
Bye, guys.

2389
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:44,040
All right.

2390
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,040
Bye-bye.

2391
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:48,160
All right, if you want to give us a call, we'll do at least one more call, try to sneak

2392
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:49,160
two in.

2393
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:52,840
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2394
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:55,680
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2395
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:56,680
Who's this?

2396
02:22:56,680 --> 02:22:57,680
Hey, hey.

2397
02:22:57,680 --> 02:22:58,680
It's your buddy from New York, Rama.

2398
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:00,440
Well, hello, buddy from New York, Rama.

2399
02:23:00,440 --> 02:23:01,440
How you doing?

2400
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:02,440
I'm pretty good.

2401
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:06,720
I was cold early, but now I'm happy I'm home.

2402
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:08,280
What's on your mind?

2403
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:09,280
Not much.

2404
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:12,760
I tried to call you guys last week, but since SSJ100Man had told me you guys didn't have

2405
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:15,280
the 1-800 number, I had gone into an interesting...

2406
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:16,720
Yeah, we had issues last week.

2407
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:17,720
Sorry.

2408
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:22,520
Don't we all have issues once in a while?

2409
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:23,520
Yes.

2410
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:30,680
Yeah, but I had gone to an interesting concert last week and called Blip Fest 2008.

2411
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:32,400
I'm going to post a link in the chat.

2412
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:42,720
It's blipfestival.org, but basically, once a year, it's a concert of all types of classic

2413
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:49,640
8-bit programmers and gamers alike that program in with NES, Commodore 64, and they do all

2414
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:51,840
kinds of various music with it.

2415
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:58,520
Sorry, I've been looking at the Wii stuff for setting up for After Show.

2416
02:23:58,520 --> 02:23:59,520
I've been talking to you.

2417
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:03,800
I haven't looked at the website, but let me look.

2418
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:05,320
What convinced you to go out to the show?

2419
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:07,920
Well, a friend of mine told me about it last year.

2420
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:11,960
I couldn't get it, and I couldn't get a chance to go, but I am a big fan of Chiptunes.

2421
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:18,480
It's basically like the music that you guys play at the end of the show.

2422
02:24:18,480 --> 02:24:24,080
I don't know if you heard the shows we did live at Penny Arcade Expo, but I wonder if

2423
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:25,080
Bobby's listening.

2424
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:28,340
He'll say it in chat, but there was a guy that actually came on who did Chiptunes with

2425
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:31,760
his old-school brick Game Boy, and he was pretty rad.

2426
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:33,040
I think he came in...

2427
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:35,160
And he was playing them actually...

2428
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:37,320
It wouldn't have been the last day, because we weren't there the last day, because of

2429
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,320
our flight.

2430
02:24:38,320 --> 02:24:39,320
It was the second day.

2431
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:41,540
So look for day two of the PAX podcast.

2432
02:24:41,540 --> 02:24:42,600
We did it all games.

2433
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:46,160
And towards the end of the shows, when the guy came on, he was pretty awesome.

2434
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:47,760
Did you get his name or something like that?

2435
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:50,160
I don't remember it off the top of my head, sadly.

2436
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:53,120
I know we had it at the time, and I apologize if Bobby's listening.

2437
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:54,120
He'll remember.

2438
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:55,120
Okay.

2439
02:24:55,120 --> 02:25:01,600
Yeah, a lot of the performers on stage were actually meeting, and with Game Boys, there

2440
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:08,220
was one artist that I think his name was Nordliff, or N-R-U-S-K, actually had two Game Boys and

2441
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:14,200
basically switching back and forth through a mixer.

2442
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:17,400
You had another group I saw on Sunday called Starscream.

2443
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:21,440
Pretty much what they were doing was, you had one person on the Game Boy and another

2444
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:25,360
person on drums.

2445
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:28,720
It was just like a non-stop dance party or what?

2446
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:29,720
Something like that.

2447
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:37,840
It turned into like this awesome eight-pick electro rave, and there was a lot of crowd

2448
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:38,840
surfing.

2449
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:39,840
It was just great.

2450
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:44,360
It ran an hour late, but it was well worth it, because my favorite group was on stage,

2451
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:45,360
Onamanaguchi.

2452
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:52,200
Basically, their background beats is eight-pick, N-E-S, and you have one on drums, a lead,

2453
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:54,680
a bassist, and another guitarist.

2454
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:56,600
I just can't remember what his part was.

2455
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:59,720
Okay, I actually found it.

2456
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:03,100
Of course, somebody in chat says it right, as I find it myself, but his name was Paul

2457
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:06,320
Owens, and he's the director of the movie Reformat the Planet.

2458
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:08,680
Oh, okay, that artist wasn't there.

2459
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:09,680
Okay.

2460
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:13,760
Anyway, sorry, when you said chiptunes, I just remembered that particular performance

2461
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:14,760
was pretty awesome.

2462
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:16,680
But I know what you're talking about.

2463
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:20,840
This is kind of a big part of how 8-Bit Weapon kind of got their sound, you know?

2464
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:21,840
Definitely.

2465
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:23,720
I love 8-Bit Weapon.

2466
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:25,000
So that's cool.

2467
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,880
It's funny that this stuff's gotten bigger and bigger.

2468
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,880
Definitely.

2469
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:34,400
Now, from what I saw on Sunday, I would recommend these artists to check out.

2470
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:40,840
Starscream, Syphus, Nordloaf, and Onomatoguchi, and USK.

2471
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:42,560
Those are my five favorites.

2472
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:47,600
If you have a nostalgic 80s feel to you, Trash 80 is really good.

2473
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,600
How much did this whole thing cost you?

2474
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:52,040
Actually, it was $15.

2475
02:26:52,040 --> 02:26:54,640
It was a four-night event.

2476
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:56,600
It's $50 for all four nights.

2477
02:26:56,600 --> 02:27:01,200
If you paid $60, you get a DVD of Blitz Festival 06.

2478
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:02,560
I just went for Sunday.

2479
02:27:02,560 --> 02:27:05,600
And I just picked up 07 DVD.

2480
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:10,080
And I will tell you this, the way they remixed the music on that DVD, even if you have it

2481
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:14,920
defined almost near where no one can still hear it, it's still loud, and it's really

2482
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:15,920
good.

2483
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:16,920
All right.

2484
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:17,920
Well, it sounds like you had fun.

2485
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:19,840
I wish our phone lines had been open last week.

2486
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:20,840
Yeah.

2487
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:26,160
And half the fun was just the visuals, I mean, the guys on stage, you saw, like, flashbacks

2488
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:28,540
of 8-Bit gaming and everything.

2489
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:32,440
I got to get the pictures up soon, but I did catch one screenshot of the samurai show that

2490
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:35,420
went out on battle screen.

2491
02:27:35,420 --> 02:27:37,880
Wake me up when they have Guardian Legend.

2492
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:39,800
I didn't see any Guardian Legend.

2493
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:41,080
I'm just saying.

2494
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:42,080
I know.

2495
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:43,080
I know how much you love it.

2496
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:44,080
You know.

2497
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:45,080
It's not just me.

2498
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:46,080
Dark Sakura, too.

2499
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:47,080
Yep.

2500
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:50,600
I think Loki has a soft spot for it, too, maybe not as strong.

2501
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:54,000
The Force is not strong with him, but, you know, a little bit.

2502
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
All right.

2503
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:58,000
I'm staring at that screen, and happy fangirl is...

2504
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,000
We'll get to it.

2505
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
We'll get to it after the show.

2506
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,200
Sorry, we got Tatsunoko vs. Capcom up on the screen now.

2507
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:03,200
Finally.

2508
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,200
We're going to get to it soon.

2509
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:05,200
Rama, we've got to let you go.

2510
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:06,200
We've got to let you go.

2511
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:07,200
We've got one more call.

2512
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:08,200
All right.

2513
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:09,200
Can I say one more thing and I can get out of here?

2514
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:10,200
Of course.

2515
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:11,760
Jamie, that song, it's Pitch Black.

2516
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:16,200
It's off the MC Frontline album Secrets from the Future, so you know which one it is.

2517
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:17,200
Okay.

2518
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:18,200
Cool.

2519
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:19,200
Awesome.

2520
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:20,200
Got it.

2521
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:21,200
All righty.

2522
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:24,880
Actually, did you get a chance to check out the new album?

2523
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:27,560
I think it's in my roommate's car, but I'll have to check it out soon.

2524
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:28,560
Very much worth it.

2525
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:29,560
Definitely.

2526
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:30,560
All right.

2527
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:31,560
Bye, Rama.

2528
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:32,560
Bye.

2529
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:33,800
We'll take one more call.

2530
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:34,800
1-877-GAME-OLR.

2531
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:40,600
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call right now.

2532
02:28:40,600 --> 02:28:41,600
Any other last minute stories?

2533
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,600
Did we get them all?

2534
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:43,600
No, we didn't.

2535
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:44,600
All right.

2536
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:45,600
Go ahead.

2537
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:46,600
It's music news stuff.

2538
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:48,920
Pearl Jam's 10 album is coming to Rock Band in March.

2539
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:52,440
That was announced at the Spike VGA.

2540
02:28:52,440 --> 02:29:01,800
They want me smoking last night.

2541
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:03,800
Spoken.

2542
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:09,200
And then Guitar Hero Metallica, there's some stuff coming out about it, including that

2543
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:17,280
it's going to have a new, more difficult Expert Plus drum setting.

2544
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:21,200
And apparently you're also going to be able to get some new Metallica drum sounds for

2545
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:22,800
your drum fills and stuff like that.

2546
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:25,000
Hurry for my broken drum set.

2547
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,000
And?

2548
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Yeah.

2549
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Sorry, I picked up our caller.

2550
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2551
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Who's this?

2552
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
This is Akiripur.

2553
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Hey, Akiripur.

2554
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
What's on your mind?

2555
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I'm, well, what is it?

2556
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:44,080
I'm, as you haven't heard, I'm back in WoW playing on the US server once again, actually.

2557
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:45,080
Congratulations.

2558
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:47,080
Oh, well.

2559
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:58,800
Well, Andrew, I thought you were going to go up to us, that you can now change your,

2560
02:29:58,800 --> 02:30:01,440
totally re-customize your character in WoW.

2561
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:02,440
Yes.

2562
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:03,440
That's right.

2563
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:06,160
There was some new news.

2564
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:08,600
There was some new news that came out this week, is that now you can totally go back

2565
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:10,000
and re-customize your character.

2566
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:14,080
You were able to before, after the patch, you could do the hair.

2567
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:16,320
And you could change some of the facial features that way.

2568
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:21,040
But now, you can go in for a total makeover, which is where you can change everything about

2569
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:22,940
your character's looks, basically.

2570
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:25,940
But you can't change the race, you can't change the class.

2571
02:30:25,940 --> 02:30:29,000
So if you're a Tauren druid, you have to stay a Tauren druid.

2572
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,720
Or probably better, because they're the only ones that can be druids.

2573
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:36,280
But a good example would be something like, if you are a undead warlock, you can't switch

2574
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:40,120
to, you know, like a troll warlock or something, you've got to stay undead.

2575
02:30:40,120 --> 02:30:41,120
Troll warlock.

2576
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:42,760
The interesting, oh, whatever.

2577
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:48,240
The interesting thing is, is that, I don't play a warlock, obviously.

2578
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:51,760
The other interesting thing is, is that you can change the gender of your character, so

2579
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:53,840
you can now give your character a sex change!

2580
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:54,840
Whee!

2581
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:55,840
Yay.

2582
02:30:55,840 --> 02:31:01,640
And, well, here's the other thing, is that, well, as one sort of, well, I don't know if

2583
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:08,880
you're supposed to be, but as one cross-dresser sort of like, since I'm not considered myself

2584
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:10,920
fully lone fanny.

2585
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:14,520
I would say, but, that doesn't matter!

2586
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:17,480
We already play as girls already!

2587
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:23,280
Yeah, my character, I play as a Tauren female, because who plays a Tauren female?

2588
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:25,600
I'll tell you, nobody plays a Tauren female.

2589
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:26,600
You do.

2590
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:27,600
Yeah, me.

2591
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,000
And there's probably like five on the entire server.

2592
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,480
In his sassy pants?

2593
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:31,480
Yes.

2594
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:33,480
I usually don't give out the character name of the server.

2595
02:31:33,480 --> 02:31:34,480
Sorry.

2596
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:35,480
Yeah, no, that's fine.

2597
02:31:35,480 --> 02:31:36,480
Sorry.

2598
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:38,160
I don't want random tells, nah, they're probably fine.

2599
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:39,160
It's alright, I don't care.

2600
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:43,280
But yeah, I just don't need the random emails of people saying, I looked up your character

2601
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:48,840
in the armoury, and she sucks, because that'd tell them exactly what they could do.

2602
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:50,840
But anyway, sorry.

2603
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:58,760
I'm making a process of levelling up, speaking of warlocks, a warlock, and I get to level

2604
02:31:58,760 --> 02:31:59,760
30.

2605
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:06,480
It's damn, it's damn, I could say it's damn nice that you get your amount at level 30

2606
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:07,480
nowadays.

2607
02:32:07,480 --> 02:32:08,480
Oh, it's amazing.

2608
02:32:08,480 --> 02:32:10,240
They made a lot of great changes.

2609
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:13,640
One change I really like that they did is that now you have the heirlooms.

2610
02:32:13,640 --> 02:32:17,920
So if you have a level 80 character, and if you save up your badges or winter grass marks,

2611
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:21,880
you can buy these heirlooms, and you can send them, they're bind to account, meaning you

2612
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:26,760
can send these items to any player on your account, and they actually scale in level.

2613
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:30,840
And what's cool is that the shoulders heirlooms that you can buy scale in level, so you can

2614
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:35,520
send them to your level one character, and they get a 10% experience bonus gain in addition

2615
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:37,300
to the pretty awesome stats.

2616
02:32:37,300 --> 02:32:42,760
So kind of neat.

2617
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:43,760
That seems quite nice.

2618
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:44,760
Oh well.

2619
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:50,880
Well, other than that, well, I have nothing to remark about, apart from like, yeah, I

2620
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:53,760
should say, point out, check out Left 4 Dead.

2621
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:57,280
It's really nice.

2622
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:58,280
Where's this?

2623
02:32:58,280 --> 02:32:59,280
What is this?

2624
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:00,280
Left 4 Dead.

2625
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:04,400
Oh, Left 4 Dead, oh, yeah, yeah.

2626
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:10,040
When the demo was released, I got up to plate, so.

2627
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:13,080
But it really is something.

2628
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:21,240
The only thing you have to point out is that you really do need four people and mics, and

2629
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:27,200
all of them need to have mics, else there really isn't any fun.

2630
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:34,160
All right, well, I gotta let you go, because the chat wants less Warcraft and more Tatsunoko

2631
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:36,880
versus Capcom, so we're gonna wrap up the show.

2632
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:39,120
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that, too, so.

2633
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:41,080
All right, well, take care, buddy.

2634
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:42,080
Yeah, same.

2635
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:43,080
Thank you for the call.

2636
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:45,680
We enjoy hearing from our listeners from afar.

2637
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:48,880
I do have commentary about Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

2638
02:33:48,880 --> 02:33:49,880
Which would be?

2639
02:33:49,880 --> 02:33:56,200
I like the music that they've put up for the characters, that for Ken, they give him the,

2640
02:33:56,200 --> 02:34:01,280
okay, gotcha on history, for the first 13 episodes of the series, it had a more sedate

2641
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:06,000
opening, and the da-da-da theme that everyone knows was the closing theme, and then they

2642
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,000
switched it over because all the fans liked the big one better.

2643
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:14,280
So Ken gets that theme, but Jun gets the original opening, which I thought was pretty funny.

2644
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:21,400
And that's it for me being a total Tatsunoko fangirl nerd.

2645
02:34:21,400 --> 02:34:26,200
And Dan laughed at me because I was singing along with it while I was playing the other

2646
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:28,640
day.

2647
02:34:28,640 --> 02:34:34,920
All right, we're going to go around and give everybody's final thought and wrap up tonight's

2648
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:35,920
show.

2649
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:36,920
We're at the end of the show.

2650
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:37,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

2651
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:38,920
I didn't get it.

2652
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:39,920
More last minute stories.

2653
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:40,920
Sorry, yes, last minute stories.

2654
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:41,920
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2655
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:42,920
No, that's all right.

2656
02:34:42,920 --> 02:34:43,920
Okay, back to Guitar Hero Metallica.

2657
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:46,200
They have a partial track list out from it now.

2658
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:49,480
On top of the Metallica songs, there's going to be some songs from other bands that worked

2659
02:34:49,480 --> 02:34:51,320
with Metallica and stuff like that.

2660
02:34:51,320 --> 02:34:58,320
Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Turn the Page, Judas Priest, Hell Bent for Leather,

2661
02:34:58,320 --> 02:35:06,040
Cyrus with Demon Cleaner, Lynyrd Skynyrd with Tuesdays Gone, Mastodon, Blood and Thunder,

2662
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:14,240
looks like the Michael Sheckler group, Armed and Ready, Samhain, Mother of Mercy, and The

2663
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:16,280
Sword, Black River.

2664
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:23,000
And there's also apparently some unannounced tracks by Slayer, Queen, and the Foo Fighters.

2665
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:26,800
I guess this is all coming from the new Game Informer.

2666
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:28,720
It's going to have some info on that.

2667
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:33,860
Also the Metallica tracks in there, Enter Sandman, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Fuel, Hit

2668
02:35:33,860 --> 02:35:41,600
the Lights, King Nothin', Master Puppets, and No Leaf Clovers, Nothing Else Matters,

2669
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:47,640
Sad but True, The Unforgiven, and Where I May Roam, so that's kind of cool.

2670
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:54,720
And let's see, some other stuff, download content coming to LittleBigPlanet, including

2671
02:35:54,720 --> 02:36:01,680
a Santa costume you can get now, it'll be available free on December 18th, and they're

2672
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:09,920
going to have it in two parts, so you can make your Santa sack boys, and I downloaded

2673
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:10,920
that by the way.

2674
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:14,960
I haven't played LittleBigPlanet in a couple days, or actually a couple weeks, just because

2675
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:18,580
I've been playing other stuff like Prince of Persia and stuff, but yeah.

2676
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:19,580
And that's it.

2677
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:20,580
Got it.

2678
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:24,080
Alright, now we're going to go around and give everybody's final thought and get on

2679
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:28,480
out of here so we can get to our post-show, and then the Tatsunoko Capcom stuff will be

2680
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:29,480
fun.

2681
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:36,400
Everybody's final thought, Dark Soccer, we'll start with you, what's your final thought?

2682
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:40,080
They're the white shadow.

2683
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:42,080
Because if you know Gachamon.

2684
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:43,080
I don't.

2685
02:36:43,080 --> 02:36:49,280
Anyway, I forgot the whole stupid speech, so whatever.

2686
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,720
More Gachamon, less wow.

2687
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:58,640
My final thought is, wow, I love my new, I have a tanuki suit hoodie that I have now

2688
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:01,680
that's awesome, I wore it out last night and I got compliments on it, but the best part

2689
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:05,260
about it, on the actual hoodie, is little cat ears.

2690
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:08,160
So you actually look like, I'll go out and get it.

2691
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:09,160
Oh, never mind.

2692
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:14,680
Yeah, I don't have it out right now, but I'll wear it out sometime when we go out to not

2693
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:18,600
go to the test location of DJ Max Technica, because you know, you're like, I gotta go

2694
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:19,600
shopping.

2695
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:22,480
Let's get some shoes.

2696
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:23,480
Let's get some shoes.

2697
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:24,480
Loki, your final thought?

2698
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:27,760
Uh, my final thought is I gotta find Cage Man's song.

2699
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:28,760
You better hurry.
