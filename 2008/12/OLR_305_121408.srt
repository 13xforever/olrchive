1
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:15,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, December 14th, 2008.

2
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Commodore 64 game returns to the Nintendo DS.

3
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:21,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo faces yet another Wii lawsuit.

4
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:23,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Could a Rez sequel be in the works?

5
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:32,795
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura Jamie Summers

6
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,912
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

7
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:13,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us in in our snow, I mean rain.

8
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, Techmaster Loki is also joining us tonight.

9
00:01:16,588 --> 00:01:16,969
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

10
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:17,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

11
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,634
[SPEAKER_07]: As he does every week here for the past 305 some odd weeks.

12
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:22,656
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where we're at tonight, episode 305.

13
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:22,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Crazy.

14
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:23,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think.

15
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:26,559
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:48,180
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't interact with the Video Game Awards.

17
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:48,741
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.

18
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:52,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they even let people... I mean, I don't really follow it, so I don't know.

19
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:56,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they actually let people vote on it, or is it picked by experts?

20
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:57,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly.

21
00:01:57,565 --> 00:01:58,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they may have, like, voting.

22
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:00,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe someone in our chat room knows.

23
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,649
[SPEAKER_05]: For at least probably one category or something like that.

24
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,790
[SPEAKER_07]: See, but here, they get to interact with us.

25
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,791
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the Video Game Awards doesn't let the audience interact with them, really.

26
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:11,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So, except the hooping and hollering.

27
00:02:11,572 --> 00:02:12,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

28
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:22,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well we're going to get started with the show tonight and we always like to start off with a little bit of how was your gaming week So DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

29
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:37,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and it was freaking fangasm-tastic And I played Raiden Fighters 2 at the Jaspers around the corner from your house and up the road I didn't know they had that, huh?

30
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:38,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

31
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:39,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

32
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:46,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played some Ragnarok, and I tried to play some Order of Ecclesia, but I was like, meh.

33
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:56,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Tetsunoko vs. Capcom, you've been very excited about this game for a while, so when you give this game a positive review, are you giving it a positive review because it's actually a good fighting game, or are you just giving it a positive review because it tickles your fan senses?

34
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:57,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Both.

35
00:02:58,517 --> 00:02:59,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

36
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:00,038
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

37
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:06,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially since I can play as the almighty combo of Ken and June, I'm very, very happy.

38
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:07,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

39
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,557
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya I think it's paid for ahead of time

40
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:44,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says some of the categories are user voted Amaze Satsuma says video game awards have no ferrets that's why I'm watching OLR or I guess you'd be listening to it because sadly our video camera is broken just to give you an update on JustinTV we're going to be off JustinTV until 2009

41
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:47,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna say, I could bring in the PlayStation Eye, I think, has drivers.

42
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:10,367
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,209
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

44
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:54,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, how was your gaming week, Loki?

45
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:56,495
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was alright.

46
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Animal Crossing and watched a lot of my wife playing Animal Crossing.

47
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:06,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, it's Animal Crossing and I don't know why I still play it, but whatever.

48
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And then...

49
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some more Mirror's Edge, and that's pretty fun.

50
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Still very hard.

51
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:17,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the demo give you a good sense of that game?

52
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:22,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I actually tried playing the demo for that a little bit this week, and it was... It sort of does.

53
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it gets a lot harder because I think a lot of it... Luckily, you can't really die.

54
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:32,205
[SPEAKER_05]: You just keep falling off the building and respawning and starting again and stuff.

55
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:37,288
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of parts in the game that I didn't know where I was supposed to go.

56
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:38,808
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57
00:05:58,018 --> 00:06:21,510
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why I actually played some Earth Defense Force is because I had gotten some Christmas bonuses and I was thinking about buying an Import 360 to play Japanese games, but then I actually looked at what Japanese games come out over there that I would be interested in, and there's like three, and I'm like, no, not worth it.

58
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,172
[SPEAKER_05]: But Earth Defense Force was one of those, and I was like, oh yeah, I forgot about Earth Defense Force.

59
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:27,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not really, but I had to play it some more.

60
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:35,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then finally I played, um, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, and yes, it is an awesome game.

61
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:46,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it actually is a game that makes me excited about fighting games again, um, because it plays, I mean, I'm not really one to talk about fighting games because I don't play enough of them, and

62
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:47,818
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

63
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:09,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

64
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's my question about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

65
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:16,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Because from my perspective, I don't know much about the Tatsunoko universe.

66
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,866
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it that makes this game so fun?

67
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:21,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm kind of surprised that you guys are giving it such glowing reviews.

68
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:24,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I kind of expected this game to just be like a...

69
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:28,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Slap the characters on it and run with it type thing.

70
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Instant cash cow.

71
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,843
[SPEAKER_07]: But you guys both are enjoying this.

72
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:33,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of surprising me.

73
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:38,349
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it's a little bit simpler to play because it doesn't have all the kick and punch buttons.

74
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's all just light, medium, heavy attack buttons.

75
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:45,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have one button to switch characters.

76
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,156
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

77
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:53,768
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems a lot easier for me to play, and then also, it just kind of feels like Marvel vs. Capcom, which I love that game.

78
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:02,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the characters, you know, I don't know who have to... I mean, I recognize some of them from the titles of their series and stuff, but, you know...

79
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:05,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who any of them are.

80
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:07,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't watched the series and that kind of thing.

81
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:08,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just know a few of them.

82
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:13,707
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think that the character choices are a bit sparse because it's like one per game.

83
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:15,948
[SPEAKER_05]: They have, you know, going there.

84
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:20,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Street Fighter wise, you know, from Street Fighter 2, you have Ryu and Cheng Li and that's it.

85
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:46,809
[SPEAKER_05]: and then for Street Fighter 3 they have like one character from that and one character from Darkstalkers so it's very very limited in that sense but I mean there are quite a few characters I think there's like 32 altogether or something like that but it just seems kind of sparse in that sense but it's just fun I don't know and just the presentation of it's really fluid it's really smooth it plays well on the Wii which is saying much um

86
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:48,996
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much why.

87
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,957
[SPEAKER_07]: A comment from ShadowCharlie in chat.

88
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,379
[SPEAKER_07]: What would make it more interesting is that it comes to the U.S.

89
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Any hopes for this game coming to the U.S.?

90
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,743
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not going to happen because of the licensing of the Tatsuno characters.

91
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:11,312
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'd like to see is if they couldn't bring it over here, then do maybe another Marvel vs. Capcom or do Capcom vs. something else and use the same engine and just do new characters.

92
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:13,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Reskin the characters?

93
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:14,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not necessarily.

94
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom vs. Mr. T?

95
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:22,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're all 3D this time, which is kind of neat, because it's Marvel vs. Capcom, but it is 3D.

96
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,081
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like Street Fighter 4 3D, where it's 3D but 2D type thing.

97
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,923
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know, maybe pick another anime character.

98
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:36,434
[SPEAKER_05]: All ADV and Pioneer are redistributors.

99
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:39,495
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that none of these companies really have American licenses.

100
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:40,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Then fine!

101
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:40,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney vs. Capcom!

102
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd really happen.

103
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft suggests Cartoon Network versus Capcom.

104
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:55,501
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

105
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:56,762
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be retarded.

106
00:09:56,822 --> 00:10:03,646
[SPEAKER_02]: That would actually, though, be the closest thing we could actually get to some sort of animated series on TV.

107
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:05,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Nickelodeon versus Capcom.

108
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:07,327
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Warner Brothers versus Capcom.

109
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:08,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, the Animaniacs would be awesome.

110
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,149
[SPEAKER_05]: How about just Capcom versus Capcom?

111
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:10,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Freakazoid.

112
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody said that in chat, just as I said that.

113
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Capcom versus Capcom.

114
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,652
[SPEAKER_05]: They already have that, actually.

115
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:17,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember what it's called now.

116
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:19,234
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, that was a game that was scrapped.

117
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,615
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they had... It was a Capcom... It was a fighting game they even ported to the Xbox.

118
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:29,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a mega mix of characters from all these different Capcom games.

119
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:30,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

120
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:31,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure how to pronounce this name.

121
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:34,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Leo Shen, I think, or Leo Xen?

122
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably Leo Shen.

123
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Leo Shen says, your mom versus Capcom.

124
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:38,762
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Sauce said.

125
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:39,342
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

126
00:10:41,203 --> 00:10:43,724
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so it sounds like you guys have been having fun with this game one way or another.

127
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:44,565
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all right.

128
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:46,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it... Yeah, studio... Yeah, I...

129
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:50,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It was alright.

130
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it's probably not going to come out over here, which is unfortunate.

131
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:54,964
[SPEAKER_05]: But they could still use the engine for something else.

132
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I think they should do.

133
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:59,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee says, Capcom versus the world.

134
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:05,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they could do another like Street Fighter versus Capcom thing, but just make a sequel to that or something.

135
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they can just use their own characters.

136
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:11,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Capcom Fighting Evolution was the one I was thinking of.

137
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:15,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Nando in chat says, Harpo Productions versus Capcom.

138
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:15,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine that?

139
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:16,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Oprah versus Capcom.

140
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:23,159
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

141
00:11:42,164 --> 00:12:04,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto 4 on PC and it's still it's weird because I tried upgrading the RAM on my PC to 4 gigs even though Windows can only see like 2 of it but I was going to do it anyways and I had a bad run with bad RAM from Fry's apparently Fry's they keep taking back my defective RAM as just a stock return and so they have like 4 that they keep swapping out

142
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:06,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's defective.

143
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:14,229
[SPEAKER_05]: So I stopped buying RAM there because it's pointless and it would have been too much of a pain in the ass to see it on my computer.

144
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:26,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So that being said, I haven't really been playing too much of Grand Theft Auto 4 since it's still kind of buggy even though they patched it a little bit to fix some stuff.

145
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:26,793
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not enough.

146
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:33,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't support SLI yet and that kind of pisses me off because I spent the money for an extra video card.

147
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:34,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the games to fucking see it.

148
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:38,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, come on, it's like a standard nowadays.

149
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:39,853
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just lazy.

150
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:41,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn lazy is what it is.

151
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:45,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, then my gaming week.

152
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:47,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of a lot of the same usual stuff.

153
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I've obviously been playing a lot of The Wrath of the Lich King.

154
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:53,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I have done a big, big thing in WoW this week.

155
00:12:53,876 --> 00:13:00,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I respect, for a long-term basis, because we're so short on healers, just on the server in general, not just our guild, but the server.

156
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:01,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm no longer a boomkin.

157
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:04,279
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

158
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:26,516
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

159
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:48,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I checked out Meteos Wars.

160
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I only checked out the demo, so I don't want to really review a full game based strictly off the demo.

161
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Graphics were a little minimalist in the stage I played.

162
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:57,752
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it's a fairly faithful translation.

163
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:04,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering how you would have the speed of the stylus in a game like Meteos Wars, but the way they did it was kind of neat.

164
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:12,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of sliding the pieces up and down, you use triangle to move a piece up a row really fast, and you use, what, X?

165
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:13,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, triangles would be a PlayStation.

166
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:13,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, X.

167
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:14,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

168
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:15,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

169
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:24,277
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

170
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:48,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what you'd really call that.

171
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

172
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:30,713
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

173
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:56,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up in a day where it was all 2D.

174
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:00,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario Bros., Super Mario World, and all this, and even the old school Prince of Persia is 2D.

175
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:03,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's taken me a long time to really get used to 3D.

176
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:05,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I even still have problems with Mario 64, okay?

177
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:14,856
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing I like about Prince of Persia is that they've done things in this game that make it really accessible to noobs, because the game really holds your hand for a long time.

178
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:42,126
[SPEAKER_07]: and what I also like about it is that even if you fall off a cliff, you don't really die you have the chick as a crutch to kind of save you and I think a lot of hardcore gamers have been really turned off by that but for me, I've kind of appreciated it and it's kind of made me want to continue to play because I don't lose massive amounts of time because I don't know how to turn the freaking camera and that's what Tigerclaw says Sky, what about the fact that you cannot die in the game?

179
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:44,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

180
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:00,691
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't know.

181
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:03,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Progress still feels a lot like challenge to me.

182
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:07,714
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to collect things and you don't have to collect everything.

183
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:14,017
[SPEAKER_07]: You get light seeds and you don't have to collect them all to progress to new areas but you get a sense of accomplishment for collecting them all.

184
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:16,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've done other little things with it.

185
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:21,267
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

186
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:44,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Achievements are really, really easy, though, too, I noticed.

187
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,858
[SPEAKER_07]: At least, or the trophies or whatever.

188
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:49,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed I unlocked a silver trophy real easy.

189
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have to do hardly anything.

190
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:52,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So, kind of interesting.

191
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that was pretty much it for new games I played this week.

192
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:01,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping I'll probably actually play Prince of Persia a lot more, try to play it through to completion.

193
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,412
[SPEAKER_07]: They thought it was a Final Fantasy game.

194
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:06,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, no, there's no, you know.

195
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask you, did you try out Home?

196
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:12,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I try what?

197
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:12,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Home.

198
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:33,350
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, home is one of those things that I think it was a really great idea, but this execution that we're seeing of it is kind of not that great.

199
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:34,291
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

200
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:42,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, God, if you think Xbox Live is bad, the minute I logged into home, I just started hearing every naughty word in the book.

201
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:45,218
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just everything you'd hear on Xbox Live.

202
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:50,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I didn't even know that you could use microphones on Sony Home, but apparently you can.

203
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:51,949
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

204
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:52,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

205
00:18:55,458 --> 00:19:03,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, yeah, you know, it's like, and again, it was also one of those things where it kind of caused, you know, the non-game playing people who come through this house to kind of look at the TV and go, what is this?

206
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:04,402
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks kind of neat.

207
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:10,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they were watching me in the bowling alley, like, and you know, all the stuff in the bowling alley is really stupid.

208
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:15,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I tried playing one of the games in there, which was basically an overdone version of Breakout, you know, like just a redone version of that.

209
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:18,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's all free, you have to remember.

210
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:23,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't expect that it's going to be anything that great, because they're going to nickel and dime you, like they're trying to do with the costumes and everything.

211
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:31,024
[SPEAKER_07]: This all being said, I do think there's potential here for something cool.

212
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:34,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there is networking potential within home.

213
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:42,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of excited for the clubhouses to come out because I would like for us to have an OLR clubhouse where we could boot idiots and things like that.

214
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we could have a lot of fun with it.

215
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:45,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my thing.

216
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:47,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, it's...

217
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just this clusterfuck of strangeness.

218
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly, it's what it is.

219
00:19:52,518 --> 00:19:53,359
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how else to explain it.

220
00:19:53,379 --> 00:20:00,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's fair for them to be advertising this as a feature of the PlayStation 3 since it is only in beta right now?

221
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:04,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they've been having it in commercials since, what, last year?

222
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:06,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that's kind of unfair.

223
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:13,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I will answer that question, but let me address this because I got a private message.

224
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:14,247
[SPEAKER_07]: What is home?

225
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:18,628
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of us that aren't as familiar with this, basically home is like a virtual world.

226
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:24,249
[SPEAKER_07]: These types of things were especially big back in the late 90s and then kind of caught a second wind with Second Life.

227
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:31,550
[SPEAKER_07]: But when the whole virtual reality thing first came out, they used to have these chat programs where you could be like a little virtual avatar and you walk around a virtual world.

228
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Second Life kind of really took that to the next level on the PCs.

229
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:40,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is kind of Sony's version of Second Life where you create a little version of yourself.

230
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:42,799
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you can think of me, I guess, but it's a lot more realistic.

231
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:51,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And you literally, using your controllers, walk around an open area where there's other people dancing or talking or interacting with each other.

232
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:58,054
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you can go into like a bowling alley and you can walk up to a bowling machine if they're not all full, which they usually are.

233
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:01,429
[SPEAKER_07]: and play bowling with other people and interact with them that way.

234
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you could walk up to an arcade machine.

235
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,371
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like, you know, it's like a virtual life.

236
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:09,353
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like a game, but it's not.

237
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:11,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that makes any sense at all.

238
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:14,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their idea to try a new networking thing.

239
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:20,019
[SPEAKER_07]: VXChaseNextV in chat says, Second life is a construct.

240
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:20,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Home is a construct.

241
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so now what was your question?

242
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:24,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Home, is it fair to advertise it?

243
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:25,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

244
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:25,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

245
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:29,731
[SPEAKER_07]: It's obvious that Sony wanted to do a lot more with this.

246
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:30,872
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not implemented yet.

247
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:33,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what's taken them so long.

248
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:39,037
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe it's just like, again, it's one of those things where the ideas are coming faster than the reality of being able to program it in.

249
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:42,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, technically, yeah, they can advertise it.

250
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I would equate it to when they advertise video games with nothing but the cutscenes from the game.

251
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:48,666
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

252
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:11,963
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

253
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:12,924
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in beta.

254
00:22:12,944 --> 00:22:15,606
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even done.

255
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:16,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't Gmail still in beta?

256
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:18,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's functional.

257
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say it's close to being functional, but it's not.

258
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:31,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be like putting out a demo of a game or something like that and then advertising that in a commercial for the PlayStation or something like that.

259
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:33,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, play Killzone 2.

260
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, except it's not out.

261
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a demo or something like that.

262
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's a little misleading.

263
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:46,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that anyone really gives a crap about their commercials, since I think the sales numbers speak for themselves, so whatever.

264
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:47,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's kind of misleading.

265
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's potential in Home, but it has yet to be unlocked.

266
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:56,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the only other thing I want to say about Home is that it's a little confusing.

267
00:22:56,515 --> 00:23:00,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the things about the Xbox, especially the Nintendo one...

268
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:09,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are very easy to just kind of pop into and go, and obviously neither system has done something as ambitious as Home, but Home's kind of complicated.

269
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:16,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it took me a minute to really kind of work through the menus and everything, and it really is, it's even more tough when not everything's available yet.

270
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,504
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other kind of bummer about it.

271
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:22,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jason wants to correct that Gmail is no longer in beta.

272
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:24,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Gmail is official.

273
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:25,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Gmail Labs is beta add-ons.

274
00:23:26,107 --> 00:23:26,527
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

275
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting comments from chat.

276
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:33,825
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, it's like calling Windows 3.1.1 a game.

277
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:35,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

278
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Home isn't really a game.

279
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:40,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like folding at home is not really a game either.

280
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:41,388
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a simulation.

281
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a thing.

282
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,011
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I guess you could say it's a simulation.

283
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:48,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

284
00:23:49,952 --> 00:23:55,393
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping real quick, of which we don't have a whole lot of tonight.

285
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:59,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, always check us out on MySpace at Orange Launch Radio or Facebook at the OL Army.

286
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:01,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Our Twitter is OLR.

287
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:06,977
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also on LiveJournal, Community Orange Lounge, and we always try to keep you up to date on the latest and greatest.

288
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:13,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, it's been kind of a busy past few months, so a lot of our internet presence has really slowed down, so sorry about that.

289
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:18,960
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're still trying to keep it going with the show and do what we always do, and hopefully 2009 will be a little better.

290
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll be warmer.

291
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:30,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, also, one thing you gotta see in home is that when you go into the theater, you just get to see an extended Twilight trailer playing on the screen over and over and over again.

292
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:36,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen it, nor probably will I. It's very Mystery Science 3000-able.

293
00:24:38,065 --> 00:24:39,065
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be funny.

294
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,106
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the type of stuff they should be using home for.

295
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:44,127
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's why I say there's potential there.

296
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:46,748
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't necessarily mean Sony's gonna ever unlock it.

297
00:24:46,908 --> 00:24:47,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying.

298
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:48,208
[SPEAKER_07]: There's potential.

299
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:50,075
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

300
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:50,476
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

301
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:53,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some gaming news, Loki.

302
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Start us off.

303
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:54,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

304
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:05,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Sony, Sony has been seeing some hard times, and they're actually cutting plants and with that slashing 8,000 jobs.

305
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:18,619
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all supposed to happen between now and April of 2010, and Sony will cut about 5% of their electronics divisions and close a tenth of its manufacturing sites.

306
00:25:20,316 --> 00:25:22,197
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not good, especially in this tough economy.

307
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:26,239
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of sad.

308
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it just because PS3s haven't been selling well?

309
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:34,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it that now they don't need these people because the PS3 is already out?

310
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:36,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just because they haven't been selling well.

311
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:41,888
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no need to have these extra plants producing more systems if they're not selling out.

312
00:25:41,948 --> 00:25:44,010
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not having an issue with selling out at all.

313
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:46,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Although,

314
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:52,186
[SPEAKER_05]: They are at times hard to find just because they keep phasing out SKUs left and right.

315
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:54,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, crap.

316
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:59,092
[SPEAKER_05]: This year alone there's been four different SKUs for the PS3.

317
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:01,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's kind of crazy right there.

318
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:06,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's four new SKUs and that's not even including the ones that we came in this year with.

319
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

320
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:13,869
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of related, but it kind of goes back to what we were talking about with Home.

321
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:15,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to read this comment because it's interesting.

322
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee says in chat,

323
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:28,394
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of strange.

324
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:28,815
[SPEAKER_07]: It's neat.

325
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:31,896
[SPEAKER_07]: But see, that's kind of cool with the whole BD Live thing.

326
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:32,216
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean...

327
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:45,483
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

328
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:05,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, what an interesting movie.

329
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,493
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really the only word I can use to describe it as interesting.

330
00:27:09,513 --> 00:27:11,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Certain people are kind of dicks.

331
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,935
[SPEAKER_07]: The drama is still playing out.

332
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:14,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, though.

333
00:27:16,757 --> 00:27:18,819
[SPEAKER_07]: God, how far do I want to get into this on the show?

334
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:22,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when we were just talking about something completely different, and I apologize.

335
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:27,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's very sad that people lost their jobs, but unfortunately we don't know much more than that at this time about it.

336
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,025
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we are on this whole other subject.

337
00:27:29,686 --> 00:27:29,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

338
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:37,338
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta kind of wonder, like with this movie, how biased is it trying to be?

339
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:45,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not trying to say that Billy Mitchell is not likely the pompous ass he made himself to be in the movie, but I don't know.

340
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:46,463
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something about it.

341
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:52,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Something about the fact that they had all these cameras in just the right places at just the right times when all these things were going on.

342
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:57,268
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something about it that says there's some type of...

343
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:01,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Editing stuff going on here.

344
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:02,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

345
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:16,214
[SPEAKER_07]: But then at the same time, I know a lot of our folks listen to the other shows on All Games and you've probably heard all this crap about the Twin Galaxies and Mr. Awesome's been on All Games off and on throughout the years and all this crap going on with Twin Galaxies.

346
00:28:16,914 --> 00:28:22,258
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kind of goes to show you this drama has been going on for years and is continuing even still today.

347
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:26,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just with Donkey Kong, but with the official scores in general.

348
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:27,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just kind of...

349
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:29,285
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

350
00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:56,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, he's like, well, not the Steve Wiebe guy that seems, you know, pretty cool or whatever, and his family's pretty funny, but most of the people in the movie are very sad individuals, like Billy and his lackeys and, you know, all that stuff.

351
00:28:56,355 --> 00:29:06,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of like, well... But Billy Mitchell actually owns his own business and, you know, makes his... I'm saying he's still an ass, but, you know, but he's a successful businessman.

352
00:29:07,335 --> 00:29:09,057
[SPEAKER_07]: The King of Kong was a very good movie.

353
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,731
[SPEAKER_07]: He sent the tape in and all this stuff.

354
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,892
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a camera at his house when he sends in the tape.

355
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:29,932
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a camera there.

356
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:31,732
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a camera with Grandma at the airport.

357
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:34,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of like, this seems all way too pre-planned for me.

358
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:37,014
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the only problem I had with the movie.

359
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:40,195
[SPEAKER_07]: This documentary was really well done.

360
00:29:43,136 --> 00:29:45,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, almost too well done.

361
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:45,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

362
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:46,397
[SPEAKER_07]: It was weird.

363
00:29:46,977 --> 00:29:48,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I also didn't see him as being...

364
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:57,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, uh, excuse me, being rather pompous enough to want to tape everything.

365
00:29:58,258 --> 00:30:02,461
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing, here's what I was going to say, and this is what I was kind of going to tell my roommate about too.

366
00:30:02,942 --> 00:30:05,824
[SPEAKER_07]: You see these kind of pompous asses in lots of sports.

367
00:30:06,324 --> 00:30:11,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you ever watch some of these football press conferences or wrestling or boxing?

368
00:30:11,648 --> 00:30:16,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, some of us cheer on these pompous assholes in wrestling, you know what I mean?

369
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:16,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

370
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:21,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in a way, I don't hate the guy.

371
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,109
[SPEAKER_07]: He did come off like a pompous ass in the movie, but maybe there's more to him than that.

372
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

373
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Just interesting.

374
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:29,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

375
00:30:33,277 --> 00:31:01,922
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you look at some of these side stories going on like the whole Mr. Awesome Missile Command I never realized and keep in mind I've been watching this whole thing play out on all games I never realized that he had the direct impact on that movie by sending the guy the Donkey Kong board that he did and just to kind of see like literally I was just kind of like wow a lot of this makes sense now what I've been hearing on all games like damn these people and their drama overscores but I don't know

376
00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:03,819
[SPEAKER_07]: All they've got.

377
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:05,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

378
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:07,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't fault them for it.

379
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:08,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're sad people.

380
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:10,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what they're into.

381
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:13,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just... I don't know.

382
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:14,734
[SPEAKER_07]: It hurts my head to think about it.

383
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:18,968
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost makes you wonder, it's like, okay, so say you have it.

384
00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:21,409
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know who I blame even more to?

385
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:24,810
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the fucking Guinness Book of World Records, because they're not helping things.

386
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:28,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Now putting out this stupid gaming book and stuff, they're just egging it on.

387
00:31:29,132 --> 00:31:37,936
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only that, but they have stupid records in there, like people that claim to have the highest score in DDR, a game that I don't think you can have a high score in.

388
00:31:38,817 --> 00:31:39,077
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

389
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:41,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, so subjective

390
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:08,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

391
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:09,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

392
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:48,325
[SPEAKER_07]: and you know I understand you know I understand why people get all into it because like you know I think one guy who was like a friend of Steve Levy or something said it said it best in the movie this guy my friend Steve is the best in the world at something in the entire world and true it might be Donkey Kong but he's the best in the world

393
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:51,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see why people get so passionate over that.

394
00:32:51,826 --> 00:32:53,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see him play through the kill screen?

395
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:53,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

396
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:55,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty sweet.

397
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:57,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a kill screen once.

398
00:32:58,629 --> 00:32:58,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Once.

399
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was little.

400
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:05,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

401
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:05,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

402
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:09,034
[SPEAKER_07]: A total tangent that took up more time than the... It's a cool tangent.

403
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:10,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gaming and not food.

404
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Much sadder story.

405
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:13,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of food though, I ate at Olive Garden today.

406
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:15,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Home of the NeverEnding Breadsticks.

407
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry I didn't invite you, Jamie.

408
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:20,093
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a last minute thing.

409
00:33:20,353 --> 00:33:22,235
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the first time I've had it since the surgery.

410
00:33:22,255 --> 00:33:23,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

411
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:27,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad tangent, especially following a story about such horrible layoffs as Sony.

412
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, we don't have a lot more to tell you there.

413
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:36,724
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's talk about sales, and maybe this might help explain kind of the Sony layoffs and so on.

414
00:33:37,004 --> 00:33:40,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the November numbers from MPD are in, talking about the sales.

415
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:46,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Wii in November sold 2.04 million units, probably no one's surprised.

416
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:48,629
[SPEAKER_07]: The DS in second place, 1.57 million units.

417
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:48,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360, 836K.

418
00:33:54,997 --> 00:34:23,924
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP 421k PS3 378k Playstation 2 is finally in last place 206k so this might finally be the PS2 kind of walking out the door here but it's kind of strange that the PS3 you know is the PS2 is definitely on it's way out it's not I'd say maybe by the end of next year because I mean looking just at what the releases are like for example in February

419
00:34:24,824 --> 00:34:27,989
[SPEAKER_05]: There are three games coming out for the PS2, and that is it.

420
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:32,697
[SPEAKER_05]: In January, I think two or three also coming out.

421
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:35,581
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting a lot less...

422
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:39,874
[SPEAKER_05]: FloatwalkinChat says people buy PSP still?

423
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:08,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because it isn't just a game system, but it's the whole movies and internet and MP3s in your pocket.

424
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:11,228
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are released.

425
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:15,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly enough, a lot of the publishers are just not making PSP games anymore.

426
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:20,331
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of games coming out is really sad, and it's not a good sign.

427
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:21,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you think everyone jumped ship suddenly?

428
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:23,332
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

429
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine Zahar the program for it, but they don't sell very well.

430
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:50,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Their versions aren't very good.

431
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:52,893
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have the install base for it.

432
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,734
[SPEAKER_05]: People are playing DSs more.

433
00:35:57,175 --> 00:36:00,576
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of good PSP games, it's just... I don't know.

434
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:02,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

435
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:33,376
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I wonder if the Final Fantasy VII remake that people always have big boners talking about on the PlayStation 3, like, you know, big fangasm, you know, talking about they want it to happen on PlayStation 3, I wonder if they wouldn't do something like that for PSP.

436
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:36,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't think it'd be very good.

437
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,203
[SPEAKER_05]: They could bring the, like, Final Fantasy VII, maybe redo some of the graphics a little bit, and...

438
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:43,659
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

439
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,862
[SPEAKER_07]: which, you know, kind of contradicts that story we had a couple weeks ago that wasn't selling very well because it was the 10th best-selling game in November.

440
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:22,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it didn't hit the millions and millions expectations, but the 10th best-selling game out of everything that's out there, that's not that bad.

441
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:23,744
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

442
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:30,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and then also I think the last report we saw for the MPD numbers, it was only out for like a week, so...

443
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:32,594
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

444
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

445
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I can probably have explanations for most of these.

446
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:59,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Number 9 was Resistance 2 on the PlayStation 3, which is PS3's one of their big titles.

447
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:02,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Number 8 was Left 4 Dead on the Xbox 360.

448
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:03,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I really need to pick that game up.

449
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:06,635
[SPEAKER_07]: That game's been performing above expectations, right?

450
00:38:07,556 --> 00:38:07,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

451
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:10,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Number 7 was Guitar Hero World Tour on the Wii.

452
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty World of War on the PS3 Mario Kart on the Wii

453
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:36,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four, Wii Fit.

454
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:39,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Also another thing that's very short and hard to find.

455
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:42,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three, Wii Play with the remote.

456
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:45,606
[SPEAKER_05]: If people just sell that like a remote, hey, you get a $10 game.

457
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Then that's got to be why this game is still topping the charts.

458
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:51,372
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

459
00:39:07,189 --> 00:39:07,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be it.

460
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, Call of Duty World of War, the 360 version.

461
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And then number one would be Gears of War 2 on the Xbox 360.

462
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:21,857
[SPEAKER_07]: But I should point out, if you add up the two Call of Duty World of Wars across 360 and PS3, that would be number one, not Gears of War 2.

463
00:39:22,637 --> 00:39:27,360
[SPEAKER_07]: But Gears of War 2 being Xbox 360 exclusive only has the one system to consider.

464
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,542
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just an interesting list.

465
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:33,143
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

466
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:34,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Your November NPD numbers.

467
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:42,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for people like me who have an iPhone, there is some fun out there, although I've been hearing mixed reviews on it.

468
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:48,633
[SPEAKER_02]: There is I Love Katamari, which is actually I Love Katamari on the iPhone.

469
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:54,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's $7.99, and you can either play it on the iPhone or the iPod Touch.

470
00:39:55,154 --> 00:40:00,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's 82 meg, has a story, time attack, eternal and exact size.

471
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:09,610
[SPEAKER_02]: and it apparently suffers really bad from the iPhone's poor frame rate for games but I figured I might download it eventually.

472
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:13,411
[SPEAKER_02]: The last game I actually paid for was Pole Position.

473
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:19,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to check it out, but then I read the reviews, and they all were bitching about the frame rate, and I was like, okay, maybe this isn't so cool.

474
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:21,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that's just iPhone games anyway.

475
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,705
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at any review on an iPhone game, they're going to talk about the frame rate unless it's something, you know, dinky like Pac-Man.

476
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Labyrinth, which is what I play all the time.

477
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:31,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter, though.

478
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:32,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't think...

479
00:40:33,837 --> 00:40:35,978
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like bitching about the framerate on any system.

480
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see that that's a reason to even put out a game.

481
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, oh, I can't get the framerate up where I need to be.

482
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you can't release the game.

483
00:40:44,182 --> 00:40:46,463
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you can't get it up.

484
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,964
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to make some sort of missions for...

485
00:40:52,932 --> 00:41:05,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know whether it be like you just use cell shading, really flat textures so that the size of the textures isn't really big and so it's able to render it faster, or I don't know.

486
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:15,480
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to push the iPhone as this big gaming platform, and yeah, unfortunately to me that's almost like pushing the N-Gage as a big gaming platform.

487
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,041
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

488
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:23,404
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, games look a bajillion times better on the iPhone than they did on the N-Gage.

489
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:25,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a great gaming taco.

490
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:26,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand this.

491
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:38,653
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, there's so much more functionality with the iPhone that comparing it to that waste of electronics that was the N-Gage is seriously like comparing...

492
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:50,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to say a Blackberry with one of those old car phones that you had to attach to your cigarette lighter and was the size of your head.

493
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:51,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my thing.

494
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:56,850
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to be a gaming platform.

495
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,890
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they keep saying.

496
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They're one of the best gaming platforms out there.

497
00:42:01,091 --> 00:42:04,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how they can claim that, but they are.

498
00:42:07,772 --> 00:42:20,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny, if Nintendo had almost taken the same idea and just done almost like what XNA is doing and opened that up to people to release apps for the DS, can you imagine how much money they'd make?

499
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:22,002
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just ridiculous.

500
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,004
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the same thing there.

501
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:33,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even really call them a gaming platform anyways because for me, a game console is something that you can actually buy games for, not necessarily just digital downloads.

502
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's the future of stuff, but

503
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not seeing it.

504
00:42:37,585 --> 00:42:40,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's more casual.

505
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:42,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

506
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:45,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's ever going to take the place of a handheld game system.

507
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:49,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to read this comment real quick from AlphaCananagram in chat.

508
00:42:49,655 --> 00:42:51,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Katamari in its current build.

509
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the worst eight bucks I've spent.

510
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:54,599
[SPEAKER_07]: It's neat but slow.

511
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there you go.

512
00:42:58,342 --> 00:42:59,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Listener review of the game.

513
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on.

514
00:43:04,904 --> 00:43:07,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so some other cool stuff.

515
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:09,726
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about this a little bit.

516
00:43:10,267 --> 00:43:13,268
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Home has finally made its way out, or at least the beta of it.

517
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:16,950
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a 77 meg download.

518
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,093
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you do need to have, I believe, three gigs dedicated to...

519
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:24,610
[SPEAKER_05]: to this.

520
00:43:24,991 --> 00:43:34,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, when you start it up, it says that you have to dedicate three gigs of your drive to the game, and it says okay, and then you basically, it partitions off a part of the drive for it.

521
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:35,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it's doing.

522
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It reserves part of the drive.

523
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:39,442
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because you're downloading new areas as you go.

524
00:43:39,943 --> 00:43:41,404
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go in there and download new stuff.

525
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:43,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what it's all used for.

526
00:43:43,426 --> 00:43:45,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's caching data or something.

527
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:49,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's storage of the actual areas and stuff like that, probably the videos.

528
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:49,951
[SPEAKER_07]: The areas aren't that

529
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:50,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

530
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it was so that you don't download stuff you don't need, but I just figured the three gigs was some type of cache information.

531
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:32,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably so that their servers don't crash from everybody downloading it all at once, and that way it saves them a little bit of time, and that way every time it goes in there, it checks to see if there's any updates to it.

532
00:44:32,483 --> 00:44:34,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like, remember how AOL was?

533
00:44:34,244 --> 00:44:36,624
[SPEAKER_05]: How you'd go to different pages and you'd download updates?

534
00:44:36,704 --> 00:44:38,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like that.

535
00:44:38,525 --> 00:44:40,685
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is available right now.

536
00:44:41,085 --> 00:44:41,925
[SPEAKER_05]: You can check it out.

537
00:44:42,365 --> 00:44:44,666
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there are issues, and obviously...

538
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:53,849
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been having trouble with it staying online and they've had to actually shut down the PlayStation Network for about an hour to fix stuff.

539
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:58,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it's definitely acting like it was in beta.

540
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:05,392
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's available to check out and it's been a long time coming.

541
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:09,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't they having a lot of issues on launch day with the downloads?

542
00:45:10,094 --> 00:45:11,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard, yeah.

543
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:17,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I got in there very easily, but I didn't remember it was out until like late in the evening.

544
00:45:17,142 --> 00:45:19,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'd been watching a movie and I was like, oh yeah, I want to download Home.

545
00:45:20,124 --> 00:45:21,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not going to try it for a while.

546
00:45:21,445 --> 00:45:25,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I just haven't gotten, I'm not really gung-ho to jump into it.

547
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:27,190
[SPEAKER_05]: It just kind of, eh.

548
00:45:27,651 --> 00:45:32,895
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like the avatars for me, you know, just like on the new Xbox experience or whatever.

549
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:37,680
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of neat, made my avatar, that's it, you know, whatever.

550
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

551
00:45:39,788 --> 00:45:43,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Question from chatroom, Tigerclaw asks, Interesting, does it let you walk around the world?

552
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:45,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it download in the backgrounds and stuff?

553
00:45:45,712 --> 00:45:52,337
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of annoying when you're walking in an environment that appears empty and then about a minute later everything suddenly appears and you appear to have run into a wall.

554
00:45:52,657 --> 00:45:54,878
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it doesn't do that with the environments.

555
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,200
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you have to download everything before you go in.

556
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,202
[SPEAKER_07]: So it doesn't actually download the environment as you go.

557
00:46:00,582 --> 00:46:06,006
[SPEAKER_07]: What will download as you go, like the movie that's playing in the movie theater, like the Twilight trailer or whatever...

558
00:46:06,206 --> 00:46:06,767
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

559
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:25,828
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I don't know, there's really not a lot of point to it.

560
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:32,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, see, but remember when Home was going to let me show whatever movie I wanted to on my screen in my home?

561
00:46:33,034 --> 00:46:33,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, remember that?

562
00:46:33,955 --> 00:46:34,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

563
00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:35,536
[SPEAKER_07]: We were supposed to have that?

564
00:46:35,616 --> 00:46:36,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, that would have been cool.

565
00:46:36,817 --> 00:46:40,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think they got rid of that because of, you know, licensing.

566
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, because you'd think people would put up, you know, porn and what have you, but... No, I think they weren't even caring about porn.

567
00:46:46,105 --> 00:46:49,008
[SPEAKER_05]: They were caring about people putting up, like, say... Okay, so copyrighted porn.

568
00:46:49,028 --> 00:46:49,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

569
00:46:49,528 --> 00:47:00,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but imagine if we could have had an OLR clubhouse and we could have shot, like, some video just for fun, you know, that could loop in the clubhouse or something that we could have had in there just for fun and, like, change it out once a week or something.

570
00:47:01,097 --> 00:47:07,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that would be great, and that's potential, but I just know that's not going to happen for years.

571
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:12,525
[SPEAKER_05]: No, is that something, like, kind of like, um... What is it, uh...

572
00:47:15,037 --> 00:47:21,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have to be logged into your account or something like that for someone to be able to jump into your clubhouse?

573
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:24,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know because clubs aren't available yet.

574
00:47:24,723 --> 00:47:26,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're going to have to pay for them when they do come out.

575
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:30,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if it's just a small fee, I don't mind paying it just to kind of screw around with it.

576
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:35,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think there's potential to kind of have the community there.

577
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're all about community here at OLR.

578
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,232
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to know a little more about what...

579
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:42,732
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually do with it.

580
00:47:43,773 --> 00:47:45,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it seems like it's going to be a little limiting.

581
00:47:45,513 --> 00:47:47,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if I would have to be on or not.

582
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:49,635
[SPEAKER_07]: But the PS3 is also one of those systems you can kind of just leave on.

583
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,416
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make any noise or nothing.

584
00:47:51,556 --> 00:47:59,239
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could hook up a PS3 in here and then broadcast our show into that clubhouse and have us on the TV.

585
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:00,459
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was thinking!

586
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that be an awesome potential?

587
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,160
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be awesome.

588
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:13,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if we could actually, because if you can talk through your headset, then that thing supports streaming audio, and I'm sure there would be a way that during the duration of the show we could just shut everyone else up.

589
00:48:13,505 --> 00:48:15,106
[SPEAKER_07]: We shouldn't be giving away all our ideas.

590
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:16,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Other podcasts are going to steal them.

591
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:16,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, whatever.

592
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:18,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't be the first time.

593
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,370
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, that's kind of like the idea I would want to do.

594
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's potential there, but I don't know.

595
00:48:29,582 --> 00:48:31,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason says, you can create a club in home and it'll cost $5.

596
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:33,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you actually do that now?

597
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,344
[SPEAKER_07]: When I tried to look at it, you couldn't do it.

598
00:48:36,225 --> 00:48:38,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they actually open that up and I just couldn't figure it out?

599
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:43,727
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says, this is why Second Life does it better.

600
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:49,589
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually create a club, invite people to come over, and the club will actually play music in the background by streaming a shoutcast stream into it.

601
00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:54,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should have put a thing in Second Life a long time ago, but it was kind of expensive, wasn't it?

602
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

603
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:55,611
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Second Life.

604
00:48:55,651 --> 00:48:56,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to touch that.

605
00:48:56,372 --> 00:48:56,992
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like dirty.

606
00:48:58,075 --> 00:48:59,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Home's not much better then.

607
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:05,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not much better, but it's like the new gas station bathroom.

608
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a brand new gas station.

609
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:09,042
[SPEAKER_05]: The bathroom hasn't quite gotten all disease ridden yet.

610
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:09,823
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

611
00:49:10,123 --> 00:49:11,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on.

612
00:49:11,124 --> 00:49:12,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about other PlayStation 3.

613
00:49:12,505 --> 00:49:22,491
[SPEAKER_07]: What could have been, and according to 1Up, apparently what happened, Final Fantasy XI, you know, kind of interesting that it came out on the Xbox 360, but it never really came out on the PlayStation 3.

614
00:49:22,812 --> 00:49:26,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, true, you could do the PS2 backwards compatibility, but even then...

615
00:49:26,514 --> 00:49:31,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes the hard drive issues will kind of get in the way, I think, depending on what system you owned, I think.

616
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:37,363
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you can download a patch that would allow you to play it from the PS2 version on the PS3.

617
00:49:37,423 --> 00:49:37,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's cool.

618
00:49:38,003 --> 00:49:46,971
[SPEAKER_07]: But at some point they were going to release, I guess, a nicer version, I guess you could say, on the PlayStation 3, probably one with all the expansions included and what have you.

619
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:54,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently it was supposed to happen, but apparently the Sony representative that Square was working with

620
00:49:55,857 --> 00:50:00,418
[SPEAKER_07]: They were working with Hiromichi Tanaka, I guess, just quit.

621
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:05,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And they never really resumed talks, which is kind of strange.

622
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:11,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well, Final Fantasy XI is still getting three new expansions next year, but not through the traditional retail channels.

623
00:50:11,181 --> 00:50:14,002
[SPEAKER_07]: They will all be downloadable story expansions.

624
00:50:14,082 --> 00:50:19,623
[SPEAKER_07]: No new classes, none of that stuff, just story and quest expansions, which is interesting.

625
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:21,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I assume zone expansions too.

626
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,880
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yep, Final Fantasy XI on the PS3.

627
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,620
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an idea.

628
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:30,184
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you wondered why it wasn't there, somebody else must have been thinking the same thing, but then they just gave up.

629
00:50:31,024 --> 00:50:32,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they didn't care like some of us.

630
00:50:33,226 --> 00:50:33,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

631
00:50:33,786 --> 00:50:35,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of over Final Fantasy XI.

632
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:37,549
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in another addiction now.

633
00:50:37,949 --> 00:50:38,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have WoW now.

634
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:44,754
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would like to revisit Final Fantasy XI someday when it gets redone and has a new, like Final Fantasy XI 2.

635
00:50:46,155 --> 00:50:46,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

636
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,176
[SPEAKER_07]: They did X-2.

637
00:50:47,216 --> 00:50:47,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't they do X-11 2?

638
00:50:49,168 --> 00:50:51,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have good taste sometimes.

639
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:51,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shush.

640
00:50:53,691 --> 00:50:56,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's something that should excite a lot of people.

641
00:50:57,594 --> 00:51:00,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of our listeners out there who are fans of Fallout 3.

642
00:51:01,236 --> 00:51:11,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for the PC, Bethesda actually brought out a PC tool set for Fallout 3 so that you can...

643
00:51:12,643 --> 00:51:16,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess create your own levels.

644
00:51:16,627 --> 00:51:20,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You can modify and edit buildings, landscapes, dialogue characters.

645
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:24,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you can just change it all up into your own game pretty much.

646
00:51:25,675 --> 00:51:26,096
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

647
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's not all over this.

648
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called the Garden of Eden Creation Kit.

649
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:34,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really mod games anymore.

650
00:51:35,164 --> 00:51:38,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I wait for other people to mod them and then add to it.

651
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:41,744
[SPEAKER_02]: You can download it off of the Fallout 3 website.

652
00:51:41,824 --> 00:51:43,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 8.47 megabytes.

653
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:54,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I want someone to do the wondrous thing that someone has done with the Half-Life editor and make me a Hypercube version of Fallout 3.

654
00:51:55,728 --> 00:51:59,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see one where the world ended because of something Jamie did.

655
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a Maniac Mansion!

656
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:04,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, you totally could.

657
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:05,587
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be pretty awesome.

658
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:15,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, I was going to say, other than all the cool stuff for Half-Life, Grand Theft Auto 4, they have some of the first mods out there for it.

659
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:23,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the game actually doesn't allow you to run files that are modified, but someone's found a way around it, like it was cake or something.

660
00:52:25,396 --> 00:52:28,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've made pistols that fire rockets, which are pretty funny.

661
00:52:29,258 --> 00:52:32,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also pistols and machine guns that have...

662
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

663
00:52:55,231 --> 00:52:56,332
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

664
00:53:18,523 --> 00:53:23,708
[SPEAKER_05]: is some brand new download content, and that'll be coming soon.

665
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:39,543
[SPEAKER_05]: What's kind of neat about the download content, though, is they're going to be raising the level cap on it, and you'll actually be able to... I don't know what level they're going to raise it to, but I know right now it's pretty limited.

666
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:42,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's like 30 or something.

667
00:53:43,973 --> 00:53:45,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Fightin' Alaska Fightin' Alaska Fightin' Alaska

668
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:10,236
[SPEAKER_05]: 4-5 hours long, 800 Microsoft Points

669
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:43,118
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, shifting gears here a little bit, talking about a different type of quest.

670
00:54:43,258 --> 00:54:47,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I promised there'd be a story on WoW tonight, and it's not really the type of story you might be expecting.

671
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,621
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually something game politics ran, so you know it's going to involve controversy.

672
00:54:51,181 --> 00:54:51,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Something political.

673
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:55,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to do with World of Warcraft, and they are actually re-re-re-

674
00:54:56,883 --> 00:54:58,544
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

675
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:19,150
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

676
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:42,127
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a quest where you basically torture a prisoner to get information out of him to move on.

677
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:44,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is what Richard Bartell said about it.

678
00:55:44,648 --> 00:55:47,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you have to take some type of cowpoke and zap a prisoner until he talks.

679
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:48,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not at all happy with this.

680
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:55,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I was expecting for there to be some way to tell the guy who gave you the quest that no, actually, I don't want to torture a prisoner, but there didn't seem to be any way to do that.

681
00:55:55,696 --> 00:56:02,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Worse, the quest is part of a chain you need to complete to gain access to the Nexus, which is the first instance you encounter if you start at the west of the continent as I did.

682
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:06,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So either you play along and zap the guy or you don't get to go to the Nexus.

683
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:07,758
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game!

684
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:38,573
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm kind of, I'm just kind of a little bit in disbelief because it's like, well, A, he's completely misstating the thing about you have to do this quest to enter the Nexus.

685
00:56:38,593 --> 00:56:39,233
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not true.

686
00:56:40,174 --> 00:56:43,155
[SPEAKER_07]: You can enter the Nexus whenever, you know, you can get summoned there.

687
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:46,077
[SPEAKER_07]: You just don't get the quest line or what have you.

688
00:56:46,097 --> 00:56:51,719
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't, I mean, there's like 50,000 quests now and I'm obviously overstating that.

689
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:53,640
[SPEAKER_07]: There's lots and lots of quests in Wrath of the Lich King.

690
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:58,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me, you can level your character to 80 and only play through like 4 of the zones.

691
00:56:59,423 --> 00:57:00,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's like 7 or 8 zones.

692
00:57:00,723 --> 00:57:02,004
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could skip this all together.

693
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,444
[SPEAKER_07]: You could start on the East Continent or whatever.

694
00:57:03,484 --> 00:57:04,185
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, okay.

695
00:57:04,765 --> 00:57:12,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you couldn't skip this and it was a part of the game, I mean, do you write angry letters every time you watch an episode of 24 and he tortures a prisoner?

696
00:57:13,149 --> 00:57:14,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Or every time you watch a movie?

697
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:20,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Or every time somebody wrote a torture scene in a mud game somewhere on the internet, which I'm sure exists somewhere?

698
00:57:21,293 --> 00:57:21,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, hello?

699
00:57:24,063 --> 00:57:26,446
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it we always say here that you started here, Jay?

700
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:27,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Learn to be offended!

701
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:28,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

702
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking people.

703
00:57:31,713 --> 00:57:35,117
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just a game.

704
00:57:35,197 --> 00:57:41,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if you want to, you just go to the quest and you click Abandoned Quest and there, you don't have to do it.

705
00:57:42,066 --> 00:57:42,687
[SPEAKER_07]: How hard was that?

706
00:57:45,524 --> 00:57:53,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, the kind of ignorance stated here, even if this guy is a big deal for what he did, it was kind of a silly thing to state here.

707
00:57:53,691 --> 00:57:58,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I'm just going to do the angsty FUs part of the show right now.

708
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if this is political.

709
00:58:16,008 --> 00:58:19,952
[SPEAKER_02]: A big blaming fuck you to George Bush.

710
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:30,502
[SPEAKER_02]: For all of the series of legislation he's just passed during his last blessed day, you know, the end of his, you know,

711
00:58:31,543 --> 00:58:32,204
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

712
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:15,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Also for passing a law that pretty much lets any doctor not perform any kind of procedure based on moral, personal ethics, not necessarily the overall ethics of the community that they represent.

713
00:59:16,372 --> 00:59:33,347
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's really disgusting a lot of it is from as far as I could tell unconstitutional and I'm sure quite a bit of it can be overturned under congressional review which is the one good thing that Newt Gingrich ever did apart from being hilarious on TV

714
00:59:34,068 --> 00:59:36,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

715
00:59:49,975 --> 00:59:51,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say F you to

716
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:22,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Take 2 for putting out a crappy version.

717
01:00:22,692 --> 01:00:27,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I should say a buggy version of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC.

718
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:37,325
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that I've got to still wait for patches before they support something that most modern games support now is ridiculous.

719
01:00:39,676 --> 01:00:43,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I just hate having to wait before a game to work correctly.

720
01:00:45,459 --> 01:00:52,623
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm spending the money to buy the game, why does it have to be weeks later that I get a game that actually works?

721
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:55,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

722
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:57,481
[SPEAKER_07]: My F.U.

723
01:00:57,501 --> 01:01:00,663
[SPEAKER_07]: of the week goes to potstickers because they're really addicting.

724
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:05,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't stop eating potstickers.

725
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,989
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the food I've been craving.

726
01:01:08,129 --> 01:01:13,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Anytime I go out to a restaurant that might have them, I have to get potstickers because they're so freaking addicting.

727
01:01:13,453 --> 01:01:16,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I'm pregnant or something and craving things I don't usually crave before.

728
01:01:16,816 --> 01:01:18,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And that food is potstickers.

729
01:01:19,138 --> 01:01:20,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it's so random, but that's what it is.

730
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,961
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing a gas baby.

731
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:23,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently.

732
01:01:23,581 --> 01:01:24,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently.

733
01:01:25,393 --> 01:01:27,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So F you to potstickers for being so non-malicious.

734
01:01:28,576 --> 01:01:28,956
[SPEAKER_07]: There you have it.

735
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:34,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've learned you can get potstickers lots of different places.

736
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:37,704
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty surprising, and I've probably sampled them everywhere.

737
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:40,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, hey, let's move back into some gaming news.

738
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:42,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try to get this show actually back on the track of gaming.

739
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:44,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Quest X is going to be on Wii

740
01:02:07,037 --> 01:02:08,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty cool.

741
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:16,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also going to be, as far as I'm aware, the first of the Dragon Quest games on the Wii, so that's pretty cool.

742
01:02:17,425 --> 01:02:24,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Japanese release date, by the way, for Dragon Quest IX is going to be March 28th.

743
01:02:25,271 --> 01:02:27,993
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be 5980 yen.

744
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:29,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

745
01:02:31,696 --> 01:02:33,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

746
01:02:33,697 --> 01:02:35,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other cool stuff that will be...

747
01:02:37,281 --> 01:02:39,362
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

748
01:02:57,592 --> 01:03:07,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now, apparently, a used copy of the game Scrabble, which apparently learns words based on stuff that you add in there.

749
01:03:11,206 --> 01:03:18,934
[SPEAKER_05]: This kid actually was playing it, and apparently Scrabble beat him on a triple word score with the word fuckers.

750
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:27,613
[SPEAKER_05]: and apparently the mother of... That's what I call my DS when it beats me at a game.

751
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:28,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucker!

752
01:03:28,873 --> 01:03:41,540
[SPEAKER_05]: The mother, I guess, apparently, Tonya, she had bought this game for her son, Ethan, and it was a pre-owned copy, I guess, of Ubisoft Scrabble, which I didn't realize... I don't think they have that over here.

753
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish they did, because Scrabble's awesome.

754
01:03:44,181 --> 01:03:44,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

755
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:46,248
[SPEAKER_05]: DS Over His Shoulder

756
01:04:05,705 --> 01:04:07,246
[SPEAKER_07]: How else did she find out about it?

757
01:04:25,774 --> 01:04:33,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently, you know, this, you know, is coming from, I guess... You know what she should have done is simply challenged the word.

758
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:36,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't think you'd be able to find it in the official Scrabble dictionary.

759
01:04:37,742 --> 01:04:41,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently, this is coming from a tabloid, Daily Mail.

760
01:04:41,525 --> 01:04:44,687
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're hosts of a bunch of useless articles.

761
01:04:44,707 --> 01:04:45,307
[SPEAKER_01]: So reliable?

762
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

763
01:04:46,908 --> 01:04:56,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Ubisoft is saying that she should have used the game's junior settings, because I guess Fuckers isn't in the junior version of Scrabble, and Nintendo, of course, doesn't want anything to do with it.

764
01:04:56,554 --> 01:04:58,616
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we'll just use, you know, Lil' Fucker.

765
01:04:58,816 --> 01:05:00,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

766
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,959
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

767
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:06,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

768
01:05:07,455 --> 01:05:14,564
[SPEAKER_05]: J100 Matt in chat says, why do these fucking kids need to tell their parents that their games are cursing at them?

769
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:24,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I would laugh.

770
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:25,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think that's awesome.

771
01:05:25,733 --> 01:05:26,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I would show it to my friends.

772
01:05:26,974 --> 01:05:28,095
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're supposed to do.

773
01:05:28,955 --> 01:05:31,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at my boy, dude.

774
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:34,439
[SPEAKER_05]: He spelled tits on triple word.

775
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:39,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of little Ethan going, Mommy, Mommy, my game swore at me.

776
01:05:39,703 --> 01:05:40,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling.

777
01:05:41,644 --> 01:05:42,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Little punk kid.

778
01:05:43,445 --> 01:05:45,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's actually a version of Scrabble.

779
01:05:45,587 --> 01:05:50,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And you want to know, she's totally grooming him to be a little wuss anyways.

780
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Him and his pink DS.

781
01:05:55,046 --> 01:05:55,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, wait a minute.

782
01:05:56,647 --> 01:05:57,047
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, here.

783
01:05:59,828 --> 01:06:01,489
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's some type of Scrabbles.

784
01:06:01,509 --> 01:06:04,010
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how every board game has their own house rules?

785
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:11,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Like in Monopoly, you might have a house rule where all the tax money goes into a free parking jackpot for when you land on free parking, right?

786
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:17,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think there's some house rules for Scrabbles where dirty words automatically are triple word score.

787
01:06:18,036 --> 01:06:20,357
[SPEAKER_07]: So it encourages people to use bad words.

788
01:06:20,497 --> 01:06:21,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we do that all the time.

789
01:06:22,137 --> 01:06:22,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

790
01:06:23,806 --> 01:06:25,907
[SPEAKER_05]: We even played Ebonics Scrabble one time.

791
01:06:26,387 --> 01:06:28,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

792
01:06:29,509 --> 01:06:30,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

793
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:31,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

794
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,651
[SPEAKER_07]: If it sounded like a word, it was a word.

795
01:06:37,033 --> 01:06:38,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to play that sometime.

796
01:06:38,073 --> 01:06:38,593
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be fun.

797
01:06:42,155 --> 01:06:42,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

798
01:06:44,606 --> 01:06:52,690
[SPEAKER_07]: One game I was mad when they discontinued many years ago and made me yell, Fuckers, was when they got rid of the Great Giana Sisters.

799
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:56,612
[SPEAKER_07]: 1987 was the year that this game was originally released, and it was pretty awesome.

800
01:06:56,652 --> 01:07:01,074
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on the Commodore 64, but the problem was, it looked and felt just like Mario.

801
01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:03,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, if you actually played it, there was a lot of differences.

802
01:07:03,635 --> 01:07:09,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for instance, hello, in the Great Giana Sisters, you actually fight a giant enemy crab at the end of the second level.

803
01:07:10,378 --> 01:07:12,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, this predates even the PlayStation 3, but unfortunately...

804
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

805
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:42,857
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

806
01:07:55,362 --> 01:08:02,527
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have over 80 levels, and apparently the DS microphone is going to play into the game somehow, and they'll actually use the touchscreen and everything.

807
01:08:03,267 --> 01:08:12,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, one of the great things about the original game was the soundtrack, and the new version, Chris Hilsbeck, is coming back to do remixed versions of the original soundtrack.

808
01:08:13,354 --> 01:08:14,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome.

809
01:08:16,696 --> 01:08:23,838
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is one of those games where, you know, if you've never played this game, maybe some week we'll highlight it as a classic game of the week down the road.

810
01:08:23,878 --> 01:08:26,620
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's one of those games you definitely should check out.

811
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's clips on YouTube of the game.

812
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:31,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And just, you know, you can see its similarities to Mario Bros.

813
01:08:31,562 --> 01:08:32,882
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was kind of neat.

814
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,963
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a fun game, especially for that era.

815
01:08:36,163 --> 01:08:41,886
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it doesn't really hold up against today's games, which is why I'm interested to see kind of what they do to it on the...

816
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,561
[SPEAKER_07]: DS version, how they're going to make it unique.

817
01:08:45,581 --> 01:08:47,923
[SPEAKER_07]: But based on the screenshots, it looks a lot different.

818
01:08:47,943 --> 01:08:50,084
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely doesn't look like Mario anymore, that's for sure.

819
01:08:51,706 --> 01:08:52,026
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

820
01:08:53,687 --> 01:08:54,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

821
01:08:55,789 --> 01:08:59,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving forward, it looks like we've actually got some release dates.

822
01:09:00,393 --> 01:09:01,273
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that sound?

823
01:09:01,373 --> 01:09:02,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Release dates!

824
01:09:02,995 --> 01:09:05,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is December, so what else can we expect?

825
01:09:06,237 --> 01:09:08,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go ahead and take a look.

826
01:09:08,956 --> 01:09:09,536
[SPEAKER_07]: For the UK.

827
01:09:09,837 --> 01:09:12,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, for the UK.

828
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:19,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's Crash Commando and Sonic Unleashed.

829
01:09:20,582 --> 01:09:21,423
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it.

830
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:24,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to be a little bit more excited, but I guess not.

831
01:09:26,536 --> 01:09:28,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say things are much better in the US, though.

832
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:35,682
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a few things coming out, so it's not that bad, but it's certainly not in November or anything like that.

833
01:09:36,443 --> 01:09:38,144
[SPEAKER_05]: This week, though, some of the highlights.

834
01:09:39,365 --> 01:09:41,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Rise of the Argonauts will be coming out on all systems.

835
01:09:42,007 --> 01:09:44,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

836
01:09:45,709 --> 01:09:49,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, this week, we've got the release of some DS games.

837
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:52,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Kate West, The Vanishing Files...

838
01:09:54,396 --> 01:09:57,142
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also got Mystery PI, Portrait of a Thief

839
01:09:59,172 --> 01:10:01,393
[SPEAKER_05]: and Dreamer Horse Training.

840
01:10:01,653 --> 01:10:05,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, goddammit, there's not enough horse training games.

841
01:10:05,894 --> 01:10:07,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Puppy Training, which has a really cute cover.

842
01:10:08,315 --> 01:10:08,795
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

843
01:10:09,975 --> 01:10:12,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Slingo Quest, also coming out from DS.

844
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:14,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mumbo-jumbo casual game.

845
01:10:15,897 --> 01:10:20,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And Neopets Puzzle Adventure, ripping off Puzzle Quest there.

846
01:10:22,339 --> 01:10:23,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see...

847
01:10:25,709 --> 01:10:28,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of crappy DS games this week, man, I swear.

848
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:34,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia Zoo Quest, which is a puzzle game and for some reason has Saberwin on the cover.

849
01:10:35,635 --> 01:10:36,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, crikey indeed.

850
01:10:37,996 --> 01:10:42,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Learn Math for grades 1 through 4, a math learning game.

851
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Driver's Ed Portable on DS.

852
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can learn how to drive.

853
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,502
[SPEAKER_05]: and other things other than DS games.

854
01:10:51,742 --> 01:10:54,624
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few Destiny or Wii games.

855
01:10:54,984 --> 01:11:00,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Summer Sports 2, Island Sports Party, their party game, and Wurjong Party.

856
01:11:00,647 --> 01:11:02,989
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Mahjong party game.

857
01:11:03,729 --> 01:11:04,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

858
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:09,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rock Band 2 on the Wii.

859
01:11:10,173 --> 01:11:12,775
[SPEAKER_05]: The game-only version will be coming out on the 18th.

860
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:21,341
[SPEAKER_05]: and, uh, I just gotta mention this on the 19th, Calvin Tucker's Redneck Jamboree.

861
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:22,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, goody.

862
01:11:23,122 --> 01:11:23,682
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Wii.

863
01:11:24,663 --> 01:11:24,963
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

864
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:31,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, if you want a busy week for game releases, you need to look at Japan, because there's tons of stuff coming out in Japan this week.

865
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:37,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, granted, a lot of it is localized versions of stuff we've already had here in the US, but let me talk about what's coming out in Japan.

866
01:11:38,266 --> 01:11:39,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting with 360, we have just that.

867
01:11:39,968 --> 01:11:41,729
[SPEAKER_07]: A big release for Japan would be Fable 2.

868
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:44,091
[SPEAKER_07]: The localized version is coming out this week, December 18th.

869
01:11:45,493 --> 01:11:51,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Lego Batman, Need for Speed Undercover, and Prince of Persia also all being released on the 360 in Japan this week.

870
01:11:51,278 --> 01:11:55,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Also a game local for Japan, Gundam Musou 2 comes out in Japan.

871
01:11:55,723 --> 01:12:00,448
[SPEAKER_07]: And this game is a shooter that looks to be probably based on Gundam.

872
01:12:01,772 --> 01:12:03,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, robots with guns.

873
01:12:03,813 --> 01:12:04,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2.

874
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:05,654
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

875
01:12:06,434 --> 01:12:08,275
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is coming on the Xbox 360 this week.

876
01:12:08,895 --> 01:12:11,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to the PlayStation 3, many of those same titles.

877
01:12:11,316 --> 01:12:13,217
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also Gundam Musou 2 comes out there as well.

878
01:12:13,977 --> 01:12:19,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Lego Batman, Medal of Honor gets a price drop, as does the Godfather and Armored Core.

879
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,741
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you've got to look forward to on the PlayStation 3.

880
01:12:22,944 --> 01:12:28,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I do want to point out there's also a wireless keypad available now in Japan if you want to check that out.

881
01:12:28,489 --> 01:12:31,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, on the Wii, they have a game called Let's Tap.

882
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:33,553
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out from Sega in Japan.

883
01:12:33,573 --> 01:12:35,914
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one where it's the game that penguins can play.

884
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:37,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

885
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,757
[SPEAKER_05]: A game that even penguins can play.

886
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:43,060
[SPEAKER_05]: You set the Wiimote on the box and you tap the box.

887
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,022
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't actually use the controller at all.

888
01:12:45,042 --> 01:12:45,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

889
01:12:45,522 --> 01:12:45,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

890
01:12:46,123 --> 01:12:46,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of looks interesting.

891
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:49,906
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all these little visualizers and things.

892
01:12:50,026 --> 01:12:51,507
[SPEAKER_07]: They're bringing that over here, right?

893
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:56,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Bleach vs. Crusade Dance Dance Revolution Furu Furu Party Elebits Price Reduction

894
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:22,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, going on the PlayStation 2, a little game called Beatmania 2DX gets its 15th game in the series on PlayStation 2 this week.

895
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,656
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Troopers comes out on December 18th.

896
01:13:25,357 --> 01:13:31,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the 15th game on the PlayStation, however, because they didn't start with... They started on 3rd style.

897
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:34,982
[SPEAKER_07]: But this would be the 12th game on the PlayStation 2 in the 2DX series.

898
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:38,024
[SPEAKER_07]: In Japan only, that's not even counting the one we got in the U.S.,

899
01:13:39,305 --> 01:13:52,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Fate Unlimited Codes is also coming out on the Playstation 2 as well as another version of Gundam Musou 2 for the Playstation 2 and Pachinko Series Volume 13 Neon Genesis Evangelion yet another one

01:13:54,293 --> 01:13:54,933

[SPEAKER_07]: Yumei Miru, 4Gen, no, Primadonna.

902
01:14:26,823 --> 01:14:27,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you like Primadonnas?

903
01:14:28,704 --> 01:14:32,085
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I'm watching Bush get a shoe thrown at him and that's pretty fucking funny.

904
01:14:32,145 --> 01:14:32,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Top it.

905
01:14:33,086 --> 01:14:35,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Lego Batman also comes out.

906
01:14:36,747 --> 01:14:40,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Gensu Suikoden Tier Kreese comes out.

907
01:14:40,129 --> 01:14:42,070
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the Suikoden's strategical title.

908
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a busy week in DS world.

909
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:48,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as the PSP goes, all the other systems are getting love.

910
01:14:48,093 --> 01:14:48,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not the PSP?

911
01:14:49,413 --> 01:14:51,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, Final Fantasy Dissida.

912
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:52,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Star Wars The Clone Wars

01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:19,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Need for Speed Undercover, Samurai Shodown Anthology, Ultimate Board Game Collection, all on the PSP.

914
01:15:19,172 --> 01:15:21,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Very busy week in Japan for releases.

915
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:22,994
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

916
01:15:24,235 --> 01:15:25,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with more news.

917
01:15:26,217 --> 01:15:27,557
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to take a quick break here.

918
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is a little bit more.

919
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:35,243
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually has to do with some...

920
01:15:38,015 --> 01:15:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: with something having to do with Rockstar.

921
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:43,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think it already happened.

922
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:54,345
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a social club event put out by Rockstar for Midnight Club Los Angeles and Grand Theft Auto 4 that was going on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

923
01:15:55,545 --> 01:16:03,030
[SPEAKER_02]: They were supposed to have a little contest as in a video editor contest for GTA 4 PC and

924
01:16:05,131 --> 01:16:12,554
[SPEAKER_02]: and then for topping the Midnight Club Ocean to LA time trial and there were supposed to be prizes available for both.

925
01:16:13,814 --> 01:16:26,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It was though already going on and I do believe it was from 5 to 9 UK time actually I think today so already gone.

926
01:16:26,798 --> 01:16:28,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck to whoever won.

927
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:31,660
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

928
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:48,313
[SPEAKER_05]: um some other fun stuff um prototype um you may remember this game being kind of like an open world uh crackdown meets you know kind of mutants type of thing um

929
01:16:49,628 --> 01:16:50,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

930
01:17:07,283 --> 01:17:10,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was all sorts of different gameplay videos and stuff like that.

931
01:17:12,184 --> 01:17:14,905
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that was supposed to be stuff that they were showing off at CES.

932
01:17:14,965 --> 01:17:27,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, a few, I guess a day later or so, the whole was covered back up and the countdown back to CES was put back on the website.

933
01:17:28,647 --> 01:17:33,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the funny thing is about all that, that's what they want you to think, you see.

934
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:35,869
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole...

935
01:17:36,914 --> 01:17:39,295
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole leak was a hoax, actually.

936
01:17:40,716 --> 01:17:42,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Perpetrated... Do people know that?

937
01:17:43,157 --> 01:17:43,297
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

938
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:48,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Perpetrated by... So wait, you're saying the game blogs all got punk this week?

939
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they all got punk this week.

940
01:17:50,821 --> 01:17:53,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Perpetrated by their marketing team.

941
01:17:54,443 --> 01:17:55,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And how do you know this?

942
01:17:55,424 --> 01:17:56,144
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making this up.

943
01:17:56,184 --> 01:17:56,984
[SPEAKER_05]: You make this shit up.

944
01:17:57,204 --> 01:17:58,145
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't make this shit up.

945
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this because they sent out an email boasting about it.

946
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:05,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's all a ruse.

947
01:18:05,852 --> 01:18:06,232
[SPEAKER_05]: To who?

948
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:06,712
[SPEAKER_07]: To you?

949
01:18:07,012 --> 01:18:09,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would Activision send you an email boasting about it?

950
01:18:09,574 --> 01:18:19,260
[SPEAKER_05]: They send it to all of their retail partners to let their customers know because they're trying to drive up buzz for prototyping because...

951
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:24,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody loves leaked assets, and so they're going to start talking about it.

952
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:28,728
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was just a release of assets, it might not have been getting as much attention.

953
01:18:29,009 --> 01:18:32,872
[SPEAKER_05]: But since it was something forbidden, people are interested in it.

954
01:18:32,992 --> 01:18:33,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And it worked.

955
01:18:34,033 --> 01:18:38,297
[SPEAKER_05]: It got them all to cover this leak and got all the information out there.

956
01:18:38,598 --> 01:18:43,863
[SPEAKER_05]: The videos were ranked pretty high in game trailers, and that's all good news.

957
01:18:44,403 --> 01:18:45,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Good buzz for them.

958
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:47,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people want to see things they're not supposed to be seeing.

959
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:48,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

960
01:18:48,066 --> 01:18:49,326
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a hoax the whole time.

961
01:18:49,466 --> 01:18:50,807
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole time it was a hoax.

962
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:57,132
[SPEAKER_05]: They made it look like it was an FTP directory and everything, and they got you all.

963
01:18:59,213 --> 01:19:00,294
[SPEAKER_07]: And people don't know this yet.

964
01:19:01,054 --> 01:19:01,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the one telling them.

965
01:19:02,595 --> 01:19:06,358
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't know it, but it doesn't really matter, because the game looks awesome.

966
01:19:07,179 --> 01:19:13,523
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing is they're tricking the people that they normally work with in the media to cover their game.

967
01:19:14,051 --> 01:19:17,533
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they... Surely these people are going to find out eventually if they haven't already.

968
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:19,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think there's going to be retaliation?

969
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:19,474
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

970
01:19:20,554 --> 01:19:22,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this stuff happens all the time, to be honest.

971
01:19:22,536 --> 01:19:24,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, here's another thing, though.

972
01:19:24,256 --> 01:19:29,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Could they be saying now that, oh, yeah, we meant for that to happen, when maybe they didn't?

973
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:30,960
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was in great detail.

974
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:38,284
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, you know who tipped them off that the site had been broken?

975
01:19:40,219 --> 01:19:40,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

976
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:04,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, survey sites and stuff like that and you may think, hey, why aren't these publishers doing anything to stop these leaks?

977
01:20:04,807 --> 01:20:10,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they're intentional and sometimes that's how they drive buzz for stuff.

978
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little bit of insight in the back workings of the...

979
01:20:15,074 --> 01:20:16,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Publishing World

980
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the game looks awesome.

981
01:20:46,721 --> 01:20:48,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's going to be a really fun game.

982
01:20:48,783 --> 01:20:51,625
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely going to be something I pick up because it's like crackdown.

983
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:52,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

984
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:54,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely something I'll be playing.

985
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:57,257
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

986
01:20:57,657 --> 01:21:00,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, moving on before we take a break here on the show.

987
01:21:00,798 --> 01:21:02,099
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a pretty big bombshell.

988
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:03,699
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have probably said that earlier in the show.

989
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:04,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, whatever.

990
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:05,459
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that big of a deal.

991
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:08,680
[SPEAKER_07]: A little reward to those who actually pay attention to the whole thing, I guess.

992
01:21:10,061 --> 01:21:13,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, reward for being persistent and working at things.

993
01:21:15,142 --> 01:21:18,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really gaming news, but kind of a gaming funny, I guess you could say.

994
01:21:19,384 --> 01:21:20,364
[SPEAKER_07]: At Missouri State...

995
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:21,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

996
01:21:38,459 --> 01:21:42,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So knowing that, he realized, it's in the next room.

997
01:21:42,722 --> 01:21:44,783
[SPEAKER_07]: No, well, not necessarily, but he knew it was 30 feet away.

998
01:21:45,103 --> 01:21:55,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So through the process of elimination, what he did, he actually went to the 4th, 5th, and 6th floors and found that the controller still worked on the 4th floor, 5th floor, and 6th floor, but it would not work on the 3rd or 7th floor.

999
01:21:56,351 --> 01:21:58,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So process of elimination, where was the Xbox?

1000
01:21:58,692 --> 01:22:00,113
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 5th floor, the middle one, right?

1001
01:22:00,433 --> 01:22:06,536
[SPEAKER_07]: So then he went to the fifth floor and using the... Because if you get too far from the Xbox, the thing will start blinking.

1002
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:10,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So using the process of elimination, he found out where the center was.

1003
01:22:10,298 --> 01:22:11,198
[SPEAKER_01]: He was hot and cold.

1004
01:22:11,678 --> 01:22:12,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, yeah.

1005
01:22:12,118 --> 01:22:13,539
[SPEAKER_07]: He was playing hot and cold with his controller.

1006
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:15,940
[SPEAKER_07]: And it told him exactly where the stolen Xbox was.

1007
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:22,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And they actually got the RA, the resident assistant, to go into the room where the stolen Xbox supposedly was.

1008
01:22:23,263 --> 01:22:24,284
[SPEAKER_07]: They found the Xbox.

1009
01:22:24,724 --> 01:22:27,965
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, what's really funny about it is that the...

1010
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:32,867
[SPEAKER_07]: The Thief wasn't around when they got it, so kind of interesting.

1011
01:22:32,887 --> 01:22:33,728
[SPEAKER_02]: But they know who lives there.

1012
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:34,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1013
01:22:35,929 --> 01:22:36,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, interesting.

1014
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:40,910
[SPEAKER_02]: See, people actually do have a brain in college.

1015
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:41,831
[SPEAKER_05]: People are retarded.

1016
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:43,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, some people have a brain in college.

1017
01:22:44,032 --> 01:22:46,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the person who stole it obviously doesn't have a brain.

1018
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:46,893
[SPEAKER_05]: They're retarded.

1019
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:48,073
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be going home.

1020
01:22:48,854 --> 01:22:49,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1021
01:22:50,474 --> 01:22:55,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I'd be pressing charges, but that would be me, because, you know, I totally don't care.

1022
01:22:58,671 --> 01:22:59,812
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a stupid award.

1023
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:01,193
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way.

1024
01:23:01,213 --> 01:23:02,413
[SPEAKER_02]: For the loser that stole it.

1025
01:23:02,554 --> 01:23:07,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, but the thing is, I more give props to the guy who used the investigative skills to figure it out.

1026
01:23:07,417 --> 01:23:07,977
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1027
01:23:07,997 --> 01:23:10,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like a spy versus spy award.

1028
01:23:10,499 --> 01:23:12,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I guess you could say.

1029
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,981
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of both at once.

1030
01:23:14,882 --> 01:23:15,422
[SPEAKER_07]: A good job.

1031
01:23:15,902 --> 01:23:17,623
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like, what do they call it?

1032
01:23:17,643 --> 01:23:18,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job, gumshoe.

1033
01:23:18,704 --> 01:23:19,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember Carmen Sandiego?

1034
01:23:19,845 --> 01:23:20,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1035
01:23:20,105 --> 01:23:21,546
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's the gumshoe of the week award.

1036
01:23:21,806 --> 01:23:24,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I almost actually bought that game on PC last year.

1037
01:23:24,676 --> 01:23:25,918
[SPEAKER_07]: What, Where in the World is Karma San Diego?

1038
01:23:26,018 --> 01:23:26,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1039
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,119
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is awesome.

1040
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it at the thrift store.

1041
01:23:28,701 --> 01:23:30,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that one of those games you can do on GameTap?

1042
01:23:30,484 --> 01:23:31,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure it is.

1043
01:23:31,245 --> 01:23:31,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have GameTap.

1044
01:23:31,986 --> 01:23:32,567
[SPEAKER_07]: The old school ones.

1045
01:23:33,348 --> 01:23:33,608
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1046
01:23:33,748 --> 01:23:40,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I have ZSNES and Magic Engine and, oh, wait, I actually have the systems too.

1047
01:23:40,577 --> 01:23:40,838
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1048
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:43,441
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1049
01:23:56,155 --> 01:23:56,875
[SPEAKER_07]: You okay there, Loki?

1050
01:23:56,915 --> 01:23:57,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1051
01:23:57,696 --> 01:23:59,676
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just so excited, you're just throwing your microphone.

1052
01:23:59,716 --> 01:24:00,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

1053
01:24:00,276 --> 01:24:00,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1054
01:24:01,477 --> 01:24:05,818
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what should the kids be playing this week in the classic video game of the week?

1055
01:24:06,038 --> 01:24:10,760
[SPEAKER_02]: The classic game of the week is Willow for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1056
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,760
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's hilarious?

1057
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just thinking about this game today.

1058
01:24:13,921 --> 01:24:14,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I shit you not.

1059
01:24:14,681 --> 01:24:18,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was actually thinking, like, this game needs to be highlighted as the classic game of the week.

1060
01:24:19,003 --> 01:24:23,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And I swear to God, like, before I read that you were picking it for tonight, it was amazing.

1061
01:24:23,464 --> 01:24:31,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have to then skip about a minute 25 in the music, because it has the music I like, which is the actual kicking ass outside the village music.

1062
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:33,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1063
01:24:35,893 --> 01:24:41,657
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1064
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,979
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

1065
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:46,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like some of the best video game music ever.

1066
01:24:47,121 --> 01:24:50,183
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what other game is awesome that's also based off a movie?

1067
01:24:50,423 --> 01:24:50,603
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1068
01:24:50,703 --> 01:24:51,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Addams Family.

1069
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:53,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Fester's Quest was shit.

1070
01:24:55,104 --> 01:24:55,844
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty cool.

1071
01:24:56,904 --> 01:24:58,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to Willow.

1072
01:24:59,865 --> 01:25:00,505
[SPEAKER_02]: The game came out in 1989.

1073
01:25:00,605 --> 01:25:05,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually came out for the Famicom first in 1988.

1074
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:10,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it actually came out in 1989 on both systems, but the movie came out in 88.

1075
01:25:11,528 --> 01:25:16,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you play as Willow and you go by yourself.

1076
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:21,915
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's kind of Zelda-ish, but not really.

1077
01:25:22,055 --> 01:25:28,943
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like, um, kind of playing like Secret of Mana did, actually, but being a Nintendo NES game.

1078
01:25:29,584 --> 01:25:33,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it was put out by Capcom, so it's one of the cool things that Capcom has given us.

1079
01:25:33,889 --> 01:25:35,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we have Willow in a Capcom game, huh?

1080
01:25:38,245 --> 01:25:41,647
[SPEAKER_07]: There are also other... I'm thinking licensing for the movie is an issue.

1081
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:42,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm joking, right.

1082
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:44,028
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also other games.

1083
01:25:44,048 --> 01:25:56,933
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a computer game that came out on Amiga, Atari ST, and a DOS game that came out by a Midnight Entertainment Group, but it wasn't the same game.

1084
01:25:56,993 --> 01:25:57,793
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a different one.

1085
01:25:57,813 --> 01:25:59,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyone who's thinking they've got it, you're wrong.

1086
01:26:00,234 --> 01:26:02,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, I'm surprised I never played that.

1087
01:26:02,815 --> 01:26:03,395
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool, though.

1088
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:10,677
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also an arcade version, but it was action adventure, and again, it's not like this one.

1089
01:26:10,697 --> 01:26:12,858
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is an action RPG.

1090
01:26:13,518 --> 01:26:21,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a pretty cool little game, and you can get, you know, basically your items and weapons and meet people from the game and go talk to stuff.

1091
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It's RPG, but it was Willow, and it was pretty cool.

1092
01:26:24,641 --> 01:26:27,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, you know, it had acorns that turned people into stone.

1093
01:26:28,422 --> 01:26:28,802
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1094
01:26:31,454 --> 01:26:32,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this game.

1095
01:26:33,035 --> 01:26:36,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So do I. Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1096
01:26:37,076 --> 01:26:39,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Willow on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1097
01:26:40,077 --> 01:26:44,178
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a complete walkthrough there on YouTube that we were kind of playing the music from there.

1098
01:26:44,538 --> 01:26:46,159
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just watch somebody blast through the game.

1099
01:26:46,179 --> 01:26:49,740
[SPEAKER_07]: They use cheat codes to do it, but you still get a pretty good feel for what the game looks like there.

1100
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that game.

1101
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the crap out of that game when it came out.

1102
01:26:53,401 --> 01:26:57,642
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one of those games I rented and we held onto it for like so long because I didn't want to take it back.

1103
01:26:58,022 --> 01:26:59,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you end up having to pay for it?

1104
01:26:59,243 --> 01:26:59,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1105
01:26:59,843 --> 01:27:00,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not...

1106
01:27:00,987 --> 01:27:01,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for listening.

1107
01:27:02,048 --> 01:27:02,868
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be right back.

1108
01:27:23,223 --> 01:27:23,623
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

1109
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:44,846
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1110
01:28:13,815 --> 01:28:14,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1111
01:28:14,716 --> 01:28:14,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Spring?

1112
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:15,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Summer?

1113
01:28:15,076 --> 01:28:15,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Summer?

1114
01:28:40,049 --> 01:28:40,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1115
01:28:57,659 --> 01:28:58,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well there you go.

1116
01:28:59,441 --> 01:29:02,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry, let's get into some real news now, Loki.

1117
01:29:02,343 --> 01:29:15,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, apparently a woman from Colorado thinks she has an expert opinion of Nintendo's neglect to provide adequate support for Wii remotes.

1118
01:29:15,313 --> 01:29:16,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there is another...

1119
01:29:18,221 --> 01:29:30,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Class Action Lawsuit for Nintendo's lack of adequate straps for their Wii remotes.

1120
01:29:30,706 --> 01:29:43,472
[SPEAKER_05]: She claims that even though the new straps are thicker and they are the third version with a new plastic strap, they still fail to secure the Wii remote properly.

1121
01:29:44,801 --> 01:29:46,742
[SPEAKER_05]: to the user during strenuous use.

1122
01:29:47,442 --> 01:30:02,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Furthermore, the suit alleges that Nintendo has failed to report a single remote strap issue to the Consumer Product Safety Commission in their monthly reports, despite Nintendo's support documents prove the existence of said issues.

1123
01:30:03,346 --> 01:30:04,267
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1124
01:30:18,963 --> 01:30:24,007
[SPEAKER_05]: For one, the straps are basically there so that you don't drop the remote on the ground.

1125
01:30:24,548 --> 01:30:33,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Furthermore, then they went to reinforce them because idiots don't realize that they are just meant to prevent you from dropping them on the ground.

1126
01:30:33,835 --> 01:30:40,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they even reinforced them enough to where if you let go accidentally, it probably won't break.

1127
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's no guarantee.

1128
01:30:43,463 --> 01:30:47,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they need to put a sticker on the Wiimote that says, please touch me gently?

1129
01:30:48,004 --> 01:30:49,545
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1130
01:31:16,662 --> 01:31:19,945
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's simply just a case of consumer stupidity.

1131
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:24,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone needs to just duct tape her into someone's cellar.

1132
01:31:26,091 --> 01:31:28,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Will a judge throw this out, yes or no?

1133
01:31:28,173 --> 01:31:31,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Will a judge order her to be locked up in a cellar by duct tape?

1134
01:31:32,397 --> 01:31:35,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, duct tape is great for everything, you know.

1135
01:31:36,597 --> 01:31:38,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Duct Tape will silence the stupid masses.

1136
01:31:38,718 --> 01:31:39,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty cool, huh?

1137
01:32:05,225 --> 01:32:06,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1138
01:32:06,505 --> 01:32:15,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, should point this out, even bigger for you DS people, Pokemon Platinum, if you're still into collecting them all, Pokemon Platinum, March 22nd.

1139
01:32:16,568 --> 01:32:19,828
[SPEAKER_07]: And Circuit City had it listed, but then they pulled it.

1140
01:32:20,549 --> 01:32:22,869
[SPEAKER_07]: If that doesn't confirm it, I don't know what does.

1141
01:32:23,169 --> 01:32:29,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadow or Fire Emblem, that date is close if not accurate.

1142
01:32:29,971 --> 01:32:30,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1143
01:32:31,844 --> 01:32:33,366
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1144
01:32:52,464 --> 01:32:53,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe at CES or something?

1145
01:32:53,965 --> 01:32:55,827
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to announce some more games and stuff?

1146
01:32:55,867 --> 01:32:57,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a little bit on the Wii?

1147
01:32:57,188 --> 01:32:58,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, CES is not a gaming show.

1148
01:32:59,049 --> 01:33:01,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why people think these huge announcements are going to come out at CES.

1149
01:33:02,091 --> 01:33:03,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're going to announce them at some point.

1150
01:33:03,733 --> 01:33:09,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's only a few months off, so I would think CES being the next show... Nintendo can do their own thing.

1151
01:33:09,697 --> 01:33:11,759
[SPEAKER_07]: They can say, we got Reggie coming to a party.

1152
01:33:12,419 --> 01:33:13,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Miyamoto in the house.

1153
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And the press will show up.

1154
01:33:14,921 --> 01:33:17,904
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing, though, Rob, is I think...

1155
01:33:18,644 --> 01:33:21,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That they would do something at CES because of the DSi.

1156
01:33:21,565 --> 01:33:24,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the DSi coming out next year at some point.

1157
01:33:25,906 --> 01:33:28,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's a technology thing.

1158
01:33:28,607 --> 01:33:29,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fair enough.

1159
01:33:29,748 --> 01:33:31,708
[SPEAKER_05]: They may incorporate all into that.

1160
01:33:31,968 --> 01:33:32,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1161
01:33:32,448 --> 01:33:33,529
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a guess.

1162
01:33:35,029 --> 01:33:37,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I suppose that's an educated guess.

1163
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:40,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say it's like a 7th grade level educated guess.

1164
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:40,551
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1165
01:33:42,011 --> 01:33:42,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll see what happens.

1166
01:33:43,032 --> 01:33:43,512
[SPEAKER_07]: You might be right.

1167
01:33:44,718 --> 01:33:50,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of wanted to go to Consumer Electronics Show just for the laughs and giggles, but I won't be able to go this year, that's for sure.

1168
01:33:50,762 --> 01:33:53,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know that there are going to be gaming people there.

1169
01:33:53,083 --> 01:34:13,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's like, I got a, you know, obviously I'm not going to CES, but I got an invite for anybody that's, you know, game retailers or our customers or whatever, if they were going to CES, that they can go sit through a Microsoft presentation and they're going to show them the upcoming stuff that they've got coming out for next year or like...

1170
01:34:13,855 --> 01:34:16,276
[SPEAKER_05]: and probably just Halo Wars at that point.

1171
01:34:17,937 --> 01:34:18,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff like that.

1172
01:34:20,338 --> 01:34:21,919
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be some presence.

1173
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting bigger, I guess.

1174
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:28,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not that far off, so we will see soon if they're going to announce these officially or not.

1175
01:34:29,642 --> 01:34:31,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

1176
01:34:31,789 --> 01:34:44,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, something that is actually official is that there's going to be former members of Team Ninja and those who worked on Brawl doing a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fighter going to be on the Wii.

1177
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:47,477
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1178
01:35:02,998 --> 01:35:21,111
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping that they can pull it off I mean that would be really cool I actually did like the old 2D TMNT tournament fighters that was kind of a fun game so hopefully this will have actually I hope it has some of the characters from that series I think it would be fun

1179
01:35:22,918 --> 01:35:24,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Team Ninja equals April with Breast Physics

1180
01:35:50,969 --> 01:35:52,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

1181
01:35:53,031 --> 01:35:57,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo Wars has been announced to be coming out now on March 3rd.

1182
01:35:58,073 --> 01:36:00,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, kind of interesting.

1183
01:36:00,435 --> 01:36:08,159
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of stuff coming out right there in March, especially since I think a week before that you have Killzone 2 on the PS3.

1184
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:16,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, now of course Halo Wars is the RTS, um, kind of prequel to the whole Halo series.

1185
01:36:16,985 --> 01:36:18,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've got, um...

1186
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:19,927
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1187
01:36:48,809 --> 01:36:54,192
[SPEAKER_05]: and apparently coming out in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East the day after.

1188
01:36:56,573 --> 01:36:58,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost a worldwide release there.

1189
01:36:59,494 --> 01:37:07,178
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be interesting to see how that is because I know it's probably not going to do as well as a normal Halo game because it's not a first person shooter.

1190
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:08,299
[SPEAKER_05]: But it has a Halo name on it.

1191
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:15,222
[SPEAKER_05]: It does have a Halo name on it and there are a lot of RTS fans out there so they're hoping to kind of be like a StarCraft but

1192
01:37:16,585 --> 01:37:17,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1193
01:37:17,646 --> 01:37:18,706
[SPEAKER_05]: That's tough.

1194
01:37:36,581 --> 01:37:37,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Take this all with a grain of salt.

1195
01:37:56,827 --> 01:37:57,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1196
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:17,202
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's nice to know, especially because I guess it did pretty well on Xbox Live.

1197
01:38:17,862 --> 01:38:19,263
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to hear there's interest there again.

1198
01:38:19,523 --> 01:38:24,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope whatever this is doesn't come out on Wii, that it is another HD game.

1199
01:38:24,606 --> 01:38:25,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

1200
01:38:26,047 --> 01:38:27,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1201
01:38:27,728 --> 01:38:29,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, kind of some other things going on.

1202
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:36,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, whatever Mystery Project LMNO that was going on at EA, apparently that is now on ice right now.

1203
01:38:36,712 --> 01:38:39,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I shouldn't say gone forever, but just on hold because of all the layoffs that were going on.

1204
01:38:40,034 --> 01:38:41,135
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1205
01:39:05,865 --> 01:39:14,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, heck, what do you call this Halo 3 Dark, or no, it has a new name now, all the random numbers and letters or whatever, it's just Halo 4, right?

1206
01:39:15,391 --> 01:39:15,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1207
01:39:15,971 --> 01:39:16,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1208
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:20,634
[SPEAKER_07]: There you have it, some rumors out of Electronic Gaming Monthly.

1209
01:39:21,234 --> 01:39:22,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Take with grain of salt.

1210
01:39:22,469 --> 01:39:37,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a little bit more rumor, more like a hint, is that there could quite possibly be Halo 2, not Halo 2, Fable 2, available as a full digital download.

1211
01:39:38,316 --> 01:39:40,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty interesting.

1212
01:39:42,198 --> 01:39:45,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically when asked if...

1213
01:39:47,598 --> 01:39:53,443
[SPEAKER_02]: If there would be, the quote is, I can't say anything else on it, I would be killed to death.

1214
01:39:54,984 --> 01:39:57,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think that's pretty interesting.

1215
01:40:01,189 --> 01:40:11,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's interesting because that would be the first, at least on the Xbox 360, sorry, the PS3 already did this with the Burnout game, but on the 360 where you would have a full

1216
01:40:12,267 --> 01:40:13,188
[SPEAKER_07]: GameSpot swears they're not worried.

1217
01:40:34,343 --> 01:40:34,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, GameStop.

1218
01:40:49,611 --> 01:40:55,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely not taking away too much from buying games.

1219
01:40:55,933 --> 01:41:00,875
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, you look at the special editions and the special edition sales.

1220
01:41:00,935 --> 01:41:05,317
[SPEAKER_05]: People love their special editions and they keep getting more creative and putting more crap in there.

1221
01:41:05,757 --> 01:41:07,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in the case of Fable 2, maybe not so much.

1222
01:41:07,538 --> 01:41:09,479
[SPEAKER_05]: They start taking stuff out.

1223
01:41:10,579 --> 01:41:14,961
[SPEAKER_05]: For everything else, though, they're still getting people to buy these special editions for...

1224
01:41:16,501 --> 01:41:17,101
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of money.

1225
01:41:17,581 --> 01:41:20,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at the Legendary Edition stuff of Halo 3 and stuff.

1226
01:41:20,982 --> 01:41:23,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, by the way, I saw at Fry's this weekend for $59.99.

1227
01:41:23,303 --> 01:41:30,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, people bought a lot of those and they weren't selling as hot as people thought.

1228
01:41:30,724 --> 01:41:32,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with those Halo 3 consoles too.

1229
01:41:33,985 --> 01:41:40,586
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, it's definitely going to head that way at some point where they'll allow you to download stuff.

1230
01:41:40,686 --> 01:41:43,167
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think also people have to keep in mind...

1231
01:41:44,798 --> 01:42:06,564
[SPEAKER_05]: is it really worth it downloading a game like that especially with like a 360 you know where your system might conk out on you then you got to get a new one then you have to find some way to be able to you know have it tied to your new system and also when you're done with it you can't sell it off used which is another thing but you know that for some people that might not be a big deal

1232
01:42:08,114 --> 01:42:09,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and you only have so much room.

1233
01:42:09,495 --> 01:42:11,117
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, once your hard drive fills up, it fills up.

1234
01:42:11,217 --> 01:42:11,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1235
01:42:12,057 --> 01:42:12,898
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of the bummer.

1236
01:42:13,218 --> 01:42:15,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sure, they can release a new hard drive, but those hard drives ain't cheap.

1237
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I paid $150 for my 120GB hard drive.

1238
01:42:17,682 --> 01:42:21,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sadly enough, those hard drives, the actual parts, don't cost that much.

1239
01:42:21,626 --> 01:42:24,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the bad thing about it.

1240
01:42:24,448 --> 01:42:28,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're just laptop hard drives through a special connector.

1241
01:42:28,331 --> 01:42:30,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, don't remind me, because I'm going to get more mad.

1242
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:32,975
[SPEAKER_05]: You keep talking, Loki.

1243
01:42:33,035 --> 01:42:33,356
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey!

1244
01:42:33,416 --> 01:42:35,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey.

1245
01:42:36,616 --> 01:42:44,483
[SPEAKER_05]: But you remember, though, that is one plus, though, about the PS3, though, is they do let you upgrade your hard drive and you don't have to buy a special hard drive from them.

1246
01:42:44,563 --> 01:42:53,632
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just any hard drive will do, which I think is the way that Microsoft should have gone with their hard drives, if you ask me, but what do I know?

1247
01:42:55,310 --> 01:43:06,275
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing, I will say this, you know, despite the hard time I gave the PlayStation 3, you know, for many, many years on this program, I will say this, I will admit this, playing Prince of Persia this week, it's been nice and quiet while I've been playing the game.

1248
01:43:07,075 --> 01:43:07,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it that.

1249
01:43:08,036 --> 01:43:08,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1250
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:18,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so other things coming Fable 2's way, of course, a brand new expansion, Not Whole Island, is going to be available to download on December 22nd.

1251
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:22,442
[SPEAKER_05]: It will run you 800 Microsoft points, or that's $10 in real money.

1252
01:43:23,402 --> 01:43:24,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

1253
01:43:25,063 --> 01:43:27,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Some interesting things along with that.

1254
01:43:27,284 --> 01:43:37,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it's going to add some new costumes, a bunch of new missions, and some other fun stuff including some more achievements as well.

1255
01:43:38,724 --> 01:43:40,866
[SPEAKER_05]: There are three achievements tied with this now.

1256
01:43:41,306 --> 01:43:50,932
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the collector, which is worth 25 gamer score if you acquire all the mystery items in the box of secret shop or see another hero doing so.

1257
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:54,794
[SPEAKER_05]: The meteorologist, which is worth 50 gamer points.

1258
01:43:55,955 --> 01:44:00,678
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to bring all of Knothole Island's weather problems under control or help another hero do it.

1259
01:44:01,478 --> 01:44:05,059
[SPEAKER_05]: and The Bibliophile, which is 25 gamer points.

1260
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:10,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Find all the books detailing the history of Knothole Island or help another hero doing so.

1261
01:44:12,141 --> 01:44:13,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So, interesting.

1262
01:44:13,761 --> 01:44:15,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I may pick this up.

1263
01:44:15,301 --> 01:44:19,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure yet because I haven't really gotten to Fable 2 that much.

1264
01:44:20,803 --> 01:44:22,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I still want to go back to Lost Odyssey.

1265
01:44:22,763 --> 01:44:23,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't finished that one.

1266
01:44:23,923 --> 01:44:25,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Your wife sure did get to Fable 2, though.

1267
01:44:25,744 --> 01:44:26,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she...

1268
01:44:26,823 --> 01:44:27,704
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1269
01:44:53,769 --> 01:44:55,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1270
01:45:19,133 --> 01:45:20,514
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, you probably should get all that shit hooked.

1271
01:45:20,534 --> 01:45:24,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we don't have the adjusted TV cam tonight, you might want to get all that hooked up before we... I will.

1272
01:45:24,096 --> 01:45:26,398
[SPEAKER_07]: The minute we go off air, we can just go into that and be done.

1273
01:45:27,218 --> 01:45:33,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Left 4 Dead is another one of those games I really need to check out at some point because I usually don't like first-person shooters that much.

1274
01:45:34,163 --> 01:45:35,503
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's Valve and it's zombies.

1275
01:45:35,543 --> 01:45:36,284
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be pretty cool.

1276
01:45:36,324 --> 01:45:38,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've heard nothing but really good things about this game.

1277
01:45:38,465 --> 01:45:41,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for the fact that people have been cheating on the game.

1278
01:45:41,347 --> 01:45:42,628
[SPEAKER_07]: But guess what Valve did this week?

1279
01:45:42,668 --> 01:45:44,229
[SPEAKER_07]: They put the hammer down on that.

1280
01:45:44,609 --> 01:45:45,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1281
01:46:06,295 --> 01:46:08,076
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still do it on your local games.

1282
01:46:08,576 --> 01:46:12,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, you can still do the thing because it only fixes this when you're playing the live games online.

1283
01:46:12,918 --> 01:46:23,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically what they did is they used, there's a mod tool that you can, if you have a device to basically rip files off your hard drive, which they actually do sell them, they're like 50 bucks.

1284
01:46:23,623 --> 01:46:26,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about picking one up because I need to buy useless crap.

1285
01:46:28,345 --> 01:46:32,367
[SPEAKER_05]: You can mod a file on there and it will allow you to do different cheats.

1286
01:46:33,365 --> 01:46:33,767
[SPEAKER_05]: In the game.

1287
01:46:34,108 --> 01:46:36,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Which might be fun, because I like to cheat in games.

1288
01:46:36,477 --> 01:46:37,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah.

1289
01:46:38,444 --> 01:46:39,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go cheatin'.

1290
01:46:40,114 --> 01:46:41,235
[SPEAKER_05]: for local games at least.

1291
01:46:41,355 --> 01:46:42,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go cheatin'.

1292
01:46:42,316 --> 01:46:43,456
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a fun game.

1293
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:49,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheaters Presents, let's go cheatin'.

1294
01:46:50,381 --> 01:46:53,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean like cheating on your relationship sense.

1295
01:46:53,504 --> 01:47:00,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear, and I've seen this in our system, I know it's coming, Grey's Anatomy, the game, for Wii and the DS.

1296
01:47:00,549 --> 01:47:01,249
[SPEAKER_07]: What the shit?

1297
01:47:01,269 --> 01:47:03,411
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to make a game out of for Grey's Anatomy?

1298
01:47:03,511 --> 01:47:04,211
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want to know.

1299
01:47:04,431 --> 01:47:05,392
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing it.

1300
01:47:05,432 --> 01:47:06,733
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually have the ESRB

1301
01:47:08,274 --> 01:47:09,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to stop time.

1302
01:47:37,635 --> 01:47:38,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read this real quick.

1303
01:47:38,796 --> 01:47:39,236
[SPEAKER_05]: This is funny.

1304
01:47:39,396 --> 01:47:41,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all from the ESRB description for Grey's Anatomy.

1305
01:47:42,038 --> 01:47:43,639
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a story-based role-playing game.

1306
01:47:43,659 --> 01:47:52,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the storyline contains frequent references to sexual encounters between different characters and dialogue that contains sexual innuendo.

1307
01:47:53,004 --> 01:47:59,288
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, is there anyone in this hospital you're not going to sleep with and you want to have sex after surgery?

1308
01:47:59,508 --> 01:48:01,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about you, but that's not a sexual innuendo.

1309
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:03,551
[SPEAKER_05]: That's you want to have sex after surgery.

1310
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:08,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Some scenes take place soon after the characters have had sex.

1311
01:48:08,715 --> 01:48:17,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Dialogue also contains minor expletives, for example, hell and ass, and references to alcohol, like you, me, at a restaurant.

1312
01:48:17,923 --> 01:48:19,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, hell and ass!

1313
01:48:20,005 --> 01:48:21,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the references to alcohol.

1314
01:48:22,066 --> 01:48:24,688
[SPEAKER_05]: This game looks like crap, but that'll be funny though.

1315
01:48:25,629 --> 01:48:26,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Grey's Anatomy.

1316
01:48:26,977 --> 01:48:36,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Grey's Anatomy, The Game, Amazing Hey, I gotta read some comments from the chat about you and Nelly and the way you play Animal Crossing because they had some comments here.

1317
01:48:36,721 --> 01:48:40,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says, Animal Crossing, the game about time traveling and its effects.

1318
01:48:41,924 --> 01:48:42,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1319
01:48:43,825 --> 01:48:45,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Press Start says, Tom Nook is gonna break her legs.

1320
01:48:47,126 --> 01:48:49,047
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says, you better do what your wife says, Loki.

1321
01:48:49,067 --> 01:48:50,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to have a divorce over the Wii.

1322
01:48:51,269 --> 01:48:54,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And SSJ100Matt wonders aloud, why does Nelly have to cockblock us?

1323
01:48:55,831 --> 01:49:00,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And SSJ100Matt also makes this very winner comment about the way you play Animal Crossing.

1324
01:49:09,451 --> 01:49:12,093
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya asks if you got a blue phone box in your town.

1325
01:49:29,373 --> 01:49:35,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Dead Studios says Rocky Horror Picture Show is on Xbox Live Netflix.

1326
01:49:36,619 --> 01:49:37,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even think to look for that.

1327
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:38,440
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny?

1328
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:45,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that, and I'm not sure, I didn't know this until today, but you can actually change out what bed you have in your attic.

1329
01:49:46,026 --> 01:49:46,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you?

1330
01:49:46,707 --> 01:49:46,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1331
01:49:47,547 --> 01:49:48,628
[SPEAKER_05]: With any bed that you buy.

1332
01:49:48,948 --> 01:49:49,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, neat.

1333
01:49:49,369 --> 01:49:53,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm totally putting the regal bed in my attic.

1334
01:49:53,832 --> 01:49:55,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could decorate my damn attic.

1335
01:49:56,934 --> 01:49:58,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired of my attic looking like wood.

1336
01:49:59,779 --> 01:50:03,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Just walk up to the bottom of your bed and hit A, and it will allow you to change it.

1337
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:09,764
[SPEAKER_02]: There should just be... Oh, I like Misty says, she says, screw that, I want a TARDIS.

1338
01:50:10,225 --> 01:50:12,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have my house be a TARDIS.

1339
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:18,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of surprised they're not trying to nickel and dime us yet in Animal Crossing with releasing the stuff that you have to pay for that you can get.

1340
01:50:18,829 --> 01:50:20,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet Nellie would make them do that.

1341
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:21,971
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not that smart, though.

1342
01:50:22,011 --> 01:50:23,832
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem, though, with... Because...

1343
01:50:26,989 --> 01:50:30,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, is if they had that kind of content, it would be pay to unlock content.

1344
01:50:31,011 --> 01:50:34,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they had that in the game, someone would figure out how to hack it and unlock it already.

1345
01:50:36,813 --> 01:50:37,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they'll do that.

1346
01:50:38,074 --> 01:50:42,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like maybe, okay, the old school Nintendo games, like maybe just have the ones that I have on my virtual console.

1347
01:50:43,035 --> 01:50:43,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1348
01:50:43,556 --> 01:50:45,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's kind of dumb.

1349
01:50:45,537 --> 01:50:45,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

1350
01:50:46,977 --> 01:50:47,397
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd never do that.

1351
01:50:47,417 --> 01:50:48,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget I said anything.

1352
01:50:48,858 --> 01:50:49,098
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1353
01:50:50,777 --> 01:50:55,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to that statement of the show that we encourage you to participate with our show every week by sending us emails.

1354
01:50:55,503 --> 01:50:57,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1355
01:50:57,326 --> 01:50:58,988
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag.

1356
01:50:59,448 --> 01:51:00,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

1357
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:00,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you are.

1358
01:51:00,890 --> 01:51:01,291
[SPEAKER_07]: You better.

1359
01:51:01,311 --> 01:51:05,036
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to read a few of her favorite emails right now.

1360
01:51:05,497 --> 01:51:06,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I will subject her to watching...

1361
01:51:08,018 --> 01:51:12,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Manos, The Hands of Fate Manos, The Hands of Fate

1362
01:51:30,825 --> 01:51:33,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Number 11, I think it was, was some karate movie.

1363
01:51:33,628 --> 01:51:35,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the name of it.

1364
01:51:35,069 --> 01:51:35,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to find it.

1365
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:41,715
[SPEAKER_07]: But the trick was the one dude had no arms and the other dude had no legs.

1366
01:51:43,016 --> 01:51:43,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1367
01:51:43,977 --> 01:51:47,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were actually karate fighting in the movie.

1368
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:49,001
[SPEAKER_07]: It was amazing.

1369
01:51:49,102 --> 01:51:52,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to figure out what freaking movie it was.

1370
01:51:52,164 --> 01:51:54,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe somebody in the chat will know.

1371
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:55,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they tie themselves together?

1372
01:51:55,647 --> 01:51:55,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Astounding.

1373
01:51:56,388 --> 01:51:57,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to see this

1374
01:52:21,263 --> 01:52:22,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who put it out.

1375
01:52:22,604 --> 01:52:23,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say this.

1376
01:52:23,244 --> 01:52:25,145
[SPEAKER_07]: The documentary itself wasn't that good.

1377
01:52:25,765 --> 01:52:27,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see the movie.

1378
01:52:27,626 --> 01:52:28,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw the documentary.

1379
01:52:30,067 --> 01:52:30,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

1380
01:52:30,427 --> 01:52:31,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to see the movie.

1381
01:52:31,187 --> 01:52:33,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is not Manos the Hands of Fate on there?

1382
01:52:34,028 --> 01:52:34,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1383
01:52:34,569 --> 01:52:36,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that because they NST3K'd it?

1384
01:52:36,609 --> 01:52:37,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say Howard the Duck was on it.

1385
01:52:38,190 --> 01:52:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Howard the Duck was on it?

1386
01:52:39,531 --> 01:52:40,291
[SPEAKER_07]: As was Ishtar.

1387
01:52:40,491 --> 01:52:42,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Howard the Duck.

1388
01:52:42,832 --> 01:52:43,953
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite.

1389
01:52:44,033 --> 01:52:45,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Xanadu on there.

1390
01:52:45,793 --> 01:52:46,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Xanadu was on there.

1391
01:52:47,314 --> 01:52:47,714
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1392
01:52:48,574 --> 01:52:49,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Xanadu.

1393
01:52:50,086 --> 01:52:52,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know how Manos the Hands of Fate wasn't on here.

1394
01:52:52,047 --> 01:52:53,628
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a pretty poorly done documentary.

1395
01:52:54,049 --> 01:52:59,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they only had access to one studio's films or something, but yeah, I gotta figure out what the name of that movie was.

1396
01:52:59,972 --> 01:53:01,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, I'm getting it right now.

1397
01:53:02,474 --> 01:53:04,455
[SPEAKER_07]: If you say the name, I'll remember it.

1398
01:53:04,936 --> 01:53:06,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, DarkSakura, read some emails.

1399
01:53:06,557 --> 01:53:08,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna play music again, because we got on a tangent.

1400
01:53:08,718 --> 01:53:09,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprise!

1401
01:53:09,318 --> 01:53:09,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Fighting Life!

1402
01:53:10,439 --> 01:53:11,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1403
01:53:26,913 --> 01:53:28,635
[SPEAKER_07]: The Crippled Masters, that's what it was called.

1404
01:53:29,215 --> 01:53:30,697
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some emails?

1405
01:53:31,177 --> 01:53:31,657
[SPEAKER_02]: How about it?

1406
01:53:33,939 --> 01:53:35,381
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes from GS68.

1407
01:53:36,001 --> 01:53:37,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR crew.

1408
01:53:37,482 --> 01:53:38,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, wait, stop.

1409
01:53:38,343 --> 01:53:40,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1410
01:53:40,465 --> 01:53:41,566
[SPEAKER_05]: You had your turn.

1411
01:53:41,646 --> 01:53:46,910
[SPEAKER_05]: In The Crippled Masters, they actually attach themselves to each other to create that person that I was saying they should do it.

1412
01:53:47,831 --> 01:53:48,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1413
01:53:51,146 --> 01:53:52,207
[SPEAKER_05]: It says right here.

1414
01:53:53,267 --> 01:53:55,389
[SPEAKER_05]: The two men are disfigured by their evil leader.

1415
01:53:55,429 --> 01:53:58,570
[SPEAKER_05]: It says one man has his arms cut off, the other has his legs burned off with acid.

1416
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:01,672
[SPEAKER_05]: The two men are enemies but struggling with being disabled.

1417
01:54:01,832 --> 01:54:12,678
[SPEAKER_05]: One day fighting each other, the wise old yoga master suggests they work together and start training with weapons and team up to help them with the help of a shoulder.

1418
01:54:13,178 --> 01:54:14,379
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube trailers.

1419
01:54:14,519 --> 01:54:18,381
[SPEAKER_05]: It says with the help of a shoulder harness so that the man without the YouTube

1420
01:54:18,821 --> 01:54:20,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the trailer right now.

1421
01:54:20,422 --> 01:54:22,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Three for the other man, and vice versa.

1422
01:54:22,444 --> 01:54:24,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Three words better than Voltron.

1423
01:54:26,487 --> 01:54:27,148
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1424
01:54:27,288 --> 01:54:30,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm watching this scene where they cut his arms off.

1425
01:54:31,671 --> 01:54:32,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is pretty bad.

1426
01:54:33,773 --> 01:54:34,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

1427
01:54:35,334 --> 01:54:36,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no arms.

1428
01:54:36,655 --> 01:54:38,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you promised not to interrupt the emails now.

1429
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:41,091
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here we go.

1430
01:54:41,111 --> 01:54:41,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew!

1431
01:54:41,351 --> 01:54:42,612
[SPEAKER_02]: God, that is disgusting.

1432
01:54:43,352 --> 01:54:43,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1433
01:54:43,892 --> 01:54:44,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1434
01:54:44,233 --> 01:54:44,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1435
01:54:44,633 --> 01:54:45,053
[SPEAKER_07]: One more time.

1436
01:54:45,513 --> 01:54:46,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have a question, actually, Rob.

1437
01:54:48,255 --> 01:54:49,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Was The House Where Evil Dwells on there?

1438
01:54:49,976 --> 01:54:51,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

1439
01:54:51,878 --> 01:54:52,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

1440
01:54:52,418 --> 01:54:59,883
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the movie... They had some really fucked up movie from the 70s, though, that was like just a total gore film and had titties and butts and blood and stuff.

1441
01:54:59,903 --> 01:55:00,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember what the name was.

1442
01:55:00,683 --> 01:55:00,924
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awful.

1443
01:55:00,944 --> 01:55:02,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I love The House Where Evil Dwells.

1444
01:55:02,505 --> 01:55:04,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have a little story about this, and then I'll do email.

1445
01:55:04,486 --> 01:55:04,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Promise.

1446
01:55:04,926 --> 01:55:05,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

1447
01:55:05,507 --> 01:55:05,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1448
01:55:06,929 --> 01:55:08,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I love what Actdeft said in chat.

1449
01:55:08,590 --> 01:55:10,671
[SPEAKER_07]: The crippled masters of independent podcasting.

1450
01:55:11,151 --> 01:55:12,352
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that might be offensive, though.

1451
01:55:12,912 --> 01:55:14,433
[SPEAKER_07]: There are people that are actually handicapped.

1452
01:55:14,453 --> 01:55:17,614
[SPEAKER_02]: There are actually crippled masters out there who do podcasts.

1453
01:55:17,714 --> 01:55:21,316
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to admit, it's an awesome idea for a movie.

1454
01:55:21,396 --> 01:55:26,839
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that the people have no... But the fact that it's like that... What was that movie with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder?

1455
01:55:27,179 --> 01:55:30,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Where one was deaf and one was... See no evil, hear no evil.

1456
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:32,281
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like that, but karate.

1457
01:55:32,841 --> 01:55:33,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, sorry, Jamie.

1458
01:55:33,502 --> 01:55:33,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Your point.

1459
01:55:36,169 --> 01:55:45,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this movie, I saw it when I was like six, something like that, and it was on Showtime, back when Showtime was new.

1460
01:55:46,432 --> 01:55:50,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was at the time called The House Where Evil Dwells, and I had no idea that was the name of it.

1461
01:55:51,573 --> 01:55:57,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remembered that it's about these people that move to Japan, get possessed by ghosts, and end up killing each other.

1462
01:55:58,615 --> 01:55:59,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the ghosts killed each other.

1463
01:56:01,338 --> 01:56:07,381
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have been trying for years, I mean decades, to find this movie.

1464
01:56:07,461 --> 01:56:08,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not remember the name of it.

1465
01:56:08,922 --> 01:56:10,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so little, I didn't remember.

1466
01:56:11,043 --> 01:56:16,205
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remembered scenes from it, including the ghost-possessed crabs chasing the girl at the tree.

1467
01:56:16,686 --> 01:56:20,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why evil alien crabs always, giant alien crabs always make me crack the fuck up.

1468
01:56:20,688 --> 01:56:23,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I always remember they go to roar sound.

1469
01:56:23,829 --> 01:56:32,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, like, you hear, like, the... For lack of a better description, I guess, like, the Japanese ghost noise, you know, that sounds, like, really deep.

1470
01:56:33,299 --> 01:56:33,520
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.

1471
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1472
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:38,325
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's Broken Neck Ghost Woman.

1473
01:56:39,666 --> 01:56:40,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's more like...

1474
01:56:43,962 --> 01:56:45,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway... This show's terrible.

1475
01:56:45,563 --> 01:56:46,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Shut up!

1476
01:56:46,563 --> 01:56:59,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so... So, um... Last... It's like, I think six months ago, I finally, finally found a review of the damn movie, found the name of it, and bought it on Amazon for five bucks.

1477
01:56:59,410 --> 01:57:00,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm making you watch it with me.

1478
01:57:01,971 --> 01:57:02,451
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

1479
01:57:03,292 --> 01:57:04,632
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use that to do with me?

1480
01:57:04,793 --> 01:57:09,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but we have to find the cheerleader movie that was on that list and watch that too, because that looked amazing!

1481
01:57:09,966 --> 01:57:12,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see a cheerleader movie.

1482
01:57:13,168 --> 01:57:13,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we get to know?

1483
01:57:14,588 --> 01:57:15,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do email now?

1484
01:57:15,569 --> 01:57:15,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1485
01:57:16,629 --> 01:57:18,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you totally need to see this movie.

1486
01:57:21,491 --> 01:57:22,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1487
01:57:23,172 --> 01:57:23,612
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

1488
01:57:29,235 --> 01:57:31,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So, first email from GS68.

1489
01:57:31,536 --> 01:57:31,616
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68.

1490
01:57:33,925 --> 01:57:35,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR crew!

1491
01:57:36,167 --> 01:57:40,930
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've already covered what I just brought up in the subject line, just ignore this email.

1492
01:57:41,431 --> 01:57:53,980
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, Sunnyvale Golfland is holding a location test for the North American version of DJ Max Technica sometime next week, somewhere in the December 17th to 19th range, and I thought I'd share this with you guys.

1493
01:57:54,101 --> 01:57:58,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Kudos to Corey Virtue from Bimani Style for bringing this up.

1494
01:57:58,843 --> 01:58:04,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm texting Shane right now to get a reaction out of him because I don't know anyone that loves this game more than him and he's going to be pissed.

1495
01:58:04,768 --> 01:58:08,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage people living in NorCal who are interested in Technica to come check it out.

1496
01:58:08,831 --> 01:58:09,592
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68.

1497
01:58:09,672 --> 01:58:10,012
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1498
01:58:10,032 --> 01:58:15,977
[SPEAKER_02]: This email was brought to you by Tetris the Grandmaster, home of the ending Tetrominoes.

1499
01:58:17,258 --> 01:58:19,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1500
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:19,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I... Okay.

1501
01:58:20,921 --> 01:58:21,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So, DJ Max.

1502
01:58:22,162 --> 01:58:22,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo.

1503
01:58:22,302 --> 01:58:22,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo.

1504
01:58:24,957 --> 01:58:25,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen this new one yet?

1505
01:58:26,357 --> 01:58:27,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious to check it out.

1506
01:58:27,518 --> 01:58:28,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane made me watch YouTubes of it.

1507
01:58:28,778 --> 01:58:31,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks interesting.

1508
01:58:31,479 --> 01:58:33,220
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't look anything like the PSP one to me.

1509
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:34,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the same music.

1510
01:58:35,481 --> 01:58:36,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be curious to check it out.

1511
01:58:39,522 --> 01:58:41,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any plans next weekend.

1512
01:58:44,824 --> 01:58:45,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Cancel them.

1513
01:58:45,664 --> 01:58:49,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to Old Folsom and eating good food and shopping.

1514
01:58:49,186 --> 01:58:52,227
[SPEAKER_07]: We can eat good food and shop in the bay and play DJ Max.

1515
01:58:52,547 --> 01:58:53,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are you going with?

1516
01:58:53,905 --> 01:58:56,228
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1517
01:59:07,233 --> 01:59:13,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So, moving forward, um, hey guys, Loki, a few episodes back you said that Wii music is for five-year-olds.

1518
01:59:14,601 --> 01:59:15,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I object.

1519
01:59:15,782 --> 01:59:22,189
[SPEAKER_02]: My recently turned six brother loves to play video games, and not only games, he plays Guitar Hero 3 and Rock Band.

1520
01:59:22,269 --> 01:59:26,714
[SPEAKER_02]: He strums and he yells at me to press the buttons while we work our way through Slow Ride.

1521
01:59:27,455 --> 01:59:29,137
[SPEAKER_02]: There's your lol for the day.

1522
01:59:31,391 --> 01:59:31,751
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1523
01:59:31,952 --> 01:59:35,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Sky, put the podcast up faster.

1524
01:59:35,913 --> 01:59:36,473
[SPEAKER_02]: P.P.S.

1525
01:59:36,973 --> 01:59:38,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I pass the grammar Nazi test.

1526
01:59:39,154 --> 01:59:40,534
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Orange Lounge.

1527
01:59:40,914 --> 01:59:41,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Geekboy2424.

1528
01:59:41,474 --> 01:59:43,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of it this way.

1529
01:59:43,455 --> 01:59:45,455
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to get an awesome Christmas present pretty soon.

1530
01:59:45,475 --> 01:59:47,776
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it in an ellipsis where you're not supposed to, by the way.

1531
01:59:47,796 --> 01:59:51,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You're supposed to use two dashes, not an ellipsis.

1532
01:59:53,238 --> 01:59:54,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take care of that later.

1533
01:59:55,043 --> 01:59:56,825
[SPEAKER_02]: SuperHappyFuntimeShow

1534
02:00:14,814 --> 02:00:15,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate that show.

1535
02:00:15,754 --> 02:00:16,254
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1536
02:00:16,294 --> 02:00:16,795
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

1537
02:00:17,995 --> 02:00:21,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Please find attached our Christmas to you all at OLR.

1538
02:00:21,416 --> 02:00:25,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not sending analog versions out as we're trying to save the planet.

1539
02:00:26,117 --> 02:00:29,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great Christmas and New Year and we'll see you on the other side, whatever that means.

1540
02:00:30,458 --> 02:00:33,538
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very creative idea to do your Christmas cards digitally.

1541
02:00:34,039 --> 02:00:35,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to see some holiday cards.

1542
02:00:35,859 --> 02:00:37,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to say Christmas because that's insensitive.

1543
02:00:38,179 --> 02:00:39,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Christmas cards!

1544
02:00:41,923 --> 02:00:44,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it fucking loaded with baby Jesus.

1545
02:00:46,125 --> 02:00:47,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then fine.

1546
02:00:48,026 --> 02:00:54,350
[SPEAKER_07]: We would like to get your digital... For this week's mailbag, we would like to challenge you to send us Christmas cards, and they better be about Christmas.

1547
02:00:55,876 --> 02:00:57,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jesus and Santa and all that stuff.

1548
02:00:57,859 --> 02:01:01,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you want to do them about original Christmas.

1549
02:01:01,804 --> 02:01:06,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's with, you know, Yule Logs burning and candles on trees and druids sacrificing things.

1550
02:01:06,931 --> 02:01:07,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine, look, whatever.

1551
02:01:07,952 --> 02:01:10,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We want your Christmas cards via email this week.

1552
02:01:10,335 --> 02:01:11,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1553
02:01:13,802 --> 02:01:16,583
[SPEAKER_07]: and your banners for the PSP website dammit

1554
02:01:34,227 --> 02:01:34,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

1555
02:01:34,647 --> 02:01:36,909
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very nice and we appreciate it very much.

1556
02:01:37,689 --> 02:01:41,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually mailed all four real Christmas cards this year.

1557
02:01:42,713 --> 02:01:44,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were pretty cool.

1558
02:01:45,154 --> 02:01:46,695
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for emails, I think.

1559
02:01:47,416 --> 02:01:47,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

1560
02:01:48,416 --> 02:01:49,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, we got some spam.

1561
02:01:49,637 --> 02:01:52,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, allconfirm at ebay.com.

1562
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:53,260
[SPEAKER_02]: You shit.

1563
02:01:54,521 --> 02:01:54,761
Done?

1564
02:01:54,941 --> 02:01:55,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there you go.

1565
02:01:56,062 --> 02:02:01,065
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Back to the gaming news, Loki.

1566
02:02:01,977 --> 02:02:02,218
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1567
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:04,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's see here.

1568
02:02:04,522 --> 02:02:06,665
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some other interesting stuff.

1569
02:02:06,686 --> 02:02:10,252
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a game that I was playing quite a bit right after it came out.

1570
02:02:10,452 --> 02:02:12,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of put it off now since...

1571
02:02:13,442 --> 02:02:17,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I have other things to be playing, but I want to go back, and maybe this will entice me.

1572
02:02:18,405 --> 02:02:21,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Mercenaries 2 is getting some new download content.

1573
02:02:21,947 --> 02:02:30,312
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of teased this a little bit a while ago with their Obama and Sarah Palin characters.

1574
02:02:30,753 --> 02:02:34,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is all going to be part of the Blow It Up Again download content pack.

1575
02:02:34,855 --> 02:02:37,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to be free, and...

1576
02:02:39,173 --> 02:02:43,754
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to contain a bunch of cool stuff, including some new modes.

1577
02:02:44,454 --> 02:02:58,637
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have four new game types, including there was one that looked like a death race or something like that, and some other fun explosion-based games, which is kind of cool.

1578
02:02:59,537 --> 02:03:04,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently it will be coming out on the Marketplace December 16th.

1579
02:03:07,017 --> 02:03:07,458
[SPEAKER_05]: PS3 owners

1580
02:03:15,478 --> 02:03:26,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you want to continue to expand games that you might own, Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be offering five free download tracks, but only if you own the guitar bundle of the game.

1581
02:03:26,427 --> 02:03:31,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So not buying the game by itself, not buying the big band box, just buying guitar and game by itself.

1582
02:03:31,831 --> 02:03:34,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposedly you're going to be getting five free songs.

1583
02:03:34,533 --> 02:03:37,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the thing, it's not five pre-selected songs like it was a rock band.

1584
02:03:38,136 --> 02:03:40,478
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll just get to choose five free downloadable tracks.

1585
02:03:41,298 --> 02:03:41,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1586
02:04:01,209 --> 02:04:04,191
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's... I actually almost bought Guitar Hero World Tour.

1587
02:04:04,571 --> 02:04:09,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I just... Every song in the song list that I really, really wanted to play was pretty much already in Rock Band.

1588
02:04:09,773 --> 02:04:11,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I just... I feel bad.

1589
02:04:11,094 --> 02:04:13,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Rock Band's so much better than Guitar Hero.

1590
02:04:13,615 --> 02:04:14,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's so much more versatile.

1591
02:04:15,376 --> 02:04:17,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a lot more tracks to play.

1592
02:04:17,557 --> 02:04:20,038
[SPEAKER_07]: We met some real nice people that worked on Guitar Hero at PAX.

1593
02:04:20,059 --> 02:04:20,839
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

1594
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:25,781
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I am... One thing I am excited about, though, is the music mixer.

1595
02:04:26,342 --> 02:04:27,102
[SPEAKER_02]: The studio mode.

1596
02:04:27,542 --> 02:04:28,523
[SPEAKER_07]: It's limited.

1597
02:04:29,083 --> 02:04:29,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1598
02:04:29,543 --> 02:04:29,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1599
02:04:29,763 --> 02:04:29,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1600
02:04:31,474 --> 02:04:32,134
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

1601
02:04:34,095 --> 02:04:34,475
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1602
02:04:34,535 --> 02:04:36,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe when it comes down in price a little bit.

1603
02:04:36,795 --> 02:04:38,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the price is one thing I'm having a hard time justifying.

1604
02:04:38,916 --> 02:04:40,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I do really need a new guitar, though.

1605
02:04:40,736 --> 02:04:42,657
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I was playing the No Doubt stuff in Rock Band.

1606
02:04:42,677 --> 02:04:45,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if they get better downloads, too, I'd be on board.

1607
02:04:45,997 --> 02:04:48,038
[SPEAKER_07]: No Doubt has that album, right?

1608
02:04:48,098 --> 02:04:50,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And my roommate was watching me play it and was like, yeah, it's too bad you don't have a second guitar.

1609
02:04:50,859 --> 02:04:52,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually want to play Rock Band right now.

1610
02:04:52,039 --> 02:04:52,559
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty cool.

1611
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:56,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, oh, I need to get a second guitar anyway, because I'm still using the Explorer.

1612
02:04:56,683 --> 02:04:56,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Still.

1613
02:04:57,784 --> 02:05:00,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And TigerClaw says, why buy the game when SingStar ABBA was all you cared for?

1614
02:05:01,687 --> 02:05:04,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe I left that out of my gaming week, but I did play SingStar ABBA last night.

1615
02:05:05,631 --> 02:05:06,311
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot of fun.

1616
02:05:06,792 --> 02:05:07,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1617
02:05:08,193 --> 02:05:08,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, yep.

1618
02:05:10,035 --> 02:05:10,335
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1619
02:05:12,228 --> 02:05:16,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is definitely for the UK.

1620
02:05:17,291 --> 02:05:20,933
[SPEAKER_02]: In February, Rise of the Argonauts is going to be coming out.

1621
02:05:20,953 --> 02:05:24,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an action roleplay game that's being put out by Codemasters.

1622
02:05:30,393 --> 02:05:37,714
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already out on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 everywhere else in Europe.

1623
02:05:37,934 --> 02:05:44,835
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the UK version had some problems with actually having space for the game.

1624
02:05:45,615 --> 02:05:47,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was only a retail issue.

1625
02:05:48,596 --> 02:05:56,357
[SPEAKER_02]: The publisher actually said that they tried to get it into retail in the UK along with the others, but it was so busy they could not get it.

1626
02:05:56,657 --> 02:06:00,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it so they actually delayed the UK launch, simply for retail reasons.

1627
02:06:01,401 --> 02:06:08,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually supposed to be out in the US on February 16th, and everybody else as of Friday.

1628
02:06:10,589 --> 02:06:10,749
Hmm.

1629
02:06:11,669 --> 02:06:12,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

1630
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:14,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1631
02:06:14,992 --> 02:06:15,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1632
02:06:16,113 --> 02:06:21,097
[SPEAKER_05]: You may remember back... Man, I can't believe it's already been over a year, but...

1633
02:06:22,609 --> 02:06:23,309
[SPEAKER_05]: BioShock.

1634
02:06:23,349 --> 02:06:29,230
[SPEAKER_05]: They had some limited editions that came out that had the BioShock Big Daddy figurine with it.

1635
02:06:29,870 --> 02:06:33,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now to go with the Big Daddy is a little sister.

1636
02:06:34,131 --> 02:06:36,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll actually be able to purchase these.

1637
02:06:36,972 --> 02:06:41,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're from the Cult of Rapture.

1638
02:06:42,093 --> 02:06:44,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if they're actually being sold through the website or not.

1639
02:06:44,553 --> 02:06:49,154
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's going to be a little sister figurine that will go along with it.

1640
02:06:50,135 --> 02:06:50,755
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of neat.

1641
02:06:51,555 --> 02:06:51,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And

1642
02:06:54,232 --> 02:06:55,713
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1643
02:07:17,533 --> 02:07:43,310
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's cool about this, the mobile game actually supports local matches via Bluetooth And, remember the awesome game Pac-Man Versus, and what was so awesome about that, you could play as the ghost You can do that in this mobile version as well Now here's the thing, there is that kind of like fog or limited vision on the mobile phone But, you know what, still kind of awesome So there you go, if you're a mobile gamer and looking for a game to get

1644
02:07:44,966 --> 02:07:47,675
[SPEAKER_07]: being able to play as the ghost definitely puts a whole new twist on Pac-Man.

1645
02:07:47,915 --> 02:07:51,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's available right now in Europe and I'm sure we'll come over here soon.

1646
02:07:52,537 --> 02:07:52,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Patience.

1647
02:07:52,857 --> 02:07:53,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Patience.

1648
02:08:19,099 --> 02:08:19,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a virtue.

1649
02:08:20,679 --> 02:08:23,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, I'm not virtuous, but oh well, I have to be because I'm poor.

1650
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it now, daddy.

1651
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:28,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want the goose that lays the golden eggs?

1652
02:08:28,061 --> 02:08:29,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a goose that lays the golden egg.

1653
02:08:31,421 --> 02:08:35,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also a very stressful episode on Wondershowsen.

1654
02:08:36,182 --> 02:08:38,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Patience, patience, patience, patience, patience.

1655
02:08:39,522 --> 02:08:40,923
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I love Wondershowsen.

1656
02:08:41,203 --> 02:08:42,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sad that show didn't win.

1657
02:08:43,243 --> 02:08:44,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Jamie, you are missing out.

1658
02:08:44,883 --> 02:08:48,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, if you're going to make me watch your crappy movie, I'm making you watch Wondershowsen.

1659
02:08:49,272 --> 02:08:51,214
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a crappy movie, but it's fun crappy.

1660
02:08:51,355 --> 02:08:52,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the hot dog highway.

1661
02:08:54,398 --> 02:08:55,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Daddy!

1662
02:08:56,621 --> 02:08:57,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Mortimer!

1663
02:08:58,749 --> 02:08:59,810
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1664
02:09:20,915 --> 02:09:24,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It will pick up on Wi-Fi signals that are nearby.

1665
02:09:25,556 --> 02:09:31,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And based on those Wi-Fi signals, it will kind of create treasures for you to be able to collect.

1666
02:09:31,558 --> 02:09:34,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can actually walk around different places and find different treasures.

1667
02:09:34,819 --> 02:09:36,560
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a real-life treasure hunt, I guess.

1668
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:46,502
[SPEAKER_05]: You might also remember that, I want to say, Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops did something similar to that effect as well.

1669
02:09:46,662 --> 02:09:47,623
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I think you could...

1670
02:09:49,541 --> 02:09:52,982
[SPEAKER_05]: and get different unlockable characters based on Wi-Fi spots.

1671
02:09:53,622 --> 02:09:54,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of neat.

1672
02:09:55,303 --> 02:10:01,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I like the fact that I have to walk around to find these Wi-Fi spots, but neat nonetheless.

1673
02:10:06,446 --> 02:10:10,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this kind of like the whole geocaching thing?

1674
02:10:11,047 --> 02:10:14,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of, but not quite as cool.

1675
02:10:14,848 --> 02:10:17,809
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says, I bet the treasures are actually just open Wi-Fi networks.

1676
02:10:20,116 --> 02:10:21,010
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a treasure.

1677
02:10:22,889 --> 02:10:28,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, one more story about an announcement, possible announcement coming to Consumer Electronics Show.

1678
02:10:28,891 --> 02:10:30,011
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be some big gaming news.

1679
02:10:30,071 --> 02:10:30,851
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a rumor.

1680
02:10:31,251 --> 02:10:35,932
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it's coming from a research analyst for the firm Global Equities.

1681
02:10:36,552 --> 02:10:42,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, Microsoft could be unveiling a Zune phone at Consumer Electronics Show.

1682
02:10:43,474 --> 02:10:49,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, the Zune phone, you can guess what it's probably trying to compete with, but it's supposed to have motion enhancement features.

1683
02:10:49,296 --> 02:10:50,696
[SPEAKER_07]: It would actually have an accelerometer in it.

1684
02:10:51,236 --> 02:10:55,278
[SPEAKER_07]: A large multimedia screen in it and a keyboard, I guess, that is on the screen.

1685
02:10:56,539 --> 02:11:10,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, of course, the interesting thing about it is that, you know, although nothing is really said about gaming right away, you would think, especially with the way the other big phone is going, and especially because Microsoft has that tie-in to the 360, and they've always talked about that whole live anywhere thing.

1686
02:11:10,306 --> 02:11:14,308
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also showed off those downloadable X and A titles to the Zoom.

1687
02:11:14,828 --> 02:11:18,050
[SPEAKER_07]: This would be really a great bridge between all that.

1688
02:11:19,028 --> 02:11:23,192
[SPEAKER_07]: So especially with, you know, so many community, I mean, the community thing has really exploded out there.

1689
02:11:24,153 --> 02:11:31,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And congrats to our buddy Aaron, who appears to still be in the top, like, 15 of the games on the community games amongst all the stuff that's out there right now.

1690
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:36,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Props to him, but that would be very interesting if all these X and Y games could suddenly be playable on the phone.

1691
02:11:36,183 --> 02:11:39,206
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like they'd have this huge base of already made things.

1692
02:11:40,307 --> 02:11:40,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent idea.

1693
02:11:41,748 --> 02:11:42,089
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1694
02:11:43,567 --> 02:11:44,108
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1695
02:12:09,651 --> 02:12:13,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I would probably like doing that because it would come in handy sometimes.

1696
02:12:13,612 --> 02:12:17,153
[SPEAKER_05]: But it would all depend.

1697
02:12:17,493 --> 02:12:26,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if they made a standalone Zoom player that also played games and you can download stuff, maybe not the phone, then I might be interested in it.

1698
02:12:26,575 --> 02:12:30,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not something I'm actually going to purchase as a phone.

1699
02:12:31,756 --> 02:12:37,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Arama in chat says, Okay Microsoft, you already have smartphones and pocket PCs, phones that are on the market that's a whole lot better than iPhones.

1700
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:39,821
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need a damn Zune phone.

1701
02:12:41,741 --> 02:12:42,181
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1702
02:12:43,742 --> 02:12:45,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that does it for stories tonight.

1703
02:12:46,223 --> 02:12:47,944
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to some last minute stories in just a moment.

1704
02:12:47,984 --> 02:12:49,884
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are going to open up the Skype line right now.

1705
02:12:49,904 --> 02:12:53,746
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1706
02:12:53,766 --> 02:12:56,327
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to call and talk about the show tonight, please give us a call.

1707
02:12:56,347 --> 02:13:03,670
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only going to take a couple calls tonight because we want to make sure we have time after the show for the Justin TV thing with Tatsunoko and Capcom.

1708
02:13:03,690 --> 02:13:07,011
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to try to abbreviate this so we get Loki home on time and not in trouble.

1709
02:13:07,671 --> 02:13:09,032
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I just... Well, I appreciate that.

1710
02:13:09,072 --> 02:13:09,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need to do that.

1711
02:13:09,973 --> 02:13:11,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to stay up all night either.

1712
02:13:11,154 --> 02:13:13,015
[SPEAKER_05]: It's freaking cold in here.

1713
02:13:13,155 --> 02:13:14,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It is very cold in here.

1714
02:13:14,076 --> 02:13:17,539
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, we're going to just take a couple quick calls while we're waiting for a call.

1715
02:13:17,619 --> 02:13:19,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you want to do some last-minute stories?

1716
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:19,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1717
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:23,443
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a weird game that this...

1718
02:13:25,034 --> 02:13:25,835
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D Oz Funny Band

1719
02:13:46,872 --> 02:14:14,545
[SPEAKER_05]: and then also on that there are two sets of keys there's four keys on the bottom and three keys on the top kind of the base of the guitar and you flip the guitar over and there's six drum pads so that's kind of neat and the game itself kind of looks a little bit like you know Guitar Hero or Rock Band but what's kind of cool is the actual board that the notes scroll down is kind of curved so it's like kind of

1720
02:14:15,509 --> 02:14:18,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Suck that you can't play drums and guitar at the same time Not without it being very uncomfortable

1721
02:14:35,910 --> 02:14:46,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else that's coming out, Brutal Legend, of course, was shown off during the Video Game Awards show tonight, and EA is now bringing that game out.

1722
02:14:46,776 --> 02:15:03,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, this used to be one of the properties of NVIDIA before they got bought up by Activision, and now EA is putting out yet another game, a little bit different, not going to see Brutal Legend 2010 or something like that, but neat nonetheless.

1723
02:15:05,616 --> 02:15:08,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we were talking a little bit before about DJ Max Technica.

1724
02:15:08,799 --> 02:15:11,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, DJ Max Technica is actually coming to the DS.

1725
02:15:12,102 --> 02:15:17,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to be doing a DS game that's going to also have some DSi features as well.

1726
02:15:17,246 --> 02:15:21,749
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to also use the DSi camera and have storage support, which is kind of cool.

1727
02:15:21,909 --> 02:15:25,552
[SPEAKER_05]: But very cool to see that this is going to be coming to the DS.

1728
02:15:25,713 --> 02:15:27,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it would be perfect since it's a touchscreen game.

1729
02:15:28,395 --> 02:15:30,977
[SPEAKER_05]: And the PSP versions have done very well as well.

1730
02:15:32,196 --> 02:15:39,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, now we're finally getting calls, because apparently our Skype was on Don't Disturb or something, and I finally figured that out, thanks to a chat comment, and reset it, and now we've got a call.

1731
02:15:39,641 --> 02:15:40,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1732
02:15:41,882 --> 02:15:42,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Orange Launch Radio.

1733
02:15:43,463 --> 02:15:43,983
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Jason.

1734
02:15:44,443 --> 02:15:46,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I come from the internet.

1735
02:15:46,365 --> 02:15:48,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I was getting a little worried that no one was going to call tonight.

1736
02:15:48,646 --> 02:15:56,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, that's a little embarrassing, but then I realized... You were online the whole time, ever since you came on to do the, uh, the toss-over with, uh, Bobby.

1737
02:15:56,831 --> 02:15:59,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I usually turn it off for the first hour and a half that I got lazy tonight.

1738
02:16:01,534 --> 02:16:01,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1739
02:16:02,401 --> 02:16:03,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's up, Jason?

1740
02:16:04,362 --> 02:16:04,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, not too much.

1741
02:16:05,023 --> 02:16:06,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Just chilling in three-degree weather.

1742
02:16:07,344 --> 02:16:07,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Just chilling.

1743
02:16:07,945 --> 02:16:13,308
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it feels like here, even though you'd probably kill us if we told you how cold it actually is here.

1744
02:16:13,348 --> 02:16:15,129
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd probably be like, you fucking babies.

1745
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:17,571
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

1746
02:16:17,931 --> 02:16:22,634
[SPEAKER_06]: This weather would have frozen me if I had still lived in Arizona at the time, so I can definitely understand.

1747
02:16:23,074 --> 02:16:24,215
[SPEAKER_07]: 47 degrees out, by the way.

1748
02:16:25,336 --> 02:16:25,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Whimps.

1749
02:16:26,116 --> 02:16:27,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Whimps.

1750
02:16:27,877 --> 02:16:29,158
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what a Colorado summer?

1751
02:16:29,278 --> 02:16:29,958
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, no, I'm kidding.

1752
02:16:29,979 --> 02:16:30,539
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Jason?

1753
02:16:30,559 --> 02:16:30,739
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

1754
02:16:31,616 --> 02:16:32,036
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1755
02:16:32,076 --> 02:16:33,097
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty close, actually.

1756
02:16:35,018 --> 02:16:37,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I have had notes open ever since the start of the show.

1757
02:16:37,579 --> 02:16:37,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Home.

1758
02:16:38,199 --> 02:16:39,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray, home.

1759
02:16:41,061 --> 02:16:47,604
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny because when you said that this was something that was popular in the 90s, all of these memories came fluttering back.

1760
02:16:48,605 --> 02:16:51,086
[SPEAKER_06]: There was two things that stood out.

1761
02:16:51,826 --> 02:16:55,668
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them was a company called Worlds3D that... I remember Worlds3D.

1762
02:16:57,678 --> 02:17:02,021
[SPEAKER_06]: The sad thing is I've never actually used any of these 3D world products back then.

1763
02:17:02,462 --> 02:17:03,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have my own computer.

1764
02:17:03,602 --> 02:17:04,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I was young.

1765
02:17:04,543 --> 02:17:06,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know nearly as much as I do now.

1766
02:17:06,385 --> 02:17:07,225
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that kind of stuff.

1767
02:17:08,486 --> 02:17:10,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Worlds 3D came out and tried to do this.

1768
02:17:12,770 --> 02:17:20,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's what ZDNet, you know, the precursor to Tech TV, if that's what ZDTV spotlighted at one point.

1769
02:17:20,997 --> 02:17:23,779
[SPEAKER_06]: But I remember seeing a 3D interface for web browsing.

1770
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:24,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1771
02:17:25,763 --> 02:17:27,284
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't work.

1772
02:17:28,466 --> 02:17:29,346
[SPEAKER_06]: It's slow.

1773
02:17:29,607 --> 02:17:32,789
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a great interface for browsing the web.

1774
02:17:32,950 --> 02:17:34,391
[SPEAKER_06]: They're called web browsers.

1775
02:17:34,771 --> 02:17:36,993
[SPEAKER_06]: It presents everything in a great medium.

1776
02:17:37,634 --> 02:17:38,534
[SPEAKER_06]: What a concept.

1777
02:17:40,236 --> 02:17:42,678
[SPEAKER_06]: So you think home is just stupid, or what?

1778
02:17:45,060 --> 02:17:49,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby had it right, and I've said this to a couple people in the chat room, and I think you even echoed it at the same time.

1779
02:17:50,133 --> 02:17:53,114
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to compare it to Second Life, but you can't compare it to Second Life.

1780
02:17:53,494 --> 02:17:59,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Second Life is a game in the sense that you have production and you can play other people's production and whatnot.

1781
02:17:59,975 --> 02:18:13,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Home is an interface to, I mean, it's an alternative to the XMB, you could say, with the fact that they're trying to integrate partying and game launching and that kind of stuff.

1782
02:18:13,338 --> 02:18:18,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's a cross-media bar that says, fuck, shit, nah, and fat, you know, all that stuff, you know?

1783
02:18:20,131 --> 02:18:21,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's another interface.

1784
02:18:21,752 --> 02:18:22,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1785
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:25,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's slow and it takes forever.

1786
02:18:27,274 --> 02:18:28,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just doesn't work as well.

1787
02:18:28,895 --> 02:18:33,717
[SPEAKER_06]: While that's natural, it doesn't work on the digital mediums.

1788
02:18:33,777 --> 02:18:35,438
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that smart.

1789
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:41,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you said you've been taking notes during the show.

1790
02:18:41,201 --> 02:18:42,201
[SPEAKER_07]: What else did you want to comment on?

1791
02:18:42,862 --> 02:18:44,022
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just a lot of this.

1792
02:18:44,142 --> 02:18:44,863
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of funny.

1793
02:18:45,683 --> 02:18:47,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the things that Rye pointed out was that

1794
02:18:48,427 --> 02:18:49,209
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1795
02:19:00,117 --> 02:19:01,898
[SPEAKER_06]: That was aggravating.

1796
02:19:01,938 --> 02:19:04,419
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the worst thing I've ever seen in a game.

1797
02:19:04,479 --> 02:19:09,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that Prince of Persia is the first PlayStation 3 game I've bought that had to do the installation thing?

1798
02:19:09,261 --> 02:19:10,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And it kind of caught me off guard.

1799
02:19:11,141 --> 02:19:15,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I was like, whoa, oh, hey, I forgot PS3 games do this.

1800
02:19:15,683 --> 02:19:18,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Because all the other PS3 games I have, LittleBigPlanet didn't really do it.

1801
02:19:18,724 --> 02:19:20,265
[SPEAKER_07]: And it might have, but I totally didn't notice it.

1802
02:19:20,285 --> 02:19:20,465
[SPEAKER_05]: It did.

1803
02:19:20,765 --> 02:19:20,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it?

1804
02:19:20,965 --> 02:19:21,445
[SPEAKER_07]: It's small.

1805
02:19:22,185 --> 02:19:23,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't notice it.

1806
02:19:23,086 --> 02:19:24,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I was doing something wrong.

1807
02:19:24,146 --> 02:19:26,207
[SPEAKER_05]: You notice that there's no more stories about those anymore?

1808
02:19:26,387 --> 02:19:27,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because every game does it now.

1809
02:19:27,988 --> 02:19:28,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1810
02:19:29,028 --> 02:19:31,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually going to say and ask the same thing about LittleBigPlanet.

1811
02:19:31,892 --> 02:19:33,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember an install.

1812
02:19:33,555 --> 02:19:35,277
[SPEAKER_07]: It did it, but it's just kind of short.

1813
02:19:35,317 --> 02:19:36,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And so is the Prince of Persia one.

1814
02:19:36,959 --> 02:19:40,104
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll notice the first time you play the game, it's slow to boot up.

1815
02:19:40,444 --> 02:19:42,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, oh, this shit's installing on my hard drive right now.

1816
02:19:42,888 --> 02:19:45,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And sure enough, every time I booted it since then, boop, comes right up.

1817
02:19:46,391 --> 02:19:48,512
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just so weird to me.

1818
02:19:48,653 --> 02:19:51,294
[SPEAKER_07]: But PC games have done this for years, right?

1819
02:19:51,314 --> 02:19:52,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a PC!

1820
02:19:53,136 --> 02:19:56,618
[SPEAKER_06]: The difference between a PC is that you have to support a lot.

1821
02:19:57,038 --> 02:20:02,002
[SPEAKER_06]: In a game console, developers should already know exactly what they need to do.

1822
02:20:03,063 --> 02:20:09,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can say the same thing for download content, but... I don't know.

1823
02:20:09,908 --> 02:20:13,310
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems really weird in the way that the PC is kind of graying out

1824
02:20:15,416 --> 02:20:16,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me say this, Jason.

1825
02:20:16,597 --> 02:20:18,919
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, it's weird, but it's not a deal-breaker.

1826
02:20:19,179 --> 02:20:22,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I can put up with it, especially if it's just once at the beginning of the thing.

1827
02:20:22,682 --> 02:20:28,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I would only be more pissed off if it kept happening throughout the whole thing, which it sounds like it happens in Metal Gear Solid 4.

1828
02:20:29,367 --> 02:20:36,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny, because the first time it installs, it takes something like 10 or 20 minutes, I think, if memory serves correctly.

1829
02:20:36,624 --> 02:20:57,001
[SPEAKER_06]: and then every additional time it installs it takes about three minutes and I swear to God it's a three minute when we were playing through it and Wright was watching me play when we were playing through it and we would get to these stupid installs I would say it's a three minute Marlboro commercial because Old Snake is sitting there smoking away right in your face for three minutes and nothing else is going on

1830
02:20:57,591 --> 02:20:59,953
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just sitting there huffing and puffing.

1831
02:21:00,033 --> 02:21:04,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Comment from chat, Legend of Zaku says, Bullshit, PC games installed faster than PS3 games.

1832
02:21:04,996 --> 02:21:06,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I got three words for you.

1833
02:21:06,477 --> 02:21:07,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XI.

1834
02:21:09,259 --> 02:21:12,241
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't count download time, download patches and updates.

1835
02:21:12,281 --> 02:21:14,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, even the game itself spawns across like four CDs.

1836
02:21:15,243 --> 02:21:15,803
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

1837
02:21:15,823 --> 02:21:16,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember.

1838
02:21:16,644 --> 02:21:16,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

1839
02:21:17,044 --> 02:21:17,444
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

1840
02:21:17,464 --> 02:21:18,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been too long.

1841
02:21:18,265 --> 02:21:21,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand the point he's trying to make, that some of those PC reinstalls are very long.

1842
02:21:22,688 --> 02:21:25,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Jason, I got to rush you along because we got to take some more calls.

1843
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:27,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything else you want to comment on tonight?

1844
02:21:27,813 --> 02:21:28,113
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1845
02:21:45,874 --> 02:21:48,737
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as it's actually flourishing, it's a preview.

1846
02:21:48,797 --> 02:21:53,501
[SPEAKER_07]: But Jason, when you open it up to the masses like Sony has, that's not how everybody's going to view it.

1847
02:21:53,541 --> 02:21:57,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Because people are going to download this and go, this is home, this is bullshit, and they're not going to look at it again.

1848
02:21:57,544 --> 02:22:04,950
[SPEAKER_06]: They shrug it off as the whole beta thing, but... I mean, they pushed it to the cross-media bar.

1849
02:22:04,990 --> 02:22:05,871
[SPEAKER_07]: It's right there.

1850
02:22:07,732 --> 02:22:08,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1851
02:22:08,743 --> 02:22:11,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely popped up as soon as I found out that it was open for everybody.

1852
02:22:11,806 --> 02:22:12,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1853
02:22:12,426 --> 02:22:14,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I stand by my comment, but I certainly understand yours.

1854
02:22:15,008 --> 02:22:18,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, I think Home is going to be one of those things that's a lot cooler in a year.

1855
02:22:18,671 --> 02:22:23,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like the PS3 itself, it's not going to realize its potential for a year.

1856
02:22:23,975 --> 02:22:24,596
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good point.

1857
02:22:25,457 --> 02:22:30,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Lord knows we didn't buy our PS3 until recently because the library, we didn't care about it.

1858
02:22:31,201 --> 02:22:34,044
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have a need for Blu-ray, which has also changed now.

1859
02:22:34,084 --> 02:22:34,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Blu-ray movies, that is.

1860
02:22:35,545 --> 02:22:35,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1861
02:22:36,698 --> 02:22:40,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, it's your buddy from New York, Ranma Well, hello, buddy from New York, Ranma, how you doing?

1862
02:23:02,384 --> 02:23:03,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty good.

1863
02:23:03,204 --> 02:23:06,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I was cold earlier, but now I'm happy I'm home.

1864
02:23:06,586 --> 02:23:07,106
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

1865
02:23:08,087 --> 02:23:08,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

1866
02:23:08,787 --> 02:23:16,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to call you guys last week, but since SSJ100MAT told me you guys didn't have the 1-800 number, I had gone to an interesting... Yeah, we had issues last week, sorry.

1867
02:23:17,471 --> 02:23:18,672
[SPEAKER_07]: We had issues last week, sorry.

1868
02:23:19,892 --> 02:23:21,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't we all have issues once in a while?

1869
02:23:21,553 --> 02:23:21,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1870
02:23:22,874 --> 02:23:28,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I had gone to an interesting concert last week and called BlipFest 2008.

1871
02:23:30,677 --> 02:23:31,017
[SPEAKER_03]: BlipFestival.org

1872
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:04,921
[SPEAKER_07]: What convinced you to go out to the show?

1873
02:24:06,081 --> 02:24:06,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Chip Tunes

1874
02:24:17,745 --> 02:24:18,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1875
02:24:18,705 --> 02:24:23,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you heard these shows we did live at Penny Arcade Expo, but... I missed those.

1876
02:24:23,747 --> 02:24:24,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if Bobby's listening.

1877
02:24:24,768 --> 02:24:25,468
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll say it in chat.

1878
02:24:25,488 --> 02:24:31,771
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was a guy that actually came on who did chiptunes with his old school brick Game Boy, and he was pretty rad.

1879
02:24:31,791 --> 02:24:34,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he came in... And he was playing them, actually.

1880
02:24:35,172 --> 02:24:37,793
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't have been the last day, because we weren't there the last day because of our flight.

1881
02:24:37,833 --> 02:24:39,073
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the second day.

1882
02:24:39,273 --> 02:24:44,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So look for day two of the PAX podcast we did at All Games, and towards the end of the show is when the guy came on.

1883
02:24:44,375 --> 02:24:45,356
[SPEAKER_07]: He was pretty awesome.

1884
02:24:46,104 --> 02:24:47,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get his name or something like that?

1885
02:24:47,865 --> 02:24:50,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember it off the top of my head, sadly.

1886
02:24:50,185 --> 02:24:52,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we had it at the time, and I apologize.

1887
02:24:52,606 --> 02:24:53,686
[SPEAKER_07]: If Bobby's listening, he'll remember.

1888
02:24:55,047 --> 02:25:10,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a lot of the performers on stage were actually mixing, and with Game Boys, there was one artist up there, I think his name was Nordliff, or USK, actually had two Game Boys and basically switching back and forth through a mixer.

1889
02:25:11,992 --> 02:25:12,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1890
02:25:14,144 --> 02:25:17,186
[SPEAKER_03]: You had another group that I saw on Sunday called Starscream.

1891
02:25:17,246 --> 02:25:22,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much what they were doing was you had one person on the Game Boy and another person on drums.

1892
02:25:25,690 --> 02:25:27,811
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like a non-stop dance party or what?

1893
02:25:28,471 --> 02:25:29,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.

1894
02:25:29,131 --> 02:25:34,034
[SPEAKER_03]: It turned into like this awesome 8-bit electro rave and...

1895
02:25:36,804 --> 02:25:38,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like a lot of crowd surfing.

1896
02:25:38,545 --> 02:25:39,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just great.

1897
02:25:39,686 --> 02:25:41,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It ran an hour late, but it was well worth it.

1898
02:25:42,307 --> 02:25:45,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my favorite group was on stage, Anamanaguchi.

1899
02:25:45,850 --> 02:25:54,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, their background beats is 8-bit NES, and you have one on drums, a lead, a bassist, and another guitarist.

1900
02:25:54,775 --> 02:25:56,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I just couldn't remember what his part was.

1901
02:25:57,137 --> 02:25:58,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I actually found it.

1902
02:25:59,698 --> 02:26:02,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, somebody in chat says it right, as I find it myself.

1903
02:26:02,220 --> 02:26:05,742
[SPEAKER_07]: But his name was Paul Owens, and he's the director of the movie Reformat the Planet.

1904
02:26:06,647 --> 02:26:08,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, that artist wasn't there.

1905
02:26:08,588 --> 02:26:10,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but that's, anyway, sorry.

1906
02:26:11,009 --> 02:26:14,391
[SPEAKER_07]: When you said chiptunes, I just remember that particular performance was pretty awesome.

1907
02:26:15,271 --> 02:26:16,172
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know what you're talking about.

1908
02:26:16,632 --> 02:26:20,554
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of a big part of how 8-Bit Weapon kind of got their sound.

1909
02:26:21,554 --> 02:26:22,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

1910
02:26:22,075 --> 02:26:22,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I love 8-Bit Weapon.

1911
02:26:23,675 --> 02:26:24,496
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's cool.

1912
02:26:24,936 --> 02:26:26,577
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny that this stuff's gotten bigger and bigger.

1913
02:26:28,029 --> 02:26:31,912
[SPEAKER_03]: StarScream, Syphus, Nordloaf, and Anamanaguchi How much did this whole thing cost you?

1914
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:51,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it was $15.

1915
02:26:52,021 --> 02:26:54,082
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a four-night event.

1916
02:26:54,583 --> 02:26:56,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $50 for all four nights.

1917
02:26:56,564 --> 02:27:00,406
[SPEAKER_03]: If you paid $60, you get a DVD of Blitz Festival 06.

1918
02:27:01,387 --> 02:27:02,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went for Sunday.

1919
02:27:02,607 --> 02:27:06,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I just picked up the 07 DVD, and I will tell you this.

1920
02:27:06,810 --> 02:27:15,175
[SPEAKER_03]: The way they remixed the music on that DVD, even if you have the volume almost near where no one can still hear it, it's still loud, and it's really good.

1921
02:27:15,195 --> 02:27:16,336
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1922
02:27:16,356 --> 02:27:17,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it sounds like you had fun.

1923
02:27:17,777 --> 02:27:19,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish our phone lines had been open last week.

1924
02:27:20,635 --> 02:27:21,195
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1925
02:27:50,575 --> 02:27:53,297
[SPEAKER_07]: The Force is not strong with him, but, you know, a little bit.

1926
02:27:54,058 --> 02:27:54,318
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1927
02:27:55,399 --> 02:27:58,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm staring at that screen, and happy fangirl.

1928
02:27:58,642 --> 02:27:59,562
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to it after the show.

1929
02:27:59,762 --> 02:28:02,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, we've got Tatsunoko vs. Capcom up on the screen now, finally.

1930
02:28:02,385 --> 02:28:03,165
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get to it soon.

1931
02:28:03,666 --> 02:28:05,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma, we've got to let you go, though, so we can get one more call.

1932
02:28:06,088 --> 02:28:06,288
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1933
02:28:06,368 --> 02:28:07,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I say one more thing, and then I can get out of here?

1934
02:28:07,869 --> 02:28:08,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

1935
02:28:09,650 --> 02:28:11,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, that song, it's Pitch Black.

1936
02:28:11,712 --> 02:28:15,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It's off the MC Frontline album, Secrets from the Future, so you know which one it is.

1937
02:28:15,195 --> 02:28:16,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1938
02:28:16,356 --> 02:28:16,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1939
02:28:17,028 --> 02:28:17,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1940
02:28:17,528 --> 02:28:17,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1941
02:28:18,349 --> 02:28:18,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

1942
02:28:19,009 --> 02:28:19,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1943
02:28:19,650 --> 02:28:23,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, did you get a chance to check out the new album?

1944
02:28:24,853 --> 02:28:27,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's in my roommate's car, but I'll have to check it out soon.

1945
02:28:27,435 --> 02:28:28,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much worth it.

1946
02:28:29,016 --> 02:28:29,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

1947
02:28:29,817 --> 02:28:30,117
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1948
02:28:30,517 --> 02:28:30,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, Ranma.

1949
02:28:31,638 --> 02:28:31,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1950
02:28:32,899 --> 02:28:33,699
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take one more call.

1951
02:28:33,719 --> 02:28:38,403
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call right now.

1952
02:28:40,544 --> 02:28:41,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other last-minute stories?

1953
02:28:41,445 --> 02:28:41,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we get them all?

1954
02:28:42,156 --> 02:28:42,957
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we didn't.

1955
02:28:43,057 --> 02:28:43,578
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, go ahead.

1956
02:28:44,639 --> 02:28:45,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It's music news stuff.

1957
02:28:45,820 --> 02:28:48,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Pearl Jam's 10 album is coming to Rock Band in March.

1958
02:28:49,223 --> 02:28:52,927
[SPEAKER_05]: That was announced at the Spike VGA.

1959
02:28:53,047 --> 02:28:53,387
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1960
02:29:02,281 --> 02:29:03,782
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like a ripper.

1961
02:29:32,509 --> 02:29:33,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Akadepro, what's on your mind?

1962
02:29:35,210 --> 02:29:36,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm, uh, well, what is it?

1963
02:29:36,970 --> 02:29:43,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm, well, as you haven't heard, I'm back in WoW, playing on the US server once again, actually.

1964
02:29:44,052 --> 02:29:44,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

1965
02:29:47,113 --> 02:29:56,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, uh, well, I thought you were going to go off to this, that you can now change your, uh,

1966
02:29:58,547 --> 02:29:59,228
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1967
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:17,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Troll Warlock

1968
02:30:41,567 --> 02:30:43,268
[SPEAKER_07]: The interesting... Oh, whatever.

1969
02:30:44,348 --> 02:30:47,989
[SPEAKER_07]: The interesting thing is, is that, um... I don't play a warlock, obviously.

1970
02:30:48,210 --> 02:30:51,451
[SPEAKER_07]: The other interesting thing is, is that you can change the gender of your character.

1971
02:30:51,471 --> 02:30:53,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can now give your character a sex change!

1972
02:30:54,772 --> 02:30:55,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Whee!

1973
02:30:55,172 --> 02:30:55,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1974
02:30:56,033 --> 02:31:10,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And, well, here's the other thing, is that, well, as one sort of... Well, I don't know if you're supposed to be... But as one cross-dresser sort of like, since I'm not considering myself fully bone-training...

1975
02:31:11,470 --> 02:31:14,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, but that doesn't matter.

1976
02:31:14,472 --> 02:31:17,273
[SPEAKER_07]: We already play as girls already.

1977
02:31:18,974 --> 02:31:23,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I play as a tauren female because who plays a tauren female?

1978
02:31:23,296 --> 02:31:25,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you, nobody plays a tauren female.

1979
02:31:25,537 --> 02:31:25,857
[SPEAKER_02]: You do.

1980
02:31:25,877 --> 02:31:26,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, me.

1981
02:31:26,978 --> 02:31:28,979
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's probably like five on the entire server.

1982
02:31:28,999 --> 02:31:30,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this Sassy Pants?

1983
02:31:30,119 --> 02:31:30,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1984
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:33,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually don't give out the character name on the server.

1985
02:31:33,341 --> 02:31:34,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, that's fine.

1986
02:31:35,802 --> 02:31:36,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want random tells.

1987
02:31:37,023 --> 02:31:38,083
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they can probably find it.

1988
02:31:38,123 --> 02:31:38,423
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all right.

1989
02:31:38,443 --> 02:31:38,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

1990
02:31:39,104 --> 02:31:39,344
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.

1991
02:31:40,914 --> 02:31:44,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't need the random emails of people saying, I looked up a character in the armory and she sucks.

1992
02:31:45,518 --> 02:31:48,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that would tell me exactly what they could do.

1993
02:31:49,941 --> 02:31:50,662
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, sorry.

1994
02:31:51,442 --> 02:31:53,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the process of leveling up.

1995
02:31:53,864 --> 02:31:57,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of warlocks, they work warlock.

1996
02:31:58,047 --> 02:31:58,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to level 30.

1997
02:31:59,048 --> 02:32:06,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It's damn nice that you get your mount at level 30 nowadays.

1998
02:32:07,669 --> 02:32:08,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's amazing.

1999
02:32:08,249 --> 02:32:10,070
[SPEAKER_07]: They've made a lot of great changes.

2000
02:32:10,190 --> 02:32:12,791
[SPEAKER_07]: One change I really like that they did is that now you have the heirlooms.

2001
02:32:13,571 --> 02:32:19,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have a level 80 character and if you save up your badges or wintergrass marks, you can buy these heirlooms and you can send them.

2002
02:32:19,953 --> 02:32:26,175
[SPEAKER_07]: They're bind to account, meaning you can send these items to any player on your account and they actually scale in level.

2003
02:32:26,635 --> 02:32:36,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's cool is that the shoulders heirlooms that you can buy scale in level so you can send them to your level 1 character and they get a 10% experience bonus gain in addition to the pretty awesome stats.

2004
02:32:37,239 --> 02:32:41,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So, kind of neat.

2005
02:32:42,681 --> 02:32:43,582
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems quite nice.

2006
02:32:44,022 --> 02:32:49,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, other than that, I have nothing to remark about.

2007
02:32:49,884 --> 02:32:53,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I should point out, check out Left 4 Dead.

2008
02:32:53,646 --> 02:32:55,106
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice.

2009
02:32:57,127 --> 02:32:57,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is this?

2010
02:32:57,607 --> 02:32:58,007
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this?

2011
02:32:58,928 --> 02:32:59,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Left 4 Dead.

2012
02:33:00,228 --> 02:33:00,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Left 4 Dead.

2013
02:33:01,189 --> 02:33:01,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

2014
02:33:02,775 --> 02:33:12,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I play, when the demo was released, I got up to play it, but it really is something.

2015
02:33:13,063 --> 02:33:26,674
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing you have to point out is that you really do need four people and all of them need to have mics, else there really isn't any fun.

2016
02:33:28,564 --> 02:33:28,904
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2017
02:33:28,944 --> 02:33:35,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I got to let you go because the chat wants less Warcraft and more Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

2018
02:33:35,207 --> 02:33:36,647
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to wrap up the show.

2019
02:33:36,907 --> 02:33:38,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that too.

2020
02:33:39,248 --> 02:33:39,549
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2021
02:33:39,669 --> 02:33:40,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, take care, buddy.

2022
02:33:41,329 --> 02:33:41,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, same.

2023
02:33:41,949 --> 02:33:42,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the call.

2024
02:33:43,390 --> 02:33:45,411
[SPEAKER_07]: We enjoy hearing from our listeners from afar.

2025
02:33:45,865 --> 02:33:48,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have commentary about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

2026
02:33:48,806 --> 02:33:49,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Which would be?

2027
02:33:50,067 --> 02:33:53,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the music that they've put up for the characters.

2028
02:33:53,989 --> 02:33:58,070
[SPEAKER_02]: That for Ken, they give him the... Okay, gotcha my history.

2029
02:33:58,090 --> 02:34:01,792
[SPEAKER_02]: For the first 13 episodes of the series, it had a more sedate opening.

2030
02:34:02,392 --> 02:34:05,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And the da-de-da thing that everyone knows was the closing theme.

2031
02:34:05,654 --> 02:34:08,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they switched it over because all the fans liked the big one better.

2032
02:34:08,955 --> 02:34:13,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ken gets that theme, but June gets the original opening, which I thought was pretty funny.

2033
02:34:14,178 --> 02:34:19,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it for me being a total Tatsunoko fangirl nerd.

2034
02:34:21,265 --> 02:34:26,430
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan laughed at me because I was singing along with it while I was playing the other day.

2035
02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:29,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I was.

2036
02:34:29,490 --> 02:34:31,351
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2037
02:34:32,191 --> 02:34:35,113
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up tonight's show.

2038
02:34:35,153 --> 02:34:36,093
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at the end of the show.

2039
02:34:37,073 --> 02:34:37,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2040
02:34:37,553 --> 02:34:38,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get it.

2041
02:34:38,454 --> 02:34:38,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2042
02:34:38,674 --> 02:34:38,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2043
02:34:38,914 --> 02:34:39,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Last minute story.

2044
02:34:39,474 --> 02:34:39,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2045
02:34:39,674 --> 02:34:40,395
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's all right.

2046
02:34:40,415 --> 02:34:40,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2047
02:34:41,555 --> 02:34:43,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to Guitar Hero Metallica.

2048
02:34:43,196 --> 02:34:45,356
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a partial track list out from it now.

2049
02:34:46,197 --> 02:34:50,999
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of the Metallica songs, there's going to be some songs from other bands that worked with Metallica and stuff like that.

2050
02:34:51,459 --> 02:34:57,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Turn the Page, Judas Priest, Hellbent for Leather, and

[SPEAKER_05]: Cyrus with Demon Cleaner, Leonard Skinner with Tuesday's Gone, Mastodon, Blood and Thunder, Michael Sheckler Group, Armed and Ready, Sam Hain, Mother of Mercy, and The Sword, Black River.

2052
02:35:16,765 --> 02:35:21,706
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also apparently some unannounced tracks by Slayer, Queen, and The Foo Fighters.

2053
02:35:23,047 --> 02:35:26,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess this is all coming from the new Game Informer.

2054
02:35:26,730 --> 02:35:28,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have some info on that.

2055
02:35:28,531 --> 02:35:30,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the Metallica tracks in there.

2056
02:35:30,513 --> 02:35:44,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Enter Sandman, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Fuel, Hit the Lights, King Nothin', Master Puppets, and No Leaf Clovers, Nothing Else Matters, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, and Where I May Roam.

2057
02:35:45,966 --> 02:35:46,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds kind of cool.

2058
02:35:47,443 --> 02:36:08,693
[SPEAKER_05]: and, um, let's see, some other stuff, download content coming to LittleBigPlanet, including a Santa costume you can get now, it'll be available free on, um, December 18th, and they're gonna have it in two parts, so you can make, uh, your Santa sack boys, and, um...

2059
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:10,140
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, WhiteShadow

2060
02:36:39,810 --> 02:36:41,811
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you know Gatchaman.

2061
02:36:42,191 --> 02:36:42,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't.

2062
02:36:43,991 --> 02:36:47,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I forgot the whole stupid speech, so whatever.

2063
02:36:49,173 --> 02:36:50,613
[SPEAKER_02]: More Gatchaman, less WoW.

2064
02:36:51,693 --> 02:36:53,494
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is WoW.

2065
02:36:53,754 --> 02:36:59,416
[SPEAKER_07]: No, WoW I love my new, I have a Tanooki suit hoodie that I have now that's awesome.

2066
02:36:59,456 --> 02:37:04,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I wore it out last night and I got compliments on it, but the best part about it on the actual hoodie is little cat ears.

2067
02:37:05,197 --> 02:37:07,698
[SPEAKER_07]: So you actually look like, I'll go out and get it.

2068
02:37:08,306 --> 02:37:09,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, never mind.

2069
02:37:09,467 --> 02:37:12,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't have it out right now, but... I need to find one.

2070
02:37:12,090 --> 02:37:16,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll wear it out sometime when we go out to not go to the test location of DJ Max Technica.

2071
02:37:17,436 --> 02:37:21,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, you're like, I gotta go shopping, blah, blah, blah.

2072
02:37:21,060 --> 02:37:22,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get some shoes.

2073
02:37:22,382 --> 02:37:23,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get some shoes.

2074
02:37:23,343 --> 02:37:24,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought.

2075
02:37:25,305 --> 02:37:27,027
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I gotta find Cageman's song.

2076
02:37:27,714 --> 02:37:28,254
[SPEAKER_05]: You better hurry.

2077
02:37:28,775 --> 02:37:29,035
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2078
02:37:29,275 --> 02:37:32,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to and supporting independent podcasting.

2079
02:37:32,417 --> 02:37:35,619
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are awesome, and thanks so, so, so much for your support.

2080
02:37:35,659 --> 02:37:37,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Without you guys, we just wouldn't be here.

2081
02:37:37,821 --> 02:37:39,882
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have any major TV thing.

2082
02:37:40,583 --> 02:37:42,644
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't get acknowledged to the Video Game Awards.

2083
02:37:42,684 --> 02:37:44,785
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have tons of people listening to us.

2084
02:37:45,106 --> 02:37:46,366
[SPEAKER_07]: So just help us spread the word.

2085
02:37:46,427 --> 02:37:50,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave a nice review on iTunes or some other website that ranks podcasts.

2086
02:37:51,090 --> 02:37:52,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell your friends about the show.

[SPEAKER_07]: That's all we ask.

2088
02:37:53,151 --> 02:37:53,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Commercial free.

2089
02:37:54,372 --> 02:37:57,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sometimes the podcasts are slow to upload, but you know what?

2090
02:37:57,054 --> 02:37:57,434
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free.
