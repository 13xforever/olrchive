Dream a dream lover, take me in a dream Take me any way you please, boy you're making me scream
Dream a dream lover, life is just a dream If you wanna set me free, boy you're making me scream
Ooh la da dee, la da da You gotta dream a dream
Wow, so this entire time the microphones have been silenced, cause I'm a moron
Everybody probably left, no the entire time those mics have been silenced, whoops
Hurry up
Okay, anyway, if you're still with us, which I hope you are, I wanna give a quick update for the O-L-R-U-S-L
This is really under sedations thing, we don't really do anything but make fun of it
Top 25 games ever, or the March Madness, or if you wanna say like January Madness, I don't know what you wanna call it
Madness!
This is Madness! Alright, anyhow, this is the Top 25, let me get my theme music again
As it stands today, this is the Top 25 list of games of all time
25 Super GT, 24 Mega Man 9, this is based on your votes, 23 Time Crisis, 22 Bionic Commando Rearmed, 21 Gradius, 20 Ace Attorney, 19 Daytona USA, 18 Beatmania 2DX, 17 Street Fighter 2, 16 La Mulana
You know that was Dark Tetsuya, 15 Para Para Paradise, 14 Final Fantasy 5, 13 Final Fantasy 7, 12 Castlevania Symphony of the Night, 11 Pop'n Music, 10 Super Mario 3, 9 Tetris Attack, 8 Rock Band, 7 Tetris, 6 DDR, 5 Final Fantasy 6, 4 Super Metroid, 3 A Link to the Past, 2 Ocarina of Time, 1 Chrono Trigger
Now, if you think that this list is bullshit, which is apparently Dark Sakura does, you should send in your list of the Top 25 games ever to uslmadness at gmail.com
Madness!
Send in your list and you can rectify this terrible list if you need to
Rectify
Rectify, alright, I'm just kidding, it's actually not that bad so far, just these little tinkering, these little tinkering needs some older games in there
Needs a good potty
But I haven't sent my list yet, so
They need to take Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid off because those games suck
Those games both suck, both games really bad
Like your mom
Alright
Anyhow, uhh
They need to put more Wii Music on there
Yes, I'm getting to the fortune music, I gotta load it
Thank you guys for staying with us up on this very late hour
Here on Orange Laundry throughout all our technical difficulties and all that stuff
Shut up
Hey Rob, br br br br br br br br
Do you wanna introduce the cookie tonight?
Cookie!
My favorite Christmas memory, when I was growing up, was the uhh
Oh god bless you little pixies
Was the Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas song
By the way, this, we can't pay for the rights for this, this will not make it on the album
So you'll be able to go, oh, I heard bits that aren't even on the fucking CD, man
It's a fucking cool line, they had to cut that thing out
When I was growing up, my favorite Christmas memory was the Alvin and the Chipmunks album
Because we had it on LP
And you know what I'm talking about, the uhh
Remember that song? Little Chipmunks are singing and there's that guy Dave going
Alright now Chipmunks, let's all br br br
My brother and I had that on an LP, so what we would do is
We would play that as slow, on the slowest beat possible on the record player
So then, it sounded like four normal monotone guys
Just singing this boring Christmas song
And then this demon from like the ninth level of traitors and murderers just screaming at them
And then it just, it was just so different, it was like
Christmas, Christmas, time is here
Time for toys, and time for cheer
okay
He adores you
Okay
How many years have I used to live?
How many?
NO!
Okay
That actually was kind of funny
I loathed
Bye
Bye guys
