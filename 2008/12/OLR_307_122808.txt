I, December 28, 2008, Capulorasa goes free, Konami files another music game lawsuit, and we look back at the highlights.
Merry Christmas, everybody!
It's too late for that.
Oh, whoops.
Well, just a preemptive one for 2009.
Hey, you're listening to... It's still Kwanzaa!
That's true.
Merry Kwanzaa, everybody!
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
And we are here live here on All Games Radio on this lovely December the 28th.
2008, talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts.
Joining us as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
I'm sad, Rob.
Why are you sad?
It's the last show of the year.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
We were just kind of chilling and it kept going and going.
So we were like, oh, let's take a cat nap.
I fell into a Indian food coma.
But then our chat room was getting restless.
As they might say overseas, rude.
A little bit rude.
Better rude than Randy What about Loki?
I don't want to talk to you anyways.
I'm sure he'd make his presence known at some point anyway.
I haven't gone into the gaming weeks yet.
If I'd gone into gaming weeks and still forgot Loki, then you could yell at me.
Rob, don't you know that the first rule of parenting is maintain a schedule and an order?
Am I your daddy?
Oh, baby.
Also say hello to the one and only Arcadian42 is joining us tonight.
Straight from the ultra-sensitive mics.
Yes, the ultra-sensitive mic.
I just wanted to come and bother you for a show.
No, please do.
You know, it was funny.
I had a bunch of people sending me private messages before the show began tonight.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We've decided, though, what your special power is.
It's the ability to show up at any party and still be there.
Playing pinball.
Just sit in the corner and use... Is that... Don't notice me until... No, it's like... Oh, he's over there.
No, it's like... And we have no problem with this.
We just think it's funny.
Dan and I were talking about last time you were at one of our parties.
and we were just wandering around the house and people were starting to head off and nothing's going on in the garage, at least so we think.
We go into the garage and there he is playing.
You're turning the light out and you hear this voice.
It was about to.
And all of a sudden I hear like sound effects from, oh God, what machines do we have in there right now?
Indiana Jones?
No, we were fixing that one.
But it was just hearing sound effects.
I was like, what the crap?
Oh, hi.
Hi.
I have nowhere to go.
Okay, TinyRob.
Alright, let's go to... Hey, it's not the size, it's how you use it.
Let's get into your gaming week.
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
Semi-eventful.
I played stuff.
I started Ragnarok Online DS.
And I was like, ooh, Ragnarok!
Talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking.
Wow, I read like a Japanese five-year-old.
Talking and talking and talking and talking and talking.
Finally, action!
We're gonna fall off a cliff!
Shit, we landed on this guy!
Let's talk to him!
Talk to me!
So, I forgot his name, but like, I was like, text in blue, I can read it!
And it was named one of the towns.
I was like, okay, good.
All the towns are gonna be written in katakana, and I can read that shit!
I know where to go!
So, and it was, it actually, when it goes through big dialogue scenes, it has you saved periodically.
So, I've saved, and I've done my stats too.
So, I at least remember that all my stats are in the same place, because I recognize the kanji for strength.
And so I was like, well, strength is always the first one.
So maybe the next one is agility, and the next one is intelligence, and blah, blah, blah, blah.
So...
Simon's Quest
What a horrible night for a curse.
And so, so anyway, so anyway, I also, I went with my friend Becky and we got her husband an Xbox 360, well she did that technically.
She got the family their Christmas present of an Xbox 360 and she gave him a Big Fat Gift Certificate to GameStop.
And I was like, well, if you were going to actually pick out games for him, you should get him Fallout 3 and Fable 2 and the Orange Box.
So guess what he picked up with his gift certificate?
All of them.
Yes.
Awesome.
Oh, hell yeah.
So anyway, so it was funny.
So I actually got to see some of Fallout 3, and I thought it was pretty cool.
I didn't play any, because those games make me freaking nauseated as hell.
Did you get to hit the button that makes the baby talk?
Like, that's the one thing.
I haven't really played Fallout 3 yet, but I was listening to Bobby talk about it on the last show, when they were talking about the, I don't remember what it was, but he was talking about slamming on the button that makes the baby talk, and I'm like, wow, that sounds kind of awesome.
That could be the best game ever.
He was already past it.
Oh, okay.
And I played some Animal Crossing so that I could harass Jingle, who I think is on crack.
Oh shit, I forgot about holidays in Animal Crossing.
Because he has the starry eyes, and I think that it really means that Jingle is on crack so he won't sleep at all that night.
So it's like, here's your presents, kids!
And I downloaded something on my phone.
What's that?
Well, two things.
First of all was the 8,000 cocktail drink mixing guide for free.
Hey, we're having our New Year's party at Julie's house and I need to be drunk because it's Julie's house.
Sorry.
No offense to Julie if you listen.
Intoxicated enough to actually sing karaoke.
I see.
We will have special guests.
who will be here for this party, namely Sauce.
Oh, is she coming to town?
No, she's actually going to teleport in and show up just for five seconds that night and leave.
Yes, she's coming.
All right, I think I'll see you at Gaming Week before I smack you.
I did play other stuff.
I played Riding Rock Online.
The real thing.
The real one.
The real one for free.
And someone gave me a mistress card for Christmas and I was like, ooh, mistress card.
Is that like a business card?
No, Mistress is the stupid bee that I hate.
She's one of the MVP things and then you get a card that makes you not have to use gems to cast stuff which is helpful and useful.
Only I forgot to put it in something.
So I got that and I played with the City of Heroes character creator a lot.
The Korean one.
Here's the best part of the game.
That's why I have the Korean character creators.
I don't have the whole game yet.
But I'm thinking about playing it.
I'm thinking about playing it.
Because I was really thinking about it.
I was like, dude, why would I even remotely want to play World of Warcraft again?
Because I was just like looking at different stuff.
I was like, dude, I don't want to play it anymore.
So I'm kind of waffling again.
So that's really it for my gaming week.
Let me read some chat comments.
You can always join our chat room, chat.orangelongeradio.com, and we always like to read your comments throughout the program.
GS68 comments on both you and I have said things about the level of difficulty in the Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game, and I don't know if it's just because we suck at games now that we've gotten older or the game really is kind of a step harder, but GS68's thought is at least Ecclesia is think on your feet hard, not stupid hard like Circle of the Moon.
Yeah, well, this is what I've noticed is I've actually got pretty good reaction time through the forest.
It's just I sped through the first level.
I really just sped through it.
And I think that
I would probably do better with about another level's worth of life, and then I can get through it.
Because it's like this one place that I always end up getting smacked around at.
Since you didn't get your time, gaining experience points, so... So I'm going to go back and... And we have an offer from Xenocor in chat, who's on the Justice server in City of Heroes, if you ever need help.
Well, thank you kindly, sir.
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was okay.
I played...
More this idea of the new Final Fantasy, I don't even know if you want to call it a fighting game.
To me, it's very similar to Crisis Core a bit.
Because Crisis Core, if you've ever played it, is...
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And it's okay, I guess.
I was kind of bored with it.
I tried making a character look like myself, and then that didn't work.
So the next best thing was I made a creepy Santa Claus.
And I had to, you know, first I was just trying to find clothes that looked like the Santa Claus clothes, and then I realized that they actually sold the Santa Claus clothes, so I had to buy those.
Wait, wait, wait, stop, hold on.
You bought something at home?
Yeah.
Get off the show.
I am laughing you off of this program you spent money on that
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And the thing about it is, I had knocked the PlayStation Network before because I hated the way you put money on your account and you have to spend so much.
Actually, I found out, if you are buying items that are under $5, then yes, you can only put in the minimum of $5 on your account.
If you're purchasing stuff over $5 in total, what will happen is, say if you have like
I played around with Home for a little bit and it was a complete waste of time.
I don't get
What the purpose of all this is.
But at least you look like Santa Claus.
So hooray for that.
Yes, at least I look like Santa Claus.
And, you know, big deal.
But I'm going to still wear the Santa Claus costume forever.
You know, I'm not buying any more clothes.
That's it.
I'm Santa Claus forever now.
Even in June.
Even in June.
That's fine.
So, yeah, it was quite boring.
And the loading is annoying.
I've got to say some comments from chat because they're too good.
Hanukkah Harry in chat says, What the fuck, Loki?
You might as well buy Eye of Judgment.
No, I'm not buying that.
I have judgment.
Trishlicious in chat says, I wish I had a PlayStation 3, then I could be exploring home now.
Honestly, Trish, I used to feel that same way like six months ago.
You're not missing much, honestly.
It's still in beta.
It's early.
I think home's going to be a lot better in a year, but that'll be a year.
I do have to give them credit, though.
The video integration in it, like the actual little video screens and stuff, that's actually pretty cool, and it's pretty seamless.
Yeah.
But at the same time, it's kind of annoying.
And it's also annoying how much stuff is being censored in there.
Like, everything's being censored, and it's really annoying.
Okay, so enough with home.
The other thing I downloaded on the PlayStation Network this week was the new Metal Gear Solid pack for LittleBigPlanet.
And holy crap, does that change the game.
It really, first of all, the pack itself contains like five levels, and I think a challenge level.
And they're great levels.
I mean, it's the same kind of quality as the in-game story levels, and they're awesome.
I like it, though, because the whole premise of the levels is that you're...
basically going to try to stop Liquid's device for creating trophy levels.
It's a machine that creates trophy levels.
Genius.
Pure genius.
I love the way that Media Molecule played on some of the current controversies.
The only thing that would have been even better was a joke about moderation.
Somehow.
But I love that they actually made fun of the whole trophy whoring levels.
That was great.
But the actual new weapon, like the Paininator in it,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and unless they hit a roadblock of something that they really want to add that they can't do in LittleBigPlanet, then they'll do a LittleBigPlanet 2.
But for right now, they're just going to keep doing download packs because they're selling really well.
So that's kind of cool.
Now just to clarify though, you don't have to buy this Metal Gear Solid add-on to get to use the Paintinator because it'll show up in other people's levels, right?
Yes, that's right.
That's kind of neat.
Thanks for watching!
I was playing some more of the levels on there.
They're really cool.
The paint there is fun.
Someone actually made a level that was like a tank that had three different weapons and stuff on there.
That was kind of neat.
Some of the stuff that they do in the Metal Gear Solid levels are just amazing.
They actually have one level that you have to sneak and avoid these spotlights because if not, then you die because all these explosions come.
The last boss in the game...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Arcadian42, Bradley Surd, the chatty one tonight.
I saw you haul a DS in here and you were kind of playing DS while we had a little bit of downtime a little bit ago.
What kind of games have you been playing this week?
Most of this week I was not playing anything because I was at home on the other coast doing Christmas stuff.
But what I've been playing recently is My Japanese Coach.
Wait, where is home?
Because we might have some listeners there that want to go, Woo!
Greenville, South Carolina.
Woo!
Alright.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
and they were going back to England for a week for someone's funeral or something.
It was kind of fun to listen to them.
Sorry, I don't mean to laugh, but I'm just trying to picture what must have been so fascinating about this conversation.
Never mind.
Another show.
My Japanese coach.
I'm basically reviewing what I've learned before for the most part and learning a little bit enough to get through that.
and it's actually pretty good for learning new stuff and I think there's maybe the only limitation if you're like a newer user would be or a newer person learning Japanese would be that it kind of glosses a little bit over the learning sentences and so on but it's good on like repetition of words and so on which is if you're just reviewing the first like the first 30 or 40 lessons it's
It's a little bit tedious because it takes a while because you have to repeat games and stuff to get to the next lesson.
Do you actually have to talk into it?
No, you don't have to talk.
There is a thing you can actually compare.
You can speak into the mic and then you don't repeat it back and you can kind of compare it to the actual Japanese speaker that's in the game.
so that you can learn that stuff.
That sounds neat.
Do you think somebody like me who doesn't know a lick of Japanese yet tries to pronounce the Japanese release dates here on Orange Lodge Radio and gets teased for it every other week, do you think I might have some benefit to play this game?
Yeah, it would be pretty good.
I might have to check it out.
Yeah, and then you can learn the Hiragana and Katakana and
And of course, it takes a long time.
The economy is not until like less than 40 or something.
Although Jamie did admit a few weeks ago, I've gotten better in the years I've been doing it.
Your past got quite a bit better.
I've gotten better.
So when in doubt, crash and burn your way through it.
Arigato.
Yeah, because basically when I've been listening to the podcast, trying to catch up, which I'm still like 30 behind.
I'm actually thinking about getting that though.
Oh man, come on, you could say that better.
With the Japanese coach?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have a couple of friends that live in Japan that I want to visit, but I also have people I know in England that I want to visit, so I have to think.
See, if I really wanted to learn Japanese, what I would do is get Jamie a device.
I am not a scroll!
Where every time I mispronounce a word, she shocks me.
But the problem is that she would use that device for things other than its intended purpose, so I don't allow her to have this device.
Hanukkah Harry said I was a scroll.
I'm not a Skrull!
Let Bradley finish his gaming week.
Okay, I'll go a little bit farther than this week, because other than this, it's been a while since I've been here.
The other things I've been playing is Castlevania Lament of Innocence, which, even though I heard people saying it was bad or something, it's actually a pretty good game.
Other than the camera issues, which you can't see half the time, because it's looking in the other direction from the actual degree of movement, it's actually pretty enjoyable, and
The voice acting is really good.
And the other thing was Zelda Phantom Hourglass, which I still got a ways to go in.
That's a fun game.
All right.
I'm reading some other comments in the chat room.
Akuma JP says, commenting on my reading of the Japanese release dates, Skye sometimes get very good when he is in a good mood, but no idea when he is not in the mood.
So apparently if I'm in a good mood, I'll do better at reading the release dates.
So I'll try to smile before I read the dates tonight so I'm in a good mood, although I don't think we have a lot this week.
My gaming week, real quickly, because pretty much everything I wanted to talk about has already been talked about.
I've been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King, as you know, I'm addicted to MMOs.
But I would like to congratulate our guild for clearing Naxx.
That was pretty awesome, which is one of the big raids at the end.
We cleared 10-man Naxx this week, which is nice.
And the other thing I've been playing is...
The Metal Gear Solid expansion on the little big planet, which is amazing, and everybody should buy it.
Because not only does it come with the whole gun and things you can put in your own levels, I don't even design levels, but I just kind of wanted to see.
My thought was that probably Media Molecule designed some levels to unlock this stuff in, because I heard that you actually had to play these levels to unlock the stuff.
So you're basically getting, you know what, five or so new Media Molecule levels, and they are great.
and I realized I could go online and download a ton of other levels but there's something about having the official developer with official unlocks being able to play those levels and they are fantastic something Loki kind of neglected to mention is that not only can you run through them once but you can go back and you can play through these same levels again with new challenge elements on them you'll get stickers at the very end that you can go back and place at the very beginning and then suddenly the entire level becomes a race which makes some of those things like the stealth level and stuff become very interesting because you're trying to rush but not too much
I've actually gotten most of the trophies for the entire thing.
In fact, I think I have all the trophies except for the one beating the last boss under a certain time limit, but I have all the other trophies.
I don't think I've unlocked a single trophy yet, sadly.
I've aced all the levels.
I've gotten every single bit of collectible stuff in the game, or at least in those levels.
I'm missing like two stickers in one level that is bugging the hell out of me because I can't figure out where they are.
I know what you're talking about, the third level.
Yes, it is.
How do you know?
Where are they?
You tell me now.
All right, I'll tell you now.
You know that spot where you have to shoot the green thing so the platform's lower down?
Yeah.
Yeah, on the second one that lowers down, you walk through to the left, and there's a hallway that you can walk through.
Oh, shut up.
Really?
Yeah, it took me forever to figure that out.
That is so crazy.
I didn't even have to tell you what it is.
It's frustrating me, and I know exactly what you're talking about.
I'm like, nope, I haven't been there.
You're right.
That's what I'm missing.
Yeah, because I had to read the comments for the actual level, and there was questions about that in there, and that's where they said it was.
I was like, ah, because I knew just plain level.
I'm like, there's something down there.
I just don't know how to get down there.
The network was down the day I was trying to play, so I couldn't do that.
Interesting.
But I gotta say, honestly, if you have LittleBigPlanet, check out the expansion.
You won't be disappointed.
Even if you don't build levels, I think the five or so levels that come with it are... It's six bucks.
It's worth it.
It really is.
Okay, let's move on with tonight's show and try to get into some gaming news.
But first, some housekeeping tonight.
First off, we want to make sure everybody had a really wonderful holiday.
And just a quick reminder, although we didn't take off any shows for the holiday, we will not be here January...
January 11th, I believe is the day.
Yeah, January 11th, we will not be here.
So no yelling at Bobby if he goes long.
January 11th.
He can go till midnight if he wants.
I don't really care.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So I know what all the Toda KK songs are called now.
And he got me these Kingdom Hearts promo cards that they had at his store.
I kind of wanted them, so he grabbed me some.
And I got the Silent Hill Homecoming soundtrack, which a lucky person is going to be receiving a copy as well, but I won't say anything more than that.
Ooh.
Ooh.
and Candy.
and I got a coat.
I have a funny story about my coat.
You remember the coat I was wearing last week?
Yes, I do.
Well, Becky and I were going shopping.
Did someone knock on the door?
No.
No.
We were going shopping and we saw these coats at this one retailer who I will not mention and we thought they were cute so we went in and it was marked down from $89 to $39 and they would buy one and get one half price.
So we just gifted each other coats and they were really cool.
Thanks for watching!
Aw, Loki.
You're the best.
Hey, no problem.
All right.
One other thing.
Oh, yeah?
I got Knights on Wii.
Oh, how's that?
Haven't opened it yet.
I didn't get any, like, games or anything, but Ranma did send me this shirt that says Companion Cube is my co-pilot, so thank you very much to Ranma who sent me that shirt, which I think is great.
It's very cute.
My shirt says, No, you cannot have...
and I'm being very scummy because I wore it yesterday too.
I'm doing that really gross thing where I wore the same shirt two days in a row because I was lazy today.
I didn't really leave the house, so whatevs.
Come on, you've all been there too.
Admit it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But it all starts January 9th, and they are taping live at a computer arena in Atlanta.
And there's going to be other people on, and they're going to actually dissect game consoles and repair them live on air.
And it's actually kind of a multimedia thing.
It's not just a radio.
They're doing TV, too.
So it sounds pretty exciting.
I just sent them my broken 360.
Good luck fixing that one.
I think you have to take a number for that, because I think they already have lined up what they're doing for the first two shows.
No, I don't want it back.
They can just have it?
Maybe they'd take it.
I don't know.
I've talked to Bobby.
FNG Life.net
Yeah, unfortunately, it's not for our region, though.
But, you know, Japan... What happens in Japan might happen here, right?
Yeah, not so much, I don't think.
Basically, you know, Japan, they do a lot of things over there, especially with their WiiWare service and Nintendo and that kind of stuff, that we will probably never see over here.
For example, you know, they got, a while back, a...
I don't know if it was a couple WiiWare downloads, but they have a new manga comics that you can actually download on the service, which is kind of neat.
Plus, they had their Nintendo channel for a while before we did.
Well, they're getting another channel, and it's not too surprising since the other two consoles also have one similar.
It's a new video streaming service that will be available now.
This is actually in conjunction with Densetsu.
Not your typical video download service because they're not going to have movies.
They're not going to really have a lot of TV shows and stuff.
What they're going to have, though, is like... Oh, my God.
Is it what I've always been waiting for?
A porno-on-demand service?
No, it's not a porno-on-demand service.
It's actually going to be some... They're going to have Nintendo videos on there, whatever that's supposed to be.
I don't know if that's like the old Nintendo cartoons, you know, like the old Donkey Kong stuff and...
and so on.
There's that humming that one of the mics is causing.
I don't know which one.
Is it?
Yeah, here.
That's a very naughty microphone.
Sorry, guys.
Live radio.
Hi.
And so, yeah, it's going to be coming early next year.
No prices have been announced yet, but interesting, though, that they're going to be bringing this out.
Maybe this is something that's coming to the U.S.
I don't know how this...
To be honest, if you've ever used the web browser in this, the bandwidth to the Wii seems very, very slow.
So can you imagine actually downloading content with the Wii, like actual videos and stuff?
I think it would take forever.
We kind of need that upgrade that's supposed to get our SD cards, which wasn't that supposed to be out by the end of the year?
No.
Right, that won't be coming out until... You'll probably have to buy a game that'll unlock that or some shit.
Hitstun in chat says, Sky, porno on demand service equals the internet.
Ooh, touche.
But I can't really get that on my TV very easily.
I can use the internet channel or the PS3's internet thingy, I know, but they suck.
They're clunky.
Have you tried using YouTube on the Wii?
It's not that good.
But you can do porno too.
We did that one time, actually.
It was clunky.
Yeah, that was actually last New Year's, wasn't it?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Oh Lord, please let them do a sequel to this video.
Amen.
And pterodactyl porn.
Hey, Food Delivery Channel is coming to Japan as well.
That's right.
If you want to get food delivered to you, you can now do that through your Wii.
It's called the...
Dimei Channel, the food delivery channel.
8,500 different restaurants.
Apparently you are going to be able to browse it by genre.
So like, you know, pizza, bento boxes, sushi, curry, Chinese, whatever.
You apparently can go on here and the restaurants will actually estimate what the delivery time is.
You place the order on the Wii.
It's faxed to the restaurant and then it's kind of like ordering it on the internet.
And I was kind of like, this has got to be bullshit.
But apparently, there's screenshots and everything.
And granted, this stuff can be photoshopped, but I don't know why someone would want to waste that colossal amount of time on a stupid prank on Christmas.
So this looks to be the real deal.
They didn't know that we would report on it.
I guess so.
I don't know, but this looks to be pretty authentic.
And which is strange, because people predicted that this might happen a long time ago.
Well, I suppose people predicted everything.
But yeah, you look at this here, and there's even a screenshot here where somebody can click on Pizza Hut and order pizza.
Interesting.
I don't know.
If they did something like this in the U.S., do you think... Man, Pizza Hut is... Talk about, like, a whore for, like, ordering stuff.
I mean, you know, before they were in, like, EverQuest.
Slash Pizza, yeah.
Now they're in this.
I would love to have a Pizza Hut here with the Japanese menu.
No, seriously, I was seeing one of the people I keep up with lived over there and posted a picture of the order menu.
There's some very funky pizzas.
It's like something out of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or California Pizza Kitchen.
Or John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
No.
Okay.
Um, yeah, the thing is, though, I don't think a channel like that would work here because we're not so, we're so spread out here in the U.S.
Whereas in Japan, there's a lot more kind of, you know what I mean?
Like, I don't think it might work in different cities.
It might work in different, like, it might, they might be able to do that for New York City for, well, I don't even know if you could do it in Los Angeles and make it worth it.
I don't know.
Pizza Hut equals Kaka Hut
Actually, that's probably one of the pizzas you can get in Japan.
You know what, though?
And I'll tell you, their pasta is pretty good.
I actually thought about getting some of that, but the tray of pasta that they give you is huge, and that would just look ridiculous if I'm eating a huge tray of pasta here.
Goodness, we don't have the camera anymore.
We don't have the camera.
You could bring an entire cake.
But still, though, I wouldn't.
You could bring an entire cake and eat it on here.
I don't like that much cake.
I'll just say, Fatty's eating cake again.
Fatty's eating cake.
I don't like cake.
Now, I did want to make a meatball sub, though.
I saw, like, on the Food Network, they had this thing where they were making it over in someone's kitchen, and that's what they decided to make is a meatball sub.
Like, damn, it looks good.
And all of a sudden, you know, I got craving for a meatball sub.
This is the Pizza Hut menu in Japan as of June.
And I want you to tell me if this sounds tasty to you.
There's bacon mushroom, barbecue chicken, carbonara, which is bacon, egg spread, and black pepper.
Without the egg spread, yes.
Cheese and cheese.
Sure.
Sure.
Yes and yes.
Crab and Shrimp Mayo King, which is fried shrimp, fake crab, corn, onion, broccoli, and mayonnaise.
I need the listeners to understand this.
I fucking hate mayonnaise.
Don't you ever give me anything with mayonnaise even remotely near it because mayonnaise will ruin anything for me.
I hate mayonnaise.
I hate, hate, hate mayonnaise.
I hate warm mayonnaise.
Because warm mayonnaise, like mayonnaise on burgers, awful.
On sandwiches, okay.
Well, these are great.
Okay, the deluxe is pepperoni, salami, bacon, and green peppers, blah, blah, blah.
Yes, yes, yes.
Gomadari pork, I'd actually eat that.
It's a burdock root mix, sesame sauce pork, shredded seaweed, and sesame sauce.
The Idaho special is diced potatoes, bacon, onions, corn, parsley, black pepper, and mayonnaise.
That sounds awesome except for the mayonnaise part.
There's one called the Mayo Q. If you can guess what that is, it's barbecue with mayonnaise.
Meat Paradise.
Pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.
Loki?
Does that sound good to you?
I think we need to go to Japan.
What was it?
It's called the Meat Paradise.
And?
It's pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.
That's just like, they have it already over here.
It's like the Montague's All Meat Marvel.
They used to have beef on their pizzas, but they don't do it anymore because apparently not that many people like beef and it kind of went bad because no one ate it.
Here's a Sicilian style pizza with tuna, mushrooms, and meat sauce.
I hate tuna too.
We could do a meat pizza round table over here.
Because they have multiple varieties of different pepperonis and different sausages.
I think they have chicken, too, and ham.
God, we could just pile that shit up.
I remember someone that used to order a quad sausage pizza.
That'd be four times the amount of sausage.
I kid you not, it was like a giant patty on top of the entire...
Pizza.
It's like, what is wrong with you people?
Here, Rob.
This one's for you.
Mochi, mentai, and potato.
Large shrimp, diced potatoes, Korean mochi, corn, onion, mayonnaise, we'll ask for it without, shredded seaweed, and fish roe sauce.
Mochi?
or there's the seafood mix, which is large shrimp, squid, tuna, and mayonnaise, broccoli, and onion.
Who puts, I want to know who puts corn on a pizza.
All the rest of it, I could take, but corn is fucking disgusting.
I've seen it.
And then again, I'm also allergic to corn.
Better yet, who puts mayonnaise on a pizza?
I think they put mayonnaise on everything in Japan.
So I can't go to Japan.
Here we go.
The last one on here.
I'd die of starvation.
Tartar Chicken Nanban.
Nanban Chicken, Red Peppers, Parsley, Tartar Sauce, and Nanban Sauce.
As long as Nanban doesn't mean like asshole juice, I'll be fine.
It's basically Portuguese-style chicken.
Okay, that's fine.
Like, what is that?
When you're talking about a chicken, it could be anything.
Anyhow.
Some of this is just like... I would actually eat it, though, because some of this stuff, I'd order something similar.
And really, the cheese and cheese is like a margarita.
The margarita pizza.
But I actually would order some of this stuff, because I have it at CPK, but still.
Okay, I ordered... How did this turn into Orange Lounge Foodio, going on like 15 minutes now?
Because this is why I want them to deliver Japanese-style pizza.
And poor Bobby got chased off the air for this.
Yes, he did.
Non-bond chicken.
Well, if he was talking about pizza, we would have been fine with that.
Note to Bobby, your show needs more meat.
All right.
You need meat paradise.
All right, stop picking on Bobby.
All right.
DarkSakura, what else is going on in gaming news?
Well, there is this plumber named Mario who lives near a pizza place.
No, I'm kidding.
Actually, it's something to be coming out for the virtual console in Japan is Super Smash Bros.
Like the Nintendo 64 one.
Dun dun dun.
It will be there in January.
So it's going to be out there for 1,200 points each.
But there's no real say as to when we'd probably get it out here.
But that means we probably will be getting it since we tend to get some of the stuff.
If it was a release yawn and hither, then it would definitely be duplicated over here, I would think.
So there.
Rob?
That sounds nice.
I guess I would download that.
What?
Meet Paradise.
Looking at some comments in chat, Giovedea in chat says, I have had a taco pizza with corn on it.
It was really tasty.
I was trying to, it's just pizza chat.
I didn't see anything about video games.
I get shrimp scampi pizza.
Except, oh, Acidic Vampire asked a good question.
Will Super Smash Bros.
64 have online play?
You wish.
No.
You wish.
Did the Nintendo 64 version have online play?
But in Pokemon Snap, they added the feature where you can save the snaps to your Wii message board.
So?
So it shows they can enhance the games if they really want to.
So?
And they don't.
It makes you wonder, doesn't it make you wonder if maybe Pokemon Snap at one point had some type of feature to save those pictures in some type of more exportable format?
Like the game maybe originally was going to let you save them to some type of computer or something, and now they turned it into this thing instead?
Because that's the only game that has had anything special happen to it.
Thank you for watching!
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to chat with us.
Aha!
That's exactly the type of thing I was looking for.
GameGuru in chat, see this is why I love having a live chat room, says Pokemon Snap had a feature to download them to Blockbuster and print them out.
So it's not, they didn't even really, really enhance it that much.
They took a feature that everybody forgot about, including yours truly, and just changed it slightly.
It's an altered enhancement.
Wasn't that a Sega Genesis game?
Alright, forget it.
How about some release dates, Loki?
Altered Enhancement?
Well, um, yeah.
There's, uh, nothing coming out.
At all.
Nothing?
Not a damn thing?
Not a damn thing.
Alright.
Wow.
Yeah, this is not a good time of year for, um, you know, most companies are closed, and
Yeah, not a thing.
Not even like Imagine?
No, the Spore comic book creator, I think, was the only thing, and that's not even technically a game.
Well, I wish I could tell you it looked much different in Japan, but it actually does not look like we have a lot of releases this week either in Japan.
I'm looking very quickly to see if there's anything on Wii.
Well, how about the U.K. ?
Rob, we've had a call for more pizza.
More pizza?
I can't even think about more pizza.
Did they have like a peanut butter and jelly pizza or something in that John's Incredible crappy pizza?
Um, I don't think so.
Well, they might.
I don't know.
I just know, I remember the ones that are like different and crazy are the macaroni and cheese pizza and the, uh, that peanut butter one that had the actual peanuts on it, which I thought was strange.
YUM
and there's an ebi.
That's the same one.
That's the shrimp.
And then the Shrimp Thousand Island Wrap.
You know when I go to Hawaii in two weeks, you know what I have to get at McDonald's?
What?
Spam Burger.
Oh my God, aren't those good?
I like Spam Musubi.
And the teriyaki pineapple thingy they do, right?
And they also have McPork.
and the Teriyaki McBurger.
So, there's more food for everyone.
We do have gaming news at some point, right?
Yes, we do.
I'm looking at Burger King.
Yes, like the merger of spam and shrimp and hamburgers.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, yeah.
This is actually very old news, apparently, and I don't understand how this slipped in.
My bad.
Apparently this already happened, like, a long time ago.
I don't know how this got mixed in there.
It's not the news, it's the old.
It is really old.
So I'm like, looking at this, it's all, has announced on September 17th, I'm like, what the fuck?
And it's all September 18th.
You know, when I was putting this together tonight, I was kind of like, I thought that already happened, but I didn't really know.
My bad.
But that's weird, though.
Okay, just wait until you say, and see, we were just recapping what happened this year.
Yes, we're totally recapping.
Fuck this shit.
You know what?
I don't care if they merge or, because you know what?
They're still going to put out fucking Dynasty Warriors games out the ass.
By the way, Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires comes out February.
You know what?
Fuck the show.
Let's go get pizza.
Really?
The sad thing is, I'm half serious.
If there was a way we could somehow just take the camera and go out on the road and take it with us to get pizza, I would totally do it.
I would say yes.
I would say, the hell with the show, pizza.
Anyway, sorry.
We can't do that, Rob.
We love our people.
I know, we do love our people.
Whatever, I give up, you know.
It was...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
They have claimed patent infringement, Konami has, and intellectual property rights infringement.
This was Konami of Korea that actually did it, because they're filing this lawsuit against a Korean company.
They filed it in the Seoul Central District Court in Korea.
They want to get damages.
They want to stop Pentavision from selling the offending products, quote-unquote.
Which, of course, has unleashed the outcries of...
Not fair!
Unfair!
Konami sues everybody and everything, and Konami, you suck, and da-da-da-da-da, and all this stuff, but... I don't know.
How do you guys feel about this?
I mean, I don't know how many of you have played DJ Maxx.
I've definitely seen the game played.
I have a friend who's obsessed with it, and made it a point to show me, you know, DJ Maxx, and wanted to show me what the game was all about.
And, you know, I did look at it and go, wow, this really looks like Beatmania.
I...
I mean, granted, I realize it's played with buttons.
It's not exactly the same, but the look and feel was kind of the same, I'm sorry to say.
But I don't know.
Do the people that say, hey, Konami just sues everything, is there a point here?
What?
What do you guys think?
I'm really not surprised in the least.
So I'm just going to roll my eyes and go next.
I am surprised because I thought, and I could be very wrong about this, but I thought that
and Pentavision, actually, the company that makes DJ Max, came out of the company that made Easy to DJ, since most of the artists in DJ Max are from Easy to DJ.
I would find that as a very big coincidence if that was not the case, but I would figure that it's more of a ripoff of Easy to DJ, and who cares?
To be honest, I thought Easy to DJ was better than Beatmania anyways, so...
Whatever, and they're going to go ahead and sue them, probably because they're planning on making some crappy music game for the PSP or something, because, you know, Konami's on the latest and greatest trends for music games.
Oh wait, no, they're not anymore.
They're way behind everything.
So, Hanukkah Harry in chat says, it's all a trap set up by Konami by not releasing quality versions of Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Beat Mania in the US.
They are setting up other companies to come out with copies of them.
Konami then sues them and gets a piece of the action without lifting a finger except to call their lawyers.
You know, as much as that makes sense, I don't think that's it.
I don't think Konami in their minds thinks they're not doing a good enough job.
I think Konami thinks Rock Revolution is a quality product.
I think there are people at Konami, probably Konami Japan, that think that that is what people want.
Guitar Hero and Rock Band are the subpar games.
Rock Revolution is a wonderful game.
And these other games are infringing on the rightful heir to the music game throne, which is Rock Revolution.
The problem now is that they wanted to make a music game and...
They're worried about infringing on other people's patents.
And now, unfortunately, since they came out with a drum that's totally different than what Drum Mania had, the best thing they could do is come out with what they did for Drum Mania, basically, and bring that over here.
And at a time, it was kind of neat as a drum game, but things have gotten a lot better since then.
And they can't come out with something that looks similar because they will get sued by the other companies.
And they'll be kind of a...
You know, 180 for them.
Hanaka Harry wants to clarify he was mostly joking with the comment, but I have seen that comment like for real reels and different threads around the internet about this.
And if you think I'm wrong in what I'm saying about the Konami of Japan is seriously disillusioned to their fan base, all you need to do is look at Beat and Groovy and Rock Revolution because these are the products Konami is continuing to put out.
Yeah, but see, I think in Japan, though, they're actually putting out some good games over there.
Like, if you look, for example, at the new Dance Dance Revolution, what would be the equivalent of Haas Party 2 over there on the Wii, it's actually a lot better than it is over here.
Like, they have different types of music and stuff like that, which obviously applies to more of the people that play the Wii over there.
And then you also have Jew Beat and stuff like that, which look pretty good.
But,
I don't know.
I don't think necessarily... I think they don't really know what their audience is anymore, and that's pretty sad.
But at the same time, they can't honestly look at Rock Revolution as a success, because it's not.
I mean, look at how fast that thing price dropped.
Look at the sales for it.
I mean, I think they speak for themselves.
It was a waste of effort on their part, and it wasn't much of an effort to begin with, so...
Get what you put into it, I guess.
Here's my thought, and tell me if I'm off-base with this one, but I believe that if you're pissed off about this, whether you're a fan of DJ Max or a fan of music games who is getting a little frustrated at Konami's putting out subpar music games and then trying to take out these other guys, I think now's the time for you to take five minutes of your life to sit down and write an angry letter.
And I don't mean an unprofessional letter.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yes, I don't.
I think you're wrong.
Because these Korean versions have been out for a while now.
But isn't it funny?
When did they sue the people that made In The Groove?
When the home version was announced.
When are they suing the people that made the Pentavision thing?
When the US DJ Maxx was on its way out.
There's a correlation there.
I'm convinced that... I mean, I understand this is all going down in Korean court of law, but it's still an international company.
Who has, you know, much bigger interests in the U.S.
and Japan.
So I don't know.
DarkSakura, sometimes you like to give your input on these types of protests and business stories.
What do you think would be the best thing for a person to do who's ticked off?
Honestly, it's going to be, you know, send in your letters.
Buy stock, shit, you know.
What did we say before?
Buy stock in the company.
Then you have a right to be heard as a shareholder.
So...
But don't post an angry thing on the internet.
Don't post petition online because you know what that's going to do?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
The only type of petition that's going to have any real swing is if you get your signatures, make a copy, and send it to Konami.
Because then the people that are advocating for you at Konami, of which there have been some, look at Jason Enos.
Would you have ever had DDR in the U.S.
without him?
Don't think so.
Okay?
DarkSakura?
Let me see.
Oh, just a little game that a few people were playing and then it started going poop.
Tabula Rasa!
So, NCSoft is saying that Tabula Rasa is free to play and will be free to play until the 28th of February 2009 when they take down the servers.
So, you can actually get a serial code from the support website and download the client and you can play.
So, I mean, it will ask you for your credit card number, but they're not going to charge you for shit.
So, enjoy it while it lasts.
That does seem weird that they want your credit card number even though they're not actually going to charge you.
Doesn't that seem a little weird?
I could possibly be.
Who knows?
I mean, hey, free.
Anybody here think they might check it out?
No.
Nope.
I might.
I might.
I feel like I want to know what I'm missing.
But it's kind of weird that they're doing this because what if suddenly people find that they really like this game?
Well, then that gives them incentive to put it back to P2P.
I guess.
We'll see.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But I guess during... In the first four days of the open beta, Home produced more money for Sony than the video download service did in its first week.
I'm not surprised.
And I guess the biggest sellers are the ridiculously priced Santa outfits.
Huh!
Oops.
And... Yeah, they basically said it's...
Make Your Trophy Room
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You know what's interesting, though?
They don't say, like, what was available on the store in the first week in the video store.
Like, maybe it's making not a fair comparison here, because maybe the video store had very slim pickings the first week, so it was, like, all old stuff.
I mean, I don't know.
I don't remember, because I didn't have a PS3 back then.
I don't remember.
I didn't use the video service, so I don't know.
Some people are excited about Home, though.
We have Trishlicious in chat says, Gotta save some cash and get a PS3 for Home.
I want to make content.
Acidic Vampire says, There are Echo Chrome cults in Home.
Seriously.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and he was actually trying to set up a gay-straight alliance club in home.
He's a straight guy who's a supporter of gay rights.
However, he found that the words gay and bisexual were not allowed in Sony's virtual world, meaning that there were a lot of kind of words to be discovered that were not able to be used in home, including hell, Christ, Jew, which, by the way, means all derivatives of those words cannot be used either.
So you cannot say, hello.
Because it has hell in it.
I'm not lying.
And the San Francisco Chronicle ran a quote from this guy who was trying to set up the club, who I think sums up the way a lot of people are thinking.
Quote, I can understand if they're filtering out profanity, but it feels like it's discrimination.
By blocking a word like gay, which is a preferred term by the gay community, you're encouraging it as a bad word.
A City Vampire in chat says gay is allowed now, so who knows, maybe Sony made a hot fix because of this news.
Why don't people just get over it?
The end.
Get over it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and things like that.
It just reminds me of this.
It's the same thing.
Honestly, I don't know.
It's not that big a deal to me.
At least it's consistent.
I don't know.
But here's my thing.
I don't think they should censor words at all.
Because people will get around it.
Exactly.
Like Tigerclaw says they can spell it as H3LLO.
How about this?
Have an option where you can turn it on or off.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If I press that button on a user, then it should send the last 20 things that user has said to Sony.
So Sony can review it and decide if this person should be allowed to be at home anymore or not.
If I'm abusing this, then I should have the button taken away from me.
How hard is this?
How hard would this system be?
And then I think you should be able to say fucking shit and cock and gay and fag and all that stuff as much as you want.
You can say any of it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I can't remember how many pieces it took to make the Santa outfit, but it was like $2.50.
And yeah, that's probably $2.50 more than I should have spent it on.
But it's $2.50, and I was like, whatever.
I buy these stupid $5, $10 games from live, and who cares?
It's $2.50.
SSJ100Matt says in chat, asshole juice, definitely banned.
Definitely banned.
GS68 says Sophomore would be banned.
It has homo in it.
S-O-P-H-O-M-O-R-E.
Probably another word that's banned in home.
I don't know.
You know, at least it's consistent.
But I don't know.
I think this is a case of a few bad apples ruin the barrel for everyone.
And there's people that don't know how to use these words in proper context.
And because of these assholes, the rest of us have to pay the price of this hypersensitivity and hair trigger of which we've seen Sony use before.
I'm a little bit plant.
So to these people who are...
We dedicate the FUs of the week to you.
FU to Dalmore for being in Korea.
I want to order eyeballs and wigs from that site, and they're in Korea.
So a $20 pair of eyes cost me $45 after EMS shipping.
Fuck a bunch of that.
Loki!
F you to my need to buy yet another airsoft gun.
Because I, you know, I bought a shotgun, actually, that's pretty cool.
I thought it shot three rounds at once, but it doesn't.
which is disappointing, but you can fire it pretty fast, which is cool.
But I have this urge to have another AUG gun.
And I really shouldn't buy another one.
Arcadian42, do you have any FUs of the week?
FU to the never-ending clutter in my apartment, which I never get around to.
Hopefully I'll get the time off I have this week, because one of my jobs is off, so get something every day, hopefully.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I like to braid my hair now that it's long enough.
Ha ha.
Ha ha.
No, seriously.
Braid, the game that came out for Xbox Live Arcade, is going to be out on the PC between February and March 2009.
So, they don't know if it's... They actually are also thinking that there's going to be a Mac version, too, which would be cool.
And no word yet, though, if there's going to be a version for PS3.
Alright.
Speaking of PS3... See, there's games on the Mac, ha ha.
A few.
Speaking of the PS3, Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 2 was just released and there is a problem with the game, unfortunately, that apparently a bunch of users are reporting that there is a glitch that renders their save files completely useless.
Selecting a corrupted save file will freeze the gamers on a permanent loading screen.
And apparently this is a...
Something that's going to be patched soon, however, because of the holidays, Sony's QA department is taking a little break.
So that means that the patch will not be available until after the new year sometime in January.
That sucks.
This seems like the type of thing that Penny Arcade would have done a comic about.
Is it just me?
But somehow I don't think there will actually be one.
Hey, speaking of patches, this has been a long-awaited one.
Castle Crashers apparently is finally getting its patch.
That's only about four months late.
The patch, I believe, went up this week.
I think it actually was scheduled to go up on Christmas Day.
No, Christmas Eve.
I think it went up finally.
So, hey, you should go back and play some Castle Crashers because now you can online anyway.
So there you go.
Apparently, some extra things were thrown in as well, though.
Not just some fixes to the game, but apparently I think they did some other little new things, like weapons and stuff like that, and two new characters.
The king is one of them, and so on.
And a chainsaw?
Do I see a chainsaw?
Yes, there is a new weapon, the chainsaw.
There you go.
I'll have to play that now.
So check that out.
That's one of those titles I didn't pay money for because everybody told me you really couldn't play it online.
But maybe I'll go back and check it out now.
But I still think... My gut tells me they'll put it on sale in three months' time.
So I don't know.
I might try to hold out.
GameGuru in chat says, Castle Crashers?
What's that?
Who cares about that anymore?
TwitchAscidicVampire says, I like Castle Crashers.
Cry.
Anyway, let's move on.
Moving forward...
Oh, I'm sorry, I completely blinked.
How about the Gizmondo?
Do we remember this thing?
How about it?
Well, they are once again rescheduling the launch of the Gizmondo.
They haven't given up.
The quote says it's due to the economic climate in the U.S.
as well as the rest of the world.
Maybe it might have something to do with your product being crap.
Um...
At any rate, they were deciding to turn the Gizmondo into a smartphone with a 3D graphics chip and an open platform.
So basically, they're just trying to make another gaming taco.
But open platform?
Yeah, they actually wanted to have an open source app store for the Apple store compatibility.
Oh, that's kind of nice.
I like that.
I like open.
And they wanted to make the price point $99.
So maybe.
Still wouldn't buy it.
I bet you anything that Duke Nukem Forever will be on it.
You know what's funny though?
It's funny they want to go that route, but I probably wouldn't buy one just because of the fact that I have an iPhone and so I can have the open stuff already.
I can get almost anything on my iPhone.
They're going to have to show me something I can get on their system that I cannot get on my phone.
Lots of delays and revisions before the product's even released.
That's what you can get with the Gizmondo.
You know, I gotta say, though, I know you're not a big fan of the iPhones, Loki, but I gotta say, it is pretty impressive that I can have movies that I like and music and games and apps on my phone in my pocket everywhere I go.
and you get a wonderful data plan that goes along with that that's really expensive.
Congratulations.
It's worth it, honestly.
It's not worth it.
One thing people forget, in my opinion, it's worth it.
Well, like with my iPhone, for me and Dan, our overall cost went up by $10.
Only.
Once we, you know, adjusted some stuff we were being overcharged for before, but still...
I like it.
I got Katamari now.
GS68 says, I have an iPod Touch, thereby bypassing the phone plan thingy.
Ranma says, yeah, but Sky, my phone does the same thing and I don't have to pay an extra fee for it.
There you go.
Diverse opinions.
No thanks, I will never own an Apple product.
Never, ever.
I don't care if Nintendo had a fucking orgy with Apple and their next product is like super awesome virtual reality that pleasures me.
I will not buy this fucking system if it's Apple.
I'm sorry.
I will never, ever own anything.
If they make a pacemaker that's the only pacemaker on the face of the planet that will save my life, I will say let me die before I even take that thing.
Seriously.
Never, ever will I fall victim to them.
Please somebody record this part of the show just in case because you know there's going to be that day where Apple puts out bacon or something that Loki is going to have it and we all have to remind him of this moment and say, told you so.
All right.
Anyways, apparently there is a new Guitar Hero coming out.
Shock!
Another Guitar Hero?
Really?
That they would do that?
Well, this one's on the DS.
Yes, I know.
It's surprising.
You know, what, three releases in a matter of months?
But there is a new DS game coming out.
It was actually found out through a description on the ESRB website.
Yes, Guitar Hero Modern Hits.
We'll be coming out.
And they've already figured out what three of the songs are going to be based on this short description that was talking about possible offensive lyrics.
Well, the three songs that are pretty much confirmed to be in the game, Sum 41's Still Waiting, Franz Ferdinand's The Fallen, and Paralyzer by Finger Eleven.
And no word on when Modern Hits will be out, but you can better believe it, there'll be a ton more releases next year for Guitar Hero, both on the DS and probably on the rest of it.
Is the DSi going to screw this all up?
Thanks for watching!
You think there'll be several versions or what?
Well, I just don't think that they'll put out a version for the DSi or maybe the DSi gets drums or something stupid like that.
I mean, honestly, they could maybe make a new peripheral for the DSi that would plug into the SD card slot.
Just a thought.
You know, maybe a DSi only version or something like that.
I don't think it's going to be an issue, though, because like I said, there's so many systems out there right now for the DS.
I'm actually kind of surprised that they're even releasing DSi anytime soon in the U.S.
because they're still selling tons and tons and tons of DSs.
I mean, I would wait until it slows down before they release the DSi.
Parting kind of thinks they're not.
And I think that they are going to probably release the DSi soon just to try to get people to buy another DS.
Just like they did with the Game Boy Advance.
Never forget how many times you bought the Game Boy Advance.
Or the Game Boy.
How many times did they release it?
You know, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Player, Game Boy Advance.
Alright, we get it, we get it.
Hey, another lawsuit going on in the Nintendo world.
Nintendo is getting sued over their DS Lite charger and it's because of a fire that happened in January of 2007 in Kentucky.
Apparently the victims were compensated by the insurance company as usually happens with those types of things.
The insurance company though filed a complaint against Nintendo now.
In the U.S.
District Court, saying, quote, the DS was defective in design, manufacture, and or because it failed to warn consumers as to dangers associated with it.
Due to defects existing within the product, which caused a risk of overheating and fire, the product was recalled by Nintendo.
So what makes this notable, in my opinion, is that you can't blame this on some crazy asshole.
But now it's some crazy asshole's insurance company.
No, I'm just teasing.
But, you know, it's an insurance company suing Nintendo now.
What do you guys think?
Hearing that this is coming from an actual other company.
And this is Liberty Mutual.
It's not some little podunk insurance company.
Is suing Nintendo over the charger?
Do you think it's going to be a valid thing?
Do you think people are too sue-happy?
Any thoughts?
I think that they forgot how hot the DS really is.
So hot that it catches fire.
Well, if it's a liability issue and they haven't put in any type of significant warning, that is negligence on the part of Nintendo.
So, yeah, it's a legitimate suit.
I don't see any problem with it.
All right.
Let's see.
GS68 in chat says, I think everybody is trying to kill Nintendo with lawsuit-y death.
You know who should sue Nintendo?
Kami.
Then the circle will be complete.
It's the circle of lawsuits.
Forget it.
We want music, Rob!
It's gonna take a minute.
Better not.
I'm going to start to play some of this.
Thank you for watching!
This is the game that made me import my Dreamcast.
Because I wanted to play this that badly.
And so it came out actually on December 23rd, 1998 in Japan.
And it was the first game in the Sonic Adventure series.
It actually...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Was that the one in the Genesis?
No, Sonic Jam was the Saturn release of all the Genesis and Game Gear and whatever versions.
Oh, right.
And it had a middle level that was all 3D.
It had different missions and stuff.
There's also Sonic 3D Blast was another one.
And, uh, in the... Uh, photo stages were...
They were.
They were in... Yeah, I guess they were in 3D-ish.
Sonic 2's bonus stage was 3D.
No, they went into a 3D box.
At any rate, you basically have your set levels and you play through with certain characters.
Of course, you've got Sonic, who is the main guy.
You have Miles Tails Prower, which I think is cool too.
Um, you've got Knuckles and Echidna.
And, um, I really, really, really, really would only ever play this game in Japanese because one of my favorite voice actors was, um, Knuckles' voice actor.
It's a video I never watched.
He was really cool.
He also was a boxer on Macross 7.
So it's like, I knew that voice!
I'm like, oh, nerd-tastic.
Um, there's also Amy Rose who beats shit with a hammer.
There's Big the Cat, who fishes.
Oh my god, I got tired of hearin' fishin'.
There's E-102 Gamma, which is the robot.
And you can play as Super Sonic once you've finished the game.
And of course he's all gone all Super Saiyan or whatever.
So you've also got Eggman for your bad guys.
Chaos...
Thank you for watching!
I'm saying Chao because I played it in Japanese first, so that's how they said it.
But they're so cool.
Who remembers the VMU, right?
You can actually download a virtual pet, the Alife system, and you can play Chao Adventure on your VMU.
For people who played this on the GameCube, you would actually play it on your Game Boy Advance.
And so you can raise your stats, and you actually can go into your little Chao house level or whatever, and play with them and see what they look like, and feed them coconuts, and do all kinds of bizarre crap with them.
Some of the other robots are in Gamma's story, which are the E-Series robots.
Also, Knights is in the game.
Night's is, um, if you're going into the, um, the Casinopolis, um, stage, there's actually a pinball area that's based on Night's, and when you go through the little special tunnel, you're flying through a Night's level.
It's pretty cool.
Um...
So it's basically, there's some, I guess, degree of RPG element to it.
In fact, it's just that it really has an in-depth story and you find different things to advance your plot and just keep moving through it.
But you've got your action stages and you've got your adventure levels, which is where I'm saying the RPG part of it comes into you.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Nerds.
You know, since this one came out.
Sonic Adventure 2 was okay, but this one just had everything.
I mean, from the sound effects when, you know, you get your bubbles or your shoes and, you know, the ending music being the same when you step on the platform, being the ones that you release your little forest buddies out of, you know?
It's just really, really awesome.
Um... Yes!
See?
Thank you for watching!
Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut
is an enhanced version of it.
And it has a minigame collection where you actually can get 12 different Game Gear games.
So you get Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Drift, Sonic Chaos, Sonic Labyrinth, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Spinball, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, which is another version of Puyo Puyo, Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic Drift 2, Tails Sky Patrol, Sonic Blast, and Tails Adventure.
Done.
Get it?
All right.
Check it out.
Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast.
And didn't they remake this game, put it out again, like on the GameCube or something?
That's what I was saying.
Oh, yeah.
Talking about the GameCube version.
There you go.
Okay.
There you have it.
Your classic game of the week.
And we'll have another one next week for you guys.
In the meantime, we're going to take a break.
And when we come back, we have a little bit of news in Part B. But mostly you guys.
We're going to be doing the mailbag and some quick calls tonight.
and we also want you guys to do this during tonight's break.
We're going to be putting together the Orange Lounge Radio Top 3 Games of 2008.
So if you want to participate, all you need to do is send in your votes right now.
Your Top 1, 2, and 3 game of 2008 using any criteria you want and I'll compile it all together during the break and we'll have ourselves a list that myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and maybe Brad, even though he said he didn't play anything this year,
Maybe we can get them to think of three games, and we're going to do that, as well as a list list later tonight.
So go ahead and send me those games, and we'll tally it up.
Make sure you label it, though, one, two, and three.
And don't send me other private messages, because they'll get lost amongst the other tabulation.
So we'll do that, and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
and DarkSakura.com.
So, anyhow, we got more news to get into, just a little bit, but then we're going to get into some year-end wrap-ups and talk about our favorite games of 2008, as well as the biggest stories of the year.
Lots and lots to talk about.
Let's kick it off with a little bit more news from this week, though.
It was a surprisingly busy week, considering it was a holiday and everything, but stuff going on, right, Loki?
Yeah.
Yes, according to CNET, it looks like Microsoft is wanting to add to the user experience and design for the Zune group.
And they're going to focus now on the Zune user interface, a Zune PC application used to access the Zune marketplace, and the Zune Xbox application.
What exactly is this application called?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Also interesting, this collaboration we're hearing about, it's a rumor, take this with a heavy grain of salt right now, but remember the game Deus Ex?
Remember that game?
They had like two games?
No, I think there were two games in that series.
I think I remember checking it out on GameTab a long, long, long time ago.
The whole series was designed by this guy, Warren Spector.
What's very interesting, he said at one point, I guess way back in June 2007, that he was working on a new project and folks would tell him that he has sold out.
At least that's what hardcore gamers would say, that he sold out.
Apparently...
Epic Mickey Mickey Mouse Mickey Mouse
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I don't know.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
GS68 says Mushroom Kingdom Hearts?
It's a nice thought.
And maybe it's a Nintendo Wii game.
I mean, you want to talk about selling out?
This guy's making a game that involves Mickey and Mario on the Nintendo Wii.
Oh my god, could they do a Mario RPG 2?
Now we're talking.
Now we're talking.
But they can't do it without Square Enix.
Sorry, because that would be epic fail.
Well, maybe it will be for the Nintendo Wii what Sony has for Kingdom Hearts, if that makes sense.
I don't know.
It could be interesting.
Could be interesting.
But I think there's a lot of in-between-the-line reading going on in this particular story.
So I think we ought to just wait until this guy decides to tell us what he's working on.
Could be.
All right.
GameGuru in chat says, Mario and Mickey at the Olympic Games.
Using any criteria we want.
That's why we don't like to say the top games of 2008.
No, they're our favorite games of 2008.
Using any criteria we want.
So if we want to put some game you think is crappy on there, too bad.
It's our favorite games of 2008.
Then I'll let you know what collectively is an OLR listenership we came up with.
DarkSakura, what was your number three favorite... How appropriate, this music comes on just at the right time.
What would you say was your number three favorite video game in the year 2008?
Rock Band 2.
Rock Band 2.
Any particular reason why?
Do I need to name them all?
Really.
It's just such a massive library.
You know, having the different instruments and everything, I just think it was... Even on top of that, you could import your list from the first Guitar Hero and it would all work.
You mean Rock Band?
Rock Band.
You know what I mean?
That's right.
Well, I was actually... This brings me to my next point.
The one thing that it did not have going for it is the guitars.
The guitars suck.
And I would only use the Guitar Hero guitars.
This is a game that narrowly missed being on my list, but I love this game.
What did you think, though, compared to the first game?
Because at first, when I first sat down with Rock Band 2, I was kind of like, eh, this feels like Rock Band 1.5.
And I think that might be part of the reason it didn't make my top three is because I do feel like it was an upgrade of what I played last year.
But there is a lot of new, cool stuff.
The multiplayer, when you make your band, you can actually save your character per your account.
And I think that's a lot better.
Because it was really irritating going back to playing the first rock band over at my friend's house.
And having to save my character on her profile.
It was really irritating.
Loki, what was your number three favorite game of the year?
Um, yeah, that's tough.
Let me need it down.
Uh, let's see.
And we're going to try to be a little different here.
Uh, Lost Odyssey.
Hmm.
Because Lost Odyssey this year was the only game that I feel is as close to Final Fantasy as we're going to have in a while until like Final Fantasy 13.
And I mean, people thought maybe Last Remnant, maybe some of these other games that had come out.
No.
No.
Lost Odyssey is the closest thing you're going to get to Final Fantasy XIII until XIII comes out.
It plays exactly like a Final Fantasy game.
And just even apart from the Final Fantasy series, it was a good game with a good story.
Another game that narrowly missed my top three.
Yes.
But I thought was still incredibly good.
Any game I need to go back and finish.
Maybe part of the reason I didn't... Yes, I need to finish it too.
I'm only like a little ways into it.
Bradley, I have no idea.
Did you make a top three list?
I don't know if you played enough games this year or what.
I actually thought of three games that came out this year that I actually played.
Excellent!
What was your number three pick, Bradley?
I have only three games.
I think I've bought like one or two other that came out this year, but I didn't get around to playing them.
That's alright.
So, number three, at the bottom of the list I've played this year, but it's not bad, but it's just DDR, it's DDRX.
And I've actually only played like a few hours of it, and the stories are weird, and
Well, would they put stories in DDR?
There's this weird thing.
They have the different stories for characters.
The first two characters, I think there's one or two characters that are unlocked at the beginning, which is, I think it's Emi, and there's a new guy named Zero.
The Zero guy, he's just like the stoic sort of guy.
He doesn't say very much.
He's kind of, whatever.
Sort of like a weird Bishonen-looking kind of guy.
Thanks for watching!
Show off your moves.
Sounds too much like you got served to me.
Yeah, it's kind of silly.
All right.
Well, you know what, though?
I'm glad DDR is represented somewhere on the list because we did start up as a Bomani-based radio station, so why not?
My number three game that I would pick on the list of the top three games that were released in 2008...
Thank you for watching!
and DarkSakura.com.
DarkSakura, your number two favorite game of 2008.
My number two game would be Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
Any particular reason why?
Dude, it's freaking... I only really played as Ken and Jun because I'm the big Gatchaman fangirl.
But it's really cool.
It had actually so many different touches that...
If you're fans of the old Tatsunoko series, it's just like big fangasm right then and there.
So many good touches, except for the happy thumb ball of doom.
I hated the happy thumb ball of doom, but the rest of it was pretty freaking fun.
It's just like playing Marvel vs. Capcom in its control.
It was really cool.
Some folks in chat room are asking, was Rez HD really this year?
Yes, it was January 30th.
There you go.
It was early this year, but it was.
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, a game I didn't spend a whole lot of time with, but I was surprised at how decent it was.
We were kind of all thinking, oh, this is going to be a little crappy.
I wasn't thinking that.
The characters we knew were going to be good, but you know you've heard of projects like these and you go, oh boy.
It's kind of like games based off movies.
You're always kind of like, oh boy, these are going to kind of stink.
But the game was surprisingly decent, so I can see that.
Loki, your number two game of the year.
My number two game of the year... Man, that's tough.
I would... I guess I'm just going to have to go with Saints Row 2.
Alright, Saints Row 2.
I thought a little bit better than or more fun for me than Grand Theft Auto 4 even though I still play Grand Theft Auto 4 today and that is pretty fun especially now that I can mod it but it was an overall fun game and I really can't wait for the next one to come out.
Saints Row 3 in 2010, maybe.
Alright.
Awesome.
We know you never shut up about that game on the show, so it's no surprise that it's showing up on your list, but that's cool.
Sandbox games can be a lot of fun.
Bradley, number two, for you.
This game had the unfortunate circumstance that I picked up a Zelda Phantom Hourglass and didn't get back to it, but since it's another game that I played this year, it's Sonic Chronicles The Dark Brotherhood.
I only got through like
SONIC CHRONICLES
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know, that whole games is art thing.
I mean, the game just moves like a painting, has a surprisingly...
DarkSakura DarkSakura
I'd say Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
It's been pissing me the hell off, but I've been having the most fun with it.
It gets back to what made Symphony of the Night fun.
Even though that game frustrates me to no end, it was pretty cool.
Loki, your number one favorite game all freaking year.
I'd normally go with Grand Theft Auto 4, but actually I'm going to have to say LittleBigPlanet, just because it was just a fun game.
It's hard to really pick one game, but LittleBigPlanet, this is definitely a game I could see myself playing months from now.
So, I'll have to go with LittleBigPlanet.
Alright, LittleBigPlanet.
Lots to do in LittleBigPlanet, lots of replayability value.
Bradley, your number one favorite game of 2008.
And it's actually not even maybe, not exactly a game, but it has games in it.
But it's what I actually have on my DS right now, playing.
It's My Japanese Coach.
And I'll let it speak for itself.
Sugoi.
Sugoi.
Sugoi.
Sugoi.
Sugoi.
Sugoi.
Sugoi.
Hey, apparently it's amazing.
That's what I love about this show.
You really can use any criteria you want.
So if you want to put My Japanese Coach as your number one game of the year, you go ahead.
Yeah, it's good for learning.
I actually recommend it if you want to learn Japanese.
If you're just starting out, you probably want to have some help or get into a class, but this would also be good to help along.
Especially it's good if you've forgotten a lot and need to get back in, get your skills back up.
A shout out for the educational games.
There you go.
All right, my number one game of the year.
You know what?
You've been listening to the show long enough.
You know me well enough.
What do you think?
My number one game of the year.
This shouldn't be hard.
Super Metroid.
Maybe about 15 years ago, yes.
Or number one game of all time, maybe.
Loki, I know you've got to know.
Sing Star Abba.
Thank you for watching!
Try again.
If I'm being serious, what do you think the number one?
LittleBigPlanet?
Absolutely right.
LittleBigPlanet is my number one favorite game of 2008.
Because I think this game is amazing.
Despite all the hubble we had about the moderation that went on earlier this year, I mean, God, I wouldn't even need half of that.
Those user-created levels and the game itself, even by itself, is amazing.
And I'm having a wonderful time with it.
And the potential that this game has for expansion is awesome.
And now that they gave Sackboy a gun, it's even better.
And this game is amazing.
So I love LittleBigPlanet.
It's my number one game of the year.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Here's the interesting thing.
If we were to put our list together with the chat room, there would be a tie for the number one game of 2008 with LittleBigPlanet, because Loki and I naming it as number one game of the year probably helps.
But get this.
You know what the other number one game would be?
It would be one none of us named.
Mega Man 9 would be the game of the year.
That's worthy.
Super Smash Bros.
Brawl, Rock Band 2
So even though somebody named Rock Band 2, nobody named the other ones, and those were very well-loved amongst our listeners.
Brawl, probably the Wii title to have this year, and Left 4 Dead, which, you know, as far as shooters go, has been pretty amazing.
And then third place would be yet another one we didn't even name, Fallout 3.
But, you know, obviously the topic of that's come up earlier in the show, and at least for me, that's one of those games that I'll get to it when it comes down in price a little later on after I finish these other games I want to play.
So, there it is!
Your favorite games of 2008.
Very interesting to see some of the other things that people picked.
Castle Crashers, DJ Max, Wii Sports, somebody put in their list, even two years later, shows you the staying power of a game like that.
Gears of War 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Fable 2, uh...
Castle Crashers, Tomb Raider, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Chrono Trigger DS, Bioshock, Mario Kart Wii, NHL 2009.
The list goes on and on.
Very nice.
Pretty good year for games overall?
I would say so.
I would say yes, unless you're the Nintendo Wii.
I think the Nintendo Wii had maybe one or two great games on it, and the rest was shovelware, in my opinion.
Loki, was it a good year for games in 2008?
It was okay.
It was okay.
All right, let's see if it was a good year for the mailbag.
Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com and we read some of your mail right here on this program in a little segment we appropriately call The Mailbag.
Well, we've only got one email, just one.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
gave it a thumbs up or thumbs down and limited this to only the popular or big title games that came out.
For example, I remember that Sky recently let LittleBigPlanet, but I can't remember what DarkSakura said about Animal Crossing.
It was the same, by the way.
Even if not all of you played the game, I still value each of your opinions because you guys never seem to lead me astray.
I'm not proposing an entire archive of what everyone nitpicked about every single aspect of each game.
I'm just looking for an easy and preferably online way to find out if you approved of a certain game before I go and get it.
Just something to think about.
I hope your holidays are awesome, Amplitude.
We'll see you next time.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Well, I will tell you this, that Sauce actually has a review blog that we've talked about some reviews on there before, but it's at Avengers-Tower.com, I think it is.
and she puts up a lot of reviews there.
I was actually kind of thinking about getting back into blogging some game related stuff since I'm actually playing things a bit more and actually since I'm chatting with her she suggested get a Gamefly account too.
If you guys know anyone who's really good at website design, and I mean really serious inquiries only... Oh, there's no Dash in that, by the way.
Just Avengers Tower.
Please send them my way.
I'm not talking about hosting or admin, because we have a guy who does that who is amazing, but I'm talking about the design itself of a website and being able to run it.
I would even be willing to throw money out there if it's not too extreme.
So get in touch with me.
A lot of times, and maybe you've tried to before, but it fell through the cracks because we get a lot of freaking spam.
But I'll try to keep my eye out over the next week.
If you have ideas on how we can get OLR's website functional for types of requests like this, I would love to hear it.
Because unfortunately, with a full-time job and school and stuff, we just got no time.
Were we using WebMatter before?
We're still using PHP Nuke, and it's an old system.
No, I meant for our old blog that we used to have.
Old blog?
Yeah, remember the blog that we had up way back in the day?
Oh, God, yeah.
I think it was called Grey Matter or something like that.
That was old.
We could probably throw up WordPress easy, but I don't know.
WordPress was what we used.
We could just try reviving that, too, but...
PhpNuke We just need a website that looks less less
Our strength is radio, guys.
That's the thing you've got to learn.
Radio is what we've done for seven years, not website design.
Hey, I can update PHPBB, so don't worry about that.
I did my own board.
Awesome.
I'm going to give it a refresh just to see, but you know what?
No.
All right.
That's all right.
How dare they?
Probably because I've been very behind on updating the podcast again and, you know, oops.
I will resolve in the new year to get us all caught up in current again.
So, hooray.
Let's move on with a couple more news stories.
Just a couple.
And then we're going to do Listless tonight.
We haven't done Listless in forever.
This will be fun.
Listless tonight.
Top three news stories of 2008.
Top three news stories will be tonight's list list.
It'll be fun.
It'll be quick, too, because there's only three of us.
And then we got Skype, too.
Don't worry.
We'll have Skype.
We'll have plenty of time for that.
Loki, news.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Do the financial situation that they're in and that kind of stuff.
And their forecasts that they're going to not really continue development on it.
The current market environment and the forecasts for the future.
And of course, they apologize to everybody that was waiting for the release.
But too bad.
Yeah, I think this was a game that they were showing off, I want to say, either the very first year of 360 came out, or maybe a little bit after.
It's basically, what was it, a team that composed of Miss Walker and R-Toon.
Yeah.
What's Mistwalker been working on lately?
Are they doing Lost Odyssey 2 and Blue Dragon 2?
Well, there's a Blue Dragon DS game.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I think there's some other Mistwalker game that's coming out.
They're working on a few things, I remember.
They've already confirmed a sequel to Lost Odyssey, though, right?
I think they did.
I think they did.
We'll see.
Hey, follow-up, too.
Remember last week, we just had depression upon depression.
All these studios were closing left and right.
And some of them were rumor status, and one of those was Free Radical.
Unfortunately, it has been confirmed that as of December 31st, Free Radical is going to be downsizing significantly.
75% of its workforce, 140 employees.
That means only 40 people will be left.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, you know, just the countless news upon news articles of studios shutting their doors is just one of the big things that happened in 2008.
But we thought we would take a look tonight at some of the top stories of 2008, the way that only we can do it here on Orange Lounge Radio in a segment we call...
That's right.
Here on Orange Launch Radio, we do a segment called Listless, where we invite everybody to submit their top three... I'm sorry, we don't invite everybody.
We invite the hosts to submit their top three, and then we have the chatroom vote on the list that is prepared, and come up with the ultimate list.
And today's topic is the top three stories of 2008.
Now, what's interesting tonight is that I don't believe Bradley is going to be able to participate, because I don't think he's been following enough stories this year to be able to tell us.
He's shaking his head no, so...
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
He who shall not be named loses his license to practice law in Florida, correct?
Yes.
All right.
That was a pretty monumentous occasion that involved confetti being tossed and hoorays everywhere.
All right.
DJ Dark Knight says, let the chatters kick one out.
I don't know.
Should we let the chatters maybe put like one thing on the list so we have a nice even ten?
Sure.
All right.
I'll do this.
At a certain time, I'm going to open up the Skype line and we'll let you guys put one thing on the list.
All right.
Loki, you're number three.
Oh, man, that's tough.
I guess because we talked a lot about it.
I guess it would be funny if Rock Revolution, Konami announcing that they're doing Rock Revolution.
No, that was actually the year before last.
Or was that this year?
I can't remember.
This E3 was the one where they really botched it publicly.
You might remember, so maybe you want to use that.
No, take that up, take that up.
I got it.
Nintendo fucking up their E3 press conference.
Care to elaborate?
Yes, their demonstration of Wii music and how it butchered the Super Mario Bros.
theme.
Stories about snowboarding and Sun's...
What was the other thing that they showed that was really crappy?
Oh, Animal Crossing and how it wasn't different.
Yeah, GameGuru in the chatroom asked a question a lot of people are going to ask you.
What?
Fuck up.
Some people would say they did not fuck up.
Okay, disappointing showing at E3.
Clearly they had the worst press conference.
They were supposed to make this big splash to kind of come back for ignoring the core gamer and
They pretty much ignore the core gamer.
Alright, we said anything you want.
TigerCross says, how about the drummer pretending to drum?
So you do have some allies in your corner there.
My number three that I would put on the list, I would say the story, and I don't know if you remember this, but part of the reason I'm putting it on the list is because of the endless lulls that it brought us on this show.
But do you remember when a website called WhatTheyPlay.com ran a poll?
And this poll discovered that people out there are more offended by sex and gay kissing than multiple uses of the word fuck and disembodied heads.
And I'll see you next time.
DarkSakura.com
Thanks for watching!
So we've got a free write-off of them, huh?
And easiest way to get some of those achievements because the song is so short.
Just want to point that out.
Loki, your number two top news story of 2008.
Just because it was funny to make fun of how ridiculous everything was getting.
The Little Big Planet Controversy.
Seriously, a song with lyrics that most people won't understand.
Can't possibly get offended by them.
What was up with that?
Like, seriously, the guy had won Grammys and does this stuff all his time in his albums and nobody had ever had a problem with it before.
And even the guy who complained about it was like, I didn't mean to, like, recall the game.
You could have just, like, patched it out.
Panic!
Panic!
Panic!
Panic!
Panic!
This is the new motto at Sony.
Whenever we talk about Sony headquarters, Panic!
Panic!
Panic!
Panic!
That's right, the crayon eating leads to panicking.
Do you think that maybe there's some chemical in, like, the crayon that causes people to panic?
I've died in before!
Alright, my number two was going to also be the news story about Nintendo burning their hardcore gamers at E3.
But since Loki stole that...
I will say the news that E4ALL got canned and Old E3 is coming back.
Because I think it goes to show a lot of people said, it wouldn't work, it wouldn't work.
And as much as they're trying to say, well, you know, we tried something different, da-da-da, it didn't work.
So Old E3 is returning, is my number two story of 2008.
Old E3 returning, bye-bye E4ALL.
Where did E4ALL not work out, do you guys think?
Everything?
I think that it was a good concept, but because there was already this expectation of what was there before, it really did rub raw with a lot in the community.
And really, I think, a lot of the hype was really, really brought up at the big E3 orgy.
I'm sorry, it was the orgy of game.
So that really actually cut down a lot of advertising for them, I thought.
They had a Target booth where you could buy games.
Oh my god, where will we find a Target on, I don't know, anywhere in the United States?
Oh wait, no, they're everywhere, that's right.
So yes, of course you need to go to E4ALL to go buy your games.
GameGuru wants to point out in chat that Capcom, he believes, was the worst at E3.
At least Nintendo talked about actual games.
That's a good point.
Capcom got up there and sucked their own dicks for an hour, basically, is what they did.
Which you'd think would be an impressive thing to watch, but in fact it was really boring.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
GameGuru says E3 is for the casual gamer and movie lover now.
I don't know, do you think having to go back to the old way?
Somewhat.
I mean, we say it the old way, although they say we're going to cap it at $40,000.
They say they're going to make it easier for podcasters to get in.
And I'm saying, I'll believe it when I see it.
That's some bullshit right there.
Maybe other podcasters that have done... Why podcasters if you're an IGN podcaster?
Exactly.
Which, by the way, they have, like,
DarkSakura.com
Alright, I promised that we would allow a listener to add something to the list, so we're going to the Skype line right now.
Who's on the line?
This is Aki Ripper!
Aki Ripper!
How are you doing, my friend?
I'm doing just fine.
All right.
Like the small, tiny detail that what the hell do I have to add to this?
Well, you got through.
You called when I said to call and chat, and I said a chat room person could add one item to the list.
So we are about to start our number ones.
So Aki Ripper, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?
Any criteria you want.
Well, the only thing I can think of at the straight really is the dissemination of that one who shall not be named.
So, I fail per automatic, sorry.
Oh, well, yeah, and that's already on the list, so you're not gonna try and add something new to the list?
What would number two be?
I'm... I really gotta be... I am so really behind, and...
Gua!
Pardon me, I just failed.
Was there a game called Gua that was released this year?
Guar is a band, I know that.
Alright, Ake Ripper.
I'll have to let you go.
Call back later.
Later.
Alright.
People so excited to call in.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Jason.
Hey, it's Jason.
Hey, it's Jason.
Hey, it's Jason.
Hey, it's Jason.
Hey, it's Jason.
Okay, sorry, technical difficulties.
That's right.
Jason, that's good news for you.
That means you can put on whatever you want onto the list.
So what do you think was the top news story of 2008 in gaming?
I'm going to be a little bit egotistical with this one because of how everything went out.
The new Metal Gear Solid will be an iPhone game.
Oh, so something a little recently here.
Okay.
Why do you think this is such a big freaking deal?
Give me one moment so I'm not echoing all over the place.
You sound fine to us here in the studio, just so you know.
Yeah, you said that, but... You sound like a tin can, but you sound fine.
I chose that simply for the fact that people went absolutely crazy about Metal Gear Solid V, holy crap!
We've already gotten Portable Ops.
We've already gotten, what was it, Metal Gear Acid?
Am I even thinking about the right game?
We've already got Portable games, we've already got offshoots.
4 just came out, and they were really trying to end the series.
The I in the logo...
Just prime over-analyticalness, that's why.
Well, you know what's interesting is it's not just Metal Gear that Konami's putting on the phone.
If I recall, they also announced DDR and some of their other big franchises on iPhone, so to me this is more of a story about that iPhone is starting to legitimately become a gaming platform of sorts, as much to Loki's dismay.
Yeah, Konami Mobile, yeah, that sounds about right.
Yeah, but they already had cell phone games, so that's a gimme, I'm sorry.
Well, not Metal Gear, hence my real reliance right on that.
Alright.
Yeah, but this isn't really a good Metal Gear game anyways.
Some interesting comments in chat.
Bob Copy says Metal Gear Touch will fail.
Pitstun says Metal Gear Touch is a glorified light gun game.
GameGuru says Metal Gear Solid Touch should be on Wii.
So should the Silent Hill arcade game.
That should be on Wii.
Alright, well Jason, thank you so much for contributing to the list and we'll see what happens if the chat room votes that it's one of the top three.
Hell yeah, you guys better.
Alright, we'll see.
Bye.
Thanks.
Alright, let's go around and get our in-studio, our number one picks for biggest news story of 2008.
DarkSakura, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?
The biggest news story?
I'd actually say our pair of anniversaries.
How so?
For the station, seriously.
Any criteria you want.
It's really big for us because we not only hit 300 episodes, but we hit six years.
So I'd say that's fairly monumental.
We're that bored.
You know, I don't know if there is another, and if I am mistaken, please feel free to correct me, but I don't think there is another show that runs weekly that has hit 300 episodes in the history of the internet.
Of gaming.
Hey, DarkSakura,
It's so true, though.
All right, no, you know, we do it because, you know, what else would we do?
Crack?
Loki!
Well, since that was going to be my number one Winners don't use drugs But that was going to be my number one because I did dress up like a sack boy then That was going to be your number one, really?
Micah, y'all are getting Capcom on me Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen I have a better number one though because this small event happened In May of 2008, Activision announced that Guitar Hero, which became Guitar Hero World Tour, would now have drums
and would now be copying Rock Band.
It would be the first music game in the history of music games to have drums and guitars in the same game.
Oh wait, except that's inaccurate.
But that's what they said.
Or something like that.
Uh, meaning, like, how, uh, they got up there, I think, and said, like, this is the first time you're gonna be able to get to play the guitar and play the drums and sing at the same time, all in one game.
And everybody's just thinking, like, uh, lol, rock band.
Well, I think they meant in the Guitar Hero series, but, yeah.
Yeah, but, you know, you know how them suits are.
They like to think that we're all ignorant, which is not true.
So.
Alright, uh, my number one, I mean...
I decided to pick something I actually think is the number one thing that happened this year in gaming.
Like, huge news, I think, that changes gaming in a big, big way.
And do you guys remember I've been talking about something that I said was going to be huge for gaming?
It was announced early in the year and then happened, and I'm saying it's going to be like the YouTube of the 360.
Singstaraba?
No, not Singstaraba!
Community games on the new Xbox Experience.
The fact that they brought in community games.
Not just that!
But Netflix, so I'm going to kind of loop it all in and say the new Xbox experience I think is the biggest news story of 2008 because it brought us not just the community games and the, you know, web 2.0-age of my 360, but the fact that I can freaking stream movies to my 360.
That just bumped up its entertainment capacity by a ton.
You know what I mean?
Not just a gaming system, but a movie hub, you know, an entertainment system, really.
So, NXT is my number one story of 2008.
But I want to specifically state it's because of community games and Netflix and not necessarily because of stuff that was just to kind of catch up to other companies like the avatars.
And, you know, there are some things about NXT I don't like, but I do think those two particular aspects make it very, very relevant.
Sorry, I know you would think SingStar ABBA would be there.
Maybe if I got to do a top five, I don't know.
All right.
So, since we're skipping an elimination round this time, you guys get to vote on this as it is right here.
I'm going to post this in the chat room there, and you can send in your votes.
Prepare for fluttage in chat.
All right.
So, you can place a vote for your number one and your number two picks in the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
These were the top ones.
Jack Thompson getting the beat down.
Nintendo fucks up the E3 press conference, as Loki said, fucked up.
Whattheyplay.com asshattery.
Steven Colbert is in Rock Band LittleBigPlanet, Koran Lyrics and The Controversy Notice that's Koran, not Korean Old E3 is coming back by E4ALL Metal Gear goes to iPhone OLR hits 300 episodes in 6 years I love how that's mixed in with all these other stories Guitar Hero announces drums and NXE Community Game and Netflix
So there you have it.
Send your number one and number two picks via private message to Sky in the chat room.
While you do that, we have some more news for you guys.
We'll get to the results shortly.
Please hurry and get those in.
Loki, we'll start off with you.
Yes.
Speaking of games with guitars and drums, Rock Band 2 for the Wii is finally going to get some download content.
Starting in early 2009, they're going to be, I guess, adding that feature to it as well.
And they're going to start with the content that was originally available.
I think the free 20 song pack or whatever.
So, that'll be interesting.
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah, free 20 song pack, I guess, that was available already.
And then the free...
30 download tracks from the original Rock Band download content library very cool so free songs for the people that bought Rock Band that's right because we people have to wait for a while well actually no I guess not because it just came out like last week or so so that wouldn't be too bad
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Nothing.
I'm very surprised.
Me too.
I am very surprised.
I'm very curious to see how the download content is going to work.
That is going to be very interesting.
Very, very interesting.
All right.
More stories.
Yes?
There is.
Actually, this is pretty cool.
For Rock Band, they're actually getting some new content.
Actually, they're getting Roy Orbison.
How's that for cool?
Who's Roy Orbison?
It seems kind of random to me.
Well, this is actually reported by CMT, but they're actually putting in a pack of Roy Orbison songs that are going to be on Rock Band 2.
They would know.
Didn't he do You Got It?
Yeah.
They would know because CMT is owned by MTV.
He sang Pretty Woman, right?
Yeah, he did.
Yeah.
Pretty Woman.
That's probably the song that's going to be there.
Just you wait.
Roy Roberson's cool.
Plus he was with the Traveling Wilburys, and that was pretty cool.
Well, Guitar Hero's going to be getting some more free download tracks in the form of two...
Bruce Springsteen tracks apparently let's see the Born to Run and My Lucky Day I guess My Lucky Day is off his new single and Born to Run of course is a classic track and those will be available on both PSN and Xbox Live Marketplace January 27th through February 4th alright
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There are cookies, actually, here in studio.
I know.
See, you left them here, and I was going to eat them all, but then I thought, what a good idea to keep cookies in studio on hand for those moments when Jamie says, I need a cookie.
That's not going to actually happen after the beginning of the year, Rob.
Why?
Are you going on a diet?
I don't go on diets.
Are you going on a lifestyle adjustment?
I adjust my lifestyle, and that's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm re-adjusting.
Will there be a type of cookie you can still eat?
Um, Fiber
All right, fiber cookies.
All right, fiber glass cookies.
All right, if you hear a crackling noise, it's because I picked up a call like a minute ago and the poor guy's having to wait.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's GSX-K and no acidic.
I am not ordering a pizza for OLR.
Yeah, please don't order pizzas to the studio if you know where we live.
That's not nice.
GSX-K, what's on your mind?
Now, I think I know what's on your mind because you live in a certain part of the Bay Area where you got something special this week, right?
Yeah, DJ Max Signica at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
Tell us about DJ Max Technica's Sunny Max, Sunny Max, Sunnyvale Golfland.
What's it like?
Yeah, basically, it's got, it's kind of like Elite Beat Agents meets Luminous.
You have two halves of the screen, you have this line going from one side of the screen to the other, and then there's these markers you have to press as the line goes over them.
And it's kind of like beat meaning that as you press the markers, you recreate parts of the music.
Yeah.
But will it blend?
No, is it fun?
That's what I want to know.
Is it fun?
Did you have fun with it?
It's pretty fun.
On the first day, we had like 20 people in line, so between turns, I had to wait 20 games, which wasn't really a problem for me.
I just played other games between rounds.
My god, isn't that like a three-hour wait, 20 games?
No, at least an hour.
Well, it depends.
The problem is the life meter on the game is very harsh, like
if you miss like seven to ten notes in a row you automatically fail and it's not like say poppin music where if you fail the first stage you can still go on to the next plus like on the final stage like the difficulty progression like from one stage to the next is really hard like on the first stage you can pick a level one song but on the second the lowest you can pick is level three i think and for the final stage the lowest you can pick is a level five so but third stage you have songs that
Initially, you have a lot of trouble with any end up failing within the first 30 seconds.
Well...
And you know that Konami sued Rockstar for Indie Groove in one, right?
Sure, yeah.
Well, I mean, personally, I think the whole Indie Groove thing had it coming because it was basically DDR just with different music and charts and, like, some modifiers.
DJMAX, I have different opinions for because at least it stands out to be different from Beatmania.
Like, for example, DJMAX Portable, that...
I mean, Konami's hasn't really done a portable 2DX.
I mean, yeah, there's the Game Boy Beat Minis, but from what I hear, those aren't really good, and they weren't very popular.
Whereas with... Portable's... DJ Maxx Portable, I mean, it was like... It was so successful that it initially became its own series, and... So, we just kind of have mixed feelings about this lawsuit, I mean...
Yeah, it's a lot.
And DJ Ranma S is a lot.
But at the same time, I don't know if... I don't know if PandaVision really deserves this.
I mean... You know, I gotta say though, you get us thinking about something.
I gotta say, you have a well thought out point because you got me thinking about something I didn't think about before.
Because, like, I...
In the Groove was DDR
Anyone in studio think that changes things at all?
I guess it could be used as, you know, you could play DDR on it.
Well, kind of like that Stepmania thing for PSP, right?
That's what I was saying.
Yeah, you can play DDR on it, but a lot of people would be like, what's the point?
Thank you.
What is the point?
I never understood the point of DDR on a portable platform.
Well, on the go, I mean, sometimes you can't.
or you can't take your pad and such with you but here's the thing though before I remember talking to a Konami rep one time about when they were planning on bringing over Guitar Freaks and this was like a long time ago and they're like well unfortunately they don't know how to you know they don't know how to market a guitar game for the US you know whereas like a DJing game oh people want to play you know
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
I don't know, it would be kind of cool, maybe like a Beatmania game or something like that.
Yeah, wait.
Yeah, there was a pump and a dim on the PSP, but that also, but that tanked, as far as I'm concerned.
Because what is the fucking point?
I mean, really?
Beat and Groovy on the PSP?
I don't know, maybe.
Oh, PSP and Groovy, oh gosh.
I mean, Beat and Groovy had a lot of potential, I mean, I can understand why it's only five buttons, but, I mean...
Whoever was behind Beat'n Groovy just handled it really poorly.
I mean, the songs are too easy.
They went out of their way to replace all the awesome poppin' music characters.
God, you are so right.
That's what's so frustrating about Beat'n Groovy is that Beat'n Groovy did have a lot of potential to be a really awesome game.
Oh, wait, they already have that game.
It's called Poppin' Music, and it's superior in every way.
It's insulting.
What Konami did with Beat'n Groovy is insulting.
to us people that have been supporting them for so many years.
I'm sorry, there's really no other way to describe it.
Well, I mean, I can understand the rationale behind the 5Bot mode, but, like, the lack of songlist and such, I mean, hell, look at the US version of Beatmania.
That had, like, at least 30 songs ranging from really easy to really hard, and aside from that 5K Beatmania mode, and the new difficulty system and the racism, which, isn't that really big of a deal?
I mean...
At least it was pretty faithful as far as the basics go.
Whereas being Greer, like, what the fuck is this?
Alright, GSECA, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
But thank you for the review of DJ Maxx Technica.
And I definitely will be going to the Bay Area at some point to check it out, I promise.
I might be there as soon as next weekend.
I have stuff going on in South Bay next weekend anyway.
I might swing by.
Let me know on Twitter.
I have
Free Time Ball next week anyways.
The problem is I have to take my female friend with me who thinks video games are stupid, so I don't know how I'm going to entertain her, but we'll think of something.
Oh, alright then.
Alright.
Alright, see ya.
Bye.
Yeah, my friend that goes with me doesn't get the video game thing.
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
I have returned to spam up the airwaves even more.
Please do, Jason, what's on your mind?
I wanted to talk about something earlier.
I don't even remember what it was, but something else just hit me, so I'll kill time with that.
Sure.
Is it just me, or was this a year of classical throwbacks?
Well, yeah, look at what game topped our list.
I mean, if we didn't put anything on the list, Mega Man 9 would have won amongst the listeners, hands down.
That's a pretty good definitive pick, and that is what I mean.
I was basically just going to elaborate and say, sure, years back, Nintendo has resold their whole catalog, but that doesn't mean anything.
This is the year of Mega Man 9, Braid, and I had another example.
Is it gaming or is it Capcom?
Because, you know, the biggest ones I think of, Mega Man 9, Bionic Commando Rearmed, which was pretty damn impressive, and Super Street Fighter Turbo HD Remix Super Uber.
I can't believe I paid $10 for this version.
The movie, The Game Man, in a mystery third style?
Yes.
I mean, Capcom was one of the biggest offenders in this category, but at the same time, I think Capcom finally started doing the games this year, but we wanted them to do these downloadable games when they first came out.
Yeah, yeah.
In a way.
But also, you know, a game like LittleBigPlanet.
What's the first thing people do in LittleBigPlanet's level creator?
Remake World 1-1 for Mario Brothers.
Yes, make Mario LittleBigPlanet.
I was going to say porn.
Or porn, but you know what I mean?
They'll make the cock level.
A large majority of those levels are, you know, remakes of other games from another day in this newer engine.
So there definitely is a big retro vibe going on in 08.
I don't know if you guys have gone back and actually watched it, or actually looked for it, but you remember the Gradius level that the Japanese guy made?
Yes.
Everybody was talking about.
Just in case, I just referred to it by name.
The level name was Libidus.jp.
He has made SuperLibius.jp.
It is a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up.
Ooh, I'm going to have to check his levels.
I haven't looked at it in a while, but that guy does some amazing shit in LittleBigPlanet.
It's interesting because he has, yeah, he did all of the Beatmania type level and, no, not a math level.
Anyways.
There was another weird one, I think it was supposed to be based off some Japanese shooter, but I didn't understand it.
But now, like, that they've given an actual paint gun, like, I'm curious to see what he does next.
You know what I mean?
Like, that's a huge, that's a huge extra mechanic they've put in the game.
The only thing that I don't like about this Super Libius is that at the same time it adds a very interesting twist.
But if you're getting shot at and you shoot that bullet, the two bullets bounce off and fly in the other direction.
And fly in opposite directions.
And like I said, it's a vertical scroller.
He has this, if you think of really, really old vertical shoot-em-ups, he has a crosshair that's not even a quarter of the way up the screen, permanently fixed right in front of your ship.
There are ground, quote-unquote, enemies shooting at you that you can't destroy.
What was that game?
There was a game on the NES that had that.
Was it Xanax?
Xevious?
You had that crosshair permanently fixed.
You might be thinking Zaxxon.
No, not Zaxxon.
I thought it was Xevious.
Xevious, with the little blue landers.
Was it Xevious?
I think so.
Because that target showed you where the bombs would drop.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what it was.
As you were describing it, I thought it was Xevious.
Huh.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Break it.
I don't know.
If I break the monitor, then I'm not going for the show.
Being the fact that I've never been much of a WoW person, I can't offer an MMO person, rather.
I can't really offer much advice.
That's all right.
I'll get to it someday.
I do have a lot of fun when I play a little bit of Planet.
I'll get to a level at some point.
All right.
Well, Jason, we're going to let you go to try and get a couple more calls, and we have to read the list list results and see if you're suggesting me the top three.
You guys have better voted me in.
At least number two.
I can respect a certain one for number one.
We're about to find out in two seconds.
Alright, see you, Jason.
Bye, folks.
Our fearless webmaster, Jason.
VXJasonXV.
Jason for short.
Let's talk about the winners, shall we, of Listless.
Don't worry, we'll get back to the phone and do a couple more calls.
Let's get to the top three based on your votes.
Hold on, I have to add it up here so I don't read it wrong.
Okay, there was definitely a very definitive top three tonight.
No ties, no nothing.
Very easy top three spelled out here tonight.
The number three top news story of 2008.
Actually, I'm curious.
Folks here in studio, provided you didn't look over my shoulder.
Any predictions on what they thought was the number one story of 2008?
Cookie.
Cookie.
I don't think that was on the list, DarkSakura.
Loki?
Cookie.
I'd say either our 300th episode just because they're kissing ass or Guitar Hero.
Alright.
Bradley?
Any thoughts?
No?
Alright, let's see.
Let's see.
Alright, um...
The number three biggest story of 2008.
This is definitive.
This is absolute.
There is no arguing.
This is a flawless process.
Jack Thompson getting the beat down was the number three pick for the biggest story of 2008.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I said his name out loud.
That just gives him power.
Sorry.
Oh, but not in the state of Florida.
The number two biggest story of 2008 in gaming.
The new Xbox experience brings us community games and Netflix.
There you go.
And lastly, the top story of 2008, the biggest story in gaming.
Orange Lounge Radio hits 300 episodes in six years.
You narcissistic bastards.
Hey, it is monumental, like I said.
We are that full of ourselves.
I just love that the chat, you know, it just goes to show our live listeners and the podcast listeners too, the whole family here at OLR, everybody that helps make this show a success, everybody has to spank their monkey sometimes.
Everybody contributes to that in one way or another.
Jason's going ape shit in the chat room and not letting people talk because they didn't vote his as the top three.
I will say though, Jason, yours did get some votes.
It would have come in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7th.
No, 6th.
It would have come in 6th out of the list.
So there you go.
Jason.
Very rude.
Alright, it's rude to silence those who disagree with you.
All right, let's do another call.
Orange Launch Radio's username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.
We'll do like one more call, then we will wrap up.
For live listeners, no afterbirth tonight.
Sorry, guys, we got a late start, so we have jobs to get to tomorrow.
We're already well after midnight on the East Coast.
So, we're not going to do an afterbirth tonight, but do stay tuned because I do have a special message for you after the show, just for the live folks.
Let's get to one more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
You know, Legend of Zaku.
Legend of Zaku.
What's on your mind?
Nothing but just gloating, just looking back at what was once this year and the next few days will be the next year.
Yeah, this year has gone by really fast.
What do you think of the list of the biggest stories of 2008?
I guess it was pretty much concise of what happened.
I guess Jack Thompson's disbarring should have been up there pretty high.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Keep talking about him.
Besides that, obviously, you know, Final Fantasy, you know, 12 and 13 on the 360.
That was the biggest.
That right there would have been the, you know, the big summer surprise right there.
It was almost like jaw-dropping that it came out of nowhere.
I think at some point during this year, Capcom came out and said, look, the only way we're going to make our money back is to put our games out on all the platforms.
And ever since then, in my opinion, this news has not been as shocking.
But that's just me.
But think about it.
When Square dropped that bombshell over E3, that was a critical blow to the PS3's exclusivity.
The only thing they have now is Metal Gear Solid 4 and first-party exclusives.
and, you know, so it pretty much gives, you know, people less, you know, less of a reason to get a PS3 in the first place since there's no, you know, big ticket games, you know, exclusive for their system, you know, aside from the ones made by Sony themselves.
So it's like, why should I get Final Fantasy XIII when I could get it for my 360 easily?
And rack up on the achievements and whatever other features they may have.
Because the controller sucks?
I don't know.
But yeah, you see the argument I'm trying to make, right?
No, I do, I do.
It was huge.
It was huge.
And Hits done agrees with you in chat.
The FFXIII announcement was the top story of the year, no doubt.
Square could pull it off, you know, in terms of making, you know...
that version, Final Fantasy 360 version on the same level as the PS3 then they'll be raking in shit loads of money because of the tens of millions of users that make up the 360's install base.
So it's like in that way they see a bigger picture in terms of how much money they're willing to make.
Everything else, every loyalty be damned.
Alright, well, um, Zaku, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and try to wrap up the show?
Uh, Steam and their sale this week, please, please get your, get Bioshock for five bucks.
You won't be disappointed.
Might as well go to Steam right now and just, like, get your cheap-ass games.
Alright.
Let's go.
Alright, a quick plug for Bioshock here before we close out the Skyplane.
Zaku, have a good one.
Have a good new, have a good one, have a good, you know, new year.
Happy New Year!
Alright.
Alright, we are going to try to wrap it up here.
And close up shop for the night.
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
Remember, hey, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about Orange Lounge Radio because word of mouth is really the biggest way for us to spread word about the show.
So we would really, really appreciate that.
Alright.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
DarkSakura, your final thought for this last OLR of 2008.
Reject false icons.
Well said.
Loki, PayPal's awesome to dump these stupid little gift cards that I have left with like $5 on each one of them and I can't really spend them in one place.
It says, donate the money to myself.
Nice.
How'd you donate money to yourself?
I created a donate link for myself and paid with credit card.
Nice.
Uh...
Arcadian 42, Bradley, whatever your name is.
No, thank you for being here.
And what is your final thought?
My New Year's resolution to play the games I bought this year.
All right.
Me too.
My final thought for this, the last show of 2008, kids, your pancreas is a much more important organ than you might have thought before.
Just so you know.
Alright, that's going to do it.
Thank you guys once again for supporting us throughout 2008.
Will you come back and do it again in 2009?
Maybe.
Sure, what the hell.
Alright, see you next year.
