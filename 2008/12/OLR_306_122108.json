{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Moloto Tonight, December 21st, 2008, many game companies lay off their employees this holiday season. LittleBigPlanet gets some big updates, and has a recent Xbox Live Arcade game been ported to the 8-bit Nintendo? Orange Lounge Radio Happy Holidays, y'all. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Santa, Jamie Summers. What? DarkSakura, of course. How you doing? I am. I'm doing, um, crampy. Ho, ho, ho. Bop fucking hump. Try having cramps around Christmas, you'll curse your uterus. Did Santa bring you cramps for Christmas? That and a migraine. Maybe you were a bad girl. Fuck, I was. I'd rather have coal, because then I could light it on fire and be warm. Say hello as well to the one and only, Techmaster Loki. Hello. One of Santa's elves. Joining us to North Pole. Yes. That's correct. Highly accurate. How are you this week? I'm doing fine. Anything exciting planned for the holidays? Um, yes. All right, then. Can you tell us about it? Well, I will in just a minute. Oh, well, okay then. Well, you should already know what it is, but, like, there's lots of stuff leading up to that. Well, sometimes I play stupid for the sake of the listeners. Oh, I'm sorry. It gets you to retell the story, even though you might have already told me. Sometimes I don't know when you're pretending. Radio magic. Radio magic. There's commentary in the chat room, Rob, about you saying y'all. Chat.orangeloungeradio.com. Do they not like the y'all? Am I not allowed to say that because I'm from NorCal? You didn't say it right. Oh, what was I supposed to say? Y'all. Y'all. Or, depending on certain parts, Ewins. Ewins? Yep. All right. And Jayrod in chat wants to point out, my girlfriend also has cramps. Coincidence or evil plot? We're here to make your Christmas suffer, you know, a little bit. Could it be a conspiracy? Are all the gamer chicks on one big cycle? That's what I want to know. And only unless we've all been hanging out in the same room for at least two months. Did you know, Rob, here's your unwanted education. Oh, lordy. That if you get women living in the same place for long enough, their cycles will align. No, I've heard it. That's why I was making the joke. That all the gaming girls, you know, somehow via Xbox Live, I don't know, have all gotten on the same cycle. Man, I'm a suck in college. Yeah, actually, because- Like, everybody hide, it's the two- No, it was actually true for my dorm. I could bet. Because I had a suite. So me, my roommate, and our suite mate were all like, chocolate wine, now. Of course, we were poor, so it was, you know, Strawberry Hill or Apple Wine. Mad Dog? Yeah, yeah. We at least had the taste to get the tasty Boon's Farm stuff. Nice. And Everclear. Alright. Because it was Alabama, and you could get Everclear. Alright. Anyhow, look, we're going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week, because we always start off the show. Not How Was Your Vagina, but How Was Your Gaming Week, Dark Sakura. How Was Your Vag- Gaming Week. I played Vagina Wars. No kidding. Um, what? Nothing. Um, I actually turned on my DS and then turned it right off when I got a phone call and forgot to play again. I played some Ragnarok, because I'm still playing. Ooh. And I've decided that I might actually go back to World of Warcraft for just a little bit, just to see what the new expansion's like. But I really don't think I'll stick with it. It's more of a, huh, why not, while I'm waiting for the Star Trek MMO. I'm going to warn you, if you're not at least level 55 in World of Warcraft, you won't see anything in the new expansion. It's all endgame content and a new class. That's it. So, sadly, there won't be a lot there for you. I want to play a Draenei. Draenei's are fun. And name her, um, I don't know, I had a name I was going to name her, but I forgot. Because the Draenei women talk like Natasha from Rocky and Bewinkle. Boris, look, he's moose and squirrel. He's fearless leader, darling. I guess that would suit. But, um, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. What? I, um, I am going to, in the next week, download Shoei Nikki. Oh, I know what else it was. I actually sat and watched a playthrough of Abadox. And how was that? Just as shitty as I remember. God, that game's hella old isn't it? It's old and hard, and I love that game, but it is kind of a crap game. Cuz it's like that's from Gradius huh, that's from life force hmm. That's from Gradius hmm. That's from life force The one unique thing about it was the down scrolling levels That was kind of as opposed to up scrolling from life force exactly there you go Loki how was your gaming week? I played more Grand Theft Auto on PC and I've actually started tweaking some stuff now because they've made it a little bit easier for you to actually edit stuff in the game You just kind of have to know what you're doing. It's a little bit like the cheat device was on The Grand Theft Auto's on PSP similar type of stuff You know you have a file that you edit some of the amounts with actually it's a lot easier on the PC version because everything's labeled for you, so I made a Pistol that would catch a cop car and fire in one shot, and that was funny But just some of that stuff then the game crashed because I shot too many cars and caught him on fire Apparently didn't like that much fire at one time But it's kind of like finding a balance you know between Crazy shit and between fuego and non yeah well see my next thing I want to do is because you can make your gunfire have so much kickback to it like if you shoot somebody It'll knock them over or you can make them like fly away and that type of stuff, so I want to do that But I also want to have the trainer where I have infinite health so I can basically you know catapult myself with rockets You know across the map that might be fun, so You know eventually I'll do that, but there aren't that many mods out there for right now. There's like a drifting mod a mod that changes the car names to I guess realistic cars and then You know the rocket pistol thing which I was trying to do that myself and the first time it Glitched it out where I actually couldn't select that pistol anymore But then I figured out what I was doing wrong, and I don't know it's just not quite to where I need it to be yet But soon it will be and then of course you know more Grand Theft Auto 4 multiplayer at work and that's still fun and Other than Grand Theft Auto I've been playing Dissida the new Final Fantasy fighting game and it's awesome You know it's kind of really cool because it's one of those games like you purchase it And then they have the prologue video, and it's like Listen, I know you're a fan of Final Fantasy, and I want to assure you that this was an excellent choice And then they kick your ass with a really awesome intro video, and then the game itself is pretty fun It's a little hard for me to play because I don't understand Japanese so the game rapes you, but consensually In a gentle way that you appreciate it. It's gentle rape. All right. It's just like it's like oh my god This is awesome. That can't be rape if you're willing So just say that's like a roleplay thing. Maybe it's a bit of a Sadism I see it would be like a hot chick all of a sudden getting naked and thrusting herself upon you But like see you're at first you're kind of like whoa what's going on here, but then you just go with it So yeah, it's I wouldn't know I haven't had that happen But no, it's it's really really awesome. It really kind of disappoints me though that they haven't brought. I wish they would make this I Put it on like the ps3 or something like that and then also expand upon it because you know this is as basically fighting That's all it is they have a little bit of cutscenes and stuff like that But there's no actual like you know role-playing running around that kind of stuff But they kept the fighting system in here and like say did a Kingdom Hearts type of thing where you have all the different characters from the different games They could really have a kick-ass game on their hands, but you know this is that itself is gonna be really awesome So DJ Dark Knight in chat at chat.org.com jokes. This is a aka or guys, too No, it's not even close to urgots. No way. That's not it's not even remotely close But boy does it have a funky name just like you know square likes to really give their game some funky names It does, but it's awesome. It really is awesome I got the fight garland that was really cool, and it has it broken up by each game So like I'm starting off with Final Fantasy 1 and so I'm playing the warrior of light I guess or something and then I fought garland for the first level there and Is the Warriors name AAA? No, they has no name. It's just the warrior of light or poop. It's my cartridge. No. It's not poop But it's cool Look as you level up the characters they level up and all the other levels that they appear in as well So I think I did have a party in Final Fantasy because I'm this mature. I think it was ass assy, but and poop I Think the last time when we played it on because I have the The WonderSwan one in Japanese. I actually sat down and tried to figure out the names to put in it in Katakana, so we had Dan, Jamie Dan made Eric for some reason one of his buddies who's kind of not all that all that bright And I don't remember who we named the last one My Chrono Trigger cartridge actually still has my friend save on it. It has me and there's Luca But seriously though like, you know, not to interrupt or anything This game could be like Kingdom Hearts, but without You know the Disney characters I mean if they for whatever reason lost the Disney license They could easily do something like that with these characters and just some massive scale and it would be so much awesome I want to point these Observations out in the chat room shower and says did garland say I garland shall knock you out all down And that was said at the exact same time as game grew asking to garland knock you all down I don't know. It's in Japanese, so I can't read that but maybe he did in Japanese I don't know Alrighty then anything else you've been playing this week Animal crossing played a little more animal crossing. I don't know why I'm still playing animal cross I need to come visit Nellie's village. I know well the thing is I tried you Know I don't understand this you apparently you have to talk to some idiot in the town to get a friend code What the fuck the guy at the gate? All the last versions, too, okay, that's great But why the hell do I have to talk to somebody you have a friend codes assigned to the game? It's stupid that way it connects to Nintendo Wi-Fi The first time I can extend it also is different per player Yeah, yeah, and so yeah what you want you get it from Nintendo Wi-Fi Then you can access it whenever in the game, so you just have to do it that one time I'm fine, so I have to do that, but yeah, I haven't gone around to that yet. I Will them awesome all right well then my gaming week I played a little bit of Animal Crossing, but not a lot I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff honestly it was a lot of the same stuff I've talked about in previous weeks Prince of Persia World of Warcraft And the only new game I really checked out this week was a dash What's so damn funny over there dark Sakura? I hear her giggling. I was looking at uncyclopedia about lavas This is full name lavas big-ass porcupine from hell Thompson Smith Uncyclopedia is so string is also a picture of one of the little aliens bursting out of someone's stomach Is this picture taken by hospital staff one minute after lavas was born cute little scamp wasn't he I? Think somebody in chats that made a lavas joke something about oh Dan shadow says you think that's fun try playing chrono trigger and name everyone lavas And I don't know what that's supposed to do all right anyway um the only new game I played this week was the free game. I love free games, and there was a free game to hit Xbox live this week I don't know if y'all remember, but it's Doritos dash of destruction Which was I think it was like I think it's an XNA game that somebody made or it was like concept forget one some type Of contest. I don't know if it was next I read it was a like try to come up with a concept for a game, and then they made a Doritos game Yeah, which which actually kind of worked out because it does it doesn't like overdo it with the Doritos like doesn't beat the Doritos Thing into you like you know obviously it's there, and there's definitely the product placement But the game is so random like it otherwise really has nothing to do with tortilla chips or whatever you want to call Doritos They you basically you can play as a truck or you drive around the town trying to deliver Doritos But you know whatever it could be anything and or you can play a t-rex and chase said trucks So it's kind of an interesting little cat-and-mouse Concept and I gotta say you know it's better than yours as far as free games Go is this something I would have paid money for Probably not maybe $5 maybe But you know it's a cute little cat-and-mouse thing going on where you can you know play the truck trying to deliveries or you? Can go and out try to eat the trucks, and you know that made it kind of fun But I don't think it's anything it's gonna have like a lasting value to it You know a lot of the levels kind of look the same plus you just would Unexplainably get these power-ups that didn't seem to do a whole lot of anything And the game it was handing out achievements like candy like it was really one of those games It was like push start you got an achievement for pushing start You know like that's how it kind of felt to me, but you know I'm sure the achievement whores will enjoy that But it was you know again for free. It's really hard to complain It is probably actually you know considering the free games. I can think of on Xbox live. We had what Yaris we had a Totem ball we had the shooter game Aegis wing that was that was pretty cool, too I put this on about the same level so it's it's a it's a decent free game Because considering it was product placement and my expectations were very very low There's also it wasn't bad this hold them. Oh, yeah, Texas hold them was free for a little while Yeah, that's true, but now it's not so that was more of a limited time for you Yeah, you know what else is not free hmm apparently if you delete your copy of Hexic HD mm-hmm you have to pay $10 to get it back really yeah, I didn't know that I actually transferred hard drives this week I finally got 120 gig hard drive And did the transfer and it kind of freaked me out because when I did the transfer it said some files were corrupt and could Not be transferred. I'm like shit. What did I lose? I haven't figured out what I've lost yet, so your marbles Well besides that I mean like what on the Xbox 360 day. I lose. I hope it wasn't any of the rock band tracks I'm just not gonna notice. They're gone, or if it was like hopefully it was one of like the crappy ones We can always redownload them. That's true. What about the original rock band song so You'd have to redownload them unless you sold them hmm if you sold it back Then you're kind of screwed there. I did actually never did so I still know people who still have I haven't checked I haven't checked to see what got corrupted But I haven't played rock bands since the transfer so I would I know that was probably the largest chunk of my old hard drive Was rock band songs because I have a lot of rock band songs You know because I have the rock band one exported the entire no doubt album and just like at least 20 download songs on top of that so pretty crazy. Well. I finally bought a Hard drive transfer thing that's not part of Microsoft's You know transfer kit. It's actually something to dump files to your hard drive and that kind of stuff To get well on top of you know potential modding things To basically move the two popcap game saves that pop cap for some reason said no you can't transfer to us You know a memory unit. We're gonna be dicks about that, and then yeah, I love how on Twitter. They're like oh, yeah We're looking into that We're looking into I saw you got a response though that was basically they couldn't figure it out No, the response was like you have to redownload the game like what the fuck does it have to do with my save file stupid not like Transferring the game talking about the save file well wait a minute though like I theorized a couple weeks ago in this first came up Maybe this is something that was kind of out of their control like you know They it's not out of their control all the other games before and after them have allowed me to move the save files To a memory unit and you know move it to another hard drive You know you may not be able to copy them to other you know profiles I understand that that makes perfect sense, but not being able to move it at all. That's retarded You know what else did that hexick HD won't let you move this thing so screw you Microsoft and screw you popcap that's right, though. I'm gonna do it anyways. I will find a way I know we have people from popcap that listen, so I I hope well That's why it does not go on both, but you'll do and Zuma For whatever reason your stupid save files won't move not the game the game is fine because I can delete it download it move It whatever I need to do, but the save files will not move And I'm assuming this is a big crisis in your house because Zuma is like no It's not a big crisis, but it's annoying because if you know my wife principle of the thing yes We put in a lot of time to you know Bejeweled 2 which I might add there the achievements are damn near impossible to get but you know for whatever reason we put in a lot of time into it and Especially Zuma. Zuma gets pretty hard too, and at least that I can get some achievements in but Bejeweled 2 is a bitch But yeah, I don't want to lose all my progress in that you know it's a game I don't care if it's a crappy game. It's still progress, and I don't want to lose it But in the fact that you know I can understand hexick because they want you to buy the hard drives and that kind of stuff I mean whatever, but the save files is just these two games That won't let me transfer them everything else works like everything. I got all that stuff moved over and took forever, but it worked But these two save files are just I don't know so I'm gonna try moving them with this one program that I got and If that doesn't work, then I give up, so Sj100 Matt wants to point out now if Nellie lost her excite truck save file, then shit would hit the fan yes But it might give her another reason to play it again I do want to say this is Matt brought up PopCap I did play the new Bejeweled thing on Facebook They have like a Bejeweled tournament thing on Facebook Where you get like a minute to get as many points as you can and right now I'm on the top of the leaderboard at least of my friends list because you can't see everybody you can see your friends list I got 55,000 in one minute I got really lucky with the chains That's all I can say but I thought that was kind of cute that they put that on Facebook, so Anyhow um so anything else for gaming weeks around anybody? I played rock band like the first one yeah Cuz that's what Julie got and I have to say I've forgotten how much I hate the rock band guitars But now I remember cuz it was forced upon me, and I hate them. Why is that they're flimsy? they may be better for strumming, but they most the time the keys stick on both of them and They wouldn't sync properly for the wireless one, and it was just a pain in the ass and next time I go over there is I'm bringing my guitar hero controllers All right watch a lot of net stuff. I know isn't the Netflix thing on 360 great I watched a documentary this week because now Netflix No, Netflix got smart, and they added an HD category on their watch instantly things I was looking at HD movies, and I watched a documentary because I've been all about the obscure documentaries on Netflix I don't know why but I watched an obscure documentary about The people that dress up as superheroes on Hollywood Boulevard and post for pictures I care ethics called confessions of a superhero was the name of the movie and It was interesting it was interesting seeing the reasons Why people did it some did it because they were like obsessed with their character some people did it just another job some people did It because they have issues a lot of issues Rob I want to come over and watch documentaries with you now that I don't have school. It's fun I said I have work. That's a sad thing. I have work, but not every day work. Yeah, I know I'm gonna come come watch documentaries with you all right. Well. It's fun. Well a documentary night We'll try to see who can find the most obscure document There are some obscure documentaries on Netflix documentaries. I got a screener copy of Eathletes uh-huh which if I remember correctly. I think that's the Film that Scott Rubin actually did some of the shooting for it's about those two counter-strike teams And they came to El Dorado Hills to do part of the tournament there And he was filming a second unit or whatever on that that was kind of neat Hmm, I don't haven't gotten a chance to watch it yet though tiger law points out. Yeah confessions of a superhero I believe all games interactive interviewed the chick that plays Wonder Woman on it, and it may set suma back set up You know I I did I was not aware of that I kind of fell out of the loop of AGI just because they were putting out so many shows a week And I couldn't listen to him because I had to teach all day But the chick that played Wonder Woman was probably the most normal out of everybody in the movie Absolutely she had some marital problems, but she seemed the most Stable I mean no quote unquote normal out of anybody there was so she didn't to me She didn't look a lot like Wonder Woman Maybe yeah, maybe that sounds cruel, but I just I just didn't see the little her costume was decent But I just didn't see like she did not look at like Wonder Woman as much as Batman looked like Batman or Superman Look like Superman. There's only one only one Wonder Woman ever and She was in the 70s, and she was freaking fantastic, and I really enjoyed seeing her in sky-high Is you gonna say something lucky no I thought it's I thought I've actually seen part of that show or Linda something that had to do with those people that were on Hollywood Boulevard you might hostile one in chat says I've seen that doc they even said that people Were protective like I'm the only one who can play Superman on this block Yeah, perhaps I Don't know. I don't remember They didn't really get into the inner politics But I thought it was really funny because like people like they like it was this big change when Elmo got arrested And they showed the news stories like Elmo and mr.. Incredible got busted on Hollywood Boulevard this week They joined the Cookie Monster in the interest for the way. They were harassing tourists or something like that. This is it was interesting It's just funny to hear the news. I want some money for drugs give Elmo money It was just funny to hear about Elmo getting arrested. I don't know why I'm easily amused all right look Let's move on with the show talking about housekeeping tonight If you were wondering there will be a show next week There is still a show next week the holidays will not be getting in the way same bat time same bat channel although Bobby the man who does the show before us is doing his annual year-end special Next week, and he's gonna have some guests on his show and all that fun stuff He might be starting a little early, and we might let him run a little late To help our yeah, maybe details a little just a little So we'll see but that means that means it made me realize that means next week is our year-end show I Wasn't even thinking about it, but yeah next week's the year-end show can you believe it? Yes, because it comes the same time every year. Yeah, and in there will be no show on the week of January 11th there is no show. I'm gonna be in Hawaii. I will not be here the weekend of the 31st what cuz I'm going to Disneyland presents Yeah, I should do we should do our gift exchange. I may go okay I feel bad though cuz I didn't get gifts today, but I'm doing anywhere. I am doing something different and experimental this year for Christmas I already gave you party ears are I know I was gonna say I thought Prince of Persia was my gift well No, not Prince of Persia Animal Crossing. Oh, that's right. That's you Yeah, you've already got me a gift Loki yeah, but this is cool though I saw this episode and I had to get it for you cuz yeah gifts.

I'm opening opening mine All right, I'm opening Matt's gift first, and it's plastic so it's Star Trek something cool There's Star Trek Pez dispensers. That is all kinds of rad look at that That's like the entire original cast and the enterprise as a Pez dispenser It's supposed to be limited, but I don't know that is friggin amazing And most importantly I want to point out Sulu George Takei does have his own Pez to censor. What'd you get there Sarah Ragnarok? Yes? Hi, dude? awesome Very nice Actually I was because the artwork is a different style, and so I wasn't looking at the character designs I was reading Raghu no, I was like oh shit cuz I read like an illiterate You know child very nice Japanese.

That's amazing sure that's amazing Well, it does have the new host, but it's the other one died. You know yeah has old whammy that is amazing That's cool. We're gonna play a DVD game or something. Yeah, I want to check that out the box yep I Got I got I got Took to your present. Okay. I couldn't think of what I want to read the card to so I try to use in these full That's fine. I appreciate it there you go That's pretty cool. They're up Yes, I don't know what that book is I didn't want to open it You know so I don't know if that's the manual or like an art book or something that they threw in I'm gonna open it right now But I figured you know Ragnarok DJ dark night brought up something about the prices right there reminded me Did you see the in chat room? Did you see the talk about the guy on the price is right that nailed the showcase on the head the manual? Yeah, I was joking about how I think that's that's a giant conspiracy There's more in my life journal Hitstun says does Ragnarok DS. Have any sort of online play. I think it's a few players like local This is fantastic because you um you do your attacks and spell casting by stylus control All right Well, what a happy holiday. We have here on orange launch radio this week Except for me. I'm a Grinch because I didn't fucking give out Well, I'm I'm doing something different this year It has this the skill trees in here I just didn't want to forget these all in my house, and I started to get into the point now where I'm like Whose gift is that whose gift is that? Oh crap? I gotta get rid of these nice All right, whoo Now that we are all bit. We've all been there's classes that are just for the um DS We're gonna hear a little tidbits about Ragnarok DS all night long There's a dark night. Yeah, if I DJ dark night and chat says Jamie wishes she could bring her online character to the DS game Quite possibly my characters are like over a hundred and twenty something right now So because I'm playing on private server. Yeah, I was gonna say plus you play on bootleg servers So I don't think that would be a dark night's fucking hot. I like J-roz star trek peso spencer What a thoughtful way to carry around your ecstasy That's amazing That's amazing That's amazing. No. I love the star trek peso dispensers. That's great You know I haven't really been like super into peso collecting in a while, but I still think stuff like this is so awesome Especially the fact that it's all of them like you didn't have to buy each one individually wow it's limited edition, too What a cool. Yeah, I saw that they have those at a cost plus That is so rad. I was like dude. I kind of picked this up for Rob. That's amazing Yeah, I thought about getting another imagine game this year for the DS But I figured actually giving you something useful instead of you know I'm putting pictures up in a second sweet all right, so anyway is that going on your Twitter all right? Well, I'll link the picture in the chat room because my Twitter is blocked from almost everybody so oh you could log into the olr one If you want all right, uh let's let's move on and get into some gaming news You know that we're past past the holiday stuff listening now We're gonna go some from such happy joyous wonderful news to not so great news tonight Not so great news tonight, and I want you to listen to the first stories in tonight's Show and see if they all have something in common because it's kind of sad actually it's kind of a bummer We have to follow up such a positive stuff with this Factor 5 has closed its doors the developer known for such games as lair And some better games as star wars broke squadron and even like turrican series Um and apparently they were being rumored to be working on the new kid Icarus and Superman games But they have closed their superman 128. It's the curse of spider-man. I'm sorry. It's superman. I tell you it's just it's a new Superman not tiny of the movie, but So they have closed their doors, and it was supposedly confirmed by Matt Casamani from IgM who had I believe received an email from Julian at Factor 5 says hi Matt. How have you been? Wanted to contact you with some late-breaking news We just learned inside sources that developer Factor 5 has officially closed the doors as of today That's some pretty big news considering that those guys have been around for quite a while It's definitely a real shame, and I hope this information is helpful to you Do you know who we have to blame for this lair? No, Ronald Regan. Why? Reganomics Seriously, that's what caused um, that's one of the big contributors to our financial crisis right now Well, perhaps it continues on in these other stories we're getting into such as about electronic arts Electronic arts had to cut 1,000 jobs and closed like nine different publishing locations including one of them called black box studio This is in addition to when they already laid off six percent of their staff back in October So now it's just been basically an increase to a ten percent reduction overall. It was 1,000 employees That are all being phased out by March 31st So well, I guess hooray that some get to keep their jobs through the holidays, but still Blackbox studio in Vancouver is going to be merged with the EA studio in nearby Burnaby Wow, so this is going to save the company 120 million annually But costing them about 60 million in restructuring charges while this goes on Kind of a bummer for those folks that got laid off. Sorry to hear about I had some friends that worked at EA I have no idea, you know, they're not people I talk to every day So, I don't know if anybody I know isn't affected by this but still My thoughts are with you guys. This is this is very unfortunate Well, um, there actually is a going for midway to the rumor was that they were going to be laying out Laying out laying off, um around 160 people from the Chicago studio for the most part because of financial issues The official word is that they're laying 25 percent off of its workforce. So that's about 180 people 130 people from Chicago and 45 from Austin The Austin operation itself has closed and then there's supposed to be some other Games that were unannounced that are being suspended. So they're just trying to uh, I guess mitigate, you know, whatever the costs are apparently the Mortal Kombat team is safe. We can all sleep Easy, I think Whatever. It's just crap And Even more upsetting for me Free Radical has closed shop. Um, apparently their doors were locked and all the employees were locked out While the company was having some final meetings deciding what the fate of the company was going to be Of course Free Radical is known for the Kind of a failure ps3 game haze but better known for their time splitter series as well as um, Remember to be working on Star Wars Battlefront II They were working on TimeSplitters IV. Um, so that kind of sucks but um The good news is though is they may not be out of work for long. Apparently some other companies are looking to Purchase Free Radical and kind of absorb them into their You know Developing firms. So that's kind of good because I want to see TimeSplitters IV. It was kind of neat since they were You know Looking for new jobs. Some of the people are working on different art. We're releasing assets for TimeSplitters IV and oh man, it looked awesome Also if that doesn't work out, the founder of Free Radical is setting up a new studio called Pumpkin Beach And right now he's got 20 former Free Radical developers and um, You know, there's going to be that seems like a lot of development for just a week. Did this all happen this week? Yeah, wow. Yeah. Um, so I guess The guess will the the new studio had been formed a few months before this whole I guess Um, I guess, uh, the thing happened. So, you know, this was You know working out before everything. Maybe he kind of figured that this was going to happen anyways, and so kind of a precautionary measure but um That's what I'm wondering if this guy didn't kind of see the writing on the wall Maybe but um, yeah, hopefully some way or another that TimeSplitters IV comes out. That's really all that i'm concerned about You know that and that these people have jobs, but mainly TimeSplitters IV GameGuru in chat says this is what happens when you don't support the console that won. That's the Wii my friends Oh, but wait a minute. Look at EA. They just laid off a bunch of people. They they've been big supporters of the Wii, right? They've been sort of, yeah. GameGuru says the economic crisis just accelerated the problem. I can't really say Free Radical Wasn't supporting, you know, the Wii. They've only made one game since the new consoles have come out, you know, Haze, so That's not really fair Well, another company is seem to be cutting back on staff. It's uh, I'm sorry, Asper is the name of the company and they are based out of Austin They're probably most known for some of their porting work They ported Call of Duty 4 and Sims 2 to the PC and the Mac respectively. They got hit with layoffs this week They got hit with layoffs this week more than a dozen temporary full-time employees were laid off as well as some other regular employees More layoffs are expected and the company also shut down internal servers Also some other stuff they did Guitar Hero 3 they did that port Wow, so, uh, no, uh comments out of Asper that I should note though that that story was just a rumor status only Um, however, it unfortunately would not be surprising considering all the other news we're hearing this week well It's not really just those we've got more turbine is um going to be uh cutting jobs according to uh What they're saying is that they are actually going to be um, they didn't say how many but the quote says as part of this transition Some of our talented colleagues will not be with us going forward So ouch yeah, in other words are like oh fuck bye Really So let me point out that's one two three four five six companies in one week That have all done some type of layoffs right before Christmas right before the holidays assholes Although granted some of them have uh, you know our um, like ea was transitioning them out on march 31st or whatever But some of them just came to work and found that the doors and windows were all locked Which is I don't know kind of messed up. It's it's just sad. I mean that reminds me of when dan got laid off in the money store Really? Is that what happened similar? They just went in found a bunch of people walking out with stuff And so they're like, um, just pack your desks and go wow My gosh, they bribed us to stay um Here's my question. Is this going to continue? I mean this was six in a week Are we gonna see more throughout the next few weeks or what's gonna happen? Blame Reagan blame Bush I I who's next blame the Republicans. Well, wait a minute though. Let's not get too political here Seriously if you look at it historically the reason why you're wearing all this financial shit is because of of reagan's whole reaganomics crap and the fact that you know people have decided just to You know screw us over instead of you know, putting money back into the economy where it goes You know, we're spending money on a war. We didn't need to spend you know money on And all this other bullshit It just should have looked out what the country needs and go for the best thing and now as a result We're seeing and it's not just this there's other companies like I went to uh old fulsome Today and I say yesterday and at least a third of the old shops there were either closed or going out of business The coffee place I go to they close down without a word It's just you're seeing more and more businesses closing down. It's not just in the video game industry Regardless of you know, whatever path we took to get here. How are we gonna get out? I guess would be my question is I mean is the end in sight are we gonna get out of this anytime soon? What's it gonna take? I mean, do we just need to buy more video games or what? Well, it's a lot more complex than that. I mean a lot of it is going to be consumers, you know having more faith In the industries and you know putting their money into product But um, it's also going to mean that to be able to put money into the purchase of products There need to be the jobs available. So it's very much right now a catch-22 damn if you do damn if you don't It's it's really gonna take I think the companies being able to be in a financial position to where they can start hiring again And start putting out more product so that these people who now have fresh incomes can go out and put their money back into the the Money flow. Oh, we'll see what happens in 2009. Hopefully it won't be much longer. We'll see though Moving on um, you know all this news makes us very sad and upset and angry that all these uh, Great game studios are just closing their way on well some not so great, but they're all closing their doors Uh, it just stinks the whole thing stinks. And so we uh dedicate the fus of the week to uh, Those without a job this week Is that a job this week my first fu goes towards my girl bits for hurting me and causing you pain Therefore I have to turn around and hurt other people and cause them pain Because they don't have to endure this type of thing. So we have to share it with them somehow Um, also, um an fu goes um on behalf of one of my friends who didn't necessarily say this herself But i'm passing it on for her Um to uh the lack of uh proper transplants for her dad um, she is a really good friend of mine from college and I hope that her dad gets uh, the liver and other organs he needs soon because He really really needs it And um, my my final fu goes again towards the bullshit that um, bush is pulling In you know in his last few days god, I can't wait till he's gone Loki Um fu to rude people at the stores, especially this time of year Uh, there was some lady in front of us when we were trying to buy some You know gifts and first off she's taking forever with her transaction And kept wanting to you know, do idle chit chat and then when she was done Uh, she sat there and started packing her crap into her purse for a good like three or four minutes We're still waiting there trying to like get our shit done like the checkers already, you know running ourselves by and you know She's just sitting there going, you know, trying to talk to the person stuff I was like get the fuck out of my way you stupid whore So a few rude people and then there's a ton of people can't drive correctly, especially now in the rain. So Screw them, too um, my a few of the week goes to the fact that i'm Feeling pains in my side and I don't know if i'm just imagining it or if it's something weird happening again or what have you I'll try to go to the doctor. Maybe it is my uterus. I don't know but you know I don't know like I just get freaked out. It's been a hell of a year. I just want 2008 to go die in a fire First of all, I would like to uh, tell the entire chat room Don't wish assassination, you know, that's you're wishing murder on somebody however complete incapacitation of both bush and cheney Would be fantastic if someone were to do that because that would put flossie in charge until obama takes over she is a speaker of the house All right. I want to know uh, and my other a few goes to uh, selfish people That's it All right, in uh early 2009, we'll be receiving a brand new game From the creator of such wonderful games as katamari damasi and all the other sequels. Um, Takahashi, um is releasing nobi nobi boy on the playstation network and They had a few videos that came out this week for it and I still don't know what the hell this game's about It's like you're this stretchy thing that Tries to hook a bunch of things up with your body and I don't know what exactly that's supposed to be for But apparently, uh, you can stretch your body You can devour things I'm not really sure what exactly you do, but it's supposed to be coming out in japan on january 29th for 800 yen And uh the us probably around the same time so early 2009 But man, this game is weird and it's not like that trailer that we saw. It's not 2d at all. It's just Weird well, you know, we did say that katamari damashi was weird, right? Yeah, but this looks really weird like even like katamari. I you know, you could watch a trailer and get it You know, you just oh you roll over things and your ball gets bigger this is like it's giant tube thing eating things and Tying things up with its body I don't get what the point is. That sounds fantastic. It's like Bizarro snake it is like a bizarro snake. It's like, you know, everyone's like all happy and stuff and he starts eating people And it's like oh my god. This isn't good at all eating people is great Nom nom nom. Nobby. Nobby's made of people. It's good Hey little big planet got some updates this week. You got two patches back to back 1.06 and 1.07 1.06 now it uh, it upgraded the moderation feature of the game, which a lot of people would say was badly needed Now your unpublished levels can be edited by creators. They will not be erased for Evers and believe it or not You'll now get an explanation when your level is moderated. Tadaa! Finally after all that bitching and moaning some updates to the moderation 1.07 was also a good one. It was a good one. It was a good one. It was a good one 1.07 was also released like almost back-to-back this week and now you can actually find user-created levels a lot easier Apparently the cool levels has a different algorithm. So it's not just a bunch of trophy whoring levels anymore Which is kind of cool. I actually went in there and looked and it actually It was some different stuff in there, which is kind of cool. And now they've also added the little big store Kind of like how they added the store and rock band a little later on Well now they have a another world that you go into. Well, it's it's still earth but it shows the little pictures of little suits and other things that you have yet to buy and Confirms which stuff you have already purchased for the game. So that's kind of cool and also very cool You know, they I know a medium molecule and Sony in general took a lot of shit for the moderation It's nice that they are making attempts to fix it. Thank you What? This is just what? What? I clicked on the link in the chat room. Uh-huh that was Uh posted by tiger claw, uh, which I think we're covering later in the show. Okay, then never mind. Yeah That's what I get Well, how about some different news about sing star? they're doing wireless microphones that will be out next year and um They're uh Actually, uh saying that there's going to be a hundred uh trial packs also available to Uh, I guess just a number of different sing star followers on their myspace But the packs are going to be two wireless microphones usb receiver a mini b usb cable and four double a batteries so Like I want one for sing star abba, which by the way There is now a sing star abba theme in the playstation network store that you can download for your ps3 What that you I don't know we know it all yet, but you know, it's coming out next year What here that's coming out also in europe or may have already come out what sing star queen? Oh cool. I heard about things. I heard there was there was a queen one coming out I'm, totally gonna buy that in the us now. Awesome That is exciting because queen is all sorts of awesome queen is very awesome Oh, it's gonna have the videos and everything. I bet huh? So rub. What is your favorite queen? That's gonna be amazing. You know, I have to stick with the old um uh, bohemian rhapsody, but I do have a big love for bicycle What about you matt? Uh, bohemian rhapsody and no one or was it a no one wants to live forever. I think my favorites would be um Um somebody to love that's my favorite of all time. And oh, that's a great song. My second is killer queen These are all good songs. I can't wait for this game. That's gonna be amazing You know, the only thing that would be better would be sing star journey, you know, I had to say it sing star heart See now it would only be good. I think that these are just a queen pack for a rock band. So that'd be a lot better Yeah They do need to have sing star butt rock That would be amazing. It's poison and motley crew and uh That would be sweet. Uh, and I have to have cinderella and dakken and night ranger And night ranger And dan yankees because of ted nugent well other things Nugent everything's awesome. And also from sony, uh pots upon two is um out in japan right now But it will be coming to other regions in early 2009 february and probably north america and um Yeah pot upon is actually pretty cool. I didn't get to play a lot of the game. I just kind of gave up on it After a while, but it was fun Definitely unique little game and you know, i'd like to see more in that crazy style But i'd also like to see it like on other systems, you know, I don't want to have to always bring out the psp to play this Port that shit because it'd look awesome on the ps3 Because it'd look awesome on the ps3 pata pata pata would it it was a very interesting little game Rob i'm cold. It would be even better a heater if the buttons um Spelled out or sung out of damn yankees songs. That'd be great I Hate everything about your mother. That wasn't damn yankees. No, I oh i'm thinking that was ugly kid joe. I'm, sorry I'm thinking uh high enough was damn yankees, wasn't it? Because it's fucking ted nugent Ted nugent eats meat and shoots guns. I like this man Uh, all right, I saw him on tv skinning a deer Ted nugent's fucking hot Uh, unfortunately won't be able to skin a deer a little big planet, but You will get paint guns, which is kind of cool. I mean I do have a challenge out there for you folks to make a level where you do skin a deer. You can probably do that I have to actually I have to go back to ronma Queens ryke is the shit Although you misspelled it because queens the lead singer of queens ryke is a trained opera singer and he's just got this fantastic voice Anyway, i'm sorry. That's right. I would like to see um sack boy's house of blood in um Um in little big planet. I want to see some really I did disturbing levels one time and I I just never got around to Actually trying to make anything in this game, but you know thought about it making a saw themed level But you know, I couldn't figure out how I could You know do that I don't know. Well, maybe some of the new items in the metal gear solid pack will help you because yeah They're getting paint guns Um now apparently you're going to get a paintball gun that you can use to actually shoot down enemies and all this stuff Apparently trophies are being added go figure like 11 trophies are being added in this pack But here's what I don't understand about this is that I I was assuming that the metal gear solid thing was for users to create levels But it is but so why? Why then are there these new trophies because shouldn't I get to play it still if somebody else makes the level using it? Or am I going to get locked out? Here's the thing This level pack you're downloading you get It's a level and then you get objects including this paintball gun from the plane that level and there's trophies tied in with The few levels that are there basically the levels are to teach you how to use the paintball gun because The paintball gun is going to allow you to make shooter games now They're going to have objects that will detect how many hits with the paintball gun before they are destroyed Also remember before how people were trying to create objects that like shot bullets and stuff Well, now they have some sort of like energy blast things that come out of them. It's a new sort of like damaging object That's going to be available and you'll get all those by playing through levels So that's gonna be awesome then it that is a very major download Instant purchase from me. I'm also well. I'm happy to hear the media molecule is doing some of this Themselves because the levels they did were some of the best honestly they really really were it it was a very They really really were it it looks really cool. I mean it if you watch the trailer for it very very cool looking Yeah, I do watch the trailer. It looks very cute. I just didn't understand how it worked a little bit contra Well now I understand well, hey now this is also kind of neat is that they're also getting some level packs not just for this But they I guess this just came out this past week Um, I don't remember seeing it on the store, but I didn't really look very hard Um, the holiday pack is now apparently out. It was supposed to come out december 18th for 299 and uh, it's the festive level pack and it's supposed to contain two new costumes some new material new objects six new decorations And tons and tons of tons of new stickers, but however, um with this pack levels themselves are not apparently included So, but they just have the stickers though. Yeah So I guess you put this in your own levels or what have you because you can create new, you know Christmas tree looking things and you know everything with the stickers. Hey speaking of stickers When are we going to get that feature where I can uh put photos from the hard drive into the game? Because that's that's the other big thing we're waiting on But it was in an advertisement. It's false advertising bitch wine moan Right, you're never going to get it I wish maybe next year. We'll see Well, this is something that's pretty cool. Um You know, uh on xbox live there was the um, super street fighter 2 turbo hd remix well, um It's uh sold a quarter million. Wow. There's a lot of suckers out there Well, I I have it. I like it. I've got so many different versions of street fighters. Not even funny That's 250 000 people sucking the cock of nostalgia. It's It's basically broken both day one and week one sales records and um Is uh slated to break 30-day sale records as well. So it's supposed to be the the um Oh, actually according to capcom. It's quoted as saying it's honest way to becoming the highest grossing digital title ever Besides that they had the good sense to use udon crew to do their art. So that's pretty cool Very cool they didn't sell one to me well Unfortunately this week there aren't that many choices for you to go purchase stuff. I mean it is the week of christmas and a lot of game publishers aren't exactly putting their games out this week because uh, That's not a lot of time to purchase them. But there are a few that are putting out their games and um, well They're games. All right, um Candace canes candy factory on the ds is coming out this week. Also the sport comic book creator I don't really know if that's a game. That's more software, I think but it's coming out nonetheless. Um, Let's see here Let's see here And Man talk about a short week mystery pi portrait of a thief on ds And I swear that I think that's it that is it that is sad Well, it is kind of a quiet week as well over in japan because they usually get new releases on thursday and what's thursday Oh, yeah christmas So, um on the xbox 360, uh alone in the dark and sid meyers civilization revolution finally come out on the xbox 360 Also On the playstation 3 you also get alone in the dark, uh far cry 2 and bioshock get their japanese translations as well as another port of uh silver revolution, but also some other games white knight chronicles is coming out this week as well as another game I have no idea what this is.

So there you go Um, there were a couple games I missed but I don't know fun fun mini golf on the wii tiki towers on the wii I think those are both download games and then uh horse trainer Horse trainer or dreamer horse trainer and dreamer puppy trainer on ds Sad week in games. Yeah Um also biohazard comes out on the nintendo wii this week and of course that would obviously be resident evil But it's on the wii and I can't figure out like is this the old school? Resident evil being redone because I don't think it's resident evil 4 It must be like from redone port of the first game or something. Uh peakman gets its wii upgrade this week as well Or pickman peakman, whatever. Uh, maybe that's that biohazard zero That might be with uh playstation 2 lego batman comes out this week. And uh, that's about it. Uh on the handhelds You have on the nintendo ds Which I skipped by here on accident you have um Biohazard deadly science. There's deadly science deadly silence gets a price cut Uh, happy my sweets comes out as well this week fantasy star zero comes out on the ds from sega That should be interesting and then on the sony psp Dj max portable, uh black square comes out this week And cherry blossom portable and biohazard degeneration big resident evil week. No, i'm totally jealous my Our branch of my work that's in dallas that houses most of our game reps Genius products is bringing out that game scratched to uh play test for them You know that new djing game that's supposed to be like beatmania. Oh, really? Yeah with the Newmark turntables or something like that. Maybe he gets some pictures or something Yeah, it's only in dallas. They don't give a crap about that stuff. Anyways, that's what pisses me off Because i'm like totally excited to play it. They're like Whatever. All right. Well, let's move on around the world with more releases. Um, Two things for the uk The 23rd is savage moon on playstation 3 and on the 26th boxing day Is 100 classic book collection Yeah It's just not a big week in games. I I reckon not. All right. Well, there you have it We have to do the release dates no matter what even if it's slow week and don't expect next week to be much better Because it's not But you know, it is uh, pretty big the text in banjo kazooie now because uh, There's that brand new patch for those people that own the 14-inch standard definition You know tube tvs You now can read your text in banjo kazooie and suffer through the dialogue of that game So, um, well, thank heavens because you know, I was just waiting for the no, I actually I was just you know, I was just waiting for the no, I actually a lot of people really were waiting for something like this to come out because If you play it on the small tv, this game's next to impossible to play. I'm spoiled with my hd tv. So I need to just Stop taunting those that don't have it Correct. Yeah. All right. Yes. All right. Well, um, we're just about to the end of part a tonight But hey, we've got to uh, take some time to recognize Gaming's classics and that's what we do here in a segment. We call the classic game of the week Oh dark sakura, what have you picked for this very special holiday week for the kids and uh adults out there to recognize? This week in gaming i've picked a bit of the nes and uh, commodore 64 for you. Rob Yay, joy in the form of maniac mansion Maniac mansion Maniac mansion is a weird little game This music's from the nes version yeah But it was originally on the commodore 64 so where um It actually uh is the game that the uh Scum engine was created for the script creation utility for maniac mansion And lucas arts used it for about uh, 10 more years to keep playing it. It also um has chuck the plant in it If anyone has looked at other lucas arts games that that character's in but anyway as the game goes, um There was a purple meteor that made a big crater um on the line of this big mansion that belonged to the edison family and um So basically there were changes in the people that lived there and then uh people that were in uh the Hospital started disappearing. So then there were a bunch of people who uh decided to go into the house because A local cheerleader turned up missing and they decided to go through the entire house, which is like this big movie type horror house thing with um Tentacles and an evil genius and the pool The pool is the best part it has different multi- it has you know multiple endings you can go through depends on who lives who dies You can have a you know, a perfect ending you can have the adversary win you can have um You can have them famous by publishing his autobiography. You can feed them to a plant Um, and um, you can you know, get your players in the game killed and um, it has different red herrings in it and um Just kind of different weird stuff in the game. Um, the different characters in there is you have the sort of James dean type character you have a new wave musician You have a photographer You have a novelist. Um, you have a big nerd who's uh, really scary. YAY NERD! You've got um a punk rock girl You've got um a surfer in there. They all have their different strengths and weaknesses and um I've played this of course on the nes because that's what I had. Um The uh, the different versions there were there were there were the uh, the different versions there were there was also a pc that um also, uh played um There's also the apple 2 the amiga and atari st versions Um, there was the nes versions and instead of it being the full size. They were all kind of sd Super deformed, you know the different characters um And there is actually um an enhanced version with updated graphics that's out and it had a sitcom based on the series Do you ever remember watching? Oh, yeah, I remember that. Oh god, that wasn't on very long But yeah, I remember there was this game was pretty big when it came out and there was a fan Um remake that's called maniac mansion deluxe that runs on windows. Um, the has really um enhanced graphics and music that was actually borrowed from day of the tentacle and um it supposed to fix a lot of uh, Bugs and inconsistencies and they put in some different changes to make it a little bit harder. It's also playable in day of the tentacle maniac mansion Um, and of course then there was it was really really centered though on the nes there were a lot of stuff changed um There um was only one printing of the game um They actually did forget to leave in though some of the more bloody parts like you could still microwave the hamster awesome But the pal version does not have the ability to microwave the hamster. Oh The guy though who um That ported it douglas, uh crockford Put out a memoir that was called the expurgation of maniac mansion Which was, you know, basically him going oh god nintendo you suck um about how strict nintendo was for what they could allow in the game what they couldn't and um About you know some things that he agreed with taking out like edna, you know having sexually themed threats to the characters and different things, um Including the you know, the use of violence non-violence and that type of thing That type of thing um So, um, it was pretty pretty uh Heavily centered like I said, um also, um There like I was saying before it was my favorite part of the game Whenever I would just get really tired of playing it and go to hell with this I would go to the pool drain it and push the red button so that the house would explode I Just what I did every time I was like i'm tired of playing explode game over I didn't think the graphics on the nes version were that great compared to the computer one. No Which is strange because i'm talking about a game on the commodore 64, but The commodore 64 version was actually really nice. I personally did not play it, but I have seen it played Um, because like I said, I didn't have a commodore 64 I had a clicko adam. I have to say though as far as this type of game goes on the nes There is a game. I do prefer these point-and-click games shadow gate Shadow gate was great. Yeah, i'm talking you know You know what part I would always get those stuck at was where you went into the the portal and you had a limited time with your um You had to actually have like some item to make it through the portal You're gonna need to do that in a future week. I'm gonna have to I actually never finished shadow gate, but I love shadow gate but um It's just interesting because you don't think about these point-and-click games a lot on the nes because they they you know But there were some really good ones But um, yeah this it's a really good one, you know also, uh There's some of the uh, lucas arts, uh, i'm just looking at the list of the different lucas arts, uh Um titles that they were supposed to go along with the scum engine And let me get back to that because I was just on it. It was um, I think a couple of monkey island games and uh labyrinth and loom And I think i've covered loom before which is strange because I think loom came out before maniac mansion didn't it? Uh, no, it was after no, no, it was after Strange it was after monkey island even I think But yeah, um some uh, and actually, uh, one of the salmon max games was supposed to use it, but they uh, canceled it It was a salmon max freelance police And full throttle payback was another one But yeah, um some of the different ones that used it was uh, monkey island 2 lachuck's revenge and indiana jones and the fate of atlantis So well there you have it If there's nothing else to add then your classic game of the week is blow up the house maniac mansion on the Maniac mansion on the nes or commodore 64 whatever system you prefer maniac mansion And don't forget to drain the water for the pool and blow up the house That's dark soccer's favorite thing to do, correct? Indeed All right Well, uh, we're going to take a quick break here on orange lounge radio and do some music here And uh when we come back we have plenty more actually, sorry the podcast folks. You won't get to hear the music That's just the way it is, you know copyright rules and everything But uh, we'll be back really soon with more of orange launch radio more stories Hopefully a little bit happier than all the layoff stories we had in uh part a do you think we can arrange that low-key get? Some happier stuff in part. Maybe tonight. All right, we'll try Um, meanwhile, we're gonna go ahead and take a break and we will be right back And welcome back to more of orange lounge radio and this part b of our podcast for this december the 21st Of 2008 and uh, happy holidays to you guys out there listening to the program Uh, we talked a lot about uh different things going on in part a unfortunately a lot of really not so happy Holidays going on for a lot of folks in the game industry And i'm ready to hear that. Uh, we talked also about some other um news including um, Some sales stuff about uh, hg remix and some little big planet updates and some other news coming to the sony world But now we're going to move in and start off tonight talking a little bit about microsoft in part b. Yes, logy. Yes, we are Not exactly great news, but uh microsoft has announced that fable 2's expansion Um, nahole island Not coming out for christmas. Unfortunately, uh was due out this week. It is now being delayed to the end of january Still going to be 10 bucks. Apparently they ran into some unexpected technical difficulties At least they didn't call it balloon nahole island. I mean that would have been really bad Just saying that would be horrible It's why why the delay, um unexpected technical difficulties, whatever that's supposed to mean Uh, everyone took some time off for the holidays. I still don't think it's a good name to name it nahole island anyways, it just Makes me think of like a glory hole or well, haven't you ever heard of what a balloon knot is? That's supposed to be like an asshole because you know what a balloon knot looks like an asshole exactly and this one house in san diego And every time I hear not whole island I keep thinking of a balloon knot hole and it's disgusting i'm like who wants to visit an island With a bunch of assholes. There's a house in san diego that looks like a sphincter Make all the gay jokes you want, but that does not sound appealing. I'm, sorry So there you have it Anyway I'm sorry, i'll move on i'm trying to eat a bagel while i'm talking and making jokes. I need to stop eating cookies Uh tiger claw says every time I hear not whole i'm thinking of sonic am Uh moving on Eight hundred point microsoft point cards now have made their way into the retail marketplace um, apparently, um, you know, you could only get 1600 microsoft points before it was 1999, but now You can get 800 microsoft point cards at retailers for 9.99 And hey, that would be one whole cent cheaper than buying them online. Oh, but you have to pay tax So you're screwed then you have to consider this tax So it's good if you don't like if you want to give a gift or if like, you know, you don't have a credit card And you're a little kid or Or you want to buy it as a gift, but you know, it's it's a stocking stuffer So maybe 20 bucks is too much. I don't know just buy it online Yeah, I guess you know what I want, but they don't world peace. No not world peace screw world peace. Um, But they're not available in most stores is those playstation network cards because I hate the playstation network and how they do their Payments online. Yeah, it's a little silly. I don't like it by the way speaking of playstation network because you brought it up and I forgot to mention earlier in the show we talked about playstation home last week And I said I was going to get an olr club as soon as they open it up Well, I guess I missed it because I went back online later in the week and I saw where you could buy a clubhouse online It was just hard to find Um, i'm not interested in it because you have to invite people into the club and you can only invite up to like 30 people What kind of an olr club is that? Not a cool one, unfortunately, I know we have more than 30 people in our chat room tonight We probably would have more people now than what I do I thought it was something that people would be able to search and go into you know at their leisure But I don't see how it's promotion for the show to do that. It sounds stupid then I'd have to buy all the furniture So forget it Until home gets cooler. I protest. Sorry. Well, there are probably only about 30 of our listeners that actually have a playstation three Yeah, true true Sj100 matt in our chat room wants to point out. Um, I see psn cards in best buy Entertainment says not only that clubs cost money fail. I was willing to like for five bucks I would have done it like it's an experiment. How much was it five bucks five bucks? Okay. Yeah, and I'm still considering it Here right now. It's five bucks with no re no reoccurring fee, but sony is going to implement them at some point You just didn't say what like home doesn't suck enough Do now do we have the trophy rooms and stuff like remember how they're saying? No, nope So like most things it's extremely early like most sony will get i'm sure home will be better in a year But by then we will have all forgot home is extremely late as it is. It's no time for being early. It's late It's Just saying I know all right, sorry we can go back to um, um other stuff now, sorry jamie, okay sega What about them? Well, it looks like um, there's been some esrb, uh Ratings put out so that means that they're going to be a number of games on um xbox live and playstation network from sega There will be um, a sonic 3 comic zone fantasy star 2 and gun star heroes, whoo-hoo which are uh supposed to be uh Out and then um, there were I guess other releases. Um I'm, sorry, uh, the previous releases were sonic the hedgehog sonic 2 golden axe and echo the dolphin and streets of rage 2 Wait a minute, but isn't sega putting out that thing of like 40 games for like 20 bucks or something. Yes Yes, do you think that sega wants as much money as possible? Yes, okay Say yeah, are they giving me anything special? with this I guess and they're going to give you the option to blur it out so that it looks all like, you know hd like Seems kind of just buy the 20 thing when it comes out. Seriously Unless they're not i'm, sorry Which I highly doubt that they are all right, we'll see what happens Something else coming to xbox live arcade kind of interesting I'm, not sure a lot of people are familiar with the um, mmorpg dofus They have a uh Game, I think it's called uh wok fu and now the islands of wok fu are going to be coming to xbox live arcade So it's like an mmo But not you know, it's got the mmo graphics. I guess the perfect example would be like ragnarok online ds You know where it's not technically an mmo game, but you play it similar to the mmo It's just you're not going to be interacting with other people. In fact, that's the tagline. It's like an mmo, but not But um, yeah, it's apparently set a hundred years or a thousand years after wok fu it's due Uh late 2009 and will be an adventure beat them up title As an adventure beat them up and venture beat them up as adventure slash beat them up all style game It says it can be played in a two-player team mode and uh will reveal never before seen background content from the world of dofus and wok fu Really because to me the entire world of dofus and wok fu are unseen and I have not played either one But hey, it's a different type of game and that's always welcome bochi kawa in chat asks wok fu Is that like beating people senseless with a frying pan? Yes, it is exactly now that would be a great game Go around and hit people with a frying pan. Actually, you can kind of do that little big planet. I just want to say uh, hey talking about um Hey other things we might want to hit in the head with a frying pan is uh, whoever caused those xbox 360 discs to scratch Apparently there's some lawsuits going on right now. You know, we reported on those a while ago, but now they're just finally getting around to you know Being looked at investigated what have you and a document in one of the suits was actually unsealed last week Apparently my and what it contains in it is that microsoft actually knew about the problem prior to launch They have multiple options to fix it and the company rejected all of them There were three options apparently listed in the document one of them was a To increase the magnetic field of the disc holder and the reason why they decided to reject that is because it would get in the way Of the disc opening and closing thing. Um, but here's here's where I go crazy when I read that My 360 is having issues when I try to open and close the door on it right now Like sometimes i'll have to hit the button multiple times and i'm starting to worry that the damn thing's about to break on me Have you heard of anything like that loki? no, but I know that the way they have the Eject button and also the um, like power switch and stuff. It's really funky like the power switch There's a little button that's off center on it. So if you push it in the center of your Face plate it won't exactly trigger it every time you kind of push to the right of it So and the way the eject button works is kind of similar It's a little push button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out, but it's kind of like a push button switch It's kind of like a push button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out, but you know You can always if you can't get it to eject that way just you know, hit the middle button and select eject disc Great jrod in chat says I used to have to do that and it ended up where the disk drive wouldn't read anymore lovely Um, remember they won't warranty unless it read rings. So that's when you take a blow torch to it Well, look, there's some other options too The other options were to slow down the disc rotation speed but that was rejected because it would have slowed down the game loading times I think we can understand that one uh, and then um, apparently the other option was to install little bumpers that would have cost the company between 35 to 75 million additional dollars, but I would think little bumpers wouldn't that be like maybe like a buck? a machine Yes, it's it's literally that little um They had a fix a long time ago when people were ready to scratch thing that was available online You'd buy these little um It looked like a cd and you would put it in the drive and kind of push it up and it would stick little Pads on there that would you know keep the disc from jiggling because basically what happens is since the disc has so much play Inside the drive it'll end up, you know bending back to where it rubs up against the laser and that's what carves a nice little You know circle into your disc So this what these do is allows it so that the other side Doesn't tip as much so doesn't ever make contact with the laser Well, here's the thing is that um the and the big thing that the document shows is that microsoft what they eventually decided to do They appended the manual with a warning and offered a disc replacement program You know that was their big fix and I believe something about like a sticker on the door too that you have to pull off That warns them not to tilt the machine when you play Apparently this was deemed insufficient by company employees via an internal email But it's apparently what happened. Anyway, well, it is kind of I mean It's a stupid fix and really they should have just added those little bumpers to it because it wouldn't have cost them 75 million dollars I mean how many consoles they have out there? They have like almost fifteen thousand, you know, fifteen million consoles or not Even really that many but like over ten million consoles. Okay, so You know, they're saying seventy five million dollars. So that's seven fifty per console Um, or no, that's 75 million. That'd be 75 cents per console, basically so Or no my math's all wrong today. Well act whatever it doesn't matter either way It's not gonna cost that much act up in chat says but who the fuck moves around a console when playing a game really? Well, some people own pets like my cat who likes to jump on consoles and um, You know, she may knock it over luckily I'm smart enough to know if the cat's nearby the console. I will lay it flat on the ground instead of you know Tipping up and that's you know, that's a rare occasion, you know, or We just took ours away where she can't get to it. Yeah, I mean it's someone can bump it You know a court get pulled or something knock the console over. I mean, there's all sorts of stuff that can happen It's rare, but there are cases though. I've been hearing where people's discs are just getting in a groove Carved into it just from leaving it Going it's just on you know, the way the laser moves or something that there's some Jittering in there that causes like a ring to kind of carved in over time Not necessarily like where people were tilting the console. It made a nice little like grinding noise Uh, gs68 says microsoft needs to fix the d-pad from hell agreed It's getting to the point where i'm actually considering buying like some games on the ps3 over the xbox 360 completely based on the controller completely based on the controller Completely based on the controller whatever happened to that controller that was supposedly coming out that had a better d-pad I never saw that and why they would do that for a limited amount of time is retarded That's a very good question. I I have no idea why they would do that. Uh, and tiger claw wants to say, um, Well, he says a couple things He says it's a conspiracy microsoft knew all along with the disk scratch problem before the public found out I smell a class action waiting to happen. Actually. It's already happening That's where these documents came out of but then he goes on to say microsoft needs to fix the tray eject problem A lot of people are experiencing it. I'm not the only one And bobby blackwolf wanted to work in a cheap plug for his upcoming new show He said the first episode of friday night gaming will address that issue directly on stage with a company that repairs consoles Apparently one little shtick they're going to do on their show is actually repair consoles live on air On his little friday night show he's starting I believe the 9th of january is the first episode Straight out straight out of atlanta or I have a console that's under repairables What because i've tried repairing it really remember that should be a challenge that I took a heat gun to you Should see if bobby will take it on bobby and his friends. It can be fixed. I'm sure if they re-bulb the um GPU on it, but I don't have the device to do it. Let alone the patience or the skill necessary It's gonna be like trauma center for consoles. That's gonna be amazing So check that out friday night Fnglive.net if I don't say the website then bobby will say I hate him. All right Let's move on with more news. We'll see what happens in further developments with the uh disc scratching Oh, hey, no, we're not gonna move on with more news We don't want to do any more news. We're done. We're out of here.

They aren't likely to look for it. Frankly. I have no faith in them My counseling agency has been has been helpful as a wet fart read. Not at all You'd think that since the theft occurred there that they'd be eager to have this issue resolved just to cover their collective asses but it looks like that isn't the case as Oh, I lost my place actually as a related note And if I neither mentioned it in the call, or you haven't figured it out already. I bought my ps I brought my ps3 to my counseling agency for an informal party. I was supplying the entertainment movies downloaded on psn karaoke rock band guitar hero world tour style Etc. It was stolen between 12 15 p.m. And 1 15. Um p.m. Est. Wouldn't that be am Um, oh no, i'm misreading it on uh est on 11 19 when it was unattended in all likelihood I won't be getting my original system back, which is a shame I had the 60 gigabyte model which are impossible to find not only that but I upgraded the internal. Um htd And bought a ton of stuff off of the psn store anywho luckily my ssi payee is sitting on my rainy day fund And sent her request for the adequate funds to replace the system with a used 80 gigabyte model And the same type of upgraded hdd that I had before i'll worry about the movies and tv shows that I bought at a later Time and date. Sorry for the long as hell email. Trust me. It's not and I figured that you'd appreciate an update. Take care Well, thanks for letting us know well stolen systems suck and whoever stole your system needs to die in a fire and let's just hope That karma comes around and bites this person in their big fat ass Next email next email j-rod Hey folks I haven't heard the last show but I don't know if this has been asked if it has please disregard But if you could ask santa for one gaming related christmas present and don't worry about price santa is bringing it What would it be mine would be a new computer to play left for dead because I can't even run the original halo This email is sponsored by the olive garden home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks you first Um, I don't know if it's gaming related, but I would like a new computer Well, see I have a new computer for the gaming but I would just like a whole new like setup for the show I'd like like a fancy new mix board Um an easier way to publish a show on a faster computer without having to transfer to my new one Which has kind of been slowing things down technically gaming related.

Uh-huh. I have my world cup soccer Can you believe that dan actually asked me if I would trade it temporarily? Okay, i'm gonna go I can't go on a completely like random tangent for a minute for it Okay, here's the thing it is related though. Um, I on twitter I follow some other podcasters some other indie podcasters and one of the podcasters I follow is one of the guys from video game outsiders And he posted a youtube today. I guess he picked up some new. Um Popeye machine or something. I guess what he does. He has like like how you amass a bunch of pinball machines in your house He amasses a bunch of 80s, uh stuff in his basement Not a bunch of babies Hey, I found this baby at the mall No, i'm gonna take it home and raise it to do my work. No, you stop trying to start a podcast war I could just see it now dude the guy I can see they're gonna read an email on the show the guys from olr said you have babies in your basement What do you have to say about that they're crunchy No, no, no, but he's got like all these old school 80s machines I was like, oh cool cool and like, um, you know, I was I was looking at the pop I wanted but I went to his youtube channel because I was like I wonder if he shows off other stuff like this and he does and one of the youtubes that he had Was him getting his new baby pac-man machine And I have to admit it's the first time i've ever really watched something like that another podcaster did where I was completely Overcome with jealousy like just total jealousy. I was looking at it going That is so cool. I am so fucking jealous. I want I want one of those fuckers so badly Even the baby pac-man sort of sucks ass It does novelty. It's it's the novelty of the only successful incarnation of video and pinball has been pinball 2000 Really? So there you go God now they're gonna get I can just see it now who said you keep babies in your basement No, it's baby pac-man that he had in his basement that I was completely And utterly overcome with jealousy. Yeah babies I mean if I could find one of those machines cheap, you know, I would put that shit in this garage You wouldn't find one cheap. Good luck unless it's completely destroyed and gutted. I know last email dan Come fix my baby pac-man because I don't know dick about pinball games Last email. Okay. Hey, olr. It's from cheeseburger, by the way Well me being the huge star crash fan as I am I never started playing world of warcraft because I would become addicted Well yesterday I went to my friend's house and he started a free trial of wow He had 256 megabytes of ram out of the two gigabytes recommended So I started a trial on my laptop because it has one gigabyte of ram so he could play Without much lag while I was there Well, I got home and started playing for a few hours. So my question is for sky what server or whatever it is You it's called do you play on I play on the garithos. Did I spell that right? Right server i'm level nine and I wanted to know if it's worth buying and if I can switch server to play on with you Also, tell me a little about the game and some of the things that will convince me to buy it I'm going to give you an answer You weren't expecting because if I remember right cheeseburgers like 15 years old 14 15 like he's a younger listener of ours My advice to you is not to buy world of warcraft Because you're still in school and if you get sucked into a game like world of warcraft, um, it could affect your school Here's the thing if you know in your heart and in your gut in your mind You can restrict yourself to playing this game one or two hours a day tops Then it might be okay, but honestly, it's the social element That's what really these games are all about I mean I could describe all about like the quest and the classes and the magic and all this stuff But you know what? You're playing the game. You see all that firsthand The reason why people get addicted to this stuff is the social element. It's logging It's it's you know, when I log on to the game and I say hello to the guild everybody goes rob, you know It's like walking into cheers the bar and everybody yells norm. It's it's that kind of thing That's that's the reward that you're going to get out of a game like warcraft. Um that being said I play on the server raven crest and if you want more information, it's all in our forms That's a cheap plug for the forms And that way people who only really really want it will get it But yeah, it's kind of I know i'm like such an addict of the game. But you know Uh, i'm also not in school And uh, sometimes even I have to really limit myself on how much i'll play Yeah, that's actually sort of a reason why I have I really Am loath to get back into world of warcraft myself It's because I know how little time i'll have to play except like maybe on a weekend and then when you're still enjoying Ragnarok the thing that sucks too is that if you get far behind the rest of your guild you start to feel like You're just out of it. You know what I mean? So that's you know, the competition's a lot. So There you go. That's that's my honest advice Ta-da, so that was it for emails I said that didn't I? All right. Sorry. Well, I wasn't listening surprised gee rob. All right. I don't listen to this show I just talk on it All right. That's it for emails. If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange launch radio.com We'll get some more stuff from you later during the skype line Even though I don't know how long we can go tonight because it's fucking freezing out here in the garage But we will get some more stories first. It's not as cold as it was last week. It's still pretty fucking cold It's still pretty fucking cold. I love this quilt. Oh, it's so cold. All right, uh logi, um, there's rumors that the uh PSP is getting another revision. Uh, the PSP 4000 is apparently due out late 09 This is coming to us from Eurogamer that reports their publishing sources Indicate that uh Sony is planning on doing this and eventually will launch a PSP 2 I mean, I think it's a no-brainer that they're eventually going to launch some sort of portable gaming system later on, you know Update the hardware that kind of makes sense um, and it wouldn't you know be a surprise if they Fix some more stuff on the PSP again But of course Sony is saying they have no plans for a PSP 2 Where have I heard we have no plans for something before? Oh, I know on every other rumor that they have no plans on like no plans for a pice cut no plans on releasing a 160 Gigabyte system no plans for doing something that it's completely obvious no plans to release a good system We have no plans on ever becoming the number one console again So when you hear no plans Hear them saying it's like we are, you know, so yeah, just Big deal. We know hardware revisions coming. Not a big surprise A sequel to a popular handheld system might happen you think? Hello. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought Hey, uh moving on over to Nintendo who has been number one lately Although amongst the hardcore gamers, uh, some of us are starting to feel a little jaded I don't know. This is something that some hardcore gamers will be into but probably more for the casual crowd and the young folks Um, some of the early 2009 releases for Nintendo, of course headlined by Pokemon Platinum on March 22nd That is going to be a pretty big title on the Nintendo DS even though isn't it just the last two Pokemon? It's it's just like they do this all the time They release, you know, like, you know red and blue and then there's yellow that has something special, you know It's it's it's just I think there's supposed to be new pokemons in this one All right, then again and it also has some weird like uh level structures and stuff. It's like kind of neat looking interesting Um some other games that are coming out, uh Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echo of Time is supposed to actually come out this spring So we'll see what happens with that. Um, let's see. What else is supposed to come out here? I've got like a whole list um That is spring that they said that game would come out March. Yeah, probably the later the better, um For them not drag quest five Is that on That's on DS. No, I don't see it listed in their list not in the first three months of the year Oh really be a little later. No, unless it hasn't been announced yet. I don't know I'm trying to look at some first part Let's see Sega's putting out the house of the dead overkill on Wii in February Sonic and the black knight in March and mad world in March Ubisoft's got Tenchu in February and broken sword shadows the Templars in March Nintendo, first party games, the only stuff they're putting out Mario power tennis in March and Pikmin in March That's it on the Wii. Yeah on the Wii However on the DS from Nintendo personal trainer math on January 12th Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon on February 16th and the before mentioned Pokemon Platinum Which is kind of in line with their one title a month Konami however is putting out the new Elibits game the adventures of Kai and Zero is coming out first quarter of uh, The new year the suikoden tactical game suikoden tear crease is coming out on in the first quarter as is little magicians magic adventure all those from Konami And then I'm trying to see Ubisoft has a bunch of games coming out imagine cheerleader imagine family doctor imagine ice champions And American pop star road to celebrity what an awesome year it's turning out to be For the Nintendo DS. Did you see what they named those? You remember the play on the Wii games new play control Yeah That's a retarded name. Just call it like I don't know cash cow Pikmin I do want to point out Konami is putting out a game on the Wii that some of you guys might care about ddr Disney grooves For those that are still playing ddr after all these years. There you go Ssh 100 matt in chat says factor 5 goes down, but sonic team is still around. Where's the justice? Where's the justice? That's that for first quarter lineup Well, how about something very cool for all of our? 8-bit fans which by the way, thank you for the old school Nintendo entertainment system dar Sakura's kind of like a second Christmas gift slash late birthday gift. Well also thanks sauce for Thank you sauce to the trade for agreeing to a trade that I got the better end of the deal of Well, um, if anyone who is a big Nintendo fan, this is especially cool. Also, it's really cool for the fans of pac-man champion Edition, it's been remade for the Nintendo entertainment system It actually is fully functional actually just like the same. It looks pretty damn cool Looking at a video here on this site. Sorry. That's what you're hearing in the background I'm looking at a video here on this site. Sorry. That's what you're hearing in the background Interesting looking I don't know. It seems like it's a hacked ROM of some sort because the music in the background is strange Right, it doesn't sound like pac-man at all. Anyway, there you go. That's that's what it sounds like It might be trying to emulate the music from hmm, maybe well at any rate. Um, you um There's no idea where you can find the ROM. It's from the pac-mania soundtrack. Oh, is it? Oh Sorry, if that was loud guys, it wasn't loud to us in the studio, but I guess it came out very loud over the um, But hey whoever whoever finds it then let me know what you think of it. So cool Yeah, apparently the weird thing about this is that it's it's still unknown if this is like real or a concept thing Because no ROM has showed up out there Who knows That's the weird thing about it. Is it like it's not something you can actually like download for use in an emulator But they say it's an actual 8-bit nintendo game I don't know Um a game that is coming out on the ds, uh grand theft auto chinatown wars has been dated now for um march Which is weird because I thought it was dated before for january, but either way it's coming out now march 17th grand theft auto chinatown wars and uh will feature most of liberty city um I think they're cutting out all their need from um grand theft auto 4 but most of it and it's going to kind of look a little bit like um The old grand theft auto 1 and 2 games, you know kind of a top-down 3d Type of game and it's all cel-shaded but still violent and pretty cool looking Yay, cool looking things Europe will be getting the game three days later on march 20th Well, that's good that it's not getting delayed so bad. Yeah And I can't wait to try the online multiplayer. That'd be fun Of course tons of people be cheating in it because they can i'm sure Okay, so, um, here's something interesting going on I don't I don't know what the hell you want to call this But I don't know if you've heard about this project. It's called bob's game And it's this guy who's spent a lot a lot of time making a particular ds home brew project He's apparently going on protests He's going to be spending 100 days locked in his room locked and barricaded from the outside to protest how nintendo has been treating his project Here's the thing he needs a ds software development kit to get his game which is um I guess what bob made is some type of like 2d adventure thing. It looks really cool He actually wants to sell it as a retail game, but nintendo will not give him one Even though bob has apparently talked to nintendo done the application told he was going to get an answer in a few months And apparently 17 weeks have come by no answer. No kid has showed up However, now what he's going to be planning is his 100 day sit down protest. So he's doing a tantrum Basically, he's throwing a fit fucking grow up Well, he's been giving the run around with you know stuff and his game does look really cool Um, that's kind of too bad, you know Unfortunately, i'd be hitting up other publishers or whatever and see if they can publish your game or there's more. I gotta read all this Um, apparently he met with nintendo in february about a year ago to ask for the kit He teleconferenced he flew to game developers conference and had a face-to-face meeting Uh, he talked to the wario world division who sent him to marketing He talked to marketing and they sent him back to the wario world division Uh on the application it said it would be six to eight weeks for a decision. It's been 17 He says he's met all the requirements He's a financially stable registered company with an fein which I believe is a federal identification number. I'm working from a commercial address Um, and he says that when nintendo decides to approve the developer license, he will end his protest Apparently you can actually watch on live webcam. I'm actually going to go to the site right now It looks like he's asleep, but you can see something on the board right now says reggie on the monitor there and uh, it is Yep, it's actually his live confinement right now, but it looks like he's fast asleep or something or he left the room But he's on day 12 He's not supposed to leave the room. He's not it says he sleeps behind the camera. Oh Where's his potty i'm assuming I hope that's all behind the camera too or something But anyway, um, he says he cannot leave the room the door is locked and barricaded from the outside He's sleeping behind the camera. Yes. There is a shower food is being delivered once a week by a friend There is no internet access television or game consoles besides the ones he's developing on He can receive and send email on his cell phone so he can get nintendo's reply and update the site And the led counter will be incremented once a day. Sometimes it will display hints and secret messages So, yes jamie he's throwing a tantrum Is doing the equivalent of sticking his fingers in the in his ears and closing his eyes going lala Well still though what about the point that he's meeting all of nintendo's requirements and nintendo's dicking him What what about that to play devil's advocate? We need more imagine games We don't have time with this good adventure crap need more imagine and more pets if it's got imagine and pets in it we can definitely do something with it. Oh, and if it's a sim. More sim games. SSJ100Matt says, Rob, you need to get an interview with this guy. I don't know if I can. He has no phone, right? I can't, oh no, he has a cell phone. Maybe I can. I guess I could try sending an email. I don't know. Misty in chat says, there's better ways to bitch about it. Like not eating. Fasting. Like sending duty to Reggie. Hunger strike? Yes, a hunger strike. That's what I was looking for. I am not on a hunger strike. I was shoving my mouth full of food. I'm on a food strike where I do nothing but eat food. That's my response. All right. Redertainment says, imagine Bob's pet sims adventure. Amazing. All right, so good luck Bob on your protest, I guess. Um, don't die. Geez. Just kind of fucking ridiculous. And by kinda, I mean really. Well, this is very, very happy, happy news for me. Because I have been wanting this game, and I played the other two, and it's freaking beautiful. But Klonoa Door to Phantom Isle is going to be coming out in North America. And that makes me giddy. And it's supposed to be out in Spring 2009. And it's supposed to be keeping the original design because everybody said they wanted it. And the North American version will have some gesture controls. Basic control though is be triggered to grab your enemies and flick the Wiimote to throw. Which is kinda cool. Um, it has an NES style Wiimote using the GameCube controller. And the classic controller is also, uh, you can use that too. And, uh, there is a rumor that the Klonoa 2 remake is on its way. Klonoa 2 is freaking hard. But I really, really, really, really, really love Klonoa. Maybe this took so long to come out in the US because the Klonoa developers locked themselves in a room for 100 days until Nintendo agreed to put out their game. Just sayin'. Hmm. Well, um, you know, after much begging and pleading, apparently EA has decided to graciously allow players to be able to reinstall their copies of Spore after uninstalling it. They can now download a tool from EA that will let you deauthorize your PC and effectively allow you to override the game's install-on-five-PCs limit, as you can manage the availability of all five machine slots. Hooray. But unfortunately there's not a tool that's gotten me back interested in Spore again, to which actually my cat knocked a disk on the floor in its case, and I was like, eh, it's a good place for it. Nice. So do you let the cat rearrange all your furniture? She does that on her own. She decides that she wants to cram herself in the tiny space that is between my monitor on the shelf and the top of my desk. It's, like, less than, you know, about six inches tall, but somehow she decides that she wants to cram herself in there. But cats are cute, so she gets away with it, right? Yeah, unfortunately she does. What's your cat's name again? Stella. Stella. That's right. Uh, hey, um, the RIAA. Apparently some kitties, some cute kittens went into the RIAA office and just, they made them go, aw, and shucks, because they decided to do something nice this holiday season. They are no longer going to sue individual file sharers or harass universities anymore. Woo! That's our deadly war music! Hold up, hold up. Instead, what the RIAA plans to do is that they are going to report people that they suspect of copyright infringement directly to the ISPs. The ISPs will then investigate the customers and either issue a warning or implement restrictions, whatever they decide is needed. Apparently what the benefit will be to the ISPs, the participation is voluntary, but they'll be able to better control the congestion on their networks by applying this new little policy. Some words from Ars Technica on the original report of this. Suddenly, ISPs gained a tremendous new tool. One study in the UK showed that most people sharing music would stop when made aware that their activity was being tracked and that they were not, in fact, anonymous. Should that hold true in the US, ISPs would presumably see massive decreases in P2P traffic. The customer notifications can be blasted out by email, making the whole process quick and easy for ISPs. As is usual for these sorts of schemes, questions still remain about what sorts of judicial processes will be in place to contest notifications and penalties, and what happens to a household internet connection when Dad finds his access cancelled, even though he's never shared a file in his life. Yeah, whatever. It's not going to work very well, but hey, you know, whatever. So pirate away, everybody! Pretty much. Just kidding. You shouldn't pirate, because that's why all these people got laid off this week, so yeah. It was all your fault. Yeah, it's the RIAA's coming after you for music. So, stop downloading... I wonder if there's any companies that are going to say, nope, we're not participating. Go fuck yourself. Yes, stop downloading music and start downloading movies. J-Rod in chat says, I got a letter from my ISP about downloading HBO shows. It didn't stop my torrenting. Well, I've never received any kind of cease and desist, so... The only letters I received from my ISP is, we're raising your rates. It's like, thanks. You know, and if you're downloading TV shows, I mean, they were on TV... I don't get it. Well, some other very interesting news. Let's move away a little bit from the RIAA bastards. EA and Steam have decided to make sweet love. So there's going to be EA games that are available through Steam's service, which is Mass Effect, Need for Speed Undercover, and Spore, and the Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack, FIFA Manager 09, and Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning. So that's going to be hanging out there. So they're getting steamy? They're getting steamy. Also, others slated for there is Mirror's Edge Command and Conquer, Ad Alert 3, and Dead Space. But not mix steamy, or else the RIAA might sue them for sharing ABC shows. What? Nothing, never mind. If you didn't get that joke, good for you. Who in this room doesn't watch TV? Oh, that's me. Even you watch some TV. You just don't watch TV, like, on TV. I watch DVDs after the fact. There you go. I will going to be watching a show as soon as it's got new episodes on, when it airs. See, American Idol. Supernatural. What if there's David Cook 2 on American Idol next year? No. Will you watch that? And keep in mind, I watched American Idol through YouTube. Well this year they're actually getting rid of, or they're limiting the amount of the bad singers that they have on the show. After that I say, great, another show I don't have to watch anymore. So apparently, you know, Crackdown 2 is a game that I wish would come out, because Crackdown 1 was awesome, and it does need a sequel. But of course, you know, Real Time Worlds, they're busy working on the game that I'm going to have to get back into MMOs for, and that would be APB. But until that happens, people still wish for Crackdown 2. Well, there was a rumor that Crackdown 2 was actually being developed by another company, Ruffian Games, however, that may not be the case anymore. The studio head, Colin McDonald, actually said, you know, they would like to make the sequel for Crackdown, although to date they have not been offered for Microsoft for Crackdown sequel. They are having ongoing discussions with them, and they would feel really hurt if Microsoft went to some other studio to develop it. Wasn't there rumors that that's exactly what Microsoft did? Yeah, there was, but they don't know. They said that they would doubt that Microsoft would choose a startup, I guess it says a startup on RTW's doorstep, Ruffian, I don't know why they would choose them, I guess. Jay Roddon in chat says, Crackdown, oh, you meant that bonus disc that came with the Halo 3 beta? Yes, that's the one. The game is awesome, okay, seriously. Way better than the Halo 3 beta. It wasn't bad, it wasn't bad. I probably played, actually, in reality, I probably did play more Crackdown than I did Halo 3, and I didn't even know the game. Crackdown was awesome. It was crack. Down. Down. One more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to get into some last minute stories in the Skype line, and this is filed under kind of a little bit of WTF. Xbox Live, you know, XNA has really opened it up in the whole community games thing for people to make literally anything, and that is exactly what's happened, is literally anything has popped up now in the store. It's a game, quote, fireplace, and what it does, it makes all the sights and the sounds of a winter fireplace via your Xbox 360 on the television. It's like one of those, like, you remember the old cassette tapes that was just nothing but the fire that you could play in the background during Christmas? That's basically what this is. Don't you mean a videotape? Huh? Don't you mean a videotape? Yeah. But what did they call it, like a virtual yule log or something like that? Virtual fireplace. I don't know what they call it. They still have those, and they actually have Blu-rays now of virtual fireplaces. People buy this shit. That's the amazing thing. We should make the official OLR yule log and just make tons and tons of money off people's impulse buys. I don't know. Kind of crazy. Apparently, you can get the demo on your Xbox 360, and you can even get that on the internet. Just download it right away, and you can get like a little four-minute demo, but here's the thing. If you want the full version, it's 400 points. Now I'm not going to give this guy a lot of shit because having talked to Aaron on a previous show who made Snake 360 and talking to the community developers, I think there's a certain range of points that they can charge, and so probably 400 is like all this guy can't charge. I don't know. I don't know if he can charge less. No. No? 200. I have some for 200. Let's see. Hold on. I want to look at some video of this thing in action here. Let's see. I'm going to actually play a little video. Yep. That is definitely a virtual log. To be honest, you could probably purchase a DVD for cheaper than five bucks. Yeah, you could probably go to the 99 Cents store and get one of these DVDs. The 99 Cents store has some pretty funny movies there. In fact, that'd be really fun to make stocking stuffers with the 99 Cents clearance center movies. Awesome. There's some absolute crap. It's awesome. That's... God, you don't even press a button. It would be awesome if you pressed a button and you could throw a kitten in the fire and watch what happens. A kitten? I'm just kidding. That's wrong. No, I'm kidding. It is wrong, but funny. A reindeer. That's more festive. Or Santa. You just watch Santa dropping the chimney into the fire. See, that would be worth 400 points. Or Christmas lemmings. As Dark Tetsuya in Chat says, or a ferret. There you go. Tiger Claw says, there's even an app on the iPhone and iPod touch of a virtual fireplace for only 99 cents. I got a Zippo lighter one for free. All right, we're going to go to some last minute stories from Loki and then we'll take some calls on our Skype line. Well, there's been some new patches for some PC games. Darkrai 2 got a patch to fix their widescreen issues. Apparently it had the same thing that was wrong with Bioshock with it. They were kind of letterboxing it in the reverse, I guess. But now that's fixed, so yay. And well, other things. Sony is claiming that they're going to get rid of their clamshell packaging. They are working to, I guess, go greener and they actually promoted their little announcement with a crappy video that's called Sony declares death to the clamshell. And it was awful. And I highly recommend that you don't watch it. And other than that, not a whole lot else going on, man. It's like, talk about slow going. Well, it is Christmas week for heaven's sake, but hey, or well, you know, coming up, but I am so excited about the clamshell news because I think those, that packaging is horrible evil stuff. I, oh, oh, grrr. Clamshell packaging can go die in a fire. I'm really excited to hear that's, I want to press a button and watch all my old clamshell packaging get burned in the fire. Cause that annoys me. All right, we're taking your calls 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on orange or her username on Skype is orange lounge radio. I've been doing this a little bit too long. Can you believe next week is our last show of 2008 and then we will go into the year 2009, which would be our seventh year of podcasting. If you could believe it or seventh year of doing this show, I guess podcasting has been around seven years, but you know what I mean? Crazy stuff. We're getting old. We're getting old next year. One of us will kill another live on air. Just wait for it. Stay tuned. Would you spend $5 for a yule log game on the 360 where you could throw clamshell packages into the fire? I might. I just might be willing to spend that kind of money. Except you wouldn't because you'd have to use the D pad to do that. And yeah. All right. I'm going to the chat or I'm sorry, the phone. That's getting late and I haven't even cracked open the eggnog yet. Hi, you're on orange lounge radio. Who's this? Legend of Zaku. Hey, Legend of Zaku. What's up? Nothing much. You know, today's my birthday, right? Or for the next less than 40 minutes. Well happy Hanukkah and birthday. Not Jewish. That's all right. You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate Hanukkah. I get gelt. I love those potato latkes though. Hell yeah. One of my friends was supposed to make me some of those. That sounds delish. Sorry, the house is turning into Silent Hill here. The door just blew open into the house and it's kind of creepy because of all the wind blowing outside and the storms. Maybe in our seventh year of podcasting, Pyramid Head will rape us all live on air. Yikes. Nice. All right. What's on your mind, Zaku? Nothing much. Just trying to scurry up as much money as possible to get me something, at least one game for Christmas since the last game I bought was GTA 4 back in May, like April or May. It's been a while. I mean, I'm unemployed right now, I'm trying to find work and I can't be pissing my money away on unnecessary things like that when the bills have to be paid first and foremost. I heard that Prince of Persia dropped in price the 40 bucks. Where at? Everywhere. PC? What, for PC? No, for PS3 and Xbox 360. See, I'm trying to give my PC some love. I was going to ask, what one game are you thinking of buying because you must have something in mind. Left 4 Dead. Left 4 Dead. Ah, Left 4 Dead. Why Left 4 Dead? Well, because that's just like playing Half-Life with zombies but with at least subpar storyline with it and I get to use my keyboard and mouse. Nice. Very cool, very cool. I've heard a lot of good things about Left 4 Dead but I think that's another one of those games that I won't probably actually get to check out until next year just because I'm playing so much other crap like, wow. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry to hear about the financial tough times but, you know, it's something a lot of people are going through. I mean, I have plenty of money saved up. I'm not worried about, you know, the bills but, you know, I can't burn that money that quickly. That money has to last me until I find work. Right. No, that's understandable. Mm-hmm. So, well. Yeah, I mean, I mean, other companies are struggling. I mean, you already had like two or, like about two or three companies going under in one week. Six. Six, well, not necessarily going under but doing layoffs. Six companies doing some type of closure or cutbacks this week. I know, I know Factor 5 and I think Free Radical went belly up. Yeah, we reported on it. I don't know if you were here at the very beginning of the show but we kicked off the show. Factor 5, EA, Midway, Free Radical, Asper and Turbine all did some type of closure or layoff this week. Looks like someone's not having a Christmas party this year. No, and it sucks. It's really too bad. It's really too bad. Well, you used to work in like cell phone games and stuff. Yes, I do. Are you surprised? And then this time last year I had a really nice Christmas party complete with like all you can eat stuff, open bar, you know, Guitar Hero, SingStar right there on a big, you know, on a nice big projection. Are you surprised by what's happened? I mean, it's shitty all around. It's like, you know, ask anybody, I bet you know at least 3 or 4 or 5 people that you know personally that are probably unemployed right now and are struggling to find work in this economy. I mean, I have so many skills right now. My experience is that I'm trying my best to secure work but it's a clusterfuck because I'm not the only one fighting for that same job. It's like hundreds upon thousands of other people fighting for that same position, especially here in New York. It is very, very tough out there right now. It's very tough. You're lucky you still have work whereas, you know, I had to work as a contractor, you know, since early this year since I got laid off from my full-time job. And so, you know, I was connected and I had resources but they ran out over the summer. Oh no, I'm thankful to have a job. You know, I stopped bitching about the promotion I was supposed to get because a while ago they were trying to give me a promotion to work and I stopped bitching about it for now because I realized that, you know, I should just be lucky to have a job right now so I'm just going to shut up. Yeah. It's better to have a job, you know, better to be working than not be working at all like me right now. Yeah. So, well, Zaku, best of luck in your search, maybe for your birthday, somebody will give you a new job. Well, hopefully if you want, you know, I could give you my resume, see what you could do with it. But then again, I live out, you know, here in New York so it wouldn't make any sense if I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all. Okay. Which unfortunately, I don't think I have the money to do right now. What the crap happened there? We got like bad echo and Skype. That was awesome. I think closed on me. That was weird. Okay. Wow. I swear we didn't do any thing. What the crap was that? Skype just crashed on us in studio. We got the error message and that happened. What the? robot okay first no dude this is like the beginning of a scary movie right here first we had the door blew open then we have uh... something happened with zaku on the skype line there what the shit i'm scared to take another call let's see what happened i don't think it was anything you did zaku sorry about that that's but i didn't do anything either that's a weird thing this is crazy let's take one more call hi uh... i saw something come up and i got excited are you going to sleep jamie? goodnight jamie dark knight is going to sleep hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this is dark knight y'all must had a one miss call moment hi dark knight what's on your mind buddy y'all must had a one miss call moment or something when that happened uh... it was it's very weird i don't know what the hell's going on with skype we'll see maybe i need to upgrade but i thought i just upgraded last week but whatever what's on your mind buddy uh... talking about the layoffs and what not free radical i got free radical i can understand them shutting their doors and what not cause like i said they had one bus game and whatnot it didn't really do much for really make much money for them at all and what not well yeah i mean you know it's still unfortunate they won't get a chance to do a second one you know what i mean that's true and they said they were working on the time splitter game right yeah so i mean i can understand that as far as mid weighting them doing layoffs and what not that one kind of hard to swallow because i mean the latest mortal kombat and what not they've been making their money off of that i did see the mortal kombat team was left intact mortal kombat team was left intact ok yeah mid weights kind of had a rough year outside of mortal combat Mortal Kombat you know we don't really know how the other games is selling yet but some of their other high-profile titles did not follow through the way they should and to be honest I can't think of a lot of Midway games I've gotten really excited about this year which is kind of a bummer but you know yeah I thought I would hear people talk about Blitz but I don't even think I heard people was talking about Blitz and everything like that no no but then EA I mean EA is kind of you know their year hasn't been that terrible yet they did a lot of layoffs too so it's kind of that's and that is a big shocker to hear that EA I figured I made comment earlier saying that if one of the big comp big game manufacturing companies did have any issues had layoffs did we really be scratching our heads if anything else it would be interesting to see if Nintendo say or not say a Nintendo Sony or Microsoft gets any brunt of this but I wouldn't think so because Nintendo they don't have a lot of workforce here you know compared to what they have over in Japan same with Sony and then Microsoft you know I i you know they're doing pretty well for themselves and Microsoft and so you know especially companies like Microsoft and Sony really have much more than just well then again last week we talked about layoffs to Sony didn't we so I guess maybe the Big 3 aren't infallible Governments entertainment oh thank you it's from general the general company I don't think it was for entertainment division but at least Microsoft Sony you know they have all those other divisions their company they're huge huge companies not just about the games still right still still and I mean it just and then you think about it then Sega is like Sega having their bad luck streak with their games and whatnot all the Sonic games and whatnot then find out problems with problems with their online gaming division and stuff like that I'm like here we go If Sega were to go then I'd be a lost sheep you know I would cry with you it's just it's not just that but just that all these companies are getting swallowed up by other companies too you know what I mean yeah like um Koei and um Tecmo tried to go over combinations that coming up when companies that join forces and whatnot try to save money yikes yikes scary scary times well Dark Knight anything else on your mind before we let you go tonight I just want to wish our guys a happy holidays and be safe and enjoy your presents everything like that and we will do and see y'all in note 9 I'm gonna play with my pest dispenser just open close open
