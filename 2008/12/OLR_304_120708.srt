00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that video game show dedicated to all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ah! Ah! Ah! You're back, welcome back!

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I am! Alright! And what an amazing two weeks off it's been! I know, don't rub it in! Not really!

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You've had all this time off, no I'm just kidding. We are a little late tonight in starting the show, this won't affect anybody listening to this on the podcast

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Except for the fact that the podcast has been going up extremely late lately. That's because we're all pregnant.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But no, we're not all pregnant!

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let me introduce Tech Master Loki, who I hope is not pregnant, Jesus. Are you pregnant, Loki?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No, I am not.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Welcome Tech Master Loki. We're starting a little late tonight, 7 o'clock Pacific, just because there's personal life things going on that have to, real life, greater than gaming

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Rob has PMS

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, I have PMS, and I'm having a baby.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Alright, also say hello to a special guest we have here tonight, Jamie has brought one of her friends here to giggle with us tonight on the show

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Say hello to Becky!

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Greetings.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hello, do you have an online name you use, Becky, that you want people to call you?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Uh, Beckers.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Beckers! I like that. Beckers! It makes me think of Beckum.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Alright, Beckers. Anyhow...

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, but he married a hoochie.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Posh Spice is pretty hot.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a hoochie!

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Anyway, Beckers!

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Her boobs don't move!

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Beckers, what type of video games do you enjoy? Do you play a lot of video games? What do you like?

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Really only Rock Band and Karaoke Revolution.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The hell else do you need right about now?

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I have really bad tinnitus, so if I try to hold controllers, badness ensues, and then I cry.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You know what though? Nothing wrong with the music game love. We love music games here at Orange Mountains Radio. It's our roots.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So we'll definitely be talking more about Rock Band later on. We've got some stories tonight about Rock Band.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Before we get there, we've got to talk about our gaming week. So let's talk about a dark soccer. How was your gaming week?

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I refuse.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Refuse?

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm kidding.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How dare you refuse?

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I played some Rock Band. I've been playing Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, and I'm very pissed off at it right now, so I took a break.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Because it's fucking hard!

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, it is. I had the same problem.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to actually go back and re-level just on that first thing, just because. It's such a pain in the butt. And I got Animal Crossing, and I have been beating my animals with a bug net.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Awesome.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But I accidentally stole my shovel, and stupid Nook, that butthead, won't get anyone in.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know, I was telling Nelly because there's this one stupid rabbit in her town named Francine.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I know which one that is!

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes, that she absolutely hates. I said that we have to form a hit squad, and just have everybody with bug nets all of a sudden chase her down, like get her trapped in one of those pitfalls, and just all four people hitting her at the same time.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That would be hilarious.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you know who fucking showed up in my village?

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Who?

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Pearl. I hate her. She's a little cat that looks like, oh god, she looks like she has like burn scars all over her face.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Guess who's in my village?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wolfgang.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He's fucking awesome.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can't believe we're having this discussion about a game made for 12 year olds.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Guess what? I got a buddy in my town.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I want the lesbian to move back into my town.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What was her name? Was that Barbara? No, Barbara was a sheep.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
She was a duck, I think, and had gym equipment in her house, so we put rainbow signs outside of her house.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And she was our, we put all kinds of happy signs and sent her letters, and the bitch moved out.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Was it Pauline Hall?

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If that is not, you know, you think you know somebody, and you move in after a month.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, it wasn't Pauline Hall.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry, that's, you know, she just got pissy and moved out.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She probably moved in with her girlfriend after the second date, like most lesbians.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's what I was thinking, she moved out of my village, because I got boring and wouldn't, you know, send her any more letters or peaches.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And she moved out, bitch.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Lesbians are so needy.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Anyhow.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Dan's been playing Need for Speed Undercover, and I've been mocking him, because it's fun and easy.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And then, even though it's not a video game, I've been watching a lot of Supernatural, which is more fun.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Because I got to watch Jensen Ackles naked.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, not completely.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Not completely, but it was a lot more exciting than playing Animal Crossing.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Remind me, this is a show geared towards 16-year-old girls?

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hell no!

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's geared towards me.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's on the CW.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We forgive it.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
My gaming week was alright.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I watched my wife play a lot of Animal Crossing, because I'm not allowed near it, I guess.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's because you're going to go around and make all of your villagers say nasty things.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No, she's already done that.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
She already has the Genji, the Asian-looking rabbit, saying, you are my best rubber.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And there was a bunch of stuff that she's done.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
She harasses her animals quite a bit.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Dude, do you know that now it censors things? Like, you can't just have your animals say fuck.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And I tried to get mine to say poop, and it wouldn't say it. It said, that word is not allowed.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I have to tell you, though.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So now he says poop.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There was a version that got out that was supposed to be some kind of ad.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They used all the foreign letters that look like other letters.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
They used the accents.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, this is different.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The version that went out to give into a selected group as a marketing tool?

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, it was exactly that. It was using those other letters.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But one of the animals defaulted, their little catch word was the N word.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But the way they got around it was they put N and then an I with an accent.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, no, it was someone who was one of the programmers.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I know, I know.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Or they probably copied something to test it.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They copied a ROM with someone that had already played it and unlocked all the stuff.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's what it was. But yeah, they, I don't know.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Should maybe look at that first, you know? Do a little testing.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But you know they can't make it to level 30 because the boss doesn't show up.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Someone's getting fired.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Anyways, so other than watching my wife play Animal Crossing, I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV on the 360.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Still doing multiplayer and that, and that's fun.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And then I decided to try out the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV, which, you know, actually looks pretty good.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've heard a lot of people having trouble getting it to run, and I don't understand what they're doing that's making it not run.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Maybe it's because my monitor resolution only goes up to 1440 by 900.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm not sure, but, or 1400 by 900, not 1440.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But it runs pretty good for me. You know, 40, 50 frames per second, and I have a lot of sliders put up all the way.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Although I don't like the fact that this brand new game does not support SLI, so that's kind of a waste.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And it's got to be patched in later on.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know, absolute laziness, just to get it out.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But as far as any, you know, I mean, it looks good, it runs pretty good, but it's just Grand Theft Auto IV.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
After playing it for a little bit, you know, kind of starting a new game in there, I was like, wow, this is boring.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know, I've already done all this.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But it looks nice. That's pretty cool. Just waiting for all the mods and stuff to come out.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And then, other than that, I actually played some Mirror's Edge, and that was a pretty cool game, and I look forward to playing more of that.

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Kind of a controversial game, that Mirror's Edge. What do you think?

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's fun. It's hard. You know, very, very hard. You'll fall off the building a lot.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But I think people are pissed off because it's, you know, short.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And, you know, sure, I guess it doesn't innovate much, but the way I look at it is, is it fun? Yes.

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So then what are you complaining about?

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But, yeah, I'll have to play some more of that. I hear it is really short. In fact, I believe, what was it?

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yahtzee had reviewed it this week, and, man, said he beat it in a day, so it'll be interesting to see how long it takes me to finish it.

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then I've got a bunch of other games on my plate. In fact, I got another one this week, which I haven't even touched yet, Prince of Persia, so that looks pretty fun, too.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, lots of stuff.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Alright, good times. Well, my gaming week's been Animal Crossing. I finally, you know, a couple weeks ago, I think I mentioned Animal Crossing, but didn't really get too far into it.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I really spent some serious time with Animal Crossing on the Wii this week, and you know what?

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
As much as we're joking around and kind of talking about reliving the thrill of the GameCube version all over again, I have a real hard time recommending this game overall.

138
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Because it's just not enough new for me, and I kind of feel like there's Animal Crossing on the GameCube out there for much cheaper, and you almost get more in it.

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But there are some cool things in this game. The problem with this game is it feels like it's just a port of the DS version with a couple extra frills, and it just kind of leaves an Animal Crossing fan really wanting more.

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I think they should have taken more risks with this game than they did, although I will say the internet functionality works pretty cool.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
They have worked Wii Connect 24 into it a little bit, so you don't really have to go to somebody's village to send letters and things of that nature, which is an improvement over the DS version.

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But is that really worth the whole new upgrade? Not so much.

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And the city is a neat idea, but I think as it brought up on the show a couple weeks ago, it makes you kind of miss it when it would randomly show up in your village.

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And they still do randomly show up in your village, actually, but then that also begs the point, what the hell is the city for? I mean, it doesn't really do a whole lot.

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The city is for getting all of your special characters who only would randomly show up. This is so you can have the convenience of having them all the damn time.

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, I think that's stupid. It takes away the special part of it.

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No way. You still get presents floating on balloons, and you still get Gulliver showing up.

148
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Wild World didn't really hold me all that well, but this one, I'm really digging it.

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You know, it's weird. I kind of feel the same way. The DS one got old really fast, but for some reason I have been actually going back to the Wii one to kind of see if there's new stuff, but it's weird.

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Like, I say all this, yet I can't in good conscience really recommend this game. You have to really be hardcore about these types of games to get a thrill out of this.

151
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You have to really be an Animal Crossing fan, of which I was. But I'm still left wanting more.

152
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
For me, it's my sit down for an hour and relax. Seriously.

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I got wow. But I, you know...

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Addict?

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Addict? Yeah, but still. So, I guess that's pretty much all I have to say about Animal Crossing. There's not a lot more I can say about it.

156
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
As far as other new games I've been playing, not a whole lot. Just basically still been using the Xbox 360 for Netflix.

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I finally dinged level 80 in World of Warcraft. Thank you very much. Kiss my feet.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Or tell me to get a life, one of the two. But that's been fun.

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And the consensus overall amongst at least my guild, which is a casual raiding guild. We were never very hardcore about the endgame.

160
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's all the people from Final Fantasy XI still. A lot of the same people that were there moved over here. Even Glenn and some of these people from old school.

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That would be the turkey coma.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But yeah, it's been a lot of fun. We're raiding guild. The general consensus is this expansion is better than the last one.

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The stuff they did with it is much better. I love the music.

164
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Are there any new classes? Like new races or anything?

165
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Death Knight is pretty awesome.

166
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Maybe I might have to start playing it again.

167
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You have to have a level 55 character though to do a Death Knight. Because Death Knight is what they call a hero class.

168
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But they did a great job with it. The voices and stuff, they took the old voices and they made them sound echoey and powerful when your Death Knight talks.

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And it's very sexy.

170
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Rob, can you help me power level?

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I can try. I have a level 20-something priest.

172
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I've also been playing Ragnarok and you can play that with me.

173
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We'll see. I've got a lot of games to play.

174
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can get you to level 100 in two hours. I'm not joking.

175
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Speaking of pirate servers, there used to be a bunch for a while. Blizzard went on a huge crackdown this week on the private servers to shut them all down.

176
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh yeah, a bunch of the huge ones got shut down.

177
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Some comments from chat room. ActDeft in chat says, Sky, your voice like that? Not sexy.

178
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I know, you have to have the bassiness and the vocally echo that you can only really do with a computer.

179
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But I gotta say this, the Lich King sounds awesome.

180
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And one cool thing that they did with this new expansion is that the Lich King shows up in the earlier content so that it really builds up to this confrontation that you're going to have with Lich King.

181
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's not even in the damn game yet.

182
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Because he'll be the last boss they patch in six months from now.

183
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So they make it more like a conventional RPG? Is that it?

184
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, you actually see him. They did a much better job with this expansion. I think they learned a lot from the last one.

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
See, that's the one thing I would really like to see in an MMO is that they have it function like an actual RPG where you have to do point A to point B.

186
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Where your quests are not just, oh look, this person has question mark over his head and I want money.

187
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They're getting better with that. The chain quests, the story is getting better. The lore fans are really enjoying their wow this time around.

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If that's the case, because honestly, part of the reason why I like Ragnarok so much is that it's just random. It's very social for me.

189
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And I didn't really enjoy actually playing World of Warcraft because it got really dull.

190
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You might also be on the wrong server. You should try a roleplay server on WoW. You might have fun.

191
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I was on a roleplay server actually and I didn't. No one stays in character. It's annoying. I just rather hang out with everybody.

192
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
When you finally get the battle and defeat the Lich King, he'll be all, I have one last thing to say. Don't forget Guitar Hero 5 pre-orders and blah blah blah.

193
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And Starcraft 2 is right around the corner.

194
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Shut up. You forgot Diablo 3.

195
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Oh, and Diablo 3. Warcraft 4.

196
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I like how you tried to do your lazy bass echo.

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Your Lich King sounds like a drunken asshole.

198
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Hey, how much have you really gotten to know the Lich King yet?

199
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, DJ Tyrant hit the nail on the head. The last expansion had nothing like Wrathgate.

200
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He says Wrathgate is one of the absolutely best questlines of all time. In-game cutscenes for the win.

201
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They have cutscenes in the quest this time and they're epic. Epic cutscenes are very epic.

202
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And Wrathgate was hot. Everybody in our guild, because we're all WoW nerds, was having a gigantic orgasm over the Wrathgate questline because it was awesome.

203
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
See, that sounds like it would be more fun to me just having actual story to follow.

204
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't want to spoil what happens in Wrathgate, but it's pretty amazing. It's pretty epic.

205
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You get to learn a little more about the phasing technology and it's cool. It's cool.

206
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Anyhow, let's talk about other games this week and we'll get into the gaming news right after some housekeeping.

207
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Tonight's show is a short show. That's because we started late tonight at 7 o'clock due to some personal business.

208
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We'll be back with our full show next week, so sorry about that.

209
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Again, you can always listen to us live on All Games Radio, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.

210
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Speaking of Bobby, he's got a new project and we love Bobby because he always plugs our show on, so we're going to plug him a little bit.

211
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He is going to start a new show that launches January 9th and it's called Friday Night Gaming.

212
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's going to be him and two other people talking in a live program about video games.

213
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why does this sound familiar to me? No, I'm kidding.

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The niche is that they're actually taping it live at a place called Computer Arena, which is in Roswell, Georgia.

215
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Not the same Roswell where they found aliens.

216
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
They don't keep aliens there. They keep redneck aliens there.

217
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But it's actually going to be like they're going to do the interaction with the live crowd as well as the people in the chat room.

218
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That sounds awesome.

219
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They're going to have some neat co-hosts and stuff too, so I don't know how much more I can say because I don't know what he said yet, but it's going to be cool.

220
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So listen to it. FNGlive.net and that starts January 9th on All Games Radio.

221
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Anyhow, that's really all the housekeeping I have tonight.

222
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So how about some gaming news, even though it's been kind of a slow news week?

223
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So a short show seems appropriate tonight. Loki, what's up?

224
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, there is a certain Kingdom Hearts game that's scheduled to come out for the DS and you may have heard about it.

225
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Kingdom Hearts 358 slash 2 days is going to be getting a North American release.

226
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I mean, did anyone have any speculation that it wasn't going to get a release here? I mean, seriously.

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And of course, they aren't really seeing when it's coming, but that it is.

228
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Soon.

229
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm guessing next year sometime.

230
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
How about Kingdom Hearts 3?

231
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Never. I don't know.

232
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
They're going to pull a Capcom.

233
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Kingdom Hearts 2, you have to understand, is like Final Fantasy VII or the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII, where it's got to have 90 billion versions for it first before they move on to the next one.

234
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Then they can hoard that one out.

235
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Got to wear out the first prostitute first before they can move on to the next.

236
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Awesome.

237
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I still want my Kingdom Hearts 3, though, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

238
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That would be very nice with my high-def graphics and hopefully working camera.

239
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Although, Kingdom Hearts 2 wasn't bad as far as the camera goes.

240
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I thought Kingdom Hearts 2 was really solid.

241
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Kingdom Hearts 2 is a very solid game. Good time.

242
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I need to actually not glitch mine out.

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I miss games like that. It's been a little while.

244
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
When did Kingdom Hearts 2 come out? 2005? 2006, maybe?

245
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think.

246
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some other news and some other games that are dated that are highly anticipated.

247
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Probably another anticipated game by Jamie. Tekken 6.

248
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and it's been confirmed that it will be in the fall 2009 timeframe.

249
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So the Xbox 360 is supposed to... I don't know if it's getting a slightly earlier launch or something,

250
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
but they're going to hit generally the same time, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

251
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This official announcement was made by Atari, who is publishing the game over in Europe.

252
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There you have it. So it's not going to be in the same timeframe as Street Fighter 4,

253
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and we know there's not going to be a new Mortal Kombat next year because they just had one this year.

254
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Well then, I don't know. They were putting out those Mortal Kombat games a dime a dozen for a little bit.

255
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They could still do another Mortal Kombat game because all they would really have to do is port the engine over and add new characters.

256
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Let's face it, Mortal Kombat and Tekken have very, very different fan bases, so I don't think there's going to be any overlap there anyway.

257
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Very cool. Tekken 6 coming soon. No mention about arcades, though. Sad. I weep for the arcade.

258
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Really? Where is the market going?

259
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, they do have the arcade version should be already out in Japan, I think. It's not coming over here.

260
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Actually, it would probably be in the Namco arcades because I remember when all the last series of Tekken games came out,

261
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
they were released something like six months before, you know, in Namco arcades before they were in any others,

262
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
because we had Tekken 3 at my arcade for like ages before anyone else had it.

263
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But, how about something that isn't related to Tekken? Ooh. WiiWare.

264
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
All right. WiiWare. The stuff I'm boycotting.

265
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, come on, Rob. You know they have the S-

266
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
True. They did promise that they'd have more storage, but where the fuck's the update?

267
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Probably March.

268
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's just like Sony's home. Where the fuck is Sony's home? I can't play it, therefore it's not out yet.

269
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Sorry, Dr. Sakura. What can the more common folk who are not stuck up enough to be boycotting the Nintendo Wii, what can they be playing?

270
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There are more games coming out. There's actually going to be art style Roto Hex.

271
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's a remake of the generation's game Dial Hex that was on the Game Boy Advance.

272
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There's also, that's actually going to be 600 Wii points.

273
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Episode 4 of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People on its way, and it will have the DANGERESK 3 theme.

274
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Ooh. It's 1000 Wii points.

275
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I will allow you to get the Strong Bad game, because it's pretty awesome, but I do want to point out it's also available on PC, if you don't want to put up with the Nintendo Wii.

276
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Just saying. Is all.

277
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You know, I want to know when the hell they're doing an art style version of Dot Stream, because that was the most kickass bit generation game that they released.

278
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That and Sound Voyager I guess is supposed to be pretty good, but I never picked that one up.

279
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Well, there are also, there's also Bang, which is a shape matching game, and Pit Crew Panic, which should make sense. It's mechanics for broken things.

280
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's the one where you fix toilets. Remember there was a giant toilet one?

281
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Well that sounds like fun.

282
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I think we talked about that a little bit.

283
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Let's see here.

284
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Actually, let me get some chat comments before we get to some other stuff here.

285
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Some comments on Kingdom Hearts. VXJ's next V. Kingdom Hearts 2 was released March 28th, 2006.

286
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Actually, I need to credit Noah Bennett for that too, because they both said it.

287
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It was 2006 when that was released, but Act Def goes on to point out a pretty good point.

288
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oblivion, Beat Mania, and Kingdom Hearts 2 were all released the same week. That was a very busy week.

289
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Black Wolf wants to point out that Strong Bad is also cheaper on the PC. Good point.

290
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And YYR in chat I believe is commenting on the Tekken 6 story. The arcade version will not be released in North America.

291
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
They announced that a while back. I don't remember when. Selected arcades in the USA do have it.

292
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
There's like three in New York. I've played it. It rocks.

293
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And there will be an upgrade called Bloodline Rebellion. All of that from YYR.

294
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I was going to mention, since we're on the topic of WiiWare, Xbox Live Arcade will be getting Meteos Wars and Power Up forever this week as well.

295
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Really? I love Meteos, but I can't imagine not playing it with a stylus.

296
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You know I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi through the good times like Luminous and the bad times like 99 Nights.

297
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I love that man, and I will get Meteos just because it's Q Entertainment.

298
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But I really like the DS one. It was kind of underrated. Just saying.

299
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But I can't imagine not playing that game without the stylus. That's all.

300
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah. Sorry.

301
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Let's see. Well, other things that you can expect this week. It's a very short list, unfortunately, because it is this time of year.

302
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Most games have already been released for Christmas, but there are a few late editions, including Prince of Persia on the PC.

303
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Who's Tardy to the party? Who's stumbling in hungover to the Christmas party?

304
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And Sonic Unleashed on PS3. Both of those versions coming out way later. Well, not really.

305
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Who got toked up off Mad Dog at home?

306
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Not too late for Prince of Persia, but a couple weeks before Sonic Unleashed at the very least.

307
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Other titles coming out, and I'm not really going to say they're worth mentioning, but Imagine Fashion Party on the Wii. Awesome.

308
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Imagine Saving Your Money. Imagine donating it to charity.

309
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Neopets Puzzle Adventure, which looks like a ripoff of Puzzle Quest, just with Neopets. Does anyone still play Neopets?

310
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I was just talking about playing Neopets the other day because I miss playing the little games on the side.

311
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But you weren't playing them.

312
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Exactly.

313
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Let's see.

314
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I was talking about Neopets the other day in the mall when I was walking by Claire's. Do they have Claire's nationwide? Is that a nationwide chain?

315
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah. Okay. Well, for the international audience, Claire's is like the pretty, pretty princess store. It's the store for 11-year-old girls who want to dress up like princesses.

316
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And you can stop with the comments right now about how much I love Claire's.

317
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But I was looking in the window, not in the store, but in the window, and they had all these Neopets things for sale.

318
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And I was telling my friend, I remember when I used to play Neopets. Damn, I needed a life. So, that's all.

319
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And you don't now?

320
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hey, watch it.

321
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Core on DS. That'll be coming out.

322
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Let's see.

323
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Hidden Expedition, Amazon.

324
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And The Tale of Despereaux, both on PC.

325
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Other titles for this week. Slingo Quest on DS.

326
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Lego, or was it Left Brain, Right Brain 2 on DS.

327
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Driver's Ed Portable. Yes, you can practice your Driver's Ed tests on the DS now.

328
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Build A Lot, which I believe is like a real estate tycoon type game.

329
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Ski and Shoot, yet another biathlon game.

330
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
God, I just want to play some more biathlon.

331
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Dungeon Maker 2, The Hidden War on PSP.

332
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Kate West, The Vanishing Files on DS.

333
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And, of course, the big one for the week, Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 on PS2.

334
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And that is the special edition that comes with the soundtrack.

335
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Because Atlus is really hooking you up.

336
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yes.

337
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And I have to say that it's only going to get worse from here.

338
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, because the next few weeks are crap.

339
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Wow. I think Rock Band's in there somewhere, but the rest of the weeks suck.

340
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Alright, well, let's see if things are looking a little brighter in Japan.

341
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And they are. It's a little busier of a week in Japan.

342
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Strangely enough, usually Japan gets the really cool stuff before we do.

343
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
However, in this case, Japan's getting some of the cool stuff after we are.

344
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Because that happens sometimes when the games are developed over here.

345
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts is going to be released over in Japan on December 11th.

346
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
As is Mirror's Edge in Japan on the Xbox 360.

347
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Also being released December 11th on the PlayStation 3.

348
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Hakuna Matata is getting it.

349
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That's actually a General Asia release.

350
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Did that game ever get released here in the US?

351
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
No, it's going to be released here under, I think Namco is doing it, under National Geographic Africa.

352
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's a better name.

353
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Did that game get a facelift all of a sudden, didn't it?

354
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah, they're changing it up for here. It's not coming over here for a while, though.

355
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I want to see animals eating each other.

356
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Well, Hakuna Matata gets the General Asia release. It's an English-Chinese version, so you could import it technically, December 11th.

357
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But I want to see the monkeys throw poo and do it.

358
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Or you could import the UK version, which I believe is in English, and I think is already out.

359
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, there you go.

360
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Mina no Golf 5 gets a price reduction this week, this Friday.

361
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Mirror's Edge also comes to the PlayStation 3, and Virtua Fighter also gets a price reduction.

362
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And a localized version of WALL-E, the video game on PlayStation 3.

363
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That would be the Disney movie, WALL-E.

364
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
On the Wii, Cooking Mama, Mina to Isho ni Oryoi Takai.

365
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's just a price reduction. Fancy name for Cooking Mama 2.

366
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, the Wii edition comes out this week, as does Facebreaker.

367
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And Major Wii and Samba de Amigo comes out as well.

368
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Taiko no Tatujin also gets a Wii release, and I know we have some Taiko fans from the music game folks.

369
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Also, Dark Sakura, are you listening? December 11th, Japan.

370
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Cross Generation of Heroes comes out.

371
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So you might want to be looking into imports pretty soon.

372
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
On the PlayStation 2, Galaxy Angel 2 gets a price reduction.

373
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But, you know what? I think most of our listeners are probably going to be looking for Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4.

374
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Call it a hunch.

375
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh no! I'm sorry, that's the US release. My bad.

376
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Sometimes some US dates sneak into my list here. My bad.

377
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Well, I have dates for our UK people.

378
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Wait, DS, real quick.

379
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Elibits this week. And a game called Penguin. No Bondai.

380
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Okay, I'm done.

381
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No, that's it.

382
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
No, I'm done.

383
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Are you sure? Are you positive?

384
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Okay.

385
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And Wall-E.

386
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
On the DS.

387
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Ferret! Return the ferret. I command thee.

388
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I command thee.

389
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You do need to put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it you can yank it back.

390
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's a bungee ferret.

391
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Not that I should be encouraging you to do this.

392
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Thank you for...

393
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You know, there was a totally random conversation that we had yesterday.

394
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It didn't involve ferrets?

395
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
No, it didn't involve ferrets. It involved small animals.

396
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
We were talking about that they should breathe like micro monkeys and call them, like, monkeys.

397
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That would be funny.

398
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I don't know where that came from. We were at a really boring Christmas party at my dad's house.

399
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We're out of alcohol. Let's eat sugar and brainstorm.

400
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You know what they need to do?

401
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Wait, since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and all this good Xbox Live thing, shouldn't they have a game called Bungee Ferret Tossing?

402
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It could be like Orange Lawns Radio presents Bungee Ferret Tossing.

403
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Add this to the list of Orange Lawns Radio Dream Games.

404
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
No, add this to the list of Orange Lawns Radio Reality Games.

405
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We need to tell Mikey about the Dream Games.

406
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We need to learn how to program or something.

407
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We have a series of games that we're mostly developing.

408
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Take a class on programming.

409
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Learn it!

410
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Absorb via osmosis.

411
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You can learn it.

412
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Anyhow, sorry.

413
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You're a towel.

414
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
UK dates, please.

415
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
11th, Luminous Supernova on PlayStation 3. That makes me go squee and get happy in places.

416
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
On the 12th, some stuff.

417
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Prince of Persia for PC, the Magic Roundabout.

418
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
For people in America who don't know what a roundabout is, Traffic Circle.

419
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I have to translate.

420
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Things I fucking hate when I'm driving downtown.

421
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Dude, I fucking love them.

422
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I love them. Because at my college we had one and it was big and had a park in it and my friends swore up and down that demons live there.

423
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm not joking.

424
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You're the most random fucking person on the planet sometimes.

425
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm not joking.

426
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Demons were living in the roundabout and this has what to do with video gaming?

427
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The Magic Roundabout!

428
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
They're magic!

429
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I do miss that...

430
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Rob is red.

431
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This show sucks.

432
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You suck!

433
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Laughter is warm and we're not.

434
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
One thing we forgot to mention, the studio is freezing cold tonight.

435
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Keep in mind, we're Californians and we're pretty spoiled.

436
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So I'm sure this is nothing. This is a summer day in Alaska right now.

437
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But we are freezing cold in here right now.

438
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So just wanted to get that out there.

439
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So if we seem kind of cracked out, we are.

440
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And also coming out, Your Mom the Game. Done.

441
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Well, hopefully Your Mom the Game lasts longer than Mirror's Edge.

442
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Longer than the player.

443
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Loki. Sorry. Save our show.

444
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I was looking at, there was a game I used to play that I thought, it's not roundabout, but it sounded just like it.

445
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And it was, I was just trying to find a name for it.

446
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It used to be called, the one that came over here was Felony 179, but it might actually have been called roundabout in the UK or something.

447
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Really fun game where you break stuff with cars.

448
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah, so another thing that's totally on topic with breaking stuff with cars.

449
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Mama is gardening now. Yes, gardening Mama.

450
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Yet another thing that they're trying to get guys to play.

451
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
First they get them cooking and then they get them planting stuff in the garden.

452
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Wait a minute, this is some type of secret plot, isn't it?

453
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
To get men to do the things that women are supposed to be doing.

454
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What's next? Laundry Mama?

455
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I will not stand for it.

456
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Don't worry, Mama will wash it.

457
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The next one was, what was it, not Pet City Mama. It has nothing to do with pets though. Pet Shop Mama.

458
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Poop Scoop Mama?

459
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't know, see I understand the whole gardening thing because people grow fruits and vegetables in their garden and they can use them to cook.

460
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
The Pet Shop Mama, I don't like where that's going. I don't like associating the pet shop with food.

461
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But food is delicious and some pets are tasty.

462
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That is a little strange that Cooking Mama will work in the pet shop part time and then she cooks things and PETA has a problem with it the other half of the time. Just saying.

463
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay, that PETA thing was bullshit.

464
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That's right, you were gone when all that went down.

465
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Oh, no, remember I posted on my Twitter.

466
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That was the week we were all off, was the PETA thing.

467
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I posted on my Twitter about this.

468
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And I think we talked about it briefly last week on the show and I was like, ah, if Jamie was here she'd say it's bullshit.

469
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's bullshit! Fuck you, PETA. My pre-emptive F you goes to PETA, may you get fucked with a steak.

470
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
A big, bloody cow rib.

471
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
We're really mature here on Orange Lounge Radio.

472
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Okay, she really just said go fuck yourself with a steak. Am I not mistaking?

473
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
No, no, no, no, no.

474
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
With ribs.

475
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Ribs.

476
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Amazing.

477
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Hey, we have some local news here. You know, sometimes we make the news with some things that go on locally.

478
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And you know the game America's Army? Have you heard of the game America's Army?

479
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yes.

480
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's kind of a game that the Army put out to, you know, kind of be like other first person shooters, quote unquote.

481
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Although I would hope the violence isn't quite as glorified.

482
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But it's kind of a recruitment tool for the Army, America's Army, obviously.

483
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You know, the game is free to play.

484
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And it's a fairly popular game, you know, because it's, again, pretty old.

485
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's pretty old, too. I mean, the last game that they put out sucked.

486
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Well, get this. Right here in Rancho Cordova, where we tape our show, a suburb of Sacramento, where the OLR Studios is,

487
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
not even that far from where we tape, only like one exit up the freeway,

488
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
there was a U.S. Army video game tournament for the game America's Army that happened right here in our neck of the woods.

489
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Apparently, there were protests that ended up making the news here locally.

490
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Some Veterans for Peace were out there actually protesting, and they have some pictures.

491
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And this guy is holding the sign saying, real war is hell, don't enlist.

492
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And the guy who is the president of this organization, John C. Reiger, the Sacramento branch,

493
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
he said, it's like giving candy to kids. It's sort of like military pedophilia, in a way, preying on our young people.

494
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
He really did use that phrase, military pedophilia. That's the quote he used, not me.

495
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So, there you go.

496
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And kind of the counter quote there was from Victor Ferrer, who is a sergeant in the Army.

497
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
He said, the event is nothing more than an opportunity for people to become familiar with the Army.

498
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
They also wanted to clarify the tournament was open to players 17 and over.

499
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Anyone under 17 had to have a parent or guardian there in order to compete in the tournament.

500
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And sign up for the military.

501
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
If we had known it was going on, we would have gone out there.

502
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
No, I would not have.

503
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I would have played.

504
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't think people think of Orange Lounge Radio when they think of America's Army, the game.

505
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
They think of the O.L. Army.

506
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Usually not the type of game we cover, but I would have gone out there just to kind of check it out.

507
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Did you see what SSG100Matt said in the chatroom?

508
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
No.

509
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The winner of the tournament gets to go to Iraq.

510
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So, it's like a twisted version of, you know, what the hell was that?

511
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
God, why am I drawing a blank no? 80s movie.

512
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Last Starfighter. Sorry.

513
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Dude, The Last Starfighter was awesome.

514
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yes, it's like The Last Starfighter, just more death.

515
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I've got a friend of mine in Iraq right now, and I would not want anyone to go over there, so.

516
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And to go back to what I was talking about when she was mentioning Roundabout, or Roundabouts or whatever.

517
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Roundabout.

518
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes, Roundabouts. Well, the game I was thinking was called Runabout, and it was, yeah, the U.S. title was Felony 1179.

519
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Fun game. I got a bus stuck in a subway tunnel in that game, and it spun out of control until it took off like a helicopter.

520
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Not to say that the game was, you know, glitchy or anything.

521
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Good times. Good times.

522
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
How about some more gaming news?

523
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Do I gotta?

524
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You gotta.

525
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Well, this is actually some pretty good news for all of our Suicoden fans.

526
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
We are getting a...

527
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
All 108 of you.

528
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
108 of you. There's a joke there.

529
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
See if you can spot it.

530
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I haven't even played the damn game, and I get the joke. Thanks to Shane, thank you.

531
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But for all of our friends in Europe, Suicoden, I guess it's pronounced T-Christ, is coming out on the DS in March next year.

532
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And basically the game is, you start off as this unnamed person who's in a security force who has to recruit 108 heroes to battle the one king.

533
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And you have a four-person party, and it's Suicoden, and you can go over the Wi-Fi to send characters into different games or other worlds so they can get new items, different quests, meet new people.

534
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And this one actually just came out in Japan, and we here in America are supposed to be getting it in February.

535
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But sorry, people in Europe, you've gotta wait. Or import!

536
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But it should be noted, this is not like your typical Suicoden game. It's more of a tactical-type game.

537
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yeah, it's more tactics.

538
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
They call it a community RPG.

539
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So it's really a mini men online role-playing girls game.

540
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Hmm.

541
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Interesting.

542
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
With tactics!

543
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And stuff.

544
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Speaking of stuff, Atari has announced a brand new game that they're working on with Tetsuya Mizuguchi.

545
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's a music game with the working title QJ.

546
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And of course, you know, their Q Entertainment is known for their games that kind of blend in pretty cool musical aspects to it, so making, I don't know, a musical game is not necessarily a bad thing and not really unexpected.

547
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Something else to look forward to, I guess. I guess we'll find out a little bit more about this later on.

548
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I would be more worried if it was called LLQJ.

549
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Nice.

550
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I've had sugar today, Rob.

551
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And how?

552
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And how?

553
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Well hey, I'm all over this. You talk music, you talk Mizuguchi, Q Entertainment, you know I'm gonna check it out because I'm a whore for everything that man puts out.

554
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So you know I'm excited about this one if I didn't already have everything that this is gonna be offering.

555
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But Atari is going to be bundling several of Mizuguchi's games together.

556
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Res HD, Luminous Live, and Every Extend Extra Extreme are all gonna be retailed together in one retail package.

557
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It's gonna be called Q3, which is supposed to be some type of term meaning cubed, I guess. Whatever.

558
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Or you could do San-Q-3-thank-you-three.

559
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Oh that's a cute idea.

560
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Because it was the same pun with QQQ?

561
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Okay.

562
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
San-Q-thank-you.

563
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I get it, I get it.

564
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Well you can also do, I mean, you know, to the third power is cubing something, so.

565
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Right, right.

566
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
But that's cute. Either way, I didn't even think of the San-Q thing. That's pretty cute.

567
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But anyway, you know, I'm sure a lot of our listeners probably already downloaded these games, but this is good news for those that are the more casual Xbox 360 people that don't take it online.

568
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I would get this.

569
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yeah, I mean.

570
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Because we haven't downloaded all this yet.

571
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And here's your perfect opportunity, because, you know, even though the, it's kind of repackaged of old material, you're talking about some really good old material.

572
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It's ResHD, it's Luminous Live, it's Every Extent Extra Extreme.

573
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And it's, it's mostly, the download content for Luminous is all a part of this too.

574
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So it's all in one nice little package.

575
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So, very cool.

576
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Does it actually save any money, though, over downloading everything with points?

577
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I don't think it's gonna save very much. I don't see a price point listed here.

578
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Probably worth all the download content for, like, Luminous.

579
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Yeah, with the download content included, I think this is actually a pretty good package deal.

580
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I mean, it saves you time and effort, really, you know, if just that.

581
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's based on your hard drive if you're crunched, I guess.

582
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Exactly. It's saving room, and it's, you know, putting, you know, and there's also people who, you know, may have an Xbox who may not necessarily have, like, an internet connection.

583
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I know people who were like that, you know, who don't have it hooked up all the time.

584
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's a good way to, you know, get all the download content and not have to worry about it.

585
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
True, true.

586
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So, that helps.

587
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Well, I mean, there's no reason for me to get this, because I always bottled this shit the first day it came out, but I'm glad to see that there's enough faith in the product that they're giving it a retail release.

588
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I mean, who would have thought, years ago when Rez was on Dreamcast, it was kind of a cult title? Like, not everybody really knew about it.

589
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Who knew that it would be kind of resurfacing in the mainstream again today, if that makes any sense? I don't know.

590
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I kind of wish they'd do a true sequel to Rez. Wouldn't that be hot?

591
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Well, yeah, that would actually be pretty cool, I think.

592
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
We'll see.

593
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Well, how about some other stuff?

594
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
How about something that's gonna make my soul hurt?

595
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
But the soul still burns.

596
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
No, my soul isn't burning, it's fucking freezing and throwing up in the bathroom like a bad vodka hangover.

597
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Okay, it's not that cold in here.

598
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
No, I'm not talking about in here, I'm talking about the King of Fighters movie.

599
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
King of Fighters movie?

600
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Um, they are already, Gordon Chan is directing it. There's not too many details, but they're sad.

601
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And this is basically what was put out saying about it.

602
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It looks like the King of Fighters movie will introduce a new science fiction spin into the setting.

603
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
That right there is enough to make me vomit. It's enough to make my heart work.

604
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Fighters in space!

605
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Pretty much that's it. They're supposed to be going to different dimensions and different worlds.

606
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Um, hi, the story works like it did before, don't fuck with it!

607
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
They're all stuck in, like, the Neo Geo world. They have to go to different games and destroy the characters and that.

608
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It's like the crap they tried to do with the last Mortal Kombat movie?

609
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
No! Don't ruin my movie, please!

610
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
King of Fighters was like a classic staple in fighting games for me.

611
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I mean, I grew as a gamer when King of Fighters came out and expanded my mental universe.

612
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And made me realize that, yes, SNK can do a good fighting game other than Samurai Shodown.

613
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And what kind of cherished childhood memory would it be if they didn't come and rape it later on in movie form?

614
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Well, at least it's not being directed by Uwe Boll, so that's good.

615
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Well, I'm glad I have something to be thankful for this holiday season.

616
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But the stars of the movie are Maggie Q, Sean Ferris, William Lee, and Ray Park.

617
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Who?

618
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Wait, Ray Park!

619
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Darth Maul!

620
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Darth Maul, yes.

621
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And Seth Rogen.

622
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And what?

623
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And Toad!

624
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Toad, yeah.

625
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Do you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad?

626
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Same thing that happens to everything else.

627
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It was awesome when Storm said it!

628
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
No, it wasn't!

629
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Actually, it wasn't. It really, really wasn't.

630
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Okay, do not get this couch started on Halle Berry and how much ass she sucks.

631
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh, but Jamie Catwoman! No, wait.

632
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I've blocked that out of my memory. It does not exist as a part of my universe.

633
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Hey, it could be worse, okay? They could have had Tyra Banks play the part or something like that.

634
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Tyra Banks has more personality, thank you.

635
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
She would have brought the much needed sass to the part.

636
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
She would have brought the sass and she would have brought...she just would have brought it.

637
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
When Angela Bassett declined, it was over. I mean, really.

638
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But you know, Angela Bassett, I do agree to an extent that she was...she's done an X-Men movie ten years ago.

639
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
She was Storm. That would have been it.

640
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But ten years ago, she was Tina Turner.

641
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
That's true.

642
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
If anyone can pull off the legs, then, you know.

643
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Well, anyway.

644
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Okay, sorry. When I'm singing Tina Turner songs, it's really time for us to get back to gaming news.

645
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Is it? Yes. Let's talk about Activision.

646
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
We've been putting that in an uncomfortable place.

647
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Something I'm completely used to by now.

648
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So, Activision. They have a lot of brand new stuff coming next year, including...

649
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Oh, gosh. What would it be without another Call of Duty game?

650
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yes, there's another Call of Duty game coming out next year.

651
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It will hit Fall 2009, and apparently it's going to be back in Infinity Ward's hands again, so we can stop bitching about it.

652
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And then also, they're going to be doing a brand new Bond game, because, well...

653
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It's another franchise that they have to pump out one new game a year.

654
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And then finally, they're going to do something a little different with the next Tony Hawk game,

655
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
which apparently is going to not be played with a controller,

656
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and will be a game that you're not going to be playing with a controller in your hands, according to them.

657
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And of course, what everybody's been speculating, the rumors have been around for a long time now,

658
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
that it's going to be actually some sort of motion-controlled skateboard thing.

659
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Which, at that point, I have to ask...

660
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Why don't you just go skateboard, then?

661
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
If you're not actually going to be playing with a controller, just go skateboard.

662
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I mean, you're almost there anyways, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper.

663
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The air conditioning. Carpet.

664
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I know. But still. Skateboarding.

665
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I mean, once you get to the point where it's so much like the thing that you're doing,

666
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
that you're actually doing it, you might as well just go actually do the sport.

667
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And I'm sure this forgot to mention that they're probably going to be pumping out like four more Guitar Hero games,

668
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
because, you know, they haven't buried that into the ground enough yet.

669
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Oh, and Bizarre Creations. You may remember them from the Project Gotham Racing series.

670
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
They're actually working on another racing game as well that's going to be racing and driving focused.

671
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
You know, because that would be any other racing game.

672
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And they're also working on one that's going to be similar to Mario Kart meets Forza.

673
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
What the hell? Mario Kart meets Forza?

674
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Maybe it's like a Mario Kart type of game, but you actually tune your karts and like what weapons and stuff are on it and that kind of thing.

675
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
How about a cute Forza game? That would be cute.

676
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
They already got Coral Q.

677
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You know, if you want your Q race, the Coral Q franchise.

678
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Did you see that they're actually putting out, and I don't know why they've done this over here,

679
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
apparently EA doesn't know how to make games for the Wii,

680
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:46,000
but they've decided that the next best idea to bringing NASCAR to the Wii instead of actually, I don't know, bringing NASCAR to the Wii is NASCAR Karts.

681
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
What?

682
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, it's like Mario Kart with NASCAR drivers.

683
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
What?

684
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yup.

685
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Interesting.

686
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That's what EA thinks of you Wii owners. You're just little kids that don't know any better.

687
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
They won't give you any serious games, except for Boom Blocks. That's not really that serious.

688
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
That's sad.

689
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Well, while Loki was reading us that last little story there, I actually was working on my portal that lets us peer inside Dark Sakura's alternate universe.

690
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
What?

691
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So I actually have a clip from Dark Sakura's alternate universe where Tyra Banks is Storm.

692
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
In fact, I'm going to show you how fantastic my underwear make me feel!

693
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I really feel crazy standing up here in my underwear. I'm used to doing this on a, you know, a Victoria's Secret runway or in a catalog, but not on the Tyra show.

694
00:50:45,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So I need a little help. Everybody, on the count of 1, 2, 3, I want you to lose those under-the-canopy robes right now. Free that underwear everybody!

695
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:36,000
This is too much tire for this show, only the best part is coming up, lord, it's a panty

696
00:51:36,000 --> 00:52:01,000
party

697
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:19,000
party

698
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:34,000
in

699
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:53,000
it

700
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:12,000
is

701
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:31,000
a

00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:56,000

party party party party party

765
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Someone stole the Metroid, and she had to go back after her baby.

766
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Same as this jellyfish-looking baby.

767
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Digitized voice for Super Nintendo, hi!

768
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Anyway.

769
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I'm not sure if this game is sexy or not, but I think it's funny that the Metroid producer was busy working on the Virtual Boy at the time and didn't have much involvement with this.

770
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:43,000
But this is a game that I'll get Dan to play, and I'll just sit back on the couch going,

771
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Go this way, go that way, go this way, go that way.

772
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
That's really freaking cool. You're better at this than I am.

773
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Let me know my thoughts on this game. I love this game more than most other games.

774
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Pretty much any other game. I love this game so much. I think it's, you know.

775
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I've already been caught up in the controversy about how much I love this game. I won't repeat it, but let's just say I love this game.

776
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,000
This game is electronic mookie. So, um, what?

777
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
It is! It is sex and pixels. It really is.

778
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Without being dirty.

779
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Of course, we all know that this game has been the big influence for the current series of Castlevania games.

780
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You know, with that same type of map system running all over the place shooting stuff, except using a whip.

781
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It also is one of, it's actually stated in my resource that it was a contributor to the speedrun phenomenon.

782
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Because you did actually, for beating the game in different ways, you got different rewards, different things.

783
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
You can speedrun through Super Metroid like a mofo if you know where you're going and what you're doing.

784
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I've seen this game beaten in person on a major speedrun, and it was beautiful.

785
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
So, it's really awesome-tastic.

786
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Super Metroid game of the week.

787
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,000
You have to get it to the point where it plays the theme.

788
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I think it's just going to start the first level.

789
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Here we go.

790
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Right?

791
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Yeah.

792
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I love this game.

793
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I do love this game. I want to play this game right now!

794
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
The music in this game was freaking fantastic.

795
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
It really was.

796
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:47,000
You know what the Nintendo Sound Processor was eventually what was incorporated, if I'm right, it's what led to the one in the PlayStation.

797
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Because Sony made Nintendo Sound Processor.

798
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:58,000
You know, I really just want to say, because we do have some younger folks who listen to this show who weren't a teenager or junior high or whatever when this game first came out.

799
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Really owe it to yourself to check out this game. This is gaming at some of its greatest.

800
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And as much crap as I've given the whole Chrono Trigger vs. Super Metroid thing that came up totally unnecessarily months ago on this show.

801
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Play Chrono Trigger 2. I mean, they're both wonderful games, but I love Super Metroid so much.

802
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:28,000
See, if they were smart they would just go back and do, remember the same treatment that they basically did with Wario Land Shake It, just do that for Super Metroid or just a Metroid game.

803
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Make a really awesome looking 2D Metroid game.

804
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And not on the DS.

805
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And not on the DS.

806
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I mean, seriously, no one's going to care if it's a 2D game. No one's not going to buy your game just because, oh it's 2D, I don't want to play a 2D game.

807
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Well, you know what, people will play a 2D game and they will like it.

808
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Look at a game like Braid, you can still do awesome things in 2D.

809
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Look at Castlevania games, they sell hotcakes on the DS.

810
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And they would sell hotcakes on the Wii if they put out a really cool looking 2D Castlevania game.

811
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:09,000
You don't have to go all 3D, just make it fun, make it exciting, that's all you have to do.

812
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Alright, well we are going to go, hey you know that Metroid Zero game, even though it was on the Game Boy Advance, was pretty awesome.

813
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Like that was a great, like, successor in a way to Super Metroid, if that makes sense.

814
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And they revisited the original Metroid but changed just enough that it really felt all new again, which I thought was kind of awesome.

815
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
So, there you go.

816
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It's open, I'm just now seeing though that our time might have run out on him.

817
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Whoops! We'll see.

818
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I'm curious if the Skype line is going to work tonight or if I'm late.

819
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Today was the day it runs out, so we may or may not be able to get calls tonight.

820
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
1877-GAME-OLR.

821
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I'm going to try calling it myself real fast and see if it works.

822
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:59,000
We have a call, oh that call is coming in on Skype though.

823
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
GAME-OLR.

824
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Let me see if it works, I'm calling it myself.

825
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I do this live on air test that's very professional?

826
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Yes.

827
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Real quick stuff, just confirming a lot of the rumors that we had from a couple weeks ago.

828
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Uncharted 2, Among Thieves, was announced.

829
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Remember that thing that supposedly leaked out from Sony saying that there was a new Uncharted game?

830
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Well, apparently it's true, so I wonder if the rest of it will be true as well.

831
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Another big game that we should have mentioned during the show, but Killzone 2 finally got a release date.

832
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
February 27th.

833
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:45,000
If there's ever going to be an epic first person shooter game for the PS3, it's definitely Killzone 2.

834
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
They're kind of Gears of War if you want to look at it that way.

835
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Kind of interesting, someone's bringing Catan to the PS3 as well.

836
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Game Republic is bringing out that game.

837
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
It's actually going to be a different version that was on the 360.

838
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Kind of like this one better.

839
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
No word on when that's going to be out though.

840
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
There's also a brand new game that's been announced by Fifth Cell,

841
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:17,000
the developer that put out that game, Drawn to Life, and also Lock's Quest.

842
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It's going to be a little bit similar to Drawn to Life.

843
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
What it is, is it's actually an action puzzler game,

844
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,000
and you can type in words, or you write in words,

845
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
and it will create objects for you based on what you write in.

846
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
So for example, you have to collect these stars throughout the game,

847
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
and you can write in ladder, and a ladder will spawn.

848
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
You can climb the ladder to get the star, or you write in football,

849
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
and you can throw a football at the tree, or beaver,

850
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
and the beaver will chew down the tree.

851
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Apparently there's such an enormous dictionary of words in this game,

852
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
you can literally put whatever you want.

853
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I mean, just from ordinary objects to the most obscure thing you can think of.

854
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And they promise apparently sharks with lasers on their heads.

855
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
So that's kind of neat.

856
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And then finally, I'd like to mention that apparently,

857
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,000
according to YYR in chat, he is having a contest.

858
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Oh, I was going to read this.

859
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Well, fine, you go ahead and read this.

860
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
No, go ahead.

861
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
No, no, no, go ahead.

862
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
No, no, go ahead.

863
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Okay, I will say this.

864
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
The contest actually doesn't start until Tuesday.

865
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
We're giving you a sneak peek right here, Snake 360 contest.

866
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And you can win, or there's $450 in prizes to be given away.

867
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And they have three different challenges,

868
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Race to Fanatic, Survivor Challenge, and Battle Video Exhibition.

869
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
And of course, different prizes.

870
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Looks like the prizes for each category include either 4,000 points card,

871
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
or one year of live.

872
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Lots of stuff being given away, so that's kind of cool.

873
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And apparently, the contest starts on Tuesday, ends on Sunday, January 11th.

874
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And we can really say, and truthfully say,

875
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
you heard it here first, because Aaron, the author of the game,

876
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
just put this up and sent us a message first,

877
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
because we had him on our show a couple weeks ago,

878
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
and he hasn't forgotten about us.

879
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Awesome guy.

880
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Thank you very much.

881
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And I don't know if we're automatically ineligible,

882
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
but I'm thinking the Battle Video might actually be kind of fun to try.

883
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
We might have to do that.

884
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I don't know.

885
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So we'll see.

886
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
All right.

887
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
The Skype line, the number is not working tonight,

888
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
but you can still call us via Skype, actual Skype.

889
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

890
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I saw at least one call trying to come through earlier,

891
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
which I will take if it comes in again.

892
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Otherwise, sorry kids, you have to be on actual Skype tonight.

893
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
But the Skype line is open at Orange Launch Radio.

894
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Did you have anything else you want to add real quick?

895
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Well, no.

896
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Wow, all right.

897
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I was looking to see if I had any more stories.

898
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I do.

899
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
They had a, what is it, Half-Life remake called Black Mesa

900
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
that they released a trailer video for last week right after the show.

901
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
It looks so amazing.

902
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
It's using the source engine.

903
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
It's basically just a remake of the first Half-Life game.

904
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
That sounds pretty fun.

905
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It was pretty cool.

906
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And then, of course, Gran Turismo 5 apparently is on track for Holiday 09.

907
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Funny because I thought that was supposed to be out this year,

908
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
but, you know, hey, I guess it's still on track to come out someday.

909
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
So is home.

910
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Hey, we got a call.

911
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

912
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
What is this?

913
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Hello, Orange Launch Radio Land.

914
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Apparently I'm very special tonight,

915
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
and the one voice of the crowd or something like that.

916
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Are you the only one wanting to call in tonight in chat?

917
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I don't know.

918
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
You were saying something that only one person called,

919
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
and I know I called.

920
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Well, no, as one person was trying to get through,

921
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I was doing all those tests,

922
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
but stupid me, the Skype number expired today,

923
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
and I got so busy I just never renewed it.

924
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Are you going to be able to get the same one back,

925
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
or am I going to have to update what the toll free goes to?

926
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
No, we'll be able to get the same number back.

927
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I'm not worried about that.

928
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I'm going to wait for 90 days,

929
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
because I've let it expire before.

930
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Live radio, folks.

931
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
One radio.

932
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Yeah, I know.

933
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
You know what's funny?

934
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
That's the charm of Orange Launch Radio.

935
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Kind of on the same old note there,

936
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
GoDaddy's been emailing me like a bitch to get me to renew O-L-R-E,

937
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
and I was like, oh, I'm just going to let it expire.

938
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
They automatically renewed it for me and charged me the money.

939
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Oh, nice.

940
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I think the E3 site we had also,

941
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I think that finally actually expired,

942
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
because we never did anything with it.

943
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Oh, my goodness.

944
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Anyway, I do want to say real quick,

945
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
sorry, Jason, interrupt,

946
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
but we never gave the damn website for the Snake 360 contest,

947
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
because we're bad hosts.

948
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
www.snake360.com slash contest,

949
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
where you can see all the information about it,

950
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and it's a great community game.

951
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Check it out.

952
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Jason, what were you calling about tonight?

953
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Sorry.

954
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
When DJ Hero and all that stuff was kind of coming up,

955
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I was just kind of going around looking for information,

956
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and I pulled up a Kotaku post about it with the first notes on it,

957
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,000
and the picture of it reminded me of a story that I don't believe I've told on here.

958
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Before I get into that, I was just going to kind of ask,

959
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
there's been a screenshot that makes DJ Hero look like Guitar Hero

960
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
with a DJ floating next to the chart,

961
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
but we don't really know anything about the game itself for the controller, do we?

962
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
There were some rumors about the controller a while back.

963
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Wasn't the controller supposed to be like a giant turntable

964
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
with kind of like buttons around it or something like that?

965
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I seem to remember there was a story a couple,

966
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
yeah, something like, it's not going to look like Beatmania.

967
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
That's for sure.

968
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
That's a common misconception about it is that,

969
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
oh, well, they're going to rip off Beatmania.

970
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
No, it doesn't look like they really want to go for that exact same game.

971
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It's going to be different, it looks like.

972
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Guitars and drums can't exactly be made original

973
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
when they're supposed to be guitars and drums,

974
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
but DJ decks have a lot of liberty to play with.

975
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
So the Kotaku entry that I was talking about,

976
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
you know that Joystick and Kotaku and everybody else

977
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
picks a featured picture that I've been,

978
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
that my Mario Kart code has been so greatly featured on three years ago.

979
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
They have this little actual DJ pioneer deck

980
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
that reminded me of something I saw at Best Buy.

981
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Our Best Buy opened up a musical instruments corner of the building,

982
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
and when we were there the last time,

983
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
we kind of poked our heads in there and were killing some time.

984
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
They had a bunch of drum kits, digital drum kits laid out.

985
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:25,000
They had drawers of DJ kits with full-size digital turntable decks, I guess,

986
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
and little miniature turntable decks with the crossfader and the,

987
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
if there's a specific name for the centerpiece,

988
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
far be it for me to know what it's called.

989
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
But I was sitting there and I was kind of playing around with it

990
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
and I was thinking to myself, you know, this is really cool.

991
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
This is actually kind of fun.

992
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:46,000
You have the full-size LP deck with a little slot reader on the side

993
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
to stick your CD in and then do the same things you would do with vinyls.

994
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Whether that's better or not, I leave that to the purists.

995
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Anyways, I'm kind of looking forward to seeing more with what comes about with DJ Hero.

996
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I think we are all on pins and needles about DJ Hero, Jason,

997
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
but the sad thing is I don't think we're going to see it until E3.

998
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I think it's going to be Activision's big thing at E3 next year

999
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
because with Guitar Hero, we know that shit.

1000
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
They say, new Guitar Hero game. We're like, whoopty shit.

1001
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
We know what this is all about.

1002
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
DJ Hero is going to be real new, you know what I mean?

1003
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Yeah, and you can draw the parallels to everything you want that's already come out.

1004
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
B-Mania and Crackin' DJ.

1005
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I seem to remember there was something even more obscure that I can't think of.

1006
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Crackin' DJ was fun and all, but it just wasn't a real deck besides...

1007
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Okay, it was two turntables and a crossfader.

1008
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Two turntables and a microphone.

1009
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
But none of the effectors, none of the volumes, none of that.

1010
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I'll also remember this, Jason. 98% of gamers haven't played any of those games you just mentioned, too.

1011
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
But DJ Hero really has the potential to kind of...

1012
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
The foot is already in the door, so to speak.

1013
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Because the same thing could have been said for Guitar Hero.

1014
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It's going to get shelf space right next to Guitar Hero.

1015
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Which is a big shelf.

1016
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Think about how really huge Guitar Hero's gotten.

1017
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I was watching a commercial for Best Buy the other day where they were talking about...

1018
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
They were trying to do some type of like, oh, it's your hometown electronics store.

1019
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And they were talking about Killeen, Texas, which is funny because it's making me think of Travis from Understation Live.

1020
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But they were talking about Texas, and they were talking about like, oh, it's a big military base.

1021
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And this guy was talking about, oh, and you know, sometimes women will come in here and want to know,

1022
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
where's that guitar game for my husband who's been away?

1023
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And I'm thinking like, wow.

1024
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
That really just kind of put it into perspective.

1025
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It really has kind of crossed over now into that guitar game that every family has to have, if that makes sense.

1026
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
That's because they picked music that people actually know and care about to some extent.

1027
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:48,000
But DJ Hero is going to have a huge foot in the door because of the mainstream success of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, really.

1028
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Yeah.

1029
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And the fact that they're actually going for names like T.S.O. and anybody else that they're going to sign and announce later on down the line.

1030
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Who would have thunk it when we started this show a few years ago that music games would become so huge, huh?

1031
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Especially after we moved away from just music games.

1032
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Well, that's what did it.

1033
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Remember there was no new DDR for like years and years and literally two weeks after we said,

1034
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
oh, we're going to move away from the music game things and talk about general gaming.

1035
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Supernova!

1036
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Supernova is coming out.

1037
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
We're back!

1038
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

1039
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Bastards.

1040
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
All right.

1041
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Anyway.

1042
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Konami exists to spite you.

1043
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Konami does exist to spite us sometimes.

1044
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I really truly believe that.

1045
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I think the most interesting part about all this is the Guitar Hero arcade machine, arcade cabinets that was talked about a few weeks back.

1046
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Yeah.

1047
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:44,000
And just the fact that they can do, especially with the fact that Guitar Hero itself went World Tour and the fact that apparently Konami is working with Activision for the cabinets.

1048
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
If that didn't just signal Rock Revolution's death that we already knew was coming, what does?

1049
01:28:49,000 --> 01:29:02,000
But just the fact that World Tour exists and DJ Hero was acquired by Activision, should I say Freestyle Games was acquired by Activision who was making DJ Hero.

1050
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:14,000
The big linked performance games that we always wanted out of DDR, 2DX, Guitar Freaks, Drummania, and optionally Keyboardmania, but that died pretty quick,

1051
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:21,000
can actually come stateside, stateside music, and possibly do a lot for arcades for all we know.

1052
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
That would be freaking expensive though.

1053
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
You know, I said this a long time ago on the show and I truly believe it.

1054
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:32,000
You know, Harmonix and these developers were willing to take the risk that Konami wasn't and look where it got them.

1055
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And Konami should be kicking their own ass right now and if they didn't have the, if there weren't patent laws and all that stuff so that they could essentially ride the coattails now of someone else's success from their idea, which is odd, there wouldn't be a lot going for them right now in the music game world.

1056
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:53,000
As much as we can hate on them for filing those lawsuits, the fact that they're working together for an arcade machine is kind of redeeming.

1057
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I want to quickly say this comment, Jason, before we let you go, get your reaction to this. Tiger Claw in chat says,

1058
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,000
If you want to play your own version of DJ Hero, you can download a DJ mixing program on your PC and mix your own MP3s.

1059
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
But that's boring because that's not telling me how to do it.

1060
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I can't play without arrows on the screen.

1061
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
There's no arrows to step on. Or whatever.

1062
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Alright, Jason, we gotta let you go to get a couple more calls, but you have a good one, buddy.

1063
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Giant dork fest!

1064
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Alright, yeah, that's the show. Alright, later dude.

1065
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Night, guys.

1066
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
At first you told me there was no mailbag, now you're telling me there's a mailbag.

1067
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I didn't think we'd have time.

1068
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Alright, well, we'll do it. Since no one else is calling on Skype, we'll close Skype.

1069
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:09,000
You know what, we need to actually have theme music for the Skype thing, and we need to play Bananaphone.

1070
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
You know what's funny? That was the fortune cookie message last week, when you weren't here, yes.

1071
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
How funny.

1072
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Alright, yeah, I thought Rama was calling in to give a review on something. Where is he?

1073
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Oh, because he's on the phone. Oops. Sorry, Rama. Love you.

1074
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
But we love the mailbag, too!

1075
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Mailbag. OrangeLunchRadio.com, which apparently we are doing this segment tonight, although I only saw one email in there when I went in earlier.

1076
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Saw us send an email.

1077
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Hello, OLR buddies and friends. It's actually titled Why Hello There, OLR.

1078
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I finally joined the new millennium and got an Xbox 360.

1079
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I've survived solely on DS and PSP for the longest time, and I have to say that it's nice to have a non-portable gaming system again for the first time in nearly three years.

1080
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:00,000
So far, I only have Guitar Hero 3 and Guitar Hero Aerosmith. My band's names are Spock's Eyebrows and Doodly Ladies, respectively.

1081
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,000
But I hope to remedy this soon. What are some good Xbox 360 games that I should look into purchasing?

1082
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Fable!

1083
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Fable 2 is kind of evil, but it is definitely entertaining. You can beat up chickens.

1084
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Please go on Xbox Live Arcade and look at all the sex that's on there, like Rez.

1085
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Symphony of the Night?

1086
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
If you don't already have that on PlayStation 1, definitely Symphony of the Night.

1087
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Go look at how much sex is available for cheap on Xbox Live Arcade. That's where you need to go.

1088
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:42,000
And, um, oh shoot, there's also, um, there's of course the Rock Band series, and, um, Brainfart.

1089
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Brainfart the game!

1090
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Guitar Hero?

1091
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
She already said she had them!

1092
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Oh yeah.

1093
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Okay.

1094
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So, moving forward, since Jamie mentioned playing Order of Ecclesia, I figured I would quickly plug the review I did of that game.

1095
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It's great! And can be found on my blog at www.avengerstower.com.

1096
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
The game is great, or the review is great?

1097
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Both.

1098
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Order of Ecclesia is definitely a very difficult game compared to earlier Castlevania games, but the difficulty of the game most certainly adds to the fun.

1099
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Anyway, OLR, take care of yourselves, and I'll quite possibly see you soon, as soon as next year, perhaps, eyebrow waggle.

1100
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Sincerely, Martin.

1101
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Take care of yourself and each other.

1102
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Real quick, and, you know, this kind of goes back to something we were talking about way earlier in the show.

1103
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Kunamata, that was on your release dates for coming out in the Asia regions, well, it's already been out in the Asia regions, but this is the English slash Chinese version.

1104
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
So, you could import this and play it in English.

1105
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Thought about it, it's only $49.90.

1106
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It's not bad.

1107
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Can't run over the animals, though, that is a downside.

1108
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Dope.

1109
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
We have more.

1110
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
All right, let's hear more.

1111
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
One of them tricked me!

1112
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
It said love, love, love, love, love, and I thought it was about me, but it was spam.

1113
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Bastards.

1114
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I hate those spammers.

1115
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
You know he should have F-ed?

1116
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
The one who stole your magnet off your car.

1117
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Oh, I forgot about that.

1118
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I had a rainbow all of his divine magnet on my car, and somebody stole it.

1119
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Oh, it's on the fridge right now.

1120
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Pissed me off.

1121
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Ugh.

1122
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Pissed me off.

1123
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
That's so messed up.

1124
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Moving forward.

1125
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Damn thieves!

1126
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Bastards!

1127
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I can't make a fist.

1128
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
This sucks.

1129
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Okay, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act of theft.

1130
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
A few weeks ago, I got Tales of Vesperia, and it's a pretty good game.

1131
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I recommend it.

1132
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Can I point out where we live?

1133
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
There's lots of friendly neighborhood Mexicans.

1134
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Actually, lots and lots.

1135
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Just wanted to say.

1136
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
But he's an actual, in Mexico, Mexican.

1137
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Alright, fair enough.

1138
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
And that makes him special.

1139
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
But that's not what I want to talk about.

1140
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I want to comment about how I got it for a cheaper price than it would have cost in the

1141
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
US, and what's curious about this is that I got it for full price.

1142
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Most games when sold in Mexico are ridiculously overpriced because of stupid import handling

1143
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
taxes, and to top it all off, most stores charge you even more and make games pretty

1144
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
much an expensive thing to invest in.

1145
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Except for those, like me, who live next to the US and can cross the border to buy stuff.

1146
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
With the most recent global economy crisis, the Mexican peso has lost its gain to the

1147
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
US dollar.

1148
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
But for gaming, it has meant a good thing rather than bad.

1149
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:40,000
When I bought Tales of Vesperia, I bought it for 7.55 pesos, which is the MSRP price

1150
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
for it down here.

1151
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Now, a dollar is worth 13.50 pesos, approximately.

1152
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
So doing the math, I sold the game and cost the equivalent of $55 US total.

1153
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
That's a savings of $5 US without added sales tax.

1154
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I marveled myself on how this crisis has caused at least one good thing.

1155
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Another example is Gears of War 2, which is a newer game.

1156
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,000
In the US, it costs $60, while in Mexico, it costs around 650 pesos.

1157
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Again, doing the math, the game's cost in Mexico is the equivalent of $47, approximately,

1158
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
$13 in savings.

1159
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
And there are other games that would cost less here than crossing the border.

1160
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Unfortunately, there are other games that still do cost more here than in the US, but

1161
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
like I said, it's because of store making up prices rather than giving us the real retail

1162
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
price.

1163
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Especially on Playstation and Nintendo games, since they don't have a real representation

1164
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
in Mexico or Latin America, unlike Microsoft, which does have it.

1165
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Oh well, that's all for now.

1166
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Kinda happy news in all this crisis stuff.

1167
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Sorry to Jamie who reads this email if there are any grammatical or spelling errors in

1168
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
it.

1169
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
You know what?

1170
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:57,000
You have better grammar and spelling than most people in America do.

1171
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Yeah, when you consider that English is not this gentleman's first language, from what

1172
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I understand.

1173
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I believe he said before Spanish is the native language.

1174
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
You're my freaking hero today.

1175
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
There you go.

1176
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
A very rare commendation from dark soccer.

1177
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
You don't get that very often in the mailbag statement.

1178
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Look at you.

1179
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Wear that badge with honor, my friend.

1180
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:20,000
We also got an email forwarded to us.

1181
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
There's a very long email in there.

1182
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
It is a very long email.

1183
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Email a statement for next week.

1184
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,000
But it was sent by one of our All Games listeners through All Games Radio.

1185
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:39,000
And I'll tell you what, because of the length of this and because it is actually a well

1186
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
thought out question, I'm going to post it on the forum.

1187
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Well, they wanted us to talk about it on the show.

1188
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
There was some question in there.

1189
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Look for a really short paragraph towards the bottom.

1190
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I'm trying to remember what it was about.

1191
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
What might be your thoughts regarding you as the consumer using LittleBigPlanet as an

1192
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
advertising self-promoting marketing tool?

1193
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Okay, let me give you the gist of the email because it is kind of long for air, but I

1194
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
did read it off air.

1195
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Basically, the emailer was wondering, he was listening to some other shows in All Games

1196
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
and this kind of crossed his mind and wanted to hear our take on it because I guess he's

1197
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
been pulling some different shows.

1198
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I'm glad I didn't put it on the forum then.

1199
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
No, it's a good question.

1200
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:21,000
LittleBigPlanet has this potential to be like a new medium for all this marketing.

1201
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,000
What's the potential for it or where do you see people using it?

1202
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,000
What do you think people could be using LittleBigPlanet for with all the marketing?

1203
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:36,000
To me, I kind of think, well, in a way, it's a little big planet I kind of compare to a

1204
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
new website.

1205
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Does that make sense?

1206
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Like a YouTube or iTunes or something.

1207
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I guess iTunes is really a website, but you know what I mean?

1208
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,000
If there is a way to sell your product on it, there will be people that want to do that.

1209
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It is the quote unquote American way after all, even though we have a worldwide audience.

1210
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
You know what I mean?

1211
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Capitalism is big all over the world.

1212
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Look at a site like YouTube.

1213
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
You have tons of people.

1214
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
At first, what was YouTube?

1215
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
YouTube was a way to pirate TVs and commercials.

1216
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
When they had to legitimize themselves, it became this really interesting way to kind

1217
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
of sell music and all this other stuff.

1218
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
iTunes.

1219
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Podcasting.

1220
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,000
When we signed up to do podcasting, it was people like us in their garages, in their

1221
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
basements with microphones talking about shit they liked.

1222
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Now it's hugely commercialized, and we're having a hard time staying afloat amongst

1223
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
all these.

1224
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I mean, we'll be here doing our thing for a long, long time, but we have a hard time

1225
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:36,000
getting recognized because you have all these commercial people out trying to tie it into

1226
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,000
their website, their TV shows, their TV networks that have very little to do with gaming, but

1227
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
they have video game podcasts anyways, and so on.

1228
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Is that the truth?

1229
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:54,000
It's very interesting that where there's a way, people will kind of sell it, and it's

1230
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
interesting that this email comes in.

1231
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Probably before, you have LittleBigPlanet talking about now that there's going to be

1232
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
the Luminous thing, and I think there was a big misconception this week that there was

1233
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
actually going to be a Luminous game inside LittleBigPlanet.

1234
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
That's not quite the case.

1235
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
It's that there's a LittleBigPlanet skin coming to Luminous.

1236
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Come to think of it, it really doesn't have anything to do with the whole thing you're

1237
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
talking about at all, except for the fact that where there is a way to tie it in to

1238
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:25,000
market something in a video game, it can be done, and I bet you for sure there's going

1239
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
to be people that go out there and try to sell their website, their band.

1240
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
True story.

1241
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I was playing Warcraft the other night, and there was a shout in one of the villages.

1242
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
I'm not even kidding.

1243
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
If you live in, I think it was Boston, if you live in Boston, come check out this show

1244
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
on Saturday night if you like this metal band.

1245
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I'm like, dude, how many people in this world of Warcraft might live in Boston?

1246
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Boston's a pretty big place.

1247
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I know it's a big place, but World of Warcraft is a really fucking big place.

1248
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
It's like 100 Bostons.

1249
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Do you remember in Animal Crossing when we could do the message in a bottle thing, and

1250
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
we could send them out to random people?

1251
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Yes.

1252
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And I put in our radio station there and was sending out bottles like freaking mad.

1253
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
That's pretty much us doing the same thing.

1254
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And something that's also not in the Wii version anymore.

1255
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Thank you very much, Nintendo.

1256
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Very true, very true.

1257
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I didn't even think about that, but you're right.

1258
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
People have been using video games to promote their shit for a long time.

1259
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
But we could actually have all of our villagers say orangestonesradio.com, and then when they

1260
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
move to other people's villages, they'll spread.

1261
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Okay, so the question was about LittleBigPlanet, though.

1262
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
But LittleBigPlanet makes it easy.

1263
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I'm surprised there is no OLR level on LittleBigPlanet yet.

1264
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
There probably ought to be.

1265
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I should probably get to work on that.

1266
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
We should have a contest.

1267
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:58,000
But it's also against the terms of service on LittleBigPlanet to promote websites using

1268
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
levels in the game.

1269
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Oh, jeez.

1270
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Yeah, seriously.

1271
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
What if you do it discreetly?

1272
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Because, look, Bobby has a level from the beta, and he does it discreetly.

1273
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
He does it, he promotes it without...

1274
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:14,000
And, granted, I don't think he put a lot of effort into level.

1275
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I think it was his way of exploring the game and being able to give the game a good review.

1276
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I don't think he ever kind of intended it to be the one and only thing he ever does.

1277
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
But he invested a fair amount of time into it, but he kind of did a real easy-ish type

1278
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
of level that kind of slyly worked in a plug for his show.

1279
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I think as long as you're not crazy about it, I bet they wouldn't have it.

1280
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:40,000
They were actually promoting a LittleBigPlanet fan community on there, and it got pulled.

1281
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Why is that so weird?

1282
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Yeah, it is stupid.

1283
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
They're getting a little stupid with that stuff.

1284
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
What are you laughing at over there?

1285
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:54,000
A picture that I got sent for the cover of Wolverine and Power Pack, number three.

1286
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Well, look, to go back to the email, definitely where there's a way to do it, people are going

1287
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
to do it.

1288
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,000
It's just a matter of time, but it's kind of interesting to see the moderation and how

1289
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,000
that's going to play into it, because it was very hard to moderate Animal Crossing.

1290
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I mean, look at the N-word snuck through on one of those cartridges.

1291
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Anyhow, I guess that's it for our show then.

1292
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Was that the last email too?

1293
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
It was indeed.

1294
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
All right.

1295
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Last email tonight, and if you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com.

1296
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
We're done.

1297
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
We're ready to get out of here.

1298
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
We've got the final thoughts tonight.

1299
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Oh.

1300
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Yeah.

1301
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Never mind, because it comes after.

1302
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Okay.

1303
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

1304
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I'm looking at this actual P90 tactical load-bearing vest, which is kind of neat, because I would

1305
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
work with my airsoft gun, even though it's meant for actual real guns.

1306
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
All right.

1307
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
DarkSakura, your final thought?

1308
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Deadpool's fucking funny.

1309
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
My final thought is I'm fucking funny.

1310
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Duncan.

1311
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Shut up.

1312
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Beckers, thanks for joining us tonight.

1313
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I know you didn't get to talk a whole lot, but I'm glad you and Jamie got to sit there

1314
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
in the corner and giggle like girls.

1315
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
It was fun.

1316
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
All right.

1317
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Do you have any final words for our listeners tonight?

1318
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
It's freaking cold here.

1319
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
It is cold here.

1320
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I'm sorry.

1321
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
All right.

1322
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
You should see what it's like in the summertime, though.

1323
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Trust me, this is better than the alternative.

1324
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
But we need to have Becky on when we have stupid parent stories.

1325
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Oh, boy.

1326
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Because we definitely need to hear from someone.

1327
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

1328
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
What?

1329
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
We didn't even mention that story.

1330
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Uh-oh.

1331
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
What?

1332
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Hold on.

1333
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Hold on.

1334
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
This is good.

1335
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
This is good.

1336
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
It was another game that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed.

1337
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Or another crime that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed for, and it had nothing to

1338
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
do with Grand Theft Auto at all.

1339
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:52,000
It had to do with children torturing animals.

1340
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Yes, that's right.

1341
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Apparently, the newest crime that Grand Theft Auto can get blamed for is hanging kittens

1342
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
with game controller cords after playing Grand Theft Auto.

1343
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Apparently, a pair of unsupervised boys, six and seven years old, stoned a kitten and then

1344
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
strung it up following a Grand Theft Auto session.

1345
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
They reportedly used the controller cable in lieu of a rope.

1346
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
And you're not talking about blowing the bong smoke in the kitty's face.

1347
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
No, no.

1348
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Oh, god, that's terrible.

1349
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
No.

1350
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Apparently, this happened in late October in Mesa, Arizona, and it says the investigation

1351
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,000
began when deputies went to the neighborhood of one of the two boys and found the kitten

1352
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
hanging by its neck from a backyard tree.

1353
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
The boys had apparently used the wire for the video game controller they were playing

1354
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Grand Theft Auto to hoist up the kitten.

1355
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
The animal's head had been injured by blows from rocks.

1356
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
You know, I'm thinking this goes a little bit beyond video games.

1357
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I'm thinking these kids are just really, really, really, really, really fucked up.

1358
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Hold on.

1359
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:09,000
But the county sheriff actually said, so one question, or what was it?

1360
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Who is this guy?

1361
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Arpeo.

1362
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I'm not sure if it's the boys' parents or something.

1363
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It says, this game allows players to kill cops and rape women.

1364
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:25,000
It's a little wonder why they perpetrated such violence against the little animal.

1365
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
YYR in our chat, it says the parents are to blame.

1366
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:33,000
They should have bought wireless controllers.

1367
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
It doesn't matter.

1368
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
They would have stoned it to death anyways.

1369
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Becker's just dying to say something.

1370
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Institutionalize your children.

1371
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
They're going to grow up to be serial killers.

1372
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
That has nothing to do with the video games.

1373
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
This is coming from a mom.

1374
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Parents, this has nothing to do with video games.

1375
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
This has everything to do with you.

1376
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Your genes did this.

1377
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Stop passing them on.

1378
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Your hell spawn, Damien Light, did this.

1379
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I agree with Becky, padded room.

1380
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Or just give them a hammer and leave them in a room by themselves.

1381
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Now can we end the show?

1382
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Can we end the show now?

1383
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
No.

1384
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Thank you for ending the show on Dead Kittens, you ass.

1385
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Hey, I gotta go home and hug my kitty.

1386
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1387
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1388
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I have one thing that will make it all better.

1389
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Cookies.

1390
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Yay, cookies.

1391
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
And on that note, we're going to go eat some cookies and end the show.

1392
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Good night.

1393
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Oh, and by the way, if you enjoy Orange on Trio,

1394
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
please tell two people you know about the program and help us spread the word,

1395
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
because as I mentioned earlier, it's really hard to stay afloat

1396
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
amongst all the commercialized and corporate shows out there.

1397
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Word of mouth, it rocks.

1398
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
And you rock when you leave us happy reviews.

1399
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And join us for live shows on all games radio Sunday nights at 6 o'clock.

1400
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
But if you can't, hey, listen to our recorded shows too.

1401
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Send us an email sometime, because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

1402
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
We'll see you next week.

1403
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
