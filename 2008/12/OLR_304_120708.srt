[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, Tekken 6 gets a date, Rock Band is set to go a little bit country, and is Cooking Mama taking up a new hobby?

2
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:36,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:48,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.

00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:50,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah.

8
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:51,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.

9
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:51,649
[SPEAKER_06]: You're back.

10
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:52,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back.

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,971
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

13
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:56,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And what an amazing two weeks off it's been.

14
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:57,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

15
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:57,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't rub it in.

16
00:00:57,914 --> 00:00:58,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

17
00:00:58,374 --> 00:00:59,395
[SPEAKER_06]: You've had all this time off.

18
00:00:59,475 --> 00:00:59,936
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

19
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:04,905
[SPEAKER_06]: We are a little late tonight in starting the show.

20
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:09,306
[SPEAKER_06]: This won't affect anybody listening to this on the podcast, except for the fact that podcasts have been going up extremely late lately.

21
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:10,447
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because we're all pregnant.

22
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:12,648
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, we're not all pregnant.

23
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:17,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me introduce Tech Master Loki, who I hope is not pregnant.

24
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:17,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus.

25
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:19,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you pregnant, Loki?

26
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:20,760
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I am not.

27
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:22,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, Tech Master Loki.

28
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:30,915
[SPEAKER_06]: We're starting a little late tonight, 7 o'clock Pacific, just because there's personal life things going on that have to... Real life, greater than gaming.

29
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:32,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob has PMS.

30
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:33,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have PMS.

31
00:01:33,158 --> 00:01:33,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having a baby.

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,240
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Also say hello to a special guest we have here tonight.

34
00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:41,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie has brought one of her friends here to giggle with us tonight on the show.

35
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:43,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to Becky.

36
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Greetings.

37
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:44,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

38
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have an online name you use, Becky, that you want people to call you?

39
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:48,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Beckers.

40
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:49,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Beckers.

41
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

42
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:51,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Beckers.

43
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,130
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me think of Beckham.

44
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:55,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Beckers.

45
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:58,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow... Yeah, but he married a hoochie.

46
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Posh Spice is pretty hot.

47
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:02,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hoochie!

48
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:02,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

49
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:05,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Beckers... Her boobs don't move!

50
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Beckers, what type of video games do you enjoy?

51
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:07,845
[SPEAKER_06]: You play a lot of video games?

52
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:08,526
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you like?

53
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:10,421
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

54
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:10,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I refuse.

55
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:39,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Refuse?

56
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:40,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

57
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,436
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you refuse?

58
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some rock band.

59
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:52,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Castlevania Order of Ecclesia and I'm very pissed off at it right now so I took a break because it's fucking hard.

60
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:54,282
[SPEAKER_06]: That is.

61
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:55,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the same problem.

62
00:02:56,243 --> 00:03:01,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to actually go back and re-level just on that first thing just because it's such a pain in the butt.

63
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:06,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got Animal Crossing and I have been beating my animals with the bug net.

64
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:08,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

65
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:13,610
[SPEAKER_03]: But I accidentally stole my shovel and stupid Nook, that butthead, won't get anyone in.

66
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,272
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I was telling Nellie, because there's this one stupid rabbit in her town named Francine.

67
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:21,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I know which one that is!

68
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that she absolutely hates.

69
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:32,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I said that we have to form a hit squad and just have everybody at Bug Nets all of a sudden chase her down, like, get her trapped in one of those pitfalls and just all four people hitting her at the same time.

70
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:34,637
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be hilarious.

71
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:36,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know who fucking showed up in my village?

72
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:37,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Who?

73
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Pearl, I hate her.

74
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:45,268
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a little cat that looks like, oh, God, she looks like she has, like, burn scars all over her face.

75
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:46,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she's in my village.

76
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Wolfgang.

77
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool.

78
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,352
[SPEAKER_03]: He's fucking awesome.

79
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:53,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe we're having this discussion about a game made for 12-year-olds.

80
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:54,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

81
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a bunny in my town.

82
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:57,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the lesbian to move back into my town.

83
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:58,518
[SPEAKER_06]: What was her name?

84
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that Barbara?

85
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,720
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Barbara was a sheep.

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,163
[SPEAKER_03]: She was a duck, I think, and had gym equipment in her house.

87
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:06,605
[SPEAKER_03]: So we put rainbow signs outside of her house.

88
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:25,385
[SPEAKER_03]: and she was our we put all kinds of happy signs and sent her letters and the bitch moved out I mean if that is not you know you think you know somebody and you move in after a month I'm sorry that's you know she just got pissy and moved out

89
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:30,192
[SPEAKER_06]: She probably moved in with her girlfriend after the second date, like most lesbians.

90
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:31,433
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was thinking.

91
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:36,355
[SPEAKER_03]: She moved out of my village because I got boring and wouldn't send her any more letters or peaches.

92
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And she moved out.

93
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:39,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitch.

94
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:41,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Lesbians are so needy.

95
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:42,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

96
00:04:43,323 --> 00:05:12,809
[SPEAKER_03]: and Dan's been playing Need for Speed Undercover and I've been mocking him because it's fun and easy and then even though it's not a video game I've been watching a lot of Supernatural which is more fun because I got to watch Jensen Ackles naked not completely but it was a lot more exciting than playing Animal Crossing

97
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:17,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind me, this is a show geared towards 16-year-old girls?

98
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:18,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell no!

99
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:21,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It is geared towards me.

100
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:23,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the CW.

101
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:24,458
[SPEAKER_03]: We forgive it.

102
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:25,058
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

103
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

104
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,979
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week was all right.

105
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched my wife play a lot of Animal Crossing because I'm not allowed near it, I guess.

106
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:34,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

107
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:56,520
[SPEAKER_07]: and there was like a bunch of stuff that she's done.

108
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,762
[SPEAKER_07]: She harasses her animals quite a bit.

109
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, do you know that now it censors things?

110
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:04,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you can't just have your animals say fuck.

111
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:09,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And like mine, I tried to get mine to say poop and it wouldn't say it.

112
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,388
[SPEAKER_06]: It said that word is not allowed.

113
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:11,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to tell you though.

114
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So now he says poop.

115
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:15,527
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

116
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,085
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the animals defaulted, their little catch word was the N word.

117
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:39,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

118
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:43,867
[SPEAKER_06]: But the way they got around it was they put N and then an I with an accent.

119
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:46,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, it was someone who, one of the programmers.

120
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:46,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

121
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they probably copied something to test it.

122
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,132
[SPEAKER_07]: They copied Ranma, someone that had already played it and unlocked all the stuff.

123
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:54,832
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it was.

124
00:06:56,073 --> 00:07:00,955
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, they, I don't know, should maybe look at that first, you know, do a little testing.

125
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:02,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's getting fired.

126
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,766
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

127
00:07:39,941 --> 00:08:07,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure but or 1400x900 not 1440 but it runs pretty good for me you know 40-50 frames per second and I have a lot of sliders put up all the way you know although I don't like the fact that this brand new game does not support SLI so that's kind of a waste and it's got to be patched in later on you know absolute laziness just to get it out

128
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:09,913
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

129
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,150
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

130
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard.

131
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, very, very hard.

132
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:41,531
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll fall off a building a lot.

133
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:46,213
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think people are pissed off because it's, you know, short.

134
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:53,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, sure, I guess it doesn't innovate much, but the way I look at it is, is it fun?

135
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:54,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

136
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So then what are you complaining about?

137
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, I'll have to play some more of that.

138
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:02,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear it is really short.

139
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,218
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I believe, what was it, um,

140
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:29,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Yotzi had reviewed it this week and man said he beat it in a day so it'll be interesting to see how long it takes me to finish it then I've got a bunch of other games on my plate in fact I got another one this week which I haven't even touched yet Prince of Persia so that looks pretty fun too so well lots of stuff

141
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:30,993
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, good times.

142
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:33,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my gaming week's been Animal Crossing.

143
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:36,315
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple weeks ago, I think I mentioned Animal Crossing, but didn't really get too far into it.

144
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:39,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I really spent some serious time with Animal Crossing on the Wii this week.

145
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:39,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

146
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:51,899
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as we're joking around and kind of talking about reliving the thrill of the GameCube version all over again, I have a real hard time recommending this game overall because it's just not enough new for me.

147
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And I kind of feel like there's Animal Crossing on the GameCube out there for much cheaper prices.

148
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,021
[SPEAKER_06]: and you almost get more in it.

149
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:01,344
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are some cool things in this game.

150
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:10,431
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem with this game is it feels like it's just a port of the DS version with a couple extra frills and it just kind of leaves an Animal Crossing fan really wanting more.

151
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:15,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they should have taken more risks with this game than they did.

152
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:18,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I will say the internet functionality works pretty cool.

153
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:25,864
[SPEAKER_06]: They have worked WeConnect24 into it a little bit so you don't really have to go to somebody's village to send letters and things of that nature which is an improvement over the DS version but

154
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:28,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is that really worth the whole new upgrade?

155
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:29,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so much.

156
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:48,597
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really do a whole lot.

157
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:52,999
[SPEAKER_03]: The city is for getting all of your special characters who only would randomly show up.

158
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,420
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so you can have the convenience of having them all the damn time.

159
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:58,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's stupid.

160
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Then that takes away the special part of it.

161
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:16,270
[SPEAKER_03]: No way, you still get presents floating on balloons, and you still get, you know, Gulliver, you know, showing up, and I'm actually, you know, Wild World didn't really hold me all that well, but this one's, I'm really digging it.

162
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:17,468
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's weird.

163
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:18,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of feel the same way.

164
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:21,410
[SPEAKER_06]: The DS one, I got really fast.

165
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,152
[SPEAKER_06]: But for some reason, I have been actually going back to the Wii one to kind of see if there's new stuff.

166
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:26,093
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's weird.

167
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I say all this, yet I can't in good conscience really recommend this game.

168
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:35,038
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to really be hardcore about these types of games to get a thrill out of this.

169
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:37,560
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to really be an Animal Crossing fan, of which I was.

170
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,681
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm still left wanting more.

171
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,903
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's my sit down for an hour and relax.

172
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:44,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

173
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:45,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I got wowed.

174
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:47,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Addict?

175
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob What?

176
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:18,771
[SPEAKER_06]: and the consensus overall amongst at least my guild, which is a casual raiding guild.

177
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,212
[SPEAKER_06]: We were never very hardcore about the endgame.

178
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:23,913
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the people from Final Fantasy XI still.

179
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,174
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the same people that were there have moved over here.

180
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:28,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Glenn and some of these people from old school.

181
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we haven't seen them in a few weeks.

182
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:33,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the turkey coma.

183
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,598
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

184
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:39,540
[SPEAKER_06]: We're rating ill.

185
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,068
[SPEAKER_06]: The general consensus is this expansion is better than the last one.

186
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, can you help me power level?

187
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:12,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I can try.

188
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:15,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a level 20-something priest.

189
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:18,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also been playing Ragnarok, and you can play that with me.

190
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:19,327
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

191
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:21,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a lot of games to play.

192
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:22,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you do.

193
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get you to level 100 in two hours.

194
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:26,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not joking.

195
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky, your voice like that, not sexy.

196
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:50,446
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

197
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:10,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you actually see him.

198
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:12,725
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a much better job with this expansion.

199
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:13,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they learned a lot from the last one.

200
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:29,314
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's the one thing I would really like to see in an MMO is that they have it function like an actual RPG where you have to do point A to point B to, you know, where your quests are not just, oh, look, this person has question mark over his head and I want...

201
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:29,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Money!

202
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:30,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

203
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:52,804
[SPEAKER_03]: It got really dull.

204
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:54,305
[SPEAKER_06]: You might also be on the wrong server.

205
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,345
[SPEAKER_06]: You should try a roleplay server on WoW.

206
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:56,985
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have fun.

207
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on a roleplay server, actually, and I didn't.

208
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:00,966
[SPEAKER_03]: No one stays in character.

209
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:02,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It's annoying.

210
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:03,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I just rather hang out with everybody.

211
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:09,149
[SPEAKER_07]: When you finally get the battle and defeat the Lich King, he'll be all, I have one last thing to say.

212
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:15,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget Guitar Hero 5 pre-orders and StarCraft 2 is right around the corner.

213
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

214
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:17,811
[SPEAKER_06]: You forgot Diablo 3.

215
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:19,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Diablo 3.

216
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:21,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Warcraft 4.

217
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how you tried to do your lazy bass echo.

218
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:27,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Lich King sounds like a drunken asshole.

219
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, how much have you really gotten to know the Lich King yet?

220
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:34,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, DJ Tyrant hit the nail on the head.

221
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,533
[SPEAKER_06]: The last expansion had nothing like Wrathgate.

222
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:40,935
[SPEAKER_06]: He says Wrathgate is one of absolutely the best questlines of all time.

223
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,276
[SPEAKER_06]: In-game cutscenes for the win.

224
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:45,137
[SPEAKER_06]: They have cutscenes in the quest this time, and they're epic.

225
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Epic cutscenes are very epic.

226
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wrathgate was hot.

227
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody in our guild, because we're all WoW nerds, was having a gigantic orgasm over the Wrathgate questline because it was awesome.

228
00:15:56,403 --> 00:16:01,787
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that sounds like it would be more fun to me just having actual story to follow.

229
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:05,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to spoil what happens in Wrathgate, but it's pretty amazing.

230
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty epic.

231
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:11,694
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to learn a little more about the phasing technology, and it's cool.

232
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:12,175
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

233
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:14,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobbie Blackwolf Show

234
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:37,016
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

235
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:53,989
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

236
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:15,758
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's actually going to be like they're going to do the interaction with the live crowd as well as the people in the chat room.

237
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:17,539
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds awesome.

238
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:19,479
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have some neat co-hosts and stuff too.

239
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how much more I can say because I don't know what he said yet.

240
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:24,722
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's going to be cool.

241
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:26,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So listen to it.

242
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:31,725
[SPEAKER_06]: FNGLive.net and that starts January 9th on All Games Radio.

243
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, that's really all the housekeeping I have tonight.

244
00:17:35,274 --> 00:17:38,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So how about some gaming news, even though it's been kind of a slow news week.

245
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:40,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So a short show seems appropriate tonight.

246
00:17:40,295 --> 00:17:40,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what's up?

247
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:48,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there is a certain Kingdom Hearts game that's scheduled to come out for the DS, and you may have heard about it.

248
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:56,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Kingdom Hearts 358 slash 2 days is going to be getting a North American release.

249
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:59,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, did anyone have...

250
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:00,538
[SPEAKER_07]: KINGDOM HEARTS 3

251
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:18,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Never.

252
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:19,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

253
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,256
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to whore it enough.

254
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:34,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Kingdom Hearts 2 you have to understand is like Final Fantasy 7 or the upcoming Final Fantasy 13 where it's got to have 90 billion versions for it first before they move on to the next one.

255
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they can whore that one out.

256
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:41,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to wear out the first prostitute first before they can move on to the next.

257
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:47,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want my Kingdom Hearts 3, though, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

258
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,474
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be very nice, with my high-def graphics and hopefully a working camera.

259
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:55,597
[SPEAKER_06]: But although Kingdom Hearts 2 wasn't bad, as far as the camera goes.

260
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Kingdom Hearts 2 was really solid.

261
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Kingdom Hearts 2 is a very solid game.

262
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:00,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Good time.

263
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:02,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to actually not glitch mine out.

264
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:03,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss games like that.

265
00:19:04,365 --> 00:19:05,086
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a little while.

266
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:06,587
[SPEAKER_06]: When did Kingdom Hearts 2 come out?

267
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:06,587
05?

268
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:07,668
[SPEAKER_06]: 06, maybe?

269
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:08,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.

270
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe 06.

271
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:15,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow, let's get into some other news and some other games that are dated that are highly anticipated.

272
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:17,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably another anticipated game by Jamie, Tekken 6.

273
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:26,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and it's been confirmed that it will be in the fall 2009 time frame.

274
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:36,083
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Xbox 360 is supposed to, I don't know if it's getting a slightly earlier launch or something, but they're going to hit generally at the same time, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

275
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:39,384
[SPEAKER_06]: This official announcement was made by Atari

276
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,886
[SPEAKER_06]: who is publishing the game over in Europe.

277
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:43,128
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it.

278
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:52,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not going to be in the same time frame as like Street Fighter 4 and we know there's not going to be a new Mortal Kombat next year because they just had one this year.

279
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So

280
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then, I don't know.

281
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,800
[SPEAKER_06]: They were putting out those Mortal Kombat games a dime a dozen for a little bit.

282
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,062
[SPEAKER_07]: They could still do another Mortal Kombat game because all they would really have to do is just port the engine over and add new characters.

283
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:03,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's face it.

284
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:09,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Mortal Kombat and Tekken have very, very different fan bases, so I don't think there's going to be any overlap there anyway.

285
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:10,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

286
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:10,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

287
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Tekken 6 coming soon.

288
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,427
[SPEAKER_06]: No mention about arcades, though.

289
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:15,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Sad.

290
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:17,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I weep for the arcade.

291
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, where is the market going?

292
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:20,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

293
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:21,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they do have the arcade version.

294
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:23,073
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be already out in Japan.

295
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:23,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

296
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:24,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.

297
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,116
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not coming over here.

298
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:26,796
[SPEAKER_03]: WeWare

299
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:54,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

300
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:55,414
[SPEAKER_06]: WiiWare.

301
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:56,574
[SPEAKER_06]: The stuff I'm boycotting.

302
00:20:57,335 --> 00:20:58,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, come on, Rob.

303
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,016
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

304
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:00,236
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

305
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:03,638
[SPEAKER_07]: They did promise that they'd have more storage, but where the fuck's the update?

306
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:04,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably March.

307
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,400
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just like Sony's Home.

308
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the fuck is Sony's Home?

309
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't play it, therefore it's not out yet.

310
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:12,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

311
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:19,425
[SPEAKER_06]: What can the more common folk, who are not stuck up enough to be boycotting the Nintendo Wii, what can they be playing?

312
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:23,486
[SPEAKER_03]: There are more games coming out.

313
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:34,051
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually going to be ArtStyle Roto Hex, that's a remake of the Bit Generations game Dial Hex, that was on the Game Boy Advance.

314
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:38,072
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually going to be 600 Wii points.

315
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:42,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode 4 of Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people on its way.

316
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:46,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will have the Danger-esque 3 theme.

317
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:48,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 1,000 Wii points.

318
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:52,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I will allow you to get the Strong Bad game because it's pretty awesome.

319
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:54,618
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do want to point out it's also available on PC.

320
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:56,779
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't want to put up with the Nintendo Wii.

321
00:21:58,259 --> 00:21:58,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

322
00:21:59,560 --> 00:21:59,840
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

323
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:08,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know when the hell they're doing an art-style version of DotStream, because that was the most kick-ass bit-generation game that they released.

324
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:11,809
[SPEAKER_07]: That and Sound Voyager, I guess, is supposed to be pretty good, but I never picked that one up.

325
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:21,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's also Bang, which is a shape-matching game, and Pit Crew Panic, which should make sense.

326
00:22:21,852 --> 00:22:23,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mechanics for broken things.

327
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,213
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one where you fix toilets.

328
00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:27,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, there's a giant toilet one.

329
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:28,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that sounds like fun.

330
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:31,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we talked about that a little bit.

331
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:35,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Oblivion, Beatmania, and Kingdom Hearts 2 were all released the same week.

332
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:59,904
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf wants to point out that Strong Bad is also cheaper on the PC.

333
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:00,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

334
00:23:01,845 --> 00:23:05,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And YYR in chat, I believe, is commenting on the Tekken 6 story.

335
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,789
[SPEAKER_06]: The arcade version will not be released in North America.

336
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:08,829
[SPEAKER_06]: They announced that a while back.

337
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:09,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember when.

338
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Selected arcades in the USA do have it.

339
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:13,312
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like three in New York.

340
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:13,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played it.

341
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:14,313
[SPEAKER_06]: It rocks.

342
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:17,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And there will be an upgrade called Bloodline Rebellion.

343
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:19,016
[SPEAKER_06]: All of that from YYR.

344
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:28,194
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to mention, since we're on the topic of WiiWare, Xbox Live Arcade will be getting Meteos Wars and Power Up Forever this week as well.

345
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:28,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

346
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:32,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Meteos, but I can't imagine not playing it with a stylus.

347
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:41,224
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi through the good times, like Luminous, and the bad times, like 99 Nights.

348
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:45,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that man, and I will get Meteos just because it's Q Entertainment.

349
00:23:47,388 --> 00:23:49,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I really liked the DS one.

350
00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:49,914
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of underrated.

351
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:50,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

352
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,783
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can't imagine not playing that game without the stylus, that's all.

353
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry.

354
00:23:59,024 --> 00:23:59,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

355
00:23:59,624 --> 00:24:01,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, other things that you can expect this week.

356
00:24:02,345 --> 00:24:05,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very short list, unfortunately, because it is this time of year.

357
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:08,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Most games have already been released for Christmas.

358
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:13,890
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are a few late additions, including Prince of Persia on the PC.

359
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's tardy to the party?

360
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:17,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's stumbling in hungover to the Christmas party?

361
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:20,233
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sonic Unleashed on PS3.

362
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:23,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of those versions coming out later.

363
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:24,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Neopets Puzzle Adventure Puzzle Quest

364
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Just with Neopets, does anyone still play Neopets?

365
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:59,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just talking about playing Neopets the other day because I miss playing the little games on the site.

366
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:00,290
[SPEAKER_03]: But you weren't playing them.

367
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking and doing are two different things though.

368
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:05,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

369
00:25:05,552 --> 00:25:09,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking about Neopets the other day in the mall when I was walking by Claire's.

370
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:10,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have Claire's nationwide?

371
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:11,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a nationwide chain?

372
00:25:11,675 --> 00:25:16,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so then you all know, well, for the international audience, Claire's is like the pretty, pretty princess store.

373
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:20,199
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the store for like 11-year-old girls who want to dress up like princesses.

374
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:37,485
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can stop with the comments right now about how much I love Claire's but I was looking in the window not in the store but in the window and they had all these Neopets things for sale and I was telling my friend I remember when I used to play Neopets damn I needed a life so that's all and you don't now

375
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, watch it.

376
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:43,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Core on DS, that'll be coming out.

377
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:51,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Hidden Expedition, Amazon, and The Tale of Despero, both on PC.

378
00:25:53,916 --> 00:26:01,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Other titles for this week, Slingo Quest on DS, Left Brain, Right Brain 2 on DS.

379
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:08,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Driver's Ed Portable, yes, you can practice your Driver's Ed tests on the DS now.

380
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Build the lot.

381
00:26:13,703 --> 00:26:16,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You can practice your, is it like just the written test on?

382
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:19,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

383
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:20,690
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, okay.

384
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:23,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I practice driving on Ridge Racer.

385
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:27,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Build a Lot, Ski and Shoot, Dungeon Maker 2, The Hidden War on PSP,

386
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:51,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Kate West, The Vanishing Files on DS, and of course the big one for the week, Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 on PS2.

387
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:55,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is the special edition that comes with the soundtrack.

388
00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:58,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Atlas is really hooking you up.

389
00:26:58,447 --> 00:26:58,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking rad?

390
00:27:00,027 --> 00:27:00,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

391
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:02,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

392
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to say that it's only going to get worse from here.

393
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:07,978
[SPEAKER_07]: The next few weeks are crap.

394
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:37,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts is going to be released over in Japan on December 11th as is Mirror's Edge in Japan on the Xbox 360.

395
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:42,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Also being released December 11th on the PlayStation 3, Hakuna Matata!

396
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:47,295
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually a general Asia release.

397
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:48,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Did that game ever get released here in the U.S.?

398
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:55,160
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's going to be released here under, I think Namco's doing it, under National Geographic Africa.

399
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's a better name.

400
00:27:57,702 --> 00:28:00,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Did that game get a facelift all of a sudden, didn't it?

401
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're changing it up for here.

402
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:04,707
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not coming over here for a while, though.

403
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:07,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see animals eating each other.

404
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:10,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Hakuna Matata gets the general Asia release.

405
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,633
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an English-Chinese version, so you could import it, technically, December 11th.

406
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to see the monkeys throw poo and do it.

407
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:21,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can import the UK version, which I believe is in English and I think is already out.

408
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:22,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go.

409
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:27,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Mina No Golf 5 gets a price reduction this week, this Friday.

410
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:28,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Mirror's Edge also comes to the PlayStation 3.

411
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And Virtua Fighter also gets a price reduction.

412
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:36,026
[SPEAKER_06]: And a localized version of WALL-E, the video game, on PlayStation 3.

413
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:38,848
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the Disney movie, WALL-E.

414
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:44,512
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Wii, Cooking Mama, Minato Isho ni Aoyoi Takai.

415
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,093
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a price reduction.

416
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:48,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Fancy name for Cooking Mama 2.

417
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:51,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, the Wii edition, comes out this week.

418
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:54,240
[SPEAKER_06]: It has this face breaker and major Wii.

419
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And Samba de Amigo comes out as well.

420
00:28:57,343 --> 00:28:59,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Taiko no Tatsujin also gets a Wii release.

421
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we have some Taiko fans from the music game folks.

422
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:06,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, also, Dark Sakura, are you listening?

423
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,391
[SPEAKER_06]: December 11th, Japan.

424
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:07,571
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

425
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:11,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Cross Generation of Heroes comes out.

426
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:16,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might want to be looking into imports pretty soon.

427
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:22,039
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 2, Galaxy Angel 2 gets a price reduction.

428
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,920
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

429
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I think most of our listeners are probably going to be looking for Shimogami Tensei Persona 4.

430
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:30,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Call it a hunch.

431
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:31,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no!

432
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:32,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, that's the US release.

433
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:33,005
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

434
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes some US states sneak into my list here.

435
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:38,068
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

436
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:41,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have dates for our UK people.

437
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:05,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Return the ferret, I command thee.

438
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I will put it like on a bungee cord.

439
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:11,093
[SPEAKER_06]: You do need to put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it, you can yank it back.

440
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:12,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bungee ferret.

441
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I should be encouraging you to do this.

442
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:20,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for... You know, there was a totally random conversation that we had yesterday.

443
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:21,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

444
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:22,458
[SPEAKER_03]: But did it involve ferrets?

445
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:23,599
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it didn't involve ferrets.

446
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,719
[SPEAKER_07]: It involved small animals.

447
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,320
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about that they should... Wow.

448
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,162
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about that they should breed like micro monkeys and call them like munkins.

449
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:32,063
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be funny.

450
00:30:32,143 --> 00:30:32,243
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

451
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:34,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where that came from.

452
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:37,266
[SPEAKER_07]: We were at a really boring Christmas party at my dad's house.

453
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of alcohol.

454
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:41,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's eat sugar and brainstorm.

455
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:45,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you know what they need to do?

456
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:53,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and all this good Xbox Live thing, shouldn't they have a game called Bungie Ferret Tossing?

457
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,376
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be like Orange Launch Radio presents Bungie Ferret Tossing.

458
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:59,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Add this to the list of Orange Launch Radio dream games.

459
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,977
[SPEAKER_06]: No, add this to the list of Orange Launch Radio reality games.

460
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:05,098
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to tell Becky about the dream games.

461
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:07,439
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to learn how to program or something.

462
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:09,639
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a series of games that we're mentally developing.

463
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,520
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you're in school.

464
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a class on programming.

465
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn it!

466
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:16,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Absorb via osmosis.

467
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,231
[SPEAKER_03]: You can learn it.

468
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:19,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, sorry.

469
00:31:19,452 --> 00:31:20,172
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a towel.

470
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:22,994
[SPEAKER_06]: UK dates, please.

471
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:26,676
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 11th, Luminous Supernova on PlayStation 3.

472
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:29,357
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me go squee and get happy in places.

473
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,099
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 12th, some stuff.

474
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:35,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince of Persia for PC, The Magic Roundabout.

475
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:40,684
[SPEAKER_03]: For people in America who don't know what a roundabout is, Traffic Circle.

476
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:42,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

477
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:19,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob is red.

478
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:21,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

479
00:32:21,802 --> 00:32:22,643
[SPEAKER_03]: This show sucks.

480
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:24,226
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck.

481
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:28,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Laughter is warm, and we're not.

482
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And also coming out, your mom the game.

483
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:31,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.

484
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:01,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully your mom the game lasts longer than Mirror's Edge.

485
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:03,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Longer than the player.

486
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

487
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:05,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I...

488
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:09,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

489
00:33:30,563 --> 00:33:31,244
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

490
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:49,743
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying to get guys to play.

491
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:52,806
[SPEAKER_07]: First they get them cooking and then they get them planting stuff in the garden.

492
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:55,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute, this is some type of secret plot, isn't it?

493
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,751
[SPEAKER_06]: To get men to do the things that women are supposed to be doing.

494
00:33:59,091 --> 00:33:59,691
[SPEAKER_06]: What's next?

495
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:00,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Laundry Mama?

496
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:03,935
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually... I will not stand for it.

497
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:05,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry, Mama will wash it.

498
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:10,300
[SPEAKER_07]: The next one was... What was it?

499
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:12,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Pet City Mama.

500
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:14,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something to do with pets, though.

501
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Pet Shop Mama.

502
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,294
[SPEAKER_06]: PoopScoopMama

503
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:35,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But food is delicious, and some pets are tasty.

504
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:44,164
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a little strange that Cooking Mama will work in the pet shop part-time, and then she cooks things, and PETA has a problem with it the other half of the time.

505
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:44,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

506
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:47,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that PETA thing was bullshit.

507
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:47,907
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

508
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:49,448
[SPEAKER_06]: You were gone when all that went down.

509
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:50,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

510
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember I posted on my Twitter.

511
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,892
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the week we were all off, was the PETA thing.

512
00:34:54,932 --> 00:34:56,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted on my Twitter about this.

513
00:34:56,854 --> 00:35:01,498
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we talked about it briefly last week on the show, and I was like, if Jamie was here, she'd say it's bullshit.

514
00:35:02,446 --> 00:35:03,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bullshit!

515
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:06,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you, PETA.

516
00:35:07,968 --> 00:35:11,329
[SPEAKER_03]: My preemptive F you goes to PETA.

517
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:14,030
[SPEAKER_03]: May you get fucked with a steak.

518
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:22,053
[SPEAKER_03]: A big, bloody, cow rib.

519
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:26,134
[SPEAKER_06]: We're really mature here on Orange Lounge Radio.

520
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Loki, did she really just said go fuck yourself with a steak?

521
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:32,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I not mistaking?

522
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:33,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I did hear that.

523
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,220
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

524
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:37,983
[SPEAKER_03]: With ribs.

525
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:40,925
[SPEAKER_06]: R.I.B.B.S.

526
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:09,737
[SPEAKER_06]: America's Army, obviously, you know, the game is free to play.

527
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:15,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a fairly popular game, you know, because it's, again... It's pretty old, too.

528
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:17,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the last game that they put out sucked.

529
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:18,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, get this.

530
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:30,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here in Rancho Cordova, where we tape our show, a suburb of Sacramento, where the OLR Studios is, not even that far from where we tape, only like one exit up the freeway, there was a U.S.

531
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:34,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Army video game tournament for the game America's Army that happened right here in our neck of the woods.

532
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:36,028
[SPEAKER_06]: www.DarkSakura.com

533
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,123
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

534
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:27,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone under 17 had to have a parent or guardian there in order to compete in the tournament.

535
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And sign up for the milter.

536
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,834
[SPEAKER_06]: If we had known it was going on, we would have gone out there.

537
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:32,536
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I would not have.

538
00:37:32,737 --> 00:37:34,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have played.

539
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:38,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think people think of Orange Lounge Radio when they think of America's Army.

540
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:39,044
[SPEAKER_06]: They think of the O.L.

541
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:39,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Army.

542
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually not the type of game we cover, but I would have gone out there.

543
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:43,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to kind of check it out.

544
00:37:43,946 --> 00:37:45,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see what SSJ100Matt said in the chat room?

545
00:37:46,406 --> 00:37:46,586
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

546
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:48,807
[SPEAKER_03]: The winner of the tournament gets to go to Iraq.

547
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:55,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like a twisted version of, you know, what the hell was that?

548
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:59,188
[SPEAKER_07]: God, why am I drawing a blank now?

549
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:00,049
[SPEAKER_07]: 80s movie.

550
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:01,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Last Starfighter.

551
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:03,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, The Last Starfighter was awesome.

552
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:06,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's like The Last Starfighter, just more death.

553
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got

554
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:12,987
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine in Iraq right now, and I would not want anyone to go over there.

555
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:21,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And to go back to what I was talking about when she was mentioning Runabout, or Roundabout or whatever.

556
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Roundabout.

557
00:38:22,151 --> 00:38:29,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the game I was thinking was called Runabout, and it was, yeah, the US title was Felony 1179.

558
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:30,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun game.

559
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:36,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a bus stuck in a subway tunnel in that game, and it spun out of control until it took off like a helicopter.

560
00:38:36,696 --> 00:38:36,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

561
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:40,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to say that the game was glitchy or anything.

562
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times, good times.

563
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,176
[SPEAKER_06]: How about some more gaming news?

564
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:45,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I gotta?

565
00:38:46,438 --> 00:38:46,878
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta.

566
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:52,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is actually some pretty good news for all of our Suikoden fans.

567
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:53,966
[SPEAKER_03]: All 108 of you.

568
00:38:58,029 --> 00:38:58,709
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a joke there.

569
00:38:59,289 --> 00:38:59,890
[SPEAKER_03]: See if you can spot it.

570
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even played the damn game and I get the joke.

571
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to Shane, thank you.

572
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:14,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But for all of our friends in Europe, Suiko Den, I guess it's pronounced T-Christ, is coming out on the DS in March next year.

573
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:25,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically the game is, you start off as this unnamed person who's in a security force who has to recruit 108 heroes to battle the One King.

574
00:39:25,918 --> 00:39:26,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

575
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:49,664
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have a four person party and it's Suikoden and you can go over the Wi-Fi to send characters into different games or other worlds so they can get new items, different quests, meet new people and this one actually just came out in Japan and we here in America are supposed to be getting it in February.

576
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:54,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But sorry people in Europe, you've got to wait.

577
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:55,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Or import!

578
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:56,328
[SPEAKER_06]: with tactics and stuff.

579
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:14,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

580
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:57,613
[SPEAKER_07]: of course you know their Q Entertainment is known for their games that kind of blend in you know pretty cool musical aspects to it so making I don't know a musical game it's not necessarily a bad thing and not really unexpected something else to look forward to I guess I guess we'll find out a little bit more about this later on I would be more worried if it was called LLQJ nice

581
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had sugar today, Rob.

582
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:02,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And how.

583
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:03,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And how.

584
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:05,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hey, I'm all over this.

585
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:08,667
[SPEAKER_06]: You talk music, you talk Mizuguchi, Q Entertainment.

586
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:11,689
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I'm going to check it out because I'm a whore for everything that man puts out.

587
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:16,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know I'm excited about this one if I didn't already have everything that this is going to be offering.

588
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:21,553
[SPEAKER_06]: But Atari is going to be bundling several of Mizuguchi's games together.

589
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:29,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Res HD, Luminous Live, and Every Extend to Extra Extreme are all going to be retailed together in one retail package.

590
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:35,563
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be called Q3, which is supposed to be some type of term meaning cubed, I guess, whatever.

591
00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:39,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could do San Q3, thank you.

592
00:41:40,486 --> 00:41:41,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a cute idea.

593
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:44,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was the same pun with QQQ.

594
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:45,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

595
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,411
[SPEAKER_03]: SonQ, thank you.

596
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:48,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it, I get it.

597
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:52,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can also do, I mean, you know, the third power is Q being something, so.

598
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:53,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

599
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:54,655
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's cute.

600
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:56,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, I didn't even think of the SonQ thing.

601
00:41:56,796 --> 00:41:57,357
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cute.

602
00:41:57,897 --> 00:42:05,221
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, you know, I'm sure a lot of our listeners probably already downloaded these games, but this is good news for those that are the more casual Xbox 360 people that don't take it online.

603
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:05,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I would get this.

604
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean... Because we haven't downloaded all this yet.

605
00:42:07,783 --> 00:42:09,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Then here's your perfect opportunity, because...

606
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:10,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

607
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:32,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to save very much.

608
00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:33,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see a price point listed here.

609
00:42:33,943 --> 00:42:35,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably worth all the download content for Loomis.

610
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:41,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, with the download content included, I think this is actually a pretty good package deal.

611
00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:45,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It saves you time and effort, really, if just that.

612
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:46,593
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

613
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:05,882
[SPEAKER_06]: True, true.

614
00:43:06,102 --> 00:43:06,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that helps.

615
00:43:07,023 --> 00:43:07,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Works out.

616
00:43:07,603 --> 00:43:13,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, there's no reason for me to get this because I always bottle this shit the first day it came out.

617
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:18,166
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm glad to see that there's enough faith in the product that they're giving it a retail release.

618
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:23,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who would have thought years ago when Rez was on Dreamcast it was kind of a cult title?

619
00:43:23,548 --> 00:43:24,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, not everybody really knew about it.

620
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:28,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knew that it would be kind of resurfacing in the mainstream again today?

621
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,770
[SPEAKER_06]: If that makes any sense.

622
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

623
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of wish they'd do a true sequel to Rez.

624
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:33,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't that be hot?

625
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:33,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

626
00:43:34,591 --> 00:43:35,612
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

627
00:44:03,984 --> 00:44:07,387
[SPEAKER_03]: They are already, Gordon Chan is directing it.

628
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:12,711
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not too many details, but they're sad.

629
00:44:13,632 --> 00:44:16,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is basically what was put out saying about it.

630
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:22,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like the King of Fighters movie will introduce a new science fiction spin into the setting.

631
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:27,024
[SPEAKER_03]: That right there is enough to make me vomit.

632
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:30,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Fighters in Space

633
00:44:47,766 --> 00:44:50,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the crap they tried to do with the last Mortal Kombat movie.

634
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:53,731
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't ruin my movie, please.

635
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:59,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ruin... King of Fighters was like classic staple in fighting games for me.

636
00:44:59,937 --> 00:45:12,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I grew as a gamer when King of Fighters came out and expanded my mental universe and made me realize that, yes, SNK can do a good fighting game other than Samurai Shodown.

637
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:22,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And what kind of cherished childhood memory would it be if they didn't come and rape it later on in a movie form?

638
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:26,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least it's not being directed by Uwe Boll, so that's good.

639
00:45:26,914 --> 00:45:29,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm glad I have something to be thankful for this holiday season.

640
00:45:30,215 --> 00:45:35,556
[SPEAKER_03]: But stars in the movie are Maggie Q, Sean Ferris, William Lee, and Ray Park.

641
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:36,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Who?

642
00:45:37,217 --> 00:45:37,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, Ray Park.

643
00:45:38,217 --> 00:45:39,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Darth Maul!

644
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:39,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Darth Maul, yes.

645
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:40,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And Seth Rogen.

646
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:41,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And what?

647
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:42,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And Toad.

648
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:42,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Toad, eh.

649
00:45:45,728 --> 00:45:47,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad?

650
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing that happens to everything else.

651
00:45:52,112 --> 00:45:53,873
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome when Storm said it.

652
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:55,554
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't.

653
00:45:55,574 --> 00:45:56,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it wasn't.

654
00:45:56,235 --> 00:45:57,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It really, really wasn't.

655
00:45:57,155 --> 00:46:04,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, do not get this couch started on Halle Berry and how much ass she sucks.

656
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:07,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but Jamie Catwoman.

657
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:07,802
[SPEAKER_06]: No, wait.

658
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:10,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I've blocked that out of my memory.

659
00:46:10,857 --> 00:46:12,837
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not exist as a part of my universe.

660
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:14,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it could be worse, okay?

661
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:17,899
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have had Tyra Banks play the part or something like that.

662
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:21,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Tyra Banks has more personality, thank you.

663
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,381
[SPEAKER_06]: She would have brought the much-needed sass to the part.

664
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:25,922
[SPEAKER_03]: She would have brought the sass and she would have brought...

665
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:27,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

666
00:46:49,335 --> 00:46:50,075
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the gut to?

667
00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:50,935
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the gut to?

668
00:46:50,995 --> 00:46:51,696
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the gut to?

669
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:52,496
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the gut to?

670
00:46:52,516 --> 00:46:52,916
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the gut to?

671
00:47:19,346 --> 00:47:20,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty Game

672
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:49,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, they're going to do something a little different with the next Tony Hawk game, which apparently is going to not be played with a controller.

673
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:57,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And will be a game that you're not going to be playing with a controller in your hands, according to them.

674
00:47:57,942 --> 00:48:05,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, what everybody's been speculating, the rumors have been around for a long time now, that it's going to be actually some sort of motion-controlled skateboard thing.

675
00:48:06,046 --> 00:48:08,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, at that point, I have to ask...

676
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you just go skateboard then?

677
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:14,841
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not actually going to be playing with a controller, just go skateboard.

678
00:48:14,881 --> 00:48:18,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you're almost there anyways, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper.

679
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:19,082
[SPEAKER_03]: But air conditioning.

680
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:20,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Carpet.

681
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:23,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

682
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:25,404
[SPEAKER_07]: But still.

683
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:27,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Skateboarding.

684
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:34,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, once you get to the point where it's so much like the thing that you're doing that you're actually doing it, you might as well just go actually do the sport.

685
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:45,479
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm sure I forgot to mention that they're probably going to be pumping out four more Guitar Hero games because they haven't buried that into the ground enough yet.

686
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:47,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and Bizarre Creations.

687
00:48:48,321 --> 00:48:51,344
[SPEAKER_07]: You may remember them from the Project Gotham racing series.

688
00:48:51,984 --> 00:48:58,570
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually working on another racing game as well that's going to be racing and driving focused.

689
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:01,252
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because that would be any other racing game.

690
00:49:01,893 --> 00:49:01,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

691
00:49:03,658 --> 00:49:09,199
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're also working on one that's going to be similar to Mario Kart meets Forza.

692
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,140
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

693
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario Kart meets Forza?

694
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:19,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's like a Mario Kart type of game, but you actually tune your cards and what weapons and stuff are on it and that kind of thing.

695
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:21,142
[SPEAKER_07]: How about a cute Forza game?

696
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:21,942
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be cute.

697
00:49:22,122 --> 00:49:28,744
[SPEAKER_03]: They already got Coral Q. You know, if you want your cute racer, buy the Coral Q franchise.

698
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:46,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see that they're actually putting out, and I don't know why they've done this over here, apparently EA doesn't know how to make games for the Wii, but they've decided that the next best idea to bringing NASCAR to the Wii instead of actually, I don't know, bringing NASCAR to the Wii is NASCAR Karts?

699
00:49:47,177 --> 00:49:47,417
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

700
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:50,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's like Mario Kart with NASCAR drivers.

701
00:49:52,577 --> 00:49:53,157
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sad.

702
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:18,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, while Loki was reading us that last little story there, I actually was working on my portal that lets us peer inside Dark Sakura's alternate universe.

703
00:50:18,254 --> 00:50:18,554
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

704
00:50:18,774 --> 00:50:24,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually have a clip from Dark Sakura's alternate universe where Tyra Banks is Storm.

705
00:50:25,117 --> 00:50:29,900
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I'm going to show you how fantastic my underwear make me feel.

706
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:51,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I really feel crazy standing up here in my underwear.

707
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:56,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to doing this on, you know, a Victoria's Secret runway or in a catalog, but not on The Tyra Show.

708
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:57,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need a little help.

709
00:50:58,212 --> 00:51:03,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, on the count of one, two, three, I want you to lose those under the canopy robes right now.

710
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:05,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Free that underwear, everybody!

711
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,152
[SPEAKER_07]: This is too much tire for this show.

712
00:51:19,472 --> 00:51:23,094
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the best parts coming up.

713
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:25,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Lord.

714
00:51:28,158 --> 00:51:33,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Because today, today is a panty party!

715
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:36,543
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a panty party.

716
00:51:36,863 --> 00:51:37,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Panty party.

717
00:51:40,345 --> 00:51:50,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, if it was possible for this show to get any more uber gay, it just jumped the pink shark.

718
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to point out that's one minute of your time you can never have back.

719
00:51:58,734 --> 00:52:00,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.

720
00:52:00,315 --> 00:52:02,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And how is this part of the gamer lifestyle?

721
00:52:02,776 --> 00:52:03,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

722
00:52:03,296 --> 00:52:09,459
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing really good because we have not discussed food.

723
00:52:12,768 --> 00:52:14,129
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

724
00:52:42,233 --> 00:52:42,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

725
00:53:11,417 --> 00:53:12,218
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Hero DJ Tiesto

726
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:29,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Dance, trance, kind of scene.

727
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:29,834
[SPEAKER_06]: So, very excited.

728
00:53:29,854 --> 00:53:30,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Dancey trancey.

729
00:53:57,157 --> 00:54:09,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Also should be noted, Paul Oakenfold apparently has seen the game, and that was kind of news that came out previously, but no word on whether he's on the soundtrack, but that would be quite a list of... I'd probably have to buy it then.

730
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm already thinking Testo's pretty awesome.

731
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:14,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tigerclaw is quick to point out, because I know he loves this kind of music.

732
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:18,754
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy was number two on the DJ Mag Top 100 of 2008.

733
00:54:18,974 --> 00:54:25,639
[SPEAKER_06]: He got beat out by Armin van Buren, who, by the way, if I remember right, if memory serves me right, was in Beatmania 2DX7 style.

734
00:54:27,844 --> 00:54:29,045
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that for useless knowledge?

735
00:54:30,046 --> 00:54:31,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, go sign you up for Jeopardy.

736
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:32,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently.

737
00:54:33,388 --> 00:54:34,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I love Jeopardy.

738
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,951
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you threaten Alex Trebek for us.

739
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:41,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when I lose, I'll sing, I lost on Jeopardy, baby.

740
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:47,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And you just respond to everything Alex Trebek says with, Well played, Trebek.

741
00:54:51,102 --> 00:54:52,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your mother, Trebek.

742
00:54:54,345 --> 00:54:55,406
[SPEAKER_06]: More news, then calls.

743
00:54:55,922 --> 00:54:59,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, how about Lips?

744
00:55:01,067 --> 00:55:05,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the mic that's coming out with Lips works for Rock Band 2.

745
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:06,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Will.

746
00:55:08,915 --> 00:55:12,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, is Will... That's a sexy microphone, by the way.

747
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:14,020
[SPEAKER_06]: That Lips microphone is very cute.

748
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It glows.

749
00:55:16,061 --> 00:55:18,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe I left this out of my gaming week.

750
00:55:18,923 --> 00:55:19,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're talking about.

751
00:55:19,864 --> 00:55:20,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought SingStar ABBA!

752
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:26,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I only got to play it for like five minutes because singing by yourself is no fun.

753
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:32,452
[SPEAKER_03]: But SingStar ABBA... We need to do... After the show.

754
00:55:33,152 --> 00:55:33,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show it.

755
00:55:34,613 --> 00:55:36,014
[SPEAKER_06]: After the show, I'll show you SingStar ABBA.

756
00:55:36,134 --> 00:55:36,815
[SPEAKER_06]: It's magnificent.

757
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:37,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Becky sings fantastic.

758
00:55:38,196 --> 00:55:39,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, let me tell you this though, listeners.

759
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:42,558
[SPEAKER_06]: You already know how you would feel about SingStar ABBA.

760
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:43,199
[SPEAKER_06]: You already know.

761
00:55:44,158 --> 00:55:44,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Abba, Abba, Abba, Abba

762
00:56:04,715 --> 00:56:30,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually at Best Buy a few times this weekend looking and just going through like their music section music game section and it's funny all the stuff that they have for Rock Band available they actually sell the ion drums there in store which is kind of crazy but you know what else I saw right underneath those ion drums that I was like for half a second going huh maybe I should the Rock Band stage kit

763
00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:34,491
[SPEAKER_07]: with the fog machine, and the lights.

764
00:56:54,093 --> 00:56:56,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

765
00:57:23,697 --> 00:57:25,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire drill, bye.

766
00:57:25,299 --> 00:57:26,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Question from the chatroom.

767
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:27,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Acidic Vampire wants to know about Sing Star Abba.

768
00:57:27,921 --> 00:57:30,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there harmonized duets in Sing Star Abba?

769
00:57:30,724 --> 00:57:32,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'd rather be Frida.

770
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:33,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.

771
00:57:34,908 --> 00:57:42,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I think three of the songs were duets, but again, I was playing it by myself because I was sad and lonely and playing Sing Star Abba by myself.

772
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:43,437
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it would take a chance on you?

773
00:57:43,817 --> 00:57:44,017
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

774
00:57:44,418 --> 00:57:46,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, I got like...

775
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

776
00:58:02,911 --> 00:58:09,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that I've been saying, and I'm not really a big fan of it, but something that I'm saying that they should have done from the get-go with Rock Band.

777
00:58:10,902 --> 00:58:20,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band country music is going to be coming out, or at least some country download tracks will be coming out on December 16th.

778
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:31,180
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're going to have, it doesn't really say yet what songs they're going to be, but the report, apparently they're claiming that there's going to be five songs as part of the pack.

779
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:38,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Names include, let's look at it, Bentley, Brad Paisley, Brooks and Dunn, Miranda Lambert, and the Dixie Chicks as artists.

780
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:44,527
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I do think that they should have download content for country music in the game because...

781
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:52,811
[SPEAKER_07]: There are people that like country music and they want to play that kind of stuff in Rock Band, and the download content's optional, so why not?

782
00:58:53,551 --> 00:58:55,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also think they should have more heavy metal in there.

783
00:58:57,853 --> 00:59:03,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know, I do think that it's a good idea, though, to do the country content like that, because, I mean...

784
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:09,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, country music is not all the boring crap it was when I was a little kid.

785
00:59:09,903 --> 00:59:13,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got some pretty difficult, I would say, difficult guitar out there.

786
00:59:13,765 --> 00:59:16,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I do agree, we need a lot more metal.

787
00:59:16,747 --> 00:59:20,530
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love the joystick posts that they were talking about, the different things.

788
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:23,371
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take a moment to read the man, Jolene.

789
00:59:24,672 --> 00:59:25,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

790
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:29,415
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're saying, who's going to mow your grass and the gambler?

791
00:59:29,596 --> 00:59:29,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I am 26.

792
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything Kenny Rogers is fine with me.

793
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:34,816
[SPEAKER_07]: The Gambler would be awesome.

794
00:59:34,836 --> 00:59:35,856
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Islands in the Stream?

795
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:38,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about that.

796
00:59:38,477 --> 00:59:39,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, give me anything, Dolly.

797
00:59:40,558 --> 00:59:41,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Dolly Parton is the woman, okay?

798
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:45,221
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, I bet this is them feeling the waters for a future...

799
00:59:46,738 --> 00:59:48,059
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

800
01:00:07,695 --> 01:00:14,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I would totally dig having some... I actually would pretty much dig the Brooks and Dunn content.

801
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love some Alan Jackson.

802
01:00:17,382 --> 01:00:18,963
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be freaking rad.

803
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:23,426
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would also, though, like to see them... This is my thought.

804
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:31,211
[SPEAKER_03]: If the country content does well, then maybe they should expand and do some jazz content.

805
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:35,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Do... Don't give me that look.

806
01:00:35,194 --> 01:00:35,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

807
01:00:35,914 --> 01:00:39,097
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was just thinking Karaoke Revolution did a country version, right?

808
01:00:39,477 --> 01:00:43,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when Karaoke Revolution got so popular that they did a country spin-off of that?

809
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:52,229
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was thinking they should do other styles, because they're really sticking into that broad category of rock, as in the classic rock to hard rock.

810
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:55,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I could do less punk and rock music.

811
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:58,354
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's plenty of it, that's the thing.

812
01:00:58,414 --> 01:01:00,917
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty of rock music, plenty of punk music,

813
01:01:02,738 --> 01:01:06,359
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really kind of starting to do that Scott stuff.

814
01:01:06,399 --> 01:01:07,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what you'd call it.

815
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:10,499
[SPEAKER_03]: They did give us Rush, and that made me happy.

816
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:12,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I am all over that No Doubt album next week.

817
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, but I'm ready to party like it's 1995.

818
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:19,581
[SPEAKER_06]: With that whole OJ verdict and everything this week, it's like 1995 all over again.

819
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:20,221
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I know.

820
01:01:20,341 --> 01:01:20,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that awesome?

821
01:01:20,861 --> 01:01:21,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.

822
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:24,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to just get out my Beanie Babies and Pogs and just have a day.

823
01:01:26,022 --> 01:01:26,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd.

824
01:01:26,862 --> 01:01:28,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to Jagged Little Pill, watch some Apollo 13.

825
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:29,703
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 1995 of them and her.

826
01:01:34,615 --> 01:01:35,996
[SPEAKER_03]: 1995 was Radiohead for me, sorry.

827
01:01:37,336 --> 01:01:37,916
[SPEAKER_06]: That works too.

828
01:01:38,476 --> 01:01:48,659
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, we should do a list list one day of non-rock songs we want to hear in Rock Band.

829
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:50,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I could get a little crazy with that.

830
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:52,079
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fantastic.

831
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:52,740
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be fun.

832
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,580
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the games have beat it.

833
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's awesome right there.

834
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it wasn't Rock Revolution because that would suck.

835
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:00,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Guitar Hero.

836
01:02:01,062 --> 01:02:02,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, I don't know.

837
01:02:03,779 --> 01:02:05,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And you rocked that Metallica edition.

838
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:09,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Got one more song for you guys before we start to get into the last segment of the show.

839
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:10,504
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're going to have Guitar Hero Metallica, unfortunately.

840
01:02:11,564 --> 01:02:26,534
[SPEAKER_06]: This news is actually coming to us from LiveJournal, of which our eyes and ears are sometimes on LiveJournal, but apparently there's a whole Beatmania 2DX community out there on LiveJournal, and there was a post that highlights that some of the clips from Beatmania 2DX Empress, you know, which is the new one in arcades, it's what, 16th?

841
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:28,555
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

842
01:02:52,954 --> 01:02:55,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, darn.

843
01:02:55,457 --> 01:02:59,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how he'll ever manage to get more clips up on the internet.

844
01:02:59,081 --> 01:03:01,944
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like there's other services out there where they can do that.

845
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:03,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, there are.

846
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think though that Konami would suddenly put the squelch on this?

847
01:03:10,025 --> 01:03:13,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not like 2DX is a huge thing here in America anyway.

848
01:03:13,648 --> 01:03:15,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have us stick up their ass, I don't know.

849
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:16,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they won't care.

850
01:03:17,571 --> 01:03:19,493
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of dumb because it doesn't really hurt anything.

851
01:03:19,513 --> 01:03:26,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see, you know, if anything, it's driving hype for it because everyone wants to see how hard these songs are and stuff like that.

852
01:03:27,779 --> 01:03:29,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see what the big deal is, but hey, you know what?

853
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:36,743
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in the right to be able to protect their property or whatever, but still, I think it's kind of stupid.

854
01:03:36,963 --> 01:03:47,268
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that can come good of this, of Konami taking this down, is that then I won't see them and get angry at them for not really trying to support Beatmania over here.

855
01:03:48,688 --> 01:03:52,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the only good thing that can come of it, because then I won't see them and get frustrated, even if

856
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:57,466
[SPEAKER_06]: The quality of those games, in my opinion, has gone down ever since Red.

857
01:03:58,086 --> 01:04:02,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you get to the 16th version of something, it can't really be that edgy anymore.

858
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:03,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tough.

859
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:09,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have to go back to something from the previous story, by the way.

860
01:04:09,234 --> 01:04:13,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Suss says that they should have Rock Band Weird Al edition.

861
01:04:14,795 --> 01:04:15,436
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

862
01:04:34,459 --> 01:04:37,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sadly enough totally off topic with this.

863
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:53,861
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason in my carb, I was switching up the music that I've been listening to, and it got me thinking there is actually a way I was thinking that they could bring back DDR and make it actually new and fresh and have the same appeal as it did before, but I know that they would never do it.

864
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:54,782
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

865
01:04:56,414 --> 01:05:02,464
[SPEAKER_07]: It would take too long to explain, but it's basically taking a different direction than they have it right now.

866
01:05:02,584 --> 01:05:09,336
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, kind of going back to the way it was and just, you know, making sure, like, keeping things...

867
01:05:11,235 --> 01:05:11,595
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

868
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:41,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

869
01:05:41,276 --> 01:05:43,458
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't dig enough into Loki's head.

870
01:05:43,558 --> 01:05:44,399
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of stuff in there.

871
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:45,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a spoon.

872
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:46,981
[SPEAKER_06]: We can try.

873
01:05:47,581 --> 01:05:50,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyhow, I don't know about you guys, but I get angsty when I think about all this news.

874
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:53,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the fact that we don't really have Beatmania here in the U.S.

875
01:05:53,646 --> 01:05:54,026
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.

876
01:05:54,386 --> 01:05:57,128
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that the one way I got to watch it is taken down off YouTube.

877
01:05:57,849 --> 01:06:00,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I get a little bit angsty and thus queues the FUs of the week.

878
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:25,370
[SPEAKER_03]: My biggest ever FU right now, because I have big ones all the time, goes to my finger.

879
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:30,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also goes to not being able to find my splint earlier.

880
01:06:30,922 --> 01:06:40,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a bad flare-up, and I've talked about it on the show before, but I had a flare-up of flexor tendonitis, which more commonly is known as trigger finger, in my right hand ring finger.

881
01:06:41,389 --> 01:06:45,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like for people to look this up, because it's really kind of gross.

882
01:06:47,013 --> 01:06:52,436
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's basically, it started to hurt a lot, and I have art finals due.

883
01:06:53,537 --> 01:06:55,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it hurts to type.

884
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:57,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurts to draw.

885
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurts to write.

886
01:06:59,161 --> 01:07:01,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurts to do almost anything that requires holding something.

887
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:02,884
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurts to hold a fork.

888
01:07:03,965 --> 01:07:06,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hold chopsticks pretty damn well, though, so that's good.

889
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:08,268
[SPEAKER_03]: That means I can go have sushi all the time.

890
01:07:08,928 --> 01:07:10,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I should use that as my excuse, you know?

891
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I can't hold a fork.

892
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:12,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I want sushi.

893
01:07:14,716 --> 01:07:15,637
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

894
01:07:15,977 --> 01:07:16,417
[SPEAKER_03]: But, no.

895
01:07:17,578 --> 01:07:20,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been kind of a major pain in the finger.

896
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:22,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So, F you to my hand.

897
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:29,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I've got to go see the orthopedist.

898
01:07:29,884 --> 01:07:31,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want surgery.

899
01:07:32,065 --> 01:07:36,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then that will put me behind on any of my physical drawing classes.

900
01:07:36,808 --> 01:07:37,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Surgery sucks.

901
01:07:38,569 --> 01:07:40,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know all about that.

902
01:07:41,643 --> 01:07:43,124
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the end of the world, though.

903
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no gallbladder.

904
01:07:44,124 --> 01:07:45,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Laparoscopic surgery is not so bad.

905
01:07:45,705 --> 01:07:47,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look, you know, I've been starting to eat some of this.

906
01:07:47,766 --> 01:07:49,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I had Jack in the Box the other day, okay?

907
01:07:49,646 --> 01:07:52,808
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not getting that for like six months and getting to eat it.

908
01:07:53,068 --> 01:07:53,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

909
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:58,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing also having to do with medical woes is the fact that every time I eat anything, it makes me sick.

910
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, small accomplishments in gallbladder world.

911
01:08:03,452 --> 01:08:04,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I had Mexican food yesterday.

912
01:08:05,093 --> 01:08:05,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had Mexican food.

913
01:08:05,733 --> 01:08:07,273
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not talking about like fucking Taco Bell.

914
01:08:07,293 --> 01:08:11,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about like Aldo Berritos where you get like pretty decent Mexican food.

915
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:12,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually ate that yesterday.

916
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:14,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Made with real lard?

917
01:08:14,312 --> 01:08:15,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm okay.

918
01:08:15,532 --> 01:08:16,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

919
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:16,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.

920
01:08:17,434 --> 01:08:22,397
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's been like randomly every time I eat something I get kind of lonely.

921
01:08:22,757 --> 01:08:23,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like when I had the plague.

922
01:08:24,938 --> 01:08:26,219
[SPEAKER_06]: See, we talked food after all.

923
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:27,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

924
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:30,501
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had Indian food today and I didn't care how sick I got.

925
01:08:31,342 --> 01:08:32,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

926
01:08:32,443 --> 01:08:34,404
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one thing we've got to do soon.

927
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,685
[SPEAKER_03]: We are so going back to Star of India.

928
01:08:36,805 --> 01:08:38,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Loki, do you have any FUs?

929
01:08:39,627 --> 01:08:39,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

930
01:08:40,396 --> 01:08:48,203
[SPEAKER_07]: SmallFU2 fries because they sold me a defective set of RAM.

931
01:08:48,363 --> 01:09:03,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to upgrade my computer from 2 to 4 gigs and the second pair of RAM chips I got apparently no worky because my computer crashes after like 2 minutes every time I launch it up now.

932
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to take those out, so that sucked.

933
01:09:06,441 --> 01:09:09,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And then FU to Kaiser for reasons I can't say.

934
01:09:10,323 --> 01:09:20,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And FU to my work for giving me way more accounts than I can handle and not giving me any more money.

935
01:09:20,487 --> 01:09:21,848
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I don't think they are.

936
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:24,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And that sucks because there's nothing I can do about it.

937
01:09:25,309 --> 01:09:28,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't FU'd your work for similar reasons.

938
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,581
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

939
01:09:57,352 --> 01:09:57,752
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

940
01:10:00,053 --> 01:10:02,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you I would be all over that if it paid more.

941
01:10:03,155 --> 01:10:05,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I'd be all over it too if it paid more.

942
01:10:06,257 --> 01:10:07,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep mine short.

943
01:10:07,177 --> 01:10:07,637
[SPEAKER_06]: My F.U.

944
01:10:07,677 --> 01:10:10,239
[SPEAKER_06]: is to the cold weather because it's cool.

945
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:14,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Beckers, you've been quiet tonight, but maybe you have a little angst in you.

946
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:15,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything you want to give a good F.U.

947
01:10:15,741 --> 01:10:16,682
[SPEAKER_06]: to, a good hearty F.U.

948
01:10:16,702 --> 01:10:16,802
[SPEAKER_06]: to?

949
01:10:20,638 --> 01:10:21,218
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

950
01:10:38,038 --> 01:10:38,338
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

951
01:10:39,599 --> 01:10:45,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we got one more segment before we open up the Skype lines for you guys at our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

952
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a favorite here on Orange Lounge Radio.

953
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,883
[SPEAKER_06]: One that I stole last week when DarkSakura wasn't here.

954
01:10:51,283 --> 01:10:51,503
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

955
01:10:51,523 --> 01:10:51,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I stole it.

956
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:52,884
[SPEAKER_06]: The classic game of the week.

957
01:10:53,204 --> 01:10:54,184
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a whore.

958
01:10:54,724 --> 01:10:56,105
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was a good game, though.

959
01:10:56,145 --> 01:10:58,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to give the Commodore 64 a little love last week, so it was good.

960
01:10:59,266 --> 01:11:01,827
[SPEAKER_06]: But now we get to go back to DarkSakura.

961
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:02,107
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

962
01:11:02,807 --> 01:11:03,107
Heart.

963
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:03,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

964
01:11:05,548 --> 01:11:06,929
[SPEAKER_06]: What's tonight's classic game of the week?

965
01:11:07,885 --> 01:11:08,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Metroid!

966
01:11:09,907 --> 01:11:11,689
[SPEAKER_06]: A very good choice it is tonight.

967
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:14,451
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good way for you to return to the program.

968
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:16,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to put the intro music up there first.

969
01:11:17,754 --> 01:11:19,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my favorite music in the game.

970
01:11:19,616 --> 01:11:22,558
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my favorite music in the damn game.

971
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to turn it up a little bit?

972
01:11:29,177 --> 01:11:30,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Brinstar music.

973
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:37,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Super Metroid is basically a... I mean, it plays... We know what the fuck Metroid is.

974
01:11:37,144 --> 01:11:41,849
[SPEAKER_03]: You run and you shoot shit and you're a girl in armor and you get weapons on the way.

975
01:11:44,727 --> 01:11:51,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, Samus returns back to the Metroid-y planet.

976
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:52,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Zebes, sorry.

977
01:11:53,570 --> 01:12:02,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically gets to explore around and kill things and find all of her old enemies and get some very new weapons.

978
01:12:02,874 --> 01:12:07,919
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you get the moonwalk, which means you can slide backwards while firing.

979
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,602
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, um, the ability to combine beams.

980
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:16,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, it has the save system that they put in Metroid 2, so that's pretty cool.

981
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:18,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

982
01:12:19,642 --> 01:12:25,984
[SPEAKER_03]: You also can go back into the gunship and save and recharge and do fun stuff there.

983
01:12:26,704 --> 01:12:30,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And all kinds of little secret areas you can get to by combining your weapons in different ways.

984
01:12:30,966 --> 01:12:32,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really fun.

985
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:42,770
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, you have to go back and find her baby Metroid.

986
01:12:44,301 --> 01:12:44,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

987
01:12:45,081 --> 01:12:45,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

988
01:12:45,702 --> 01:12:52,944
[SPEAKER_03]: In Metroid 2, she took home, there was a Metroid that hatched and believed Samus was its mommy.

989
01:12:53,985 --> 01:12:58,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she took it off to be studied to see if they can help people.

990
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:04,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And then someone stole the Metroid and she had to go back after her baby.

991
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:07,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Samus' jellyfish looking baby.

992
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:08,911
[SPEAKER_00]: The last Metroid is in captivity.

993
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:12,232
[SPEAKER_00]: The galaxy is at peace.

994
01:13:15,302 --> 01:13:18,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Digitized voice for Super Nintendo, hi!

995
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:22,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

996
01:13:22,974 --> 01:13:23,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Um.

997
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:35,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I did think it was funny that the Metroid producer was busy working on the Virtual Boy at the time and didn't have much involvement with this.

998
01:13:36,398 --> 01:13:45,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a game that I'll get Dan to play, and I'll just sit back on the couch going, go this way, go that way, go this way, go that way.

999
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:46,947
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really freaking cool.

1000
01:13:47,468 --> 01:13:48,469
[SPEAKER_03]: You're better at this than I am.

1001
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,121
[SPEAKER_06]: You know my thoughts on this game.

1002
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:55,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this game more than most other games.

1003
01:13:55,804 --> 01:13:56,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much any other game.

1004
01:13:57,105 --> 01:13:58,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this game so much.

1005
01:13:58,326 --> 01:14:03,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already been caught up in the controversy about how much I love this game.

1006
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:05,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't repeat it, but let's just say I love this game.

1007
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:08,332
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is electronic nookie.

1008
01:14:09,433 --> 01:14:11,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, what?

1009
01:14:11,696 --> 01:14:11,996
[SPEAKER_03]: It is!

1010
01:14:12,076 --> 01:14:13,998
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Sex and Pixels.

1011
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:14,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.

1012
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:15,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Without being dirty.

1013
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1014
01:14:17,401 --> 01:14:29,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we all know that this game has been the big influence for the current series of Castlevania games, you know, with that same type of map system running all over the place shooting stuff, except using a whip.

1015
01:14:30,474 --> 01:14:52,558
[SPEAKER_03]: um it also is one of it's actually stated um in my resource that it was a contributor to the speedrun phenomenon because you did actually if for beating the the game in different ways you got different rewards different things you can speedrun through super metroid like a mofo if you know where you're going and what you're doing

1016
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:57,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen this game beaten in person on a major speedrun.

1017
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was beautiful.

1018
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:04,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's really awesometastic.

1019
01:15:05,966 --> 01:15:06,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Metroid!

1020
01:15:06,786 --> 01:15:08,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Metroid Game of the Week.

1021
01:15:08,127 --> 01:15:11,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get it to the point where it plays the theme.

1022
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:14,530
I think it's just going to start the first level.

1023
01:15:14,571 --> 01:15:14,931
Here we go.

1024
01:15:14,991 --> 01:15:15,291
All right.

1025
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:27,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this game.

1026
01:15:28,614 --> 01:15:29,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I do love this game.

1027
01:15:29,414 --> 01:15:31,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play this game right now.

1028
01:15:31,055 --> 01:15:31,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck this show.

1029
01:15:31,775 --> 01:15:35,396
[SPEAKER_03]: The music in this game was freaking fantastic.

1030
01:15:35,796 --> 01:15:36,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It really was.

1031
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:46,680
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what the Nintendo sound processor was eventually what was incorporated, if I'm right, it's what led to the one in the PlayStation.

1032
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Sony made Nintendo's sound processor.

1033
01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:57,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I really just want to say, because we do have some younger folks that listen to this show who weren't a teenager or junior high or whatever when this game first came out.

1034
01:15:57,644 --> 01:15:59,405
[SPEAKER_06]: You really owe it to yourself to check out this game.

1035
01:15:59,545 --> 01:16:02,546
[SPEAKER_06]: This is gaming at some of its greatest.

1036
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:08,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And as much crap as I've given the whole Chrono Trigger versus Super Metroid thing that came up totally unnecessarily.

1037
01:16:09,008 --> 01:16:09,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1038
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:39,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, no one's going to care if it's a 2D game.

1039
01:16:39,913 --> 01:16:45,796
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's not going to buy your game just because, oh, it's 2D, I don't want to play a 2D game.

1040
01:16:46,357 --> 01:16:49,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what, people will play a 2D game and they will like it.

1041
01:16:50,279 --> 01:16:53,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at a game like Braid, you can still do awesome things in 2D.

1042
01:16:53,161 --> 01:17:02,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Castlevania games, they sell like hotcakes on the DS, and they would sell like hotcakes on the Wii if they put out a really cool looking 2D Castlevania game.

1043
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:03,587
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to go all 3D.

1044
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:05,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make it fun.

1045
01:17:05,808 --> 01:17:07,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it exciting.

1046
01:17:07,629 --> 01:17:08,889
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you have to do.

1047
01:17:09,669 --> 01:17:10,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1048
01:17:10,429 --> 01:17:11,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we are going to go... Hey, you know what?

1049
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:15,051
[SPEAKER_06]: That Metroid Zero game, even though it was on the Game Boy Advance, was pretty awesome.

1050
01:17:15,271 --> 01:17:19,512
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great successor, in a way, to Super Metroid, if that makes sense.

1051
01:17:19,572 --> 01:17:24,833
[SPEAKER_06]: And they revisited the original Metroid, but changed just enough that it really felt all new again, which I thought was kind of awesome.

1052
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:27,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

1053
01:17:27,114 --> 01:17:29,234
[SPEAKER_06]: It's open.

1054
01:17:29,254 --> 01:17:31,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just now seeing, though, that our time might have run out on it.

1055
01:17:32,904 --> 01:17:33,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoops!

1056
01:17:33,564 --> 01:17:33,985
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1057
01:17:35,926 --> 01:17:39,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious if the Skype line is going to work tonight or if I'm late.

1058
01:17:40,828 --> 01:17:42,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Today was the day it runs out.

1059
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:45,591
[SPEAKER_06]: So we may or may not be able to get calls tonight.

1060
01:17:45,611 --> 01:17:50,814
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR I'm going to try calling it myself real fast and see if it works.

1061
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:56,657
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Oh, we have a call.

1062
01:17:56,997 --> 01:17:58,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that call is coming in on Skype though.

1063
01:17:58,598 --> 01:18:00,219
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR

1064
01:18:01,048 --> 01:18:03,393
[SPEAKER_06]: O-L-R Let me see if it works.

1065
01:18:03,613 --> 01:18:04,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm calling it myself.

1066
01:18:06,739 --> 01:18:10,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I do this live on air test that's very professional?

1067
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:10,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1068
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:15,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick stuff, just confirming a lot of the rumors that we had from a couple weeks ago.

1069
01:18:15,946 --> 01:18:19,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Uncharted 2 Among Thieves was announced.

1070
01:18:19,467 --> 01:18:23,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that thing that supposedly leaked out from Sony saying that there was a new Uncharted game?

1071
01:18:24,129 --> 01:18:28,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently it's true, so I wonder if the rest of it will be true as well.

1072
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:37,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Another big game that we should have mentioned during this show, but Killzone 2 finally got a release date, February 27th.

1073
01:18:39,072 --> 01:18:50,941
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's ever going to be an epic first-person shooter game for the PS3, it definitely kills into their Gears of War, if you want to look at it that way.

1074
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:57,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of interesting, someone's bringing Catan to the PS3 as well.

1075
01:18:57,785 --> 01:18:59,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Republic is bringing out that game.

1076
01:18:59,286 --> 01:19:01,528
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually going to be a different version that was on the 360.

1077
01:19:01,688 --> 01:19:03,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of like this one better.

1078
01:19:05,251 --> 01:19:06,491
[SPEAKER_07]: No word on when that's going to be out, though.

1079
01:19:07,572 --> 01:19:08,373
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1080
01:19:30,413 --> 01:19:33,494
[SPEAKER_07]: and it will create objects for you based on what you write in.

1081
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:40,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So for example, you have to collect these stars throughout the game and you can write in ladder and a ladder will spawn.

1082
01:19:40,257 --> 01:19:47,620
[SPEAKER_07]: You can climb the ladder to get the star or you write in football and you can throw a football at the tree or beaver and the beaver will chew down the tree.

1083
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:55,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Well apparently there's such an enormous dictionary of words in this game you can literally put whatever you want.

1084
01:19:55,303 --> 01:19:55,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean just...

1085
01:19:57,315 --> 01:19:57,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1086
01:20:12,535 --> 01:20:23,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, I'd like to mention that apparently, according to YYR in chat, he is having a contest.

1087
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:24,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was going to read this.

1088
01:20:24,962 --> 01:20:25,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fine.

1089
01:20:25,543 --> 01:20:26,463
[SPEAKER_06]: You go ahead and read this.

1090
01:20:26,483 --> 01:20:26,923
[SPEAKER_06]: No, go ahead.

1091
01:20:26,983 --> 01:20:27,484
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1092
01:20:27,544 --> 01:20:28,144
[SPEAKER_06]: You stole my thought.

1093
01:20:28,184 --> 01:20:28,424
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1094
01:20:28,444 --> 01:20:28,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

1095
01:20:28,944 --> 01:20:29,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I will say this.

1096
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:32,126
[SPEAKER_06]: The contest actually doesn't start until Tuesday.

1097
01:20:32,146 --> 01:20:33,587
[SPEAKER_06]: We're giving you a sneak peek right here.

1098
01:20:33,607 --> 01:20:33,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Snake360 contest.

1099
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:50,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and you can win, there's $450 in prizes to be given away, and they have three different challenges, Race to Fanatic, Survivor Challenge, and Battle Video Exhibition, and of course, different prizes.

1100
01:20:51,122 --> 01:20:59,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like the prizes for each category include either a 4,000 points card or one year of live.

1101
01:21:01,209 --> 01:21:03,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of stuff being given away, so that's kind of cool.

1102
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:10,513
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently the contest starts on Tuesday, ends on Sunday, January 11th.

1103
01:21:11,193 --> 01:21:14,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can really say, and truthfully say, you heard it here first.

1104
01:21:14,615 --> 01:21:19,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Aaron, the author of the game, just put this up and sent us a message first.

1105
01:21:19,276 --> 01:21:21,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we had him on our show a couple weeks ago and he hasn't forgotten about us.

1106
01:21:22,797 --> 01:21:23,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome guy.

1107
01:21:24,118 --> 01:21:24,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1108
01:21:24,678 --> 01:21:30,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if we're automatically ineligible, but I'm thinking the battle video might actually be kind of fun to try.

1109
01:21:32,076 --> 01:21:32,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, um, no.

1110
01:21:59,212 --> 01:21:59,932
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1111
01:22:16,317 --> 01:22:17,038
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds pretty fun.

1112
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:18,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is pretty cool.

1113
01:22:18,599 --> 01:22:21,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, Gran Turismo 5 apparently is on track for holiday of the night.

1114
01:22:22,261 --> 01:22:27,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny, because I thought that was supposed to be out this year, but, you know, hey, I guess it's still on track to come out someday.

1115
01:22:27,605 --> 01:22:28,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Show us home.

1116
01:22:28,145 --> 01:22:28,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we got a call.

1117
01:22:28,885 --> 01:22:29,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1118
01:22:29,786 --> 01:22:30,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1119
01:22:30,747 --> 01:22:32,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.

1120
01:22:32,468 --> 01:22:34,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, I'm very special tonight, and...

1121
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:38,252
[SPEAKER_08]: The One Voice of the Crowd, or something like that.

1122
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:56,869
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1123
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:22,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1124
01:23:45,093 --> 01:24:00,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, when DJ Hero and all that stuff was kind of coming up, I was just kind of going around looking for information, and I pulled up a Kotaku post about it with the first notes on it, and the picture of it reminded me of a story that I don't believe I've told on here.

1125
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:13,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I get into that, I was just going to kind of ask, there's been a screenshot that makes DJ Hero look like Guitar Hero with a DJ floating next to the chart, but we don't really know anything about the game itself or the controller, do we?

1126
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:17,398
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some rumors about the controller a while back.

1127
01:24:17,438 --> 01:24:21,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't the controller supposed to be like a giant turntable with kind of like buttons around it or something like that?

1128
01:24:21,241 --> 01:24:26,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to remember there was a story a couple... Yeah, something like, it's not going to look like Beatmania.

1129
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:27,146
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.

1130
01:24:27,826 --> 01:24:31,629
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a common misconception about it is that, oh, well, they're going to rip off Beatmania.

1131
01:24:31,689 --> 01:24:35,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, it doesn't look like they really want to go for that exact same game.

1132
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:36,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be different, it looks like.

1133
01:24:37,034 --> 01:24:44,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitars and drums can't exactly be made original when they're supposed to be guitars and drums, but DJ decks have a lot of liberty to play with.

1134
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:44,820
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

1135
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:56,049
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Kotaku entry that I was talking about, you know that Joystick and Kotaku and everybody else picks a featured picture that my Mario Kart code has been so greatly featured on three years ago.

1136
01:24:58,751 --> 01:25:03,875
[SPEAKER_08]: They have this little actual DJ Pioneer deck that reminded me of something I saw at Best Buy.

1137
01:25:04,816 --> 01:25:07,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Best Buy opened up a musical instruments corner of the building.

1138
01:25:08,644 --> 01:25:12,845
[SPEAKER_08]: and when we were there the last time, we kind of poked our heads in there and were killing some time.

1139
01:25:13,245 --> 01:25:16,386
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a bunch of drum kits, digital drum kits laid out.

1140
01:25:16,746 --> 01:25:33,211
[SPEAKER_08]: They had drawers of DJ kits with full-size digital turntable decks, I guess, and little miniature turntable decks with the crossfader and the, if there's a specific name for the centerpiece, far be it for me to know what it's called.

1141
01:25:33,643 --> 01:25:34,163
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1142
01:25:53,689 --> 01:26:16,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of looking forward to seeing more with what comes about with DJ Hero I think we are all on pins and needles about DJ Hero, Jason But the sad thing is I don't think we're going to see it until E3 I think this is going to be Activision's big thing at E3 next year Because with Guitar Hero, we know that shit They say new Guitar Hero game, we're like whoopty shit, we know what this is all about But DJ Hero is going to be real new, you know what I mean?

1143
01:26:16,717 --> 01:26:17,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah

1144
01:26:18,491 --> 01:26:21,553
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can draw the parallels to everything you want that's already come out.

1145
01:26:21,893 --> 01:26:26,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Beatmania and Kraken DJ and I seem to remember there was something even more obscure that I can't think of.

1146
01:26:26,977 --> 01:26:33,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Kraken DJ was fun and all, but it just wasn't a real deck besides... Okay, it was.

1147
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:34,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Two turntables and a crossfader.

1148
01:26:35,444 --> 01:26:39,007
[SPEAKER_08]: But none of the effectors, none of the volumes, none of that.

1149
01:26:39,307 --> 01:26:44,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, remember this, Jason, like 98% of gamers haven't played any of those games you just mentioned, too.

1150
01:26:44,912 --> 01:26:47,534
[SPEAKER_06]: But DJ Hero really has the potential, you know, to kind of

1151
01:26:48,482 --> 01:26:50,185
[SPEAKER_06]: The foot is already in the door, so to speak.

1152
01:26:50,345 --> 01:26:52,027
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get shelf space right next to Guitar Hero.

1153
01:26:55,459 --> 01:26:56,259
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1154
01:27:20,209 --> 01:27:25,451
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, sometimes women will come in here and want to know, where's that guitar game for my husband who's been away?

1155
01:27:25,471 --> 01:27:26,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm thinking, like, wow.

1156
01:27:26,932 --> 01:27:36,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, that really just kind of put into perspective, like, it really has kind of crossed over now into, like, that guitar game that every family has to have, if that makes sense.

1157
01:27:36,915 --> 01:27:41,117
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because they picked music that people actually know and care about to some extent.

1158
01:27:41,177 --> 01:27:47,900
[SPEAKER_06]: But DJ Hero is going to have a huge foot in the door because of the mainstream success of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, really.

1159
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:48,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1160
01:27:49,745 --> 01:27:54,668
[SPEAKER_08]: and the fact that they're actually going for names like Tiesto and anybody else that they're going to sign and announce later on down the line.

1161
01:27:54,828 --> 01:27:58,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would have thunk it when we started this show a few years ago that music games would become so huge, huh?

1162
01:27:59,231 --> 01:28:02,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially after we moved away from just music games.

1163
01:28:02,873 --> 01:28:03,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what did it.

1164
01:28:06,055 --> 01:28:13,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember there was no new DDR for like years and years and literally two weeks after we said, we're going to move away from the music game things and talk about general gaming.

1165
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Supernova is coming out.

1166
01:28:15,381 --> 01:28:16,002
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back.

1167
01:28:17,323 --> 01:28:17,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Bastards.

1168
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:18,619
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1169
01:28:19,179 --> 01:28:19,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1170
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:21,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Konami exists to spite you.

1171
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:23,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami does exist to spite us sometimes.

1172
01:28:23,781 --> 01:28:25,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I really truly believe that.

1173
01:28:25,682 --> 01:28:34,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the most interesting part about all this is the Guitar Hero arcade cabinets that was talked about a few weeks back.

1174
01:28:34,385 --> 01:28:34,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1175
01:28:35,265 --> 01:28:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And just the fact that they can do, especially with the fact that Guitar Hero itself went world tour, and the fact that apparently Konami's working with Activision for the cabinets.

1176
01:28:43,688 --> 01:28:43,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1177
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:48,407
[SPEAKER_08]: If that didn't just signal Rock Revolution's death that we already knew was coming, what does?

1178
01:28:49,147 --> 01:28:54,908
[SPEAKER_08]: But just the fact that World Tour exists and DJ Hero was acquired by Activision.

1179
01:28:55,828 --> 01:29:02,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I say Freestyle Games was acquired by Activision, who was making DJ Hero.

1180
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:13,572
[SPEAKER_08]: The big linked performance games that we always wanted out of DDR, 2DX, Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and optionally Keyboard Mania, but that died pretty quick.

1181
01:29:14,684 --> 01:29:20,931
[SPEAKER_08]: can actually come stateside, stateside music, and possibly too a lot for arcades for all we know.

1182
01:29:21,431 --> 01:29:22,793
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be freaking expensive, though.

1183
01:29:22,973 --> 01:29:26,797
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I said this a long time ago on the show, and I truly believe it.

1184
01:29:26,957 --> 01:29:31,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Harmonix and these developers were willing to take the risk that Konami wasn't, and look where it got them.

1185
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:34,579
[SPEAKER_06]: and Konami should be kicking their own ass right now.

1186
01:29:34,599 --> 01:29:46,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they didn't have the, if there weren't patent laws and all that stuff so that they could essentially ride the coattails now of someone else's success from their idea, which is odd, there wouldn't be a lot going for them right now in the music game world.

1187
01:29:46,903 --> 01:29:53,126
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as we can hate on them for filing those lawsuits, the fact that they're working together for an arcade machine is kind of redeeming.

1188
01:29:54,186 --> 01:29:57,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to quickly say this comment, Jason, before we let you go, get your reaction to this.

1189
01:29:57,668 --> 01:29:58,768
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in chat says,

1190
01:29:59,367 --> 01:30:04,048
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to play your own version of DJ Hero, you can download a DJ mixing program on your PC and mix your own MP3s.

1191
01:30:04,949 --> 01:30:08,150
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's boring because that's not telling me how to do it.

1192
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:08,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1193
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:09,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't play without arrows on the screen.

1194
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:12,671
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no arrows to step on or whatever.

1195
01:30:13,411 --> 01:30:13,691
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1196
01:30:14,071 --> 01:30:15,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason, we've got to let you go to get a couple more calls.

1197
01:30:15,872 --> 01:30:16,672
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have a good one, buddy.

1198
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:17,592
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always good to hear from you.

1199
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:19,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Giant Dorkfest.

1200
01:30:19,193 --> 01:30:19,453
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1201
01:30:19,573 --> 01:30:20,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's this show.

1202
01:30:20,773 --> 01:30:21,373
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1203
01:30:21,534 --> 01:30:21,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Later, dude.

1204
01:30:22,454 --> 01:30:22,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Night, guys.

1205
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:26,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is our name on Skype.

1206
01:30:26,078 --> 01:30:30,106
[SPEAKER_06]: The 800 number is broke tonight because I don't know how to pay a bill on time, apparently.

1207
01:30:31,889 --> 01:30:32,871
[SPEAKER_06]: For shame.

1208
01:30:33,232 --> 01:30:35,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot it was expiring today.

1209
01:30:35,155 --> 01:30:36,197
[SPEAKER_06]: They sent their reminders.

1210
01:30:36,258 --> 01:30:36,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I got busy.

1211
01:30:39,471 --> 01:30:41,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really see any other calls coming through.

1212
01:30:42,293 --> 01:30:43,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we clear out our last minute stories?

1213
01:30:43,674 --> 01:30:44,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Ring, ring.

1214
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:44,614
[SPEAKER_03]: We're done?

1215
01:30:44,634 --> 01:30:44,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Ring, ring.

1216
01:30:44,994 --> 01:30:45,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty much.

1217
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:47,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Rob.

1218
01:30:47,156 --> 01:30:48,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you wanted to read mail.

1219
01:30:48,236 --> 01:30:48,997
[SPEAKER_06]: We never did mailbag.

1220
01:30:49,017 --> 01:30:50,258
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Jimmy.

1221
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to do the mailbag.

1222
01:30:51,618 --> 01:30:53,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, first you told me there was no mailbag.

1223
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:54,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're telling me there's a mailbag.

1224
01:30:55,041 --> 01:30:55,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think we'd have time.

1225
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:56,281
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1226
01:30:56,441 --> 01:30:57,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll do it.

1227
01:30:57,502 --> 01:30:59,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Since no one else is calling on Skype, we'll close Skype.

1228
01:31:00,144 --> 01:31:00,784
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for you guys.

1229
01:31:00,804 --> 01:31:01,805
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1230
01:31:02,105 --> 01:31:08,529
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to actually have theme music for the Skype thing, and we need to play Bananaphone.

1231
01:31:09,648 --> 01:31:10,208
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's funny?

1232
01:31:10,228 --> 01:31:11,749
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the fortune cookie message last week.

1233
01:31:11,949 --> 01:31:12,869
[SPEAKER_06]: When you weren't here, yes.

1234
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:15,170
[SPEAKER_06]: How funny.

1235
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:15,691
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1236
01:31:15,911 --> 01:31:18,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I thought Ranma was calling in to give a review on something.

1237
01:31:18,632 --> 01:31:19,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is he?

1238
01:31:19,712 --> 01:31:21,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because he's on the phone.

1239
01:31:22,273 --> 01:31:22,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

1240
01:31:22,834 --> 01:31:23,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Ranma.

1241
01:31:24,094 --> 01:31:24,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you.

1242
01:31:26,935 --> 01:31:27,816
[SPEAKER_06]: But we love the mailbag, too.

1243
01:31:27,836 --> 01:31:32,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag, orangelaunchradio.com, which apparently we are doing this segment tonight, although I only saw one email in there when I went in earlier.

1244
01:31:34,358 --> 01:31:35,159
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll send an email.

1245
01:31:36,314 --> 01:31:38,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, OLR buddies and friends.

1246
01:31:38,096 --> 01:31:40,017
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually titled Why Hello There, OLR.

1247
01:31:41,218 --> 01:31:44,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally joined the new millennium and got an Xbox 360.

1248
01:31:44,601 --> 01:31:52,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I've survived solely on DS and PSP for the longest time, and I have to say that it's nice to have a non-portable gaming system again for the first time in nearly three years.

1249
01:31:53,308 --> 01:31:56,411
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, I only have Guitar Hero 3 and Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

1250
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:59,933
[SPEAKER_03]: My band's names are Spock's Eyebrows and Doodly Ladies, respectively.

1251
01:32:00,894 --> 01:32:02,715
[SPEAKER_03]: but I hope to remedy this soon.

1252
01:32:02,855 --> 01:32:05,956
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some good Xbox 360 games that I should look into purchasing?

1253
01:32:06,557 --> 01:32:07,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Fable!

1254
01:32:09,318 --> 01:32:12,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Fable 2 is kind of evil but it is definitely entertaining.

1255
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:13,620
[SPEAKER_03]: You can beat up chickens.

1256
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:18,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Please go on Xbox Live Arcade and look at all the sex that's on there.

1257
01:32:18,522 --> 01:32:19,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Symphony of the Night!

1258
01:32:20,523 --> 01:32:24,345
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't already have that on PlayStation 1, definitely Symphony of the Night.

1259
01:32:24,785 --> 01:32:27,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Go look at how much sex is available for cheap on Xbox Live Arcade.

1260
01:32:27,806 --> 01:32:28,486
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where you need to go.

1261
01:32:31,548 --> 01:32:41,217
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, oh shoot, there's also, um, there's of course the Rock Band series and, um, um, Brain Fart.

1262
01:32:42,358 --> 01:32:43,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Brain Fart the game!

1263
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:44,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero?

1264
01:32:45,261 --> 01:32:46,602
[SPEAKER_03]: She already said she had them!

1265
01:32:47,768 --> 01:32:48,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

1266
01:32:48,389 --> 01:32:48,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1267
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So, moving forward.

1268
01:32:52,313 --> 01:32:56,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Since Jamie mentioned playing Order of Ecclesia, I figured I would quickly plug the review I did of that game.

1269
01:32:57,058 --> 01:32:57,959
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great!

1270
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And can be found on my blog at www.AvengersTower.com

1271
01:33:03,024 --> 01:33:05,547
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is great, or the review is great?

1272
01:33:05,567 --> 01:33:05,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Both.

1273
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:14,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Order of Ecclesia is definitely a very difficult game compared to earlier Castlevania games, but the difficulty of the game most certainly adds to the fun.

1274
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, OLR, take care of yourselves, and I'll quite possibly see you soon.

1275
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:20,622
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as next year, perhaps.

1276
01:33:20,903 --> 01:33:21,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Eyebrow waggle.

1277
01:33:22,244 --> 01:33:23,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, Marin.

1278
01:33:23,365 --> 01:33:25,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care of yourself and each other.

1279
01:33:25,526 --> 01:33:29,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick, and this kind of goes back to something we were talking about way earlier in the show.

1280
01:33:30,467 --> 01:33:35,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Kunimatata, that was on your release dates for coming out in the Asia regions.

1281
01:33:35,849 --> 01:33:41,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's already been out in the Asia regions, but this is the English slash Chinese version.

1282
01:33:41,331 --> 01:33:44,552
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could import this and play it in English.

1283
01:33:45,593 --> 01:33:46,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Thought about it.

1284
01:33:46,673 --> 01:33:46,973
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only $49.90.

1285
01:33:47,813 --> 01:33:49,854
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not bad.

1286
01:33:50,874 --> 01:33:52,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't run over the animals, though.

1287
01:33:52,075 --> 01:33:52,935
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a downside.

1288
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:56,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Dope.

1289
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: We have more.

1290
01:33:58,062 --> 01:33:59,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's hear more.

1291
01:33:59,823 --> 01:34:00,803
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them tricked me!

1292
01:34:01,383 --> 01:34:04,485
[SPEAKER_03]: It said love, love, love, love, love, and I thought it was about me, but it was spam.

1293
01:34:05,825 --> 01:34:06,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards.

1294
01:34:06,365 --> 01:34:07,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate those spammers.

1295
01:34:07,986 --> 01:34:09,207
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who you should have F'ed?

1296
01:34:09,427 --> 01:34:11,247
[SPEAKER_03]: The one who stole your magnet off your car.

1297
01:34:11,908 --> 01:34:13,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot about that.

1298
01:34:14,929 --> 01:34:19,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a rainbow all love is divine magnet on my car, and somebody stole it.

1299
01:34:22,007 --> 01:34:23,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's on the fridge right now.

1300
01:34:24,869 --> 01:34:25,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Pissed me off.

1301
01:34:25,689 --> 01:34:26,330
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so messed up.

1302
01:34:28,311 --> 01:34:28,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn thieves!

1303
01:34:29,713 --> 01:34:30,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards!

1304
01:34:30,753 --> 01:34:31,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't make a fist.

1305
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:32,575
[SPEAKER_03]: This sucks.

1306
01:34:33,696 --> 01:34:38,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is your Friendly Neighborhood Mexican Actdeft.

1307
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,923
[SPEAKER_03]: A few weeks ago I got Tales of Vesperia and it's a pretty good game.

1308
01:34:43,123 --> 01:34:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend it.

1309
01:34:43,823 --> 01:34:44,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I point out where we live?

1310
01:34:44,944 --> 01:34:46,786
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of Friendly Neighborhood Mexicans.

1311
01:34:47,026 --> 01:34:47,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, lots and lots.

1312
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to say.

1313
01:34:49,381 --> 01:34:52,484
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's an actual in-Mexico Mexican.

1314
01:34:52,665 --> 01:34:53,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fair enough.

1315
01:34:53,906 --> 01:34:55,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes him special.

1316
01:34:57,739 --> 01:34:58,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1317
01:35:24,417 --> 01:35:52,955
[SPEAKER_03]: with the most recent global economy crisis the Mexican peso has lost its gain to the US dollar but for gaming it has meant a good thing rather than bad when I bought Tales of Vesperia I bought it for 755 pesos which is the MSRP price for it down here now a dollar is worth 1350 pesos approximately so doing the math I solved the game and cost the equivalent of $55 US total that's a savings of $5 US without added sales tax

1318
01:35:53,895 --> 01:35:57,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I marveled myself on how this crisis has caused at least one good thing.

1319
01:35:57,776 --> 01:36:00,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Another example is Gears of War 2, which is a newer game.

1320
01:36:00,877 --> 01:36:05,258
[SPEAKER_03]: In the US, it costs $60, while in Mexico it costs around $6.50.

1321
01:36:06,058 --> 01:36:09,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, doing the math, the game's cost in Mexico is the equivalent of $47, approximately $13 in savings.

1322
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:16,222
[SPEAKER_03]: and there are other games that would cost less here than crossing the border.

1323
01:36:16,622 --> 01:36:33,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there are other games that still do cost more here than in the U.S., but like I said, it's because of store making up prices rather than giving us the real retail price, especially on PlayStation and Nintendo games since they don't have a real representation in Mexico or Latin America, unlike Microsoft, which does have it.

1324
01:36:34,494 --> 01:36:37,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, that's all for now.

1325
01:36:38,237 --> 01:36:39,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, that's all for now, OLR Crew.

1326
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:42,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of happy news in all this crisis stuff.

1327
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:42,940
[SPEAKER_03]: See ya.

1328
01:36:43,801 --> 01:36:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to Jamie who reads this email if there are any grammatical or spelling errors in it.

1329
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:48,311
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1330
01:36:50,014 --> 01:36:50,996
[SPEAKER_03]: You have better...

1331
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:56,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Grammar and spelling than most people in America do.

1332
01:36:57,193 --> 01:37:01,055
[SPEAKER_06]: When you consider the English is not this gentleman's first language, from what I understand.

1333
01:37:01,135 --> 01:37:03,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe he said before Spanish is the native language.

1334
01:37:03,477 --> 01:37:05,038
[SPEAKER_06]: You're my freaking hero today.

1335
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:06,238
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1336
01:37:06,258 --> 01:37:09,100
[SPEAKER_06]: A very rare commendation from DarkSakura.

1337
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,382
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get that very often in the mailbag, Saban.

1338
01:37:11,402 --> 01:37:11,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at you.

1339
01:37:12,262 --> 01:37:13,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Wear that badge with honor, my friend.

1340
01:37:14,484 --> 01:37:19,367
[SPEAKER_03]: We also got an email forwarded to us.

1341
01:37:20,205 --> 01:37:21,646
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1342
01:37:49,049 --> 01:37:56,051
[SPEAKER_03]: What might be your thoughts regarding you as the consumer using LittleBigPlanet as an advertising and self-promoting marketing tool?

1343
01:37:56,091 --> 01:37:59,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me give you the gist of the email because it is kind of long for air, but I did read it off air.

1344
01:37:59,992 --> 01:38:09,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, the emailer was wondering, he was listening to some other shows on All Games and this kind of crossed his mind and wanted to hear our take on it because I guess he's been pulling some different shows.

1345
01:38:09,875 --> 01:38:10,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1346
01:38:11,015 --> 01:38:12,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad I didn't put it on the forum then.

1347
01:38:12,456 --> 01:38:16,099
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's a good question.

1348
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:21,784
[SPEAKER_06]: LittleBigPlanet has this potential to be a new medium for all this marketing.

1349
01:38:23,546 --> 01:38:25,708
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the potential for it, or where do you see people using it?

1350
01:38:26,628 --> 01:38:29,991
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think people could be using LittleBigPlanet for with all the marketing?

1351
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And to me, I kind of think, in a way, it's a new...

1352
01:38:35,013 --> 01:38:37,435
[SPEAKER_06]: LittleBigPlanet, I kind of compare to a new website.

1353
01:38:37,975 --> 01:38:38,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?

1354
01:38:38,856 --> 01:38:41,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a YouTube or iTunes or something.

1355
01:38:41,938 --> 01:38:44,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess iTunes isn't really a website, but you know what I mean?

1356
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:49,863
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a way to sell your product on it, there will be people that want to do that.

1357
01:38:49,963 --> 01:38:52,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it is the quote-unquote American way after all.

1358
01:38:52,805 --> 01:38:53,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I-Tunes Podcasting

1359
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:21,355
[SPEAKER_06]: When we signed up to do podcasting, it was people like us in their garages, in their basements with microphones talking about shit they liked.

1360
01:39:22,756 --> 01:39:39,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's hugely commercialized, and we're having a hard time staying afloat amongst all these... I mean, we'll be here doing our thing for a long, long time, but we have a hard time getting recognized because you have all these commercial people out trying to tie it into their website, their TV shows, their...

1361
01:39:39,803 --> 01:39:44,772
[SPEAKER_06]: TV networks that have very little to do with gaming but they have video game podcasts anyways and so on.

1362
01:39:48,715 --> 01:39:49,475
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1363
01:40:12,307 --> 01:40:12,847
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1364
01:40:30,777 --> 01:40:31,377
[SPEAKER_06]: True story.

1365
01:40:31,697 --> 01:40:36,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing Warcraft the other night, and there was a shout in one of the villages.

1366
01:40:36,119 --> 01:40:36,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even kidding.

1367
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:40,880
[SPEAKER_06]: If you live in, like, I think it was Boston.

1368
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:46,202
[SPEAKER_06]: If you live in Boston, come check out this show on Saturday night if you like this metal band.

1369
01:40:46,382 --> 01:40:52,524
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, dude, how many people in this world of Warcraft might live in Boston?

1370
01:40:52,564 --> 01:40:55,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Boston's a pretty big place.

1371
01:40:55,144 --> 01:40:58,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a big place, but World of Warcraft is a really fucking big place.

1372
01:40:58,966 --> 01:40:59,466
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like 100 Bostons.

1373
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:01,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Nintendo.

1374
01:41:24,617 --> 01:41:25,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Very true, very true.

1375
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even think about that, but you're right.

1376
01:41:27,922 --> 01:41:30,586
[SPEAKER_06]: People have been using video games to promote their shit for a long time.

1377
01:41:30,866 --> 01:41:39,158
[SPEAKER_03]: But we could actually have all of our villagers say OrangeSoundsRadio.com and then when they move to other people's villages, they'll spread.

1378
01:41:40,203 --> 01:41:40,603
[SPEAKER_06]: LittleBigPlanet

1379
01:42:10,363 --> 01:42:13,806
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and granted, I don't think he put a lot of effort into the level.

1380
01:42:13,826 --> 01:42:18,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he was more, it was his way of exploring the game and being able to give the game a good review.

1381
01:42:18,129 --> 01:42:21,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he ever kind of intended it to be like, you know, the one and only thing he ever does.

1382
01:42:22,032 --> 01:42:31,339
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, he invested a fair amount of time into it, but he kind of did like a real easy-ish type of level that kind of slyly worked in a plug for his show.

1383
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as long as you're not crazy about it, I bet they wouldn't.

1384
01:42:35,322 --> 01:42:39,385
[SPEAKER_07]: They were actually promoting a LittleBigPlanet fan community on there, and it got pulled.

1385
01:42:40,445 --> 01:42:41,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's so weird.

1386
01:42:42,006 --> 01:42:43,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is stupid.

1387
01:42:43,407 --> 01:42:45,069
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting a little stupid with that stuff.

1388
01:42:46,850 --> 01:42:47,931
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you laughing at over there?

1389
01:42:48,391 --> 01:42:52,534
[SPEAKER_03]: A picture that I got sent for the cover of Wolverine in Power Pack.

1390
01:42:53,495 --> 01:42:58,519
[SPEAKER_06]: To go back to the email, definitely where there's a way to do it, people are going to do it.

1391
01:42:59,579 --> 01:42:59,699
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

1392
01:43:02,569 --> 01:43:09,531
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a matter of time, but it's kind of interesting to see the moderation and how that's going to play into it because it was very hard to moderate Animal Crossing.

1393
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:13,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at the N-word snuck through on one of those cartridges.

1394
01:43:14,692 --> 01:43:19,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, I guess that's it for our show then.

1395
01:43:19,214 --> 01:43:20,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the last email too?

1396
01:43:20,894 --> 01:43:22,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It was indeed, Rob.

1397
01:43:22,275 --> 01:43:22,575
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1398
01:43:23,235 --> 01:43:26,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Last email tonight, and if you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1399
01:43:27,611 --> 01:43:28,071
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

1400
01:43:28,151 --> 01:43:29,191
[SPEAKER_06]: We're ready to get out of here.

1401
01:43:29,251 --> 01:43:31,472
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the final thoughts tonight.

1402
01:43:31,952 --> 01:43:32,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1403
01:43:32,813 --> 01:43:33,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1404
01:43:33,193 --> 01:43:34,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind, because it comes after.

1405
01:43:34,533 --> 01:43:35,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1406
01:43:36,013 --> 01:43:37,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

1407
01:43:37,954 --> 01:43:46,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at this actual P90 tactical load-bearing vest, which is kind of neat, because that would work with my airsoft gun, even though it's meant for actual real guns.

1408
01:43:47,717 --> 01:43:48,017
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1409
01:43:48,437 --> 01:43:49,777
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakra, your final thought.

1410
01:43:50,118 --> 01:43:51,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Deadpool's fucking funny.

1411
01:43:53,011 --> 01:43:54,913
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I'm fucking funny.

1412
01:43:56,134 --> 01:43:57,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Beckers, shut up.

1413
01:43:57,555 --> 01:43:59,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Beckers, thanks for joining us tonight.

1414
01:43:59,076 --> 01:44:03,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you didn't get to talk a whole lot, but I'm glad you and Jamie got to sit there in the corner and giggle like girls.

1415
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:03,660
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

1416
01:44:04,081 --> 01:44:07,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any final words for our listeners tonight?

1417
01:44:07,524 --> 01:44:08,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's freaking cold here.

1418
01:44:08,965 --> 01:44:09,585
[SPEAKER_06]: It is cold here.

1419
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:10,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1420
01:44:11,627 --> 01:44:13,208
[SPEAKER_06]: You should see what it's like in the summertime, though.

1421
01:44:13,248 --> 01:44:14,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, this is better than The Alternative.

1422
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:20,935
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have Becky on when we have stupid parent stories.

1423
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:22,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh boy.

1424
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:25,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we definitely need to hear from someone.

1425
01:44:25,572 --> 01:44:27,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thank you for reminding me.

1426
01:44:27,173 --> 01:44:29,354
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't even mention that story.

1427
01:44:29,554 --> 01:44:30,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh oh, what?

1428
01:44:31,275 --> 01:44:32,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, hold on, hold on.

1429
01:44:32,776 --> 01:44:33,737
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good, this is good.

1430
01:44:35,198 --> 01:44:44,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it was another game that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed, or another crime that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed for, and it had nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto at all.

1431
01:44:45,085 --> 01:44:48,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it had to do with, uh,

1432
01:44:49,144 --> 01:44:51,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Children torturing animals.

1433
01:44:53,687 --> 01:44:54,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's right.

1434
01:44:55,168 --> 01:45:07,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, the newest crime to get blamed, or Grand Theft Auto can get blamed for, is hanging kittens with game controller cords after playing Grand Theft Auto.

1435
01:45:08,416 --> 01:45:09,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently...

1436
01:45:11,607 --> 01:45:19,849
[SPEAKER_07]: A pair of unsupervised boys, six and seven years old, stoned a kitten and then strung it up following a Grand Theft Auto session.

1437
01:45:20,269 --> 01:45:23,010
[SPEAKER_06]: They reportedly used the controller cable in lieu of a rope.

1438
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:25,951
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're not talking about blowing the bong smoke in the kitty's face.

1439
01:45:26,151 --> 01:45:26,711
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

1440
01:45:27,091 --> 01:45:28,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, that's terrible.

1441
01:45:28,991 --> 01:45:32,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently this happened in late October in Mesa, Arizona.

1442
01:45:33,172 --> 01:45:39,314
[SPEAKER_07]: And it says the investigation began when deputies went to the neighborhood of one of the two boys.

1443
01:45:39,714 --> 01:45:41,896
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm thinking this goes a little bit beyond video games.

1444
01:45:41,916 --> 01:45:44,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking these kids are just really, really, really, really, really fucked up.

1445
01:45:44,258 --> 01:45:46,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, but the county sheriff actually said... So one question...

1446
01:46:07,177 --> 01:46:11,940
[SPEAKER_07]: or Arpaio.

1447
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:15,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it's the boy's parents or something.

1448
01:46:16,102 --> 01:46:19,504
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, this game allows players to kill cops and rape women.

1449
01:46:20,064 --> 01:46:24,167
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little wonder why they perpetrated such violence against a little animal.

1450
01:46:26,148 --> 01:46:28,189
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR in our chat, it says, the parents are to blame.

1451
01:46:28,209 --> 01:46:29,450
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have bought wireless controllers.

1452
01:46:32,910 --> 01:46:33,490
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

1453
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:35,451
[SPEAKER_07]: They would have stoned it to death anyways.

1454
01:46:35,511 --> 01:46:36,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Beckers is dying to say something.

1455
01:46:37,312 --> 01:46:39,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Institutionalize your children.

1456
01:46:39,833 --> 01:46:42,835
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to grow up to be serial killers.

1457
01:46:42,935 --> 01:46:45,496
[SPEAKER_04]: It has nothing to do with the video games.

1458
01:46:48,537 --> 01:46:49,758
[SPEAKER_06]: This is coming from a mom.

1459
01:46:49,818 --> 01:46:51,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Parents, this has nothing to do with video games.

1460
01:46:52,019 --> 01:46:53,379
[SPEAKER_06]: This has everything to do with you.

1461
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Your genes did this.

1462
01:46:56,721 --> 01:46:58,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop passing them on.

1463
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:08,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Your Hellspawn, Damian Light, did this.

1464
01:47:10,098 --> 01:47:10,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Becky.

1465
01:47:11,099 --> 01:47:11,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Padded room.

1466
01:47:13,261 --> 01:47:14,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just give them a hammer and leave them in a room by themselves.

1467
01:47:15,022 --> 01:47:15,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Now can we end the show?

1468
01:47:16,163 --> 01:47:16,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we end the show now?

1469
01:47:17,485 --> 01:47:17,745
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1470
01:47:17,845 --> 01:47:20,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for ending the show on dead kittens, you ass.

1471
01:47:21,248 --> 01:47:23,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I gotta go home and hug my kitty.

1472
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:24,931
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1473
01:47:26,195 --> 01:47:29,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one thing that will make it all better.

1474
01:47:30,381 --> 01:47:30,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies.

1475
01:47:31,443 --> 01:47:32,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, cookies.

1476
01:47:32,745 --> 01:47:34,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that note, we're going to go eat some cookies and end the show.

1477
01:47:35,088 --> 01:47:35,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

1478
01:47:36,269 --> 01:47:45,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and by the way, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, please tell two people you know about the program and help us spread the word, because as I mentioned earlier, it's really hard to stay afloat amongst all the commercialized and corporate shows out there.

1479
01:47:46,254 --> 01:47:55,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Word of mouth, it rocks, and you rock when you leave us happy reviews, and join us for live shows on All Games Radio Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, but if you can't, hey, listen to our recorded shows too.

1480
01:47:55,799 --> 01:47:59,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Send us an email sometime, because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

1481
01:47:59,781 --> 01:48:00,341
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next week.

1482
01:48:00,822 --> 01:48:03,503
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1483
01:48:04,003 --> 01:48:04,624
[SPEAKER_01]: www.allgames.com
