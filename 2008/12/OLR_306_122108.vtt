Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Moloto

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, December 21st, 2008, many game companies lay off their employees this holiday season.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
LittleBigPlanet gets some big updates, and has a recent Xbox Live Arcade game been ported to the 8-bit Nintendo?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Happy Holidays, y'all. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Santa, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
What?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
DarkSakura, of course. How you doing?

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
I am. I'm doing, um, crampy.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Ho, ho, ho.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Bop fucking hump.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Try having cramps around Christmas, you'll curse your uterus.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Did Santa bring you cramps for Christmas?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
That and a migraine.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Maybe you were a bad girl.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Fuck, I was. I'd rather have coal, because then I could light it on fire and be warm.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Say hello as well to the one and only, Techmaster Loki.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Hello.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
One of Santa's elves. Joining us to North Pole.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yes.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
That's correct.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Highly accurate.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
How are you this week?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm doing fine.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Anything exciting planned for the holidays?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Um, yes.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
All right, then. Can you tell us about it?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Well, I will in just a minute.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh, well, okay then.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, you should already know what it is, but, like, there's lots of stuff leading up to that.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Well, sometimes I play stupid for the sake of the listeners.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
It gets you to retell the story, even though you might have already told me.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Sometimes I don't know when you're pretending.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Radio magic. Radio magic.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
There's commentary in the chat room, Rob, about you saying y'all.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com. Do they not like the y'all? Am I not allowed to say that because I'm from NorCal?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
You didn't say it right.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh, what was I supposed to say?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Y'all.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Y'all.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Or, depending on certain parts, Ewins.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Ewins?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yep.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
All right.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
And Jayrod in chat wants to point out, my girlfriend also has cramps. Coincidence or evil plot?

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
We're here to make your Christmas suffer, you know, a little bit.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Could it be a conspiracy? Are all the gamer chicks on one big cycle? That's what I want to know.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
And only unless we've all been hanging out in the same room for at least two months.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Did you know, Rob, here's your unwanted education.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh, lordy.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
That if you get women living in the same place for long enough, their cycles will align.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
No, I've heard it. That's why I was making the joke.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
That all the gaming girls, you know, somehow via Xbox Live, I don't know, have all gotten on the same cycle.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Man, I'm a suck in college.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, actually, because-

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Like, everybody hide, it's the two-

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
No, it was actually true for my dorm.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I could bet.

03:01.000 --> 03:10.000
Because I had a suite. So me, my roommate, and our suite mate were all like, chocolate wine, now.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Of course, we were poor, so it was, you know, Strawberry Hill or Apple Wine.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Mad Dog?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
We at least had the taste to get the tasty Boon's Farm stuff.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Nice.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
And Everclear.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Alright.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Because it was Alabama, and you could get Everclear.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Alright.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
Anyhow, look, we're going to get into How Was Your Gaming Week, because we always start off the show.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Not How Was Your Vagina, but How Was Your Gaming Week, Dark Sakura.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
How Was Your Vag- Gaming Week.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I played Vagina Wars.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
No kidding.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Um, what?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Nothing.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
Um, I actually turned on my DS and then turned it right off when I got a phone call and forgot to play again.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
I played some Ragnarok, because I'm still playing.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Ooh.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
And I've decided that I might actually go back to World of Warcraft for just a little bit, just to see what the new expansion's like.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
But I really don't think I'll stick with it.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
It's more of a, huh, why not, while I'm waiting for the Star Trek MMO.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm going to warn you, if you're not at least level 55 in World of Warcraft, you won't see anything in the new expansion.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It's all endgame content and a new class.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
That's it.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So, sadly, there won't be a lot there for you.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I want to play a Draenei.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Draenei's are fun.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
And name her, um, I don't know, I had a name I was going to name her, but I forgot.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Because the Draenei women talk like Natasha from Rocky and Bewinkle.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Boris, look, he's moose and squirrel.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
He's fearless leader, darling.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I guess that would suit.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
But, um, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
What?

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
I, um, I am going to, in the next week, download Shoei Nikki.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, I know what else it was.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
I actually sat and watched a playthrough of Abadox.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And how was that?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Just as shitty as I remember.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
God, that game's hella old isn't it?

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
It's old and hard, and I love that game, but it is kind of a crap game.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.400
Cuz it's like that's from Gradius huh, that's from life force hmm. That's from Gradius hmm. That's from life force

05:13.840 --> 05:16.880
The one unique thing about it was the down scrolling levels

05:17.400 --> 05:21.280
That was kind of as opposed to up scrolling from life force exactly there you go

05:22.240 --> 05:24.240
Loki how was your gaming week?

05:24.400 --> 05:28.000
I played more Grand Theft Auto on PC

05:28.680 --> 05:30.680
and

05:31.600 --> 05:36.960
I've actually started tweaking some stuff now because they've made it a little bit easier for you to actually edit stuff in the game

05:36.960 --> 05:40.960
You just kind of have to know what you're doing. It's a little bit like the cheat device was on

05:41.680 --> 05:44.640
The Grand Theft Auto's on PSP similar type of stuff

05:44.640 --> 05:50.520
You know you have a file that you edit some of the amounts with actually it's a lot easier on the PC version because everything's

05:50.520 --> 05:52.520
labeled for you, so I made a

05:53.120 --> 05:57.240
Pistol that would catch a cop car and fire in one shot, and that was funny

05:58.640 --> 06:03.920
But just some of that stuff then the game crashed because I shot too many cars and caught him on fire

06:03.920 --> 06:06.520
Apparently didn't like that much fire at one time

06:08.560 --> 06:11.160
But it's kind of like finding a balance you know between

06:12.520 --> 06:16.760
Crazy shit and between fuego and non yeah well see my next thing

06:16.760 --> 06:24.160
I want to do is because you can make your gunfire have so much kickback to it like if you shoot somebody

06:24.160 --> 06:29.640
It'll knock them over or you can make them like fly away and that type of stuff, so I want to do that

06:29.640 --> 06:36.440
But I also want to have the trainer where I have infinite health so I can basically you know catapult myself with rockets

06:36.560 --> 06:39.540
You know across the map that might be fun, so

06:40.600 --> 06:45.400
You know eventually I'll do that, but there aren't that many mods out there for right now. There's like a drifting mod

06:46.280 --> 06:50.720
a mod that changes the car names to I guess realistic cars and then

06:51.720 --> 06:56.280
You know the rocket pistol thing which I was trying to do that myself and the first time it

06:56.280 --> 07:00.000
Glitched it out where I actually couldn't select that pistol anymore

07:00.000 --> 07:05.920
But then I figured out what I was doing wrong, and I don't know it's just not quite to where I need it to be yet

07:06.320 --> 07:11.080
But soon it will be and then of course you know more Grand Theft Auto 4

07:11.680 --> 07:13.360
multiplayer at work

07:13.360 --> 07:15.360
and that's still fun and

07:17.160 --> 07:19.840
Other than Grand Theft Auto I've been playing

07:20.640 --> 07:24.720
Dissida the new Final Fantasy fighting game and it's

07:24.720 --> 07:26.720
awesome

07:27.680 --> 07:31.040
You know it's kind of really cool because it's one of those games like you purchase it

07:31.040 --> 07:34.040
And then they have the prologue video, and it's like

07:34.760 --> 07:39.440
Listen, I know you're a fan of Final Fantasy, and I want to assure you that this was an excellent choice

07:39.440 --> 07:45.360
And then they kick your ass with a really awesome intro video, and then the game itself is pretty fun

07:45.520 --> 07:50.560
It's a little hard for me to play because I don't understand Japanese so the game rapes you, but consensually

07:50.560 --> 07:58.080
In a gentle way that you appreciate it. It's gentle rape. All right. It's just like it's like oh my god

07:58.080 --> 08:00.560
This is awesome. That can't be rape if you're willing

08:01.520 --> 08:04.840
So just say that's like a roleplay thing. Maybe it's a bit of a

08:06.160 --> 08:13.040
Sadism I see it would be like a hot chick all of a sudden getting naked and thrusting herself upon you

08:13.320 --> 08:17.800
But like see you're at first you're kind of like whoa what's going on here, but then you just go with it

08:17.800 --> 08:22.240
So yeah, it's I wouldn't know I haven't had that happen

08:23.000 --> 08:30.840
But no, it's it's really really awesome. It really kind of disappoints me though that they haven't brought. I wish they would make this I

08:32.680 --> 08:38.720
Put it on like the ps3 or something like that and then also expand upon it because you know this is as basically fighting

08:39.040 --> 08:41.720
That's all it is they have a little bit of cutscenes and stuff like that

08:41.760 --> 08:45.240
But there's no actual like you know role-playing running around that kind of stuff

08:45.240 --> 08:51.080
But they kept the fighting system in here and like say did a Kingdom Hearts type of thing where you have all the different characters

08:51.080 --> 08:52.440
from the different games

08:52.440 --> 08:57.080
They could really have a kick-ass game on their hands, but you know this is that itself is gonna be really awesome

08:57.080 --> 09:02.680
So DJ Dark Knight in chat at chat.org.com jokes. This is a aka or guys, too

09:02.800 --> 09:09.240
No, it's not even close to urgots. No way. That's not it's not even

09:09.840 --> 09:11.400
remotely close

09:11.400 --> 09:16.440
But boy does it have a funky name just like you know square likes to really give their game some funky names

09:16.440 --> 09:19.920
It does, but it's awesome. It really is awesome

09:19.920 --> 09:24.680
I got the fight garland that was really cool, and it has it broken up by each game

09:24.680 --> 09:30.200
So like I'm starting off with Final Fantasy 1 and so I'm playing the warrior of light

09:30.200 --> 09:33.880
I guess or something and then I fought garland for the first level there and

09:34.880 --> 09:36.880
Is the Warriors name AAA?

09:36.880 --> 09:43.800
No, they has no name. It's just the warrior of light or poop. It's my cartridge. No. It's not poop

09:45.520 --> 09:46.320
But it's cool

09:46.320 --> 09:51.000
Look as you level up the characters they level up and all the other levels that they appear in as well

09:51.000 --> 09:57.760
So I think I did have a party in Final Fantasy because I'm this mature. I think it was ass assy, but and poop I

09:59.680 --> 10:02.440
Think the last time when we played it on because I have the

10:02.440 --> 10:10.840
The WonderSwan one in Japanese. I actually sat down and tried to figure out the names to put in it in

10:11.920 --> 10:14.200
Katakana, so we had Dan, Jamie

10:14.920 --> 10:19.640
Dan made Eric for some reason one of his buddies who's kind of not all that all that bright

10:19.640 --> 10:22.280
And I don't remember who we named the last one

10:23.840 --> 10:28.640
My Chrono Trigger cartridge actually still has my friend save on it. It has me and there's Luca

10:28.640 --> 10:32.240
But seriously though like, you know, not to interrupt or anything

10:32.760 --> 10:36.200
This game could be like Kingdom Hearts, but without

10:36.800 --> 10:38.480
You know the Disney characters

10:38.480 --> 10:41.080
I mean if they for whatever reason lost the Disney license

10:41.080 --> 10:47.600
They could easily do something like that with these characters and just some massive scale and it would be so much awesome

10:47.960 --> 10:49.840
I want to point these

10:49.840 --> 10:55.320
Observations out in the chat room shower and says did garland say I garland shall knock you out all down

10:55.320 --> 10:59.840
And that was said at the exact same time as game grew asking to garland knock you all down

10:59.840 --> 11:04.160
I don't know. It's in Japanese, so I can't read that but maybe he did in

11:04.720 --> 11:06.720
Japanese I don't know

11:07.920 --> 11:09.920
Alrighty then anything else you've been playing this week

11:12.080 --> 11:17.480
Animal crossing played a little more animal crossing. I don't know why I'm still playing animal cross

11:17.480 --> 11:21.320
I need to come visit Nellie's village. I know well the thing is I tried

11:21.320 --> 11:23.080
you

11:23.080 --> 11:28.880
Know I don't understand this you apparently you have to talk to some idiot in the town to get a friend code

11:29.520 --> 11:31.520
What the fuck the guy at the gate?

11:32.280 --> 11:34.760
All the last versions, too, okay, that's great

11:34.760 --> 11:38.280
But why the hell do I have to talk to somebody you have a friend codes assigned to the game?

11:38.280 --> 11:40.720
It's stupid that way it connects to Nintendo Wi-Fi

11:41.760 --> 11:44.520
The first time I can extend it also is different per player

11:45.320 --> 11:48.700
Yeah, yeah, and so yeah what you want you get it from Nintendo Wi-Fi

11:48.700 --> 11:51.720
Then you can access it whenever in the game, so you just have to do it that one time

11:51.720 --> 11:55.260
I'm fine, so I have to do that, but yeah, I haven't gone around to that yet. I

11:55.900 --> 11:58.920
Will them awesome all right well then my gaming week

11:58.920 --> 12:00.880
I played a little bit of Animal Crossing, but not a lot

12:00.880 --> 12:03.760
I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff honestly it was a lot of the same stuff

12:03.760 --> 12:05.760
I've talked about in previous weeks Prince of Persia

12:05.920 --> 12:07.440
World of Warcraft

12:07.440 --> 12:10.920
And the only new game I really checked out this week was a dash

12:10.920 --> 12:16.640
What's so damn funny over there dark Sakura? I hear her giggling. I was looking at uncyclopedia about lavas

12:16.640 --> 12:21.160
This is full name lavas big-ass porcupine from hell Thompson Smith

12:23.520 --> 12:28.720
Uncyclopedia is so string is also a picture of one of the little aliens bursting out of someone's stomach

12:29.040 --> 12:34.540
Is this picture taken by hospital staff one minute after lavas was born cute little scamp wasn't he I?

12:35.000 --> 12:41.120
Think somebody in chats that made a lavas joke something about oh Dan shadow says you think that's fun try playing chrono trigger and name

12:41.120 --> 12:43.120
everyone lavas

12:43.120 --> 12:47.680
And I don't know what that's supposed to do all right anyway um the only new game

12:47.680 --> 12:53.160
I played this week was the free game. I love free games, and there was a free game to hit Xbox live this week

12:53.160 --> 12:56.360
I don't know if y'all remember, but it's Doritos dash of destruction

12:56.440 --> 13:02.320
Which was I think it was like I think it's an XNA game that somebody made or it was like concept forget one some type

13:02.320 --> 13:04.120
Of contest. I don't know if it was next

13:04.120 --> 13:08.620
I read it was a like try to come up with a concept for a game, and then they made a Doritos game

13:08.620 --> 13:16.620
Yeah, which which actually kind of worked out because it does it doesn't like overdo it with the Doritos like doesn't beat the Doritos

13:16.620 --> 13:20.900
Thing into you like you know obviously it's there, and there's definitely the product placement

13:20.900 --> 13:26.680
But the game is so random like it otherwise really has nothing to do with tortilla chips or whatever you want to call Doritos

13:27.180 --> 13:32.600
They you basically you can play as a truck or you drive around the town trying to deliver Doritos

13:32.600 --> 13:38.020
But you know whatever it could be anything and or you can play a t-rex and chase said trucks

13:38.020 --> 13:40.020
So it's kind of an interesting little cat-and-mouse

13:40.540 --> 13:44.340
Concept and I gotta say you know it's better than yours as far as free games

13:44.340 --> 13:46.460
Go is this something I would have paid money for

13:47.980 --> 13:49.980
Probably not maybe

13:50.180 --> 13:51.780
$5 maybe

13:51.780 --> 13:58.040
But you know it's a cute little cat-and-mouse thing going on where you can you know play the truck trying to deliveries or you?

13:58.040 --> 14:01.660
Can go and out try to eat the trucks, and you know that made it kind of fun

14:02.180 --> 14:05.300
But I don't think it's anything it's gonna have like a lasting value to it

14:05.300 --> 14:08.220
You know a lot of the levels kind of look the same plus you just would

14:08.420 --> 14:11.260
Unexplainably get these power-ups that didn't seem to do a whole lot of anything

14:11.740 --> 14:16.260
And the game it was handing out achievements like candy like it was really one of those games

14:16.260 --> 14:19.580
It was like push start you got an achievement for pushing start

14:19.580 --> 14:23.540
You know like that's how it kind of felt to me, but you know I'm sure the achievement whores will enjoy that

14:24.620 --> 14:28.340
But it was you know again for free. It's really hard to complain

14:28.340 --> 14:33.660
It is probably actually you know considering the free games. I can think of on Xbox live. We had what Yaris we had

14:33.660 --> 14:34.860
a

14:34.860 --> 14:39.620
Totem ball we had the shooter game Aegis wing that was that was pretty cool, too

14:39.620 --> 14:43.580
I put this on about the same level so it's it's a it's a decent free game

14:43.580 --> 14:48.380
Because considering it was product placement and my expectations were very very low

14:49.540 --> 14:53.940
There's also it wasn't bad this hold them. Oh, yeah, Texas hold them was free for a little while

14:53.940 --> 14:57.260
Yeah, that's true, but now it's not so that was more of a limited time for you

14:57.260 --> 15:01.260
Yeah, you know what else is not free hmm apparently if you delete your copy of

15:01.260 --> 15:07.620
Hexic HD mm-hmm you have to pay $10 to get it back really yeah, I didn't know that

15:07.620 --> 15:09.500
I actually transferred hard drives this week

15:09.500 --> 15:11.300
I finally got 120 gig hard drive

15:11.300 --> 15:17.060
And did the transfer and it kind of freaked me out because when I did the transfer it said some files were corrupt and could

15:17.060 --> 15:22.180
Not be transferred. I'm like shit. What did I lose? I haven't figured out what I've lost yet, so your marbles

15:22.820 --> 15:28.460
Well besides that I mean like what on the Xbox 360 day. I lose. I hope it wasn't any of the rock band tracks

15:28.460 --> 15:33.060
I'm just not gonna notice. They're gone, or if it was like hopefully it was one of like the crappy ones

15:33.140 --> 15:37.820
We can always redownload them. That's true. What about the original rock band song so

15:38.340 --> 15:43.700
You'd have to redownload them unless you sold them hmm if you sold it back

15:43.700 --> 15:47.540
Then you're kind of screwed there. I did actually never did so I still know people who still have

15:48.820 --> 15:51.740
I haven't checked I haven't checked to see what got corrupted

15:51.740 --> 15:57.340
But I haven't played rock bands since the transfer so I would I know that was probably the largest chunk of my old hard drive

15:57.340 --> 16:00.540
Was rock band songs because I have a lot of rock band songs

16:00.540 --> 16:05.180
You know because I have the rock band one exported the entire no doubt album and just like at least

16:05.380 --> 16:10.020
20 download songs on top of that so pretty crazy. Well. I finally bought a

16:12.180 --> 16:14.180
Hard drive transfer thing that's not

16:14.740 --> 16:16.300
part of Microsoft's

16:16.300 --> 16:20.580
You know transfer kit. It's actually something to dump files to your hard drive and that kind of stuff

16:21.260 --> 16:24.620
To get well on top of you know

16:24.620 --> 16:26.860
potential modding things

16:27.620 --> 16:34.580
To basically move the two popcap game saves that pop cap for some reason said no you can't transfer to us

16:34.580 --> 16:41.180
You know a memory unit. We're gonna be dicks about that, and then yeah, I love how on Twitter. They're like oh, yeah

16:41.180 --> 16:43.180
We're looking into that

16:44.500 --> 16:48.520
We're looking into I saw you got a response though that was basically they couldn't figure it out

16:48.520 --> 16:54.600
No, the response was like you have to redownload the game like what the fuck does it have to do with my save file stupid

16:54.640 --> 16:56.040
not like

16:56.040 --> 17:01.680
Transferring the game talking about the save file well wait a minute though like I theorized a couple weeks ago in this first came up

17:01.680 --> 17:04.080
Maybe this is something that was kind of out of their control like you know

17:04.080 --> 17:11.080
They it's not out of their control all the other games before and after them have allowed me to move the save files

17:11.120 --> 17:15.240
To a memory unit and you know move it to another hard drive

17:15.240 --> 17:19.120
You know you may not be able to copy them to other you know profiles

17:19.120 --> 17:24.120
I understand that that makes perfect sense, but not being able to move it at all. That's retarded

17:24.120 --> 17:29.720
You know what else did that hexick HD won't let you move this thing so screw you

17:30.640 --> 17:35.520
Microsoft and screw you popcap that's right, though. I'm gonna do it anyways. I will find a way

17:35.520 --> 17:39.200
I know we have people from popcap that listen, so I I hope well

17:39.200 --> 17:42.840
That's why it does not go on both, but you'll do and Zuma

17:42.840 --> 17:50.840
For whatever reason your stupid save files won't move not the game the game is fine because I can delete it download it move

17:50.840 --> 17:55.720
It whatever I need to do, but the save files will not move

17:55.720 --> 17:59.160
And I'm assuming this is a big crisis in your house because Zuma is like no

17:59.160 --> 18:03.800
It's not a big crisis, but it's annoying because if you know my wife principle of the thing yes

18:03.800 --> 18:08.880
We put in a lot of time to you know Bejeweled 2 which I might add there the achievements are

18:08.880 --> 18:14.520
damn near impossible to get but you know for whatever reason we put in a lot of time into it and

18:15.240 --> 18:21.320
Especially Zuma. Zuma gets pretty hard too, and at least that I can get some achievements in but Bejeweled 2 is a bitch

18:23.200 --> 18:26.760
But yeah, I don't want to lose all my progress in that you know it's a game

18:26.760 --> 18:30.640
I don't care if it's a crappy game. It's still progress, and I don't want to lose it

18:30.960 --> 18:37.160
But in the fact that you know I can understand hexick because they want you to buy the hard drives and that kind of stuff

18:37.160 --> 18:40.720
I mean whatever, but the save files is just these two games

18:41.640 --> 18:48.840
That won't let me transfer them everything else works like everything. I got all that stuff moved over and took forever, but it worked

18:49.520 --> 18:54.480
But these two save files are just I don't know so I'm gonna try moving them with this one program that I got and

18:54.920 --> 18:58.000
If that doesn't work, then I give up, so

18:59.080 --> 19:04.280
Sj100 Matt wants to point out now if Nellie lost her excite truck save file, then shit would hit the fan yes

19:04.280 --> 19:06.720
But it might give her another reason to play it again

19:07.240 --> 19:09.760
I do want to say this is Matt brought up PopCap

19:09.760 --> 19:13.480
I did play the new Bejeweled thing on Facebook

19:13.480 --> 19:15.720
They have like a Bejeweled tournament thing on Facebook

19:15.720 --> 19:19.300
Where you get like a minute to get as many points as you can and right now

19:19.300 --> 19:24.480
I'm on the top of the leaderboard at least of my friends list because you can't see everybody you can see your friends list I got

19:25.000 --> 19:28.400
55,000 in one minute I got really lucky with the chains

19:28.400 --> 19:32.080
That's all I can say but I thought that was kind of cute that they put that on Facebook, so

19:32.080 --> 19:36.680
Anyhow um so anything else for gaming weeks around anybody?

19:36.680 --> 19:39.920
I played rock band like the first one yeah

19:39.920 --> 19:45.000
Cuz that's what Julie got and I have to say I've forgotten how much I hate the rock band guitars

19:45.600 --> 19:52.000
But now I remember cuz it was forced upon me, and I hate them. Why is that they're flimsy?

19:52.800 --> 19:57.640
they may be better for strumming, but they most the time the keys stick on both of them and

19:57.640 --> 20:03.060
They wouldn't sync properly for the wireless one, and it was just a pain in the ass and next time

20:03.060 --> 20:06.340
I go over there is I'm bringing my guitar hero controllers

20:07.860 --> 20:12.500
All right watch a lot of net stuff. I know isn't the Netflix thing on 360 great

20:12.500 --> 20:15.600
I watched a documentary this week because now Netflix

20:16.340 --> 20:21.620
No, Netflix got smart, and they added an HD category on their watch instantly things

20:21.620 --> 20:26.540
I was looking at HD movies, and I watched a documentary because I've been all about the obscure documentaries on Netflix

20:26.540 --> 20:28.960
I don't know why but I watched an obscure documentary about

20:29.340 --> 20:33.380
The people that dress up as superheroes on Hollywood Boulevard and post for pictures

20:33.380 --> 20:36.540
I care ethics called confessions of a superhero was the name of the movie and

20:37.340 --> 20:39.980
It was interesting it was interesting seeing the reasons

20:39.980 --> 20:46.300
Why people did it some did it because they were like obsessed with their character some people did it just another job some people did

20:46.300 --> 20:49.420
It because they have issues a lot of issues Rob

20:49.420 --> 20:52.760
I want to come over and watch documentaries with you now that I don't have school. It's fun

20:52.760 --> 20:58.480
I said I have work. That's a sad thing. I have work, but not every day work. Yeah, I know

20:59.000 --> 21:03.280
I'm gonna come come watch documentaries with you all right. Well. It's fun. Well a documentary night

21:04.040 --> 21:06.400
We'll try to see who can find the most obscure document

21:06.400 --> 21:11.400
There are some obscure documentaries on Netflix documentaries. I got a screener copy of

21:12.120 --> 21:15.880
Eathletes uh-huh which if I remember correctly. I think that's the

21:16.480 --> 21:20.960
Film that Scott Rubin actually did some of the shooting for it's about those two counter-strike teams

21:20.960 --> 21:26.400
And they came to El Dorado Hills to do part of the tournament there

21:26.400 --> 21:30.880
And he was filming a second unit or whatever on that that was kind of neat

21:31.800 --> 21:36.920
Hmm, I don't haven't gotten a chance to watch it yet though tiger law points out. Yeah confessions of a superhero

21:36.920 --> 21:42.120
I believe all games interactive interviewed the chick that plays Wonder Woman on it, and it may set suma back set up

21:42.120 --> 21:43.960
You know I I did I was not aware of that

21:43.960 --> 21:47.600
I kind of fell out of the loop of AGI just because they were putting out so many shows a week

21:47.600 --> 21:49.600
And I couldn't listen to him because I had to teach all day

21:49.600 --> 21:54.320
But the chick that played Wonder Woman was probably the most normal out of everybody in the movie

21:54.880 --> 21:59.000
Absolutely she had some marital problems, but she seemed the most

21:59.680 --> 22:04.240
Stable I mean no quote unquote normal out of anybody there was so she didn't to me

22:04.240 --> 22:06.240
She didn't look a lot like Wonder Woman

22:06.720 --> 22:11.800
Maybe yeah, maybe that sounds cruel, but I just I just didn't see the little her costume was decent

22:11.800 --> 22:17.280
But I just didn't see like she did not look at like Wonder Woman as much as Batman looked like Batman or Superman

22:17.280 --> 22:20.760
Look like Superman. There's only one only one Wonder Woman ever and

22:21.400 --> 22:26.840
She was in the 70s, and she was freaking fantastic, and I really enjoyed seeing her in sky-high

22:28.840 --> 22:30.720
Is you gonna say something lucky no

22:30.720 --> 22:36.920
I thought it's I thought I've actually seen part of that show or Linda something that had to do with those people that were on

22:37.640 --> 22:42.840
Hollywood Boulevard you might hostile one in chat says I've seen that doc they even said that people

22:43.200 --> 22:46.720
Were protective like I'm the only one who can play Superman on this block

22:46.720 --> 22:48.720
Yeah, perhaps I

22:49.080 --> 22:51.120
Don't know. I don't remember

22:51.120 --> 22:53.160
They didn't really get into the inner politics

22:53.160 --> 22:58.680
But I thought it was really funny because like people like they like it was this big change when Elmo got arrested

22:58.680 --> 23:04.960
And they showed the news stories like Elmo and mr.. Incredible got busted on Hollywood Boulevard this week

23:05.440 --> 23:12.960
They joined the Cookie Monster in the interest for the way. They were harassing tourists or something like that. This is it was interesting

23:12.960 --> 23:17.440
It's just funny to hear the news. I want some money for drugs give Elmo money

23:17.800 --> 23:23.040
It was just funny to hear about Elmo getting arrested. I don't know why I'm easily amused all right look

23:23.120 --> 23:25.520
Let's move on with the show talking about housekeeping tonight

23:25.680 --> 23:28.860
If you were wondering there will be a show next week

23:28.880 --> 23:35.060
There is still a show next week the holidays will not be getting in the way same bat time same bat channel although

23:36.200 --> 23:40.440
Bobby the man who does the show before us is doing his annual year-end special

23:40.440 --> 23:43.880
Next week, and he's gonna have some guests on his show and all that fun stuff

23:44.400 --> 23:48.160
He might be starting a little early, and we might let him run a little late

23:48.680 --> 23:52.040
To help our yeah, maybe details a little just a little

23:52.680 --> 23:57.520
So we'll see but that means that means it made me realize that means next week is our year-end show I

23:58.200 --> 24:01.860
Wasn't even thinking about it, but yeah next week's the year-end show can you believe it?

24:02.200 --> 24:09.200
Yes, because it comes the same time every year. Yeah, and in there will be no show on the week of

24:09.200 --> 24:11.200
January

24:11.480 --> 24:18.560
11th there is no show. I'm gonna be in Hawaii. I will not be here the weekend of the 31st what cuz I'm going to Disneyland

24:19.520 --> 24:20.720

24:20.720 --> 24:24.360
Yeah, I should do we should do our gift exchange. I may go okay

24:24.360 --> 24:31.080
I feel bad though cuz I didn't get gifts today, but I'm doing anywhere. I am doing something different and experimental this year

24:32.480 --> 24:34.480
for Christmas

24:34.480 --> 24:39.440
I already gave you party ears are I know I was gonna say I thought Prince of Persia was my gift well

24:39.440 --> 24:42.840

There's Star Trek Pez dispensers. That is all kinds of rad look at that

25:22.160 --> 25:26.160
That's like the entire original cast and the enterprise as a Pez dispenser

25:26.160 --> 25:30.580
It's supposed to be limited, but I don't know that is friggin amazing

25:30.580 --> 25:32.880
And most importantly I want to point out

25:33.460 --> 25:39.740
Sulu George Takei does have his own Pez to censor. What'd you get there Sarah Ragnarok? Yes? Hi, dude?

25:40.860 --> 25:42.860

25:44.540 --> 25:46.540
Very nice

25:47.220 --> 25:52.940
Actually I was because the artwork is a different style, and so I wasn't looking at the character designs I was reading

25:52.940 --> 26:00.820

26:36.620 --> 26:39.740

26:53.040 --> 26:55.040
Got I got I got

26:55.720 --> 27:00.720
Took to your present. Okay. I couldn't think of what I want to read the card to so I try to use in these full

27:00.720 --> 27:03.180
That's fine. I appreciate it there you go

27:03.720 --> 27:05.720
That's pretty cool. They're up

27:05.760 --> 27:08.360
Yes, I don't know what that book is I didn't want to open it

27:08.360 --> 27:12.920
You know so I don't know if that's the manual or like an art book or something that they threw in

27:12.920 --> 27:14.920
I'm gonna open it right now

27:15.160 --> 27:17.160
But I figured you know

27:17.160 --> 27:19.160
Ragnarok

27:19.160 --> 27:22.120
DJ dark night brought up something about the prices right there reminded me

27:22.120 --> 27:24.200
Did you see the in chat room?

27:24.480 --> 27:28.560
Did you see the talk about the guy on the price is right that nailed the showcase on the head the manual?

27:29.560 --> 27:34.200
Yeah, I was joking about how I think that's that's a giant conspiracy

27:36.160 --> 27:38.120
There's more in my life journal

27:38.120 --> 27:43.840
Hitstun says does Ragnarok DS. Have any sort of online play. I think it's a few players like local

27:43.840 --> 27:49.280
This is fantastic because you um you do your attacks and spell casting

27:50.480 --> 27:51.680
by

27:51.680 --> 27:53.680
stylus control

27:57.440 --> 27:59.280
All right

27:59.280 --> 28:02.480
Well, what a happy holiday. We have here on orange launch radio this week

28:03.760 --> 28:05.920
Except for me. I'm a Grinch because I didn't fucking give out

28:06.800 --> 28:10.080
Well, I'm I'm doing something different this year

28:10.080 --> 28:13.040
It has this the skill trees in here

28:13.040 --> 28:17.360
I just didn't want to forget these all in my house, and I started to get into the point now where I'm like

28:17.360 --> 28:22.000
Whose gift is that whose gift is that? Oh crap? I gotta get rid of these nice

28:23.120 --> 28:25.120
All right, whoo

28:25.120 --> 28:29.840
Now that we are all bit. We've all been there's classes that are just for the um DS

28:32.000 --> 28:35.120
We're gonna hear a little tidbits about Ragnarok DS all night long

28:35.120 --> 28:41.520
There's a dark night. Yeah, if I DJ dark night and chat says Jamie wishes she could bring her online character to the DS game

28:42.720 --> 28:47.120
Quite possibly my characters are like over a hundred and twenty something right now

28:47.120 --> 28:50.400
So because I'm playing on private server. Yeah, I was gonna say plus you play on bootleg servers

28:50.400 --> 28:55.360
So I don't think that would be a dark night's fucking hot. I like J-roz star trek peso spencer

28:55.360 --> 28:58.240
What a thoughtful way to carry around your ecstasy

29:00.400 --> 29:02.400
That's amazing

29:02.400 --> 29:04.400
That's amazing

29:04.880 --> 29:08.240
That's amazing. No. I love the star trek peso dispensers. That's great

29:08.240 --> 29:13.280
You know I haven't really been like super into peso collecting in a while, but I still think stuff like this is so awesome

29:13.840 --> 29:19.520
Especially the fact that it's all of them like you didn't have to buy each one individually wow it's limited edition, too

29:19.520 --> 29:23.120
What a cool. Yeah, I saw that they have those at a cost plus

29:24.400 --> 29:28.080
That is so rad. I was like dude. I kind of picked this up for Rob. That's amazing

29:28.080 --> 29:31.040
Yeah, I thought about getting another imagine game this year for the DS

29:31.040 --> 29:34.080
But I figured actually giving you something useful instead of you know

29:36.080 --> 29:41.520
I'm putting pictures up in a second sweet all right, so anyway is that going on your Twitter all right?

29:41.520 --> 29:46.960
Well, I'll link the picture in the chat room because my Twitter is blocked from almost everybody so oh you could log into the olr one

29:47.520 --> 29:51.680
If you want all right, uh let's let's move on and get into some gaming news

29:51.680 --> 29:54.640
You know that we're past past the holiday stuff listening now

29:54.640 --> 29:59.680
We're gonna go some from such happy joyous wonderful news to not so great news tonight

29:59.680 --> 30:04.160
Not so great news tonight, and I want you to listen to the first stories in tonight's

30:04.720 --> 30:09.840
Show and see if they all have something in common because it's kind of sad actually it's kind of a bummer

30:09.840 --> 30:12.640
We have to follow up such a positive stuff with this

30:13.760 --> 30:19.440
Factor 5 has closed its doors the developer known for such games as lair

30:20.080 --> 30:25.200
And some better games as star wars broke squadron and even like turrican series

30:25.200 --> 30:31.520
Um and apparently they were being rumored to be working on the new kid Icarus and Superman games

30:32.640 --> 30:39.680
But they have closed their superman 128. It's the curse of spider-man. I'm sorry. It's superman. I tell you it's just it's a new

30:40.560 --> 30:42.720
Superman not tiny of the movie, but

30:43.920 --> 30:48.960
So they have closed their doors, and it was supposedly confirmed by Matt Casamani

30:49.680 --> 30:52.400
from IgM who had I believe

30:52.400 --> 30:54.400
received an email from

30:55.680 --> 30:59.120
Julian at Factor 5 says hi Matt. How have you been?

31:00.720 --> 31:03.360
Wanted to contact you with some late-breaking news

31:03.360 --> 31:08.400
We just learned inside sources that developer Factor 5 has officially closed the doors as of today

31:08.400 --> 31:12.400
That's some pretty big news considering that those guys have been around for quite a while

31:12.880 --> 31:16.800
It's definitely a real shame, and I hope this information is helpful to you

31:17.360 --> 31:19.760
Do you know who we have to blame for this lair?

31:19.760 --> 31:22.960
No, Ronald Regan. Why? Reganomics

31:24.960 --> 31:29.680
Seriously, that's what caused um, that's one of the big contributors to our financial crisis right now

31:29.680 --> 31:35.200
Well, perhaps it continues on in these other stories we're getting into such as about electronic arts

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Electronic arts had to cut

31:38.880 --> 31:46.400
1,000 jobs and closed like nine different publishing locations including one of them called black box studio

31:46.400 --> 31:51.360
This is in addition to when they already laid off six percent of their staff back in October

31:51.360 --> 31:56.560
So now it's just been basically an increase to a ten percent reduction overall. It was 1,000 employees

31:57.200 --> 31:59.520
That are all being phased out by March 31st

31:59.520 --> 32:03.040
So well, I guess hooray that some get to keep their jobs through the holidays, but still

32:03.680 --> 32:07.920
Blackbox studio in Vancouver is going to be merged with the EA studio in nearby Burnaby

32:09.600 --> 32:12.880
Wow, so this is going to save the company 120 million annually

32:12.880 --> 32:18.000
But costing them about 60 million in restructuring charges while this goes on

32:19.280 --> 32:24.240
Kind of a bummer for those folks that got laid off. Sorry to hear about I had some friends that worked at EA

32:24.240 --> 32:26.800
I have no idea, you know, they're not people I talk to every day

32:26.800 --> 32:29.520
So, I don't know if anybody I know isn't affected by this but still

32:30.480 --> 32:33.120
My thoughts are with you guys. This is this is very unfortunate

32:34.320 --> 32:40.320
Well, um, there actually is a going for midway to the rumor was that they were going to be laying out

32:40.320 --> 32:47.920
Laying out laying off, um around 160 people from the Chicago studio for the most part because of financial issues

32:49.360 --> 32:56.400
The official word is that they're laying 25 percent off of its workforce. So that's about 180 people

32:57.280 --> 33:00.480
130 people from Chicago and 45 from Austin

33:01.680 --> 33:06.400
The Austin operation itself has closed and then there's supposed to be some other

33:06.400 --> 33:11.840
Games that were unannounced that are being suspended. So they're just trying to uh,

33:12.560 --> 33:19.200
I guess mitigate, you know, whatever the costs are apparently the Mortal Kombat team is safe. We can all sleep

33:19.920 --> 33:21.920
Easy, I think

33:22.640 --> 33:25.200
Whatever. It's just crap

33:27.120 --> 33:28.000
And

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Even more upsetting for me

33:30.000 --> 33:36.720
Free Radical has closed shop. Um, apparently their doors were locked and all the employees were locked out

33:37.280 --> 33:42.640
While the company was having some final meetings deciding what the fate of the company was going to be

33:43.200 --> 33:45.600
Of course Free Radical is known for the

33:46.240 --> 33:52.320
Kind of a failure ps3 game haze but better known for their time splitter series as well as um,

33:52.960 --> 33:56.000
Remember to be working on Star Wars Battlefront II

33:56.000 --> 34:01.280
They were working on TimeSplitters IV. Um, so that kind of sucks

34:02.320 --> 34:04.320
but um

34:04.320 --> 34:10.960
The good news is though is they may not be out of work for long. Apparently some other companies are looking to

34:12.000 --> 34:17.040
Purchase Free Radical and kind of absorb them into their

34:17.760 --> 34:18.800
You know

34:18.800 --> 34:25.360
Developing firms. So that's kind of good because I want to see TimeSplitters IV. It was kind of neat since they were

34:26.000 --> 34:26.960
You know

34:26.960 --> 34:33.200
Looking for new jobs. Some of the people are working on different art. We're releasing assets for TimeSplitters IV and oh man, it looked awesome

34:34.560 --> 34:41.280
Also if that doesn't work out, the founder of Free Radical is setting up a new studio called Pumpkin Beach

34:42.000 --> 34:44.800
And right now he's got 20 former

34:44.800 --> 34:48.320
Free Radical developers and um,

34:48.960 --> 34:54.160
You know, there's going to be that seems like a lot of development for just a week. Did this all happen this week?

34:54.720 --> 34:59.040
Yeah, wow. Yeah. Um, so I guess

34:59.920 --> 35:05.840
The guess will the the new studio had been formed a few months before this whole

35:08.080 --> 35:10.080
I guess

35:10.080 --> 35:16.080
Um, I guess, uh, the thing happened. So, you know, this was

35:16.880 --> 35:22.160
You know working out before everything. Maybe he kind of figured that this was going to happen anyways, and so kind of a

35:23.020 --> 35:25.020
precautionary measure but um

35:26.080 --> 35:28.720
That's what I'm wondering if this guy didn't kind of see the writing on the wall

35:29.280 --> 35:35.600
Maybe but um, yeah, hopefully some way or another that TimeSplitters IV comes out. That's really all that i'm concerned about

35:35.600 --> 35:40.080
You know that and that these people have jobs, but mainly TimeSplitters IV

35:40.080 --> 35:44.880
GameGuru in chat says this is what happens when you don't support the console that won. That's the Wii my friends

35:45.200 --> 35:50.000
Oh, but wait a minute. Look at EA. They just laid off a bunch of people. They they've been big supporters of the Wii, right?

35:51.680 --> 35:53.680
They've been sort of, yeah.

35:54.960 --> 36:00.080
GameGuru says the economic crisis just accelerated the problem. I can't really say Free Radical

36:00.080 --> 36:06.400
Wasn't supporting, you know, the Wii. They've only made one game since the new consoles have come out, you know, Haze, so

36:07.920 --> 36:09.920
That's not really fair

36:10.560 --> 36:14.800
Well, another company is seem to be cutting back on staff. It's uh,

36:15.440 --> 36:19.360
I'm sorry, Asper is the name of the company and they are based out of Austin

36:19.920 --> 36:22.080
They're probably most known for some of their porting work

36:22.080 --> 36:27.360
They ported Call of Duty 4 and Sims 2 to the PC and the Mac respectively. They got hit with layoffs this week

36:27.360 --> 36:34.100
They got hit with layoffs this week more than a dozen temporary full-time employees were laid off as well as some other regular employees

36:34.480 --> 36:38.800
More layoffs are expected and the company also shut down internal servers

36:39.920 --> 36:43.200
Also some other stuff they did Guitar Hero 3 they did that port

36:43.760 --> 36:51.760
Wow, so, uh, no, uh comments out of Asper that I should note though that that story was just a rumor status only

36:51.760 --> 36:57.360
Um, however, it unfortunately would not be surprising considering all the other news we're hearing this week

36:58.480 --> 36:59.760
well

36:59.760 --> 37:01.760
It's not really just those we've got

37:02.320 --> 37:03.280
more

37:03.280 --> 37:04.560
turbine

37:04.560 --> 37:06.080
is um

37:06.080 --> 37:07.600
going to be uh

37:07.600 --> 37:09.600
cutting jobs

37:09.980 --> 37:11.360
according to uh

37:11.360 --> 37:18.480
What they're saying is that they are actually going to be um, they didn't say how many but the quote says as part of this transition

37:18.480 --> 37:22.400
Some of our talented colleagues will not be with us going forward

37:24.080 --> 37:28.400
So ouch yeah, in other words are like oh fuck bye

37:30.880 --> 37:32.560
Really

37:32.560 --> 37:39.280
So let me point out that's one two three four five six companies in one week

37:39.840 --> 37:44.160
That have all done some type of layoffs right before Christmas right before the holidays assholes

37:44.160 --> 37:51.520
Although granted some of them have uh, you know our um, like ea was transitioning them out on march 31st or whatever

37:51.760 --> 37:55.280
But some of them just came to work and found that the doors and windows were all locked

37:55.760 --> 38:02.000
Which is I don't know kind of messed up. It's it's just sad. I mean that reminds me of when dan got laid off in the money store

38:02.560 --> 38:06.960
Really? Is that what happened similar? They just went in found a bunch of people walking out with stuff

38:07.040 --> 38:09.040
And so they're like, um, just pack your desks and go

38:10.160 --> 38:11.600
wow

38:11.600 --> 38:13.600
My gosh, they bribed us to stay

38:13.600 --> 38:15.040
um

38:15.040 --> 38:19.040
Here's my question. Is this going to continue? I mean this was six in a week

38:19.040 --> 38:24.080
Are we gonna see more throughout the next few weeks or what's gonna happen? Blame Reagan blame Bush

38:26.560 --> 38:33.920
I I who's next blame the Republicans. Well, wait a minute though. Let's not get too political here

38:35.520 --> 38:42.360
Seriously if you look at it historically the reason why you're wearing all this financial shit is because of

38:42.360 --> 38:47.880
of reagan's whole reaganomics crap and the fact that you know people have decided just to

38:48.440 --> 38:52.440
You know screw us over instead of you know, putting money back into the economy where it goes

38:52.520 --> 38:56.120
You know, we're spending money on a war. We didn't need to spend you know money on

38:56.840 --> 38:58.680
And all this other bullshit

38:58.680 --> 39:02.920
It just should have looked out what the country needs and go for the best thing and now as a result

39:02.920 --> 39:07.880
We're seeing and it's not just this there's other companies like I went to uh old fulsome

39:07.880 --> 39:14.600
Today and I say yesterday and at least a third of the old shops there were either closed or going out of business

39:15.560 --> 39:17.720
The coffee place I go to they close down without a word

39:18.440 --> 39:24.200
It's just you're seeing more and more businesses closing down. It's not just in the video game industry

39:24.920 --> 39:29.160
Regardless of you know, whatever path we took to get here. How are we gonna get out?

39:29.400 --> 39:34.040
I guess would be my question is I mean is the end in sight are we gonna get out of this anytime soon?

39:34.040 --> 39:38.120
What's it gonna take? I mean, do we just need to buy more video games or what?

39:39.720 --> 39:46.680
Well, it's a lot more complex than that. I mean a lot of it is going to be consumers, you know having more faith

39:47.640 --> 39:50.680
In the industries and you know putting their money into product

39:51.320 --> 39:57.320
But um, it's also going to mean that to be able to put money into the purchase of products

39:57.640 --> 40:02.680
There need to be the jobs available. So it's very much right now a catch-22 damn if you do damn if you don't

40:02.680 --> 40:05.080
It's it's really gonna take

40:05.720 --> 40:10.680
I think the companies being able to be in a financial position to where they can start hiring again

40:10.920 --> 40:17.960
And start putting out more product so that these people who now have fresh incomes can go out and put their money back into the the

40:18.520 --> 40:23.640
Money flow. Oh, we'll see what happens in 2009. Hopefully it won't be much longer. We'll see though

40:24.440 --> 40:30.840
Moving on um, you know all this news makes us very sad and upset and angry that all these uh,

40:30.840 --> 40:35.640
Great game studios are just closing their way on well some not so great, but they're all closing their doors

40:35.640 --> 40:40.680
Uh, it just stinks the whole thing stinks. And so we uh dedicate the fus of the week to uh,

40:41.640 --> 40:43.640
Those without a job this week

40:43.640 --> 41:01.960
Is that a job this week my first fu goes towards my girl bits for hurting me and causing you pain

41:02.440 --> 41:05.400
Therefore I have to turn around and hurt other people and cause them pain

41:05.800 --> 41:09.640
Because they don't have to endure this type of thing. So we have to share it with them somehow

41:09.640 --> 41:17.080
Um, also, um an fu goes um on behalf of one of my friends who didn't necessarily say this herself

41:17.320 --> 41:19.320
But i'm passing it on for her

41:19.560 --> 41:23.960
Um to uh the lack of uh proper transplants for her dad

41:24.440 --> 41:29.880
um, she is a really good friend of mine from college and I hope that her dad gets uh, the liver and

41:30.520 --> 41:32.520
other organs he needs soon because

41:32.920 --> 41:34.680
He really really needs it

41:34.680 --> 41:41.080
And um, my my final fu goes again towards the bullshit that um, bush is pulling

41:41.720 --> 41:45.560
In you know in his last few days god, I can't wait till he's gone

41:47.560 --> 41:48.440
Loki

41:48.440 --> 41:52.200
Um fu to rude people at the stores, especially this time of year

41:52.440 --> 41:55.800
Uh, there was some lady in front of us when we were trying to buy some

41:56.360 --> 42:00.620
You know gifts and first off she's taking forever with her transaction

42:00.620 --> 42:05.660
And kept wanting to you know, do idle chit chat and then when she was done

42:06.060 --> 42:12.860
Uh, she sat there and started packing her crap into her purse for a good like three or four minutes

42:13.260 --> 42:20.700
We're still waiting there trying to like get our shit done like the checkers already, you know running ourselves by and you know

42:20.860 --> 42:24.540
She's just sitting there going, you know, trying to talk to the person stuff

42:24.540 --> 42:28.060
I was like get the fuck out of my way you stupid whore

42:28.060 --> 42:34.140
So a few rude people and then there's a ton of people can't drive correctly, especially now in the rain. So

42:34.700 --> 42:36.700
Screw them, too

42:37.020 --> 42:40.380
um, my a few of the week goes to the fact that i'm

42:41.180 --> 42:47.020
Feeling pains in my side and I don't know if i'm just imagining it or if it's something weird happening again or what have you

42:47.020 --> 42:50.460
I'll try to go to the doctor. Maybe it is my uterus. I don't know but you know

42:50.460 --> 42:55.420
I don't know like I just get freaked out. It's been a hell of a year. I just want 2008 to go die in a fire

42:55.420 --> 42:59.020
First of all, I would like to uh, tell the entire chat room

42:59.580 --> 43:07.580
Don't wish assassination, you know, that's you're wishing murder on somebody however complete incapacitation of both bush and cheney

43:07.900 --> 43:14.460
Would be fantastic if someone were to do that because that would put flossie in charge until obama takes over she is a speaker of the house

43:15.340 --> 43:20.140
All right. I want to know uh, and my other a few goes to uh, selfish people

43:20.860 --> 43:22.860
That's it

43:22.860 --> 43:28.380
All right, in uh early 2009, we'll be receiving a brand new game

43:28.940 --> 43:36.300
From the creator of such wonderful games as katamari damasi and all the other sequels. Um,

43:36.940 --> 43:41.820
Takahashi, um is releasing nobi nobi boy on the playstation network and

43:42.380 --> 43:46.700
They had a few videos that came out this week for it and I still don't know what the hell this game's about

43:46.860 --> 43:50.060
It's like you're this stretchy thing that

43:50.060 --> 43:55.500
Tries to hook a bunch of things up with your body and I don't know what exactly that's supposed to be for

43:55.900 --> 43:58.700
But apparently, uh, you can stretch your body

43:59.500 --> 44:01.500
You can devour things

44:02.700 --> 44:07.740
I'm not really sure what exactly you do, but it's supposed to be coming out in japan

44:08.380 --> 44:10.940
on january 29th for 800 yen

44:11.820 --> 44:16.380
And uh the us probably around the same time so early 2009

44:16.380 --> 44:20.860
But man, this game is weird and it's not like that trailer that we saw. It's not 2d at all. It's just

44:21.900 --> 44:26.060
Weird well, you know, we did say that katamari damashi was weird, right?

44:26.620 --> 44:32.140
Yeah, but this looks really weird like even like katamari. I you know, you could watch a trailer and get it

44:32.140 --> 44:37.820
You know, you just oh you roll over things and your ball gets bigger this is like it's giant tube thing eating things and

44:38.140 --> 44:40.140
Tying things up with its body

44:40.460 --> 44:42.940
I don't get what the point is. That sounds fantastic. It's like

44:42.940 --> 44:49.340
Bizarro snake it is like a bizarro snake. It's like, you know, everyone's like all happy and stuff and he starts eating people

44:49.340 --> 44:54.380
And it's like oh my god. This isn't good at all eating people is great

44:55.900 --> 45:00.060
Nom nom nom. Nobby. Nobby's made of people. It's good

45:02.380 --> 45:07.840
Hey little big planet got some updates this week. You got two patches back to back 1.06 and 1.07

45:07.840 --> 45:14.960
1.06 now it uh, it upgraded the moderation feature of the game, which a lot of people would say was badly needed

45:15.920 --> 45:22.560
Now your unpublished levels can be edited by creators. They will not be erased for Evers and believe it or not

45:23.200 --> 45:26.960
You'll now get an explanation when your level is moderated. Tadaa!

45:27.680 --> 45:31.600
Finally after all that bitching and moaning some updates to the moderation

45:32.400 --> 45:37.120
1.07 was also a good one. It was a good one. It was a good one. It was a good one

45:37.120 --> 45:43.200
1.07 was also released like almost back-to-back this week and now you can actually find user-created levels a lot easier

45:43.280 --> 45:48.560
Apparently the cool levels has a different algorithm. So it's not just a bunch of trophy whoring levels anymore

45:48.880 --> 45:50.960
Which is kind of cool. I actually went in there and looked and it actually

45:51.600 --> 45:56.400
It was some different stuff in there, which is kind of cool. And now they've also added the little big store

45:57.200 --> 45:59.680
Kind of like how they added the store and rock band a little later on

45:59.680 --> 46:03.520
Well now they have a another world that you go into. Well, it's it's still earth

46:03.520 --> 46:08.320
but it shows the little pictures of little suits and other things that you have yet to buy and

46:08.960 --> 46:13.680
Confirms which stuff you have already purchased for the game. So that's kind of cool and also very cool

46:13.680 --> 46:17.760
You know, they I know a medium molecule and Sony in general took a lot of shit for the moderation

46:17.840 --> 46:20.960
It's nice that they are making attempts to fix it. Thank you

46:21.760 --> 46:23.120
What?

46:23.120 --> 46:24.800
This is just what?

46:24.800 --> 46:26.240
What?

46:26.240 --> 46:29.440
I clicked on the link in the chat room. Uh-huh that was

46:29.440 --> 46:34.560
Uh posted by tiger claw, uh, which I think we're covering later in the show. Okay, then never mind. Yeah

46:36.320 --> 46:38.000
That's what I get

46:38.000 --> 46:40.560
Well, how about some different news about sing star?

46:41.840 --> 46:47.360
they're doing wireless microphones that will be out next year and um

46:49.360 --> 46:51.360
They're uh

46:51.600 --> 46:56.240
Actually, uh saying that there's going to be a hundred uh trial packs also

46:56.860 --> 46:58.320
available to

46:58.320 --> 47:01.200
Uh, I guess just a number of different sing star

47:02.400 --> 47:04.400
followers on their myspace

47:04.800 --> 47:08.020
But the packs are going to be two wireless microphones usb receiver

47:08.960 --> 47:12.960
a mini b usb cable and four double a batteries

47:13.840 --> 47:15.040
so

47:15.040 --> 47:18.320
Like I want one for sing star abba, which by the way

47:18.960 --> 47:24.320
There is now a sing star abba theme in the playstation network store that you can download for your ps3

47:24.320 --> 47:28.880
What that you I don't know we know it all yet, but you know, it's coming out next year

47:29.280 --> 47:34.480
What here that's coming out also in europe or may have already come out what sing star queen?

47:34.960 --> 47:38.320
Oh cool. I heard about things. I heard there was there was a queen one coming out

47:38.560 --> 47:41.040
I'm, totally gonna buy that in the us now. Awesome

47:41.600 --> 47:46.160
That is exciting because queen is all sorts of awesome queen is very awesome

47:46.800 --> 47:50.160
Oh, it's gonna have the videos and everything. I bet huh? So rub. What is your favorite queen?

47:50.240 --> 47:53.440
That's gonna be amazing. You know, I have to stick with the old um

47:53.440 --> 47:55.440
uh, bohemian rhapsody, but

47:56.080 --> 47:58.400
I do have a big love for bicycle

47:59.360 --> 48:00.720
What about you matt?

48:00.720 --> 48:09.040
Uh, bohemian rhapsody and no one or was it a no one wants to live forever. I think my favorites would be um

48:10.160 --> 48:15.760
Um somebody to love that's my favorite of all time. And oh, that's a great song. My second is killer queen

48:16.960 --> 48:20.240
These are all good songs. I can't wait for this game. That's gonna be amazing

48:20.240 --> 48:24.960
You know, the only thing that would be better would be sing star journey, you know, I had to say it sing star heart

48:25.520 --> 48:30.400
See now it would only be good. I think that these are just a queen pack for a rock band. So that'd be a lot better

48:30.400 --> 48:31.600
Yeah

48:31.600 --> 48:33.600
They do need to have sing star butt rock

48:34.240 --> 48:36.800
That would be amazing. It's poison and motley crew

48:37.760 --> 48:39.760
and uh

48:39.920 --> 48:46.320
That would be sweet. Uh, and I have to have cinderella and dakken and night ranger

48:46.320 --> 48:48.320
And night ranger

48:49.600 --> 48:53.280
And dan yankees because of ted nugent well other things

48:54.400 --> 49:01.840
Nugent everything's awesome. And also from sony, uh pots upon two is um out in japan right now

49:01.920 --> 49:03.920
But it will be coming

49:04.640 --> 49:07.060
to other regions in early 2009

49:08.460 --> 49:11.520
february and probably north america and um

49:11.520 --> 49:16.720
Yeah pot upon is actually pretty cool. I didn't get to play a lot of the game. I just kind of gave up on it

49:16.720 --> 49:18.720
After a while, but it was fun

49:18.720 --> 49:23.120
Definitely unique little game and you know, i'd like to see more in that crazy style

49:23.120 --> 49:28.160
But i'd also like to see it like on other systems, you know, I don't want to have to always bring out the psp to play this

49:29.280 --> 49:32.580
Port that shit because it'd look awesome on the ps3

49:32.580 --> 49:40.500
Because it'd look awesome on the ps3 pata pata pata would it it was a very interesting little game

49:40.900 --> 49:43.620
Rob i'm cold. It would be even better

49:44.260 --> 49:46.340
a heater if the buttons um

49:47.140 --> 49:50.900
Spelled out or sung out of damn yankees songs. That'd be great

49:51.940 --> 49:52.820
I

49:52.820 --> 49:59.540
Hate everything about your mother. That wasn't damn yankees. No, I oh i'm thinking that was ugly kid joe. I'm, sorry

49:59.540 --> 50:04.020
I'm thinking uh high enough was damn yankees, wasn't it? Because it's fucking ted nugent

50:06.820 --> 50:11.140
Ted nugent eats meat and shoots guns. I like this man

50:13.620 --> 50:16.740
Uh, all right, I saw him on tv skinning a deer

50:19.540 --> 50:21.540
Ted nugent's fucking hot

50:22.660 --> 50:25.860
Uh, unfortunately won't be able to skin a deer a little big planet, but

50:25.860 --> 50:29.140
You will get paint guns, which is kind of cool. I mean

50:29.140 --> 50:34.260
I do have a challenge out there for you folks to make a level where you do skin a deer. You can probably do that

50:35.220 --> 50:37.460
I have to actually I have to go back to ronma

50:38.100 --> 50:40.100
Queens ryke is the shit

50:40.180 --> 50:47.060
Although you misspelled it because queens the lead singer of queens ryke is a trained opera singer and he's just got this fantastic voice

50:47.220 --> 50:51.460
Anyway, i'm sorry. That's right. I would like to see um sack boy's house of blood in um

50:51.460 --> 50:57.780
Um in little big planet. I want to see some really I did disturbing levels one time and I I just never got around to

50:57.780 --> 51:03.460
Actually trying to make anything in this game, but you know thought about it making a saw themed level

51:03.460 --> 51:05.780
But you know, I couldn't figure out how I could

51:06.420 --> 51:08.420
You know do that

51:08.740 --> 51:13.140
I don't know. Well, maybe some of the new items in the metal gear solid pack will help you because yeah

51:13.140 --> 51:14.580
They're getting paint guns

51:14.580 --> 51:19.060
Um now apparently you're going to get a paintball gun that you can use to actually shoot down enemies and all this stuff

51:19.060 --> 51:24.580
Apparently trophies are being added go figure like 11 trophies are being added in this pack

51:24.580 --> 51:31.540
But here's what I don't understand about this is that I I was assuming that the metal gear solid thing was for users to create levels

51:32.100 --> 51:33.940
But it is but so why?

51:34.500 --> 51:39.940
Why then are there these new trophies because shouldn't I get to play it still if somebody else makes the level using it?

51:39.940 --> 51:41.540
Or am I going to get locked out? Here's the thing

51:42.420 --> 51:44.820
This level pack you're downloading you get

51:44.820 --> 51:50.900
It's a level and then you get objects including this paintball gun from the plane that level and there's trophies tied in with

51:51.220 --> 51:55.860
The few levels that are there basically the levels are to teach you how to use the paintball gun because

51:56.260 --> 51:58.820
The paintball gun is going to allow you to make shooter games now

51:58.820 --> 52:04.020
They're going to have objects that will detect how many hits with the paintball gun before they are destroyed

52:04.260 --> 52:08.820
Also remember before how people were trying to create objects that like shot bullets and stuff

52:08.820 --> 52:16.180
Well, now they have some sort of like energy blast things that come out of them. It's a new sort of like damaging object

52:17.060 --> 52:20.500
That's going to be available and you'll get all those by playing through levels

52:21.140 --> 52:25.300
So that's gonna be awesome then it that is a very major download

52:25.860 --> 52:30.260
Instant purchase from me. I'm also well. I'm happy to hear the media molecule is doing some of this

52:31.300 --> 52:37.060
Themselves because the levels they did were some of the best honestly they really really were it it was a very

52:37.060 --> 52:43.220
They really really were it it looks really cool. I mean it if you watch the trailer for it very very cool looking

52:43.380 --> 52:47.780
Yeah, I do watch the trailer. It looks very cute. I just didn't understand how it worked a little bit contra

52:47.860 --> 52:53.060
Well now I understand well, hey now this is also kind of neat is that they're also getting some level packs not just for this

52:53.060 --> 52:55.460
But they I guess this just came out this past week

52:55.860 --> 52:58.580
Um, I don't remember seeing it on the store, but I didn't really look very hard

52:58.820 --> 53:03.560
Um, the holiday pack is now apparently out. It was supposed to come out december 18th for 299

53:03.560 --> 53:11.660
and uh, it's the festive level pack and it's supposed to contain two new costumes some new material new objects six new decorations

53:12.120 --> 53:18.520
And tons and tons of tons of new stickers, but however, um with this pack levels themselves are not apparently included

53:19.320 --> 53:21.960
So, but they just have the stickers though. Yeah

53:23.480 --> 53:27.640
So I guess you put this in your own levels or what have you because you can create new, you know

53:27.960 --> 53:31.880
Christmas tree looking things and you know everything with the stickers. Hey speaking of stickers

53:31.880 --> 53:35.880
When are we going to get that feature where I can uh put photos from the hard drive into the game?

53:36.200 --> 53:38.600
Because that's that's the other big thing we're waiting on

53:39.160 --> 53:41.500
But it was in an advertisement. It's false advertising

53:42.200 --> 53:44.200
bitch wine moan

53:44.360 --> 53:46.360
Right, you're never going to get it

53:46.840 --> 53:48.840
I wish maybe next year. We'll see

53:49.480 --> 53:51.480
Well, this is something that's pretty cool. Um

53:52.120 --> 53:57.800
You know, uh on xbox live there was the um, super street fighter 2 turbo hd remix

53:59.000 --> 54:00.440
well, um

54:00.440 --> 54:04.360
It's uh sold a quarter million. Wow. There's a lot of suckers out there

54:04.760 --> 54:09.560
Well, I I have it. I like it. I've got so many different versions of street fighters. Not even funny

54:10.040 --> 54:13.640
That's 250 000 people sucking the cock of nostalgia. It's

54:14.360 --> 54:18.920
It's basically broken both day one and week one sales records

54:19.800 --> 54:21.160
and um

54:21.160 --> 54:26.200
Is uh slated to break 30-day sale records as well. So it's supposed to be the the um

54:26.200 --> 54:31.720
Oh, actually according to capcom. It's quoted as saying it's honest way to becoming the highest grossing digital title ever

54:32.280 --> 54:35.800
Besides that they had the good sense to use udon crew to do their art. So that's pretty cool

54:38.680 --> 54:40.680
Very cool they didn't sell one to me

54:41.400 --> 54:42.840
well

54:42.840 --> 54:47.720
Unfortunately this week there aren't that many choices for you to go purchase stuff. I mean it is

54:48.360 --> 54:54.440
the week of christmas and a lot of game publishers aren't exactly putting their games out this week because uh,

54:54.440 --> 55:01.720
That's not a lot of time to purchase them. But there are a few that are putting out their games and um, well

55:02.920 --> 55:05.080
They're games. All right, um

55:05.880 --> 55:12.520
Candace canes candy factory on the ds is coming out this week. Also the sport comic book creator

55:12.520 --> 55:19.000
I don't really know if that's a game. That's more software, I think but it's coming out nonetheless. Um,

55:20.200 --> 55:22.200
Let's see here

55:22.200 --> 55:24.200
Let's see here

55:26.280 --> 55:28.280
And

55:28.840 --> 55:33.080
Man talk about a short week mystery pi portrait of a thief on ds

55:35.160 --> 55:41.160
And I swear that I think that's it that is it that is sad

55:44.600 --> 55:50.680
Well, it is kind of a quiet week as well over in japan because they usually get new releases on thursday and what's thursday

55:50.680 --> 55:52.680
Oh, yeah christmas

55:52.840 --> 55:59.960
So, um on the xbox 360, uh alone in the dark and sid meyers civilization revolution finally come out on

the xbox 360

56:04.040 --> 56:05.160

56:25.960 --> 56:28.920
Don't laugh. It's the roid stick ds. So there you go

56:30.200 --> 56:36.120
Um, there were a couple games I missed but I don't know fun fun mini golf on the wii tiki towers on the wii

But it's on the wii and I can't figure out like is this the old school?

56:57.560 --> 57:00.920
Resident evil being redone because I don't think it's resident evil 4

57:01.480 --> 57:08.760
It must be like from redone port of the first game or something. Uh peakman gets its wii upgrade this week as well

57:08.760 --> 57:12.280
Or pickman peakman, whatever. Uh, maybe that's that biohazard zero

58:18.760 --> 58:23.000
Yeah, it's only in dallas. They don't give a crap about that stuff. Anyways, that's what pisses me off

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Because i'm like totally excited to play it. They're like

58:27.000 --> 58:30.760
Whatever. All right. Well, let's move on around the world with more releases. Um,

58:30.760 --> 58:32.440
Two things for the uk

58:32.440 --> 58:38.120
The 23rd is savage moon on playstation 3 and on the 26th boxing day

58:38.840 --> 58:40.840
Is 100 classic book collection

58:42.200 --> 58:43.240
Yeah

58:43.240 --> 58:48.280
It's just not a big week in games. I I reckon not. All right. Well, there you have it

58:48.280 --> 58:53.240
We have to do the release dates no matter what even if it's slow week and don't expect next week to be much better

58:54.200 --> 58:56.200
Because it's not

58:56.200 --> 59:02.520
But you know, it is uh, pretty big the text in banjo kazooie now because uh,

59:02.520 --> 59:05.480
There's that brand new patch for those people that own the 14-inch

59:06.680 --> 59:08.520
standard definition

59:08.520 --> 59:10.520
You know tube tvs

59:10.840 --> 59:15.560
You now can read your text in banjo kazooie and suffer through the dialogue of that game

59:17.320 --> 59:23.880
So, um, well, thank heavens because you know, I was just waiting for the no, I actually I was just

59:23.880 --> 59:28.680
you know, I was just waiting for the no, I actually a lot of people really were waiting for something like this to come out because

59:28.680 --> 59:35.000
If you play it on the small tv, this game's next to impossible to play. I'm spoiled with my hd tv. So I need to just

59:35.720 --> 59:37.720
Stop taunting those that don't have it

59:38.280 --> 59:43.560
Correct. Yeah. All right. Yes. All right. Well, um, we're just about to the end of part a tonight

59:43.560 --> 59:46.220
But hey, we've got to uh, take some time to recognize

59:46.220 --> 59:53.180
Gaming's classics and that's what we do here in a segment. We call the classic game of the week

59:53.740 --> 01:00:00.400
Oh dark sakura, what have you picked for this very special holiday week for the kids and uh adults out there to recognize?

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:07.820
This week in gaming i've picked a bit of the nes and uh, commodore 64 for you. Rob

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.260
Yay, joy in the form of maniac mansion

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:13.260
Maniac mansion

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:18.140
Maniac mansion is a weird little game

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.700
This music's from the nes version yeah

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:32.780
But it was originally on the commodore 64 so where um

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.900
It actually uh is the game that the uh

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:43.260
Scum engine was created for the script creation utility for maniac mansion

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:50.700
And lucas arts used it for about uh, 10 more years to keep playing it. It also um has chuck the plant in it

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:56.460
If anyone has looked at other lucas arts games that that character's in but anyway as the game goes, um

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.140
There was a purple meteor that made a big crater

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:06.060
um on the line of this big mansion that belonged to the edison family and um

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:12.620
So basically there were changes in the people that lived there and then uh people that were in uh

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.620
the

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:21.340
Hospital started disappearing. So then there were a bunch of people who uh decided to go into the house because

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:27.660
A local cheerleader turned up missing and they decided to go through the entire house, which is like this big

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.540
movie type horror

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.620
house thing with um

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.580
Tentacles and an evil genius and the pool

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:43.660
The pool is the best part it has different multi- it has you know multiple endings you can go through depends on who lives who dies

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:50.300
You can have a you know, a perfect ending you can have the adversary win you can have um

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.660
You can have them famous by publishing his autobiography. You can feed them to a plant

01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:01.740
Um, and um, you can you know, get your players in the game killed and um,

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.820
it has different red herrings in it and um

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:14.140
Just kind of different weird stuff in the game. Um, the different characters in there is you have the sort of

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:19.020
James dean type character you have a new wave musician

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.820
You have a photographer

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:29.100
You have a novelist. Um, you have a big nerd who's uh, really scary. YAY NERD!

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.860
You've got um a punk rock girl

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:38.080
You've got um a surfer in there. They all have their different strengths and weaknesses

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.860
and um

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.780
I've played this of course on the nes because that's what I had. Um

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.900
The uh, the different versions there were there were there were

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.660
the uh, the different versions there were there was also a pc

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.900
that um

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.340
also, uh

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.340
played um

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:04.220
There's also the apple 2 the amiga and atari st versions

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:10.220
Um, there was the nes versions and instead of it being the full size. They were all kind of sd

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.940
Super deformed, you know the different characters

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.420
um

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:22.300
And there is actually um an enhanced version with updated graphics that's out and it had a sitcom based on the series

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:26.460
Do you ever remember watching? Oh, yeah, I remember that. Oh god, that wasn't on very long

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:30.300
But yeah, I remember there was this game was pretty big when it came out and there was a fan

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:36.860
Um remake that's called maniac mansion deluxe that runs on windows. Um, the has really

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:44.140
um enhanced graphics and music that was actually borrowed from day of the tentacle and um

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.540
it supposed to fix a lot of uh,

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:53.660
Bugs and inconsistencies and they put in some different changes to make it a little bit harder. It's also playable in day of the tentacle

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.540
maniac mansion

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:03.100
Um, and of course then there was it was really really centered though on the nes there were a lot of stuff changed

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.900
um

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:10.220
There um was only one printing of the game

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.780
um

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:19.020
They actually did forget to leave in though some of the more bloody parts like you could still microwave the hamster

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.460
awesome

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:27.740
But the pal version does not have the ability to microwave the hamster. Oh

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.420
The guy though who um

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.980
That ported it douglas, uh crockford

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.340
Put out a memoir that was called the expurgation of maniac mansion

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:42.780
Which was, you know, basically him going oh god nintendo you suck

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:49.900
um about how strict nintendo was for what they could allow in the game what they couldn't and um

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:58.780
About you know some things that he agreed with taking out like edna, you know having sexually themed threats to the characters

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.500
and different things, um

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:06.220
Including the you know, the use of violence non-violence and that type of thing

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.220
That type of thing

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.380
um

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.660
So, um, it was pretty pretty uh

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.860
Heavily centered like I said, um

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.500
also, um

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.580
There like I was saying before it was my favorite part of the game

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.820
Whenever I would just get really tired of playing it and go to hell with this

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.220
I would go to the pool drain it and push the red button so that the house would explode

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.220
I

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:40.300
Just what I did every time I was like i'm tired of playing explode game over

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:47.900
I didn't think the graphics on the nes version were that great compared to the computer one. No

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.540
Which is strange because i'm talking about a game on the commodore 64, but

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:59.260
The commodore 64 version was actually really nice. I personally did not play it, but I have seen it played

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:02.320
Um, because like I said, I didn't have a commodore 64

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:08.940
I had a clicko adam. I have to say though as far as this type of game goes on the nes

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.780
There is a game. I do prefer these point-and-click games shadow gate

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.060
Shadow gate was great. Yeah, i'm talking you know

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:21.420
You know what part I would always get those stuck at was where you went into the the portal and you had a limited time

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.020
with your um

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.260
You had to actually have like some item to make it through the portal

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:30.300
You're gonna need to do that in a future week. I'm gonna have to I actually never finished shadow gate, but I love shadow gate

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.460
but um

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:36.620
It's just interesting because you don't think about these point-and-click games a lot on the nes because they they you know

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.620
But there were some really good ones

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.740
But um, yeah this it's a really good one, you know also, uh

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.940
There's some of the uh, lucas arts, uh, i'm just looking at the list of the different lucas arts, uh

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:53.580
Um titles that they were supposed to go along with the scum engine

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:58.780
And let me get back to that because I was just on it. It was um, I think a couple of monkey island games

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.820
and uh labyrinth and loom

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:09.020
And I think i've covered loom before which is strange because I think loom came out before maniac mansion didn't it?

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.580
Uh, no, it was after no, no, it was after

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.780
Strange it was after monkey island even I think

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:22.460
But yeah, um some uh, and actually, uh, one of the salmon max games was supposed to use it, but they uh, canceled it

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.940
It was a salmon max freelance police

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.220
And full throttle payback was another one

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:35.920
But yeah, um some of the different ones that used it was uh, monkey island 2 lachuck's revenge and indiana jones and the fate of atlantis

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.460
So well there you have it

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:45.020
If there's nothing else to add then your classic game of the week is blow up the house

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.060
maniac mansion on the

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:55.260
Maniac mansion on the nes or commodore 64 whatever system you prefer maniac mansion

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:57.420
And don't forget to drain the water for the pool and blow up the house

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:59.900
That's dark soccer's favorite thing to do, correct?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:01.980
Indeed

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.860
All right

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:07.500
Well, uh, we're going to take a quick break here on orange lounge radio and do some music here

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:12.860
And uh when we come back we have plenty more actually, sorry the podcast folks. You won't get to hear the music

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.940
That's just the way it is, you know copyright rules and everything

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.620
But uh, we'll be back really soon with more of orange launch radio more stories

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:23.740
Hopefully a little bit happier than all the layoff stories we had in uh part a do you think we can arrange that low-key get?

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:26.700
Some happier stuff in part. Maybe tonight. All right, we'll try

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:30.140
Um, meanwhile, we're gonna go ahead and take a break and we will be right back

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:41.580
And welcome back to more of orange lounge radio and this part b of our podcast for this december the 21st

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:46.160
Of 2008 and uh, happy holidays to you guys out there listening to the program

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.440
Uh, we talked a lot about uh different things going on in part a unfortunately a lot of really not so happy

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.680
Holidays going on for a lot of folks in the game industry

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:59.040
And i'm ready to hear that. Uh, we talked also about some other um news including um,

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.920
Some sales stuff about uh, hg remix and some little big planet updates and some other news coming to the sony world

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:12.160
But now we're going to move in and start off tonight talking a little bit about microsoft in part b. Yes, logy. Yes, we are

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:18.980
Not exactly great news, but uh microsoft has announced that fable 2's expansion

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.680
Um, nahole island

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:29.140
Not coming out for christmas. Unfortunately, uh was due out this week. It is now being delayed to the end of january

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:35.080
Still going to be 10 bucks. Apparently they ran into some unexpected technical difficulties

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:40.020
At least they didn't call it balloon nahole island. I mean that would have been really bad

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.700
Just saying that would be horrible

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:52.100
It's why why the delay, um unexpected technical difficulties, whatever that's supposed to mean

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:58.260
Uh, everyone took some time off for the holidays. I still don't think it's a good name to name it nahole island

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.260
anyways, it just

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.980
Makes me think of like a glory hole or well, haven't you ever heard of what a balloon knot is?

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:13.300
That's supposed to be like an asshole because you know what a balloon knot looks like an asshole exactly and this one house in san diego

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:22.100
And every time I hear not whole island I keep thinking of a balloon knot hole and it's disgusting i'm like who wants to visit an island

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:27.140
With a bunch of assholes. There's a house in san diego that looks like a sphincter

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.260
Make all the gay jokes you want, but that does not sound appealing. I'm, sorry

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.980
So there you have it

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.060
Anyway

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:44.340
I'm sorry, i'll move on i'm trying to eat a bagel while i'm talking and making jokes. I need to stop eating cookies

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:49.140
Uh tiger claw says every time I hear not whole i'm thinking of sonic am

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:53.940
Uh moving on

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.720
Eight hundred point microsoft point cards now have made their way into the retail marketplace

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:06.500
um, apparently, um, you know, you could only get 1600 microsoft points before it was 1999, but now

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.440
You can get 800 microsoft point cards at retailers for 9.99

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:15.620
And hey, that would be one whole cent cheaper than buying them online. Oh, but you have to pay tax

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.740
So you're screwed then you have to consider this tax

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:24.900
So it's good if you don't like if you want to give a gift or if like, you know, you don't have a credit card

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.660
And you're a little kid

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:28.180
or

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:31.620
Or you want to buy it as a gift, but you know, it's it's a stocking stuffer

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.660
So maybe 20 bucks is too much. I don't know just buy it online

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:40.340
Yeah, I guess you know what I want, but they don't world peace. No not world peace screw world peace. Um,

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:48.100
But they're not available in most stores is those playstation network cards because I hate the playstation network and how they do their

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.900
Payments online. Yeah, it's a little silly. I don't like it by the way

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:55.940
speaking of playstation network because you brought it up and I forgot to mention earlier in the show we talked about playstation home last week

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:59.140
And I said I was going to get an olr club as soon as they open it up

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:03.940
Well, I guess I missed it because I went back online later in the week and I saw where you could buy a clubhouse online

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.220
It was just hard to find

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:11.300
Um, i'm not interested in it because you have to invite people into the club and you can only invite up to like 30 people

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.620
What kind of an olr club is that?

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:18.180
Not a cool one, unfortunately, I know we have more than 30 people in our chat room tonight

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.100
We probably would have more people now than what I do

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:24.420
I thought it was something that people would be able to search and go into you know at their leisure

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:29.940
But I don't see how it's promotion for the show to do that. It sounds stupid then I'd have to buy all the furniture

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.940
So forget it

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:38.180
Until home gets cooler. I protest. Sorry. Well, there are probably only about 30 of our listeners that actually have a playstation three

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.260
Yeah, true true

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:45.140
Sj100 matt in our chat room wants to point out. Um, I see psn cards in best buy

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.860
Entertainment says not only that clubs cost money fail. I was willing to like for five bucks

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:56.020
I would have done it like it's an experiment. How much was it five bucks five bucks? Okay. Yeah, and I'm still considering it

01:12:56.020 --> 01:13:02.180
Here right now. It's five bucks with no re no reoccurring fee, but sony is going to implement them at some point

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:06.100
You just didn't say what like home doesn't suck enough

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:11.140
Do now do we have the trophy rooms and stuff like remember how they're saying? No, nope

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:17.300
So like most things it's extremely early like most sony will get i'm sure home will be better in a year

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:23.220
But by then we will have all forgot home is extremely late as it is. It's no time for being early. It's late

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.220
It's

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:32.580
Just saying I know all right, sorry we can go back to um, um other stuff now, sorry jamie, okay

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:35.460
sega

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:39.780
What about them? Well, it looks like um, there's been some esrb, uh

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:47.860
Ratings put out so that means that they're going to be a number of games on um xbox live and playstation network from sega

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.620
There will be um, a sonic 3 comic zone

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:54.900
fantasy star 2 and gun star heroes, whoo-hoo

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:58.260
which are uh supposed to be uh

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:02.580
Out and then um, there were I guess other releases. Um

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:10.260
I'm, sorry, uh, the previous releases were sonic the hedgehog sonic 2 golden axe and echo the dolphin and streets of rage 2

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:17.860
Wait a minute, but isn't sega putting out that thing of like 40 games for like 20 bucks or something. Yes

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.420
Yes, do you think that sega wants as much money as possible? Yes, okay

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.860
Say yeah, are they giving me anything special?

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:28.340
with this

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:33.860
I guess and they're going to give you the option to blur it out so that it looks all like, you know hd like

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:37.960
Seems kind of just buy the 20 thing when it comes out. Seriously

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.140
Unless they're not i'm, sorry

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.780
Which I highly doubt that they are all right, we'll see what happens

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:49.540
Something else coming to xbox live arcade kind of interesting

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:55.800
I'm, not sure a lot of people are familiar with the um, mmorpg dofus

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.380
They have a uh

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:06.820
Game, I think it's called uh wok fu and now the islands of wok fu are going to be coming to xbox live arcade

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.820
So it's like an mmo

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:15.140
But not you know, it's got the mmo graphics. I guess the perfect example would be like ragnarok online ds

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:20.100
You know where it's not technically an mmo game, but you play it similar to the mmo

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:25.300
It's just you're not going to be interacting with other people. In fact, that's the tagline. It's like an mmo, but not

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:33.700
But um, yeah, it's apparently set a hundred years or a thousand years after wok fu it's due

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.940
Uh late 2009 and will be an adventure beat them up title

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:44.580
As an adventure beat them up and venture beat them up as adventure slash beat them up all style game

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:53.540
It says it can be played in a two-player team mode and uh will reveal never before seen background content from the world of dofus

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.100
and wok fu

01:15:56.740 --> 01:16:02.740
Really because to me the entire world of dofus and wok fu are unseen and I have not played either one

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:08.180
But hey, it's a different type of game and that's always welcome bochi kawa in chat asks wok fu

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:10.340
Is that like beating people senseless with a frying pan?

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:15.060
Yes, it is exactly now that would be a great game

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:19.700
Go around and hit people with a frying pan. Actually, you can kind of do that little big planet. I just want to say

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.260
uh, hey talking about um

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:28.020
Hey other things we might want to hit in the head with a frying pan is uh, whoever caused those xbox 360 discs to scratch

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:33.620
Apparently there's some lawsuits going on right now. You know, we reported on those a while ago, but now they're just finally getting around to you know

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:39.700
Being looked at investigated what have you and a document in one of the suits was actually unsealed last week

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:45.300
Apparently my and what it contains in it is that microsoft actually knew about the problem prior to launch

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:49.620
They have multiple options to fix it and the company rejected all of them

01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:54.020
There were three options apparently listed in the document one of them was a

01:16:54.020 --> 01:17:00.100
To increase the magnetic field of the disc holder and the reason why they decided to reject that is because it would get in the way

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:05.060
Of the disc opening and closing thing. Um, but here's here's where I go crazy when I read that

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:09.300
My 360 is having issues when I try to open and close the door on it right now

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:14.260
Like sometimes i'll have to hit the button multiple times and i'm starting to worry that the damn thing's about to break on me

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.260
Have you heard of anything like that loki?

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:18.820
no, but I know that the way they have the

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:25.620
Eject button and also the um, like power switch and stuff. It's really funky like the power switch

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:29.700
There's a little button that's off center on it. So if you push it in the center of your

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:34.580
Face plate it won't exactly trigger it every time you kind of push to the right of it

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:39.300
So and the way the eject button works is kind of similar

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:44.340
It's a little push button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out, but it's kind of like a push button switch

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:49.700
It's kind of like a push button switch, so I wouldn't be surprised if it wore out, but you know

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:56.100
You can always if you can't get it to eject that way just you know, hit the middle button and select eject disc

01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:01.700
Great jrod in chat says I used to have to do that and it ended up where the disk drive wouldn't read anymore

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.700
lovely

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:08.420
Um, remember they won't warranty unless it read rings. So that's when you take a blow torch to it

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:10.980
Well, look, there's some other options too

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:16.580
The other options were to slow down the disc rotation speed but that was rejected because it would have slowed down the game loading times

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.260
I think we can understand that one

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:23.940
uh, and then um, apparently the other option was to install little bumpers that would have cost the company between

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:30.260
35 to 75 million additional dollars, but I would think little bumpers wouldn't that be like maybe like a buck?

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.500
a machine

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.220
Yes, it's it's literally that little um

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:40.100
They had a fix a long time ago when people were ready to scratch thing that was available online

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.100
You'd buy these little um

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:46.660
It looked like a cd and you would put it in the drive and kind of push it up and it would stick little

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:53.060
Pads on there that would you know keep the disc from jiggling because basically what happens is since the disc has so much play

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:59.300
Inside the drive it'll end up, you know bending back to where it rubs up against the laser and that's what carves a nice little

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:02.260
You know circle into your disc

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:06.660
So this what these do is allows it so that the other side

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:10.260
Doesn't tip as much so doesn't ever make contact with the laser

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:17.380
Well, here's the thing is that um the and the big thing that the document shows is that microsoft what they eventually decided to do

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:21.860
They appended the manual with a warning and offered a disc replacement program

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.900
You know that was their big fix and I believe something about like a sticker on the door too that you have to pull off

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.900
That warns them not to tilt the machine when you play

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:34.340
Apparently this was deemed insufficient by company employees via an internal email

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:37.860
But it's apparently what happened. Anyway, well, it is kind of I mean

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:46.900
It's a stupid fix and really they should have just added those little bumpers to it because it wouldn't have cost them 75 million dollars

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:52.980
I mean how many consoles they have out there? They have like almost fifteen thousand, you know, fifteen million consoles or not

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:56.180
Even really that many but like over ten million consoles. Okay, so

01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:01.700
You know, they're saying seventy five million dollars. So that's seven fifty per console

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:05.860
Um, or no, that's 75 million. That'd be 75 cents per console, basically

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.900
so

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.700
Or no my math's all wrong today. Well act whatever it doesn't matter either way

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:18.820
It's not gonna cost that much act up in chat says but who the fuck moves around a console when playing a game really?

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:25.620
Well, some people own pets like my cat who likes to jump on consoles and um,

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.780
You know, she may knock it over luckily

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:33.380
I'm smart enough to know if the cat's nearby the console. I will lay it flat on the ground instead of you know

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:36.340
Tipping up and that's you know, that's a rare occasion, you know, or

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:41.220
We just took ours away where she can't get to it. Yeah, I mean it's someone can bump it

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:46.260
You know a court get pulled or something knock the console over. I mean, there's all sorts of stuff that can happen

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:51.540
It's rare, but there are cases though. I've been hearing where people's discs are just getting in a groove

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.420
Carved into it just from leaving it

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:59.380
Going it's just on you know, the way the laser moves or something that there's some

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:04.660
Jittering in there that causes like a ring to kind of carved in over time

01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:09.700
Not necessarily like where people were tilting the console. It made a nice little like grinding noise

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:13.780
Uh, gs68 says microsoft needs to fix the d-pad from hell agreed

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:20.740
It's getting to the point where i'm actually considering buying like some games on the ps3 over the xbox 360 completely based on the controller

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.620
completely based on the controller

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:29.460
Completely based on the controller whatever happened to that controller that was supposedly coming out that had a better d-pad

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:33.960
I never saw that and why they would do that for a limited amount of time is retarded

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:40.180
That's a very good question. I I have no idea why they would do that. Uh, and tiger claw wants to say, um,

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:41.940
Well, he says a couple things

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:46.180
He says it's a conspiracy microsoft knew all along with the disk scratch problem before the public found out

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:49.300
I smell a class action waiting to happen. Actually. It's already happening

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:54.100
That's where these documents came out of but then he goes on to say microsoft needs to fix the tray eject problem

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:56.740
A lot of people are experiencing it. I'm not the only one

01:21:57.300 --> 01:22:01.300
And bobby blackwolf wanted to work in a cheap plug for his upcoming new show

01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:07.540
He said the first episode of friday night gaming will address that issue directly on stage with a company that repairs consoles

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:11.780
Apparently one little shtick they're going to do on their show is actually repair consoles live on air

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:16.340
On his little friday night show he's starting I believe the 9th of january is the first episode

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:20.660
Straight out straight out of atlanta or I have a console that's under repairables

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:26.180
What because i've tried repairing it really remember that should be a challenge that I took a heat gun to you

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:33.380
Should see if bobby will take it on bobby and his friends. It can be fixed. I'm sure if they re-bulb the um GPU on it, but

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:39.700
I don't have the device to do it. Let alone the patience or the skill necessary

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:43.780
It's gonna be like trauma center for consoles. That's gonna be amazing

01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.780
So check that out

01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.780
friday night

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:51.780
Fnglive.net if I don't say the website then bobby will say I hate him. All right

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:57.780
Let's move on with more news. We'll see what happens in further developments with the uh disc scratching

01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:00.780
Oh, hey, no, we're not gonna move on with more news

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:05.780
We don't want to do any more news. We're done. We're out of here. Have a great night everybody. Bye. All right

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.780

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:20.580
She does it because she has to yep

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:30.100
So mailbag orange lunch radio.com. Let's read some of those emails

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:33.300
Um, hey, olr. This is amay satsuma

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:38.420
My question to you is if you were able to throw an object at someone what would that object be?

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.820
And who would you throw it at must be non-lethal?

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:45.140
Does this have something to do with the bush shoe thing this week it must

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:48.340
Um, I actually would

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:52.100
If I could completely get away with it without you know

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:57.460
Um the secret service trying to jump me or anything. I would throw something at bush

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:00.340
um, I would throw um

01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:02.680
um, basically the uh

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.320
Waste of a homeless person at him

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:14.680
Feces no overall waste. Oh, okay. Yeah and say that it was his fault

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:20.440
Um, but that's that's hypothetical that's not not that I would physically do that

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.400
So i'm not breaking any sort of constitutional law by saying it would be cool if that were to happen

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:32.840
But um, can I answer can I answer go for it, um that crazy messed up, uh, uh,

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:39.320
Fags go to hell guy. What's that guy phelps phelps? Yes. I would like to throw a cream pie at him

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.560
But what a waste of a yummy pie

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.560
So I will throw um throw rainbow sparkles feces pie

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.240
Here's some shit cake

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:57.020
Here fred phelps have a shit cake what about I like that idea millions of dollars at myself

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.840
That would mean you'd have to have it to throw it at yourself first

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.720
No, I would have to have a million dollars in my hand, which means I would have acquired millions of dollars

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.680
Win-win either way I have to look at it

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.000
I like that. We've invented a new word on the show tonight shit cake. I like that

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.880

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:38.440
It's cute. It's it's the joker avatar in front of a fire. I think I saw that as a signature on another forum

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.440
I thought it was funny

Anyone heard anything about elder scrolls travels for psp?

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:13.560
And do you really think there will be it not?

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.500
T h e i r it should be t h e r e

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:20.220
Well typing on a psp

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.300
It doesn't matter spelling is spelling

01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:26.700
And also, um e and r are right next to each other e and i are not

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:32.300
If it uses qwerty, um, and do you think that there will be a little big planet for psp?

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:41.020
Hope you enjoy the song as much as I enjoy your show reese, uh, bc canada. My birthday is december 26

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:43.020
lol, 15 wu

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.360
Um, yes on little big planet on the psp. I think that's inevitable at some point

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.800
But that may not be done by media molecule, but I think sony will cash in on it

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.240
Um, if it's not done by media molecule, i'm already worried. Um

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.680
As far as the other games in 2009 god, what's coming out on psp in 2009? There's not a lot right now, right?

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.040
No, there is

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.400
Really? Yes

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:08.480
Tell me some of the titles. I have to look forward to star ocean second. Um, we're the second star ocean games coming out

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:14.560
Uh resistance retribution, uh, loco roko 2 pop the pond 2

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.400
Try anything else, uh monokina

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:28.260
It's coming out on psp. Where's africa psp?

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.200
So i'm gonna know where's africa ps3? That's true. Wasn't it supposed to be out by now?

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.520
Yeah, they're picking up a national geographic license

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.920
I was this close to importing it and I was like fuck that I can't run over the animals

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.880
So I said no i'm not buying that uh, dissida when it comes out in english

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:51.680
Yes, dissida will be coming out over here in the summer. Okay. God. I can't wait to play that. Um

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:59.520
I don't know. It looks like a better year definitely because 2008 sucked and like you look at the releases

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:03.120
There was just not a lot of releases period I mean there were some good ones

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:09.760
I mean the midnight club la remix is supposed to be pretty good. Um, you know star ocean. The first one was pretty good

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:17.680
I could go for some more of the final fantasy. Um ports to uh, the psp. That would be awesome. Like, uh, you know, maybe

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.240
six

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:25.440
Six would be nice. Did we get all the did we get all the questions in that email? I think we did. Oh, I zoned out

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.640
Sorry

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.640
Um, yeah, we did. All right

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.400
um

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:33.040
Moving on to the next email

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:39.600
Um, I just thought I would update you folks as to what's going on regarding the situation with my stolen

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.900
P uh ps3 this is from spazzinator

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.320
Oh, yes

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.040
He called in uh last week or the week before to mention it

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:51.360
It got stolen and he wanted us to kind of put out the word for all our fans in buffalo

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360
Of which I don't know how many we have but we tried

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:57.120
To date the buffalo police have not done anything about it and let's face it

01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:02.720
Unless the ps3 was jelly filled or covered in sprinkles. They aren't likely to look for it. Frankly. I have no faith in them

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:08.480
My counseling agency has been has been helpful as a wet fart read. Not at all

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:14.160
You'd think that since the theft occurred there that they'd be eager to have this issue resolved just to cover their collective asses

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.000
but it looks like

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
that isn't the case as

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.080
Oh, I lost my place actually as a related note

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:27.920
And if I neither mentioned it in the call, or you haven't figured it out already. I bought my ps

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:34.420
I brought my ps3 to my counseling agency for an informal party. I was supplying the entertainment movies downloaded on psn

01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:37.840
karaoke rock band guitar hero world tour style

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:45.600
Etc. It was stolen between 12 15 p.m. And 1 15. Um p.m. Est. Wouldn't that be am

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:52.800
Um, oh no, i'm misreading it on uh est on 11 19 when it was unattended in all likelihood

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.280
I won't be getting my original system back, which is a shame

01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:02.080
I had the 60 gigabyte model which are impossible to find not only that but I upgraded the internal. Um htd

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:10.800
And bought a ton of stuff off of the psn store anywho luckily my ssi payee is sitting on my rainy day fund

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.560
And sent her request for the adequate funds to replace the system with a used 80 gigabyte model

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:22.720
And the same type of upgraded hdd that I had before i'll worry about the movies and tv shows that I bought at a later

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:29.120
Time and date. Sorry for the long as hell email. Trust me. It's not and I figured that you'd appreciate an update. Take care

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:36.000
Well, thanks for letting us know well stolen systems suck and whoever stole your system needs to die in a fire and let's just hope

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.800
That karma comes around and bites this person in their big fat ass

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.440
Next email next email j-rod

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.360
Hey folks

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:48.260
I haven't heard the last show but I don't know if this has been asked if it has please disregard

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.680
But if you could ask santa for one gaming related christmas present and don't worry about price santa is bringing it

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:59.280
What would it be mine would be a new computer to play left for dead because I can't even run the original halo

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:03.780
This email is sponsored by the olive garden home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.880
you first

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:11.040
Um, I don't know if it's gaming related, but I would like a new computer

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:16.320
Well, see I have a new computer for the gaming but I would just like a whole new like setup for the show

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.560
I'd like like a fancy new mix board

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:23.520
Um an easier way to publish a show on a faster computer without having to transfer to my new one

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:28.320
Which has kind of been slowing things down technically gaming related. Um, I technically because it has to do with the show

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:34.320
So that would be my thing. I'd want a fancy like I want a state-of-the-art computer recording studio

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:36.320
That's what I want. Yeah

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:40.160

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.640

Really? I can't say that there's too much that I would really want that I don't already have

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.280
um, I actually want a uh

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.920
a pc engine duo rx

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:06.340
A pc engine duo rx and an arcade card so that I can play sapphire

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.480
And I want a baby pac-man machine fuck yes

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:17.040
Well, you know, you know what the hell are the studio just bring me a baby pac-man machine

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:21.440
I already have the pinball machine that I really want. Uh-huh. I have my world cup soccer

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.980
Can you believe that dan actually asked me if I would trade it temporarily?

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:29.200
Okay, i'm gonna go I can't go on a completely like random tangent for a minute for it

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.680
Okay, here's the thing it is related though. Um, I on twitter

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:39.200
I follow some other podcasters some other indie podcasters and one of the podcasters I follow is one of the guys from video game outsiders

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.960
And he posted a youtube today. I guess he picked up some new. Um

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:49.360
Popeye machine or something. I guess what he does. He has like like how you amass a bunch of pinball machines in your house

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.680
He amasses a bunch of 80s, uh stuff in his basement

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.360
Not a bunch of babies

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:58.880
Hey, I found this baby at the mall

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:04.480
No, i'm gonna take it home and raise it to do my work. No, you stop trying to start a podcast war

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.560
I could just see it now dude the guy

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:11.760
I can see they're gonna read an email on the show the guys from olr said you have babies in your basement

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.680
What do you have to say about that they're crunchy

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.640
No, no, no, but he's got like all these old school 80s machines I was like, oh cool cool and like, um,

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:26.160
you know, I was I was looking at the pop I wanted but I went to his youtube channel because I was like

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:29.840
I wonder if he shows off other stuff like this and he does and one of the youtubes that he had

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.040
Was him getting his new baby pac-man machine

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:40.320
And I have to admit it's the first time i've ever really watched something like that another podcaster did where I was completely

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:45.600
Overcome with jealousy like just total jealousy. I was looking at it going

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:51.120
That is so cool. I am so fucking jealous. I want I want one of those fuckers so badly

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.520
Even the baby pac-man sort of sucks ass

01:33:54.480 --> 01:34:02.420
It does novelty. It's it's the novelty of the only successful incarnation of video and pinball has been pinball 2000

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:04.960
Really?

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.960
So there you go

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:10.720
God now they're gonna get I can just see it now who said you keep babies in your basement

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:13.860
No, it's baby pac-man that he had in his basement that I was completely

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.120
And utterly overcome with jealousy. Yeah babies

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:21.040
I mean if I could find one of those machines cheap, you know, I would put that shit in this garage

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:26.640
You wouldn't find one cheap. Good luck unless it's completely destroyed and gutted. I know last email dan

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.600
Come fix my baby pac-man because I don't know dick about pinball games

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.440
Last email. Okay. Hey, olr. It's from cheeseburger, by the way

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:41.200
Well me being the huge star crash fan as I am

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.920
I never started playing world of warcraft because I would become addicted

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:49.600
Well yesterday I went to my friend's house and he started a free trial of wow

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.700
He had 256 megabytes of ram out of the two gigabytes recommended

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:58.480
So I started a trial on my laptop because it has one gigabyte of ram so he could play

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:01.040
Without much lag while I was there

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:06.800
Well, I got home and started playing for a few hours. So my question is for sky what server or whatever it is

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:12.400
You it's called do you play on I play on the garithos. Did I spell that right?

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:18.160
Right server i'm level nine and I wanted to know if it's worth buying and if I can switch server to play on with you

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.240
Also, tell me a little about the game and some of the things that will convince me to buy it

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:24.960
I'm going to give you an answer

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:30.800
You weren't expecting because if I remember right cheeseburgers like 15 years old 14 15 like he's a younger listener of ours

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.200
My advice to you is not to buy world of warcraft

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.960
Because you're still in school and if you get sucked into a game like world of warcraft, um, it could affect your school

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.880
Here's the thing if you know in your heart and in your gut in your mind

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.400
You can restrict yourself to playing this game one or two hours a day tops

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.760
Then it might be okay, but honestly, it's the social element

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.520
That's what really these games are all about

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:55.520
I mean I could describe all about like the quest and the classes and the magic and all this stuff

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.000
But you know what? You're playing the game. You see all that firsthand

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:01.760
The reason why people get addicted to this stuff is the social element. It's logging

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:07.360
It's it's you know, when I log on to the game and I say hello to the guild everybody goes rob, you know

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.240
It's like walking into cheers the bar and everybody yells norm. It's it's that kind of thing

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.880
That's that's the reward that you're going to get out of a game like warcraft. Um that being said

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.880
I play on the server raven crest and if you want more information, it's all in our forms

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.320
That's a cheap plug for the forms

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:27.280
And that way people who only really really want it will get it

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.960
But yeah, it's kind of I know i'm like such an addict of the game. But you know

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.600
Uh, i'm also not in school

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.640
And uh, sometimes even I have to really limit myself on how much i'll play

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.440
Yeah, that's actually sort of a reason why I have I really

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.480
Am loath to get back into world of warcraft myself

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.760
It's because I know how little time i'll have to play except like maybe on a weekend and then when you're still enjoying

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.320
Ragnarok the thing that sucks too is that if you get far behind the rest of your guild you start to feel like

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.560
You're just out of it. You know what I mean?

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.840
So that's you know, the competition's a lot. So

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.880
There you go. That's that's my honest advice

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.240
Ta-da, so that was it for emails

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:10.560
I said that didn't I? All right. Sorry. Well, I wasn't listening surprised gee rob. All right. I don't listen to this show

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.560
I just talk on it

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:16.740
All right. That's it for emails. If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange launch radio.com

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.240
We'll get some more stuff from you later during the skype line

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.400
Even though I don't know how long we can go tonight because it's fucking freezing out here in the garage

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:29.040
But we will get some more stories first. It's not as cold as it was last week. It's still pretty fucking cold

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:36.000
It's still pretty fucking cold. I love this quilt. Oh, it's so cold. All right, uh logi, um, there's rumors that

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.000
the uh

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.720
PSP is getting another revision. Uh, the PSP 4000 is apparently due out late 09

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.480
This is coming to us from Eurogamer that reports their publishing sources

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:53.360
Indicate that uh Sony is planning on doing this and eventually will launch a PSP 2

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:59.360
I mean, I think it's a no-brainer that they're eventually going to launch some sort of portable gaming system later on, you know

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.840
Update the hardware that kind of makes sense

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.000
um, and it wouldn't you know be a surprise if they

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.880
Fix some more stuff on the PSP again

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.440
But of course Sony is saying they have no plans for a PSP 2

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:17.600
Where have I heard we have no plans for something before?

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:24.720
Oh, I know on every other rumor that they have no plans on like no plans for a pice cut no plans on releasing a 160

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:30.640
Gigabyte system no plans for doing something that it's completely obvious no plans to release a good system

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.120
We have no plans on ever becoming the number one console

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.840
again

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.840
So when you hear no plans

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.160
Hear them saying it's like we are, you know, so

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.800
yeah, just

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:50.640
Big deal. We know hardware revisions coming. Not a big surprise

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:54.880
A sequel to a popular handheld system might happen you think?

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.760
Hello. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.080
Hey, uh moving on over to Nintendo who has been number one lately

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:06.080
Although amongst the hardcore gamers, uh, some of us are starting to feel a little jaded

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:11.840
I don't know. This is something that some hardcore gamers will be into but probably more for the casual crowd and the young folks

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:19.380
Um, some of the early 2009 releases for Nintendo, of course headlined by Pokemon Platinum on March 22nd

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.480
That is going to be a pretty big title on the Nintendo DS even though isn't it just the last two Pokemon?

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:26.640
It's it's just like they do this all the time

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:31.520
They release, you know, like, you know red and blue and then there's yellow that has something special, you know

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:34.800
It's it's it's just I think there's supposed to be new pokemons in this one

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:41.440
All right, then again and it also has some weird like uh level structures and stuff. It's like kind of neat looking interesting

01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:48.480
Um some other games that are coming out, uh Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echo of Time is supposed to actually come out this spring

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:54.080
So we'll see what happens with that. Um, let's see. What else is supposed to come out here? I've got like a whole list

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.720
um

01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:02.720
That is spring that they said that game would come out March. Yeah, probably the later the better, um

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.040
For them not drag quest five

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.720
Is that on

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.640
That's on DS. No, I don't see it listed in their list not in the first three months of the year

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:16.720
Oh really be a little later. No, unless it hasn't been announced yet. I don't know

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.480
I'm trying to look at some first part

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:22.080
Let's see Sega's putting out the house of the dead overkill on Wii in February

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:25.120
Sonic and the black knight in March and mad world in March

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.560
Ubisoft's got Tenchu in February and broken sword shadows the Templars in March

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:36.880
Nintendo, first party games, the only stuff they're putting out Mario power tennis in March and Pikmin in March

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.960
That's it on the Wii. Yeah on the Wii

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:44.480
However on the DS from Nintendo personal trainer math on January 12th

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.880
Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon on February 16th and the before mentioned Pokemon Platinum

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.040
Which is kind of in line with their one title a month

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:56.640
Konami however is putting out the new Elibits game the adventures of Kai and Zero is coming out first quarter of uh,

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:04.160
The new year the suikoden tactical game suikoden tear crease is coming out on in the first quarter as is little magicians magic

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.160
adventure all those from Konami

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:14.640
And then I'm trying to see Ubisoft has a bunch of games coming out imagine cheerleader imagine family doctor imagine ice champions

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:19.600
And American pop star road to celebrity what an awesome year it's turning out to be

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.640
For the Nintendo DS. Did you see what they named those?

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:26.640
You remember the play on the Wii games new play control

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.240
Yeah

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.800
That's a retarded name. Just call it like I don't know cash cow Pikmin

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:38.240
I do want to point out Konami is putting out a game on the Wii that some of you guys might care about ddr

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.920
Disney grooves

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.640
For those that are still playing ddr after all these years. There you go

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.320
Ssh 100 matt in chat says factor 5 goes down, but sonic team is still around. Where's the justice?

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.320
Where's the justice?

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:56.480
That's that for first quarter lineup

01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.920
Well, how about something very cool for all of our?

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:06.960
8-bit fans which by the way, thank you for the old school Nintendo entertainment system dar

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:11.760
Sakura's kind of like a second Christmas gift slash late birthday gift. Well also thanks sauce for

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:17.360
Thank you sauce to the trade for agreeing to a trade that I got the better end of the deal of

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:26.000
Well, um, if anyone who is a big Nintendo fan, this is especially cool. Also, it's really cool for the fans of pac-man champion

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.680
Edition, it's been remade for the Nintendo entertainment system

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:36.960
It actually is fully functional actually just like the same. It looks pretty damn cool

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.920
Looking at a video here on this site. Sorry. That's what you're hearing in the background

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.920
I'm looking at a video here on this site. Sorry. That's what you're hearing in the background

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.400
Interesting looking

01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.200
I don't know. It seems like it's a hacked ROM of some sort because the music in the background is strange

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.000
Right, it doesn't sound like pac-man at all. Anyway, there you go. That's that's what it sounds like

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:13.120
It might be trying to emulate the music from hmm, maybe well at any rate. Um, you um

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:20.560
There's no idea where you can find the ROM. It's from the pac-mania soundtrack. Oh, is it? Oh

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:25.600
Sorry, if that was loud guys, it wasn't loud to us in the studio, but I guess it came out very loud over the um,

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:30.800
But hey whoever whoever finds it then let me know what you think of it. So cool

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:36.080
Yeah, apparently the weird thing about this is that it's it's still unknown if this is like real or a concept thing

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.800
Because no ROM has showed up out there

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.680
Who knows

01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:46.660
That's the weird thing about it. Is it like it's not something you can actually like download for use in an emulator

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:50.000
But they say it's an actual 8-bit nintendo game

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.480
I don't know

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:59.920
Um a game that is coming out on the ds, uh grand theft auto chinatown wars has been dated now for um march

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:05.300
Which is weird because I thought it was dated before for january, but either way it's coming out now march 17th

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:09.440
grand theft auto chinatown wars and uh will feature

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.680
most of liberty city

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:12.240
um

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:17.840
I think they're cutting out all their need from um grand theft auto 4 but most of it and it's going to kind of look

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.920
a little bit like um

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.600
The old grand theft auto 1 and 2 games, you know kind of a top-down 3d

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.640
Type of game and it's all cel-shaded

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:29.280
but still violent and

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.280
pretty cool looking

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.600
Yay, cool looking things

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.240
Europe will be getting the game three days later on march 20th

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.680
Well, that's good that it's not getting delayed so bad. Yeah

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.120
And I can't wait to try the online multiplayer. That'd be fun

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.280
Of course tons of people be cheating in it because they can i'm sure

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:53.920
Okay, so, um, here's something interesting going on I don't I don't know what the hell you want to call this

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.800
But I don't know if you've heard about this project. It's called bob's game

01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:01.920
And it's this guy who's spent a lot a lot of time making a particular ds home brew project

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.000
He's apparently going on protests

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:11.440
He's going to be spending 100 days locked in his room locked and barricaded from the outside to protest how nintendo has been treating his project

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:18.480
Here's the thing he needs a ds software development kit to get his game which is um

01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:22.800
I guess what bob made is some type of like 2d adventure thing. It looks really cool

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:26.720
He actually wants to sell it as a retail game, but nintendo will not give him one

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:32.320
Even though bob has apparently talked to nintendo done the application told he was going to get an answer in a few months

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:36.960
And apparently 17 weeks have come by no answer. No kid has showed up

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.800
However, now what he's going to be planning is his 100 day sit down protest. So he's doing a tantrum

01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:45.920
Basically, he's throwing a fit fucking grow up

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.640
Well, he's been giving the run around with you know stuff and his game does look really cool

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:52.560
Um, that's kind of too bad, you know

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:58.640
Unfortunately, i'd be hitting up other publishers or whatever and see if they can publish your game or there's more. I gotta read all this

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:03.200
Um, apparently he met with nintendo in february about a year ago to ask for the kit

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.520
He teleconferenced he flew to game developers conference and had a face-to-face meeting

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:11.040
Uh, he talked to the wario world division who sent him to marketing

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:14.160
He talked to marketing and they sent him back to the wario world division

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:19.040
Uh on the application it said it would be six to eight weeks for a decision. It's been 17

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.040
He says he's met all the requirements

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:28.080
He's a financially stable registered company with an fein which I believe is a federal identification number. I'm working from a commercial address

01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:33.440
Um, and he says that when nintendo decides to approve the developer license, he will end his protest

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.440
Apparently you can actually watch on live webcam. I'm actually going to go to the site right now

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.680
It looks like he's asleep, but you can see something on the board right now says reggie on the monitor there and uh,

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.360
it is

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.640
Yep, it's actually his live confinement right now, but it looks like he's fast asleep or something or he left the room

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.960
But he's on day 12

01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:58.000
He's not supposed to leave the room. He's not it says he sleeps behind the camera. Oh

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:03.200
Where's his potty i'm assuming I hope that's all behind the camera too or something

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:08.000
But anyway, um, he says he cannot leave the room the door is locked and barricaded from the outside

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:13.040
He's sleeping behind the camera. Yes. There is a shower food is being delivered once a week by a friend

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.440
There is no internet access television or game consoles besides the ones he's developing on

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.880
He can receive and send email on his cell phone so he can get nintendo's reply and update the site

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:28.240
And the led counter will be incremented once a day. Sometimes it will display hints and secret messages

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.040
So, yes jamie he's throwing a tantrum

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:41.040
Is doing the equivalent of sticking his fingers in the in his ears and closing his eyes going lala

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:49.760
Well still though what about the point that he's meeting all of nintendo's requirements and nintendo's dicking him

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.720
What what about that to play devil's advocate? We need more imagine games

01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:00.720
We don't have time with this good adventure crap need more imagine and more pets if it's got imagine and pets in it

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:06.120
we can definitely do something with it. Oh, and if it's a sim. More sim games.

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:10.200
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, you need to get an interview with this guy. I don't know if I can. He has

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:14.900
no phone, right? I can't, oh no, he has a cell phone. Maybe I can. I guess I could try

01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:21.880
sending an email. I don't know. Misty in chat says, there's better ways to bitch about it.

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:30.200
Like not eating. Fasting. Like sending duty to Reggie. Hunger strike? Yes, a hunger strike.

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.840
That's what I was looking for. I am not on a hunger strike. I was shoving my mouth full

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:45.800
of food. I'm on a food strike where I do nothing but eat food. That's my response. All right.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:52.560
Redertainment says, imagine Bob's pet sims adventure. Amazing. All right, so good luck

01:48:52.560 --> 01:49:02.320
Bob on your protest, I guess. Um, don't die. Geez. Just kind of fucking ridiculous. And

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:12.200
by kinda, I mean really. Well, this is very, very happy, happy news for me. Because I have

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:18.200
been wanting this game, and I played the other two, and it's freaking beautiful. But Klonoa

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:24.400
Door to Phantom Isle is going to be coming out in North America. And that makes me giddy.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:32.480
And it's supposed to be out in Spring 2009. And it's supposed to be keeping the original

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:37.040
design because everybody said they wanted it. And the North American version will have

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:43.480
some gesture controls. Basic control though is be triggered to grab your enemies and flick

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:50.360
the Wiimote to throw. Which is kinda cool. Um, it has an NES style Wiimote using the

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:57.160
GameCube controller. And the classic controller is also, uh, you can use that too. And, uh,

01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:06.080
there is a rumor that the Klonoa 2 remake is on its way. Klonoa 2 is freaking hard.

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:11.360
But I really, really, really, really, really love Klonoa.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.160
Maybe this took so long to come out in the US because the Klonoa developers locked themselves

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:21.840
in a room for 100 days until Nintendo agreed to put out their game.

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:22.840
Just sayin'.

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:33.280
Hmm. Well, um, you know, after much begging and pleading, apparently EA has decided to

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:41.200
graciously allow players to be able to reinstall their copies of Spore after uninstalling it.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:46.560
They can now download a tool from EA that will let you deauthorize your PC and effectively

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:53.080
allow you to override the game's install-on-five-PCs limit, as you can manage the availability

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.160
of all five machine slots.

01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:05.280
Hooray. But unfortunately there's not a tool that's gotten me back interested in Spore

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:11.600
again, to which actually my cat knocked a disk on the floor in its case, and I was like,

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:12.600
eh, it's a good place for it.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:19.920
Nice. So do you let the cat rearrange all your furniture?

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:24.720
She does that on her own. She decides that she wants to cram herself in the tiny space

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:31.400
that is between my monitor on the shelf and the top of my desk. It's, like, less than,

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:35.880
you know, about six inches tall, but somehow she decides that she wants to cram herself

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:36.880
in there.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:39.640
But cats are cute, so she gets away with it, right?

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.080
Yeah, unfortunately she does.

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.080
What's your cat's name again?

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:43.080
Stella.

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:50.160
Stella. That's right. Uh, hey, um, the RIAA. Apparently some kitties, some cute kittens

01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:55.360
went into the RIAA office and just, they made them go, aw, and shucks, because they decided

01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:00.080
to do something nice this holiday season. They are no longer going to sue individual

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.840
file sharers or harass universities anymore.

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:04.960
Woo! That's our deadly war music!

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:10.000
Hold up, hold up. Instead, what the RIAA plans to do is that they are going to report people

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.760
that they suspect of copyright infringement directly to the ISPs. The ISPs will then investigate

01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:18.380
the customers and either issue a warning or implement restrictions, whatever they decide

01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:24.160
is needed. Apparently what the benefit will be to the ISPs, the participation is voluntary,

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:27.880
but they'll be able to better control the congestion on their networks by applying this

01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:30.080
new little policy.

01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:35.200
Some words from Ars Technica on the original report of this. Suddenly, ISPs gained a tremendous

01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:39.280
new tool. One study in the UK showed that most people sharing music would stop when

01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:43.360
made aware that their activity was being tracked and that they were not, in fact, anonymous.

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.960
Should that hold true in the US, ISPs would presumably see massive decreases in P2P traffic.

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:51.340
The customer notifications can be blasted out by email, making the whole process quick

01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:55.480
and easy for ISPs. As is usual for these sorts of schemes, questions still remain about what

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:59.980
sorts of judicial processes will be in place to contest notifications and penalties, and

01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:03.720
what happens to a household internet connection when Dad finds his access cancelled, even

01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:05.760
though he's never shared a file in his life.

01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:12.760
Yeah, whatever. It's not going to work very well, but hey, you know, whatever.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.840
So pirate away, everybody!

01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:15.760
Pretty much.

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.320
Just kidding. You shouldn't pirate, because that's why all these people got laid off this

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:21.960
week, so yeah. It was all your fault.

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:25.960
Yeah, it's the RIAA's coming after you for music. So, stop downloading...

01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:29.440
I wonder if there's any companies that are going to say, nope, we're not participating.

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.320
Go fuck yourself.

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:33.920
Yes, stop downloading music and start downloading movies.

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:37.560
J-Rod in chat says, I got a letter from my ISP about downloading HBO shows. It didn't

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:39.560
stop my torrenting.

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:45.560
Well, I've never received any kind of cease and desist, so...

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:51.560
The only letters I received from my ISP is, we're raising your rates. It's like, thanks.

01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:58.560
You know, and if you're downloading TV shows, I mean, they were on TV... I don't get it.

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:05.560
Well, some other very interesting news. Let's move away a little bit from the RIAA bastards.

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:14.720
EA and Steam have decided to make sweet love.

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:21.720
So there's going to be EA games that are available through Steam's service, which is Mass Effect,

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:28.760
Need for Speed Undercover, and Spore, and the Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack, FIFA

01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:35.760
Manager 09, and Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning. So that's going to be hanging out there.

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.560
So they're getting steamy?

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:44.240
They're getting steamy. Also, others slated for there is Mirror's Edge Command and Conquer,

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:48.680
Ad Alert 3, and Dead Space.

01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:53.680
But not mix steamy, or else the RIAA might sue them for sharing ABC shows.

01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:54.720
What?

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.280
Nothing, never mind.

01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.560
If you didn't get that joke, good for you.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.440
Who in this room doesn't watch TV? Oh, that's me.

01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:08.800
Even you watch some TV. You just don't watch TV, like, on TV.

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.120
I watch DVDs after the fact.

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:11.520
There you go.

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:17.120
I will going to be watching a show as soon as it's got new episodes on, when it airs.

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:19.400
See, American Idol.

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.520
Supernatural.

01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:24.040
What if there's David Cook 2 on American Idol next year?

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:24.520
No.

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:27.600
Will you watch that?

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:32.520
And keep in mind, I watched American Idol through YouTube.

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:38.160
Well this year they're actually getting rid of, or they're limiting the amount of the

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:40.880
bad singers that they have on the show.

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:47.280
After that I say, great, another show I don't have to watch anymore.

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:52.360
So apparently, you know, Crackdown 2 is a game that I wish would come out, because Crackdown

01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:56.200
1 was awesome, and it does need a sequel.

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.880
But of course, you know, Real Time Worlds, they're busy working on the game that I'm

01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.760
going to have to get back into MMOs for, and that would be APB.

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:08.640
But until that happens, people still wish for Crackdown 2.

01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:13.040
Well, there was a rumor that Crackdown 2 was actually being developed by another company,

01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:19.600
Ruffian Games, however, that may not be the case anymore.

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:25.360
The studio head, Colin McDonald, actually said, you know, they would like to make the

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:32.000
sequel for Crackdown, although to date they have not been offered for Microsoft for Crackdown

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
sequel.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.840
They are having ongoing discussions with them, and they would feel really hurt if Microsoft

01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:43.840
went to some other studio to develop it.

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:46.400
Wasn't there rumors that that's exactly what Microsoft did?

01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:50.920
Yeah, there was, but they don't know.

01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:57.040
They said that they would doubt that Microsoft would choose a startup, I guess it says a

01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:04.240
startup on RTW's doorstep, Ruffian, I don't know why they would choose them, I guess.

01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:07.440
Jay Roddon in chat says, Crackdown, oh, you meant that bonus disc that came with the Halo

01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:09.600
3 beta?

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:12.160
Yes, that's the one.

01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:15.760
The game is awesome, okay, seriously.

01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:17.760
Way better than the Halo 3 beta.

01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:19.960
It wasn't bad, it wasn't bad.

01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:23.120
I probably played, actually, in reality, I probably did play more Crackdown than I did

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:24.640
Halo 3, and I didn't even know the game.

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:25.640
Crackdown was awesome.

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:27.440
It was crack.

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.440
Down.

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:29.440
Down.

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:32.440
One more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to get into some last minute stories

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:38.200
in the Skype line, and this is filed under kind of a little bit of WTF.

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:43.080
Xbox Live, you know, XNA has really opened it up in the whole community games thing for

01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:47.440
people to make literally anything, and that is exactly what's happened, is literally anything

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:49.300
has popped up now in the store.

01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:56.720
It's a game, quote, fireplace, and what it does, it makes all the sights and the sounds

01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:02.000
of a winter fireplace via your Xbox 360 on the television.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.280
It's like one of those, like, you remember the old cassette tapes that was just nothing

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:09.080
but the fire that you could play in the background during Christmas?

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.080
That's basically what this is.

01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:11.080
Don't you mean a videotape?

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:12.080
Huh?

01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:13.080
Don't you mean a videotape?

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.080
Yeah.

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:17.140
But what did they call it, like a virtual yule log or something like that?

01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:18.140
Virtual fireplace.

01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:19.320
I don't know what they call it.

01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:24.440
They still have those, and they actually have Blu-rays now of virtual fireplaces.

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.640
People buy this shit.

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:27.400
That's the amazing thing.

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:33.880
We should make the official OLR yule log and just make tons and tons of money off people's

01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:34.880
impulse buys.

01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:35.880
I don't know.

01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:36.880
Kind of crazy.

01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:42.520
Apparently, you can get the demo on your Xbox 360, and you can even get that on the internet.

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:45.260
Just download it right away, and you can get like a little four-minute demo, but here's

01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:46.260
the thing.

01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:51.000
If you want the full version, it's 400 points.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:57.520
Now I'm not going to give this guy a lot of shit because having talked to Aaron on a previous

01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:03.520
show who made Snake 360 and talking to the community developers, I think there's a certain

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:08.720
range of points that they can charge, and so probably 400 is like all this guy can't

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.720
charge.

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.720
I don't know.

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:11.720
I don't know if he can charge less.

01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:12.720
No.

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:13.720
No?

01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:14.720
200.

01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:15.720
I have some for 200.

01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:16.720
Let's see.

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:17.720
Hold on.

01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:18.720
I want to look at some video of this thing in action here.

01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:19.720
Let's see.

01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:22.320
I'm going to actually play a little video.

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:24.160
Yep.

01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:28.000
That is definitely a virtual log.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.480
To be honest, you could probably purchase a DVD for cheaper than five bucks.

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:37.680
Yeah, you could probably go to the 99 Cents store and get one of these DVDs.

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:42.280
The 99 Cents store has some pretty funny movies there.

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:46.720
In fact, that'd be really fun to make stocking stuffers with the 99 Cents clearance center

01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:47.720
movies.

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:48.720
Awesome.

01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:50.160
There's some absolute crap.

01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:51.160
It's awesome.

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.160
That's...

01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:53.520
God, you don't even press a button.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:58.640
It would be awesome if you pressed a button and you could throw a kitten in the fire and

01:59:58.640 --> 01:59:59.640
watch what happens.

01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:00.640
A kitten?

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:01.640
I'm just kidding.

02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:02.640
That's wrong.

02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:03.640
No, I'm kidding.

02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:04.640
It is wrong, but funny.

02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:05.640
A reindeer.

02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:06.640
That's more festive.

02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:07.640
Or Santa.

02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:08.720
You just watch Santa dropping the chimney into the fire.

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:12.060
See, that would be worth 400 points.

02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:14.440
Or Christmas lemmings.

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:17.720
As Dark Tetsuya in Chat says, or a ferret.

02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:19.840
There you go.

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:24.240
Tiger Claw says, there's even an app on the iPhone and iPod touch of a virtual fireplace

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:26.360
for only 99 cents.

02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:28.320
I got a Zippo lighter one for free.

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:35.960
All right, we're going to go to some last minute stories from Loki and then we'll take

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:37.880
some calls on our Skype line.

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:41.880
Well, there's been some new patches for some PC games.

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.280
Darkrai 2 got a patch to fix their widescreen issues.

02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:47.960
Apparently it had the same thing that was wrong with Bioshock with it.

02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:51.360
They were kind of letterboxing it in the reverse, I guess.

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:54.640
But now that's fixed, so yay.

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:58.560
And well, other things.

02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:03.520
Sony is claiming that they're going to get rid of their clamshell packaging.

02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:14.480
They are working to, I guess, go greener and they actually promoted their little announcement

02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:20.240
with a crappy video that's called Sony declares death to the clamshell.

02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:21.680
And it was awful.

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:25.840
And I highly recommend that you don't watch it.

02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:31.160
And other than that, not a whole lot else going on, man.

02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:34.560
It's like, talk about slow going.

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:39.320
Well, it is Christmas week for heaven's sake, but hey, or well, you know, coming up, but

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:43.760
I am so excited about the clamshell news because I think those, that packaging is horrible

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:44.760
evil stuff.

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:48.160
I, oh, oh, grrr.

02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:49.320
Clamshell packaging can go die in a fire.

02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.120
I'm really excited to hear that's, I want to press a button and watch all my old clamshell

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.400
packaging get burned in the fire.

02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:56.200
Cause that annoys me.

02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:01.520
All right, we're taking your calls 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on orange or her username on Skype

02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:02.880
is orange lounge radio.

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:05.080
I've been doing this a little bit too long.

02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.880
Can you believe next week is our last show of 2008 and then we will go into the year

02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.080
2009, which would be our seventh year of podcasting.

02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:17.080
If you could believe it or seventh year of doing this show, I guess podcasting has been

02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.520
around seven years, but you know what I mean?

02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:20.680
Crazy stuff.

02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:22.480
We're getting old.

02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.120
We're getting old next year.

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:26.920
One of us will kill another live on air.

02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:27.920
Just wait for it.

02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:29.880
Stay tuned.

02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:34.800
Would you spend $5 for a yule log game on the 360 where you could throw clamshell packages

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:36.000
into the fire?

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.200
I might.

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:39.400
I just might be willing to spend that kind of money.

02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:42.800
Except you wouldn't because you'd have to use the D pad to do that.

02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:43.800
And yeah.

02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:44.800
All right.

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:47.440
I'm going to the chat or I'm sorry, the phone.

02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:50.120
That's getting late and I haven't even cracked open the eggnog yet.

02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:51.240
Hi, you're on orange lounge radio.

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:52.240
Who's this?

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:54.240
Legend of Zaku.

02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:55.520
Hey, Legend of Zaku.

02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:56.520
What's up?

02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:57.520
Nothing much.

02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:59.360
You know, today's my birthday, right?

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:03.800
Or for the next less than 40 minutes.

02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.880
Well happy Hanukkah and birthday.

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.380
Not Jewish.

02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:10.380
That's all right.

02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:13.720
You don't have to be Jewish to appreciate Hanukkah.

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:14.720
I get gelt.

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:18.280
I love those potato latkes though.

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:19.280
Hell yeah.

02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:20.840
One of my friends was supposed to make me some of those.

02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.480
That sounds delish.

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:27.040
Sorry, the house is turning into Silent Hill here.

02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:31.560
The door just blew open into the house and it's kind of creepy because of all the wind

02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:34.880
blowing outside and the storms.

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:38.880
Maybe in our seventh year of podcasting, Pyramid Head will rape us all live on air.

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:39.880
Yikes.

02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:40.880
Nice.

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:41.880
All right.

02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:42.880
What's on your mind, Zaku?

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.360
Nothing much.

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:48.480
Just trying to scurry up as much money as possible to get me something, at least one

02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:56.640
game for Christmas since the last game I bought was GTA 4 back in May, like April or May.

02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:57.640
It's been a while.

02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:02.680
I mean, I'm unemployed right now, I'm trying to find work and I can't be pissing my money

02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:07.620
away on unnecessary things like that when the bills have to be paid first and foremost.

02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:11.320
I heard that Prince of Persia dropped in price the 40 bucks.

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:12.320
Where at?

02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:13.320
Everywhere.

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:14.320
PC?

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:15.320
What, for PC?

02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:18.320
No, for PS3 and Xbox 360.

02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.680
See, I'm trying to give my PC some love.

02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:26.600
I was going to ask, what one game are you thinking of buying because you must have something

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:27.600
in mind.

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:28.600
Left 4 Dead.

02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:29.600
Left 4 Dead.

02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:30.600
Ah, Left 4 Dead.

02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:31.600
Why Left 4 Dead?

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:40.560
Well, because that's just like playing Half-Life with zombies but with at least subpar storyline

02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:45.120
with it and I get to use my keyboard and mouse.

02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:46.760
Nice.

02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:47.760
Very cool, very cool.

02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.840
I've heard a lot of good things about Left 4 Dead but I think that's another one of those

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:53.680
games that I won't probably actually get to check out until next year just because I'm

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:56.200
playing so much other crap like, wow.

02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:57.200
Yeah.

02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:00.880
Well, I'm sorry to hear about the financial tough times but, you know, it's something

02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:01.880
a lot of people are going through.

02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:02.880
I mean, I have plenty of money saved up.

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:06.480
I'm not worried about, you know, the bills but, you know, I can't burn that money that

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:07.480
quickly.

02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:09.400
That money has to last me until I find work.

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.400
Right.

02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:11.400
No, that's understandable.

02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.400
Mm-hmm.

02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:13.400
So, well.

02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:15.360
Yeah, I mean, I mean, other companies are struggling.

02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:19.840
I mean, you already had like two or, like about two or three companies going under in

02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:20.840
one week.

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:21.840
Six.

02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.800
Six, well, not necessarily going under but doing layoffs.

02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:27.120
Six companies doing some type of closure or cutbacks this week.

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:32.280
I know, I know Factor 5 and I think Free Radical went belly up.

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:34.280
Yeah, we reported on it.

02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:36.400
I don't know if you were here at the very beginning of the show but we kicked off the

02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:37.400
show.

02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:41.760
Factor 5, EA, Midway, Free Radical, Asper and Turbine all did some type of closure or

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:43.800
layoff this week.

02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:46.240
Looks like someone's not having a Christmas party this year.

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:48.160
No, and it sucks.

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:49.320
It's really too bad.

02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:50.320
It's really too bad.

02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:53.520
Well, you used to work in like cell phone games and stuff.

02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:54.520
Yes, I do.

02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:55.520
Are you surprised?

02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:58.760
And then this time last year I had a really nice Christmas party complete with like all

02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:04.080
you can eat stuff, open bar, you know, Guitar Hero, SingStar right there on a big, you know,

02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.920
on a nice big projection.

02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:09.040
Are you surprised by what's happened?

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:11.000
I mean, it's shitty all around.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:17.040
It's like, you know, ask anybody, I bet you know at least 3 or 4 or 5 people that you

02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:20.440
know personally that are probably unemployed right now and are struggling to find work

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:22.760
in this economy.

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:26.880
I mean, I have so many skills right now.

02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:32.480
My experience is that I'm trying my best to secure work but it's a clusterfuck because

02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:34.920
I'm not the only one fighting for that same job.

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:39.700
It's like hundreds upon thousands of other people fighting for that same position, especially

02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:41.280
here in New York.

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.560
It is very, very tough out there right now.

02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:45.560
It's very tough.

02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:50.600
You're lucky you still have work whereas, you know, I had to work as a contractor, you

02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:56.160
know, since early this year since I got laid off from my full-time job.

02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:01.120
And so, you know, I was connected and I had resources but they ran out over the summer.

02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:03.740
Oh no, I'm thankful to have a job.

02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:07.340
You know, I stopped bitching about the promotion I was supposed to get because a while ago

02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:11.920
they were trying to give me a promotion to work and I stopped bitching about it for now

02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:15.080
because I realized that, you know, I should just be lucky to have a job right now so I'm

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:16.080
just going to shut up.

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:17.080
Yeah.

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:21.000
It's better to have a job, you know, better to be working than not be working at all like

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
me right now.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Yeah.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.440
So, well, Zaku, best of luck in your search, maybe for your birthday, somebody will give

02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:28.440
you a new job.

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:32.060
Well, hopefully if you want, you know, I could give you my resume, see what you could do

02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:33.060
with it.

02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:36.840
But then again, I live out, you know, here in New York so it wouldn't make any sense

02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:39.700
if I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm sending it all, I'm

02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:40.700
sending it all.

02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:41.700
Okay.

02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:44.000
Which unfortunately, I don't think I have the money to do right now.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.720
What the crap happened there?

02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:48.220
We got like bad echo and Skype.

02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:49.280
That was awesome.

02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:51.800
I think closed on me.

02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:53.420
That was weird.

02:07:53.420 --> 02:07:54.480
Okay.

02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:55.480
Wow.

02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:57.020
I swear we didn't do any thing.

02:07:57.020 --> 02:07:59.560
What the crap was that?

02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:01.540
Skype just crashed on us in studio.

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:04.500
We got the error message and that happened.

02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:05.500
What the?

02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:06.500
robot

02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:10.380
okay first no dude this is like the beginning of a scary movie right here

02:08:10.380 --> 02:08:12.800
first we had the door blew open

02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:16.680
then we have uh... something happened with zaku on the skype line there

02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.120
what the shit

02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:21.560
i'm scared to take another call let's see what happened

02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:24.520
i don't think it was anything you did zaku sorry about that that's

02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:27.400
but i didn't do anything either that's a weird thing

02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:31.760
this is crazy

02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:35.660
let's take one more call hi uh...

02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:38.740
i saw something come up and i got excited are you going to sleep jamie?

02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:40.180
goodnight jamie

02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:42.580
dark knight is going to sleep

02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:46.380
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:49.340
this is dark knight y'all must had a one miss call moment

02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.700
hi dark knight what's on your mind buddy

02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:55.280
y'all must had a one miss call moment or something when that happened

02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:58.060
uh... it was it's very weird i don't know what the hell's going on with

02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:01.600
skype we'll see maybe i need to upgrade but i thought i just upgraded last week

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:03.620
but whatever what's on your mind buddy

02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:07.500
uh... talking about the layoffs and what not free radical i got

02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:09.180
free radical i can understand

02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:14.100
them shutting their doors and what not cause like i said they had one bus game and whatnot

02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:19.640
it didn't really do much for really make much money for them at all

02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:20.760
and what not

02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:25.220
well yeah i mean you know it's still unfortunate they won't get a chance to

02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:28.320
do a second one you know what i mean that's true

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:32.220
and they said they were working on the time splitter game right

02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:33.220
yeah so

02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:39.760
i mean i can understand that as far as mid weighting them doing layoffs and what not

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.800
that one kind of hard to swallow because i mean

02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:49.260
the latest mortal kombat and what not they've been making their money off of that

02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:52.080
i did see the mortal kombat team was left intact

02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:55.920
mortal kombat team was left intact ok yeah mid weights kind of had a rough year outside of mortal combat

02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:59.080
Mortal Kombat you know we don't really know how the other games is selling yet

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.280
but some of their other high-profile titles did not follow through the way

02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:05.360
they should and to be honest I can't think of a lot of Midway games I've

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:09.840
gotten really excited about this year which is kind of a bummer but you know

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:13.240
yeah I thought I would hear people talk about Blitz but I don't even think I

02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:15.960
heard people was talking about Blitz and everything like that

02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:19.640
no no but then EA I mean EA is kind of you know their year hasn't been that

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.840
terrible yet they did a lot of layoffs too so it's kind of that's and that is a

02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:28.440
big shocker to hear that EA I figured I made comment earlier saying that if one

02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:32.520
of the big comp big game manufacturing companies did have any issues had layoffs

02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:36.840
did we really be scratching our heads if anything else it would be interesting to

02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:43.280
see if Nintendo say or not say a Nintendo Sony or Microsoft gets any

02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.880
brunt of this but I wouldn't think so because Nintendo they don't have a lot

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:50.400
of workforce here you know compared to what they have over in Japan same with

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:54.200
Sony and then Microsoft you know I i you know they're doing pretty well for

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:57.720
themselves and Microsoft and so you know especially companies like Microsoft and

02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:01.180
Sony really have much more than just well then again last week we talked

02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:05.440
about layoffs to Sony didn't we so I guess maybe the Big 3 aren't infallible

02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:06.480
Governments

02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:08.680
entertainment oh thank you

02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:13.220
it's from general the general company I don't think it was for entertainment

02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:16.280
division but at least Microsoft Sony you know they have all those other divisions

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:18.840
their company they're huge huge companies not just about the games still

02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:25.120
right still still and I mean it just and then you think about it then Sega is

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:28.960
like Sega having their bad luck streak with their games and whatnot all the

02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:33.720
Sonic games and whatnot then find out problems with problems with their

02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:39.920
online gaming division and stuff like that I'm like here we go

02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:47.280
If Sega were to go then I'd be a lost sheep

02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:52.880
you know I would cry with you it's just it's not just that but just that all

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:56.120
these companies are getting swallowed up by other companies too you know what I mean

02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:03.320
yeah like um Koei and um Tecmo tried to go over combinations that coming up

02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:10.760
when companies that join forces and whatnot try to save money yikes yikes scary scary

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:13.640
times well Dark Knight anything else on your mind before we let you go tonight

02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:19.840

02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.920
of the year member this is really controversial last year because I ended

up breaking the tie of the whole damn thing and I picked Super Metroid over

02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:43.040
Chrono Trigger and I got so much shit I'm still having to fucking live down

02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:47.560

02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:57.460

02:13:57.460 --> 02:14:02.160
will have to participate in that you can send those emails with your top 25 games

02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:06.240

out of here tonight

02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:35.920
DarkSakura it's sort of weird having to correct my own wiki are you at the OLR

02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:40.240
wiki I am and I just had to actually change something because I said that I

02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:44.360
was I got my name in high school it was actually in college I haven't looked at

02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:49.400
the wiki in a while you know I was looking at it out of you know not a bad

02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:53.880
job though yeah it's all really good I mean it's growing I'm really mine just

02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:59.120
the last time I looked at it mine just said tune into this show to hear about

02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:05.560
Rob's life I thought was funny link to my myspace that's cute cuz I never

02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:11.680
updated anymore I will say this my final thought my final thought is shit cakes

02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:20.760
I think that the different levels and this is a different difficulty so I was

02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:26.320
gonna play him in order but apparently one's like a level five and five-star

02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:30.560
that's kind of hard to get my ass kicked pretty quick I still want to see a

02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:34.760
little more about this game do you have a can't use the video thing that I tried

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:38.600
that later cuz I there was an update that they allowed like PlayStation

02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:42.480
Network software to do to be able to output but it's only a classic

02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:47.160
PlayStation games and that sucks that's bullshit

02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:50.240
