Merry Christmas

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
It's too late for that

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
It's a preemptive one for 2009

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It's still Kwanzaa

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
It's true

Merry Kwanzaa

My name is Rob Roberts

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Joining us as always, say hello to the one and only

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm sad, Rob

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Why are you sad?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
It's the last show of the year

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I know, it's the last show ever

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
And my nap got disturbed

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
How did your nap get disturbed?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I was napping and suddenly it was showtime

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Thanks

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Hit the ground running tonight

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
The show before us, Bobby, you know we love Bobby

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
He was running a little long tonight

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Because he had a bunch of guests on

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
They were doing 2008 reviews

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
We were just kind of chilling

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
And it kept going and going

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
So we were like, let's take a cat nap

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
But then our chat room was getting restless

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
As they might say overseas

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Rude

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
A little bit rude

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
But it's all good

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
It's handy

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
So anyhow

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
We're going to get the show started

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Talk about the latest in gaming this week

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
And some of the highlights of 2008

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
And gaming, we have listless tonight

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
What about Loki?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Ah, fuck Loki

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
No, I'm just kidding

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Everybody say hello to Techmaster Loki

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I don't want to talk to you anyways

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm sure he'd make his presence known at some point anyway

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I haven't gone into the gaming weeks yet

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
But he still learned hello

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
And if you haven't gone into the gaming weeks

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And still forgot Loki

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Then you could yell at me

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Rob, don't you know that the first rule of parenting

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Is maintain a schedule in order

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Am I your daddy?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Oh baby

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Also say hello to the one and only

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Arcadian42 is joining us tonight

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Straight from the ultra-sensitive mics

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes, the ultra-sensitive mics

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Wanted to come and bother you for a show

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
No, please do

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You know, it was funny

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I had a bunch of people sending me private messages

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Before the show began tonight

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Do you have anyone coming? Do you have anyone coming tonight?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
And I was like, no

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm like, aren't the three of us good enough?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Well, I didn't know you were coming

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
And then you showed up and I'm like, oh good

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
This will appease those people that were thinking

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
We'd have some big, festive, year-end special

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
When in reality, most people that usually come on the show

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Are out of town

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
And of course, prepare to be disappointed

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
When I don't say too much

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
I haven't played any of the most, almost none of the games this year

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
You know what, you'll just have to make your presence known tonight

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And when in doubt, just do what

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Rice Princess does and just fart in the mic

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Okay, there you go

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
We've decided, though, what your special power is

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
The ability to show up at any party

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
And still be there

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Playing pinball

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Just sit in a corner and you

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Don't notice me until

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
No, it's like

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
And we have no problem with this

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
We just think it's funny

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Dan and I were talking about last time you were at one of our parties

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And we were just wandering around the house

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And people were starting to head off

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And nothing's going on in the garage

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
At least so we think

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
We go into the garage and there he is

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Playing

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
You're turning the light out

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
And you hear this voice

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I was about to

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
And all of a sudden

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I hear sound effects

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
From what machines do we have in there right now

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Indiana Jones

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
No, we were fixing that one

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
But I was just hearing sound effects

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I was like, what the crap? Oh, hi

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I have nowhere to go

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
No, we thought it was funny

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
So that's your mutant power

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And if you hear crackles tonight

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
In the sound, it's not your guys' iPods

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Or speakers or what have you

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
One of our mics is strange tonight

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And Bradley

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
This is the most you've ever talked

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Like ever

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
This is a special day

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
God bless us, everyone

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm just saying

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Okay, Tiny Rob

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Alright, let's go to

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Hey, it's not the side, this is how you use it

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Let's get into your gaming week

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
It was semi-eventful

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I played stuff

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I started Ragnarok Online DS

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
And I was like

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Ooh, Ragnarok

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Talking and talking and talking and talking

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And talking and talking and talking

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Wow, I read like a Japanese five-year-old

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Talking and talking and talking and talking

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And talking

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Finally, action!

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
We're gonna fall off a cliff

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Shit, we landed on this guy

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Let's talk to him

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Well, it's a novice at these graves

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Which I'm guessing are his parents or some shit

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
But he goes and hears the thump

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And it's this girl from

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Who's one of the shaman class that was made for the game

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And so he's like talking to her

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
She's all up in his face

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Bump, bumping him back and everything

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
He's like, what are you doing hitting him with your boobs?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
So it was like

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Talk to me!

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I forgot his name

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
But I was like, text in blue

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I can read it

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And it was named one of the towns

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I was like, okay, good

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
All the towns are gonna be written in katakana

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
And I can read that shit

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
And it was

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It actually, when it goes through big dialogue scenes

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It has you saved periodically

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
So I've saved

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
And I've done my stats too

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
So I at least

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Remember that all my stats are in the same place

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Because I recognize the kanji for strength

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And so I was like, well, strength is always the first one

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
So maybe the next one is agility

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
And the next one is intelligence

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
And blah blah blah blah

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Okay, but besides the talking, does it play like the online one?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I haven't gotten that far

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I'm just talking right now

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So I was like, well, I should go to bed

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So I did

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
And I tried to go back and play some more Order of Ecclesia and I still suck

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, because I just need one more level worth of life bar and I'll be okay

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Because I was like, right toward the end of the forest

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Stupid freaking forest!

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
It's like worse than Simon's Quest

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
What a horrible night for a curse

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
And so

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Anyway, so anyway

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I also

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I went with my friend Becky

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And we got her husband an Xbox

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Well, she did that technically

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
She got the family their Christmas present of an Xbox 360

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And she gave him

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
A big fat gift certificate to GameStop

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
And I was like

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Well, if you were gonna actually pick out games for him

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You should get him

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Fallout 3

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And Fable 2

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And the Orange Box

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
All of them

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Awesome

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Hell yeah

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
So anyway, so I actually got to see some of

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Fallout 3 and I thought it was pretty cool

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I didn't play any because those games make me freaking

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Nauseated as hell

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Did you get to hit the button that makes the baby talk?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I haven't really played Fallout 3 yet

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
But I was listening to Bobby talk about it on the last show

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
When they were talking about the

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I don't remember what it was, but he was talking about slamming on the button

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
That makes the baby talk and I'm like, wow, that sounds kind of awesome

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
That could be the best game ever

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And I played some Animal Crossing

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
So that I could harass Jingle

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Who I think is on crack

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh shit, I forgot about Holidays and Animal Crossing

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Because he has the starry eyes

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And I think that it really means that Jingle is on crack

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
So he won't sleep at all that night

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
So it's like, here's your presents

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Kids

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
And, and, and, and

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I downloaded something on my phone

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
What's that?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, two things. First of all was the

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
8,000 cocktail drink mixing guide

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
For free

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Hey, we're having our

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
New Year's party at Julie's house

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
And I need to be drunk

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Because it's Julie's house

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Sorry

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
No offense to Julie if you listen

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Intoxicated enough to play

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
To actually sing karaoke

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
We will have a special guest

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Who will be here for this party

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Namely, Sauce

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Oh, is she coming to town?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
No, she's actually going to teleport in

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
And show up just for five seconds

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
That night and leave

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Yes, she's coming

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Alright, I think I'll see you at Gaming Week

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Before I smack you

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I did play other stuff, I played Rhino Rock Online

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
The real thing

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
The real one for free

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And someone gave me a mistress card

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
For Christmas

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And I was like, ooh, a mistress card

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Is that like a business card?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Like if you ever need a mistress to be called?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
A stupid bee

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
That I hate

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
She's one of the MVP things

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And then you get a card

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
That makes you not have to use gems

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
To cast stuff

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Which is helpful and useful

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Only I forgot to put it in something

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
So I got that

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
And

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I played with the City of Heroes character creator

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
A lot, the Korean one

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I hear it's the best part of the game

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
That's why I have the Korean character creators

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I haven't played the whole game yet

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm thinking about playing it

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Because I was really thinking about it

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I was like, dude, why would I even remotely

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Want to play World of Warcraft again?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Because I was just looking at

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Different stuff going on

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I was like, dude, I don't want to play that anymore

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
So I'm kind of waffling again

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
So that's really it

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
For my Gaming Week

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Let me read some chat comments

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
You can always join our chat room

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Chat.orangelaundry.com

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
GS68 comments on

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Both you and I have said

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Things about the level of difficulty in the

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And I don't know if it's just because we suck at games

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Now that we've gotten older

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Or the game really is kind of a step harder

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
But GS68's thoughts is

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
At least Ecclesia is think on your feet hard

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Not stupid hard like Circle of the Moon

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, well, this is what I've noticed

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I've actually got pretty good

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Reaction time through the

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Through the forest

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I sped through the first level

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I really just sped through it

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And I think that

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I would probably

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Do better with about another level's worth of life

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And then I can get through it

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Because it's like

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
This one place that I always end up

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Getting smacked around at

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Since you didn't get your time gaining experience points

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
So

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
So I'm going to go back and

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And we have an offer from Xenocore in chat

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Who's on the justice server in City of Heroes

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, thank you kindly, sir

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
It was okay

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I played more

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Dissidef

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Or Dissidia

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Of the new Final Fantasy

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I don't even know who you want to call the fighting game

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
To me, it's very similar to

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Crisis Core a bit

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Because Crisis Core, if you've ever played it

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Is pretty much all battles

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I mean, there's a little bit of

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Kind of dialogue

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And little plain stuff

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
In between, but you have kind of

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Your main base that you

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Do all your purchasing of items and stuff like that

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
But Dissidia is all

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Fighting

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And you can purchase items actually

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Through your status screens

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Stuff like that

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Which I finally figured out how to do

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Because I was like, well what the hell am I getting Gil for?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I can't use this for anything

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And I'm like, oh, there's a store

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Oh, there's better weapons

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Why I'm not doing any damage to these people

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
So

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
It's been okay

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It's kind of a lot of grinding

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Because right now I'm just leveling up Cloud

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
But

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I don't know, it's still fun

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I wish I could understand some of the story that's going along

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
But to be honest, it doesn't

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Really seem like I'm missing a whole lot

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
So, eh

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And then

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I went ahead and

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Fired up my Playstation 3

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I tried out Home

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
It's okay, I guess

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I was kind of bored with it

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I tried making a character look like myself

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And then that didn't work, so the next best thing

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Was I made a creepy Santa Claus

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And I had to

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You know, first I was just trying to find

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Clothes that looked like the Santa Claus clothes

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And then I realized that they actually sold the Santa Claus

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Clothes, so I had to buy those

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And so now

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Wait, wait, wait, stop

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Hold on, you bought something

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
In Home? Yeah

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Get off the show

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I am laughing you off

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Of this program

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
You spent money on that

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
That's it

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
That's all I spent money on

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
But yeah, I didn't even end up buying the club

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Remember how I talked about how I wanted to buy the OLR club

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Well, turns out I could go in and buy it

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And after I was reading more about it, I'm like, this sounds stupid

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
There's no point for it yet

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
But, you know

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Basically I bought stuff on there

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Just to see how easy it was

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And it actually is pretty easy

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
The items are pretty cheap

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
At least the clothes were only like 50 cents each

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And the thing about it is

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I had knocked the PlayStation Network before

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Because I hated the way you put money on your account

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And you have to spend so much

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Actually, I found out

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
If you have

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
If you are buying items that are under

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
$5

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Then yes, you can only put in

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
The minimum of $5 on your account

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
If you're purchasing stuff over $5

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
In total

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
What will happen is

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Say if you have less than $5 in credit left

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
It will only charge you

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
You can have the option just to

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Import the exact amount into your account

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Which is something I wish Microsoft

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Would totally do with Xbox Live

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Because that would be awesome

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
None of this

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
20 points just sitting there for no reason

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
You can actually just do the exact amount

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Which is sweet

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
So yeah, I played around with home

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
For a little bit

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And it was a complete waste of time

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I don't get

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
What the purpose of all this is

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
But at least you look like Santa Claus

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
So hooray for that

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Yes, at least I look like Santa Claus

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Big deal

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I'm going to still wear the Santa Claus costume forever

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I'm not buying any more clothes

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
That's it, I'm Santa Claus forever now

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Even in June

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
That's fun

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
So yeah, it was quite boring

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And the loading is annoying

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I gotta say

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Some comments from chat because they're too good

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Hanukkah Harry in chat says

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
What the fuck Loki, you might as well buy Eye of Judgment

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
No, I'm not buying Eye of Judgment

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Trishlicious in chat says

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I wish I had a Playstation 3 then I could be exploring home now

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Honestly, Trish

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I used to feel that same way

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Like 6 months ago

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
You're not missing much, honestly

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I think home is going to be a lot better in a year

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
But that'll be a year

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I do have to give them credit though

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
The video integration in it

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Like the actual little video screens and stuff

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
That's actually pretty cool

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And it's pretty seamless

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
But at the same time it's kind of annoying

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And it's also annoying how much

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Stuff is being censored in there

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Like everything is being censored

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
And it's really annoying

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Ok, so enough with home

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
The other thing I downloaded on the Playstation Network this week

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Was the new Metal Gear Solid pack

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
For LittleBigPlanet

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And holy crap does that change the game

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It really, first of all

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
The pack itself contains like

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
5 levels and I think a challenge level

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And they're great levels

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I mean it's the same kind of quality

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
As the in-game story levels

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
They're awesome

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I like it though because the whole premise of the levels

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Is that you're basically

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Going to try to stop

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Liquid's

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Device for creating trophy levels

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
It's a machine that creates trophy levels

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Genius, pure genius

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I love the way that Media Molecule

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Played on some of the current controversies

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
The only thing that would have been even better

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Was a joke about moderation

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Somehow

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
But I love that they actually made fun of the whole trophy whoring levels

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
That was great

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
But the actual

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Like the new weapon, the paininator in it

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Awesome, it really

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It's going to open it up to a whole bunch of new

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Types of levels

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Which is great

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
And from what I actually watched the podcast they did on

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Kotaku

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
They were talking about what their plans are

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
For LittleBigPlanet and they were asked about LittleBigPlanet 2

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And they said

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
They have no plans on making LittleBigPlanet 2

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
As long as they can keep adding to LittleBigPlanet 1

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
They're going to keep doing that

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
That's all they're working on

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Unless they hit a roadblock

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Unless they really want to add

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
That they can't do in LittleBigPlanet

17:10.000 --> 17:13.560
But for right now, they're just going to keep doing download packs because they're selling

17:13.560 --> 17:15.060
really well.

17:15.060 --> 17:16.220
So that's kind of cool.

17:16.220 --> 17:21.280
Now just to clarify though, you don't have to buy this Metal Gear Solid add-on to get

17:21.280 --> 17:24.500
to use the Paintinator because it'll show up in other people's levels, right?

17:24.500 --> 17:25.500
Yes, that's right.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.500
That's kind of neat.

17:26.500 --> 17:30.820
Yeah, but if you want to add it to your own levels, then you have to buy it.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.140
Honestly, you should buy it anyways because it's awesome.

17:33.140 --> 17:37.660
I actually bought the Metal Gear Solid pack to the little costumes because I had to dress

17:37.660 --> 17:41.200
up like, I think, Raiden in there or something.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.200
It's cool now.

17:42.200 --> 17:46.420
So I'm doing that instead of my weird ninja cape guy.

17:46.420 --> 17:50.340
But yeah, I was playing some more of the levels on there.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.100
They're really cool.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.100
The Paintinator's fun.

17:53.100 --> 17:57.300
And just someone actually made a level that was like a tank that had three different weapons

17:57.300 --> 18:00.380
and stuff on there and that was kind of neat.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.860
And just some of the stuff that they do in the Metal Gear Solid levels are just amazing.

18:03.860 --> 18:08.340
They actually have one level that you have to sneak and avoid these spotlights because

18:08.340 --> 18:13.700
if not, then you die because all these explosions come.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.700
And then just, you know, the last boss in the game, it's awesome.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.580
It really is an awesome set of levels and I really hope they keep releasing stuff like

18:21.580 --> 18:25.100
this because they're really cool.

18:25.100 --> 18:30.700
And then, of course, you know, the usual stuff, you know, more Grand Theft Auto IV, both on

18:30.700 --> 18:39.140
PC and on the 360 and yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.140
Alright.

18:40.140 --> 18:44.060
Arkadian42, Bradley Surd, the chatty one tonight.

18:44.060 --> 18:47.540
I saw you haul a DS in here and you were kind of playing DS while we had a little bit of

18:47.540 --> 18:49.460
downtime a little bit ago.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.020
What kind of games have you been playing this week?

18:51.020 --> 18:54.900
Alright, most of this week I was not playing anything because I was at home on the other

18:54.900 --> 18:57.380
coast doing Christmas stuff.

18:57.380 --> 19:00.220
But what I've been playing recently is My Japanese Coach.

19:00.220 --> 19:01.220
Wait, wait.

19:01.220 --> 19:02.220
Where is home?

19:02.220 --> 19:04.220
Because we might have some listeners there that want to go, whoo!

19:04.220 --> 19:05.220
Greenville, South Carolina.

19:05.220 --> 19:06.220
Whoo!

19:06.220 --> 19:07.220
Alright.

19:07.220 --> 19:08.220
Long way away.

19:08.220 --> 19:09.220
Yes.

19:09.220 --> 19:13.940
In front of the airport yesterday because my first flight was overweight so it drove

19:13.940 --> 19:17.220
five of us down to Atlanta for the second flight.

19:17.220 --> 19:18.220
Oh wow.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.220
Yeah, it was a fun time.

19:20.220 --> 19:21.220
Interesting.

19:21.220 --> 19:25.260
Yeah, they were carrying extra fuel because there was like fog or something in Atlanta

19:25.260 --> 19:30.900
so just in case it couldn't land at the time and had to fly around for half an hour or

19:30.900 --> 19:31.900
something.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.580
So you got lots of DS time in during all this travel debacle.

19:34.580 --> 19:38.940
Well, actually I was listening in because there was a British couple who lived in the

19:38.940 --> 19:44.260
area and they were going back to England for a week for someone's funeral or something.

19:44.260 --> 19:47.540
It was kind of fun to listen to them.

19:47.540 --> 19:49.100
But anyway, the one I was playing...

19:49.100 --> 19:53.420
Sorry, I told me to laugh but I'm just trying to picture what must have been so fascinating

19:53.420 --> 19:55.580
about this conversation.

19:55.580 --> 19:56.580
Never mind.

19:56.580 --> 19:57.580
Another show.

19:57.580 --> 19:58.580
My Japanese coach.

19:58.580 --> 19:59.580
Okay.

19:59.580 --> 20:04.260
Well, I'm basically reviewing what I've learned before for the most part and learning a little

20:04.260 --> 20:07.260
bit enough to get through that.

20:07.260 --> 20:13.340
And it's actually pretty good for learning new stuff and I think there's maybe the only

20:13.340 --> 20:18.820
limitation if you're like a newer user would be or a newer person learning Japanese would

20:18.820 --> 20:24.260
be that it kind of glosses a little bit over the learning sentences and so on, but it's

20:24.260 --> 20:27.420
good on repetition of words and so on.

20:27.420 --> 20:33.300
Which is if you're just reviewing the first 30 or 40 lessons, it's a little bit tedious

20:33.300 --> 20:38.580
because it takes a while because you have to repeat games and stuff to get to the next

20:38.580 --> 20:39.580
lesson.

20:39.580 --> 20:40.780
Do you actually have to talk into it?

20:40.780 --> 20:43.040
No, you don't have to talk.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.020
There is a thing you can actually compare.

20:46.020 --> 20:49.740
You can speak into the mic and then it'll repeat it back and you can kind of compare

20:49.740 --> 20:55.080
it to actually the actual Japanese speaker that's in the game so that you can learn that

20:55.080 --> 20:56.080
stuff.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.080
That sounds neat.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.940
Do you think somebody like me who doesn't know a lick of Japanese yet tries to pronounce

20:59.940 --> 21:02.820
the Japanese release dates here on Orange Launch Radio and gets teased for it every

21:02.820 --> 21:06.740
other week, do you think I might have some benefit to play this game?

21:06.740 --> 21:08.380
Yeah, it would be pretty good.

21:08.380 --> 21:09.380
I might have to check it out.

21:09.380 --> 21:13.580
Yeah, and then you can learn the hiragana and katakana and of course it takes a long

21:13.580 --> 21:16.780
time because it's not until less than 40 or something.

21:16.780 --> 21:20.020
Although Jamie did admit a few weeks ago, I've gotten better in the years I've been

21:20.020 --> 21:21.020
doing it.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.020
You have gotten quite a bit better.

21:22.020 --> 21:24.700
I've gotten better, so when in doubt, crash and burn your way through it.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.700
Arigato.

21:25.700 --> 21:31.820
Yeah, because basically when I've been listening to the podcast, trying to catch up, I'm still

21:31.820 --> 21:32.820
like 30 behind.

21:32.820 --> 21:33.820
I'm actually thinking about getting that, though.

21:33.820 --> 21:35.740
Oh man, come on, you can say that better.

21:35.740 --> 21:36.740
With the Japanese coach?

21:36.740 --> 21:37.740
Yeah.

21:37.740 --> 21:38.740
Yeah?

21:38.740 --> 21:41.820
Because I have a couple of friends that live in Japan that I want to visit, but I also

21:41.820 --> 21:45.660
have people I know in England that I want to visit, so I have to think.

21:45.660 --> 21:49.380
See if I really wanted to learn Japanese, what I would do is get Jamie a device where

21:49.380 --> 21:53.340
every time I mispronounce a word, she shocks me, but the problem is that she would use

21:53.340 --> 21:56.780
that device for things other than its intended purpose, so I don't allow her to have this

21:56.780 --> 21:57.780
device.

21:57.780 --> 21:59.980
Hanukkah Harry said I was a scroll.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.740
I'm not a scroll.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.100
That probably finishes gaming week.

22:03.100 --> 22:09.500
Okay, I'll go a little bit farther than this week because other than this, since it's been

22:09.500 --> 22:15.020
a while since I've been here, the other things I've been playing is Castlevania Lament of

22:15.020 --> 22:19.300
Innocence, which, even though I heard people saying it was bad or something, it's actually

22:19.300 --> 22:20.700
a pretty good game.

22:20.700 --> 22:24.360
Other than the camera issues, which you can't see half the time because it's looking in

22:24.360 --> 22:28.660
the other direction from the actual degree of movement, it's actually pretty enjoyable

22:28.660 --> 22:36.260
and the voice acting is really good, and the other thing was Zelda Phantom Hourglass, which

22:36.260 --> 22:41.220
I've still got a ways to go, and that's a fun game.

22:41.220 --> 22:46.100
Alright, reading some other comments in chatroom, Akuma JP says, commenting on my reading of

22:46.100 --> 22:49.820
the Japanese release dates, Sky sometimes gets very good when he is in a good mood,

22:49.820 --> 22:54.380
but no idea when he is not in the mood, so apparently if I'm in a good mood, I'll do

22:54.380 --> 22:58.540
better at reading the release dates, so I'll try to smile before I read the dates tonight

22:58.540 --> 23:01.340
so I'm in a good mood, although I don't think we have a lot this week.

23:01.340 --> 23:06.740
Alright, my gaming week, real quickly, because pretty much everything I wanted to talk about

23:06.740 --> 23:09.340
has already been talked about.

23:09.340 --> 23:12.580
I have been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King, as you know, I'm addicted

23:12.580 --> 23:16.860
to MMOs, but I would like to congratulate our guild for clearing Nax, that was pretty

23:16.860 --> 23:21.220
awesome, which is one of the big raids at the end, we cleared 10-man Nax this week,

23:21.220 --> 23:27.780
which is nice, and the other thing I've been playing is the Metal Gear Solid expansion

23:27.780 --> 23:32.900
on LittleBigPlanet, which is amazing, and everybody should buy it, because not only

23:32.900 --> 23:36.620
does it come with the whole gun and things you can put in your own levels, I don't even

23:36.620 --> 23:41.180
design levels, but I just kind of wanted to see, my thought was, is that, hmm, probably

23:41.180 --> 23:46.100
Media Molecule designed some levels to unlock this stuff in, because I heard that you actually

23:46.100 --> 23:49.500
had to play these levels to unlock the stuff, so you're basically getting, you know what,

23:49.500 --> 23:53.780
five or so new Media Molecule levels, and they are great!

23:53.780 --> 23:56.920
And I realized I could go online and download a ton of other levels, but there's something

23:56.920 --> 24:01.100
about having the official developer with official unlocks, being able to play those levels,

24:01.100 --> 24:03.300
and they are fantastic.

24:03.300 --> 24:06.900
Something Loki kind of neglected to mention is that not only can you run through them

24:06.900 --> 24:10.620
once, but you can go back and you can play through these same levels again with new challenge

24:10.620 --> 24:13.980
elements on them, you'll get stickers at the very end that you can go back and place at

24:13.980 --> 24:17.300
the very beginning, and then suddenly the entire level becomes a race, which makes some

24:17.300 --> 24:20.360
of those things like the stealth level and stuff become very interesting, because you're

24:20.360 --> 24:22.100
trying to rush, but not too much.

24:22.100 --> 24:25.520
I've actually gotten most of the trophies for the entire thing, in fact, I think I have

24:25.520 --> 24:29.700
all the trophies except for the one beating the last boss under a certain time limit,

24:29.700 --> 24:31.740
but I have all the other trophies, because I've gone through-

24:31.740 --> 24:33.780
I don't think I've unlocked a single trophy yet, sadly.

24:33.780 --> 24:40.240
Because I've gone through, I've aced all the levels, I've gotten every single bit of collectible

24:40.240 --> 24:43.400
stuff in the game, or at least in those levels.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.620
I'm missing like two stickers in one level that is bugging the hell out of me because

24:46.620 --> 24:47.620
I can't figure out where they are.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.100
I know what you're talking about, you're talking about the third level, and it took me-

24:49.100 --> 24:50.100
Yes, it is!

24:50.100 --> 24:51.100
How do you know?

24:51.100 --> 24:52.800
Where are they?

24:52.800 --> 24:53.800
You tell me now!

24:53.800 --> 24:54.820
Alright, I'll tell you now.

24:54.820 --> 24:59.340
You know that spot where you have to shoot the green thing so the platforms lower down?

24:59.340 --> 25:00.340
Yeah.

25:00.340 --> 25:04.180
On the second one that lowers down, you walk through to the left, and there's a hallway

25:04.180 --> 25:05.180
that you can walk through.

25:05.180 --> 25:06.180
Oh, shut up.

25:06.180 --> 25:07.180
Really?

25:07.180 --> 25:08.180
Yeah, it took me forever to figure that out.

25:08.180 --> 25:12.220
That is so crazy, I didn't even have to tell you what it is that's frustrating me, and

25:12.220 --> 25:14.740
I know exactly what you're talking about, I'm like, nope, I haven't been there.

25:14.740 --> 25:15.740
You're right, that's what I'm missing.

25:15.740 --> 25:19.420
Yeah, because I had to read the comments for the actual level, and there was questions

25:19.420 --> 25:23.020
about that in there, and that's where they said it was.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.860
I knew, just playing the level, I'm like, there's something down there, I just don't

25:25.860 --> 25:26.860
know how to get down there.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.980
The network was down the day I was trying to play, so I couldn't do that.

25:29.980 --> 25:30.980
Interesting.

25:30.980 --> 25:34.860
But I gotta say, honestly, if you have LittleBigPlanet, check out the expansion, you won't be disappointed.

25:34.860 --> 25:39.300
Even if you don't build levels, I think the five or so levels that come with it are, it's

25:39.300 --> 25:40.300
six bucks.

25:40.300 --> 25:41.300
It's worth it.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.300
It really is.

25:42.300 --> 25:46.540
Okay, let's move on with tonight's show, and try to get into some gaming news.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.560
But first, some housekeeping tonight.

25:48.560 --> 25:52.540
First off, we want to make sure everybody had a really wonderful holiday, and just a

25:52.540 --> 25:56.340
quick reminder, although we didn't take off any shows for the holiday, we will not be

25:56.340 --> 26:04.580
here January 11th, I believe is the day, yeah, January 11th, we will not be here, so no yelling

26:04.580 --> 26:05.820
at Bobby if he goes long.

26:05.820 --> 26:06.820
January 11th.

26:06.820 --> 26:12.300
He can go to midnight if he wants, I don't really care, so be nice.

26:12.300 --> 26:15.460
But yeah, no, we're not going to be here January 11th at all.

26:15.460 --> 26:18.660
And just out of curiosity, something else I want to ask during housekeeping tonight,

26:18.660 --> 26:21.380
did you all get any gaming loot for Christmas?

26:21.380 --> 26:24.160
I didn't really get anything, but did you guys get any gaming loot for Christmas?

26:24.160 --> 26:25.540
I got two things from Dan.

26:25.540 --> 26:31.380
Well, keep in mind, we bought each other new computers, so we easily spent a couple grand

26:31.380 --> 26:34.140
on each, you know, together for our presents.

26:34.140 --> 26:40.700
But he did get me the Animal Crossing Strategy Guide, so I know what all the Toto KK songs

26:40.700 --> 26:42.460
are called now.

26:42.460 --> 26:49.000
And he got me these Kingdom Hearts promo cards that they had at his store, and I kind of

26:49.000 --> 26:54.180
wanted them, so he grabbed me some, and I got the Silent Hill Homecoming soundtrack,

26:54.180 --> 27:00.460
which a lucky person is going to be receiving a copy as well, but I won't say anything more

27:00.460 --> 27:03.460
than that.

27:03.460 --> 27:06.180
Ooh.

27:06.180 --> 27:08.980
And candy.

27:08.980 --> 27:11.340
And I got a coat.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.780
I have a funny story about my coat.

27:12.780 --> 27:14.820
You remember the coat I was wearing last week?

27:14.820 --> 27:16.860
Yes, I do.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.740
Well, Becky and I were going shopping.

27:19.740 --> 27:20.740
Did someone knock on the...

27:20.740 --> 27:21.740
No.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.740
No.

27:22.740 --> 27:26.220
We were going shopping, and we saw these coats at this one retailer, who I will not

27:26.220 --> 27:29.100
mention, and we thought they were cute, so we went in, and it was like marked down from

27:29.100 --> 27:33.820
$89 to $39, and they were probably going to get one half price.

27:33.820 --> 27:37.220
So we just gifted each other coats, and they were really cool.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.220
Nice.

27:38.220 --> 27:39.220
And super cute, but I'm not wearing it today.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.220
Um...

27:40.220 --> 27:42.220
Surprisingly, the studio's not nearly as cold as it has been in previous weeks.

27:42.220 --> 27:43.220
Dude, it's not.

27:43.220 --> 27:45.100
I was thinking I was going to freeze or some shit.

27:45.100 --> 27:46.100
Yeah, it's been kind of nice.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.940
I don't know what the difference is today, but I'm not going to complain.

27:48.940 --> 27:53.540
And of course, I got a Ragnarok Online DS from Loki.

27:53.540 --> 27:55.620
Aw, Loki.

27:55.620 --> 27:56.620
You're the best.

27:56.620 --> 27:57.620
Hey, no problem.

27:57.620 --> 27:58.620
All right.

27:58.620 --> 27:59.620
One other thing...

27:59.620 --> 28:00.620
Oh.

28:00.620 --> 28:01.620
Oh, yeah?

28:01.620 --> 28:02.620
I got Knights on Wii.

28:02.620 --> 28:03.620
Oh, how's that?

28:03.620 --> 28:04.620
Haven't opened it yet.

28:04.620 --> 28:09.200
I didn't get any games or anything, but Rama did send me this shirt that says Companion

28:09.200 --> 28:13.740
Cube is my co-pilot, so thank you very much to Rama, who sent me that shirt, which I think

28:13.740 --> 28:14.740
is great.

28:14.740 --> 28:15.740
It's very cute.

28:15.740 --> 28:17.380
This is something you cannot have.

28:17.380 --> 28:20.780
And I'm being very scummy because I wore it yesterday, too, and I'm doing that really

28:20.780 --> 28:24.300
gross thing where I wore the same shirt two days in a row because I was lazy today.

28:24.300 --> 28:27.300
I didn't really leave the house, so whatevs.

28:27.300 --> 28:28.300
Come on.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.300
You've all been there, too.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.560
Admit it.

28:30.560 --> 28:36.300
I do want to work in a plug for Bobby because our listeners chased him off the air tonight,

28:36.300 --> 28:40.740
so the least I can do is give him a plug for his new project, which is actually going to

28:40.740 --> 28:41.740
be pretty awesome.

28:41.740 --> 28:43.540
And if I was in Atlanta, I would go.

28:43.540 --> 28:45.420
Sadly, I'm not.

28:45.420 --> 28:51.380
Sadly I might be, and I would make it a point on Friday night to go check out fnglive.net.

28:51.380 --> 28:53.940
It's a new program that starts January 9th.

28:53.940 --> 28:54.940
That's the same weekend.

28:54.940 --> 28:58.460
We're not going to be here, sadly, but it all starts January 9th, and they are taping

28:58.460 --> 29:03.980
live at a computer arena in Atlanta, and there's going to be other people on, and they're going

29:03.980 --> 29:07.780
to actually dissect game consoles and repair them live on air, and it's actually kind of

29:07.780 --> 29:08.780
a multimedia thing.

29:08.780 --> 29:09.780
It's not just a radio.

29:09.780 --> 29:12.140
They're doing TV, too, so it sounds pretty exciting.

29:12.140 --> 29:13.920
I just sent them my broken 360.

29:13.920 --> 29:14.920
Good luck fixing that one.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.460
Yeah, I think you have to take a number for that, because I think they already have lined

29:17.460 --> 29:19.420
up what they're doing for the first two shows, but...

29:19.420 --> 29:20.780
No, I don't want it back.

29:20.780 --> 29:21.780
They can just...

29:21.780 --> 29:22.780
They just have it?

29:22.780 --> 29:23.780
Yeah.

29:23.780 --> 29:24.780
I don't know.

29:24.780 --> 29:25.780
Maybe they take it.

29:25.780 --> 29:26.780
I don't know.

29:26.780 --> 29:27.780
You'll have to talk to Bobby.

29:27.780 --> 29:28.780
All right.

29:28.780 --> 29:29.780
So check that out.

29:29.780 --> 29:32.100
Again, fnglive.net, and they start January 9th right here on All Games Radio is where

29:32.100 --> 29:36.300
you can hear the feed, so if you're not in Atlanta and you can't go check it out in person,

29:36.300 --> 29:39.220
if you're in California, New York, Canada, wherever else you might be, you can check

29:39.220 --> 29:40.940
it out on the internets.

29:40.940 --> 29:41.940
Let's get into some gaming news.

29:41.940 --> 29:43.380
Yes, we do have gaming news this week.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.380
It's very odd.

29:44.380 --> 29:47.900
We spend this week kind of reflecting on the year 2008, and we will do a little bit of

29:47.900 --> 29:49.260
that later.

29:49.260 --> 29:54.500
However, we need to talk about some news, because there's actually been some big news

29:54.500 --> 29:55.500
this week.

29:55.500 --> 29:59.580
Yeah, unfortunately it's not for our region, though, but Japan...

29:59.580 --> 30:00.580
What happens in Japan?

30:00.580 --> 30:01.580
Might happen here, right?

30:01.580 --> 30:02.580
Still more.

30:02.580 --> 30:04.340
Yeah, not so much, I don't think.

30:04.340 --> 30:08.900
Basically, you know, Japan, they do a lot of things over there, especially with their

30:08.900 --> 30:14.420
WiiWare service and Nintendo and that kind of stuff, that we will probably never see

30:14.420 --> 30:15.900
over here.

30:15.900 --> 30:19.940
For example, you know, they got a while back a...

30:19.940 --> 30:25.740
I don't know if it was a couple WiiWare downloads, but they have a new, like, manga comics that

30:25.740 --> 30:29.700
you can actually download on the service, which is kind of neat.

30:29.700 --> 30:34.020
Plus, you know, they had their Nintendo channel for a while before we did.

30:34.020 --> 30:37.700
Well, they're getting another channel, and it's not too surprising, since the other two

30:37.700 --> 30:39.920
consoles also have one similar.

30:39.920 --> 30:45.700
It's a new video streaming service that will be available.

30:45.700 --> 30:59.660
Now, this is actually in conjunction with Densetsu, and it's basically not your typical,

30:59.660 --> 31:04.300
you know, video download service, because they're not going to have movies, they're

31:04.300 --> 31:06.920
not going to really have a lot of TV shows and stuff.

31:06.920 --> 31:07.920
What they're going to have, though, is...

31:07.920 --> 31:08.920
Oh my God!

31:08.920 --> 31:10.380
Is it what I've always been waiting for?

31:10.380 --> 31:11.620
A porno on-demand service?

31:11.620 --> 31:13.660
No, it's not a porno on-demand service.

31:13.660 --> 31:17.040
It's actually going to be some...

31:17.040 --> 31:21.140
They're going to have Nintendo videos on there, whatever that's supposed to be.

31:21.140 --> 31:24.500
I don't know if that's, like, the old Nintendo cartoons, you know, like the old Donkey Kong

31:24.500 --> 31:30.660
stuff, and, you know, stuff like that, maybe Captain N. You know, one can hope.

31:30.660 --> 31:31.660
And they're going to also have...

31:31.660 --> 31:32.660
Oh God, no.

31:32.660 --> 31:33.660
They're going to have...

31:33.660 --> 31:35.260
Endless loops of Nintendo breakfast cereal commercials.

31:35.260 --> 31:39.300
Basically, kind of think of, like, you know, family programming.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.720
You know, stuff you'd see on Saturday mornings, that type of stuff.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.380
That's what they're going to have on there.

31:43.380 --> 31:47.500
Now, I don't know if it's actually going to have downloads as well.

31:47.500 --> 31:52.340
It says some downloads will require payments, while others will be free.

31:52.340 --> 31:55.700
There's that humming that one of the mics is causing, I don't know which one.

31:55.700 --> 31:56.700
Is it?

31:56.700 --> 31:57.700
Yeah, here.

31:57.700 --> 31:58.700
It's a very...

31:58.700 --> 31:59.700
That's a very naughty microphone.

31:59.700 --> 32:00.700
Sorry, guys.

32:00.700 --> 32:01.700
Anyway.

32:01.700 --> 32:02.700
Live radio.

32:02.700 --> 32:03.700
Hi.

32:03.700 --> 32:06.980
Yeah, it's going to be coming early next year.

32:06.980 --> 32:13.180
No prices have been announced yet, but interesting, though, that they're going to be bringing

32:13.180 --> 32:14.180
this out.

32:14.180 --> 32:17.740
Maybe this is something that's coming to the US.

32:17.740 --> 32:18.740
I don't know how this...

32:18.740 --> 32:25.220
To be honest, if you've ever used the web browser in this, you know, the bandwidth to

32:25.220 --> 32:30.700
the Wii seems very, very slow, so can you imagine actually downloading content with

32:30.700 --> 32:31.700
the Wii?

32:31.700 --> 32:32.940
You know, like actual videos and stuff?

32:32.940 --> 32:34.980
I think it would take forever.

32:34.980 --> 32:38.820
We kind of need that upgrade that's supposed to get our SD cards, which wasn't that supposed

32:38.820 --> 32:40.540
to be out before the end of the year?

32:40.540 --> 32:41.540
Right.

32:41.540 --> 32:42.980
That won't be coming out until...

32:42.980 --> 32:47.260
You'll probably have to buy a game that'll unlock that or some shit.

32:47.260 --> 32:50.620
Hitstun in chat says, Sky, porno on demand service equals the internet.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.620
Ooh, touche.

32:51.620 --> 32:54.620
But I can't really get that on my TV very easily.

32:54.620 --> 33:00.220
I can use the internet channel or the PS3's internet thingy, I know, but they suck.

33:00.220 --> 33:01.220
They're clunky.

33:01.220 --> 33:02.220
But it works with...

33:02.220 --> 33:04.500
If you're using YouTube on the Wii, it's not that good.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.860
But you can do porno, too.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.820
We did that one time, actually, at a bar.

33:07.820 --> 33:08.820
It was clunky.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.860
Yeah, that was actually last New Year's, wasn't it?

33:10.860 --> 33:12.740
Or two years ago, maybe?

33:12.740 --> 33:13.740
Yeah, I don't know.

33:13.740 --> 33:14.740
Yeah.

33:14.740 --> 33:15.740
Anyway, sorry.

33:15.740 --> 33:16.820
I don't watch porn!

33:16.820 --> 33:17.820
That's sick!

33:17.820 --> 33:20.980
Remember the donkey punch video that they had?

33:20.980 --> 33:21.980
It was...

33:21.980 --> 33:22.980
Shut up!

33:22.980 --> 33:24.820
It was literally a guy dressed as a donkey.

33:24.820 --> 33:25.820
Shut up, monkey!

33:25.820 --> 33:26.820
That was hilarious.

33:26.820 --> 33:28.100
We didn't do that.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.100
Literal puns are funny.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.100
No, we prayed, remember?

33:31.100 --> 33:32.420
Cheese.

33:32.420 --> 33:36.860
Oh, Lord, please let them do a sequel to this video.

33:36.860 --> 33:37.860
Amen.

33:37.860 --> 33:39.140
And pterodactyl porn.

33:39.140 --> 33:40.140
Hey!

33:40.140 --> 33:43.100
Food Delivery Channel is coming to Japan, as well.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.100
That's right.

33:44.100 --> 33:48.440
If you want to get food delivered to you, you can now do that through your Wii.

33:48.440 --> 33:52.020
It's called the Damae Channel, the Food Delivery Channel.

33:52.020 --> 33:54.380
8,500 different restaurants.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.840
Apparently you are going to be able to browse it by genre.

33:56.840 --> 34:02.340
Like pizza, bento boxes, sushi, curry, Chinese, whatever.

34:02.340 --> 34:06.700
You apparently can go on here, and the restaurants will actually estimate what the delivery time

34:06.700 --> 34:07.700
is.

34:07.700 --> 34:11.460
You place the order on the Wii, it's faxed to the restaurant, and then it's kind of like

34:11.460 --> 34:13.060
ordering it on the internet.

34:13.060 --> 34:15.780
And I was kind of like, this has got to be bullshit.

34:15.780 --> 34:18.700
But apparently, there are screenshots and everything.

34:18.700 --> 34:21.860
And granted, this stuff can be photoshopped, but I don't know why someone would want to

34:21.860 --> 34:25.520
waste that colossal amount of time on a stupid prank on Christmas.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.580
So this looks to be the real deal.

34:28.580 --> 34:29.580
I guess so.

34:29.580 --> 34:30.580
I don't know.

34:30.580 --> 34:31.580
But this looks to be pretty authentic.

34:31.580 --> 34:35.780
And which is strange, because people predicted that this might happen a long time ago.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.780
Well, I suppose people predicted everything.

34:37.780 --> 34:40.580
But yeah, you look at this here, and there's even a screenshot here where somebody can

34:40.580 --> 34:43.420
click on like Pizza Hut and order pizza.

34:43.420 --> 34:44.420
Interesting.

34:44.420 --> 34:49.380
I don't know, if they did something like this in the US, do you think?

34:49.380 --> 34:53.860
Man, Pizza Hut is talk about like a whore for like ordering stuff.

34:53.860 --> 34:58.900
I mean, before they were in like EverQuest, you know, now they're in this business.

34:58.900 --> 35:04.100
I would love to have a Pizza Hut here with the Japanese menu.

35:04.100 --> 35:10.340
No, seriously, I was seeing one of the people I keep up with lived over there and posted

35:10.340 --> 35:12.500
a picture of the order menu.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.300
There's some very funky pizzas.

35:14.300 --> 35:17.860
It's like something out of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or California Pizza Kitchen.

35:17.860 --> 35:19.820
Or John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?

35:19.820 --> 35:20.820
No.

35:20.820 --> 35:21.820
OK.

35:21.820 --> 35:26.220
Um, yeah, the thing is, though, I don't think a channel like that would work here because

35:26.220 --> 35:32.540
we're not so, we're so spread out here in the US, whereas in Japan, there's a lot more

35:32.540 --> 35:33.540
kind of, you know what I mean?

35:33.540 --> 35:37.860
Like, I don't think, it might work in different cities, it might work in different, like,

35:37.860 --> 35:41.740
it might, they might be able to do that for New York City for, well, I don't even know

35:41.740 --> 35:44.100
if you could do it in Los Angeles and make it worth it.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.100
I don't know.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.620
But then you say, you talk about how Pizza Hut whores themselves in every game.

35:47.620 --> 35:48.860
Well, that's just good business though, right?

35:48.860 --> 35:52.820
They can get one extra order a day out of it, it's worth it, right?

35:52.820 --> 35:57.740
But the thing in, I don't know, it's just like, I just don't see myself firing up the

35:57.740 --> 36:02.940
Wii to order a pizza when, I don't know, I could use the phone like everybody else.

36:02.940 --> 36:06.860
You can do internet ordering on a lot of these places' sites, too.

36:06.860 --> 36:07.860
That's very true.

36:07.860 --> 36:11.780
AcidicVampire in chat says, Pizza Hut equals Kaka Hut.

36:11.780 --> 36:14.020
Actually, that's probably one of the pizzas you can get in Japan.

36:14.020 --> 36:16.220
You know what, though?

36:16.220 --> 36:19.100
And I'll tell you, their pasta is pretty good.

36:19.100 --> 36:22.740
I actually thought about getting some of that, but the thing, the tray of pasta that they

36:22.740 --> 36:26.420
give you is huge, and that would just look ridiculous if I'm eating a huge tray of pasta

36:26.420 --> 36:27.420
here.

36:27.420 --> 36:28.420
Goodness, we don't have the camera anymore.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.180
Yeah, we don't have the camera.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.980
You could bring an entire cake.

36:31.980 --> 36:32.980
But still, though, I wouldn't.

36:32.980 --> 36:35.260
You could bring an entire cake and eat it on here.

36:35.260 --> 36:36.420
I don't like that much cake.

36:36.420 --> 36:40.340
I'll just say, fatty's eating cake again.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.060
I don't like cake.

36:42.060 --> 36:49.100
Now I did want to make a meatball sub, though, and for some reason I saw on the Food Network

36:49.100 --> 36:51.820
they had this thing where they were making it over to someone's kitchen, and that's what

36:51.820 --> 36:53.340
they decided to make is a meatball sub.

36:53.340 --> 36:54.340
Like, damn, it looks good!

36:54.340 --> 36:57.860
And all of a sudden, you know, I got a craving for a meatball sub.

36:57.860 --> 37:03.660
This is the Pizza Hut menu in Japan as of June, and I want you to tell me if this sounds

37:03.660 --> 37:05.060
tasty to you.

37:05.060 --> 37:11.780
There's bacon mushroom, barbecue chicken, carbonara, which is bacon, egg spread, and

37:11.780 --> 37:12.940
black pepper.

37:12.940 --> 37:14.700
Without the egg spread, yes.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.220
Cheese and cheese.

37:16.220 --> 37:17.220
Sure.

37:17.220 --> 37:18.860
Yes and yes.

37:18.860 --> 37:25.140
Crab and shrimp mayo king, which is five shrimp, fake crab, corn, onion, broccoli, and mayonnaise.

37:25.140 --> 37:27.060
I need the listeners to understand this.

37:27.060 --> 37:28.340
I fucking hate mayonnaise.

37:28.340 --> 37:33.120
Don't you ever give me anything with mayonnaise even remotely near it, because mayonnaise

37:33.120 --> 37:34.580
will ruin anything for me.

37:34.580 --> 37:36.580
I hate, hate, hate mayonnaise.

37:36.580 --> 37:41.660
I hate warm mayonnaise, because warm mayonnaise, like mayonnaise on burgers, awful.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.660
On sandwiches?

37:42.660 --> 37:43.660
Okay.

37:43.660 --> 37:44.660
Well, these are great.

37:44.660 --> 37:47.660
Okay, the deluxe is pepperoni, salami, bacon, and green peppers, blah, blah, blah.

37:47.660 --> 37:48.660
Yes, yes and yes.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.260
Gomodari pork, I'd actually eat that.

37:50.260 --> 37:55.920
It's a burdock root mix, sesame sauce, pork, shredded seaweed, and sesame sauce.

37:55.920 --> 38:01.980
The Idaho special is diced potatoes, bacon, onions, corn, parsley, black pepper, and mayonnaise.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.380
That sounds awesome, except for the mayonnaise part.

38:03.380 --> 38:06.380
There's one called the mayo queue, if you can guess what that is.

38:06.380 --> 38:08.460
It's barbecue with mayonnaise.

38:08.460 --> 38:14.780
Meat paradise, pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.

38:14.780 --> 38:15.780
Loki?

38:15.780 --> 38:16.780
Does that sound good to you?

38:16.780 --> 38:17.780
What?

38:17.780 --> 38:18.780
I think we need to go to Japan.

38:18.780 --> 38:19.780
When?

38:19.780 --> 38:20.780
What was it?

38:20.780 --> 38:21.780
It's called the meat paradise.

38:21.780 --> 38:22.780
And?

38:22.780 --> 38:25.780
It's pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.

38:25.780 --> 38:29.700
That's just, that's just like, they have it already over here.

38:29.700 --> 38:33.980
It's like the Monty's all meat marvel, and the...

38:33.980 --> 38:35.760
Loki connoisseur of meat.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.920
They used to have beef on their pizzas, but they don't do it anymore, because apparently

38:38.920 --> 38:43.100
not that many people like beef, and it kind of went bad because no one ate it.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.100
I want to have a pizza.

38:44.100 --> 38:49.140
Here's a Sicilian style pizza with tuna mushrooms and meat sauce.

38:49.140 --> 38:53.800
We could do a meat pizza, like a round table over here, because they have like multiple

38:53.800 --> 39:00.060
varieties of like, you know, different pepperonis and different, you know, sausages, and they

39:00.060 --> 39:05.060
have, I think they have chicken too, and ham, and God, we could just pile that shit up.

39:05.060 --> 39:08.220
I remember someone that used to order like a quad sausage pizza.

39:08.220 --> 39:09.980
That'd be four times the amount of sausage.

39:09.980 --> 39:15.500
I kid you not, it was like a giant patty on top of the entire pizza.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.500
It's like, what is wrong with you people?

39:17.500 --> 39:19.940
Here, Rob, this one's for you.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.000
Mochi mentai and potato.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.660
Large shrimp diced potatoes, Korean mochi.

39:24.660 --> 39:27.900
Corn, onion, mayonnaise, we'll ask for it without.

39:27.900 --> 39:30.580
Shredded seaweed and fish roe sauce.

39:30.580 --> 39:31.580
Mochi?

39:31.580 --> 39:37.540
Or there's a seafood mix, which is large shrimp, squid, tuna, and mayonnaise, broccoli, and

39:37.540 --> 39:38.540
onion.

39:38.540 --> 39:40.900
Who puts, I want to know who puts corn on a pizza.

39:40.900 --> 39:44.220
All the rest of it I could make, but corn is fucking disgusting.

39:44.220 --> 39:45.220
I've seen it.

39:45.220 --> 39:46.740
And then again, I'm also allergic to corn.

39:46.740 --> 39:48.940
Better yet, who puts mayonnaise on a pizza?

39:48.940 --> 39:53.380
I think they put mayonnaise on everything in Japan.

39:53.380 --> 39:54.380
So I can't go to Japan.

39:54.380 --> 39:55.540
Here we go, the last one on here.

39:55.540 --> 39:56.860
I'd die of starvation.

39:56.860 --> 40:03.500
Tartar chicken nanban, nanban chicken, red peppers, parsley, tartar sauce, and nanban

40:03.500 --> 40:04.500
sauce.

40:04.500 --> 40:09.060
As long as nanban doesn't mean like asshole juice, I'll be fine.

40:09.060 --> 40:10.740
It's basically Portuguese style chicken.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.100
Okay, that's fine.

40:12.100 --> 40:13.100
Like what is that?

40:13.100 --> 40:16.860
That could, when you're talking about a chicken, it could be anything.

40:16.860 --> 40:20.940
All right, anyhow.

40:20.940 --> 40:24.900
Some of this is just like, I would actually eat it though, because some of the stuff I'd

40:24.900 --> 40:30.660
order something similar, and really the cheese and cheese is like a margarita, the margarita

40:30.660 --> 40:31.660
pizza.

40:31.660 --> 40:32.660
Oh yeah.

40:32.660 --> 40:37.620
But I actually would order some of this stuff, because I have a CPK, but still.

40:37.620 --> 40:41.220
Okay, I ordered- How did this turn into Orange Lounge Fudio,

40:41.220 --> 40:42.940
going on like 15 minutes now?

40:42.940 --> 40:46.740
Because, this is why I want them to deliver Japanese style pizza.

40:46.740 --> 40:49.300
And poor Bobby got chased off the air for this?

40:49.300 --> 40:50.300
Yes he did.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.300
Nanban chicken?

40:51.300 --> 40:57.020
Well, if he was talking about pizza, we would have been fine with that.

40:57.020 --> 40:58.940
Note to Bobby, your show needs more meat.

40:58.940 --> 40:59.940
All right.

40:59.940 --> 41:01.340
You need meat paradise!

41:01.340 --> 41:02.940
All right, stop picking on Bobby.

41:02.940 --> 41:03.940
All right.

41:03.940 --> 41:08.620
Dark Sakura, what else is going on in gaming news?

41:08.620 --> 41:13.620
Well, there is this plumber named Mario who lives near a pizza place!

41:13.620 --> 41:15.540
No, I'm kidding.

41:15.540 --> 41:21.780
Basically it's something to be coming out for the virtual console in Japan is Super

41:21.780 --> 41:23.220
Smash Brothers.

41:23.220 --> 41:26.780
Like the Nintendo 64 one, dun dun dun.

41:26.780 --> 41:29.180
It will be there in January.

41:29.180 --> 41:39.380
So it's going to be out there for 1200 points, but there's no real say as to when we'll probably

41:39.380 --> 41:44.700
get it out here or so, but that means we probably will be getting it since we tend to get some

41:44.700 --> 41:52.100
of the stuff that, you know, if it was a release, Yawn and Hither, then it would definitely

41:52.100 --> 41:56.380
be duplicated over here, I would think.

41:56.380 --> 41:59.540
So there, Rob.

41:59.540 --> 42:00.540
That sounds nice.

42:00.540 --> 42:02.580
I guess I would download that.

42:02.580 --> 42:03.580
What?

42:03.580 --> 42:04.580
Meat paradise.

42:04.580 --> 42:09.540
Looking at some comments in chat, Giovedea in chat says, I have had a taco pizza with

42:09.540 --> 42:10.540
corn on it.

42:10.540 --> 42:11.540
It was really tasty.

42:11.540 --> 42:15.500
I was trying to, it's just pizza chat.

42:15.500 --> 42:16.500
I didn't see anything about video games.

42:16.500 --> 42:17.860
I think it should have scampi pizzas.

42:17.860 --> 42:20.380
Except, oh, AcidicVampire asks a good question.

42:20.380 --> 42:22.940
Will Super Smash Brothers 64 have online play?

42:22.940 --> 42:23.940
You wish.

42:23.940 --> 42:24.940
No.

42:24.940 --> 42:25.940
You wish.

42:25.940 --> 42:29.340
Did the Nintendo 64 version have online play?

42:29.340 --> 42:34.300
But in Pokemon Snap, they added the feature where you can save the snaps to your Wii message

42:34.300 --> 42:35.300
board.

42:35.300 --> 42:36.300
So?

42:36.300 --> 42:39.100
So it shows they can enhance the games if they really want to.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.100
So?

42:40.100 --> 42:41.380
And they don't want to.

42:41.380 --> 42:45.860
It makes you wonder, doesn't it make you wonder if maybe Pokemon Snap at one point had some

42:45.860 --> 42:52.780
type of feature to save those pictures in some type of more exportable format that they

42:52.780 --> 42:56.800
just, like the game maybe originally was going to let you, I don't know, save them to some

42:56.800 --> 43:01.980
type of computer or something, and now they turned it into this thing instead?

43:01.980 --> 43:05.860
Because that's the only game that has had anything special happen to it.

43:05.860 --> 43:09.700
When yet you would think a game like this, they would just try to add online play.

43:09.700 --> 43:11.660
But try for us.

43:11.660 --> 43:12.660
No.

43:12.660 --> 43:19.700
They don't want to try because this is the same company that is releasing GameCube games

43:19.700 --> 43:20.940
that you can now play on your Wii.

43:20.940 --> 43:21.940
Oh, wait a second!

43:21.940 --> 43:25.220
You can still play those GameCube games on your Wii already!

43:25.220 --> 43:27.460
It just doesn't have stupid motion controls.

43:27.460 --> 43:28.460
And guess what?

43:28.460 --> 43:31.460
They're cheaper.

43:31.460 --> 43:34.220
Chat dot orange launch radio dot com if you want to chat with us.

43:34.220 --> 43:35.220
Aha!

43:35.220 --> 43:36.420
That's exactly the type of thing I was looking for.

43:36.420 --> 43:37.420
Game Guru in chat.

43:37.420 --> 43:38.980
See, this is why I love having a live chat room.

43:38.980 --> 43:44.420
Because Pokemon Snap had a feature to download them to Blockbuster and print them out.

43:44.420 --> 43:47.940
So it's not, they didn't even really, really enhance it that much.

43:47.940 --> 43:52.700
They took a feature that everybody forgot about, including yours truly, and just changed

43:52.700 --> 43:54.700
it slightly.

43:54.700 --> 43:56.100
It's an altered enhancement.

43:56.100 --> 43:58.980
Wasn't that a Sega Genesis game?

43:58.980 --> 43:59.980
Alright, forget it.

43:59.980 --> 44:02.140
How about some release dates, Loki?

44:02.140 --> 44:04.140
Altered enhancement?

44:04.140 --> 44:08.940
Well, um, yeah.

44:08.940 --> 44:12.500
There's, uh, nothing coming out.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.500
At all.

44:13.500 --> 44:14.500
Nothing?

44:14.500 --> 44:15.500
Not a damn thing?

44:15.500 --> 44:16.500
Not a damn thing.

44:16.500 --> 44:17.500
Alright.

44:17.500 --> 44:18.500
Wow.

44:18.500 --> 44:22.860
I mean, I had this, uh, not a good time of year for, um, you know, most companies are

44:22.860 --> 44:26.300
closed and, yeah, not a thing.

44:26.300 --> 44:28.300
Not even, like, Imagine?

44:28.300 --> 44:33.980
No, uh, the Spore, the Spore comic book creator, I think, was the only thing, and that's not

44:33.980 --> 44:36.540
even technically a game, so.

44:36.540 --> 44:40.860
Well, I wish I could tell you it looked much different in Japan, but it actually does not

44:40.860 --> 44:44.340
look like we have a lot of releases this week either in Japan.

44:44.340 --> 44:49.700
Um, looking very quickly to see, even if there's anything on Wii, no, it's going to be a very

44:49.700 --> 44:50.820
slow month in Japan.

44:50.820 --> 44:54.020
There's very few games coming out even in the first couple weeks of January over in

44:54.020 --> 44:55.020
Japan.

44:55.020 --> 45:01.500
Um, no, the DS, geez, even the DS titles don't start rolling in until the 15th, but hey,

45:01.500 --> 45:06.080
you could pre-order The Happening, which comes out on January 9th on the Sony PSP, but otherwise

45:06.080 --> 45:10.020
there is absolutely nothing coming out in Japan this week.

45:10.020 --> 45:11.020
Well.

45:11.020 --> 45:13.540
How about the UK?

45:13.540 --> 45:19.820
I can't really say that there's a whole bunch coming out in the UK, because, um, first of

45:19.820 --> 45:28.500
all, my list isn't showing 2009, so that's, uh, actually kind of disturbing.

45:28.500 --> 45:31.340
We'll just assume nothing of notice coming out there as well.

45:31.340 --> 45:32.940
Some stuff.

45:32.940 --> 45:35.380
Yeah, really, not a lot.

45:35.380 --> 45:37.020
Well, so much for release dates.

45:37.020 --> 45:38.740
Wah wah, you lose.

45:38.740 --> 45:39.740
Rob.

45:39.740 --> 45:40.740
What?

45:40.740 --> 45:41.740
We've had a call for more pizza.

45:41.740 --> 45:42.740
More pizza?

45:42.740 --> 45:44.100
I can't, I can't even think about more pizza.

45:44.100 --> 45:45.100
I already ate.

45:45.100 --> 45:48.420
Didn't they have, like, a peanut butter and jelly pizza or something, that John's Incredible

45:48.420 --> 45:49.420
Crappy Pizza?

45:49.420 --> 45:51.620
Um, I don't think so.

45:51.620 --> 45:52.620
I don't, well, they might.

45:52.620 --> 45:53.620
I don't know.

45:53.620 --> 45:56.060
I just know, I remember the ones that are, like, different and crazy are the macaroni

45:56.060 --> 45:57.380
and cheese pizza and the, uh,

45:57.380 --> 45:59.220
Are very awful.

45:59.220 --> 46:03.420
That peanut butter one that had the actual peanuts on it, which I thought was strange.

46:03.420 --> 46:05.500
That was actually pretty good, but it was spicy.

46:05.500 --> 46:06.500
Yeah, it was very spicy.

46:06.500 --> 46:13.260
So, I, I, I do have to, though, share a little bit of, um, what, um, is on menus in Japan

46:13.260 --> 46:14.260
for, um, McDonald's.

46:14.260 --> 46:16.660
Alright, why not, since we didn't have release dates?

46:16.660 --> 46:17.660
Let's go back to food.

46:17.660 --> 46:18.660
Filet of shrimp.

46:18.660 --> 46:19.660
Okay.

46:19.660 --> 46:20.660
Yeah.

46:20.660 --> 46:28.660
Um, then there's the Mega Mac, which, imagine a Big Mac with two more patties.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.300
Yum.

46:30.300 --> 46:34.300
And then, um, there's an Ebi, that's, that's the same one, that's the shrimp.

46:34.300 --> 46:38.260
And then the Thousand, the Shrimp Thousand Island Wrap.

46:38.260 --> 46:41.460
You know when I go to, uh, Hawaii in two weeks, you know what I have to get?

46:41.460 --> 46:42.460
Hmm?

46:42.460 --> 46:43.460
A McDonald's?

46:43.460 --> 46:44.460
What?

46:44.460 --> 46:45.460
Spamburger.

46:45.460 --> 46:46.460
Oh my God, aren't those good?

46:46.460 --> 46:47.620
I like Spam musubi.

46:47.620 --> 46:49.780
And the, uh, teriyaki pineapple thingy.

46:49.780 --> 46:50.780
They do, right?

46:50.780 --> 46:57.500
And, um, they also have McPork and, um, the teriyaki McBurger.

46:57.500 --> 46:59.260
So there's more food from around the world.

46:59.260 --> 47:01.300
We do have gaming news at some point, right?

47:01.300 --> 47:02.300
Yes, we do.

47:02.300 --> 47:04.380
I'm looking at Burger King.

47:04.380 --> 47:06.860
Um, yes.

47:06.860 --> 47:15.440
Like the merger of Spam and Shrimp and hamburgers, um, we have yet another game company merger

47:15.440 --> 47:18.900
about to happen with Tecmo and Koei.

47:18.900 --> 47:24.740
They have plans to, um, I guess merge in about two months.

47:24.740 --> 47:32.460
And, um, you know, I guess after rejecting Square Enix's, uh, attempt to take over Tecmo,

47:32.460 --> 47:40.860
they've decided to merge with Koei to release the most ultimate booby bouncing action game

47:40.860 --> 47:46.020
ever set in Fuel Japan, because that's the only thing I could see possibly coming from

47:46.020 --> 47:48.260
this sort of merger.

47:48.260 --> 47:50.940
Booby pizza?

47:50.940 --> 48:01.220
But apparently, um, that they've announced, um, oh, this is actually very old news apparently

48:01.220 --> 48:04.160
and I don't understand how this slipped in.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.160
My bad.

48:05.160 --> 48:10.820
Apparently this already happened, like, a long time ago.

48:10.820 --> 48:12.340
I don't know how this guy makes it in there.

48:12.340 --> 48:13.340
It's not the news.

48:13.340 --> 48:14.340
It's the old.

48:14.340 --> 48:16.340
It is really old.

48:16.340 --> 48:21.020
So I'm like, look at this, it's all, has announced on September 17th, I'm like, what

48:21.020 --> 48:22.020
the fuck?

48:22.020 --> 48:24.220
And it's all September 18th.

48:24.220 --> 48:26.820
You know when I was putting this together tonight, I was kind of like, I thought that

48:26.820 --> 48:28.820
already happened, but I didn't really, you know, I was just so annoyed.

48:28.820 --> 48:29.820
My bad.

48:29.820 --> 48:30.820
But that's weird, though.

48:30.820 --> 48:33.580
Okay, just wait until you say, and see, we were just recapping what happened this year.

48:33.580 --> 48:37.060
Yes, we're totally recapping.

48:37.060 --> 48:38.060
Fuck this shit.

48:38.060 --> 48:39.060
You know what?

48:39.060 --> 48:41.860
I don't care if they merger, because you know what, they're still going to put out fucking

48:41.860 --> 48:44.360
Dynasty Warriors games out the ass.

48:44.360 --> 48:46.460
By the way, Dynasty Warriors, Six Empires comes out February.

48:46.460 --> 48:47.460
You know what?

48:47.460 --> 48:48.460
Fuck the show.

48:48.460 --> 48:49.460
Let's go get pizza.

48:49.460 --> 48:50.460
Really?

48:50.460 --> 48:56.420
The sad thing is, I'm half serious.

48:56.420 --> 49:00.700
If there was a way we could somehow, like, just take the camera and go out on the road

49:00.700 --> 49:04.340
and take it with us to get pizza, I would totally do it.

49:04.340 --> 49:05.620
I would say yes.

49:05.620 --> 49:07.860
I would say, the hell with the show, pizza.

49:07.860 --> 49:09.020
Anyway, sorry.

49:09.020 --> 49:11.000
We can't do that, Rob.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
We love our people.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.180
I know, we do love our people.

49:13.180 --> 49:17.220
Whatever, I give up, you know.

49:17.220 --> 49:18.860
I don't know how I went back that far.

49:18.860 --> 49:22.820
All right, well look, I have something that I promise is current, because just in time

49:22.820 --> 49:25.740
for the holidays, Konami sued someone.

49:25.740 --> 49:26.740
That's right.

49:26.740 --> 49:30.740
Konami loves to sue people over music games, and this week, who did Konami sue?

49:30.740 --> 49:33.100
Pentavision, the makers of DJ Max.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.060
That's right.

49:35.060 --> 49:40.300
They have claimed patent infringement, Konami has, and intellectual property rights infringement.

49:40.300 --> 49:43.800
This was Konami of Korea that actually did it, because they're, you know, filing this

49:43.800 --> 49:46.100
lawsuit against a Korean company.

49:46.100 --> 49:49.100
They filed it in the Seoul Central District Court in Korea.

49:49.100 --> 49:50.580
They want to get damages.

49:50.580 --> 49:55.020
They want to stop Pentavision from selling the offending products, quote unquote, which

49:55.020 --> 50:02.460
of course has unleashed the outcries of not fair, unfair, Konami sues everybody and everything,

50:02.460 --> 50:07.660
and Konami, you suck, and da da da da da, and all this stuff, but I don't know.

50:07.660 --> 50:08.860
How do you guys feel about this?

50:08.860 --> 50:11.140
I mean, I don't know how many of you have played DJ Max.

50:11.140 --> 50:12.620
I've definitely seen the game played.

50:12.620 --> 50:16.580
I have a friend who's obsessed with it, and made it a point to show me, you know, DJ Max,

50:16.580 --> 50:19.980
and wanted to show me what the game was all about, and, you know, I did look at it and

50:19.980 --> 50:26.620
go, wow, this really looks like Beatmania.

50:26.620 --> 50:30.980
I mean, granted, I realize it's played with buttons, it's not exactly the same, but the

50:30.980 --> 50:37.300
look and feel was kind of the same, I'm sorry to say, you know, but I don't know.

50:37.300 --> 50:41.900
Do the people that say, hey, Konami just sues everything, is there a point here, what?

50:41.900 --> 50:43.100
What do you guys think?

50:43.100 --> 50:48.980
I'm really not surprised in the least, so I'm just going to roll my eyes and go next.

50:48.980 --> 50:55.300
I am surprised because I thought, you know, and I could be very wrong about this, but

50:55.300 --> 51:01.900
I thought that Pentavision, actually the company that makes DJ Max, came out of the company

51:01.900 --> 51:08.540
that made EZ2DJ, since most of the artists in DJ Max are from EZ2DJ.

51:08.540 --> 51:13.900
I would find that as a very big coincidence if that was not the case, but I would figure

51:13.900 --> 51:18.580
that it's more of a ripoff of EZ2DJ, and who cares?

51:18.580 --> 51:26.260
To be honest, I thought EZ2DJ was better than Beatmania anyways, so, whatever, and they're

51:26.260 --> 51:30.160
going to go ahead and sue them, probably because they're planning on making some crappy music

51:30.160 --> 51:36.420
game for the PSP or something, because, you know, Konami's on the latest and greatest

51:36.420 --> 51:38.140
trends for music games.

51:38.140 --> 51:40.300
Oh wait, no, they're not anymore.

51:40.300 --> 51:43.940
They're way behind everything.

51:43.940 --> 51:47.700
So Hanukkah Harry in chat says, is all a trap set up by Konami.

51:47.700 --> 51:51.500
By not releasing quality versions of Guitar Freak, Strummania, and Beatmania in the US,

51:51.500 --> 51:54.420
they are setting up other companies to come out with copies of them.

51:54.420 --> 51:57.760
Konami then sues them and gets a piece of the action without lifting a finger, except

51:57.760 --> 51:59.760
to call their lawyers.

51:59.760 --> 52:04.020
You know, as much as that makes sense, I don't think that's it.

52:04.020 --> 52:07.660
I don't think Konami in their minds thinks they're not doing a good enough job.

52:07.660 --> 52:11.780
I think Konami thinks Rock Revolution is a quality product.

52:11.780 --> 52:16.820
I think there are people at Konami, probably Konami Japan, that think that that is what

52:16.820 --> 52:19.260
people want.

52:19.260 --> 52:25.180
The Guitar Hero and Rock Band are the sub-par games.

52:25.180 --> 52:31.340
Rock Revolution is a wonderful game, and these other games are infringing on the rightful

52:31.340 --> 52:33.820
heir to the music game throne, which is Rock Revolution.

52:33.820 --> 52:41.700
The problem now is that they wanted to make a music game, and they're worried about fridging

52:41.700 --> 52:45.940
on other people's patents, and now, unfortunately, since they came out with a drum that's totally

52:45.940 --> 52:50.780
different than what Drummania had, the best thing they could do is come out with what

52:50.780 --> 52:53.900
they did for Drummania, basically, and bring it over here.

52:53.900 --> 53:00.540
And at the time, it was kind of neat as a drum game, but things have gotten a lot better

53:00.540 --> 53:05.540
since then, and they can't come out with something that looks similar because they will get sued

53:05.540 --> 53:10.100
by the other companies, and there'll be kind of a 180 for them.

53:10.100 --> 53:13.700
Hanaka Harry wants to clarify, he was mostly joking with the comment, but I have seen that

53:13.700 --> 53:17.820
comment for real reals and different threads around the internet about this.

53:17.820 --> 53:21.900
And if you think I'm wrong in what I'm saying about that Konami of Japan is seriously disillusioned

53:21.900 --> 53:26.420
to their fan base, all you need to do is look at Beat and Groovy and Rock Revolution, because

53:26.420 --> 53:28.860
these are the products Konami is continuing to put out.

53:28.860 --> 53:32.340
Yeah, but see, I think in Japan, though, they're actually putting out some good games over

53:32.340 --> 53:33.340
there.

53:33.340 --> 53:38.460
Like, if you look, for example, at the new Dance Dance Revolution, what would be the

53:38.460 --> 53:42.080
equivalent of Hoz Party 2 over there on the Wii, it's actually a lot better than it is

53:42.080 --> 53:43.080
over here.

53:43.080 --> 53:47.460
Like, they have different types of music and stuff like that, which obviously applies to

53:47.460 --> 53:49.780
more of the people that play the Wii over there.

53:49.780 --> 53:56.580
And then you also have Juby and stuff like that, which look pretty good.

53:56.580 --> 54:01.820
But I don't know, I don't think necessarily, I think they don't really know what their

54:01.820 --> 54:07.480
audience is anymore, and that's pretty sad.

54:07.480 --> 54:12.700
But at the same time, they can't honestly look at Rock Revolution as a success, because

54:12.700 --> 54:13.700
it's not.

54:13.700 --> 54:16.740
I mean, look at how fast that thing price dropped.

54:16.740 --> 54:19.420
Look at the sales for it, I mean, I think they speak for themselves.

54:19.420 --> 54:24.140
It was a waste of effort on their part, and it wasn't much of an effort to begin with,

54:24.140 --> 54:28.300
so you get what you put into it, I guess.

54:28.300 --> 54:34.220
Here's my thought, and tell me if I'm off-base with this one, but I believe that if you're

54:34.220 --> 54:39.220
pissed off about this, whether you're a fan of DJ Max, or a fan of music games who is

54:39.220 --> 54:44.340
getting a little frustrated at Konami's putting out sub-par music games and then trying to

54:44.340 --> 54:48.740
take out these other guys, I think now's the time for you to take five minutes of your

54:48.740 --> 54:52.600
life to sit down and write an angry letter.

54:52.600 --> 54:57.600
And I don't mean an unprofessional letter, I mean an angry, concerned, person who spends

54:57.600 --> 55:00.240
money on Konami, letter.

55:00.240 --> 55:05.820
And I think you need to send them a letter and tell them exactly what you think.

55:05.820 --> 55:11.000
And don't use profanity, don't use words that you wouldn't say in front of your mother,

55:11.000 --> 55:15.540
but you need to tell them that you know what, that you find it's very wrong, that they would

55:15.540 --> 55:19.420
continue to sue these companies over-enteringing on the products when they are not putting

55:19.420 --> 55:23.420
out Beat Media games in the US, and that you really want to see, if they're going to stop

55:23.420 --> 55:27.080
these other products from coming out, that you want to see a new Beat Media game be released

55:27.080 --> 55:28.080
in the US.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.080
But here's the problem.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.080
What?

55:30.080 --> 55:32.460
They're suing them in Korea because these games are coming out in Korea.

55:32.460 --> 55:34.820
It's not anything to do with the US version.

55:34.820 --> 55:37.180
People are just figuring that because of that...

55:37.180 --> 55:40.940
Wait, wait, wait, but you don't think the US version had nothing to do with this?

55:40.940 --> 55:41.940
Yes, I don't.

55:41.940 --> 55:43.260
I think you're wrong.

55:43.260 --> 55:47.420
Because these Korean versions have been out for a while now, but isn't it funny?

55:47.420 --> 55:51.480
When did they sue the people that made In the Groove when the home version was announced?

55:51.480 --> 55:55.540
When are they suing the people that made the Penn Division thing when the US DJ Max was

55:55.540 --> 55:57.660
on its way out?

55:57.660 --> 56:00.660
There's a correlation there.

56:00.660 --> 56:02.500
I'm convinced that...

56:02.500 --> 56:05.860
I understand this is all going down in Korean court of law, but it's still an international

56:05.860 --> 56:13.060
company who has much bigger interests in the US and Japan.

56:13.060 --> 56:14.420
So I don't know.

56:14.420 --> 56:18.780
Dark Sakura, sometimes you like to give your input on these types of protests and business

56:18.780 --> 56:19.780
stories.

56:19.780 --> 56:23.500
What do you think would be the best thing for a person to do who's ticked off?

56:23.500 --> 56:27.780
Honestly, it's going to be send in your letters.

56:27.780 --> 56:28.780
Buy stock.

56:28.780 --> 56:29.780
Shit.

56:29.780 --> 56:31.700
What did we say before?

56:31.700 --> 56:37.600
Buy stock in the company, then you have a right to be heard as a shareholder.

56:37.600 --> 56:40.340
But don't post an angry thing on the internet.

56:40.340 --> 56:44.100
Post petition online, because you know what that's going to do?

56:44.100 --> 56:45.100
Nothing.

56:45.100 --> 56:46.100
Absolutely nothing.

56:46.100 --> 56:50.100
The only type of petition that's going to have any real swing is if you get your signatures,

56:50.100 --> 56:54.420
make a copy, and send it to Konami.

56:54.420 --> 57:00.060
Because then the people that are advocating for you at Konami, of which there have been

57:00.060 --> 57:02.160
some, look at Jason Enos.

57:02.160 --> 57:04.040
Would you have ever had DDR in the US without him?

57:04.040 --> 57:05.820
Don't think so.

57:05.820 --> 57:10.300
The people that are advocating for you there have something to take back to Japan and say,

57:10.300 --> 57:14.940
look, you are out of touch.

57:14.940 --> 57:16.940
Just saying.

57:16.940 --> 57:21.700
Anyhow, more gaming news, things going on in the gaming world.

57:21.700 --> 57:23.620
Dark Sakura?

57:23.620 --> 57:24.940
Let me see.

57:24.940 --> 57:32.120
Oh, just a little game that a few people were playing and then it went, um, started going

57:32.120 --> 57:34.460
poop.

57:34.460 --> 57:36.720
Tabula Rasa.

57:36.720 --> 57:45.260
So NCSoft is saying that Tabula Rasa is free to play and will be free to play until the

57:45.260 --> 57:51.300
28th of February, 2009, when they take down the servers.

57:51.300 --> 57:58.180
So you can actually get a serial code from the support website and download the client

57:58.180 --> 58:00.460
and you can play.

58:00.460 --> 58:06.080
So it will ask you for your credit card number, but they're not going to charge you for shit.

58:06.080 --> 58:10.580
So enjoy it while it lasts.

58:10.580 --> 58:13.360
That's just weird that they want your credit card number even though they're not actually

58:13.360 --> 58:14.360
going to charge you.

58:14.360 --> 58:16.020
Doesn't that seem a little weird?

58:16.020 --> 58:18.900
I think it's just because it's how the site's set up to do.

58:18.900 --> 58:20.220
I guess.

58:20.220 --> 58:23.740
But I bet there's a lot of people to get a little, maybe, maybe they want to make sure

58:23.740 --> 58:27.540
that they are like actual people and not like spam bots or something.

58:27.540 --> 58:28.540
Maybe.

58:28.540 --> 58:29.540
I don't know.

58:29.540 --> 58:30.540
That makes sense, but I don't see why they would care.

58:30.540 --> 58:31.540
Yeah, true.

58:31.540 --> 58:32.540
I mean, then again, it is their, their bandwidth.

58:32.540 --> 58:34.060
So true.

58:34.060 --> 58:37.900
Maybe it's a way to kind of like, even though it's free, it's like squelched a little bit

58:37.900 --> 58:40.340
so that only people who really want to do it, do it.

58:40.340 --> 58:41.340
I don't know.

58:41.340 --> 58:42.940
It could possibly be.

58:42.940 --> 58:43.940
Who knows?

58:43.940 --> 58:45.060
I mean, hey, free.

58:45.060 --> 58:46.900
Anybody here think they might check it out?

58:46.900 --> 58:47.900
No.

58:47.900 --> 58:48.900
Nope.

58:48.900 --> 58:49.900
I might.

58:49.900 --> 58:50.900
I might.

58:50.900 --> 58:53.500
I feel like I want to know what I'm missing.

58:53.500 --> 58:56.240
But it's kind of weird that they're doing this because what if suddenly people find

58:56.240 --> 58:57.460
that they really like this game?

58:57.460 --> 59:00.740
Well then that gives them incentive to put it back to P2P.

59:00.740 --> 59:01.740
I guess.

59:01.740 --> 59:02.740
We'll see.

59:02.740 --> 59:03.740
Moving on.

59:03.740 --> 59:08.420
Well, another virtual world that's doing pretty well right now is Home, and apparently they've

59:08.420 --> 59:13.580
had quite a boost for pay-for-content sales.

59:13.580 --> 59:17.060
And yes, unfortunately I did contribute a little bit to that.

59:17.060 --> 59:19.100
I'm so glad you said it so I didn't have to.

59:19.100 --> 59:23.020
Hey, it's just a little bit okay.

59:23.020 --> 59:29.860
But I guess during, in the first four days of the open beta, Home produced more money

59:29.860 --> 59:35.100
for Sony than the video download service did in its first week.

59:35.100 --> 59:37.220
I'm not surprised.

59:37.220 --> 59:44.100
And I guess the biggest sellers are the ridiculously priced Santa outfits.

59:44.100 --> 59:45.500
Huh.

59:45.500 --> 59:47.180
Oops.

59:47.180 --> 59:56.060
And yeah, they basically said it's a classic 80-20 model.

59:56.060 --> 01:00:04.540
20% of your consumers create 80% of your income, but there is a lot of stuff that you can purchase

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.540
in it.

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.260
I mean, they're going to be adding more to it.

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.980
Honestly, other than purchasing that Santa outfit, I don't think I'm going to be buying

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:13.980
anything else on this.

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:17.480
And to be honest, I don't think I'm going to be wasting much time on Home anyways unless

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.100
they really do something that's worthwhile.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.100
Because I tried playing one of the...

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.880
Make your trophy room.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.880
Not even the trophy room.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.060
I mean, I tried playing one of the little UFO shooter games or something that was in

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.100
there, and the whole thing crashed.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.100
Which was awesome.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.100
Nice.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.660
So I'm like, nope, I'm not wasting my time on this.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.720
The Ecochrome one's not bad.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.820
Is it just the Ecochrome demo, or?

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:38.820
Um, kinda.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.580
It's like a little Ecochrome minigame.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.300
It's worth checking out.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.300
You know what's interesting though?

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.900
They don't say, like, what was available on the store in the first week in the video store.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.880
Like maybe it's making not a fair comparison here, because maybe the video store had very

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.260
slim pickings the first week.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.140
So it was like all old stuff.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.140
I mean, I don't know.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.020
I don't remember, because I didn't have a PS3 back then.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.020
I don't remember.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:05.540
I didn't use the video service, so I don't know.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.740
Some people are excited about Home though.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.740
We have Trishlicious in chat says, uh, gotta save some cash and get a PS3 for Home.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.740
I want to make content.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:15.780
Uh, AcidicVampire says, there are Ecochrome cults in Home.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.780
Seriously.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.140
I wouldn't be surprised.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.060
Ecochrome's kinda neat.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.060
It's different.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.420
Very different kind of game.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:27.500
Also talking about something else with Home, talking about some of the words that have

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:31.180
been censored in Home, apparently it actually got picked up by the San Francisco Chronicle.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:34.740
The San Francisco Chronicle is writing a story about PlayStation Home, and it's kind of what

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:39.420
makes it notable, because it was focusing the article on this gentleman, Michael Marsh,

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.500
and he was actually trying to set up a gay straight alliance club in Home.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.180
He's a straight guy who's a supporter of gay rights.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:50.940
However, he found that the words gay and bisexual were not allowed in Sony's virtual world.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:57.020
Meaning that there were a lot of kind of words to be discovered that were not able to be

01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:03.500
used in Home, including hell, Christ, Jew, which by the way means all derivatives of

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.740
those words cannot be used either.

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:11.580
So you cannot say, hello, because it has hell in it.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.940
I'm not lying.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:20.900
And the San Francisco Chronicle ran a quote from this guy who was trying to set up the

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:25.340
club, who I think sums up the way a lot of people are thinking, quote, I can understand

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:30.100
that they're filtering out profanity, but it feels like it's discrimination.

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:34.460
By blocking a word like gay, which is a preferred term by the gay community, you're encouraging

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.260
it as a bad word.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:41.620
A city vampire in chat says gay is allowed now, so who knows, maybe Sony made a hot fix

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.220
because of this news.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:46.500
Why don't people just get over it?

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.500
The end.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.700
Get over it.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.940
My whole thing is that, you know, and somebody had posted this in a showreel thread saying

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.900
this is probably a story that would piss me off.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:55.900
It kind of doesn't.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.800
I think it's more silly than anything else.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.260
It makes me think back on like, remember Phantasy Star Online?

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.820
Like there were a bunch of words that you couldn't say because they had other words

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:04.820
in them.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.160
Like I can't remember what some of the words were, but there were like normal everyday

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.160
words you could say.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.580
Saturday because you can't say turd.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:14.900
Yeah, you can't say Saturday and things like that.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.220
It just reminds me of this.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.220
It's the same thing.

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.020
Honestly, I don't know, it's not that big a deal to me.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.660
At least it's consistent.

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.660
I don't know.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:24.660
But here's my thing.

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.620
I don't think they should censor words at all.

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:29.060
I think that people, because people will get around it.

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.060
Exactly.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.420
Like Tiger Claw says they can spell it as H3LLO.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.420
How about this?

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.900
Have an option where you can turn it on or off.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.020
Oh my god!

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.020
Look at that!

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:42.140
You can censor stuff or you can, you know, not censor stuff and maybe you can even have

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:45.740
parental controls because everybody likes parental controls.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.420
Why can't services like this...

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.340
Okay, here's my suggestion.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.480
Services like this should have a button.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:56.580
If I press that button on a user, then it should send the last 20 things that user has

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.420
said to Sony so Sony can review it and decide if this person should be allowed to be in

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.100
home anymore or not.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.560
If I'm abusing this, then I should have the button taken away from me.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.060
How hard is this?

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.660
How hard would this system be?

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.760
And then I think you should be able to say fucking shit and cock and gay and fag and

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.660
all that stuff as much as you want.

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:20.340
You can say any of it, just as long as you're, you know, not saying it to children or people

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.900
that are, you know, are not your friends and should not be hearing it.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.620
Does that make sense?

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.980
Or in your own little room apartment thing.

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:28.980
Yeah.

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.700
That's a little weird.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.940
Frisbee says don't spend the money on home or Second Life.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:33.940
Spend it on real life.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:38.700
Well, home is free, to be fair, but I don't know.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:44.380
I, you know, for me it was, I think, I can't remember how many pieces it took to make this

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:50.340
Santa outfit, but it was like $2.50 and yeah, that's probably $2.50 more than I should have

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:55.060
spent it on home, you know, but it's $2.50 and I was like, whatever, you know, I buy

01:04:55.060 --> 01:05:00.620
these stupid $5, $10 games from live and who cares?

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.620
It's $2.50.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:05.620
SSJ100 Matt says in chat, asshole juice?

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.140
Definitely banned.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.140
Definitely banned.

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:12.700
GS68 says sophomore would be banned.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:17.540
It has homo in it, S-O-P-H-O-M-O-R-E.

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.180
Probably another word that's banned in home.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.180
I don't know.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.300
You know, at least, at least it's consistent, but I don't know.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:27.700
Just I think this is a case of a few bad apples ruined the barrel for everyone and there's

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:31.520
people that don't know how to use these words in proper context and because of these assholes,

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:35.740
the rest of us have to pay the price of this hypersensitivity and hair trigger of which

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:38.340
we've seen Sony use before.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:48.140
So, to these people who are just abusing with, you know, free speech and what is given to

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.460
them, we dedicate the FUs of the week to you.

01:05:51.460 --> 01:06:12.660
FU to Dalmore for being in Korea.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:18.700
I want to order eyeballs and wigs from that site and they're in Korea, so $20 pair of

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:25.700
eyes, cost me $45 after EMS shipping, it's like a bunch of dad.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:26.700
Loki!

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:35.580
FU to my need to buy yet another airsoft gun because I, you know, I bought a shotgun actually

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.860
that's pretty cool.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:41.940
I thought it shot three rounds at once, but it doesn't, which is disappointing, but you

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:46.160
can fire it pretty fast, which is cool.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:53.100
But I have this urge to have another AEG gun, and I really shouldn't buy another one.

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.100
Arcade EM42, do you have any FUs of the week?

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:59.980
FUs of the never-ending clutter in my apartment, which I never get around to.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:06.820
Hopefully I'll get the time off I have this week from one of my jobs is off, so get something

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.820
every day, hopefully.

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:09.980
I can actually clean the damn thing.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.020
You know, I think some of your clutter spilled over into the garage here somehow, I think

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.100
you might have.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.460
I would like to say a big FU to the year 2008.

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.460
Good riddance.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:21.460
I hate you.

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.460
Goodbye.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.880
You are the weakest link.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.380
That's it.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.420
Let's get back into some gaming news now that we've gotten that angst off our chest.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.340
Do you feel better, Rob?

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.340
Much.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.580
Well, how about Braid?

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.980
I like to braid my hair now that it's long enough.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:37.980
Haha.

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:38.980
Haha.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:44.140
But seriously, Braid, the game that came out for Xbox Live Arcade, is going to be out on

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.780
the PC between February and March 2009.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:53.980
So they don't know if it's, they actually are also thinking that there's going to be

01:07:53.980 --> 01:08:00.380
a Mac version 2, which would be cool, and no word yet if there's going to be a version

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.380
for PS3.

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:02.380
All right.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.380
Hm.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:04.380
Hm.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.380
Speaking of PS3.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.500
So there's games on the Mac, huh?

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.500
A few.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:18.380
Speaking of the PS3, Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 2 is just released, and there is a

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:22.900
problem with the game, unfortunately, that apparently a bunch of users are reporting

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:27.140
that there is a glitch that renders their save files completely useless.

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:32.300
Selecting a corrupted save file will freeze the gamers on a permanent loading screen.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:36.700
And apparently this is a, you know, something that's going to be patched soon, however,

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:41.620
because of the holidays, Sony's QA department is taking a little break.

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:48.180
So that means that the patch will not be available until after the new year, sometime in January.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.460
That sucks.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.020
Huh.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.180
This seems like the type of thing that Penny Arcade would have done a comic about.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.620
Is it just me?

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.740
But somehow I don't think there will actually be one.

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.340
Hey, speaking of patches, this has been a long awaited one.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:09.300
Castle Crashers apparently is finally getting its patch.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.140
That's only about four months late.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.100
The patch, I believe, went up this week.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:18.060
I think it actually was scheduled to go up on Christmas Day.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.820
No, Christmas Eve.

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:21.420
I think it went up finally.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:27.420
So hey, you should go back and play some Castle Crashers, because now you can online anyway.

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.060
So there you go.

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:36.060
Apparently some extra things were thrown in as well, though, not just some fixes to the

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:41.380
game, but apparently I think they did some other little, like, new things, like weapons

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.140
and stuff like that, and two new characters.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:46.180
The king is one of them, and so on.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.180
And a chainsaw?

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.180
Do I see a chainsaw?

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:49.180
Yes, there is a new weapon, the chainsaw.

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.180
Sweet!

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.180
There you go.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.420
I'll have to play that now.

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.740
So check that out if you, that's one of those titles I didn't pay money for, because everybody

01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.580
told me you really couldn't play it online.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.020
But maybe I'll go back and check it out now.

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:04.780
But I still think, my gut tells me they'll put it on sale in three months' time, so I

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.260
don't know, I might try to hold out.

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.980
Game guru in chat says, Castle Crashers?

01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:08.980
What's that?

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:09.980
Who cares about that anymore?

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.260
A Twitch acidic vampire says, I like Castle Crashers.

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.260
Cry.

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:18.620
Anyway, let's move on.

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.620
Moving forward...

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:27.740
Oh, I'm sorry, I completely blanked.

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.060
How about the Gizmondo?

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.220
Do we remember this thing?

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.220
How about it?

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:37.340
Well, they are, once again, rescheduling the launch of the Gizmondo.

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.060
They haven't given up.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:46.500
The quote says it's due to the economic climate in the US, as well as the rest of the world.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:52.460
Maybe it might have something to do with your product being crap.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:11:00.300
At any rate, they were deciding to turn the Gizmondo into a smartphone with a 3D graphics

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.020
chip and an open platform.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:08.740
So basically, they're just trying to make another gaming taco.

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:09.740
But open platform?

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:17.500
Yeah, they actually wanted to have an open source app store for the Apple store compatibility.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.340
Oh, now that's kind of nice.

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.340
I like that.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:22.820
I like open.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:27.100
And they wanted to make the price point $99.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.580
So maybe...

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:31.540
Still wouldn't buy it.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.540
You know what?

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:38.400
I bet you anything that Duke Nukem Forever will be on it.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.900
You know what's funny, though, is that it's funny they want to go that route, but I probably

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:45.420
wouldn't buy one just because of the fact that I have an iPhone, and so I can have the

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.700
open stuff already.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.540
I can get almost anything on my iPhone.

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.900
They're going to have to show me something I can get on their system that I cannot get

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.300
on my phone.

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:58.380
Lots of delays and revisions before the product's even released.

01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.380
That's what you can get with the Gizmondo.

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:03.260
You know, I've got to say, though, I know you're not a big fan of the iPhones, Loki,

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:10.000
but I've got to say, it is pretty impressive that I can have movies that I like and music

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:18.440
and games and apps on my phone in my pocket everywhere I go.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.740
And you get a wonderful data plan that goes along with that that's really expensive.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.480
Congratulations.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.140
It's worth it, honestly.

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.440
It's not worth it.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.500
One thing people forget, in my opinion, it's worth it.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:41.180
And well, like with my iPhone, for me and Dan, our overall cost went up by $10 only

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:47.460
once we, you know, adjusted some stuff we were being overcharged for before, but still,

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.460
I like it.

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.460
I got katamari now.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:54.260
Uh, GS68 says, I have an iPod touch, thereby bypassing the phone plan thingy.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:57.580
Rama says, yeah, but Sky, my phone, does the same thing, and I don't have to pay an extra

01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:58.580
fee for it.

01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.580
There you go.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.580
Diverse opinions.

01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:04.100
No thanks, I will never own an Apple product.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.100
Never ever.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:09.860
I don't care if Nintendo had a fucking orgy with Apple and their next product is like

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:15.160
super awesome virtual reality that pleasures me, I will not buy this fucking system if

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.160
it's Apple.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.160
I'm sorry.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.380
I will never ever own anything.

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:25.980
If they make a pacemaker that's the only pacemaker on the face of the planet that will save my

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:31.460
life, I will say let me die before I even take that thing.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.460
Seriously.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.900
Never ever will I fall victim to them.

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:39.300
Please somebody record this part of the show just in case, because you know there's going

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:44.780
to be that day where Apple puts out bacon or something that Loki is going to have it,

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:48.940
and we all have to remind him of this moment and say, told you so.

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:54.740
Alright, anyways, apparently there is a new guitar here coming out.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.740
Shock!

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:56.740
Is there a guitar hero?

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:57.740
Really?

01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:58.740
That they would do that?

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:03.260
Well this one's on the DS, yes I know, it's surprising, you know, what, three releases

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.700
in a matter of months?

01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:13.140
But there is a new DS game coming out, it was actually found out through a description

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:19.500
on the ESRB website, yes, Guitar Hero Modern Hits will be coming out and they've already

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:23.180
figured out what three of the songs are going to be based on, this short description that

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:29.540
was talking about, you know, possible offensive lyrics, well the three songs that are pretty

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:35.300
much confirmed to be in the game, Sum 41's Still Waiting, Franz Ferdinand's The Fallen,

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:41.260
and Paralyzer by Finger Eleven, and no word on when Modern Hits will be out, but you can

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:45.380
better believe that there will be a ton more releases next year for Guitar Hero, both on

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:48.620
the DS and probably on the rest of it.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:53.700
Is the DSi going to screw this all up, because, you know, it's going to be a different system,

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.420
so will that expansion thing have problems or what?

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.980
Here's the way I look at it, I don't think so because there's so many million DS systems

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:07.580
out there already that, you know, big deal, there just will not be another version, or

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:13.060
it will just not be compatible with, you know, the DSi.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.540
You think there will be several versions, or what?

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:19.900
Well I just don't think that they'll put out a version for the DSi, or maybe the DSi gets

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:29.600
drums or something stupid like that, I mean, honestly, they could maybe make a new peripheral

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:36.380
for the DSi that would plug into the SD card slot, just a thought, you know, maybe a DSi

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:40.960
only version or something like that.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.820
I don't think it's going to be an issue though, because like I said, there's so many systems

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.820
out there right now for the DS.

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:49.900
I'm actually kind of surprised that they're even releasing the DSi anytime soon in the

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:56.500
US, because they're still selling tons and tons and tons of DSes, I mean, I would wait

01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:03.540
until it slows down before they release the DSi, and I think that they are going to probably

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:09.980
release the DSi soon, just to try to get people to buy another DS, just like they did with

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.380
the Game Boy Advance.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:16.860
Never forget how many times you bought the Game Boy Advance, or the Game Boy.

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.260
How many times did they release it?

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:24.460
You know, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Player, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.460
HD.

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:26.460
Alright, we get it, we get it.

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.460
Yeah.

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:31.780
Alright, hey, another lawsuit going on in the Nintendo world, and it's Nintendo's getting

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:37.580
sued over their DS Lite Charger, and it's because of a fire that happened in January

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:39.460
of 2007 in Kentucky.

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:43.700
Apparently the victims were compensated by the insurance company, as usually happens

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:44.700
those types of things.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:51.540
The insurance company, though, filed a complaint against Nintendo now in the US District Court,

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:56.460
saying quote, the DS was defective in design, manufacture, and or because it failed to warn

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.680
consumers of dangers associated with it.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.580
Due to defects existing within the product, which caused a risk of overheating and fire,

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:05.340
the product was recalled by Nintendo.

01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:09.700
So what makes this notable, in my opinion, is that you can't blame this on some crazy

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:13.420
asshole, but now it's some crazy asshole's insurance company, no I'm just teasing, but

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:17.860
you know, it's an insurance company suing Nintendo now.

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:21.380
What do you guys think, hearing that this is coming from an actual other company, and

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:25.660
this is Liberty Mutual, it's not some little podunk insurance company, is suing Nintendo

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:26.660
over the charger.

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:31.020
Do you think it's going to be a valid thing, do you think people are too sue happy?

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.520
Any thoughts?

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:38.140
I think that they forgot how hot the DS really is.

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:40.140
So hot that it catches fire.

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:47.500
Well, if it's a liability issue, and they haven't put in any type of significant warning

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:53.380
that is negligence on the part of Nintendo, so yeah, it's a legitimate suit.

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.860
I don't see any problem with it.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:56.860
Alright.

01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:03.820
Let's see, GS68 in chat says, I think everybody is trying to kill Nintendo with lawsuit-y

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:04.820
death.

01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.900
You know who should sue Nintendo?

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:07.900
Kami.

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:10.380
Then the circle will be complete.

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:14.860
It's the circle of lawsuits.

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:15.860
Forget it.

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:20.400
Hey, every week here on Orange Launch Radio, we like to highlight a game from the past.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:25.260
We like to kind of dig into the archives of gaming history and choose one game to highlight

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:31.780
here on the program as the classic video game of the week.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:35.460
So let's travel through the halls of gaming history with Dark Soccer right now and hold

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:40.700
her hand as she guides us to a game that you all should be checking out immediately.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:45.260
Rob put me to sleep with his...

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.260
Shut up.

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:48.260
Read the game.

01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:52.460
The game is Sonic Adventure.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.980
And I picked the best music ever.

01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:57.100
We want music, Rob.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.100
It's going to take a minute.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.100
Better not.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:03.100
We just have to play some of this.

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:11.700
The, what is it, Speed Highway?

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.700
Yep.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:13.700
Yep.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:26.660
I had to pick the Speed Highway music because that's honestly so much my favorite level

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:31.180
of the game except for playing as Knuckles and then I like going through the Red Mountain

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:33.180
with Knuckles.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:39.700
But anyways, Sonic Adventure, this is the game that made me buy my, that made me import

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:44.980
my Dreamcast because I wanted to play this that badly.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:55.000
And so it came out actually on December 23rd, 1998 in Japan.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.920
And it was the first game in the Sonic Adventure series.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:10.700
It actually came out in America, the very final version, as Sonic Adventure International

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:16.480
on September 9th, 1999 which was of course the Dreamcast launch date in America.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:24.440
I was in line, on September 14th, 1999 it came out in Europe and a little bit later

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.980
that in Belgium and December 3rd in Australia.

01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:33.060
I just had to say that because I wanted to mention Belgium and Luxembourg.

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:39.660
So moving forward, this is, I'm not going to say that it's the first Sonic game in 3D

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:44.100
because, do you remember Sonic Jam?

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.100
Was that the one on the Genesis?

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:50.660
No, Sonic Jam was the Saturn release of all the Genesis and Game Gear and whatever versions.

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:51.660
Oh right.

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:56.140
And it had a middle level that was all 3D, it had different missions and stuff.

01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:02.140
There's also Sonic 3D Blast was another one.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:09.140
And the bonus stages were?

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:14.020
They were, they were in, yeah I guess they were in 3D-ish, weren't they?

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.020
Sonic 2's bonus stage was 3D.

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.060
Yeah, they went to a 3D box.

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:23.780
At any rate, you've got, you basically have your set levels and you play through certain

01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:24.780
characters.

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:28.300
Of course you've got Sonic, who is the main guy.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:34.620
You have Miles Tails Prower, which I think is cool.

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:40.700
You've got Knuckles the Echidna, and I really, really, really, really would only ever play

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:45.380
this game in Japanese because one of my favorite voice actors was Knuckles' voice actor, the

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:49.380
video I never watched, Shubushi Yuki, was possibly, and he was really cool.

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:55.260
He also was the boss, so it was like, I knew that voice!

01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:59.180
There's also Amy Rose, who beats shit with a hammer.

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:06.220
There's Big the Cat, who fishes, and oh my god, I got turned into a fishy fishy fishy.

01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:12.220
There's E-102 Gamma, which is the robot, and you can play as Super Sonic once you've finished

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:13.220
the game.

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:17.780
And of course he's all gone all super sci-aging or whatever.

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:30.140
You've also got Eggman for your bad guys, Chaos, who is a very weird little chao.

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:35.940
You've got Tikal, who is another chicken kid who keeps showing up, Zero, which is another

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:40.140
robot, and the little...

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:46.060
I'm saying chao because I played it in Japanese first, so that's how they said it.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:52.500
But they're so cool, because who remembers the VMU, right?

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:59.700
You can actually download a virtual pet, the A-Life system, and you can play chao adventure

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.700
on your VMU.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:06.780
For people who played this on the GameCube, you would actually play it on your Game Boy

01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:07.780
Advance.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:12.820
And so you can raise your stats, and you actually can go into your little chao house level or

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:17.380
whatever and play with them and see what they look like and feed them coconuts and do all

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:20.340
kinds of bizarre crap with them.

01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:29.380
Some of the other robots are in Gamma's story, which are the E-series robots.

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.220
Also Knights is in the game.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:40.340
Knights is, if you're going into the Casinopolis stage, there's actually a pinball area that's

01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:45.380
based on knights, and when you go through the little special tunnel, you're flying through

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:51.300
a knights level, which is pretty cool.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.500
So it's basically...

01:23:54.500 --> 01:24:00.780
There's some, I guess, degree of RPG element to it, in fact it's just that it really has

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:06.700
an in-depth story, and you find different things to advance your plot, and you just

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:10.780
keep moving through it, but you've got your action stages and you've got your adventure

01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:14.060
levels, which is where I'm saying the RPG part of it comes into.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:22.820
And actually, for anyone who didn't know, the working title of this was Sonic RPG, and

01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:26.540
they were pretty good together.

01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:31.900
It's really fun, it's got a fantastic story to it, we actually, when we used our VCR,

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.900
recorded a lot of playing.

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:44.500
And actually, this game received a 38 out of 40 from Famitsu, and it's really, I don't

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:51.580
think that they've been able to touch this since this one came out.

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:58.340
Sonic Avenger 2 was okay, but this one just had everything, I mean from the sound effects

01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:05.540
when you get your bubbles or your shoes, and the ending music being the same when you step

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:11.980
on the platform, being the ones that you release your little forest buddies out of, you know?

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:17.380
It's just really, really awesome.

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:18.860
See?

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:21.100
That music?

01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:29.580
You know, all of your, it's just got the feel, you know, when you break open the robot creatures

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:34.620
and little animals pop out of them, like in, you know, the old ones, it just had all those

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:37.460
touches to it, it was fantastic.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:44.740
So Sonic Adventure is definitely, definitely the game to get.

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:45.740
Looks like fun.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.300
I think I played it once, and it moved very fast.

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:52.420
It's hard to follow for me, but I'm going to give it another go.

01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:58.740
Another thing though, for people who actually like to get different collections, Sonic Adventure

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:07.040
DX Director's Cut is an enhanced version of it, and it has a mini-game collection where

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.380
you actually can get 12 different Game Gear games.

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:18.140
So you get Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Drift, Sonic Chaos, Sonic Labyrinth, Sonic the Hedgehog

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:22.300
2, Sonic Spinball, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, which is another version of Puyo

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:28.260
Puyo, Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic Drift 2, Tails Sky Patrol, Sonic Blast, and Tails the

01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:29.260
Enter.

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:30.260
Done.

01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.260
Get it?

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:37.100
All right, check it out, Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast, and didn't they remake this

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.260
game, put it out again, like on the GameCube or something?

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:40.260
That's what I was saying.

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:41.260
Oh yeah.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.260
Talking about the GameCube version.

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.260
There you go.

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.140
Okay, there you have it, your classic game of the week, and we'll have another one next

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:47.140
week for you guys.

01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:50.220
In the meantime, we're going to take a break, and when we come back, we have a little bit

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.700
of news in Part B, but mostly you guys.

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:59.020
We're going to be doing the mailbag and some quick calls tonight, and we also want you

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:01.200
guys to do this during tonight's break.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:06.580
We're going to be putting together the Orange Lounge Radio Top 3 Games of 2008.

01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:11.340
So if you want to participate, all you need to do is send in your votes right now, your

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:16.700
top 1, 2, and 3 game of 2008 using any criteria you want, and I'll compile it all together

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:22.020
during the break, and we'll have ourselves a list that myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:24.780
maybe Brad, even though he said he didn't play anything this year, maybe we can get

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:29.460
him to think of three games, and we're going to do that, as well as a list list later tonight.

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:31.540
So go ahead and send me those games, and we'll tally it up.

01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:35.020
Make sure you label it, though, 1, 2, and 3, and don't send me other private messages

01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:38.100
because they'll get lost amongst the other tabulation.

01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:47.860
So we'll do that, and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:52.780
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this December 28th of 2008 for the

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:56.920
307th episode of our show, the last show of 2008.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.900
As we get ready to move into 2009, if you can believe it, our seventh year of broadcasting.

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:06.300
I almost said podcasting, but that's not true because we didn't start podcasting until,

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.660
well, podcasting was actually around.

01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:12.460
So anyhow, we got more news to get into, just a little bit, but then we're going to get

01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:17.540
into some year-end wrap-ups and talk about our favorite games of 2008, as well as the

01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:19.300
biggest stories of the year.

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.740
Lots and lots to talk about.

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:23.140
Let's kick it off with a little bit more news from this week, though.

01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:26.940
It was a surprisingly busy week, considering it was a holiday and everything, but stuff

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.580
going on, right, Loki?

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:29.580
Yes.

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:37.020
According to CNET, it looks like Microsoft is wanting to add to the user experience and

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:43.580
design for the Zune group, and they're going to focus now on the Zune user interface, a

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:52.020
Zune PC application used to access the Zune Marketplace, and the Zune Xbox application.

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:54.980
What exactly is this application?

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:55.980
Who knows?

01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:02.500
We've already seen a couple things being demonstrated before in the past.

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:05.140
Live Anywhere comes to mind.

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:07.900
Perhaps that's going to be integrated into the Zune.

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:10.140
Maybe you'll get to see when your friends are online, whether they're playing that kind

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:11.740
of stuff.

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:15.460
Possibly even XNA games, because I know that was something that was shown off.

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.220
I'm not sure if that's been implemented yet.

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:18.860
That would be pretty awesome.

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:22.540
So some of those.

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:25.780
Very interesting, and who knows?

01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:30.740
I wouldn't doubt seeing that there may be a music download service coming at some point.

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:36.180
Since they do have the Zune Marketplace and it does happen to take Microsoft points, why

01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:44.140
not integrate that into Xbox Live and maybe allow users to be able to, say, sync the music

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:48.740
that they have on their Zune with their 360, vice versa, because it's all tied with your

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:49.740
Zune ID.

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:54.340
That might be kind of cool, especially for custom soundtracks and games and all that

01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.340
stuff.

01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.740
Might be interesting.

01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:58.400
Very interesting.

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:02.580
Also interesting, this collaboration we're hearing about, it's a rumor.

01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:04.580
Take this with a heavy grain of salt right now.

01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:06.260
But remember the game Deus Ex?

01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:07.260
Remember that game?

01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:08.260
Yeah.

01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:12.700
That was, what, they had like two games, maybe, no, I think there were two games in that series.

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:18.020
I think I remember checking it out on GameTab a long, long, long time ago.

01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:22.700
The whole series was designed by this guy, Warren Spector.

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:27.420
It's very interesting, he said at one point, I guess, what, way back in like June 2007

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:34.020
that he was working on a new project and folks would tell him that he is sold out, at least

01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:37.340
that's what hardcore gamers would say, that he's sold out.

01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:44.060
Apparently what this guy is working on, and this is from, I guess, some type of tipster

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:49.780
to the website Gamasutra, the project title that is being worked on right now is Epic

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:52.820
Mickey.

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:57.020
Apparently this game has a distinctly shadowed steampunk vibe.

01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:01.880
Now however, I don't, this is the part I don't understand, is that they are saying that maybe

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:05.460
it's talking about Mickey as in Mickey Mouse?

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:06.460
But I don't think so.

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.700
I think it's just saying the title of the project is Epic Mickey.

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.440
I think some of these other websites are jumping to conclusions and that it is actually Mickey

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.440
Mouse.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:17.540
Although I guess if you put it all together, I've sold out and the project is Epic Mickey.

01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:21.780
Could it be that there is some type of Epic Mickey Mouse game being made?

01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.780
Maybe it's Epic Fail.

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:25.740
Or Epic Mickey Rourke.

01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:28.380
My thought is though, isn't Epic Mickey Kingdom Hearts?

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:31.020
I mean, what could this guy be doing that is different than that?

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.780
Does that make sense?

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:35.780
I don't know.

01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:40.180
But apparently it goes all the way back to referencing something that, you know, the

01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:46.460
rumor guy on Electronic Gaming Monthly had said that apparently it actually ties into

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.460
that Specter is working on, in fact, a Disney product.

01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:52.740
So that's what kind of all, where it all ties together.

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:53.740
Very interesting.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:58.100
And that apparently it could be actually a game where Mickey does battle with Mario.

01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.460
Isn't that weird?

01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:00.460
That would be stupid.

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.980
That sounds like a fanboy, something they wrote out on paper.

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:03.980
I don't know.

01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:05.940
Mickey is never going to do battle with Mario.

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:07.860
Well again, how is that really different from Kingdom Hearts?

01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:09.580
Does that make sense?

01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:12.620
Yeah, but what if, say, yeah, I don't know.

01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:16.440
Maybe they're getting greedy and they just want, you know, their own Kingdom Hearts where

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.940
they get all the profits.

01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.940
GSCCA says Mushroom Kingdom Hearts?

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:21.940
It's a nice thought.

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:25.100
I mean, like, maybe it's a Nintendo Wii game.

01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:27.540
I mean, you want to talk about selling out?

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:30.980
This guy's making a game that involves Mickey and Mario on the Nintendo Wii.

01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:34.140
Oh my god, could they do a Mario RPG too?

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.380
Now we're talking.

01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.380
Now we're talking.

01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:39.780
But they can't do it without Square Enix, sorry, because that would be epic fail.

01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:44.340
Well maybe it will be for the Nintendo Wii what Sony has for Kingdom Hearts, if that

01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:45.340
makes sense.

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:46.340
I don't know.

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.900
It could be interesting.

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:50.660
Could be interesting.

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:56.660
But I think there's a lot of in-between-the-line reading going on in this particular story.

01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:00.060
So I think we ought to just wait until this guy decides to tell us what he's working on.

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:01.060
Could be.

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.060
Alright.

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:06.820
Game Guru in chat says Mario and Mickey at the Olympic Games?

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:07.820
Could be, could be.

01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:12.300
Hey, we want to take a moment here to look back on the year 2008 and our favorite games

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:16.740
of the year 2008, and we've actually kind of combined it, or we'll be combining it here

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:21.900
with votes that you submitted during the break here live in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com.

01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:23.620
We've closed the polls there.

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:28.940
And now we're going to add to it our favorite games of 2008, using any criteria we want.

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:31.580
That's why we don't like to say the top games of 2008.

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:35.980
No, they're our favorite games of 2008, using any criteria we want.

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:38.780
So if we want to put some game you think is crappy on there, too bad.

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.580
It's our favorite games of 2008, and then I'll let you know what collectively is in

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.380
all our listenership we came up with.

01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:50.340
Dark Sakura, what was your number three favorite- how appropriate this music comes on, just

01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:51.340
the right time.

01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:56.780
What would you say was your number three favorite video game in the year 2008?

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:57.780
Rock Band 2.

01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:58.780
Rock Band 2.

01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:02.020
Any particular reason why?

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:04.460
Do I need to name them all?

01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:06.420
Really?

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:11.420
It's just such a massive library.

01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:16.700
Having the different instruments and everything, even on top of that, you could import your

01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:19.300
list from the first Guitar Hero and it would all work.

01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:20.300
You mean Rock Band?

01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:21.300
Rock Band.

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:22.300
You know what I mean?

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.300
That's right.

01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.300
This brings me to my next point.

01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:26.700
The one thing that it did not have going for it is the guitars.

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:32.140
The guitars suck, and I would only use the Guitar Hero guitars.

01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:38.380
This is a game that narrowly missed being on my list, but I love this game.

01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.780
What did you think, though, compared to the first game?

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:45.100
At first, when I first sat down with Rock Band 2, I was kind of like, eh, this feels

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:46.100
like Rock Band 1.5.

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:48.860
I think that might be part of the reason it didn't make my top three is because I do feel

01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:53.980
like it was an upgrade of what I played last year, but there is a lot of new, cool stuff.

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:54.980
You know what I mean?

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:55.980
There is enough.

01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:00.580
The multiplayer, when you make your band, you can actually save your character per your

01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:06.180
account, and I think that's a lot better, because it was really irritating going back

01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:10.820
to playing the first Rock Band over at my friend's house and having to save my character

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:12.980
on her profile.

01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:13.980
It was really irritating.

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:14.980
Okay.

01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:17.660
Loki, what was your number three favorite game of the year?

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:19.900
Yeah, that's tough.

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.780
Let me narrow it down.

01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:25.100
Let's see, and we're going to try to be a little different here.

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:32.780
Lost Odyssey, because Lost Odyssey this year was the only game that I feel is as close

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:39.180
to Final Fantasy as we're going to have in a while, until Final Fantasy XIII, and people

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:43.980
thought maybe Last Remnant, maybe some of these other games that had come out, no.

01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:48.260
Lost Odyssey is the closest thing you're going to get to Final Fantasy XIII until XIII comes

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.260
out.

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:50.700
It plays exactly like a Final Fantasy game.

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:54.900
And just even apart from the Final Fantasy series, it was a good game with a good story.

01:35:54.900 --> 01:36:00.140
Another game that narrowly missed my top three, that I thought was still incredibly good.

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:02.060
And again, I need to go back and finish.

01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:03.060
Maybe part of the reason I didn't.

01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:04.660
Yes, I need to finish it too.

01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:06.780
I'm only a little ways into it.

01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:07.780
Bradley, I have no idea.

01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:08.780
Did you make a top three list?

01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:10.780
I don't know if you played enough games this year or what.

01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:14.500
I actually thought of three games that came out this year that I actually played.

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.500
Excellent!

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.500
What was your number three pick, Bradley?

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:17.500
I played only three games.

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:20.300
I think I bought one or two other that came out this year, but I didn't get around to

01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.300
playing them.

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:22.300
That's all right.

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:27.420
So, number three, at the bottom of the list I played this year, but it's not bad, but

01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:31.380
it's just DDR, DDRX.

01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:36.220
And I actually only played like a few hours of it, and the stories are weird.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:39.380
Whoa, they put stories in DDR?

01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:45.820
There's this weird thing, they have the different stories for characters.

01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:49.460
The first two, I think there's one or two characters that are unlocked at the beginning,

01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:55.340
which is, I think it's Emi, and there's a new guy named Zero, who's like, the Zero guy,

01:36:55.340 --> 01:37:01.460
he's just like the stoic sort of guy, he doesn't say very much, he's kind of, ugh, whatever.

01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:06.540
Sort of like a weird Bishonen looking kind of guy, he's just like feh, because they do

01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:10.660
this little story thing where they do something weird with each character, and then they do

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:15.620
a dance battle, either do a dance battle with somebody or just, oh, show off your moves.

01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:17.820
Sounds too much like you got served to me.

01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:19.860
Yeah, it's kind of silly.

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:24.260
Alright, well you know what though, I'm glad DDR is represented somewhere on the list,

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:31.380
because we did start up as a Bimani based radio station, so why not?

01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:35.180
My number three game that I would pick on the list of the top three games that were

01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:41.260
released in 2008, even though it's funny because I just said I didn't put a game on there because

01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:46.540
it felt like a remake of an old game, my number three game on my list is a remake, but it's

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:49.940
a damn good one, and it's one that needed to be brought to the forefront because too

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:53.940
many people overlooked it the first time it came out, and that is Res HD, is my third

01:37:53.940 --> 01:38:01.780
favorite game of 2008, because I just think this game is an experience.

01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:03.900
It is, god, I just love this game.

01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:08.860
Even though at its premise it's a relatively simple rail shooter, I think just turning

01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:15.100
off all the lights inside the living room, turning on this game on your big HD TV, putting

01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:23.980
those controllers on your lap or on your back or whatever they recommend you do, it's just

01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:24.980
awesome.

01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:29.720
It's a totally experience that I just don't get with a lot of other games, and so I really

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:36.020
love Res, so yes, make all the vibration jokes you want, but yes, Res HD is my number three

01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:39.300
favorite game of 2008.

01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:42.320
Dark Sakura, your number two favorite game of 2008.

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:47.180
My number two game would be Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:49.980
Ah, any particular reason why?

01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:55.860
Dude, it's freaking, I only really played as Ken and Jun because I'm the big gachamon

01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:03.740
fangirl, but it's really cool, it had actually so many different touches that if you were

01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:10.440
fans of the old Tatsunoko series, it's just like big fangasm right then and there.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:16.220
So many good touches, except for the Happy Thumb Ball of Doom, I hated the Happy Thumb

01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:21.860
Ball of Doom, but the rest of it was pretty freaking fun, and it's just like playing Marvel

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:49.460
vs. Capcom in its control, it was really cool.

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:52.940
The characters we knew were going to be good, but you know you've heard of projects like

01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:56.780
these and you go, oh boy, it's kind of like games based off movies, you're always kind

01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:00.340
of like, oh boy, these are going to kind of stink, but the game was surprisingly decent,

01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:01.660
so I can see that.

01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.340
Loki, your number two game of the year.

01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:09.200
My number two game of the year, it's tough.

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:16.300
I would, I guess I'm just going to have to go with Saints Row 2.

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:17.300
Saints Row 2.

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:26.740
I love my sandbox games, and you know, unfortunately I can't add Left 4 Dead or Fallout 3, I'm

01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:33.020
not going to talk about Fable 2, and oh man, there's other games I would like to play,

01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:39.820
or I'd like to have on my list here, but Saints Row 2 was actually, I thought, a little bit

01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:45.140
better than, or more fun for me than Granthathot of 4, even though I still play Granthathot

01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:50.980
of 4 today, but, and that is pretty fun, especially now that I can mod it, but it was an overall

01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:55.220
fun game, and I really can't wait for the next one to come out.

01:40:55.220 --> 01:41:02.020
Saints Row 3, in 2010 maybe, alright, awesome, we know you never shut up about that game

01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:05.580
on the show, so it's no surprise that's showing up on your list, but that's cool, sandbox

01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:07.380
games can be a lot of fun.

01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:09.520
Bradley, number two, for you.

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:16.940
This game had the unfortunate circumstance that I picked up Zelda Phantom Hourglass and

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.420
didn't get back to it, but, since it's the other game that I played this year, it's Sonic

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:26.860
Chronicles, the Dark Brotherhood, and I only got to like, maybe the third mission, but

01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:37.300
it's pretty fun, but Zelda just took over, so, but it's not too bad.

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:43.660
Alright, Sonic Chronicles, what every Sonic fan should, you know, be checking out probably,

01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:44.660
right?

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:45.660
Maybe?

01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:46.660
I don't know.

01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:54.100
Alright, my number two game that I put on my list was a game that came out for a relatively

01:41:54.100 --> 01:42:01.020
low price, and was, again, it was an experience, and it was also on Xbox Live Arcade, it was

01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:05.700
a good year for Xbox Live Arcade, Braid was my number two pick of game I enjoyed this

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:08.220
year.

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:14.100
You know, that whole games as art thing, I mean, the game just moves like a painting,

01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:22.240
has a surprisingly great story with depth, and is a puzzler game that's got a pretty

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.300
interesting twist on the whole usual 2D platformer.

01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:28.580
I had a lot of fun with it, and it wasn't something, you know, it felt very rewarding

01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:33.380
when you actually beat a puzzle, even though it was tempting to use walkthroughs, if you

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:37.180
stick with it, it's going to be very rewarding to beat some of the puzzles.

01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:41.140
So I picked Braid, because I thought that game was great.

01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:45.820
Alright, number one favorite game all freaking year, Dark Sakura.

01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:47.900
I'd say Castlevania, Order of Ecclesia.

01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:48.900
Oh!

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:54.800
It's been pissing me the hell off, but I've been having the most fun with it, so it definitely,

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:58.940
it gets back to, I think, what made Symphony of the Night fun, so.

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:00.580
Alright.

01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:03.620
Even though that game frustrates me to no end, it was pretty cool.

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:05.780
Alright, Loki.

01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:10.420
Your number one favorite game all freaking year.

01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:14.620
You know, I'd normally go with Grand Theft Auto IV, because, you know, it's Grand Theft

01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:20.200
Auto, but actually, I'm going to have to say Little Big Planet, just because of, it was

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.200
just a fun game.

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:26.140
I mean, it's hard to really pick one game, but Little Big Planet, this is definitely

01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:31.460
a game I could see myself playing, you know, months from now, so, out to go with Little

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:32.460
Big Planet.

01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:33.460
Alright.

01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.700
Little Big Planet.

01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:39.260
Lots to do in Little Big Planet, lots of replayability value.

01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:43.420
Bradley, your number one favorite game of 2008.

01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:48.620
And it's actually not even, maybe, not exactly a game, but it has games in it, I've learned

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:54.180
that it's what I actually have on my DS right now, playing, it's My Japanese Coach, and

01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:58.460
I'll let it speak for itself.

01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:07.700
Hey, I hope you heard that.

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:12.720
That's what I love about this show, you really can use any criteria you want, so if you want

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:16.220
to put My Japanese Coach as your number one game of the year, you go ahead.

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:22.500
Yeah, that's good for learning, and I actually recommend it if you want to learn Japanese.

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:27.140
If you're just starting out, you probably want to have some help, or get into a class,

01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:31.740
but this would also be good to help along in, especially if it's good if you've forgotten

01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:35.880
a lot and need to get back in, get your skills back up.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:39.460
A shout out for the educational games, there you go.

01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:43.620
Alright, my number one game of the year, you know what, you've been listening to this show

01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:47.020
long enough, you know me well enough, what do you think?

01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:49.380
My number one game of the year, this shouldn't be hard.

01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:51.820
Super Metroid.

01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:54.300
Maybe about 15 years ago, yes.

01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:56.140
Or number one game of all time, maybe.

01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:59.020
Loki, I know you've got to know.

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.200
Sing Star Abba.

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.020
That's a damn good pick, and I am very tempted to put that on my list, but no, I tried to

01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:11.700
be halfway serious with this list, and as much as I love Sing Star Abba for its nostalgia

01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:16.500
value for me, the game itself needs some improvement.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:18.400
But Loki, try again.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:20.720
If I'm being serious, what do you think the number one?

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:21.720
Little Big Planet.

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:25.900
You're absolutely right, Little Big Planet is my number one favorite game of 2008, because

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:30.420
I think this game is amazing.

01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:35.740
Despite all the hubble we had about the moderation that went on earlier this year, I mean, God,

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:41.260
I wouldn't even need half of that, and those user-created levels in the game itself, even

01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:46.260
by itself, is amazing, and I'm having a wonderful time with it, and the potential that this

01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:51.420
game has for expansion is awesome, and now that they gave Sackboy a gun, it's even better,

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:55.100
and this game is amazing.

01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:57.900
So I love Little Big Planet, it's my number one game of the year.

01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:04.300
Now, we put our votes together with you guys in the chat room, and kind of some surprising

01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:05.300
results.

01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:11.100
If we were to put together, you guys had picks all up and down the spectrum, and all throughout

01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:14.540
the spectrum of gaming, like you probably named like 40 different games between you

01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:16.180
guys.

01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:19.840
Here's the interesting thing, if we were to put our list together with the chat room,

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:24.520
there would be a tie for the number one game of 2008, with Little Big Planet, because Loki

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:27.900
and I naming it as number one game of the year probably helps, but get this, you know

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:29.020
what the other number one game would be?

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:33.180
It would be one none of us named, Mega Man 9, would be the game of the year.

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:35.180
That's worthy.

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:40.380
That retro throwback, and even Little Big Planet has a little bit of that sense in it,

01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:47.020
the whole 2D platformer with it, definitely our fans are big on the throwbacks.

01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:52.460
You see, also surprising what would come in second place, kind of some ties all around

01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:58.260
here, we have Left 4 Dead, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, and Rock Band 2.

01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:02.020
So even though somebody named Rock Band 2, nobody named the other ones, and those were

01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:06.300
very well loved amongst our listeners, Brawl, probably the Wii title to have this year,

01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:10.520
and Left 4 Dead, which as far as shooters go has been pretty amazing.

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.660
And then third place would be yet another one we didn't even name, Fallout 3.

01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:17.860
But obviously the topic of that's come up earlier in the show, and at least for me that's

01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:21.980
one of those games that I'll get to it when it comes down in price a little later on after

01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:25.960
I finish these other games I want to play.

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.660
So there it is, your favorite games of 2008.

01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:33.700
Very interesting to see some of the other things that people picked.

01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:39.260
Castle Crashers, DJ Max, Wii Sports, somebody put in their list, even two years later shows

01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:43.860
you the staying power of a game like that, Gears of War 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo

01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:53.460
HD Remix, Fable 2, Castle Crashers, Tomb Raider, the new one, Bionic Commander Rearmed, Chrono

01:47:53.460 --> 01:48:02.660
Trigger DS, Bioshock, Mario Kart Wii, NHL 2009, the list goes on and on.

01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:04.840
Very nice.

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:07.100
Pretty good year for games overall?

01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:08.700
I would say so.

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:12.300
I would say yes unless you're the Nintendo Wii, I think the Nintendo Wii had maybe one

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:17.180
or two great games on it, and the rest was shovelware in my opinion.

01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:20.380
Loki, was it a good year for games in 2008?

01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:21.940
It was okay.

01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:22.940
It was okay.

01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:26.420
All right, let's see if it was a good year for The Mailbag.

01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:30.940
Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and we

01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:35.660
read some of your mail right here on this program in a little segment we appropriately

01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:44.540
call The Mailbag.

01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:46.980
Well we've only got one email.

01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:47.980
Just one.

01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:48.980
Fail.

01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:51.180
Well, it's a decent one though.

01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:56.300
Hey OLR, season's greetings and all the rest, excellent job with the show, I really enjoy

01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:57.300
it.

01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:58.300
Thank you.

01:48:58.300 --> 01:48:59.620
I have a small question about reviews.

01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:03.020
I know you guys review games on your own show quite frequently.

01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:05.660
Depends on if they suck, how much they suck, etc.

01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:09.580
I must confess that I'm a bit of a casual gamer and also a poor college student, so

01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:12.580
don't have any money to pick up every game you guys review.

01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:17.340
However, when I do decide to pick up a game, I usually look at games that came out quasi

01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:21.740
recently and take into account what you guys said about it.

01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:25.540
That being said, I can't go through every episode to find the exact spot where you reviewed

01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:26.540
a certain game.

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:31.620
I poked around the forums a bit, and I can't find a lot of places where you reviewed games.

01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:35.020
I know this might take up a little more of your time, but wouldn't it be cool if you

01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:40.100
had a place where you just had a little snippet of what you said about a game, gave it a thumbs

01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:45.460
up or thumbs down, and limited this to only the popular or big title games that came out.

01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:49.060
For example, I remember this guy recently liked Little Big Planet, but I can't remember

01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:51.580
what Dark Sakura said about Animal Crossing.

01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:54.200
It was the same, by the way.

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:58.260
Even if not all of you played the game, I still value each of your opinions because

01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:00.500
you guys never seem to leave me astray.

01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:04.940
I'm not proposing an entire archive of what everyone nitpicked about every single aspect

01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:05.940
of each game.

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:09.940
I'm just looking for an easy, and preferably online, way to find out if you approved of

01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:12.380
a certain game before I go and get it.

01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:13.380
Just something to think about.

01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:38.180
I hope your holidays are awesome, Amplitude.

01:50:38.180 --> 01:51:05.940
Well I will tell you this, that Sauce actually has a review blog that we've talked about

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:15.140
some reviews on there before, but it's at Avengers-Tower.com, I think it is?

01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:19.340
And she puts up a lot of reviews there, and I was actually kind of thinking about getting

01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:26.920
back into blogging some game related stuff, since I'm actually playing things a bit more,

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:33.120
and actually since I'm chatting with her, she suggested get a Gamefly account too.

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:37.620
If you guys know anyone who is really good at website design, and I mean really serious

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:38.620
inquiries on me-

01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:39.620
Oh, there's no Dash in that, by the way.

01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:40.620
Oh.

01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:41.620
Just Avengers Tower.

01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:42.620
Please send them my way.

01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:46.340
And I'm not talking about hosting or admin, because we have a guy who does that who is

01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:50.900
amazing, but I'm talking about the design itself of a website and being able to run

01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:51.900
it.

01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:57.120
I would even be willing to throw money out there if it's not too extreme, so get in touch

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:58.120
with me.

01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:00.780
A lot of times, and maybe you've tried to before, but it fell through the cracks because

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:04.580
you get a lot of freaking spam, but I'll try to keep my eye out over the next week.

01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:11.920
If you have ideas on how we can get OLR's website functional for types of requests like

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:17.140
this, I would love to hear it, because unfortunately, with a full-time job and school and stuff,

01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:18.140
we got no time.

01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:20.620
Yeah, we were using WinMatter before, or using-

01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:23.220
We're still using PHP Nuke, and it's just an old system.

01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:26.620
No, I meant for our old blog that we used to have.

01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:27.620
Old blog?

01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:29.820
Yeah, remember the blog that we had up way back in the day?

01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:30.820
God, yeah.

01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:33.820
I think it was called GrayMatter or something like that.

01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:35.020
That was old.

01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:37.780
We could probably throw up a WordPress easy, but I don't know.

01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:40.860
WordPress was what we used.

01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:45.340
We could just try reviving that too.

01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:48.860
The website as it is today has just kind of looked the same for the past four years.

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:53.060
I'm ready to nuke it and try something else, kind of like how they blew up the Stardust

01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.060
for building a new hotel.

01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:55.060
PHP Nuke!

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:56.060
Yeah, exactly.

01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:57.060
Nuke!

01:52:57.060 --> 01:52:59.780
Explore the nuke in PHP Nuke.

01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:02.180
We don't need help in hosting or any of that stuff.

01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:05.180
We got that covered because Jason's the man, but we just need help in writing.

01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:08.820
We just need a website that looks less- Yeah.

01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:09.860
Less.

01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:11.640
Our strength is radio, guys.

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:13.580
That's the thing you got to learn.

01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:15.420
Radio is what we've done for seven years, not website design.

01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:19.300
Hey, I can update PHP BB, so don't worry about that.

01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:21.300
I did my own board.

01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:22.300
Awesome.

01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:29.260
That's- I'm going to give it a refresh just to see, but you know what?

01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:30.260
No.

01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.260
All right.

01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:32.260
That's all right.

01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:33.260
How dare they?

01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:38.340
Probably because I've been very behind on updating the podcast again, and you know,

01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:39.340
oops.

01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:44.780
I will resolve in the new year to get us all caught up and current again.

01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:46.740
So hooray.

01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:50.460
Let's move on with a couple more news stories, just a couple, and then we're going to do

01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:51.460
listless tonight.

01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:52.460
We haven't done listless in forever.

01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:54.420
This will be fun.

01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:56.420
Listless tonight.

01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:59.660
Top three news stories of 2008.

01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:01.460
Top three news stories will be tonight's listless.

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:02.460
It'll be fun.

01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:05.140
It'll be quick, too, because there's only three of us, and then we've got Skype, too.

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:06.140
Don't worry.

01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:07.140
We'll have Skype.

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:09.140
We'll have plenty of time for that.

01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:10.820
Lucky news.

01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:11.880
Yes.

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:18.300
So there was a game that was coming out, a RPG called Cryon that looked pretty cool.

01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:25.520
Unfortunately, the development company AQ Interactive that was behind it decided, well,

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:32.220
they're just not going to release it because apparently due to the financial situation

01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:39.220
that they're in and that kind of stuff and their forecasts that they're going to not

01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:45.980
really continue development on it, the current market environment, and the forecasts for

01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:52.100
the future, and of course they apologized to everybody that was waiting for the release.

01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:53.100
But too bad.

01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:54.100
Yeah.

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.100
I think this was a game that they were showing off.

01:54:55.100 --> 01:55:01.980
I want to say either the very first year of 360 came out or maybe a little bit after.

01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:14.340
It's basically, what was it, a team that composed of Miss Walker and Artoon.

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.020
What's Miss Walker been working on lately?

01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:18.500
Are they doing Lost Odyssey 2 and Blue Dragon 2?

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:20.100
Well, there's a Blue Dragon DS game.

01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:21.100
Oh, yeah.

01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:22.100
That's right.

01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:23.980
I think there's some other Miss Walker game that's coming out.

01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.940
There were about a few things I remember.

01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:29.100
They've already confirmed a sequel to Lost Odyssey, though, right?

01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:30.100
I don't know.

01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:31.100
I think they did.

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:32.100
I think they did.

01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:33.100
We'll see.

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.100
Hey, follow up.

01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:36.500
Remember last week we just had depression upon depression?

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:41.900
All these studios were closing left and right, and some of them were rumor status, and one

01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.700
of those was free radical.

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:49.700
Unfortunately, it has been confirmed that as of December 31st, free radical is going

01:55:49.700 --> 01:55:52.540
to be downsizing significantly.

01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:56.260
Seventy-five percent of its workforce, 140 employees.

01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:00.140
That means only 40 people will be left, and they're selling the business.

01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:05.300
There are some other companies out there that are apparently interested in picking up this

01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:11.160
company, but who knows who is going to snap up this company yet?

01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:12.420
But that's a bummer.

01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:18.380
140 employees get laid off right at the end of the year during the holidays.

01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:19.500
Damn this economy.

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:21.180
Damn it.

01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:22.180
So there it is.

01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:25.540
The free radical is closing its doors.

01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:33.120
Well, just the countless news upon news articles of studios shutting their doors is just one

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.460
of the big things that happened in 2008, but we thought we would take a look tonight at

01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:42.440
some of the top stories of 2008, the way that only we can do it here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:48.580
in a segment we call Listless.

01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:49.580
That's right.

01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:55.860
On Orange Lounge Radio, we do a segment called Listless where we invite the host to submit

01:56:55.860 --> 01:57:01.780
their top three, and then we have the chat room vote on the list that is prepared and

01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:07.500
come up with the ultimate list, and today's topic is the top three stories of 2008.

01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.340
Now what's interesting tonight is that I don't believe Bradley is going to be able to participate

01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:14.620
because I don't think he's been following enough stories this year to tell us he's shaking

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:15.620
his head no.

01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:20.220
It's just dark soccer on myself and Loki to have lists out there, so because there's only

01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:24.340
so many of us participating tonight, there will be no elimination round in tonight's

01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:25.340
Listless.

01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:29.580
So, it's an open table for anything you want to submit to the list tonight.

01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:32.700
And remember, you guys can use any criteria you want.

01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:34.560
That's part of what makes Orange Lounge Radio unique.

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:41.500
We don't profess to be the experts or the analysts and all that crap.

01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:42.500
They get paid money.

01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:43.500
We don't.

01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:44.860
So we can use whatever criteria we want.

01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:49.700
So that being said, dark soccer, biggest news story of 2008, number three, what would you

01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:50.700
say?

01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:55.220
The asshole getting smacked down.

01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:57.180
About fucking time.

01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:01.180
He who shall not be named loses his license to practice law in Florida, correct?

01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:02.180
Yes.

01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:03.180
Alright.

01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:07.500
That was a pretty monumentous occasion that involved confetti being tossed and hurrays

01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:08.500
everywhere.

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:09.500
Alright.

01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:12.260
DJ Dark Knight says, let the chatters kick one out.

01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:13.260
I don't know.

01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:16.540
Should we let the chatters maybe put, like, one thing on the list so we have a nice even

01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:17.540
ten?

01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:18.540
Sure.

01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:19.540
Alright.

01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:20.540
I'll do this.

01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:23.620
At a certain time, I'm going to open up the Skype line and we'll let you guys put one

01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:24.860
thing on the list.

01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:25.860
Alright.

01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:28.740
Loki, you're number three.

01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:33.260
Oh man, that's tough.

01:58:33.260 --> 01:58:41.780
I guess because we talked a lot about it.

01:58:41.780 --> 01:58:45.740
I guess the, it'd be funny, Rock Revolution, not me announcing that they're doing Rock

01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:50.300
Revolution, or was that, no that was actually the year before last, or was that this E3?

01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:52.300
I can't remember.

01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:57.180
This E3 was the one where they really botched it publicly, you might remember, so maybe

01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:58.180
you want to use that.

01:58:58.180 --> 01:58:59.180
Take that off.

01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:00.180
Take that off.

01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:01.180
Oh, no.

01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:02.180
I got it.

01:59:02.180 --> 01:59:07.700
Nintendo fucking up their E3 press conference.

01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:09.700
Care to elaborate?

01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:14.260
Yes, their demonstration of Wii music and how it butchered the Super Mario Brothers

01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:24.220
theme, stories about snowboarding and Sun's, I guess, holiday cards or stuff like that,

01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:28.980
and what was the other thing that they showed that was really crappy?

01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:31.620
Oh, Animal Crossing and how it wasn't different.

01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:35.420
Yeah, Game Guru in the chat room asked a question a lot of people are going to ask you.

01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:36.420
What fuck up?

01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:38.500
Some people would say they did not fuck up.

01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:42.420
Okay, disappointing showing at E3.

01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:44.500
Clearly they had the worst press conference.

01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:50.460
They were supposed to make this big splash to come back for ignoring the core gamer,

01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:54.620
and they ignored the core gamer, yeah.

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:55.620
Alright.

01:59:55.620 --> 01:59:58.900
Alright, we said anything you want?

01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:01.020
Tiger Claus says, how about the drummer pretending to drum?

02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:04.100
So you do have some allies in your corner there.

02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:07.940
My number three that I would put on the list, I would say the story, and I don't know if

02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:11.500
you remember this, but part of the reason I'm putting it on the list is because of the

02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:16.180
endless lulls that it brought us on this show, but do you remember when a website called

02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:21.940
WhatTheyPlay.com ran a poll, and this poll discovered that people out there are more

02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:29.580
offended by sex and gay kissing than multiple uses of the word fuck and disembodied heads?

02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:34.940
Remember, gay kissing is more offensive than a severed head in a video game, so I believe

02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:41.260
that whole asshattery, we will call the WhatTheyPlay.com asshattery, even though I feel really terrible

02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:45.540
because I'm sure that website is like a fine website, it's just the users of that website

02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:54.060
are asshats, the WhatTheyPlay.com asshattery is my third top news story of 2008, because

02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:57.900
I think it really ties into a lot of these other types of censorship stories and even

02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:01.580
asshole losing his license and all that stuff, I think it all kind of ties together.

02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:06.660
It just really shows you the general public and how our views of the world can be very

02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:08.060
fucked up sometimes.

02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:09.060
Thank you.

02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:15.540
All right, that takes us to our number twos, Dark Saga.

02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:23.540
Number two will be Stephen Colbert and Rock Band.

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:25.780
That was pretty epic to have Stephen Colbert and Rock Band.

02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:27.260
That was fucking epic.

02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:35.140
You can actually add Stephen Colbert and Jonathan Coulton in Rock Band.

02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:36.140
Have yourself a party.

02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:37.140
Hell yeah.

02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:42.460
All right, that's right, Charlene was available in Rock Band for free, so it's free Stephen

02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:43.940
Colbert and Rock Band.

02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:45.460
Yeah, even better.

02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:47.140
Twice as amazing.

02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:49.660
So we've got a free write-off of them, huh?

02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:53.140
And easiest way to get some of those achievements because the song is so short.

02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:55.340
Just want to point that out.

02:01:55.340 --> 02:02:00.460
Loki, your number two top news story of 2008.

02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:03.780
Just because it was funny to make fun of how ridiculous everything was getting.

02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:06.260
The Little Big Planet controversy.

02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:13.180
Seriously, a song with lyrics that most people won't understand, can't possibly get offended

02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:14.180
by them.

02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:15.700
What was up with that?

02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:19.460
Like seriously, the guy had won Grammys and does this stuff all his time in his albums

02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:23.020
and nobody had ever had a problem with it before and even the guy who complained about

02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:28.620
it was like, I didn't mean to like recall the game, you could have just like patched

02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:29.620
it out.

02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:30.620
Panic!

02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:31.620
Panic!

02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:32.620
Panic!

02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:33.620
Panic!

02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:34.620
Panic!

02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:38.220
This is the new motto at Sony, whenever we talk about Sony headquarters, panic, panic,

02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:39.220
panic!

02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:40.220
Eat crayon, panic!

02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:43.620
That's right, the crayon eating leads to panicking.

02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:48.540
Do you think that maybe there's some chemical in like the crayon that causes people to panic?

02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:50.540
Been dying there before.

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:57.140
Alright, my number two was going to also be the news story about Nintendo burning their

02:02:57.140 --> 02:02:59.060
hardcore gamers at E3.

02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:08.180
But since Loki stole that, I will say the news that E for All got canned and old E3

02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:12.540
is coming back because I think it goes to show a lot of people said, it wouldn't work,

02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:17.500
it wouldn't work and as much as they're trying to say, well you know we tried something different

02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:23.820
and it didn't work, so old E3 is returning is my number two story of 2008.

02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:26.140
Old E3 returning, bye bye E for All.

02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:32.140
Where did E for All not work out, do you guys think, everything?

02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:38.300
I think that it was a good concept but because there was already this expectation of what

02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:46.940
was there before, it really did rub raw with a lot in the community and really I think

02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:55.220
a lot of the hype was really really brought up at the big E3 orgy, I'm sorry it was the

02:03:55.220 --> 02:04:00.780
orgy of game, so that really actually cut down a lot of advertising for them I thought.

02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:05.660
They had a Target booth where you could buy games, oh my god, where will we find a Target

02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:11.900
on, I don't know, anywhere in the United States, oh wait no they're everywhere that's right,

02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:16.540
so yes of course you need to go to E for All to go buy your games.

02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:22.380
Gangru wants to point out in chat that Capcom he believes was the worst at E3, at least

02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:27.820
Nintendo talked about actual games, that was a good point, Capcom got up there and sucked

02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:34.900
their own dicks for an hour basically is what they did, which you think would be an impressive

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:37.140
thing to watch but in fact it was really boring.

02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:42.100
It would be like if I went to an old folks home and talked about how awesome games are,

02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:46.820
they would probably boo me off the stage and go to sleep.

02:04:46.820 --> 02:04:51.060
Same thing was happening with the casual game stuff, I know that a lot of people like casual

02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:56.220
games, which is great, but casual gamers don't really need to be up to date on what's coming

02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:58.580
out because they're casual gamers.

02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:03.260
They don't care about street dates, they don't care about having to play stuff right away,

02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:07.500
they're casual, they're like hey cool, this game's awesome, it just came out, maybe I'll

02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.140
give it a shot.

02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:16.300
I don't know, it's just the core audience is what drives the consoles and you have to

02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:22.540
appease the core audience and then get some more people in to become your core audience.

02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:25.300
Gameguru says E3 is for the casual gamer and movie lover now.

02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:29.140
I don't know, do you think having to go back to the old way somewhat, I mean we say the

02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:32.580
old way although they say we're going to cap it at 40,000, they say they're going to make

02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:38.060
it easier for podcasters to get in and I'm saying I'll believe it when I see it.

02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:51.740
My podcasters, if you're an IGN podcaster, or people that do an incredible job at marketing

02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:55.660
their podcasts, there's people out there that do a much better job at marketing themselves

02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:57.460
and their hobby than we do, honestly.

02:05:57.460 --> 02:06:01.180
This is something we've done for LoLs on a Sunday night for seven years, but some people

02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:04.740
have really made a life out of it out there in the indie podcasting community, so I'm

02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:07.060
not knocking that, props to them.

02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:11.780
Do what you love, but I think they'll have an easier time getting into E3, but we will

02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:15.620
still have to ask for handouts on the street corner.

02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:20.860
All right, I promised that we would allow a listener to add something to the list, so

02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:22.260
we're going to the Skype line right now.

02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:23.260
Who's on the line?

02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.260
This is Aki Ripper.

02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:25.260
Aki Ripper!

02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:28.260
How are you doing, my friend?

02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:29.860
I'm doing just fine.

02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:30.860
All right.

02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:36.300
With the small, tiny detail that what the hell do I have to add to this, LoL?

02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:40.900
Well, you got through.

02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:45.300
You called when I said to call in chat, and I said a chat room person could add one item

02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:46.300
to the list.

02:06:46.300 --> 02:06:48.340
So we are about to start our number ones.

02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:52.940
So Aki Ripper, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?

02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:54.540
Any criteria you want.

02:06:54.540 --> 02:07:03.260
Well, the only thing I can think of at the straight really is the dissemination of who

02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:05.660
dare, that one who shall not be named.

02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:08.780
So I fail, but automatic.

02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:09.780
Sorry.

02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:11.500
Well, yeah, and that's already on the list.

02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:13.860
So you're not going to try and add something new to the list?

02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:19.580
What would number two be?

02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:20.780
I really got to be.

02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:24.660
I am so really behind.

02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:25.660
Gua!

02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:29.200
Pardon me, I just failed.

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:33.580
Was there a game called Gua that was released this year?

02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:34.580
Guar is a band.

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:35.580
I know that.

02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:39.140
All right, Aki Ripper, I'll have to let you go.

02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:40.340
Call back later.

02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:41.340
Later.

02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:43.380
All right.

02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:44.380
People so excited to call in.

02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:45.980
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:07:45.980 --> 02:07:46.980
Who's this?

02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:47.980
Hey, it's Jason.

02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:48.980
Guess what, Jason?

02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:52.660
I turned on my volume and was like, wait, is that me?

02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:57.140
The call before you, Jason, tried to name something that was already on the list because

02:07:57.140 --> 02:07:58.140
of the delay.

02:07:58.140 --> 02:07:59.140
Yeah, who shall not be named.

02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:00.260
That's what I was just trying to turn down.

02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:03.420
I know, because they're in a foreign country and all.

02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:06.540
It takes like an hour for the delay and everything, yet they were able to call in.

02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:11.860
No, but I reminded them that it didn't, okay, sorry, technical difficulties.

02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:12.860
That's right.

02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:13.860
Jason, that's good news for you.

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:15.980
That means you can put on whatever you want onto the list.

02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:20.300
So what do you think was the top news story of 2008 in gaming?

02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:24.060
I'm going to be a little bit egotistical with this one because of how everything went out.

02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:28.420
The new Metal Gear Solid will be an iPhone game.

02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:31.700
Oh, something a little recently here.

02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:32.700
Okay.

02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:34.180
Jason, I think this is such a big freaking deal.

02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:38.820
Give me one moment so I'm not echoing all over the place.

02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:41.260
You sound fine to us here in the studio, just so you know.

02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:42.620
Yeah, you said that, but...

02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:46.380
You sound like a tin can, but you sound fine.

02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:51.540
I chose that simply for the fact that people went absolutely crazy about Metal Gear Solid

02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:53.380
5, holy crap.

02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:54.980
We've already gotten portable ops.

02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:58.980
We've already gotten, what was it, Metal Gear Acid, am I even thinking about the right

02:08:58.980 --> 02:08:59.980
game?

02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:01.680
We've already got portable games, we've already got offshoots.

02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:05.940
Before it just came out and they were really trying to end the series, the eye and the

02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:12.900
logo just prime over-analytical-ness, that's what I mean.

02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:17.060
Well, you know what's interesting is it's not just Metal Gear that Konami is putting

02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:18.060
on the phone.

02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:21.540
If I recall, they also announced DDR and some of their other big franchises on iPhones.

02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:26.760
So to me, this is more of a story about that iPhone is starting to legitimately become

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:30.220
a gaming platform of sorts, as much to Loki's dismay.

02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:33.340
Yeah, Konami Mobile, yeah, that sounds about right.

02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:37.260
Yeah, but they already had cell phone games, so that's a gamey, I'm sorry.

02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:41.740
Well, not Metal Gear, hence my real reliance right on that.

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:45.980
Yeah, but this isn't really a good Metal Gear game anyways.

02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:50.940
Some interesting comments in chat, Bob Coffee says, Metal Gear Touch will fail.

02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:53.860
Pitstun says, Metal Gear Touch is a glorified light gun game.

02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:57.240
Game Guru says, Metal Gear Solid Touch should be on Wii.

02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:58.860
So should the Silent Hill arcade game.

02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:00.340
That should be on Wii.

02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:03.580
All right, well, Jason, thank you so much for contributing to the list.

02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:06.380
And we'll see what happens if the chat room votes it as one of the top three.

02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:07.900
Hell yeah, you guys better.

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:08.900
All right, we'll see.

02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:09.900
Bye.

02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:10.900
Thanks.

02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:15.460
All right, let's go around and get our in-studio, our number one picks for biggest news story

02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:16.460
of 2008.

02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:20.100
Dark Sakura, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?

02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:21.180
The biggest news story?

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:24.460
I'd actually say our pair of anniversaries.

02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:25.460
How so?

02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:27.460
For the station, seriously.

02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:30.140
No, really.

02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:31.220
Any criteria you want.

02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:38.920
It's really big for us because we not only hit 300 episodes, but we hit six years.

02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:46.920
So I'd say that's fairly monumental that, you know, we're that bored.

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:52.300
You know, and I don't know if there is another, and if I am mistaken, please feel free to

02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:57.440
correct me, but I don't think there is another show that runs weekly that has hit 300 episodes

02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:01.020
in the history of the internet, of gaming.

02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:02.460
If there is, please let me know.

02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:03.460
And again, that's weekly.

02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:06.740
I know there's some that ran daily that were able to hit 300 episodes, but I don't know

02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:10.140
if any of them ran weekly because in order to hit 300 episodes, you would have to have

02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:11.460
run for six years.

02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:12.460
Trust us, we know.

02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:13.460
Six and a half years.

02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:17.620
Six and a half years, yeah, at this point because we take a week off once in a while.

02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:21.340
So there you go.

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:25.660
By the way, major props to a Dark Sakura for her delivery of We're That Bored.

02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:27.660
Alright.

02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:28.980
Hey.

02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:29.980
It's so true, though.

02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:34.740
Alright, no, you know, we do it because, you know, what else would we do?

02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:35.740
Crack?

02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:36.740
Uh, Loki!

02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:38.740
Well, since that was going to be my number one.

02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:39.740
Winners don't use drugs.

02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:43.580
But that was going to be my number one because I did dress up like, uh, Sackboy then.

02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:45.820
That was going to be your number one?

02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:46.820
Really?

02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:49.180
My God, you're getting Capcom on me.

02:11:49.180 --> 02:11:50.900
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, listen.

02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:55.140
I have a better number one, though, because this small event happened.

02:11:55.140 --> 02:12:01.960
In May of 2008, Activision announced that Guitar Hero, which became Guitar Hero World

02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:05.820
Tour, would now have drums.

02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:07.300
And would now be copying Rock Band.

02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:15.220
It would be the first music game in the history of music games to have drums and guitars in

02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:16.220
the same game.

02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:18.700
Oh, wait, except that's inaccurate.

02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:22.900
But that's what they said, or something like that.

02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:28.260
Meaning like how, uh, they got up there, I think, and said, like, this is the first time

02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:31.540
you're going to be able to get to play the guitar and play the drums and sing at the

02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:33.620
same time, all in one game.

02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:36.700
And everybody's just thinking, like, uh, lol, Rock Band.

02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:40.700
Well, I think they meant in the Guitar Hero series, but yeah, yeah.

02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:44.060
But you know, you know how them suits are.

02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:47.340
They like to think that we're all ignorant, which is not true.

02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:48.340
So.

02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:54.340
All right, uh, my number one, I mean, I decided to pick something I actually think is the

02:12:54.340 --> 02:13:00.140
number one thing that happened this year in gaming, like huge news, I think, that changes

02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:02.180
gaming in a big, big way.

02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:05.340
And uh, do you guys remember I've been talking about something that I said was going to be

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:06.460
huge for gaming?

02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:09.780
It was announced early in the year and then happened, and I'm saying it's going to be

02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:11.980
like the YouTube of the 360.

02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:12.980
Sing Star Abba?

02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:16.700
No, not Sing Star Abba!

02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:20.620
Community games on the new Xbox experience, the fact that they brought in community games,

02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:23.020
not just that, but Netflix.

02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:26.500
So I'm going to kind of loop it all in and say the new Xbox experience, I think, is the

02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:30.940
biggest new story of 2008 because it brought us not just the community games and the, you

02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:36.860
know, web 2.0 age of my 360, but the fact that I can freaking stream movies to my 360.

02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:39.940
That just bumped up its entertainment capacity by a ton.

02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:40.940
You know what I mean?

02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:47.380
It's not a gaming system, but a movie hub, you know, an entertainment system, really.

02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:53.660
So uh, new, uh, NXC is my number one story of 2008.

02:13:53.660 --> 02:13:58.100
But I want to specifically state it's because of community games and Netflix and not necessarily

02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:01.540
because of stuff that was just to kind of catch up to other companies like the Avatars

02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:05.180
and you know, there are some things about NXC I don't like, but I do think those two

02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:08.620
particular aspects make it very, very relevant.

02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:12.260
Sorry, I know, you would think Sing Star Abba would be there.

02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:15.340
Maybe if I got to do a top five, I don't know.

02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:17.420
All right.

02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:20.700
So since we're skipping an elimination round this time, you guys get to vote on this as

02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:21.700
it is right here.

02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:25.260
I'm going to post this in the chat room there and you can send in your votes.

02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:27.300
Prepare for floodage in chat.

02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:32.460
All right, so you can place a vote for your number one and your number two picks in the

02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:34.460
chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:36.340
These were the top ones.

02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:38.740
Jack Thompson getting the beat down.

02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:42.380
Nintendo fucks up the E3 press conference, as Loki said, fucked up.

02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:44.940
WhatTheyPlay.com ass hattery.

02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:47.100
Stephen Colbert is in rock band.

02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:50.020
Little Big Planet Karan lyrics and the controversy.

02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:51.900
Notice that's Karan, not Korean.

02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:55.580
Old E3 is coming back, buy E for All.

02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:57.340
Metal Gear goes to iPhone.

02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:00.200
OLR hits 300 episodes in six years.

02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:03.460
I love how that's mixed in with all these other stories.

02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:05.640
Guitar Hero announces drums.

02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:08.700
And edXE community game and Netflix.

02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:09.780
So there you have it.

02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:15.500
Send your number one and number two picks via private message to Sky in the chat room.

02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:18.780
While you do that, we have some more news for you guys and we'll get to the results

02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:19.780
shortly.

02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:20.780
Please hurry and get those in.

02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:22.900
Loki, we'll start off with you.

02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:23.900
Yes.

02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:30.740
Speaking of games with guitars and drums, Rock Band 2 for the Wii is finally going to

02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:34.620
get some download content starting in early 2009.

02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:39.420
They're going to be, I guess, adding that feature to it as well.

02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:45.140
And they're going to start with the content that was originally available.

02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:50.140
I think the free 20 song pack or whatever.

02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:52.860
So that'll be interesting.

02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:55.060
Oh, that's cool.

02:15:55.060 --> 02:16:02.680
Yeah, free 20 song pack, I guess, that was available already and then the free 30 download

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:07.380
tracks from the original Rock Band download content library.

02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:08.380
Huh.

02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:09.780
Very cool.

02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:12.860
So free songs for the people that bought Rock Band.

02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:14.660
That's right, because the Wii people have to wait for a while.

02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:18.340
Well, actually, no, I guess not because it just came out like last week or so.

02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:21.740
So that wouldn't be too bad.

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:24.780
It's nice to see, though, that there's actual download content for some of these games.

02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:27.860
I mean, because if you think about it, they haven't really done it.

02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:31.380
I'm surprised, like even Animal Crossing or something, they haven't seen any really download

02:16:31.380 --> 02:16:32.380
content.

02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:36.260
I'm very surprised about that as well, considering, you know, how Nintendo is.

02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:37.300
You know what I mean?

02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:41.720
There's like no download content for any Nintendo stuff.

02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:48.100
No new tracks in Mario Kart, no new characters in Smash Brothers, no new music in Wii Music.

02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:50.180
Nothing.

02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:51.180
Very surprised.

02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:52.180
Me, too.

02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:53.180
I am very surprised.

02:16:53.180 --> 02:16:55.780
I'm very curious to see how the download content's going to work.

02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:57.140
That is going to be very interesting.

02:16:57.140 --> 02:16:59.100
Very, very interesting.

02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:00.820
All right.

02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:02.620
More stories, yes?

02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:04.220
There is.

02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:11.940
Actually, this is pretty cool that for Rock Band, they're actually getting some new content.

02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:17.940
They're actually getting Roy Orbison.

02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:21.180
How's that for cool?

02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:22.180
Who's Roy Orbison?

02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:24.220
It seems kind of random to me.

02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:31.340
Well, this is actually reported by CMT, but they're actually putting in a pack of Roy

02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:37.980
Orbison songs that are going to be on Rock Band 2.

02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:38.980
They would know.

02:17:38.980 --> 02:17:41.660
Didn't he do You Got It?

02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:42.960
Yeah.

02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:45.180
They would know because CMT is owned by MTV.

02:17:45.180 --> 02:17:46.180
He sang Pretty Woman.

02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:47.180
Yeah, he did.

02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:48.180
Yeah.

02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:49.180
Pretty Woman.

02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:50.180
That's probably the song that's going to be there.

02:17:50.180 --> 02:17:51.180
Just you wait.

02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:52.620
Roy Orbison's cool.

02:17:52.620 --> 02:17:56.260
Plus he was with the Traveling Wilburys, and that was pretty cool.

02:17:56.260 --> 02:18:04.860
Well, Guitar Hero's going to be getting some more free download tracks in the form of two

02:18:04.860 --> 02:18:06.940
Bruce Springsteen tracks.

02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:15.260
Apparently, let's see, I guess, Born to Run and My Lucky Day.

02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:21.940
I guess My Lucky Day's office new single, and Born to Run, of course, is a classic track.

02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:28.140
Those will be available on both the PSN and Xbox Live Marketplace January 27th through

02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:29.140
February 4th.

02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:30.140
All right.

02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:37.900
We're going to be opening up the Skype line and taking your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:18:37.900 --> 02:18:40.940
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:18:40.940 --> 02:18:43.660
You can go ahead and give us a call, and we'll take a couple of your calls.

02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:47.980
Meanwhile, do we have any last minute stories here while I try to tally up the last of the

02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:52.220
Cage Match votes, too?

02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:53.220
No.

02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:55.220
Yeah, it really wasn't a very busy week, was it?

02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:58.260
In other news, Jamie wants a cookie.

02:18:58.260 --> 02:18:59.940
There are cookies, actually, here in studio.

02:18:59.940 --> 02:19:00.940
I know.

02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:04.280
See, you left them here, and I was going to eat them all, but then I thought, what a good

02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:11.980
idea to keep cookies in studio on hand for those moments when Jamie says, I need a cookie.

02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:16.220
That's not going to actually happen after the beginning of the year, Rob.

02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:17.980
Why are you going on a diet?

02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:19.140
I don't go on diets.

02:19:19.140 --> 02:19:20.140
Are you going on a lifestyle adjustment?

02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:23.460
I adjust my lifestyle, and that's not exactly what I'm doing.

02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:24.460
I'm readjusting.

02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:26.980
Won't there be a type of cookie you can still eat?

02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:27.980
Fiber.

02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.980
All right.

02:19:28.980 --> 02:19:29.980
Fiber cookies.

02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:30.980
All right.

02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:31.980
Fiberglass cookies.

02:19:31.980 --> 02:19:32.980
Holy cookies.

02:19:32.980 --> 02:19:33.980
All right.

02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:35.100
If you hear a crackling noise, it's because I picked up a call like a minute ago, and

02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:36.100
the poor guy's having to wait.

02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:37.100
Hi.

02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:38.100
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:39.100
Who's this?

02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:40.100
It's GSXPA, and no aesthetic.

02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:41.580
I am not ordering a pizza for OLR.

02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:42.580
Yeah.

02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:44.940
Please don't order pizzas to the studio if you know where we live.

02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:46.420
That's not nice.

02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:47.980
GSXPA, what's on your mind?

02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:52.340
Now, I think I know what's on your mind, because you live in a certain part of the Bay Area

02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:55.620
where you got something special this week, right?

02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:56.620
Yeah.

02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:58.580
DJ Max Technica at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

02:19:58.580 --> 02:20:02.500
Tell us about DJ Max Technica at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:03.500
What's it like?

02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:04.500
Yeah.

02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:09.340
Basically, it's kind of like Elite Beat Agents meets Luminous.

02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:10.660
You have two halves of the screen.

02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:15.020
You have this line going from one side of the screen to the other, and then there's

02:20:15.020 --> 02:20:16.020
these markers.

02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:20.380
You have to press it as the line goes over them.

02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:24.900
And it's kind of like big meaning that as you press the markers, you recreate parts

02:20:24.900 --> 02:20:27.900
of the music.

02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:29.900
Yeah.

02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:30.900
But will it blend?

02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:31.900
No.

02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:32.900
Is it fun?

02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:33.900
That's what I want to know.

02:20:33.900 --> 02:20:34.900
Is it fun?

02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:35.900
Yeah.

02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:36.900
Did you have fun with it?

02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:37.900
It's pretty fun.

02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:45.780
On the first day, we had 20 people in line, so between journeys, I had to wait 20 games,

02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:47.220
which wasn't really a problem for me.

02:20:47.220 --> 02:20:49.020
I just played other games between rounds.

02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:50.020
My God.

02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:53.500
Isn't that like a three-hour wait, 20 games, or at least an hour?

02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:58.740
Well, the problem is the life meter on the game is very harsh.

02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:05.140
If you miss seven to 10 notes in a row, you automatically fail, and it's not like say

02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:10.220
popping music, where if you fail the first stage, you get to go to the next.

02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:15.740
Plus, on the final stage, the difficulty for the progression from one stage to the next

02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:16.740
is really harsh.

02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:21.020
On the first stage, you can pick a level one song, but on the second, the lowest you can

02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:24.740
pick is level three, I think, and for the final stage, the lowest you can pick is a

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:25.740
level five.

02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:31.380
So by Thursday, you have songs that initially you have a lot of trouble with, and you end

02:21:31.380 --> 02:21:35.220
up failing within the first 30 seconds.

02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:38.900
All right, so I got to turn this call around real quick, though, and address another topic

02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:42.300
that we brought up earlier in the show, because as neat as this game sounds and all, I've

02:21:42.300 --> 02:21:48.140
got to know your thoughts on, because I know you're a DJ Maxx fan, the whole Konami lawsuit,

02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:49.340
and don't just say it's bullshit.

02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:52.300
I'm just curious, like, what are your thoughts?

02:21:52.300 --> 02:21:58.580
Well, and you know that Konami sued Rockstar for In the Groove and won, right?

02:21:58.580 --> 02:21:59.580
Sure, yeah.

02:21:59.580 --> 02:22:03.660
Well, I mean, personally, I think the whole In the Groove thing had it coming, because

02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:07.980
it was basically DDR, just with different music and charts, like, some modifiers.

02:22:07.980 --> 02:22:14.460
DJ Maxx, I have different opinions for, because at least it seems to be different from Beat

02:22:14.460 --> 02:22:15.460
Mania.

02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:21.620
Like, for example, DJ Maxx's portable that, I mean, Konami hasn't really done a portable

02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:22.620
2DX.

02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:27.260
I mean, yeah, there's the Game Boy Beat Minis, but for money here, those aren't really good,

02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:28.740
and they weren't very popular.

02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:38.660
Whereas with DJ Maxx's portable here, it was so successful that it actually became its

02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:45.660
own series, and so we just want to have mixed feelings about this lawsuit.

02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:55.300
I mean, yeah, DJ Maxx is a lot like Beat Mania, but at the same time, I don't know if Panda

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:59.380
Vision really deserved this, I mean...

02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:03.380
You know, I gotta say, though, you get us thinking about something, I gotta say, you

02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:06.420
have a well-thought-out point, because you got me thinking about something I didn't think

02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:14.100
about before, because, like, I kind of agree with you that the reason why In the Groove

02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:17.500
got the beat down, I know a lot of people are pissed off about the whole In the Groove

02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:21.100
lawsuit and everything, but let's face it, In the Groove was DDR, okay?

02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:26.260
Like it was, like, really, really, really the same thing, okay?

02:23:26.260 --> 02:23:30.220
But you're right, they haven't really put out, Konami has not really put out a portable

02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:34.300
version of their game, and I don't even know if you can really count those Game Boy Beat

02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:37.860
Mania games, because they were so long ago, they were on a completely different system,

02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:40.340
they just weren't even the same as the PSP.

02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:42.380
That is kind of an interesting point.

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:44.620
Anyone in the studio think that changes things at all?

02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:45.620
No.

02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:46.620
No?

02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:47.620
Why not?

02:23:47.620 --> 02:23:52.180
I mean, just because they, I don't think they're gonna put out a portable DDR, it just

02:23:52.180 --> 02:24:01.420
doesn't make any sense, because the PSP right now, I guess it could be used as, you know,

02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:02.900
you could play DDR on it.

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:07.140
Well, kind of like that StepMania thing for PSP, right?

02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:08.140
That's what I was saying.

02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:12.060
Yeah, you can't play DDR on it, but a lot of people would be like, what's the point?

02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:15.780
I mean, thank you, what is the point, I never understood the point of DDR on a portable

02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:16.780
platform.

02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:22.540
Well, on the go, I mean, sometimes you can't, sometimes you don't have gaming on the go,

02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:26.220
or you can't take your pad and such with you.

02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:30.940
But here's the thing, though, is, before I remember talking to a Konami rep one time

02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:35.180
about if, when they were planning on bringing over Guitar Freaks, and this was like a long

02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:41.460
time ago, and they're like, well, unfortunately they don't know how to, you know, they don't

02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:47.940
know how to market a guitar game for the US, you know, whereas like a DJing game, oh, people

02:24:47.940 --> 02:24:51.460
want to play, you know, DJing games, which I think would be totally opposite, you know,

02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:54.060
who wouldn't want to be in like a rock band or something like that.

02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:59.900
But that's the thing, is, if they have trouble figuring out how to market a guitar game,

02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:05.100
you know, which is kind of a no-brainer nowadays, what makes people think, you know, what, I

02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:10.300
don't think that they would think that a DDR game on a PSP would be a good idea, because

02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:14.420
they can't go, oh, you can get exorcised, no you can't, because you're just playing

02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:19.980
a little PSP game, but, I don't know, it would be kind of cool maybe like a BeatMania game

02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:20.980
or something like that.

02:25:20.980 --> 02:25:21.980
Yeah, right.

02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:27.340
Yeah, there was a pump and a DMR on the PSP, but that also, but that tanked, as far as

02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:29.380
I'm concerned.

02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:31.060
Because what is the fucking point?

02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:36.300
I mean, really, beating Groovy on the PSP, I don't know, maybe.

02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:39.500
Oh, yes, beating Groovy, oh gosh.

02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:44.540
I mean, beating Groovy had a lot of potential, I mean, I can understand why it's only five

02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:51.060
buttons, but, I mean, whoever was behind beating Groovy just handled it really poorly, I mean,

02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:56.300
the songs are too easy, they went out of their way to replace all the awesome pop and music

02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:58.300
characters, and...

02:25:58.300 --> 02:26:04.200
God, you are so right, that's what's so frustrating about beating Groovy, is that beating Groovy

02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:08.020
did have a lot of potential to be a really awesome game, and, oh wait, they already have

02:26:08.020 --> 02:26:12.420
that game, it's called pop and music, and it's, like, superior in every way, and it's

02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:13.420
just insulting.

02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:18.620
Like, what Konami did with beating Groovy is insulting to us people that have been supporting

02:26:18.620 --> 02:26:19.620
them for so many years.

02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:21.740
I'm sorry, there's really no other way to describe it.

02:26:21.740 --> 02:26:25.820
Well, I mean, I can understand the rationale behind the five button mode, but, like, the

02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:30.580
lack of song listening and such, I mean, hell, look at the US version of BeatMania, that

02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:37.860
had, like, at least 30 songs ranging from really easy to really hard, and, aside from

02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:43.620
that five key beat medium mode, I mean, did it, and the new difficulty system, and the

02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:49.300
gray system, which, isn't that really big of a deal, I mean, at least it's pretty faithful,

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:54.940
like, as far as the basics go, whereas beating Groovy, like, what the fuck is this?

02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:58.340
Alright, uh, GSCCA, we're gonna let you go, so we can get some more calls, but thank you

02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:02.900
for the review of, uh, DJMaxx, uh, Technica, and, uh, I definitely will be going to the

02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:05.060
Bay Area at some point to check it out, I promise.

02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:06.060
Let me know.

02:27:06.060 --> 02:27:09.820
As soon as next weekend, I, I have, uh, stuff going on in South Bay next weekend anyway,

02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:10.820
I might swing by.

02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:11.820
Alright.

02:27:11.820 --> 02:27:12.820
I don't know, though.

02:27:12.820 --> 02:27:16.540
I'm living on Twitter, I have, I have free time all next week anyways.

02:27:16.540 --> 02:27:19.760
The problem is, I have to take my female friend with me who thinks video games are stupid,

02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:22.260
so I don't know how I'm gonna entertain her, but we'll think of something.

02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:23.260
Oh, alright then.

02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:24.260
Alright.

02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:25.260
Alright, see ya.

02:27:25.260 --> 02:27:26.260
Bye.

02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:29.420
Alright, yeah, you know, I think I've made it no secret on the show, I do Rocky Horror

02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:33.820
Picture Show still in the Bay, and I do stuff on stage and stuff, um, and I'm, I'm signed

02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:38.940
up to this show in the South Bay next week, so I'll probably go, but, um, yeah, my friend

02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:41.180
that goes with me doesn't, doesn't get the video game thing.

02:27:41.180 --> 02:27:43.380
Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:27:43.380 --> 02:27:47.020
I have returned to spam up the airwaves even more.

02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:49.260
Please do, Jason, what's on your mind?

02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:51.460
Yes, I, I wanted to talk about something earlier.

02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:55.580
I don't even remember what it was, but something else just hit me, so I'll kill time with that.

02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:56.580
Sure.

02:27:56.580 --> 02:28:01.060
Is it just me, or was this a year of classical throwbacks?

02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:05.260
Well, yeah, look at, look at what game topped our list.

02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:09.620
I mean, if we didn't put anything on the list, Mega Man 9 would have won amongst the listeners,

02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:10.620
hands down.

02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:11.620
Hands down.

02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:16.540
That's a pretty good definitive pick, and that is what I mean, it's, uh, I was basically

02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:21.120
just going to elaborate and say, sure, years back, Nintendo has resold their whole catalog,

02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:22.120
but that doesn't mean anything.

02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:26.300
This is the year of Mega Man 9, Braid, and I had another example.

02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:32.060
Is it gaming, or is it Capcom, because, you know, the biggest ones I think of, Mega Man

02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:38.700
9, Bionic Commando Rearmed, which was pretty damn impressive, and, uh, Super Street Fighter,

02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:43.620
Turbo HD, Remix, Super, Uber, I can't believe I paid $10 for this version.

02:28:43.620 --> 02:28:47.420
The movie, the game, anniversary, third style?

02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:49.420
Yes.

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:54.260
I mean, Capcom was one of the biggest offenders, quote unquote, in this category, but at the

02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:58.220
same time, I think Capcom finally started doing the games this year, but we wanted them

02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:04.220
to do these downloadable games when they first came out, in a way.

02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:09.420
But also, you know, a game like LittleBigPlanet, what's the first thing people do in LittleBigPlanet's

02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:10.420
level creator?

02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:13.980
Remake World 1-1 for Mario Brothers, yes, make Mario a LittleBigPlanet.

02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:15.900
I was going to say porn.

02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:17.500
Or porn, but you know what I mean?

02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:18.620
They'll make the cock level.

02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:24.300
A large majority of those levels are, you know, remakes of other games from another

02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:26.400
day, in this newer engine.

02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:30.180
So there definitely is a big retro vibe going on in 08.

02:29:30.180 --> 02:29:34.060
I don't know if you guys have gone back and actually watched it, or actually looked for

02:29:34.060 --> 02:29:38.220
it, but you remember the Gradius level that the Japanese guy made?

02:29:38.220 --> 02:29:39.220
Yes.

02:29:39.220 --> 02:29:41.260
Everybody was talking about.

02:29:41.260 --> 02:29:46.120
Just in case I just referred to it by name, the level name was Libidus.jp.

02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:49.700
He has made SuperLibidus.jp.

02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:52.140
It is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up.

02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:54.540
Oh, I'm going to have to check his levels.

02:29:54.540 --> 02:29:58.620
I haven't looked at a while, but that guy did some amazing shit in LittleBigPlanet.

02:29:58.620 --> 02:30:04.380
It's interesting because he has, yeah he did, all of the beatmania type level, and no, not

02:30:04.380 --> 02:30:05.380
a math level.

02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:06.380
Anyways.

02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:11.460
There was another new one, I think it was supposed to be based off some Japanese shooter,

02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:12.740
but I didn't understand it.

02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:18.300
But now that they've given an actual paint gun, I'm curious to see what he does next.

02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:19.300
You know what I mean?

02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:21.680
All the shots are just hard anymore now that you have the paint gun.

02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:25.560
That's a huge extra mechanic they've put in the game.

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:30.300
The only thing that I don't like about this SuperLibidus is that at the same time it adds

02:30:30.300 --> 02:30:37.700
a very interesting twist, but if you're getting shot at, and you shoot that bullet, the two

02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:42.560
bullets bounce off and fly in the other direction, and fly in opposite directions.

02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:44.380
And like I said, it's a vertical scroller.

02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:49.380
He has this, if you think of really, really old vertical shoot-em-ups, he has a crosshair

02:30:49.380 --> 02:30:53.460
that's not even a quarter of the way up the screen permanently fixed right in front of

02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:55.060
your ship.

02:30:55.060 --> 02:31:00.100
There are ground quote-unquote enemies shooting at you that you can't destroy.

02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:01.100
What was that game?

02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:04.900
There was a game on the NES that had that, was it Xanax, Xevious?

02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:07.060
You had that crosshair permanently fixed.

02:31:07.060 --> 02:31:09.060
You might be thinking Zaxxon.

02:31:09.060 --> 02:31:10.060
No not Zaxxon.

02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:11.060
It was Xevious.

02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:12.860
It was Xevious with the little blue landers.

02:31:12.860 --> 02:31:13.860
Was it Xevious?

02:31:13.860 --> 02:31:14.860
I think so.

02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:16.260
Because that target showed you where the bombs would drop.

02:31:16.260 --> 02:31:17.260
Yeah.

02:31:17.260 --> 02:31:18.260
Yeah, that's what it was.

02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:19.260
That's pretty sure.

02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:23.260
If you were describing it, I thought it was Xevious.

02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:26.500
There might be a bomb button that I just haven't found yet.

02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:31.220
Just like Libidus, I died very quickly and sucked really hard.

02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:33.220
Nice.

02:31:33.220 --> 02:31:37.680
And it made me laugh a lot, because when you lose the level, just like in Libidus, you have

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:43.140
a little halfpipe with all of your orbs, depending on how far you got, but there's a key in there.

02:31:43.140 --> 02:31:46.100
And when you do it and leave the level, guess what you get?

02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:47.500
A new level with a key?

02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:49.360
Super Libidus easy mode!

02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:52.540
You fail so hard, you get a key just like in Devil May Cry.

02:31:52.540 --> 02:31:53.540
Nice.

02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:57.340
I got to cry all over again at the worst insult a game could ever hand me.

02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:59.140
I really need to get in there and make a level.

02:31:59.140 --> 02:32:01.480
I need to tear myself away from WoW long enough, Jason.

02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:04.680
How do I do it?

02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:05.680
Close your laptop.

02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:10.000
No, you play on desktops, what am I thinking?

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.140
Kick the monitor.

02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:13.140
Break it.

02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:14.140
I don't know.

02:32:14.140 --> 02:32:16.140
If I break the monitor, then I don't have one for the show.

02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:20.420
Being the fact that I've never been much of a WoW person, I can't offer, an MMO person

02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:21.980
rather, I can't really offer much advice.

02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:22.980
That's all right.

02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:23.980
I'll get to it someday.

02:32:23.980 --> 02:32:26.580
I do have a lot of fun when I play a little bit of Planet, I'll get to a level at some

02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:27.580
point.

02:32:27.580 --> 02:32:29.740
All right, well, Jason, we're going to let you go to try and get a couple more calls,

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:33.420
and we have to read the list list results and see if you're suggesting me the top three.

02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:38.380
You guys have better voted me in, at least number two, I can respect a certain one for

02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:39.380
number one.

02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:40.380
We're about to find out in two seconds.

02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:41.380
All right, see you, Jason.

02:32:41.380 --> 02:32:42.380
All right, folks.

02:32:42.380 --> 02:32:52.620
Our fearless webmaster, Jason, VXJsonXV, Jason for short.

02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:55.060
Let's talk about the winners, shall we, of list list.

02:32:55.060 --> 02:32:57.220
Don't worry, we'll get back to the phone and do a couple more calls.

02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:01.260
Let's get to the top three based on your votes.

02:33:01.260 --> 02:33:06.380
Hold on, I have to add it up here so I don't read it wrong.

02:33:06.380 --> 02:33:09.700
Okay, there is definitely a very definitive top three tonight.

02:33:09.700 --> 02:33:11.380
No ties, no nothing.

02:33:11.380 --> 02:33:13.540
Very easy top three spelled out here tonight.

02:33:13.540 --> 02:33:16.780
The number three top news story of 2008.

02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:20.300
Actually, I'm curious.

02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:24.420
Folks here in studio, provided you didn't look over my shoulder, any predictions on

02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:26.860
what they thought was the number one story of 2008?

02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:27.860
Cookie.

02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:28.860
Cookie.

02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:30.860
I don't think that was on the list, DarkSucker.

02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:37.860
I'd say either our 300th episode just because they're kissing ass, or guitar hero.

02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:38.860
All right.

02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:39.860
Bradley?

02:33:39.860 --> 02:33:40.860
Any thoughts?

02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:41.860
No?

02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:42.860
Or.

02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:43.860
Or.

02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:44.860
All right, let's see.

02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:45.860
Let's see.

02:33:45.860 --> 02:33:50.260
All right, the number three biggest story of 2008.

02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:51.260
This is definitive.

02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:52.260
This is absolute.

02:33:52.260 --> 02:33:53.260
There is no arguing.

02:33:53.260 --> 02:33:55.540
This is a flawless process.

02:33:55.540 --> 02:34:00.380
Jack Thompson getting the beat down was the number three pick for the biggest story of

02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:01.380
2008.

02:34:01.380 --> 02:34:02.380
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:03.380
I said his name out loud.

02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:04.380
That just gives him power.

02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:05.380
Sorry.

02:34:05.380 --> 02:34:07.500
Oh, but not in the state of Florida.

02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:12.340
The number two biggest story of 2008 in gaming.

02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:16.340
The new Xbox experience brings us community games and Netflix.

02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:18.540
There you go.

02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:25.300
And lastly, the top story of 2008, the biggest story in gaming.

02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:32.260
Orange Lounge Radio hits 300 episodes in six years, you narcissistic bastards.

02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:35.900
Hey, it is monumental.

02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:43.220
Like I said, we are that full of ourselves.

02:34:43.220 --> 02:34:47.900
I just love that the chat, you know, it just goes to show our live listeners and the podcast

02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:53.020
listeners too, the whole family here at OLR, everybody that helps make this show a success.

02:34:53.020 --> 02:35:00.580
Everybody has to spank their monkey that sometimes everybody contributes to that in one way or

02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:01.580
another.

02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:02.580
All right.

02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:05.820
Oh, Jason's going apeshit in the chat room and not letting people talk because they didn't

02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:09.260
vote his as a top three.

02:35:09.260 --> 02:35:12.620
I will say though, Jason, yours to get some votes.

02:35:12.620 --> 02:35:17.580
It would have come in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:18.580
No sixth.

02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:25.860
It would have come in sixth out of the list, so there you go, Jason.

02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:26.860
Very rude.

02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:27.940
All right.

02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:30.700
It's rude to silence those who disagree with you.

02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:32.700
All right.

02:35:32.700 --> 02:35:36.500
Let's do another call.

02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:41.480
Orange Lounge Radio's username on Skype, 1877 game OLR is the number to call.

02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:44.120
We'll do like one more call then we will wrap up.

02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:46.340
For live listeners, no afterbirth tonight.

02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:47.340
Sorry, guys.

02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:50.500
We have a late start, so we have jobs to get to tomorrow.

02:35:50.500 --> 02:35:57.140
We're already well after midnight on the East Coast, so we're not going to do an afterbirth

02:35:57.140 --> 02:36:00.540
tonight, but do stay tuned because I do have a special message for you after the show just

02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:01.540
for the live folks.

02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:03.020
Let's get to one more call.

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:04.020
Hi.

02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:05.020
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:06.020
Who's this?

02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:07.020
You know, Legend of Zaku.

02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:08.020
Legend of Zaku.

02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:10.820
What's on your mind?

02:36:10.820 --> 02:36:11.820
Nothing much.

02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:17.220
Just gloating, just looking back at what was once this year and in the next few days we'll

02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:18.620
be the next year.

02:36:18.620 --> 02:36:19.620
Yeah.

02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:23.180
This year has gone by really fast.

02:36:23.180 --> 02:36:24.740
Shit happened really quickly.

02:36:24.740 --> 02:36:27.640
What do you think of the list of the biggest stories of 2008?

02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:30.620
Was there something else you would have put on that?

02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:34.020
I guess it was pretty much concise of what happened.

02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:38.540
Guess Jack Thompson's disbarring should have been up there pretty high.

02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:43.740
I wouldn't say number one, but it should have been an honorable mention at least.

02:36:43.740 --> 02:36:49.180
With all respect to Dark Sakura and for putting that on the list originally, in my world,

02:36:49.180 --> 02:36:50.900
I hate talking about him.

02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:51.900
Totally.

02:36:51.900 --> 02:36:52.900
I don't want that anymore.

02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:56.580
I don't like that being anywhere near the top stories just because I feel like the more

02:36:56.580 --> 02:36:58.780
we talk about him, the more strength he gains.

02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:01.100
But he has no strength to begin with.

02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:03.460
He has no legal power anymore.

02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:05.900
True, true, but he just sucks.

02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:09.140
There's still a story about him this week and I didn't even know he would have been

02:37:09.140 --> 02:37:10.140
there.

02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:11.140
Don't go away.

02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:12.140
Yeah, he won't.

02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:13.140
Make it stop.

02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:14.740
People will keep talking about him.

02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:17.780
Game politics, I'm looking at you, yeah?

02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:19.540
Keep talking about him.

02:37:19.540 --> 02:37:27.700
Besides that, obviously Final Fantasy 13 on the 360, that was the biggest.

02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:32.380
That right there would have been the big summer surprise right there.

02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:35.320
Funny how quickly we all forgot about that one, huh?

02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:38.740
I think for me though, the reason why that missed my list is that's something I've kind

02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:43.620
of come to expect at this point in the year, is that most things are on all the platforms

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:44.620
now.

02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:47.100
I mean, you've kind of heard, I think Capcom.

02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:49.260
It was unprecedented when it was announced.

02:37:49.260 --> 02:37:54.900
It was almost like jaw-dropping that it came out of nowhere.

02:37:54.900 --> 02:37:58.340
I think at some point during this year, Capcom came out and said, look, the only way we're

02:37:58.340 --> 02:38:02.220
going to make our money back is to put our games out on all the platforms.

02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:07.660
And ever since then, in my opinion, this news has not been as shocking.

02:38:07.660 --> 02:38:08.660
But that's just me.

02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:17.540
When Square dropped that bombshell over E3, that was a critical blow to the PS3's exclusivity.

02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:23.100
The only thing they have now is Metal Gear Solid 4 and first-party exclusives.

02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:28.840
So it pretty much gives people less of a reason to get a PS3 in the first place, since there's

02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:36.700
no big-ticket games exclusive for their system, aside from the ones made by Sony themselves.

02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:43.260
So it's like, why should I get Final Fantasy 13 when I could get it for my 360 easily and

02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:47.300
rack up on the achievements and whatever other features they may have?

02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:48.580
Because the controller sucks?

02:38:48.580 --> 02:38:49.580
I don't know.

02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:53.140
But yeah, you see the argument I'm trying to make, right?

02:38:53.140 --> 02:38:54.140
No, I do.

02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:55.140
I do.

02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:56.140
It was huge.

02:38:56.140 --> 02:38:57.140
It was huge.

02:38:57.140 --> 02:38:58.140
And Hitstun agrees with you in chat.

02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:02.060
The FF13 announcement was the top story of the year, no doubt.

02:39:02.060 --> 02:39:10.900
Where I could pull it off in terms of making that 360 version on the same level as the

02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:20.220
PS3, then they'll be raking in shitloads of money because of the tens of millions of users

02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:23.520
that make up the 360's install base.

02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:31.100
So it's like, in that way, they see a bigger picture in terms of how much money they're

02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:32.820
willing to make.

02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:36.180
Everything else, every loyalty be damned.

02:39:36.180 --> 02:39:37.180
Yeah.

02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:41.980
All right, well, Zaku, any other quick thoughts before I let you go and try to wrap up the

02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:42.980
show?

02:39:42.980 --> 02:39:49.420
Steam and their sale this week, please, please get Bioshock for five bucks.

02:39:49.420 --> 02:39:50.860
You won't be disappointed.

02:39:50.860 --> 02:39:56.140
Might as well go to Steam right now and just get your cheap-ass games.

02:39:56.140 --> 02:39:57.140
All right.

02:39:57.140 --> 02:39:58.460
I know all of us have the ability.

02:39:58.460 --> 02:39:59.460
Let's go.

02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:00.460
All right.

02:40:00.460 --> 02:40:02.900
Let's go for Bioshock here before we close out the Skypline.

02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:04.700
Zaku, have a good one.

02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:05.700
Have a good one.

02:40:05.700 --> 02:40:07.860
Have a good, you know, new year.

02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:08.860
Happy new year.

02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:09.860
Mm-hmm.

02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:10.860
All right.

02:40:10.860 --> 02:40:18.460
All right, we are going to try to wrap it up here and close up shop for the night.

02:40:18.460 --> 02:40:21.980
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:26.140
Remember, hey, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about Orange Lounge

02:40:26.140 --> 02:40:31.420
Radio because word of mouth is really the biggest way for us to spread word about the

02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:32.420
show.

02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:35.180
So we would really, really appreciate that.

02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:37.420
All right.

02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:39.860
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:44.060
DarkSakura, your final thought for this last OLR of 2008.

02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:45.060
Reject false icons.

02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:46.060
Mm, well said.

02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:50.900
Loki, PayPal is awesome to dump these stupid little gift cards that I have left with like

02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:54.940
five dollars on each one of them and I can't really spend them in one place.

02:40:54.940 --> 02:40:56.900
It says donate the money to myself.

02:40:56.900 --> 02:40:57.900
Nice.

02:40:57.900 --> 02:40:59.900
How did you donate money to yourself?

02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:05.660
I created a donate link for myself and paid a credit card.

02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:06.660
Nice.

02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:13.300
Arkadian42, Bradley, whatever your name is, what, no, thank you for being here.

02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:16.540
And what is your final thought?

02:41:16.540 --> 02:41:19.780
My new year's resolution to play the games I bought this year.

02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:20.780
All right.

02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:24.140
Me too.

02:41:24.140 --> 02:41:27.460
My final thought for this, the last show of 2008.

02:41:27.460 --> 02:41:33.620
Kids, your pancreas is a much more important organ than you might have thought before.

02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:34.620
Just so you know.

02:41:34.620 --> 02:41:35.620
All right.

02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:37.900
That's going to do it.

02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:41.140
Thank you guys once again for supporting us throughout 2008.

02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:43.340
Will you come back and do it again in 2009?

02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:44.340
Maybe.

02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:45.340
Sure.

02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:46.340
What the hell.

02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:47.340
All right.

02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:48.340
See you next year.

02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:49.340
