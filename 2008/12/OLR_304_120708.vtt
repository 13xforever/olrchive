Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that video game show dedicated to all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Ah! Ah! Ah! You're back, welcome back!

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
I am! Alright! And what an amazing two weeks off it's been! I know, don't rub it in! Not really!

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
You've had all this time off, no I'm just kidding. We are a little late tonight in starting the show, this won't affect anybody listening to this on the podcast

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Except for the fact that the podcast has been going up extremely late lately. That's because we're all pregnant.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
But no, we're not all pregnant!

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Let me introduce Tech Master Loki, who I hope is not pregnant, Jesus. Are you pregnant, Loki?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
No, I am not.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
Welcome Tech Master Loki. We're starting a little late tonight, 7 o'clock Pacific, just because there's personal life things going on that have to, real life, greater than gaming

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Rob has PMS

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yes, I have PMS, and I'm having a baby.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Alright, also say hello to a special guest we have here tonight, Jamie has brought one of her friends here to giggle with us tonight on the show

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Say hello to Becky!

01:44.000 --> 01:44.000
Greetings.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Hello, do you have an online name you use, Becky, that you want people to call you?

01:48.000 --> 01:48.000
Uh, Beckers.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Beckers! I like that. Beckers! It makes me think of Beckum.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Alright, Beckers. Anyhow...

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah, but he married a hoochie.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Posh Spice is pretty hot.

02:02.000 --> 02:02.000
It's a hoochie!

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Anyway, Beckers!

02:05.000 --> 02:05.000
Her boobs don't move!

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Beckers, what type of video games do you enjoy? Do you play a lot of video games? What do you like?

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Really only Rock Band and Karaoke Revolution.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
The hell else do you need right about now?

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
I have really bad tinnitus, so if I try to hold controllers, badness ensues, and then I cry.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
You know what though? Nothing wrong with the music game love. We love music games here at Orange Mountains Radio. It's our roots.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
So we'll definitely be talking more about Rock Band later on. We've got some stories tonight about Rock Band.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Before we get there, we've got to talk about our gaming week. So let's talk about a dark soccer. How was your gaming week?

02:38.000 --> 02:38.000
I refuse.

02:39.000 --> 02:39.000
Refuse?

02:40.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm kidding.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
How dare you refuse?

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
I played some Rock Band. I've been playing Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, and I'm very pissed off at it right now, so I took a break.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Because it's fucking hard!

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, it is. I had the same problem.

02:55.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm going to actually go back and re-level just on that first thing, just because. It's such a pain in the butt. And I got Animal Crossing, and I have been beating my animals with a bug net.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Awesome.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
But I accidentally stole my shovel, and stupid Nook, that butthead, won't get anyone in.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
You know, I was telling Nelly because there's this one stupid rabbit in her town named Francine.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I know which one that is!

03:21.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes, that she absolutely hates. I said that we have to form a hit squad, and just have everybody with bug nets all of a sudden chase her down, like get her trapped in one of those pitfalls, and just all four people hitting her at the same time.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
That would be hilarious.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Do you know who fucking showed up in my village?

03:37.000 --> 03:37.000
Who?

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
Pearl. I hate her. She's a little cat that looks like, oh god, she looks like she has like burn scars all over her face.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Guess who's in my village?

03:47.000 --> 03:47.000
Wolfgang.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
He's fucking awesome.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I can't believe we're having this discussion about a game made for 12 year olds.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Guess what? I got a buddy in my town.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I want the lesbian to move back into my town.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
What was her name? Was that Barbara? No, Barbara was a sheep.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
She was a duck, I think, and had gym equipment in her house, so we put rainbow signs outside of her house.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
And she was our, we put all kinds of happy signs and sent her letters, and the bitch moved out.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Was it Pauline Hall?

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
If that is not, you know, you think you know somebody, and you move in after a month.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
No, it wasn't Pauline Hall.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm sorry, that's, you know, she just got pissy and moved out.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
She probably moved in with her girlfriend after the second date, like most lesbians.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
That's what I was thinking, she moved out of my village, because I got boring and wouldn't, you know, send her any more letters or peaches.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
And she moved out, bitch.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Lesbians are so needy.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Anyhow.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
Dan's been playing Need for Speed Undercover, and I've been mocking him, because it's fun and easy.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
And then, even though it's not a video game, I've been watching a lot of Supernatural, which is more fun.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Because I got to watch Jensen Ackles naked.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Well, not completely.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
Not completely, but it was a lot more exciting than playing Animal Crossing.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Remind me, this is a show geared towards 16-year-old girls?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Hell no!

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
It's geared towards me.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
It's on the CW.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
We forgive it.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
My gaming week was alright.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I watched my wife play a lot of Animal Crossing, because I'm not allowed near it, I guess.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
It's because you're going to go around and make all of your villagers say nasty things.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
No, she's already done that.

05:40.000 --> 05:47.000
She already has the Genji, the Asian-looking rabbit, saying, you are my best rubber.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
And there was a bunch of stuff that she's done.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
She harasses her animals quite a bit.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Dude, do you know that now it censors things? Like, you can't just have your animals say fuck.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
And I tried to get mine to say poop, and it wouldn't say it. It said, that word is not allowed.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
I have to tell you, though.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
So now he says poop.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
There was a version that got out that was supposed to be some kind of ad.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
They used all the foreign letters that look like other letters.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
They used the accents.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
No, this is different.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
The version that went out to give into a selected group as a marketing tool?

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, it was exactly that. It was using those other letters.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
But one of the animals defaulted, their little catch word was the N word.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
But the way they got around it was they put N and then an I with an accent.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, no, it was someone who was one of the programmers.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I know, I know.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Or they probably copied something to test it.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
They copied a ROM with someone that had already played it and unlocked all the stuff.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
That's what it was. But yeah, they, I don't know.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Should maybe look at that first, you know? Do a little testing.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
But you know they can't make it to level 30 because the boss doesn't show up.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Someone's getting fired.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
Anyways, so other than watching my wife play Animal Crossing, I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV on the 360.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Still doing multiplayer and that, and that's fun.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
And then I decided to try out the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV, which, you know, actually looks pretty good.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
I've heard a lot of people having trouble getting it to run, and I don't understand what they're doing that's making it not run.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Maybe it's because my monitor resolution only goes up to 1440 by 900.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
I'm not sure, but, or 1400 by 900, not 1440.

07:43.000 --> 07:52.000
But it runs pretty good for me. You know, 40, 50 frames per second, and I have a lot of sliders put up all the way.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
Although I don't like the fact that this brand new game does not support SLI, so that's kind of a waste.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
And it's got to be patched in later on.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
You know, absolute laziness, just to get it out.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
But as far as any, you know, I mean, it looks good, it runs pretty good, but it's just Grand Theft Auto IV.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
After playing it for a little bit, you know, kind of starting a new game in there, I was like, wow, this is boring.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
You know, I've already done all this.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
But it looks nice. That's pretty cool. Just waiting for all the mods and stuff to come out.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
And then, other than that, I actually played some Mirror's Edge, and that was a pretty cool game, and I look forward to playing more of that.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Kind of a controversial game, that Mirror's Edge. What do you think?

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
It's fun. It's hard. You know, very, very hard. You'll fall off the building a lot.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
But I think people are pissed off because it's, you know, short.

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
And, you know, sure, I guess it doesn't innovate much, but the way I look at it is, is it fun? Yes.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
So then what are you complaining about?

08:56.000 --> 09:05.000
But, yeah, I'll have to play some more of that. I hear it is really short. In fact, I believe, what was it?

09:06.000 --> 09:20.000
Yahtzee had reviewed it this week, and, man, said he beat it in a day, so it'll be interesting to see how long it takes me to finish it.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
Then I've got a bunch of other games on my plate. In fact, I got another one this week, which I haven't even touched yet, Prince of Persia, so that looks pretty fun, too.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Well, lots of stuff.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
Alright, good times. Well, my gaming week's been Animal Crossing. I finally, you know, a couple weeks ago, I think I mentioned Animal Crossing, but didn't really get too far into it.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I really spent some serious time with Animal Crossing on the Wii this week, and you know what?

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
As much as we're joking around and kind of talking about reliving the thrill of the GameCube version all over again, I have a real hard time recommending this game overall.

09:47.000 --> 09:57.000
Because it's just not enough new for me, and I kind of feel like there's Animal Crossing on the GameCube out there for much cheaper, and you almost get more in it.

09:58.000 --> 10:10.000
But there are some cool things in this game. The problem with this game is it feels like it's just a port of the DS version with a couple extra frills, and it just kind of leaves an Animal Crossing fan really wanting more.

10:10.000 --> 10:18.000
I think they should have taken more risks with this game than they did, although I will say the internet functionality works pretty cool.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
They have worked Wii Connect 24 into it a little bit, so you don't really have to go to somebody's village to send letters and things of that nature, which is an improvement over the DS version.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
But is that really worth the whole new upgrade? Not so much.

10:30.000 --> 10:38.000
And the city is a neat idea, but I think as it brought up on the show a couple weeks ago, it makes you kind of miss it when it would randomly show up in your village.

10:38.000 --> 10:48.000
And they still do randomly show up in your village, actually, but then that also begs the point, what the hell is the city for? I mean, it doesn't really do a whole lot.

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
The city is for getting all of your special characters who only would randomly show up. This is so you can have the convenience of having them all the damn time.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah, I think that's stupid. It takes away the special part of it.

11:00.000 --> 11:08.000
No way. You still get presents floating on balloons, and you still get Gulliver showing up.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
Wild World didn't really hold me all that well, but this one, I'm really digging it.

11:17.000 --> 11:25.000
You know, it's weird. I kind of feel the same way. The DS one got old really fast, but for some reason I have been actually going back to the Wii one to kind of see if there's new stuff, but it's weird.

11:25.000 --> 11:34.000
Like, I say all this, yet I can't in good conscience really recommend this game. You have to really be hardcore about these types of games to get a thrill out of this.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
You have to really be an Animal Crossing fan, of which I was. But I'm still left wanting more.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
For me, it's my sit down for an hour and relax. Seriously.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
I got wow. But I, you know...

11:49.000 --> 11:49.000
Addict?

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
Addict? Yeah, but still. So, I guess that's pretty much all I have to say about Animal Crossing. There's not a lot more I can say about it.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
As far as other new games I've been playing, not a whole lot. Just basically still been using the Xbox 360 for Netflix.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I finally dinged level 80 in World of Warcraft. Thank you very much. Kiss my feet.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Or tell me to get a life, one of the two. But that's been fun.

12:11.000 --> 12:21.000
And the consensus overall amongst at least my guild, which is a casual raiding guild. We were never very hardcore about the endgame.

12:22.000 --> 12:31.000
It's all the people from Final Fantasy XI still. A lot of the same people that were there moved over here. Even Glenn and some of these people from old school.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
That would be the turkey coma.

12:34.000 --> 12:43.000
But yeah, it's been a lot of fun. We're raiding guild. The general consensus is this expansion is better than the last one.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
The stuff they did with it is much better. I love the music.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Are there any new classes? Like new races or anything?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Death Knight is pretty awesome.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Maybe I might have to start playing it again.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
You have to have a level 55 character though to do a Death Knight. Because Death Knight is what they call a hero class.

12:57.000 --> 13:07.000
But they did a great job with it. The voices and stuff, they took the old voices and they made them sound echoey and powerful when your Death Knight talks.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
And it's very sexy.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Rob, can you help me power level?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I can try. I have a level 20-something priest.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I've also been playing Ragnarok and you can play that with me.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
We'll see. I've got a lot of games to play.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
I can get you to level 100 in two hours. I'm not joking.

13:27.000 --> 13:35.000
Speaking of pirate servers, there used to be a bunch for a while. Blizzard went on a huge crackdown this week on the private servers to shut them all down.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Oh yeah, a bunch of the huge ones got shut down.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Some comments from chat room. ActDeft in chat says, Sky, your voice like that? Not sexy.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
I know, you have to have the bassiness and the vocally echo that you can only really do with a computer.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
But I gotta say this, the Lich King sounds awesome.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
And one cool thing that they did with this new expansion is that the Lich King shows up in the earlier content so that it really builds up to this confrontation that you're going to have with Lich King.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
It's not even in the damn game yet.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Because he'll be the last boss they patch in six months from now.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
So they make it more like a conventional RPG? Is that it?

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, you actually see him. They did a much better job with this expansion. I think they learned a lot from the last one.

14:14.000 --> 14:22.000
See, that's the one thing I would really like to see in an MMO is that they have it function like an actual RPG where you have to do point A to point B.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
Where your quests are not just, oh look, this person has question mark over his head and I want money.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
They're getting better with that. The chain quests, the story is getting better. The lore fans are really enjoying their wow this time around.

14:36.000 --> 14:46.000
If that's the case, because honestly, part of the reason why I like Ragnarok so much is that it's just random. It's very social for me.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
And I didn't really enjoy actually playing World of Warcraft because it got really dull.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
You might also be on the wrong server. You should try a roleplay server on WoW. You might have fun.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
I was on a roleplay server actually and I didn't. No one stays in character. It's annoying. I just rather hang out with everybody.

15:03.000 --> 15:12.000
When you finally get the battle and defeat the Lich King, he'll be all, I have one last thing to say. Don't forget Guitar Hero 5 pre-orders and blah blah blah.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
And Starcraft 2 is right around the corner.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Shut up. You forgot Diablo 3.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Oh, and Diablo 3. Warcraft 4.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I like how you tried to do your lazy bass echo.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Your Lich King sounds like a drunken asshole.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Hey, how much have you really gotten to know the Lich King yet?

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
Yes, DJ Tyrant hit the nail on the head. The last expansion had nothing like Wrathgate.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
He says Wrathgate is one of the absolutely best questlines of all time. In-game cutscenes for the win.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
They have cutscenes in the quest this time and they're epic. Epic cutscenes are very epic.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
And Wrathgate was hot. Everybody in our guild, because we're all WoW nerds, was having a gigantic orgasm over the Wrathgate questline because it was awesome.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
See, that sounds like it would be more fun to me just having actual story to follow.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
I don't want to spoil what happens in Wrathgate, but it's pretty amazing. It's pretty epic.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
You get to learn a little more about the phasing technology and it's cool. It's cool.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
Anyhow, let's talk about other games this week and we'll get into the gaming news right after some housekeeping.

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
Tonight's show is a short show. That's because we started late tonight at 7 o'clock due to some personal business.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
We'll be back with our full show next week, so sorry about that.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
Again, you can always listen to us live on All Games Radio, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, immediately following the Bobby Black Wolf show.

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
Speaking of Bobby, he's got a new project and we love Bobby because he always plugs our show on, so we're going to plug him a little bit.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
He is going to start a new show that launches January 9th and it's called Friday Night Gaming.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
It's going to be him and two other people talking in a live program about video games.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Why does this sound familiar to me? No, I'm kidding.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
The niche is that they're actually taping it live at a place called Computer Arena, which is in Roswell, Georgia.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Not the same Roswell where they found aliens.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
They don't keep aliens there. They keep redneck aliens there.

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
But it's actually going to be like they're going to do the interaction with the live crowd as well as the people in the chat room.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
That sounds awesome.

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
They're going to have some neat co-hosts and stuff too, so I don't know how much more I can say because I don't know what he said yet, but it's going to be cool.

17:25.000 --> 17:31.000
So listen to it. FNGlive.net and that starts January 9th on All Games Radio.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Anyhow, that's really all the housekeeping I have tonight.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
So how about some gaming news, even though it's been kind of a slow news week?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
So a short show seems appropriate tonight. Loki, what's up?

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
Well, there is a certain Kingdom Hearts game that's scheduled to come out for the DS and you may have heard about it.

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
Kingdom Hearts 358 slash 2 days is going to be getting a North American release.

17:56.000 --> 18:04.000
I mean, did anyone have any speculation that it wasn't going to get a release here? I mean, seriously.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
And of course, they aren't really seeing when it's coming, but that it is.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Soon.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
I'm guessing next year sometime.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
How about Kingdom Hearts 3?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Never. I don't know.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
They're going to pull a Capcom.

18:22.000 --> 18:34.000
Kingdom Hearts 2, you have to understand, is like Final Fantasy VII or the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII, where it's got to have 90 billion versions for it first before they move on to the next one.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Then they can hoard that one out.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Got to wear out the first prostitute first before they can move on to the next.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Awesome.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
I still want my Kingdom Hearts 3, though, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
That would be very nice with my high-def graphics and hopefully working camera.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Although, Kingdom Hearts 2 wasn't bad as far as the camera goes.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I thought Kingdom Hearts 2 was really solid.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Kingdom Hearts 2 is a very solid game. Good time.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
I need to actually not glitch mine out.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I miss games like that. It's been a little while.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
When did Kingdom Hearts 2 come out? 2005? 2006, maybe?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
I think.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some other news and some other games that are dated that are highly anticipated.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Probably another anticipated game by Jamie. Tekken 6.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
It's coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and it's been confirmed that it will be in the fall 2009 timeframe.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
So the Xbox 360 is supposed to... I don't know if it's getting a slightly earlier launch or something,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
but they're going to hit generally the same time, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
This official announcement was made by Atari, who is publishing the game over in Europe.

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
There you have it. So it's not going to be in the same timeframe as Street Fighter 4,

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
and we know there's not going to be a new Mortal Kombat next year because they just had one this year.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Well then, I don't know. They were putting out those Mortal Kombat games a dime a dozen for a little bit.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
They could still do another Mortal Kombat game because all they would really have to do is port the engine over and add new characters.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
Let's face it, Mortal Kombat and Tekken have very, very different fan bases, so I don't think there's going to be any overlap there anyway.

20:09.000 --> 20:17.000
Very cool. Tekken 6 coming soon. No mention about arcades, though. Sad. I weep for the arcade.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Really? Where is the market going?

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
Well, they do have the arcade version should be already out in Japan, I think. It's not coming over here.

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
Actually, it would probably be in the Namco arcades because I remember when all the last series of Tekken games came out,

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
they were released something like six months before, you know, in Namco arcades before they were in any others,

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
because we had Tekken 3 at my arcade for like ages before anyone else had it.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
But, how about something that isn't related to Tekken? Ooh. WiiWare.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
All right. WiiWare. The stuff I'm boycotting.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Oh, come on, Rob. You know they have the S-

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
True. They did promise that they'd have more storage, but where the fuck's the update?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Probably March.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
That's just like Sony's home. Where the fuck is Sony's home? I can't play it, therefore it's not out yet.

21:11.000 --> 21:19.000
Sorry, Dr. Sakura. What can the more common folk who are not stuck up enough to be boycotting the Nintendo Wii, what can they be playing?

21:19.000 --> 21:28.000
There are more games coming out. There's actually going to be art style Roto Hex.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
That's a remake of the generation's game Dial Hex that was on the Game Boy Advance.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
There's also, that's actually going to be 600 Wii points.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
Episode 4 of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People on its way, and it will have the DANGERESK 3 theme.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Ooh. It's 1000 Wii points.

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
I will allow you to get the Strong Bad game, because it's pretty awesome, but I do want to point out it's also available on PC, if you don't want to put up with the Nintendo Wii.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Just saying. Is all.

22:00.000 --> 22:07.000
You know, I want to know when the hell they're doing an art style version of Dot Stream, because that was the most kickass bit generation game that they released.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
That and Sound Voyager I guess is supposed to be pretty good, but I never picked that one up.

22:11.000 --> 22:23.000
Well, there are also, there's also Bang, which is a shape matching game, and Pit Crew Panic, which should make sense. It's mechanics for broken things.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
That's the one where you fix toilets. Remember there was a giant toilet one?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Well that sounds like fun.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I think we talked about that a little bit.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Let's see here.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Actually, let me get some chat comments before we get to some other stuff here.

22:36.000 --> 22:43.000
Some comments on Kingdom Hearts. VXJ's next V. Kingdom Hearts 2 was released March 28th, 2006.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Actually, I need to credit Noah Bennett for that too, because they both said it.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
It was 2006 when that was released, but Act Def goes on to point out a pretty good point.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Oblivion, Beat Mania, and Kingdom Hearts 2 were all released the same week. That was a very busy week.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Black Wolf wants to point out that Strong Bad is also cheaper on the PC. Good point.

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
And YYR in chat I believe is commenting on the Tekken 6 story. The arcade version will not be released in North America.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
They announced that a while back. I don't remember when. Selected arcades in the USA do have it.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
There's like three in New York. I've played it. It rocks.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
And there will be an upgrade called Bloodline Rebellion. All of that from YYR.

23:20.000 --> 23:28.000
I was going to mention, since we're on the topic of WiiWare, Xbox Live Arcade will be getting Meteos Wars and Power Up forever this week as well.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Really? I love Meteos, but I can't imagine not playing it with a stylus.

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
You know I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi through the good times like Luminous and the bad times like 99 Nights.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
I love that man, and I will get Meteos just because it's Q Entertainment.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
But I really like the DS one. It was kind of underrated. Just saying.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
But I can't imagine not playing that game without the stylus. That's all.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Yeah. Sorry.

23:58.000 --> 24:05.000
Let's see. Well, other things that you can expect this week. It's a very short list, unfortunately, because it is this time of year.

24:06.000 --> 24:13.000
Most games have already been released for Christmas, but there are a few late editions, including Prince of Persia on the PC.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Who's Tardy to the party? Who's stumbling in hungover to the Christmas party?

24:17.000 --> 24:24.000
And Sonic Unleashed on PS3. Both of those versions coming out way later. Well, not really.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Who got toked up off Mad Dog at home?

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Not too late for Prince of Persia, but a couple weeks before Sonic Unleashed at the very least.

24:32.000 --> 24:41.000
Other titles coming out, and I'm not really going to say they're worth mentioning, but Imagine Fashion Party on the Wii. Awesome.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Imagine Saving Your Money. Imagine donating it to charity.

24:45.000 --> 24:54.000
Neopets Puzzle Adventure, which looks like a ripoff of Puzzle Quest, just with Neopets. Does anyone still play Neopets?

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
I was just talking about playing Neopets the other day because I miss playing the little games on the side.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
But you weren't playing them.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Exactly.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Let's see.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
I was talking about Neopets the other day in the mall when I was walking by Claire's. Do they have Claire's nationwide? Is that a nationwide chain?

25:11.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah. Okay. Well, for the international audience, Claire's is like the pretty, pretty princess store. It's the store for 11-year-old girls who want to dress up like princesses.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And you can stop with the comments right now about how much I love Claire's.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
But I was looking in the window, not in the store, but in the window, and they had all these Neopets things for sale.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
And I was telling my friend, I remember when I used to play Neopets. Damn, I needed a life. So, that's all.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
And you don't now?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Hey, watch it.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Core on DS. That'll be coming out.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Let's see.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Hidden Expedition, Amazon.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
And The Tale of Despereaux, both on PC.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
Other titles for this week. Slingo Quest on DS.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
Lego, or was it Left Brain, Right Brain 2 on DS.

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
Driver's Ed Portable. Yes, you can practice your Driver's Ed tests on the DS now.

26:09.000 --> 26:28.000
Build A Lot, which I believe is like a real estate tycoon type game.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
Ski and Shoot, yet another biathlon game.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
God, I just want to play some more biathlon.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Dungeon Maker 2, The Hidden War on PSP.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Kate West, The Vanishing Files on DS.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
And, of course, the big one for the week, Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 on PS2.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
And that is the special edition that comes with the soundtrack.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Because Atlus is really hooking you up.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Yes.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
And I have to say that it's only going to get worse from here.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Oh, because the next few weeks are crap.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Wow. I think Rock Band's in there somewhere, but the rest of the weeks suck.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Alright, well, let's see if things are looking a little brighter in Japan.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And they are. It's a little busier of a week in Japan.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
Strangely enough, usually Japan gets the really cool stuff before we do.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
However, in this case, Japan's getting some of the cool stuff after we are.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Because that happens sometimes when the games are developed over here.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts is going to be released over in Japan on December 11th.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
As is Mirror's Edge in Japan on the Xbox 360.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Also being released December 11th on the PlayStation 3.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Hakuna Matata is getting it.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
That's actually a General Asia release.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Did that game ever get released here in the US?

27:48.000 --> 27:55.000
No, it's going to be released here under, I think Namco is doing it, under National Geographic Africa.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
That's a better name.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Did that game get a facelift all of a sudden, didn't it?

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Yeah, they're changing it up for here. It's not coming over here for a while, though.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I want to see animals eating each other.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
Well, Hakuna Matata gets the General Asia release. It's an English-Chinese version, so you could import it technically, December 11th.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
But I want to see the monkeys throw poo and do it.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
Or you could import the UK version, which I believe is in English, and I think is already out.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Oh, there you go.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Mina no Golf 5 gets a price reduction this week, this Friday.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
Mirror's Edge also comes to the PlayStation 3, and Virtua Fighter also gets a price reduction.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
And a localized version of WALL-E, the video game on PlayStation 3.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
That would be the Disney movie, WALL-E.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
On the Wii, Cooking Mama, Mina to Isho ni Oryoi Takai.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
It's just a price reduction. Fancy name for Cooking Mama 2.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, the Wii edition comes out this week, as does Facebreaker.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
And Major Wii and Samba de Amigo comes out as well.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
Taiko no Tatujin also gets a Wii release, and I know we have some Taiko fans from the music game folks.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
Also, Dark Sakura, are you listening? December 11th, Japan.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, Cross Generation of Heroes comes out.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
So you might want to be looking into imports pretty soon.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
On the PlayStation 2, Galaxy Angel 2 gets a price reduction.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
But, you know what? I think most of our listeners are probably going to be looking for Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Call it a hunch.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Oh no! I'm sorry, that's the US release. My bad.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Sometimes some US dates sneak into my list here. My bad.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
Well, I have dates for our UK people.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Wait, DS, real quick.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
Elibits this week. And a game called Penguin. No Bondai.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Okay, I'm done.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
No, that's it.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
No, I'm done.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Are you sure? Are you positive?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Okay.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
And Wall-E.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
On the DS.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Ferret! Return the ferret. I command thee.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I command thee.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
You do need to put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it you can yank it back.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
It's a bungee ferret.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Not that I should be encouraging you to do this.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Thank you for...

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
You know, there was a totally random conversation that we had yesterday.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
It didn't involve ferrets?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
No, it didn't involve ferrets. It involved small animals.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
We were talking about that they should breathe like micro monkeys and call them, like, monkeys.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
That would be funny.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
I don't know where that came from. We were at a really boring Christmas party at my dad's house.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
We're out of alcohol. Let's eat sugar and brainstorm.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
You know what they need to do?

30:46.000 --> 30:53.000
Wait, since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and all this good Xbox Live thing, shouldn't they have a game called Bungee Ferret Tossing?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
It could be like Orange Lawns Radio presents Bungee Ferret Tossing.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Add this to the list of Orange Lawns Radio Dream Games.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
No, add this to the list of Orange Lawns Radio Reality Games.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
We need to tell Mikey about the Dream Games.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
We need to learn how to program or something.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
We have a series of games that we're mostly developing.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Take a class on programming.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Learn it!

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Absorb via osmosis.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
You can learn it.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Anyhow, sorry.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
You're a towel.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
UK dates, please.

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
11th, Luminous Supernova on PlayStation 3. That makes me go squee and get happy in places.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
On the 12th, some stuff.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Prince of Persia for PC, the Magic Roundabout.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
For people in America who don't know what a roundabout is, Traffic Circle.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
I have to translate.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Things I fucking hate when I'm driving downtown.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Dude, I fucking love them.

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
I love them. Because at my college we had one and it was big and had a park in it and my friends swore up and down that demons live there.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I'm not joking.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
You're the most random fucking person on the planet sometimes.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
I'm not joking.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Demons were living in the roundabout and this has what to do with video gaming?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
The Magic Roundabout!

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
They're magic!

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
I do miss that...

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Rob is red.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
This show sucks.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
You suck!

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Laughter is warm and we're not.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
One thing we forgot to mention, the studio is freezing cold tonight.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Keep in mind, we're Californians and we're pretty spoiled.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
So I'm sure this is nothing. This is a summer day in Alaska right now.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
But we are freezing cold in here right now.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
So just wanted to get that out there.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
So if we seem kind of cracked out, we are.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
And also coming out, Your Mom the Game. Done.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
Well, hopefully Your Mom the Game lasts longer than Mirror's Edge.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Longer than the player.

33:03.000 --> 33:08.000
Loki. Sorry. Save our show.

33:09.000 --> 33:16.000
I was looking at, there was a game I used to play that I thought, it's not roundabout, but it sounded just like it.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
And it was, I was just trying to find a name for it.

33:21.000 --> 33:29.000
It used to be called, the one that came over here was Felony 179, but it might actually have been called roundabout in the UK or something.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
Really fun game where you break stuff with cars.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
Yeah, so another thing that's totally on topic with breaking stuff with cars.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
Mama is gardening now. Yes, gardening Mama.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
Yet another thing that they're trying to get guys to play.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
First they get them cooking and then they get them planting stuff in the garden.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Wait a minute, this is some type of secret plot, isn't it?

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
To get men to do the things that women are supposed to be doing.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
What's next? Laundry Mama?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
I will not stand for it.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Don't worry, Mama will wash it.

34:08.000 --> 34:15.000
The next one was, what was it, not Pet City Mama. It has nothing to do with pets though. Pet Shop Mama.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Poop Scoop Mama?

34:17.000 --> 34:25.000
I don't know, see I understand the whole gardening thing because people grow fruits and vegetables in their garden and they can use them to cook.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
The Pet Shop Mama, I don't like where that's going. I don't like associating the pet shop with food.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
But food is delicious and some pets are tasty.

34:36.000 --> 34:44.000
That is a little strange that Cooking Mama will work in the pet shop part time and then she cooks things and PETA has a problem with it the other half of the time. Just saying.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Okay, that PETA thing was bullshit.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
That's right, you were gone when all that went down.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Oh, no, remember I posted on my Twitter.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
That was the week we were all off, was the PETA thing.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
I posted on my Twitter about this.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
And I think we talked about it briefly last week on the show and I was like, ah, if Jamie was here she'd say it's bullshit.

35:01.000 --> 35:14.000
It's bullshit! Fuck you, PETA. My pre-emptive F you goes to PETA, may you get fucked with a steak.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
A big, bloody cow rib.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
We're really mature here on Orange Lounge Radio.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
Okay, she really just said go fuck yourself with a steak. Am I not mistaking?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
No, no, no, no, no.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
With ribs.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Ribs.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Amazing.

35:43.000 --> 35:49.000
Hey, we have some local news here. You know, sometimes we make the news with some things that go on locally.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
And you know the game America's Army? Have you heard of the game America's Army?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Yes.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
It's kind of a game that the Army put out to, you know, kind of be like other first person shooters, quote unquote.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Although I would hope the violence isn't quite as glorified.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
But it's kind of a recruitment tool for the Army, America's Army, obviously.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
You know, the game is free to play.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
And it's a fairly popular game, you know, because it's, again, pretty old.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
It's pretty old, too. I mean, the last game that they put out sucked.

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
Well, get this. Right here in Rancho Cordova, where we tape our show, a suburb of Sacramento, where the OLR Studios is,

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
not even that far from where we tape, only like one exit up the freeway,

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
there was a U.S. Army video game tournament for the game America's Army that happened right here in our neck of the woods.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
Apparently, there were protests that ended up making the news here locally.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Some Veterans for Peace were out there actually protesting, and they have some pictures.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
And this guy is holding the sign saying, real war is hell, don't enlist.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
And the guy who is the president of this organization, John C. Reiger, the Sacramento branch,

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
he said, it's like giving candy to kids. It's sort of like military pedophilia, in a way, preying on our young people.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
He really did use that phrase, military pedophilia. That's the quote he used, not me.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
So, there you go.

37:07.000 --> 37:13.000
And kind of the counter quote there was from Victor Ferrer, who is a sergeant in the Army.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
He said, the event is nothing more than an opportunity for people to become familiar with the Army.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
They also wanted to clarify the tournament was open to players 17 and over.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
Anyone under 17 had to have a parent or guardian there in order to compete in the tournament.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
And sign up for the military.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
If we had known it was going on, we would have gone out there.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
No, I would not have.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
I would have played.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
I don't think people think of Orange Lounge Radio when they think of America's Army, the game.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
They think of the O.L. Army.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
Usually not the type of game we cover, but I would have gone out there just to kind of check it out.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Did you see what SSG100Matt said in the chatroom?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
No.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
The winner of the tournament gets to go to Iraq.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
So, it's like a twisted version of, you know, what the hell was that?

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
God, why am I drawing a blank no? 80s movie.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Last Starfighter. Sorry.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Dude, The Last Starfighter was awesome.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Yes, it's like The Last Starfighter, just more death.

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
I've got a friend of mine in Iraq right now, and I would not want anyone to go over there, so.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
And to go back to what I was talking about when she was mentioning Roundabout, or Roundabouts or whatever.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Roundabout.

38:22.000 --> 38:29.000
Yes, Roundabouts. Well, the game I was thinking was called Runabout, and it was, yeah, the U.S. title was Felony 1179.

38:29.000 --> 38:36.000
Fun game. I got a bus stuck in a subway tunnel in that game, and it spun out of control until it took off like a helicopter.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
Not to say that the game was, you know, glitchy or anything.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Good times. Good times.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
How about some more gaming news?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Do I gotta?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
You gotta.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
Well, this is actually some pretty good news for all of our Suicoden fans.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
We are getting a...

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
All 108 of you.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
108 of you. There's a joke there.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
See if you can spot it.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
I haven't even played the damn game, and I get the joke. Thanks to Shane, thank you.

39:05.000 --> 39:14.000
But for all of our friends in Europe, Suicoden, I guess it's pronounced T-Christ, is coming out on the DS in March next year.

39:14.000 --> 39:25.000
And basically the game is, you start off as this unnamed person who's in a security force who has to recruit 108 heroes to battle the one king.

39:26.000 --> 39:41.000
And you have a four-person party, and it's Suicoden, and you can go over the Wi-Fi to send characters into different games or other worlds so they can get new items, different quests, meet new people.

39:41.000 --> 39:49.000
And this one actually just came out in Japan, and we here in America are supposed to be getting it in February.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
But sorry, people in Europe, you've gotta wait. Or import!

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
But it should be noted, this is not like your typical Suicoden game. It's more of a tactical-type game.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Yeah, it's more tactics.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
They call it a community RPG.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
So it's really a mini men online role-playing girls game.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Hmm.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Interesting.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
With tactics!

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
And stuff.

40:15.000 --> 40:21.000
Speaking of stuff, Atari has announced a brand new game that they're working on with Tetsuya Mizuguchi.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
It's a music game with the working title QJ.

40:25.000 --> 40:43.000
And of course, you know, their Q Entertainment is known for their games that kind of blend in pretty cool musical aspects to it, so making, I don't know, a musical game is not necessarily a bad thing and not really unexpected.

40:44.000 --> 40:51.000
Something else to look forward to, I guess. I guess we'll find out a little bit more about this later on.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I would be more worried if it was called LLQJ.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Nice.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I've had sugar today, Rob.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
And how?

41:03.000 --> 41:03.000
And how?

41:04.000 --> 41:11.000
Well hey, I'm all over this. You talk music, you talk Mizuguchi, Q Entertainment, you know I'm gonna check it out because I'm a whore for everything that man puts out.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
So you know I'm excited about this one if I didn't already have everything that this is gonna be offering.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
But Atari is going to be bundling several of Mizuguchi's games together.

41:21.000 --> 41:28.000
Res HD, Luminous Live, and Every Extend Extra Extreme are all gonna be retailed together in one retail package.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
It's gonna be called Q3, which is supposed to be some type of term meaning cubed, I guess. Whatever.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
Or you could do San-Q-3-thank-you-three.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Oh that's a cute idea.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Because it was the same pun with QQQ?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Okay.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
San-Q-thank-you.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
I get it, I get it.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
Well you can also do, I mean, you know, to the third power is cubing something, so.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Right, right.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
But that's cute. Either way, I didn't even think of the San-Q thing. That's pretty cute.

41:58.000 --> 42:05.000
But anyway, you know, I'm sure a lot of our listeners probably already downloaded these games, but this is good news for those that are the more casual Xbox 360 people that don't take it online.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
I would get this.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Yeah, I mean.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Because we haven't downloaded all this yet.

42:08.000 --> 42:16.000
And here's your perfect opportunity, because, you know, even though the, it's kind of repackaged of old material, you're talking about some really good old material.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
It's ResHD, it's Luminous Live, it's Every Extent Extra Extreme.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
And it's, it's mostly, the download content for Luminous is all a part of this too.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
So it's all in one nice little package.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
So, very cool.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Does it actually save any money, though, over downloading everything with points?

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
I don't think it's gonna save very much. I don't see a price point listed here.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Probably worth all the download content for, like, Luminous.

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
Yeah, with the download content included, I think this is actually a pretty good package deal.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
I mean, it saves you time and effort, really, you know, if just that.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
It's based on your hard drive if you're crunched, I guess.

42:48.000 --> 42:55.000
Exactly. It's saving room, and it's, you know, putting, you know, and there's also people who, you know, may have an Xbox who may not necessarily have, like, an internet connection.

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
I know people who were like that, you know, who don't have it hooked up all the time.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
It's a good way to, you know, get all the download content and not have to worry about it.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
True, true.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
So, that helps.

43:08.000 --> 43:17.000
Well, I mean, there's no reason for me to get this, because I always bottled this shit the first day it came out, but I'm glad to see that there's enough faith in the product that they're giving it a retail release.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
I mean, who would have thought, years ago when Rez was on Dreamcast, it was kind of a cult title? Like, not everybody really knew about it.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
Who knew that it would be kind of resurfacing in the mainstream again today, if that makes any sense? I don't know.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
I kind of wish they'd do a true sequel to Rez. Wouldn't that be hot?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Well, yeah, that would actually be pretty cool, I think.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
We'll see.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Well, how about some other stuff?

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
How about something that's gonna make my soul hurt?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
But the soul still burns.

43:48.000 --> 43:55.000
No, my soul isn't burning, it's fucking freezing and throwing up in the bathroom like a bad vodka hangover.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Okay, it's not that cold in here.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
No, I'm not talking about in here, I'm talking about the King of Fighters movie.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
King of Fighters movie?

44:03.000 --> 44:12.000
Um, they are already, Gordon Chan is directing it. There's not too many details, but they're sad.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
And this is basically what was put out saying about it.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
It looks like the King of Fighters movie will introduce a new science fiction spin into the setting.

44:22.000 --> 44:28.000
That right there is enough to make me vomit. It's enough to make my heart work.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Fighters in space!

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
Pretty much that's it. They're supposed to be going to different dimensions and different worlds.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Um, hi, the story works like it did before, don't fuck with it!

44:40.000 --> 44:46.000
They're all stuck in, like, the Neo Geo world. They have to go to different games and destroy the characters and that.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
It's like the crap they tried to do with the last Mortal Kombat movie?

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
No! Don't ruin my movie, please!

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
King of Fighters was like a classic staple in fighting games for me.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
I mean, I grew as a gamer when King of Fighters came out and expanded my mental universe.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
And made me realize that, yes, SNK can do a good fighting game other than Samurai Shodown.

45:12.000 --> 45:21.000
And what kind of cherished childhood memory would it be if they didn't come and rape it later on in movie form?

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
Well, at least it's not being directed by Uwe Boll, so that's good.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Well, I'm glad I have something to be thankful for this holiday season.

45:30.000 --> 45:35.000
But the stars of the movie are Maggie Q, Sean Ferris, William Lee, and Ray Park.

45:36.000 --> 45:36.000
Who?

45:37.000 --> 45:37.000
Wait, Ray Park!

45:38.000 --> 45:38.000
Darth Maul!

45:39.000 --> 45:39.000
Darth Maul, yes.

45:40.000 --> 45:40.000
And Seth Rogen.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
And what?

45:42.000 --> 45:42.000
And Toad!

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Toad, yeah.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Do you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad?

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Same thing that happens to everything else.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
It was awesome when Storm said it!

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
No, it wasn't!

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Actually, it wasn't. It really, really wasn't.

45:58.000 --> 46:04.000
Okay, do not get this couch started on Halle Berry and how much ass she sucks.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Oh, but Jamie Catwoman! No, wait.

46:07.000 --> 46:12.000
I've blocked that out of my memory. It does not exist as a part of my universe.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
Hey, it could be worse, okay? They could have had Tyra Banks play the part or something like that.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Tyra Banks has more personality, thank you.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
She would have brought the much needed sass to the part.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
She would have brought the sass and she would have brought...she just would have brought it.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
When Angela Bassett declined, it was over. I mean, really.

46:30.000 --> 46:39.000
But you know, Angela Bassett, I do agree to an extent that she was...she's done an X-Men movie ten years ago.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
She was Storm. That would have been it.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
But ten years ago, she was Tina Turner.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
That's true.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
If anyone can pull off the legs, then, you know.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Well, anyway.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
Okay, sorry. When I'm singing Tina Turner songs, it's really time for us to get back to gaming news.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
Is it? Yes. Let's talk about Activision.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
We've been putting that in an uncomfortable place.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
Something I'm completely used to by now.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
So, Activision. They have a lot of brand new stuff coming next year, including...

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
Oh, gosh. What would it be without another Call of Duty game?

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
Yes, there's another Call of Duty game coming out next year.

47:23.000 --> 47:30.000
It will hit Fall 2009, and apparently it's going to be back in Infinity Ward's hands again, so we can stop bitching about it.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
And then also, they're going to be doing a brand new Bond game, because, well...

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
It's another franchise that they have to pump out one new game a year.

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
And then finally, they're going to do something a little different with the next Tony Hawk game,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
which apparently is going to not be played with a controller,

47:49.000 --> 47:57.000
and will be a game that you're not going to be playing with a controller in your hands, according to them.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
And of course, what everybody's been speculating, the rumors have been around for a long time now,

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
that it's going to be actually some sort of motion-controlled skateboard thing.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Which, at that point, I have to ask...

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Why don't you just go skateboard, then?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
If you're not actually going to be playing with a controller, just go skateboard.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
I mean, you're almost there anyways, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
The air conditioning. Carpet.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
I know. But still. Skateboarding.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
I mean, once you get to the point where it's so much like the thing that you're doing,

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
that you're actually doing it, you might as well just go actually do the sport.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
And I'm sure this forgot to mention that they're probably going to be pumping out like four more Guitar Hero games,

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
because, you know, they haven't buried that into the ground enough yet.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
Oh, and Bizarre Creations. You may remember them from the Project Gotham Racing series.

48:52.000 --> 48:58.000
They're actually working on another racing game as well that's going to be racing and driving focused.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
You know, because that would be any other racing game.

49:03.000 --> 49:09.000
And they're also working on one that's going to be similar to Mario Kart meets Forza.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
What the hell? Mario Kart meets Forza?

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
Maybe it's like a Mario Kart type of game, but you actually tune your karts and like what weapons and stuff are on it and that kind of thing.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
How about a cute Forza game? That would be cute.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
They already got Coral Q.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
You know, if you want your Q race, the Coral Q franchise.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
Did you see that they're actually putting out, and I don't know why they've done this over here,

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
apparently EA doesn't know how to make games for the Wii,

49:35.000 --> 49:46.000
but they've decided that the next best idea to bringing NASCAR to the Wii instead of actually, I don't know, bringing NASCAR to the Wii is NASCAR Karts.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
What?

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Yeah, it's like Mario Kart with NASCAR drivers.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
What?

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Yup.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Interesting.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
That's what EA thinks of you Wii owners. You're just little kids that don't know any better.

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
They won't give you any serious games, except for Boom Blocks. That's not really that serious.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
That's sad.

50:10.000 --> 50:17.000
Well, while Loki was reading us that last little story there, I actually was working on my portal that lets us peer inside Dark Sakura's alternate universe.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
What?

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
So I actually have a clip from Dark Sakura's alternate universe where Tyra Banks is Storm.

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
In fact, I'm going to show you how fantastic my underwear make me feel!

50:29.000 --> 50:45.000
I really feel crazy standing up here in my underwear. I'm used to doing this on a, you know, a Victoria's Secret runway or in a catalog, but not on the Tyra show.

50:45.000 --> 51:07.000
So I need a little help. Everybody, on the count of 1, 2, 3, I want you to lose those under-the-canopy robes right now. Free that underwear everybody!

51:07.000 --> 51:36.000
This is too much tire for this show, only the best part is coming up, lord, it's a panty

51:36.000 --> 52:01.000
party

52:01.000 --> 52:19.000
party

52:19.000 --> 52:34.000
in

52:34.000 --> 52:53.000
it

52:53.000 --> 53:12.000
is

53:12.000 --> 53:31.000
a

53:31.000 --> 53:56.000

53:56.000 --> 54:16.000

01:12:36.000 --> 01:13:00.000
party party party party party

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Someone stole the Metroid, and she had to go back after her baby.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Same as this jellyfish-looking baby.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Digitized voice for Super Nintendo, hi!

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Anyway.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I'm not sure if this game is sexy or not, but I think it's funny that the Metroid producer was busy working on the Virtual Boy at the time and didn't have much involvement with this.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.000
But this is a game that I'll get Dan to play, and I'll just sit back on the couch going,

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Go this way, go that way, go this way, go that way.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
That's really freaking cool. You're better at this than I am.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Let me know my thoughts on this game. I love this game more than most other games.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Pretty much any other game. I love this game so much. I think it's, you know.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I've already been caught up in the controversy about how much I love this game. I won't repeat it, but let's just say I love this game.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
This game is electronic mookie. So, um, what?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It is! It is sex and pixels. It really is.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Without being dirty.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Of course, we all know that this game has been the big influence for the current series of Castlevania games.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000
You know, with that same type of map system running all over the place shooting stuff, except using a whip.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It also is one of, it's actually stated in my resource that it was a contributor to the speedrun phenomenon.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Because you did actually, for beating the game in different ways, you got different rewards, different things.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000
You can speedrun through Super Metroid like a mofo if you know where you're going and what you're doing.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I've seen this game beaten in person on a major speedrun, and it was beautiful.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
So, it's really awesome-tastic.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Super Metroid game of the week.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
You have to get it to the point where it plays the theme.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I think it's just going to start the first level.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Here we go.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Right?

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Yeah.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I love this game.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I do love this game. I want to play this game right now!

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
The music in this game was freaking fantastic.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It really was.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:47.000
You know what the Nintendo Sound Processor was eventually what was incorporated, if I'm right, it's what led to the one in the PlayStation.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Because Sony made Nintendo Sound Processor.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:58.000
You know, I really just want to say, because we do have some younger folks who listen to this show who weren't a teenager or junior high or whatever when this game first came out.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Really owe it to yourself to check out this game. This is gaming at some of its greatest.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And as much crap as I've given the whole Chrono Trigger vs. Super Metroid thing that came up totally unnecessarily months ago on this show.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Play Chrono Trigger 2. I mean, they're both wonderful games, but I love Super Metroid so much.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:28.000
See, if they were smart they would just go back and do, remember the same treatment that they basically did with Wario Land Shake It, just do that for Super Metroid or just a Metroid game.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Make a really awesome looking 2D Metroid game.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And not on the DS.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And not on the DS.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I mean, seriously, no one's going to care if it's a 2D game. No one's not going to buy your game just because, oh it's 2D, I don't want to play a 2D game.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Well, you know what, people will play a 2D game and they will like it.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Look at a game like Braid, you can still do awesome things in 2D.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Look at Castlevania games, they sell hotcakes on the DS.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And they would sell hotcakes on the Wii if they put out a really cool looking 2D Castlevania game.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:09.000
You don't have to go all 3D, just make it fun, make it exciting, that's all you have to do.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Alright, well we are going to go, hey you know that Metroid Zero game, even though it was on the Game Boy Advance, was pretty awesome.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Like that was a great, like, successor in a way to Super Metroid, if that makes sense.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And they revisited the original Metroid but changed just enough that it really felt all new again, which I thought was kind of awesome.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
So, there you go.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It's open, I'm just now seeing though that our time might have run out on him.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Whoops! We'll see.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I'm curious if the Skype line is going to work tonight or if I'm late.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Today was the day it runs out, so we may or may not be able to get calls tonight.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
1877-GAME-OLR.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I'm going to try calling it myself real fast and see if it works.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:59.000
We have a call, oh that call is coming in on Skype though.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
GAME-OLR.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Let me see if it works, I'm calling it myself.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I do this live on air test that's very professional?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Yes.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Real quick stuff, just confirming a lot of the rumors that we had from a couple weeks ago.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Uncharted 2, Among Thieves, was announced.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Remember that thing that supposedly leaked out from Sony saying that there was a new Uncharted game?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Well, apparently it's true, so I wonder if the rest of it will be true as well.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Another big game that we should have mentioned during the show, but Killzone 2 finally got a release date.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
February 27th.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:45.000
If there's ever going to be an epic first person shooter game for the PS3, it's definitely Killzone 2.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
They're kind of Gears of War if you want to look at it that way.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Kind of interesting, someone's bringing Catan to the PS3 as well.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Game Republic is bringing out that game.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
It's actually going to be a different version that was on the 360.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Kind of like this one better.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
No word on when that's going to be out though.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
There's also a brand new game that's been announced by Fifth Cell,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.000
the developer that put out that game, Drawn to Life, and also Lock's Quest.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
It's going to be a little bit similar to Drawn to Life.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
What it is, is it's actually an action puzzler game,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000
and you can type in words, or you write in words,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
and it will create objects for you based on what you write in.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
So for example, you have to collect these stars throughout the game,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
and you can write in ladder, and a ladder will spawn.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
You can climb the ladder to get the star, or you write in football,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
and you can throw a football at the tree, or beaver,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
and the beaver will chew down the tree.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Apparently there's such an enormous dictionary of words in this game,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
you can literally put whatever you want.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I mean, just from ordinary objects to the most obscure thing you can think of.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And they promise apparently sharks with lasers on their heads.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
So that's kind of neat.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And then finally, I'd like to mention that apparently,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000
according to YYR in chat, he is having a contest.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Oh, I was going to read this.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Well, fine, you go ahead and read this.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
No, go ahead.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
No, no, no, go ahead.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
No, no, go ahead.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Okay, I will say this.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
The contest actually doesn't start until Tuesday.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
We're giving you a sneak peek right here, Snake 360 contest.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And you can win, or there's $450 in prizes to be given away.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And they have three different challenges,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Race to Fanatic, Survivor Challenge, and Battle Video Exhibition.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And of course, different prizes.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Looks like the prizes for each category include either 4,000 points card,

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
or one year of live.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Lots of stuff being given away, so that's kind of cool.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And apparently, the contest starts on Tuesday, ends on Sunday, January 11th.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And we can really say, and truthfully say,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
you heard it here first, because Aaron, the author of the game,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
just put this up and sent us a message first,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
because we had him on our show a couple weeks ago,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
and he hasn't forgotten about us.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Awesome guy.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Thank you very much.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And I don't know if we're automatically ineligible,

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
but I'm thinking the Battle Video might actually be kind of fun to try.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
We might have to do that.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I don't know.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So we'll see.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
All right.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
The Skype line, the number is not working tonight,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
but you can still call us via Skype, actual Skype.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I saw at least one call trying to come through earlier,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
which I will take if it comes in again.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Otherwise, sorry kids, you have to be on actual Skype tonight.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
But the Skype line is open at Orange Launch Radio.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Did you have anything else you want to add real quick?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Well, no.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Wow, all right.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I was looking to see if I had any more stories.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I do.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
They had a, what is it, Half-Life remake called Black Mesa

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
that they released a trailer video for last week right after the show.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It looks so amazing.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
It's using the source engine.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
It's basically just a remake of the first Half-Life game.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
That sounds pretty fun.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
It was pretty cool.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And then, of course, Gran Turismo 5 apparently is on track for Holiday 09.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Funny because I thought that was supposed to be out this year,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
but, you know, hey, I guess it's still on track to come out someday.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
So is home.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Hey, we got a call.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
What is this?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Hello, Orange Launch Radio Land.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Apparently I'm very special tonight,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
and the one voice of the crowd or something like that.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Are you the only one wanting to call in tonight in chat?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I don't know.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
You were saying something that only one person called,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
and I know I called.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Well, no, as one person was trying to get through,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I was doing all those tests,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
but stupid me, the Skype number expired today,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
and I got so busy I just never renewed it.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Are you going to be able to get the same one back,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
or am I going to have to update what the toll free goes to?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
No, we'll be able to get the same number back.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I'm not worried about that.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I'm going to wait for 90 days,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
because I've let it expire before.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Live radio, folks.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
One radio.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Yeah, I know.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
You know what's funny?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's the charm of Orange Launch Radio.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Kind of on the same old note there,

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
GoDaddy's been emailing me like a bitch to get me to renew O-L-R-E,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
and I was like, oh, I'm just going to let it expire.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
They automatically renewed it for me and charged me the money.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Oh, nice.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I think the E3 site we had also,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I think that finally actually expired,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
because we never did anything with it.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Oh, my goodness.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Anyway, I do want to say real quick,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
sorry, Jason, interrupt,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
but we never gave the damn website for the Snake 360 contest,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
because we're bad hosts.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
www.snake360.com slash contest,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
where you can see all the information about it,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
and it's a great community game.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Check it out.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Jason, what were you calling about tonight?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Sorry.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
When DJ Hero and all that stuff was kind of coming up,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I was just kind of going around looking for information,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and I pulled up a Kotaku post about it with the first notes on it,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000
and the picture of it reminded me of a story that I don't believe I've told on here.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Before I get into that, I was just going to kind of ask,

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
there's been a screenshot that makes DJ Hero look like Guitar Hero

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
with a DJ floating next to the chart,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
but we don't really know anything about the game itself for the controller, do we?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
There were some rumors about the controller a while back.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Wasn't the controller supposed to be like a giant turntable

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
with kind of like buttons around it or something like that?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I seem to remember there was a story a couple,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
yeah, something like, it's not going to look like Beatmania.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
That's for sure.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
That's a common misconception about it is that,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
oh, well, they're going to rip off Beatmania.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
No, it doesn't look like they really want to go for that exact same game.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
It's going to be different, it looks like.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Guitars and drums can't exactly be made original

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
when they're supposed to be guitars and drums,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
but DJ decks have a lot of liberty to play with.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
So the Kotaku entry that I was talking about,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
you know that Joystick and Kotaku and everybody else

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
picks a featured picture that I've been,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
that my Mario Kart code has been so greatly featured on three years ago.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
They have this little actual DJ pioneer deck

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
that reminded me of something I saw at Best Buy.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Our Best Buy opened up a musical instruments corner of the building,

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
and when we were there the last time,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
we kind of poked our heads in there and were killing some time.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
They had a bunch of drum kits, digital drum kits laid out.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:25.000
They had drawers of DJ kits with full-size digital turntable decks, I guess,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
and little miniature turntable decks with the crossfader and the,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
if there's a specific name for the centerpiece,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
far be it for me to know what it's called.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
But I was sitting there and I was kind of playing around with it

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
and I was thinking to myself, you know, this is really cool.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
This is actually kind of fun.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000
You have the full-size LP deck with a little slot reader on the side

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
to stick your CD in and then do the same things you would do with vinyls.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Whether that's better or not, I leave that to the purists.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Anyways, I'm kind of looking forward to seeing more with what comes about with DJ Hero.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I think we are all on pins and needles about DJ Hero, Jason,

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
but the sad thing is I don't think we're going to see it until E3.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I think it's going to be Activision's big thing at E3 next year

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
because with Guitar Hero, we know that shit.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
They say, new Guitar Hero game. We're like, whoopty shit.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
We know what this is all about.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
DJ Hero is going to be real new, you know what I mean?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Yeah, and you can draw the parallels to everything you want that's already come out.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
B-Mania and Crackin' DJ.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I seem to remember there was something even more obscure that I can't think of.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Crackin' DJ was fun and all, but it just wasn't a real deck besides...

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Okay, it was two turntables and a crossfader.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Two turntables and a microphone.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
But none of the effectors, none of the volumes, none of that.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I'll also remember this, Jason. 98% of gamers haven't played any of those games you just mentioned, too.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
But DJ Hero really has the potential to kind of...

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
The foot is already in the door, so to speak.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Because the same thing could have been said for Guitar Hero.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It's going to get shelf space right next to Guitar Hero.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Which is a big shelf.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Think about how really huge Guitar Hero's gotten.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I was watching a commercial for Best Buy the other day where they were talking about...

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
They were trying to do some type of like, oh, it's your hometown electronics store.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
And they were talking about Killeen, Texas, which is funny because it's making me think of Travis from Understation Live.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
But they were talking about Texas, and they were talking about like, oh, it's a big military base.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
And this guy was talking about, oh, and you know, sometimes women will come in here and want to know,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
where's that guitar game for my husband who's been away?

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And I'm thinking like, wow.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
That really just kind of put it into perspective.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:36.000
It really has kind of crossed over now into that guitar game that every family has to have, if that makes sense.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000
That's because they picked music that people actually know and care about to some extent.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:48.000
But DJ Hero is going to have a huge foot in the door because of the mainstream success of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, really.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Yeah.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And the fact that they're actually going for names like T.S.O. and anybody else that they're going to sign and announce later on down the line.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Who would have thunk it when we started this show a few years ago that music games would become so huge, huh?

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Especially after we moved away from just music games.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Well, that's what did it.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Remember there was no new DDR for like years and years and literally two weeks after we said,

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
oh, we're going to move away from the music game things and talk about general gaming.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Supernova!

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Supernova is coming out.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
We're back!

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Bastards.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
All right.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Anyway.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Konami exists to spite you.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Konami does exist to spite us sometimes.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I really truly believe that.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I think the most interesting part about all this is the Guitar Hero arcade machine, arcade cabinets that was talked about a few weeks back.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Yeah.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:44.000
And just the fact that they can do, especially with the fact that Guitar Hero itself went World Tour and the fact that apparently Konami is working with Activision for the cabinets.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000
If that didn't just signal Rock Revolution's death that we already knew was coming, what does?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:02.000
But just the fact that World Tour exists and DJ Hero was acquired by Activision, should I say Freestyle Games was acquired by Activision who was making DJ Hero.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:14.000
The big linked performance games that we always wanted out of DDR, 2DX, Guitar Freaks, Drummania, and optionally Keyboardmania, but that died pretty quick,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.000
can actually come stateside, stateside music, and possibly do a lot for arcades for all we know.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
That would be freaking expensive though.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
You know, I said this a long time ago on the show and I truly believe it.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:32.000
You know, Harmonix and these developers were willing to take the risk that Konami wasn't and look where it got them.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:46.000
And Konami should be kicking their own ass right now and if they didn't have the, if there weren't patent laws and all that stuff so that they could essentially ride the coattails now of someone else's success from their idea, which is odd, there wouldn't be a lot going for them right now in the music game world.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:53.000
As much as we can hate on them for filing those lawsuits, the fact that they're working together for an arcade machine is kind of redeeming.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I want to quickly say this comment, Jason, before we let you go, get your reaction to this. Tiger Claw in chat says,

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:04.000
If you want to play your own version of DJ Hero, you can download a DJ mixing program on your PC and mix your own MP3s.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
But that's boring because that's not telling me how to do it.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I can't play without arrows on the screen.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
There's no arrows to step on. Or whatever.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Alright, Jason, we gotta let you go to get a couple more calls, but you have a good one, buddy.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Giant dork fest!

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Alright, yeah, that's the show. Alright, later dude.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Night, guys.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
At first you told me there was no mailbag, now you're telling me there's a mailbag.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I didn't think we'd have time.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Alright, well, we'll do it. Since no one else is calling on Skype, we'll close Skype.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:09.000
You know what, we need to actually have theme music for the Skype thing, and we need to play Bananaphone.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
You know what's funny? That was the fortune cookie message last week, when you weren't here, yes.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
How funny.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Alright, yeah, I thought Rama was calling in to give a review on something. Where is he?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Oh, because he's on the phone. Oops. Sorry, Rama. Love you.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
But we love the mailbag, too!

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Mailbag. OrangeLunchRadio.com, which apparently we are doing this segment tonight, although I only saw one email in there when I went in earlier.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Saw us send an email.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Hello, OLR buddies and friends. It's actually titled Why Hello There, OLR.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I finally joined the new millennium and got an Xbox 360.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I've survived solely on DS and PSP for the longest time, and I have to say that it's nice to have a non-portable gaming system again for the first time in nearly three years.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So far, I only have Guitar Hero 3 and Guitar Hero Aerosmith. My band's names are Spock's Eyebrows and Doodly Ladies, respectively.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:06.000
But I hope to remedy this soon. What are some good Xbox 360 games that I should look into purchasing?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Fable!

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Fable 2 is kind of evil, but it is definitely entertaining. You can beat up chickens.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Please go on Xbox Live Arcade and look at all the sex that's on there, like Rez.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Symphony of the Night?

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
If you don't already have that on PlayStation 1, definitely Symphony of the Night.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Go look at how much sex is available for cheap on Xbox Live Arcade. That's where you need to go.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:42.000
And, um, oh shoot, there's also, um, there's of course the Rock Band series, and, um, Brainfart.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Brainfart the game!

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Guitar Hero?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
She already said she had them!

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Oh yeah.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Okay.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So, moving forward, since Jamie mentioned playing Order of Ecclesia, I figured I would quickly plug the review I did of that game.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:03.000
It's great! And can be found on my blog at www.avengerstower.com.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
The game is great, or the review is great?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Both.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Order of Ecclesia is definitely a very difficult game compared to earlier Castlevania games, but the difficulty of the game most certainly adds to the fun.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Anyway, OLR, take care of yourselves, and I'll quite possibly see you soon, as soon as next year, perhaps, eyebrow waggle.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Sincerely, Martin.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Take care of yourself and each other.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Real quick, and, you know, this kind of goes back to something we were talking about way earlier in the show.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Kunamata, that was on your release dates for coming out in the Asia regions, well, it's already been out in the Asia regions, but this is the English slash Chinese version.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
So, you could import this and play it in English.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Thought about it, it's only $49.90.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
It's not bad.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Can't run over the animals, though, that is a downside.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Dope.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000
We have more.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
All right, let's hear more.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
One of them tricked me!

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
It said love, love, love, love, love, and I thought it was about me, but it was spam.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Bastards.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I hate those spammers.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
You know he should have F-ed?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
The one who stole your magnet off your car.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Oh, I forgot about that.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I had a rainbow all of his divine magnet on my car, and somebody stole it.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Oh, it's on the fridge right now.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Pissed me off.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Ugh.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Pissed me off.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
That's so messed up.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Moving forward.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Damn thieves!

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Bastards!

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I can't make a fist.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
This sucks.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Okay, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act of theft.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000
A few weeks ago, I got Tales of Vesperia, and it's a pretty good game.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I recommend it.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Can I point out where we live?

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
There's lots of friendly neighborhood Mexicans.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Actually, lots and lots.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Just wanted to say.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
But he's an actual, in Mexico, Mexican.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Alright, fair enough.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
And that makes him special.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
But that's not what I want to talk about.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I want to comment about how I got it for a cheaper price than it would have cost in the

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
US, and what's curious about this is that I got it for full price.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Most games when sold in Mexico are ridiculously overpriced because of stupid import handling

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
taxes, and to top it all off, most stores charge you even more and make games pretty

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
much an expensive thing to invest in.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Except for those, like me, who live next to the US and can cross the border to buy stuff.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
With the most recent global economy crisis, the Mexican peso has lost its gain to the

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
US dollar.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
But for gaming, it has meant a good thing rather than bad.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000
When I bought Tales of Vesperia, I bought it for 7.55 pesos, which is the MSRP price

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
for it down here.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Now, a dollar is worth 13.50 pesos, approximately.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.000
So doing the math, I sold the game and cost the equivalent of $55 US total.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
That's a savings of $5 US without added sales tax.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I marveled myself on how this crisis has caused at least one good thing.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Another example is Gears of War 2, which is a newer game.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000
In the US, it costs $60, while in Mexico, it costs around 650 pesos.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Again, doing the math, the game's cost in Mexico is the equivalent of $47, approximately,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
$13 in savings.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
And there are other games that would cost less here than crossing the border.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Unfortunately, there are other games that still do cost more here than in the US, but

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
like I said, it's because of store making up prices rather than giving us the real retail

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000
price.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Especially on Playstation and Nintendo games, since they don't have a real representation

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
in Mexico or Latin America, unlike Microsoft, which does have it.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Oh well, that's all for now.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Kinda happy news in all this crisis stuff.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Sorry to Jamie who reads this email if there are any grammatical or spelling errors in

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
it.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
You know what?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:57.000
You have better grammar and spelling than most people in America do.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Yeah, when you consider that English is not this gentleman's first language, from what

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I understand.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I believe he said before Spanish is the native language.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
You're my freaking hero today.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
There you go.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
A very rare commendation from dark soccer.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
You don't get that very often in the mailbag statement.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Look at you.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Wear that badge with honor, my friend.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:20.000
We also got an email forwarded to us.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
There's a very long email in there.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
It is a very long email.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Email a statement for next week.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
But it was sent by one of our All Games listeners through All Games Radio.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And I'll tell you what, because of the length of this and because it is actually a well

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
thought out question, I'm going to post it on the forum.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Well, they wanted us to talk about it on the show.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
There was some question in there.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Look for a really short paragraph towards the bottom.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I'm trying to remember what it was about.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
What might be your thoughts regarding you as the consumer using LittleBigPlanet as an

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
advertising self-promoting marketing tool?

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Okay, let me give you the gist of the email because it is kind of long for air, but I

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
did read it off air.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Basically, the emailer was wondering, he was listening to some other shows in All Games

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
and this kind of crossed his mind and wanted to hear our take on it because I guess he's

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
been pulling some different shows.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
I'm glad I didn't put it on the forum then.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
No, it's a good question.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:21.000
LittleBigPlanet has this potential to be like a new medium for all this marketing.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.000
What's the potential for it or where do you see people using it?

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.000
What do you think people could be using LittleBigPlanet for with all the marketing?

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000
To me, I kind of think, well, in a way, it's a little big planet I kind of compare to a

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
new website.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Does that make sense?

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Like a YouTube or iTunes or something.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I guess iTunes is really a website, but you know what I mean?

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.000
If there is a way to sell your product on it, there will be people that want to do that.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
It is the quote unquote American way after all, even though we have a worldwide audience.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
You know what I mean?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Capitalism is big all over the world.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Look at a site like YouTube.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
You have tons of people.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
At first, what was YouTube?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
YouTube was a way to pirate TVs and commercials.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000
When they had to legitimize themselves, it became this really interesting way to kind

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
of sell music and all this other stuff.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
iTunes.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Podcasting.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:18.000
When we signed up to do podcasting, it was people like us in their garages, in their

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
basements with microphones talking about shit they liked.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Now it's hugely commercialized, and we're having a hard time staying afloat amongst

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
all these.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I mean, we'll be here doing our thing for a long, long time, but we have a hard time

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.000
getting recognized because you have all these commercial people out trying to tie it into

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000
their website, their TV shows, their TV networks that have very little to do with gaming, but

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
they have video game podcasts anyways, and so on.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Is that the truth?

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.000
It's very interesting that where there's a way, people will kind of sell it, and it's

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
interesting that this email comes in.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Probably before, you have LittleBigPlanet talking about now that there's going to be

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
the Luminous thing, and I think there was a big misconception this week that there was

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
actually going to be a Luminous game inside LittleBigPlanet.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
That's not quite the case.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
It's that there's a LittleBigPlanet skin coming to Luminous.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Come to think of it, it really doesn't have anything to do with the whole thing you're

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000
talking about at all, except for the fact that where there is a way to tie it in to

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:25.000
market something in a video game, it can be done, and I bet you for sure there's going

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000
to be people that go out there and try to sell their website, their band.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
True story.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I was playing Warcraft the other night, and there was a shout in one of the villages.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I'm not even kidding.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000
If you live in, I think it was Boston, if you live in Boston, come check out this show

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
on Saturday night if you like this metal band.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I'm like, dude, how many people in this world of Warcraft might live in Boston?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Boston's a pretty big place.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I know it's a big place, but World of Warcraft is a really fucking big place.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
It's like 100 Bostons.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Do you remember in Animal Crossing when we could do the message in a bottle thing, and

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
we could send them out to random people?

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Yes.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:19.000
And I put in our radio station there and was sending out bottles like freaking mad.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
That's pretty much us doing the same thing.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And something that's also not in the Wii version anymore.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Thank you very much, Nintendo.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Very true, very true.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I didn't even think about that, but you're right.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
People have been using video games to promote their shit for a long time.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
But we could actually have all of our villagers say orangestonesradio.com, and then when they

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
move to other people's villages, they'll spread.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Okay, so the question was about LittleBigPlanet, though.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
But LittleBigPlanet makes it easy.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I'm surprised there is no OLR level on LittleBigPlanet yet.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
There probably ought to be.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I should probably get to work on that.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
We should have a contest.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:58.000
But it's also against the terms of service on LittleBigPlanet to promote websites using

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
levels in the game.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Oh, jeez.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Yeah, seriously.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
What if you do it discreetly?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Because, look, Bobby has a level from the beta, and he does it discreetly.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
He does it, he promotes it without...

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
And, granted, I don't think he put a lot of effort into level.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I think it was his way of exploring the game and being able to give the game a good review.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I don't think he ever kind of intended it to be the one and only thing he ever does.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000
But he invested a fair amount of time into it, but he kind of did a real easy-ish type

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000
of level that kind of slyly worked in a plug for his show.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
I think as long as you're not crazy about it, I bet they wouldn't have it.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000
They were actually promoting a LittleBigPlanet fan community on there, and it got pulled.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Why is that so weird?

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Yeah, it is stupid.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
They're getting a little stupid with that stuff.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
What are you laughing at over there?

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000
A picture that I got sent for the cover of Wolverine and Power Pack, number three.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Well, look, to go back to the email, definitely where there's a way to do it, people are going

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
to do it.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000
It's just a matter of time, but it's kind of interesting to see the moderation and how

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
that's going to play into it, because it was very hard to moderate Animal Crossing.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I mean, look at the N-word snuck through on one of those cartridges.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Anyhow, I guess that's it for our show then.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Was that the last email too?

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
It was indeed.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
All right.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Last email tonight, and if you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
We're done.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
We're ready to get out of here.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
We've got the final thoughts tonight.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Oh.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Yeah.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Never mind, because it comes after.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Okay.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I'm looking at this actual P90 tactical load-bearing vest, which is kind of neat, because I would

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.000
work with my airsoft gun, even though it's meant for actual real guns.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
All right.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Deadpool's fucking funny.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
My final thought is I'm fucking funny.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Duncan.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Shut up.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Beckers, thanks for joining us tonight.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I know you didn't get to talk a whole lot, but I'm glad you and Jamie got to sit there

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
in the corner and giggle like girls.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
It was fun.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
All right.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Do you have any final words for our listeners tonight?

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
It's freaking cold here.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
It is cold here.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I'm sorry.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
All right.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
You should see what it's like in the summertime, though.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Trust me, this is better than the alternative.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000
But we need to have Becky on when we have stupid parent stories.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Oh, boy.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Because we definitely need to hear from someone.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000
What?

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
We didn't even mention that story.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Uh-oh.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
What?

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Hold on.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Hold on.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
This is good.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
This is good.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
It was another game that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Or another crime that Grand Theft Auto was getting blamed for, and it had nothing to

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
do with Grand Theft Auto at all.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.000
It had to do with children torturing animals.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Yes, that's right.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Apparently, the newest crime that Grand Theft Auto can get blamed for is hanging kittens

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
with game controller cords after playing Grand Theft Auto.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Apparently, a pair of unsupervised boys, six and seven years old, stoned a kitten and then

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
strung it up following a Grand Theft Auto session.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
They reportedly used the controller cable in lieu of a rope.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
And you're not talking about blowing the bong smoke in the kitty's face.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
No, no.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Oh, god, that's terrible.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
No.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Apparently, this happened in late October in Mesa, Arizona, and it says the investigation

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000
began when deputies went to the neighborhood of one of the two boys and found the kitten

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
hanging by its neck from a backyard tree.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
The boys had apparently used the wire for the video game controller they were playing

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Grand Theft Auto to hoist up the kitten.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
The animal's head had been injured by blows from rocks.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
You know, I'm thinking this goes a little bit beyond video games.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:00.000
I'm thinking these kids are just really, really, really, really, really fucked up.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Hold on.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:09.000
But the county sheriff actually said, so one question, or what was it?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Who is this guy?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Arpeo.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I'm not sure if it's the boys' parents or something.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000
It says, this game allows players to kill cops and rape women.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:25.000
It's a little wonder why they perpetrated such violence against the little animal.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
YYR in our chat, it says the parents are to blame.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.000
They should have bought wireless controllers.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
It doesn't matter.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
They would have stoned it to death anyways.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Becker's just dying to say something.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Institutionalize your children.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
They're going to grow up to be serial killers.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
That has nothing to do with the video games.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
This is coming from a mom.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Parents, this has nothing to do with video games.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
This has everything to do with you.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Your genes did this.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Stop passing them on.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Your hell spawn, Damien Light, did this.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I agree with Becky, padded room.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Or just give them a hammer and leave them in a room by themselves.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Now can we end the show?

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Can we end the show now?

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000
No.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Thank you for ending the show on Dead Kittens, you ass.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Hey, I gotta go home and hug my kitty.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Okay, okay, okay.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I have one thing that will make it all better.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Cookies.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Yay, cookies.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
And on that note, we're going to go eat some cookies and end the show.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Good night.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Oh, and by the way, if you enjoy Orange on Trio,

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
please tell two people you know about the program and help us spread the word,

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
because as I mentioned earlier, it's really hard to stay afloat

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
amongst all the commercialized and corporate shows out there.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Word of mouth, it rocks.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
And you rock when you leave us happy reviews.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000
And join us for live shows on all games radio Sunday nights at 6 o'clock.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Send us an email sometime, because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
We'll see you next week.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
