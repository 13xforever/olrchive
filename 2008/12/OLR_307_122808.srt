Merry Christmas

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's too late for that

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's a preemptive one for 2009

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's still Kwanzaa

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's true

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Merry Kwanzaa

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000

Joining us as always, say hello to the one and only

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sad, Rob

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why are you sad?

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's the last show of the year

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I know, it's the last show ever

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And my nap got disturbed

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
How did your nap get disturbed?

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was napping and suddenly it was showtime

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thanks

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hit the ground running tonight

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The show before us, Bobby, you know we love Bobby

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He was running a little long tonight

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because he had a bunch of guests on

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They were doing 2008 reviews

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We were just kind of chilling

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And it kept going and going

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So we were like, let's take a cat nap

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But then our chat room was getting restless

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
As they might say overseas

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Rude

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A little bit rude

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But it's all good

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's handy

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So anyhow

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We're going to get the show started

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Talk about the latest in gaming this week

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And some of the highlights of 2008

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And gaming, we have listless tonight

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What about Loki?

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ah, fuck Loki

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, I'm just kidding

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Everybody say hello to Techmaster Loki

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't want to talk to you anyways

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sure he'd make his presence known at some point anyway

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I haven't gone into the gaming weeks yet

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But he still learned hello

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And if you haven't gone into the gaming weeks

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And still forgot Loki

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then you could yell at me

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Rob, don't you know that the first rule of parenting

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is maintain a schedule in order

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Am I your daddy?

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh baby

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Also say hello to the one and only

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Arcadian42 is joining us tonight

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Straight from the ultra-sensitive mics

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes, the ultra-sensitive mics

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Wanted to come and bother you for a show

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, please do

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You know, it was funny

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I had a bunch of people sending me private messages

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Before the show began tonight

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Do you have anyone coming? Do you have anyone coming tonight?

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And I was like, no

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm like, aren't the three of us good enough?

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, I didn't know you were coming

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And then you showed up and I'm like, oh good

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This will appease those people that were thinking

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We'd have some big, festive, year-end special

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
When in reality, most people that usually come on the show

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are out of town

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And of course, prepare to be disappointed

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When I don't say too much

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I haven't played any of the most, almost none of the games this year

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You know what, you'll just have to make your presence known tonight

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And when in doubt, just do what

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Rice Princess does and just fart in the mic

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, there you go

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We've decided, though, what your special power is

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The ability to show up at any party

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And still be there

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Playing pinball

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Just sit in a corner and you

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't notice me until

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No, it's like

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And we have no problem with this

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We just think it's funny

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Dan and I were talking about last time you were at one of our parties

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And we were just wandering around the house

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And people were starting to head off

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And nothing's going on in the garage

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
At least so we think

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We go into the garage and there he is

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Playing

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're turning the light out

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And you hear this voice

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was about to

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And all of a sudden

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I hear sound effects

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
From what machines do we have in there right now

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Indiana Jones

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No, we were fixing that one

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But I was just hearing sound effects

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I was like, what the crap? Oh, hi

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I have nowhere to go

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, we thought it was funny

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So that's your mutant power

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And if you hear crackles tonight

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
In the sound, it's not your guys' iPods

128
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Or speakers or what have you

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
One of our mics is strange tonight

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And Bradley

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is the most you've ever talked

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Like ever

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is a special day

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
God bless us, everyone

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm just saying

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, Tiny Rob

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Alright, let's go to

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hey, it's not the side, this is how you use it

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's get into your gaming week

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It was semi-eventful

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I played stuff

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I started Ragnarok Online DS

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And I was like

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ooh, Ragnarok

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Talking and talking and talking and talking

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And talking and talking and talking

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Wow, I read like a Japanese five-year-old

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Talking and talking and talking and talking

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And talking

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Finally, action!

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We're gonna fall off a cliff

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Shit, we landed on this guy

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's talk to him

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, it's a novice at these graves

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Which I'm guessing are his parents or some shit

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But he goes and hears the thump

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And it's this girl from

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Who's one of the shaman class that was made for the game

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And so he's like talking to her

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She's all up in his face

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Bump, bumping him back and everything

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He's like, what are you doing hitting him with your boobs?

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So it was like

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Talk to me!

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I forgot his name

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But I was like, text in blue

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can read it

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And it was named one of the towns

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was like, okay, good

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
All the towns are gonna be written in katakana

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And I can read that shit

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And it was

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It actually, when it goes through big dialogue scenes

175
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It has you saved periodically

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So I've saved

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And I've done my stats too

178
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So I at least

179
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Remember that all my stats are in the same place

180
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Because I recognize the kanji for strength

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And so I was like, well, strength is always the first one

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So maybe the next one is agility

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And the next one is intelligence

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And blah blah blah blah

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, but besides the talking, does it play like the online one?

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I haven't gotten that far

187
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm just talking right now

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So I was like, well, I should go to bed

189
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I did

190
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And I tried to go back and play some more Order of Ecclesia and I still suck

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, because I just need one more level worth of life bar and I'll be okay

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because I was like, right toward the end of the forest

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Stupid freaking forest!

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's like worse than Simon's Quest

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What a horrible night for a curse

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And so

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Anyway, so anyway

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I also

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I went with my friend Becky

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And we got her husband an Xbox

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, she did that technically

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She got the family their Christmas present of an Xbox 360

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And she gave him

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A big fat gift certificate to GameStop

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And I was like

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, if you were gonna actually pick out games for him

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You should get him

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Fallout 3

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And Fable 2

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And the Orange Box

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
All of them

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Awesome

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hell yeah

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So anyway, so I actually got to see some of

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Fallout 3 and I thought it was pretty cool

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I didn't play any because those games make me freaking

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Nauseated as hell

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Did you get to hit the button that makes the baby talk?

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I haven't really played Fallout 3 yet

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But I was listening to Bobby talk about it on the last show

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When they were talking about the

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't remember what it was, but he was talking about slamming on the button

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That makes the baby talk and I'm like, wow, that sounds kind of awesome

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That could be the best game ever

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I played some Animal Crossing

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So that I could harass Jingle

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Who I think is on crack

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh shit, I forgot about Holidays and Animal Crossing

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Because he has the starry eyes

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I think that it really means that Jingle is on crack

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So he won't sleep at all that night

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So it's like, here's your presents

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Kids

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And, and, and, and

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I downloaded something on my phone

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What's that?

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, two things. First of all was the

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
8,000 cocktail drink mixing guide

239
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
For free

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hey, we're having our

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
New Year's party at Julie's house

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I need to be drunk

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Because it's Julie's house

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sorry

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No offense to Julie if you listen

246
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Intoxicated enough to play

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
To actually sing karaoke

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We will have a special guest

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Who will be here for this party

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Namely, Sauce

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, is she coming to town?

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, she's actually going to teleport in

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And show up just for five seconds

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That night and leave

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes, she's coming

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Alright, I think I'll see you at Gaming Week

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Before I smack you

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I did play other stuff, I played Rhino Rock Online

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The real thing

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The real one for free

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And someone gave me a mistress card

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
For Christmas

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I was like, ooh, a mistress card

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Is that like a business card?

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Like if you ever need a mistress to be called?

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A stupid bee

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That I hate

268
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She's one of the MVP things

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And then you get a card

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That makes you not have to use gems

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
To cast stuff

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Which is helpful and useful

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Only I forgot to put it in something

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So I got that

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And

276
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I played with the City of Heroes character creator

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
A lot, the Korean one

278
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I hear it's the best part of the game

279
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's why I have the Korean character creators

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I haven't played the whole game yet

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm thinking about playing it

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because I was really thinking about it

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I was like, dude, why would I even remotely

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Want to play World of Warcraft again?

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Because I was just looking at

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Different stuff going on

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was like, dude, I don't want to play that anymore

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So I'm kind of waffling again

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So that's really it

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
For my Gaming Week

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let me read some chat comments

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You can always join our chat room

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Chat.orangelaundry.com

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
GS68 comments on

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Both you and I have said

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Things about the level of difficulty in the

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And I don't know if it's just because we suck at games

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Now that we've gotten older

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Or the game really is kind of a step harder

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But GS68's thoughts is

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
At least Ecclesia is think on your feet hard

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Not stupid hard like Circle of the Moon

304
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, well, this is what I've noticed

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I've actually got pretty good

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Reaction time through the

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Through the forest

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I sped through the first level

309
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I really just sped through it

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And I think that

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I would probably

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Do better with about another level's worth of life

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And then I can get through it

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because it's like

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This one place that I always end up

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Getting smacked around at

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Since you didn't get your time gaining experience points

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So

319
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So I'm going to go back and

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And we have an offer from Xenocore in chat

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Who's on the justice server in City of Heroes

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, thank you kindly, sir

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It was okay

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I played more

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Dissidef

327
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Or Dissidia

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Of the new Final Fantasy

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't even know who you want to call the fighting game

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
To me, it's very similar to

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Crisis Core a bit

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because Crisis Core, if you've ever played it

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Is pretty much all battles

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I mean, there's a little bit of

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Kind of dialogue

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And little plain stuff

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In between, but you have kind of

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Your main base that you

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Do all your purchasing of items and stuff like that

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But Dissidia is all

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Fighting

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And you can purchase items actually

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Through your status screens

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Stuff like that

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Which I finally figured out how to do

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Because I was like, well what the hell am I getting Gil for?

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't use this for anything

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I'm like, oh, there's a store

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, there's better weapons

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Why I'm not doing any damage to these people

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's been okay

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's kind of a lot of grinding

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Because right now I'm just leveling up Cloud

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know, it's still fun

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I wish I could understand some of the story that's going along

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But to be honest, it doesn't

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Really seem like I'm missing a whole lot

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So, eh

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And then

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I went ahead and

363
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Fired up my Playstation 3

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I tried out Home

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's okay, I guess

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I was kind of bored with it

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I tried making a character look like myself

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And then that didn't work, so the next best thing

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Was I made a creepy Santa Claus

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And I had to

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You know, first I was just trying to find

373
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Clothes that looked like the Santa Claus clothes

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And then I realized that they actually sold the Santa Claus

375
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Clothes, so I had to buy those

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And so now

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Wait, wait, wait, stop

378
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hold on, you bought something

379
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
In Home? Yeah

380
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Get off the show

381
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I am laughing you off

382
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Of this program

383
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You spent money on that

384
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's it

385
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's all I spent money on

386
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But yeah, I didn't even end up buying the club

387
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Remember how I talked about how I wanted to buy the OLR club

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, turns out I could go in and buy it

389
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And after I was reading more about it, I'm like, this sounds stupid

390
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There's no point for it yet

391
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But, you know

392
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Basically I bought stuff on there

393
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Just to see how easy it was

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And it actually is pretty easy

395
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The items are pretty cheap

396
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
At least the clothes were only like 50 cents each

397
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And the thing about it is

398
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I had knocked the PlayStation Network before

399
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Because I hated the way you put money on your account

400
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And you have to spend so much

401
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Actually, I found out

402
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If you have

403
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If you are buying items that are under

404
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
$5

405
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Then yes, you can only put in

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The minimum of $5 on your account

407
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If you're purchasing stuff over $5

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
In total

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What will happen is

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Say if you have less than $5 in credit left

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It will only charge you

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You can have the option just to

413
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Import the exact amount into your account

414
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Which is something I wish Microsoft

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Would totally do with Xbox Live

416
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Because that would be awesome

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
None of this

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
20 points just sitting there for no reason

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You can actually just do the exact amount

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Which is sweet

421
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So yeah, I played around with home

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
For a little bit

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And it was a complete waste of time

424
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't get

425
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What the purpose of all this is

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But at least you look like Santa Claus

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So hooray for that

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes, at least I look like Santa Claus

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Big deal

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm going to still wear the Santa Claus costume forever

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm not buying any more clothes

432
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's it, I'm Santa Claus forever now

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Even in June

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's fun

435
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So yeah, it was quite boring

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And the loading is annoying

437
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I gotta say

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Some comments from chat because they're too good

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hanukkah Harry in chat says

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What the fuck Loki, you might as well buy Eye of Judgment

441
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
No, I'm not buying Eye of Judgment

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Trishlicious in chat says

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I wish I had a Playstation 3 then I could be exploring home now

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Honestly, Trish

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I used to feel that same way

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Like 6 months ago

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You're not missing much, honestly

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think home is going to be a lot better in a year

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But that'll be a year

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I do have to give them credit though

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The video integration in it

452
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like the actual little video screens and stuff

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's actually pretty cool

454
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And it's pretty seamless

455
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But at the same time it's kind of annoying

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And it's also annoying how much

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Stuff is being censored in there

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Like everything is being censored

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And it's really annoying

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Ok, so enough with home

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The other thing I downloaded on the Playstation Network this week

462
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Was the new Metal Gear Solid pack

463
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
For LittleBigPlanet

464
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And holy crap does that change the game

465
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It really, first of all

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The pack itself contains like

467
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
5 levels and I think a challenge level

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And they're great levels

469
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I mean it's the same kind of quality

470
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
As the in-game story levels

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They're awesome

472
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I like it though because the whole premise of the levels

473
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Is that you're basically

474
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Going to try to stop

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Liquid's

476
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Device for creating trophy levels

477
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a machine that creates trophy levels

478
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Genius, pure genius

479
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I love the way that Media Molecule

480
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Played on some of the current controversies

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The only thing that would have been even better

482
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Was a joke about moderation

483
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Somehow

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But I love that they actually made fun of the whole trophy whoring levels

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That was great

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But the actual

487
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Like the new weapon, the paininator in it

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Awesome, it really

489
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's going to open it up to a whole bunch of new

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Types of levels

491
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Which is great

492
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And from what I actually watched the podcast they did on

493
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Kotaku

494
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
They were talking about what their plans are

495
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
For LittleBigPlanet and they were asked about LittleBigPlanet 2

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And they said

497
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
They have no plans on making LittleBigPlanet 2

498
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
As long as they can keep adding to LittleBigPlanet 1

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They're going to keep doing that

500
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's all they're working on

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Unless they hit a roadblock

502
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Unless they really want to add

503
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That they can't do in LittleBigPlanet

504
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,560
But for right now, they're just going to keep doing download packs because they're selling

505
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,060
really well.

506
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,220
So that's kind of cool.

507
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,280
Now just to clarify though, you don't have to buy this Metal Gear Solid add-on to get

508
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,500
to use the Paintinator because it'll show up in other people's levels, right?

509
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Yes, that's right.

510
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
That's kind of neat.

511
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,820
Yeah, but if you want to add it to your own levels, then you have to buy it.

512
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,140
Honestly, you should buy it anyways because it's awesome.

513
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,660
I actually bought the Metal Gear Solid pack to the little costumes because I had to dress

514
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,200
up like, I think, Raiden in there or something.

515
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
It's cool now.

516
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,420
So I'm doing that instead of my weird ninja cape guy.

517
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,340
But yeah, I was playing some more of the levels on there.

518
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,100
They're really cool.

519
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
The Paintinator's fun.

520
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,300
And just someone actually made a level that was like a tank that had three different weapons

521
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,380
and stuff on there and that was kind of neat.

522
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,860
And just some of the stuff that they do in the Metal Gear Solid levels are just amazing.

523
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,340
They actually have one level that you have to sneak and avoid these spotlights because

524
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,700
if not, then you die because all these explosions come.

525
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,700
And then just, you know, the last boss in the game, it's awesome.

526
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,580
It really is an awesome set of levels and I really hope they keep releasing stuff like

527
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,100
this because they're really cool.

528
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,700
And then, of course, you know, the usual stuff, you know, more Grand Theft Auto IV, both on

529
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:39,140
PC and on the 360 and yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.

530
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,140
Alright.

531
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,060
Arkadian42, Bradley Surd, the chatty one tonight.

532
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,540
I saw you haul a DS in here and you were kind of playing DS while we had a little bit of

533
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,460
downtime a little bit ago.

534
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,020
What kind of games have you been playing this week?

535
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,900
Alright, most of this week I was not playing anything because I was at home on the other

536
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,380
coast doing Christmas stuff.

537
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,220
But what I've been playing recently is My Japanese Coach.

538
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
Wait, wait.

539
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,220
Where is home?

540
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Because we might have some listeners there that want to go, whoo!

541
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,220
Greenville, South Carolina.

542
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
Whoo!

543
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Alright.

544
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,220
Long way away.

545
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,220
Yes.

546
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,940
In front of the airport yesterday because my first flight was overweight so it drove

547
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,220
five of us down to Atlanta for the second flight.

548
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
Oh wow.

549
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
Yeah, it was a fun time.

550
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Interesting.

551
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,260
Yeah, they were carrying extra fuel because there was like fog or something in Atlanta

552
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,900
so just in case it couldn't land at the time and had to fly around for half an hour or

553
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
something.

554
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,580
So you got lots of DS time in during all this travel debacle.

555
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,940
Well, actually I was listening in because there was a British couple who lived in the

556
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,260
area and they were going back to England for a week for someone's funeral or something.

557
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,540
It was kind of fun to listen to them.

558
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,100
But anyway, the one I was playing...

559
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,420
Sorry, I told me to laugh but I'm just trying to picture what must have been so fascinating

560
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,580
about this conversation.

561
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,580
Never mind.

562
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,580
Another show.

563
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
My Japanese coach.

564
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,580
Okay.

565
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,260
Well, I'm basically reviewing what I've learned before for the most part and learning a little

566
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,260
bit enough to get through that.

567
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,340
And it's actually pretty good for learning new stuff and I think there's maybe the only

568
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,820
limitation if you're like a newer user would be or a newer person learning Japanese would

569
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:24,260
be that it kind of glosses a little bit over the learning sentences and so on, but it's

570
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,420
good on repetition of words and so on.

571
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:33,300
Which is if you're just reviewing the first 30 or 40 lessons, it's a little bit tedious

572
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,580
because it takes a while because you have to repeat games and stuff to get to the next

573
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
lesson.

574
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,780
Do you actually have to talk into it?

575
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,040
No, you don't have to talk.

576
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,020
There is a thing you can actually compare.

577
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,740
You can speak into the mic and then it'll repeat it back and you can kind of compare

578
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,080
it to actually the actual Japanese speaker that's in the game so that you can learn that

579
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
stuff.

580
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
That sounds neat.

581
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,940
Do you think somebody like me who doesn't know a lick of Japanese yet tries to pronounce

582
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,820
the Japanese release dates here on Orange Launch Radio and gets teased for it every

583
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,740
other week, do you think I might have some benefit to play this game?

584
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,380
Yeah, it would be pretty good.

585
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
I might have to check it out.

586
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,580
Yeah, and then you can learn the hiragana and katakana and of course it takes a long

587
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,780
time because it's not until less than 40 or something.

588
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,020
Although Jamie did admit a few weeks ago, I've gotten better in the years I've been

589
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
doing it.

590
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
You have gotten quite a bit better.

591
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,700
I've gotten better, so when in doubt, crash and burn your way through it.

592
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Arigato.

593
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,820
Yeah, because basically when I've been listening to the podcast, trying to catch up, I'm still

594
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,820
like 30 behind.

595
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,820
I'm actually thinking about getting that, though.

596
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,740
Oh man, come on, you can say that better.

597
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
With the Japanese coach?

598
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
Yeah.

599
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
Yeah?

600
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,820
Because I have a couple of friends that live in Japan that I want to visit, but I also

601
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,660
have people I know in England that I want to visit, so I have to think.

602
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,380
See if I really wanted to learn Japanese, what I would do is get Jamie a device where

603
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,340
every time I mispronounce a word, she shocks me, but the problem is that she would use

604
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,780
that device for things other than its intended purpose, so I don't allow her to have this

605
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
device.

606
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,980
Hanukkah Harry said I was a scroll.

607
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,740
I'm not a scroll.

608
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,100
That probably finishes gaming week.

609
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:09,500
Okay, I'll go a little bit farther than this week because other than this, since it's been

610
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,020
a while since I've been here, the other things I've been playing is Castlevania Lament of

611
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,300
Innocence, which, even though I heard people saying it was bad or something, it's actually

612
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,700
a pretty good game.

613
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,360
Other than the camera issues, which you can't see half the time because it's looking in

614
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,660
the other direction from the actual degree of movement, it's actually pretty enjoyable

615
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:36,260
and the voice acting is really good, and the other thing was Zelda Phantom Hourglass, which

616
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,220
I've still got a ways to go, and that's a fun game.

617
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,100
Alright, reading some other comments in chatroom, Akuma JP says, commenting on my reading of

618
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,820
the Japanese release dates, Sky sometimes gets very good when he is in a good mood,

619
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,380
but no idea when he is not in the mood, so apparently if I'm in a good mood, I'll do

620
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,540
better at reading the release dates, so I'll try to smile before I read the dates tonight

621
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,340
so I'm in a good mood, although I don't think we have a lot this week.

622
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,740
Alright, my gaming week, real quickly, because pretty much everything I wanted to talk about

623
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,340
has already been talked about.

624
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,580
I have been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King, as you know, I'm addicted

625
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,860
to MMOs, but I would like to congratulate our guild for clearing Nax, that was pretty

626
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,220
awesome, which is one of the big raids at the end, we cleared 10-man Nax this week,

627
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:27,780
which is nice, and the other thing I've been playing is the Metal Gear Solid expansion

628
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,900
on LittleBigPlanet, which is amazing, and everybody should buy it, because not only

629
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,620
does it come with the whole gun and things you can put in your own levels, I don't even

630
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,180
design levels, but I just kind of wanted to see, my thought was, is that, hmm, probably

631
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,100
Media Molecule designed some levels to unlock this stuff in, because I heard that you actually

632
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,500
had to play these levels to unlock the stuff, so you're basically getting, you know what,

633
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,780
five or so new Media Molecule levels, and they are great!

634
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,920
And I realized I could go online and download a ton of other levels, but there's something

635
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,100
about having the official developer with official unlocks, being able to play those levels,

636
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,300
and they are fantastic.

637
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,900
Something Loki kind of neglected to mention is that not only can you run through them

638
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,620
once, but you can go back and you can play through these same levels again with new challenge

639
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,980
elements on them, you'll get stickers at the very end that you can go back and place at

640
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,300
the very beginning, and then suddenly the entire level becomes a race, which makes some

641
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,360
of those things like the stealth level and stuff become very interesting, because you're

642
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,100
trying to rush, but not too much.

643
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,520
I've actually gotten most of the trophies for the entire thing, in fact, I think I have

644
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,700
all the trophies except for the one beating the last boss under a certain time limit,

645
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,740
but I have all the other trophies, because I've gone through-

646
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,780
I don't think I've unlocked a single trophy yet, sadly.

647
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:40,240
Because I've gone through, I've aced all the levels, I've gotten every single bit of collectible

648
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,400
stuff in the game, or at least in those levels.

649
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,620
I'm missing like two stickers in one level that is bugging the hell out of me because

650
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,620
I can't figure out where they are.

651
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,100
I know what you're talking about, you're talking about the third level, and it took me-

652
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
Yes, it is!

653
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,100
How do you know?

654
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,800
Where are they?

655
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
You tell me now!

656
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,820
Alright, I'll tell you now.

657
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,340
You know that spot where you have to shoot the green thing so the platforms lower down?

658
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Yeah.

659
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,180
On the second one that lowers down, you walk through to the left, and there's a hallway

660
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
that you can walk through.

661
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
Oh, shut up.

662
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Really?

663
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Yeah, it took me forever to figure that out.

664
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,220
That is so crazy, I didn't even have to tell you what it is that's frustrating me, and

665
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,740
I know exactly what you're talking about, I'm like, nope, I haven't been there.

666
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,740
You're right, that's what I'm missing.

667
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,420
Yeah, because I had to read the comments for the actual level, and there was questions

668
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,020
about that in there, and that's where they said it was.

669
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,860
I knew, just playing the level, I'm like, there's something down there, I just don't

670
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
know how to get down there.

671
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,980
The network was down the day I was trying to play, so I couldn't do that.

672
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Interesting.

673
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,860
But I gotta say, honestly, if you have LittleBigPlanet, check out the expansion, you won't be disappointed.

674
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,300
Even if you don't build levels, I think the five or so levels that come with it are, it's

675
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
six bucks.

676
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
It's worth it.

677
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
It really is.

678
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,540
Okay, let's move on with tonight's show, and try to get into some gaming news.

679
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,560
But first, some housekeeping tonight.

680
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,540
First off, we want to make sure everybody had a really wonderful holiday, and just a

681
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,340
quick reminder, although we didn't take off any shows for the holiday, we will not be

682
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:04,580
here January 11th, I believe is the day, yeah, January 11th, we will not be here, so no yelling

683
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,820
at Bobby if he goes long.

684
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,820
January 11th.

685
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,300
He can go to midnight if he wants, I don't really care, so be nice.

686
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,460
But yeah, no, we're not going to be here January 11th at all.

687
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,660
And just out of curiosity, something else I want to ask during housekeeping tonight,

688
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,380
did you all get any gaming loot for Christmas?

689
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,160
I didn't really get anything, but did you guys get any gaming loot for Christmas?

690
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,540
I got two things from Dan.

691
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:31,380
Well, keep in mind, we bought each other new computers, so we easily spent a couple grand

692
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,140
on each, you know, together for our presents.

693
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,700
But he did get me the Animal Crossing Strategy Guide, so I know what all the Toto KK songs

694
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,460
are called now.

695
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:49,000
And he got me these Kingdom Hearts promo cards that they had at his store, and I kind of

696
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,180
wanted them, so he grabbed me some, and I got the Silent Hill Homecoming soundtrack,

697
00:26:54,180 --> 00:27:00,460
which a lucky person is going to be receiving a copy as well, but I won't say anything more

698
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,460
than that.

699
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,180
Ooh.

700
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,980
And candy.

701
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,340
And I got a coat.

702
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,780
I have a funny story about my coat.

703
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,820
You remember the coat I was wearing last week?

704
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,860
Yes, I do.

705
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,740
Well, Becky and I were going shopping.

706
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
Did someone knock on the...

707
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
No.

708
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
No.

709
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,220
We were going shopping, and we saw these coats at this one retailer, who I will not

710
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,100
mention, and we thought they were cute, so we went in, and it was like marked down from

711
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,820
$89 to $39, and they were probably going to get one half price.

712
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,220
So we just gifted each other coats, and they were really cool.

713
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,220
Nice.

714
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,220
And super cute, but I'm not wearing it today.

715
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
Um...

716
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,220
Surprisingly, the studio's not nearly as cold as it has been in previous weeks.

717
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Dude, it's not.

718
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,100
I was thinking I was going to freeze or some shit.

719
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
Yeah, it's been kind of nice.

720
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,940
I don't know what the difference is today, but I'm not going to complain.

721
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,540
And of course, I got a Ragnarok Online DS from Loki.

722
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,620
Aw, Loki.

723
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
You're the best.

724
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,620
Hey, no problem.

725
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,620
All right.

726
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,620
One other thing...

727
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,620
Oh.

728
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Oh, yeah?

729
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
I got Knights on Wii.

730
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,620
Oh, how's that?

731
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,620
Haven't opened it yet.

732
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,200
I didn't get any games or anything, but Rama did send me this shirt that says Companion

733
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,740
Cube is my co-pilot, so thank you very much to Rama, who sent me that shirt, which I think

734
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
is great.

735
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,740
It's very cute.

736
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,380
This is something you cannot have.

737
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,780
And I'm being very scummy because I wore it yesterday, too, and I'm doing that really

738
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,300
gross thing where I wore the same shirt two days in a row because I was lazy today.

739
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,300
I didn't really leave the house, so whatevs.

740
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Come on.

741
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
You've all been there, too.

742
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,560
Admit it.

743
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,300
I do want to work in a plug for Bobby because our listeners chased him off the air tonight,

744
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,740
so the least I can do is give him a plug for his new project, which is actually going to

745
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,740
be pretty awesome.

746
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,540
And if I was in Atlanta, I would go.

747
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,420
Sadly, I'm not.

748
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:51,380
Sadly I might be, and I would make it a point on Friday night to go check out fnglive.net.

749
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,940
It's a new program that starts January 9th.

750
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
That's the same weekend.

751
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,460
We're not going to be here, sadly, but it all starts January 9th, and they are taping

752
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,980
live at a computer arena in Atlanta, and there's going to be other people on, and they're going

753
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,780
to actually dissect game consoles and repair them live on air, and it's actually kind of

754
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,780
a multimedia thing.

755
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,780
It's not just a radio.

756
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,140
They're doing TV, too, so it sounds pretty exciting.

757
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,920
I just sent them my broken 360.

758
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
Good luck fixing that one.

759
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,460
Yeah, I think you have to take a number for that, because I think they already have lined

760
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,420
up what they're doing for the first two shows, but...

761
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,780
No, I don't want it back.

762
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
They can just...

763
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,780
They just have it?

764
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
Yeah.

765
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
I don't know.

766
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
Maybe they take it.

767
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,780
I don't know.

768
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,780
You'll have to talk to Bobby.

769
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,780
All right.

770
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
So check that out.

771
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,100
Again, fnglive.net, and they start January 9th right here on All Games Radio is where

772
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,300
you can hear the feed, so if you're not in Atlanta and you can't go check it out in person,

773
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,220
if you're in California, New York, Canada, wherever else you might be, you can check

774
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,940
it out on the internets.

775
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,940
Let's get into some gaming news.

776
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,380
Yes, we do have gaming news this week.

777
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,380
It's very odd.

778
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,900
We spend this week kind of reflecting on the year 2008, and we will do a little bit of

779
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,260
that later.

780
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,500
However, we need to talk about some news, because there's actually been some big news

781
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
this week.

782
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,580
Yeah, unfortunately it's not for our region, though, but Japan...

783
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
What happens in Japan?

784
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
Might happen here, right?

785
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,580
Still more.

786
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,340
Yeah, not so much, I don't think.

787
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,900
Basically, you know, Japan, they do a lot of things over there, especially with their

788
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:14,420
WiiWare service and Nintendo and that kind of stuff, that we will probably never see

789
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,900
over here.

790
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,940
For example, you know, they got a while back a...

791
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,740
I don't know if it was a couple WiiWare downloads, but they have a new, like, manga comics that

792
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,700
you can actually download on the service, which is kind of neat.

793
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,020
Plus, you know, they had their Nintendo channel for a while before we did.

794
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,700
Well, they're getting another channel, and it's not too surprising, since the other two

795
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,920
consoles also have one similar.

796
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,700
It's a new video streaming service that will be available.

797
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:59,660
Now, this is actually in conjunction with Densetsu, and it's basically not your typical,

798
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,300
you know, video download service, because they're not going to have movies, they're

799
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,920
not going to really have a lot of TV shows and stuff.

800
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
What they're going to have, though, is...

801
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Oh my God!

802
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,380
Is it what I've always been waiting for?

803
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,620
A porno on-demand service?

804
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,660
No, it's not a porno on-demand service.

805
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,040
It's actually going to be some...

806
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,140
They're going to have Nintendo videos on there, whatever that's supposed to be.

807
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,500
I don't know if that's, like, the old Nintendo cartoons, you know, like the old Donkey Kong

808
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,660
stuff, and, you know, stuff like that, maybe Captain N. You know, one can hope.

809
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,660
And they're going to also have...

810
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Oh God, no.

811
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
They're going to have...

812
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,260
Endless loops of Nintendo breakfast cereal commercials.

813
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,300
Basically, kind of think of, like, you know, family programming.

814
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,720
You know, stuff you'd see on Saturday mornings, that type of stuff.

815
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,380
That's what they're going to have on there.

816
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,500
Now, I don't know if it's actually going to have downloads as well.

817
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,340
It says some downloads will require payments, while others will be free.

818
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,700
There's that humming that one of the mics is causing, I don't know which one.

819
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Is it?

820
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Yeah, here.

821
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
It's a very...

822
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
That's a very naughty microphone.

823
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
Sorry, guys.

824
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
Anyway.

825
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,700
Live radio.

826
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,700
Hi.

827
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,980
Yeah, it's going to be coming early next year.

828
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,180
No prices have been announced yet, but interesting, though, that they're going to be bringing

829
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
this out.

830
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,740
Maybe this is something that's coming to the US.

831
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
I don't know how this...

832
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:25,220
To be honest, if you've ever used the web browser in this, you know, the bandwidth to

833
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,700
the Wii seems very, very slow, so can you imagine actually downloading content with

834
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,700
the Wii?

835
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,940
You know, like actual videos and stuff?

836
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,980
I think it would take forever.

837
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,820
We kind of need that upgrade that's supposed to get our SD cards, which wasn't that supposed

838
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,540
to be out before the end of the year?

839
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
Right.

840
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,980
That won't be coming out until...

841
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,260
You'll probably have to buy a game that'll unlock that or some shit.

842
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,620
Hitstun in chat says, Sky, porno on demand service equals the internet.

843
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,620
Ooh, touche.

844
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,620
But I can't really get that on my TV very easily.

845
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,220
I can use the internet channel or the PS3's internet thingy, I know, but they suck.

846
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,220
They're clunky.

847
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
But it works with...

848
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,500
If you're using YouTube on the Wii, it's not that good.

849
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,860
But you can do porno, too.

850
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,820
We did that one time, actually, at a bar.

851
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
It was clunky.

852
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,860
Yeah, that was actually last New Year's, wasn't it?

853
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,740
Or two years ago, maybe?

854
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Yeah, I don't know.

855
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,740
Yeah.

856
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
Anyway, sorry.

857
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,820
I don't watch porn!

858
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,820
That's sick!

859
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,980
Remember the donkey punch video that they had?

860
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
It was...

861
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
Shut up!

862
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,820
It was literally a guy dressed as a donkey.

863
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,820
Shut up, monkey!

864
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,820
That was hilarious.

865
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,100
We didn't do that.

866
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
Literal puns are funny.

867
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
No, we prayed, remember?

868
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,420
Cheese.

869
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,860
Oh, Lord, please let them do a sequel to this video.

870
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
Amen.

871
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,140
And pterodactyl porn.

872
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
Hey!

873
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,100
Food Delivery Channel is coming to Japan, as well.

874
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
That's right.

875
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,440
If you want to get food delivered to you, you can now do that through your Wii.

876
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,020
It's called the Damae Channel, the Food Delivery Channel.

877
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,380
8,500 different restaurants.

878
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,840
Apparently you are going to be able to browse it by genre.

879
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,340
Like pizza, bento boxes, sushi, curry, Chinese, whatever.

880
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,700
You apparently can go on here, and the restaurants will actually estimate what the delivery time

881
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,700
is.

882
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,460
You place the order on the Wii, it's faxed to the restaurant, and then it's kind of like

883
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,060
ordering it on the internet.

884
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,780
And I was kind of like, this has got to be bullshit.

885
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,700
But apparently, there are screenshots and everything.

886
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,860
And granted, this stuff can be photoshopped, but I don't know why someone would want to

887
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,520
waste that colossal amount of time on a stupid prank on Christmas.

888
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,580
So this looks to be the real deal.

889
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,580
I guess so.

890
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,580
I don't know.

891
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,580
But this looks to be pretty authentic.

892
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,780
And which is strange, because people predicted that this might happen a long time ago.

893
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,780
Well, I suppose people predicted everything.

894
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,580
But yeah, you look at this here, and there's even a screenshot here where somebody can

895
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,420
click on like Pizza Hut and order pizza.

896
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Interesting.

897
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,380
I don't know, if they did something like this in the US, do you think?

898
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,860
Man, Pizza Hut is talk about like a whore for like ordering stuff.

899
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,900
I mean, before they were in like EverQuest, you know, now they're in this business.

900
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,100
I would love to have a Pizza Hut here with the Japanese menu.

901
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:10,340
No, seriously, I was seeing one of the people I keep up with lived over there and posted

902
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,500
a picture of the order menu.

903
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,300
There's some very funky pizzas.

904
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,860
It's like something out of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or California Pizza Kitchen.

905
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,820
Or John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?

906
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,820
No.

907
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,820
OK.

908
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,220
Um, yeah, the thing is, though, I don't think a channel like that would work here because

909
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:32,540
we're not so, we're so spread out here in the US, whereas in Japan, there's a lot more

910
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,540
kind of, you know what I mean?

911
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,860
Like, I don't think, it might work in different cities, it might work in different, like,

912
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,740
it might, they might be able to do that for New York City for, well, I don't even know

913
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,100
if you could do it in Los Angeles and make it worth it.

914
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
I don't know.

915
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,620
But then you say, you talk about how Pizza Hut whores themselves in every game.

916
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,860
Well, that's just good business though, right?

917
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,820
They can get one extra order a day out of it, it's worth it, right?

918
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,740
But the thing in, I don't know, it's just like, I just don't see myself firing up the

919
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,940
Wii to order a pizza when, I don't know, I could use the phone like everybody else.

920
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,860
You can do internet ordering on a lot of these places' sites, too.

921
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
That's very true.

922
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,780
AcidicVampire in chat says, Pizza Hut equals Kaka Hut.

923
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,020
Actually, that's probably one of the pizzas you can get in Japan.

924
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,220
You know what, though?

925
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,100
And I'll tell you, their pasta is pretty good.

926
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,740
I actually thought about getting some of that, but the thing, the tray of pasta that they

927
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,420
give you is huge, and that would just look ridiculous if I'm eating a huge tray of pasta

928
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,420
here.

929
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,420
Goodness, we don't have the camera anymore.

930
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,180
Yeah, we don't have the camera.

931
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,980
You could bring an entire cake.

932
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
But still, though, I wouldn't.

933
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,260
You could bring an entire cake and eat it on here.

934
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,420
I don't like that much cake.

935
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,340
I'll just say, fatty's eating cake again.

936
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,060
I don't like cake.

937
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:49,100
Now I did want to make a meatball sub, though, and for some reason I saw on the Food Network

938
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,820
they had this thing where they were making it over to someone's kitchen, and that's what

939
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,340
they decided to make is a meatball sub.

940
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Like, damn, it looks good!

941
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,860
And all of a sudden, you know, I got a craving for a meatball sub.

942
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:03,660
This is the Pizza Hut menu in Japan as of June, and I want you to tell me if this sounds

943
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,060
tasty to you.

944
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:11,780
There's bacon mushroom, barbecue chicken, carbonara, which is bacon, egg spread, and

945
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,940
black pepper.

946
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,700
Without the egg spread, yes.

947
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,220
Cheese and cheese.

948
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,220
Sure.

949
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,860
Yes and yes.

950
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:25,140
Crab and shrimp mayo king, which is five shrimp, fake crab, corn, onion, broccoli, and mayonnaise.

951
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,060
I need the listeners to understand this.

952
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,340
I fucking hate mayonnaise.

953
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:33,120
Don't you ever give me anything with mayonnaise even remotely near it, because mayonnaise

954
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,580
will ruin anything for me.

955
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,580
I hate, hate, hate mayonnaise.

956
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:41,660
I hate warm mayonnaise, because warm mayonnaise, like mayonnaise on burgers, awful.

957
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,660
On sandwiches?

958
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,660
Okay.

959
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,660
Well, these are great.

960
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Okay, the deluxe is pepperoni, salami, bacon, and green peppers, blah, blah, blah.

961
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,660
Yes, yes and yes.

962
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,260
Gomodari pork, I'd actually eat that.

963
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,920
It's a burdock root mix, sesame sauce, pork, shredded seaweed, and sesame sauce.

964
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,980
The Idaho special is diced potatoes, bacon, onions, corn, parsley, black pepper, and mayonnaise.

965
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,380
That sounds awesome, except for the mayonnaise part.

966
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,380
There's one called the mayo queue, if you can guess what that is.

967
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,460
It's barbecue with mayonnaise.

968
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,780
Meat paradise, pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.

969
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
Loki?

970
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Does that sound good to you?

971
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
What?

972
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
I think we need to go to Japan.

973
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
When?

974
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,780
What was it?

975
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,780
It's called the meat paradise.

976
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
And?

977
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,780
It's pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.

978
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,700
That's just, that's just like, they have it already over here.

979
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,980
It's like the Monty's all meat marvel, and the...

980
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,760
Loki connoisseur of meat.

981
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,920
They used to have beef on their pizzas, but they don't do it anymore, because apparently

982
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,100
not that many people like beef, and it kind of went bad because no one ate it.

983
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,100
I want to have a pizza.

984
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,140
Here's a Sicilian style pizza with tuna mushrooms and meat sauce.

985
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,800
We could do a meat pizza, like a round table over here, because they have like multiple

986
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:00,060
varieties of like, you know, different pepperonis and different, you know, sausages, and they

987
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,060
have, I think they have chicken too, and ham, and God, we could just pile that shit up.

988
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,220
I remember someone that used to order like a quad sausage pizza.

989
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,980
That'd be four times the amount of sausage.

990
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,500
I kid you not, it was like a giant patty on top of the entire pizza.

991
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
It's like, what is wrong with you people?

992
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,940
Here, Rob, this one's for you.

993
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,000
Mochi mentai and potato.

994
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,660
Large shrimp diced potatoes, Korean mochi.

995
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,900
Corn, onion, mayonnaise, we'll ask for it without.

996
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,580
Shredded seaweed and fish roe sauce.

997
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,580
Mochi?

998
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:37,540
Or there's a seafood mix, which is large shrimp, squid, tuna, and mayonnaise, broccoli, and

999
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,540
onion.

1000
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,900
Who puts, I want to know who puts corn on a pizza.

1001
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,220
All the rest of it I could make, but corn is fucking disgusting.

1002
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
I've seen it.

1003
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,740
And then again, I'm also allergic to corn.

1004
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,940
Better yet, who puts mayonnaise on a pizza?

1005
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,380
I think they put mayonnaise on everything in Japan.

1006
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,380
So I can't go to Japan.

1007
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,540
Here we go, the last one on here.

1008
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,860
I'd die of starvation.

1009
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:03,500
Tartar chicken nanban, nanban chicken, red peppers, parsley, tartar sauce, and nanban

1010
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
sauce.

1011
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,060
As long as nanban doesn't mean like asshole juice, I'll be fine.

1012
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,740
It's basically Portuguese style chicken.

1013
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,100
Okay, that's fine.

1014
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
Like what is that?

1015
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,860
That could, when you're talking about a chicken, it could be anything.

1016
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,940
All right, anyhow.

1017
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,900
Some of this is just like, I would actually eat it though, because some of the stuff I'd

1018
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,660
order something similar, and really the cheese and cheese is like a margarita, the margarita

1019
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,660
pizza.

1020
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,660
Oh yeah.

1021
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,620
But I actually would order some of this stuff, because I have a CPK, but still.

1022
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,220
Okay, I ordered- How did this turn into Orange Lounge Fudio,

1023
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,940
going on like 15 minutes now?

1024
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,740
Because, this is why I want them to deliver Japanese style pizza.

1025
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,300
And poor Bobby got chased off the air for this?

1026
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,300
Yes he did.

1027
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,300
Nanban chicken?

1028
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:57,020
Well, if he was talking about pizza, we would have been fine with that.

1029
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,940
Note to Bobby, your show needs more meat.

1030
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
All right.

1031
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,340
You need meat paradise!

1032
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,940
All right, stop picking on Bobby.

1033
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,940
All right.

1034
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,620
Dark Sakura, what else is going on in gaming news?

1035
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,620
Well, there is this plumber named Mario who lives near a pizza place!

1036
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,540
No, I'm kidding.

1037
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:21,780
Basically it's something to be coming out for the virtual console in Japan is Super

1038
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,220
Smash Brothers.

1039
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,780
Like the Nintendo 64 one, dun dun dun.

1040
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,180
It will be there in January.

1041
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:39,380
So it's going to be out there for 1200 points, but there's no real say as to when we'll probably

1042
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,700
get it out here or so, but that means we probably will be getting it since we tend to get some

1043
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:52,100
of the stuff that, you know, if it was a release, Yawn and Hither, then it would definitely

1044
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,380
be duplicated over here, I would think.

1045
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,540
So there, Rob.

1046
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,540
That sounds nice.

1047
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,580
I guess I would download that.

1048
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,580
What?

1049
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
Meat paradise.

1050
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,540
Looking at some comments in chat, Giovedea in chat says, I have had a taco pizza with

1051
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
corn on it.

1052
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,540
It was really tasty.

1053
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,500
I was trying to, it's just pizza chat.

1054
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
I didn't see anything about video games.

1055
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,860
I think it should have scampi pizzas.

1056
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,380
Except, oh, AcidicVampire asks a good question.

1057
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,940
Will Super Smash Brothers 64 have online play?

1058
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,940
You wish.

1059
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
No.

1060
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
You wish.

1061
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,340
Did the Nintendo 64 version have online play?

1062
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,300
But in Pokemon Snap, they added the feature where you can save the snaps to your Wii message

1063
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,300
board.

1064
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,300
So?

1065
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,100
So it shows they can enhance the games if they really want to.

1066
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,100
So?

1067
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,380
And they don't want to.

1068
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,860
It makes you wonder, doesn't it make you wonder if maybe Pokemon Snap at one point had some

1069
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:52,780
type of feature to save those pictures in some type of more exportable format that they

1070
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,800
just, like the game maybe originally was going to let you, I don't know, save them to some

1071
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,980
type of computer or something, and now they turned it into this thing instead?

1072
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,860
Because that's the only game that has had anything special happen to it.

1073
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,700
When yet you would think a game like this, they would just try to add online play.

1074
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,660
But try for us.

1075
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,660
No.

1076
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:19,700
They don't want to try because this is the same company that is releasing GameCube games

1077
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,940
that you can now play on your Wii.

1078
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,940
Oh, wait a second!

1079
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,220
You can still play those GameCube games on your Wii already!

1080
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,460
It just doesn't have stupid motion controls.

1081
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,460
And guess what?

1082
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,460
They're cheaper.

1083
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,220
Chat dot orange launch radio dot com if you want to chat with us.

1084
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,220
Aha!

1085
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,420
That's exactly the type of thing I was looking for.

1086
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
Game Guru in chat.

1087
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,980
See, this is why I love having a live chat room.

1088
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,420
Because Pokemon Snap had a feature to download them to Blockbuster and print them out.

1089
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,940
So it's not, they didn't even really, really enhance it that much.

1090
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:52,700
They took a feature that everybody forgot about, including yours truly, and just changed

1091
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,700
it slightly.

1092
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,100
It's an altered enhancement.

1093
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,980
Wasn't that a Sega Genesis game?

1094
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,980
Alright, forget it.

1095
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,140
How about some release dates, Loki?

1096
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,140
Altered enhancement?

1097
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,940
Well, um, yeah.

1098
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,500
There's, uh, nothing coming out.

1099
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
At all.

1100
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Nothing?

1101
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Not a damn thing?

1102
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
Not a damn thing.

1103
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Alright.

1104
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,500
Wow.

1105
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,860
I mean, I had this, uh, not a good time of year for, um, you know, most companies are

1106
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,300
closed and, yeah, not a thing.

1107
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Not even, like, Imagine?

1108
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,980
No, uh, the Spore, the Spore comic book creator, I think, was the only thing, and that's not

1109
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,540
even technically a game, so.

1110
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,860
Well, I wish I could tell you it looked much different in Japan, but it actually does not

1111
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,340
look like we have a lot of releases this week either in Japan.

1112
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:49,700
Um, looking very quickly to see, even if there's anything on Wii, no, it's going to be a very

1113
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,820
slow month in Japan.

1114
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,020
There's very few games coming out even in the first couple weeks of January over in

1115
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,020
Japan.

1116
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:01,500
Um, no, the DS, geez, even the DS titles don't start rolling in until the 15th, but hey,

1117
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,080
you could pre-order The Happening, which comes out on January 9th on the Sony PSP, but otherwise

1118
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,020
there is absolutely nothing coming out in Japan this week.

1119
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,020
Well.

1120
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,540
How about the UK?

1121
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:19,820
I can't really say that there's a whole bunch coming out in the UK, because, um, first of

1122
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:28,500
all, my list isn't showing 2009, so that's, uh, actually kind of disturbing.

1123
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,340
We'll just assume nothing of notice coming out there as well.

1124
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,940
Some stuff.

1125
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,380
Yeah, really, not a lot.

1126
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,020
Well, so much for release dates.

1127
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,740
Wah wah, you lose.

1128
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,740
Rob.

1129
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,740
What?

1130
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,740
We've had a call for more pizza.

1131
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,740
More pizza?

1132
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,100
I can't, I can't even think about more pizza.

1133
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,100
I already ate.

1134
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,420
Didn't they have, like, a peanut butter and jelly pizza or something, that John's Incredible

1135
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,420
Crappy Pizza?

1136
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,620
Um, I don't think so.

1137
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,620
I don't, well, they might.

1138
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,620
I don't know.

1139
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,060
I just know, I remember the ones that are, like, different and crazy are the macaroni

1140
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,380
and cheese pizza and the, uh,

1141
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,220
Are very awful.

1142
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,420
That peanut butter one that had the actual peanuts on it, which I thought was strange.

1143
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,500
That was actually pretty good, but it was spicy.

1144
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Yeah, it was very spicy.

1145
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:13,260
So, I, I, I do have to, though, share a little bit of, um, what, um, is on menus in Japan

1146
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,260
for, um, McDonald's.

1147
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,660
Alright, why not, since we didn't have release dates?

1148
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:17,660
Let's go back to food.

1149
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,660
Filet of shrimp.

1150
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,660
Okay.

1151
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,660
Yeah.

1152
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:28,660
Um, then there's the Mega Mac, which, imagine a Big Mac with two more patties.

1153
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,300
Yum.

1154
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,300
And then, um, there's an Ebi, that's, that's the same one, that's the shrimp.

1155
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,260
And then the Thousand, the Shrimp Thousand Island Wrap.

1156
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,460
You know when I go to, uh, Hawaii in two weeks, you know what I have to get?

1157
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,460
Hmm?

1158
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,460
A McDonald's?

1159
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,460
What?

1160
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,460
Spamburger.

1161
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,460
Oh my God, aren't those good?

1162
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,620
I like Spam musubi.

1163
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,780
And the, uh, teriyaki pineapple thingy.

1164
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,780
They do, right?

1165
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:57,500
And, um, they also have McPork and, um, the teriyaki McBurger.

1166
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,260
So there's more food from around the world.

1167
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,300
We do have gaming news at some point, right?

1168
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,300
Yes, we do.

1169
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,380
I'm looking at Burger King.

1170
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,860
Um, yes.

1171
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:15,440
Like the merger of Spam and Shrimp and hamburgers, um, we have yet another game company merger

1172
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,900
about to happen with Tecmo and Koei.

1173
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:24,740
They have plans to, um, I guess merge in about two months.

1174
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:32,460
And, um, you know, I guess after rejecting Square Enix's, uh, attempt to take over Tecmo,

1175
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:40,860
they've decided to merge with Koei to release the most ultimate booby bouncing action game

1176
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:46,020
ever set in Fuel Japan, because that's the only thing I could see possibly coming from

1177
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,260
this sort of merger.

1178
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,940
Booby pizza?

1179
00:47:50,940 --> 00:48:01,220
But apparently, um, that they've announced, um, oh, this is actually very old news apparently

1180
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,160
and I don't understand how this slipped in.

1181
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,160
My bad.

1182
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,820
Apparently this already happened, like, a long time ago.

1183
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,340
I don't know how this guy makes it in there.

1184
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,340
It's not the news.

1185
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,340
It's the old.

1186
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,340
It is really old.

1187
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:21,020
So I'm like, look at this, it's all, has announced on September 17th, I'm like, what

1188
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,020
the fuck?

1189
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,220
And it's all September 18th.

1190
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,820
You know when I was putting this together tonight, I was kind of like, I thought that

1191
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,820
already happened, but I didn't really, you know, I was just so annoyed.

1192
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,820
My bad.

1193
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,820
But that's weird, though.

1194
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,580
Okay, just wait until you say, and see, we were just recapping what happened this year.

1195
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,060
Yes, we're totally recapping.

1196
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,060
Fuck this shit.

1197
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,060
You know what?

1198
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,860
I don't care if they merger, because you know what, they're still going to put out fucking

1199
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,360
Dynasty Warriors games out the ass.

1200
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,460
By the way, Dynasty Warriors, Six Empires comes out February.

1201
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,460
You know what?

1202
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,460
Fuck the show.

1203
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,460
Let's go get pizza.

1204
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,460
Really?

1205
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:56,420
The sad thing is, I'm half serious.

1206
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,700
If there was a way we could somehow, like, just take the camera and go out on the road

1207
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,340
and take it with us to get pizza, I would totally do it.

1208
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,620
I would say yes.

1209
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,860
I would say, the hell with the show, pizza.

1210
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,020
Anyway, sorry.

1211
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,000
We can't do that, Rob.

1212
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
We love our people.

1213
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,180
I know, we do love our people.

1214
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,220
Whatever, I give up, you know.

1215
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,860
I don't know how I went back that far.

1216
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,820
All right, well look, I have something that I promise is current, because just in time

1217
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,740
for the holidays, Konami sued someone.

1218
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,740
That's right.

1219
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,740
Konami loves to sue people over music games, and this week, who did Konami sue?

1220
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,100
Pentavision, the makers of DJ Max.

1221
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,060
That's right.

1222
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:40,300
They have claimed patent infringement, Konami has, and intellectual property rights infringement.

1223
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,800
This was Konami of Korea that actually did it, because they're, you know, filing this

1224
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,100
lawsuit against a Korean company.

1225
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,100
They filed it in the Seoul Central District Court in Korea.

1226
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,580
They want to get damages.

1227
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,020
They want to stop Pentavision from selling the offending products, quote unquote, which

1228
00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:02,460
of course has unleashed the outcries of not fair, unfair, Konami sues everybody and everything,

1229
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,660
and Konami, you suck, and da da da da da, and all this stuff, but I don't know.

1230
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,860
How do you guys feel about this?

1231
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,140
I mean, I don't know how many of you have played DJ Max.

1232
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,620
I've definitely seen the game played.

1233
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,580
I have a friend who's obsessed with it, and made it a point to show me, you know, DJ Max,

1234
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,980
and wanted to show me what the game was all about, and, you know, I did look at it and

1235
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:26,620
go, wow, this really looks like Beatmania.

1236
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,980
I mean, granted, I realize it's played with buttons, it's not exactly the same, but the

1237
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:37,300
look and feel was kind of the same, I'm sorry to say, you know, but I don't know.

1238
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,900
Do the people that say, hey, Konami just sues everything, is there a point here, what?

1239
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,100
What do you guys think?

1240
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:48,980
I'm really not surprised in the least, so I'm just going to roll my eyes and go next.

1241
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:55,300
I am surprised because I thought, you know, and I could be very wrong about this, but

1242
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:01,900
I thought that Pentavision, actually the company that makes DJ Max, came out of the company

1243
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:08,540
that made EZ2DJ, since most of the artists in DJ Max are from EZ2DJ.

1244
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:13,900
I would find that as a very big coincidence if that was not the case, but I would figure

1245
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:18,580
that it's more of a ripoff of EZ2DJ, and who cares?

1246
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:26,260
To be honest, I thought EZ2DJ was better than Beatmania anyways, so, whatever, and they're

1247
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:30,160
going to go ahead and sue them, probably because they're planning on making some crappy music

1248
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,420
game for the PSP or something, because, you know, Konami's on the latest and greatest

1249
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,140
trends for music games.

1250
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,300
Oh wait, no, they're not anymore.

1251
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,940
They're way behind everything.

1252
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,700
So Hanukkah Harry in chat says, is all a trap set up by Konami.

1253
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,500
By not releasing quality versions of Guitar Freak, Strummania, and Beatmania in the US,

1254
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,420
they are setting up other companies to come out with copies of them.

1255
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,760
Konami then sues them and gets a piece of the action without lifting a finger, except

1256
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,760
to call their lawyers.

1257
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,020
You know, as much as that makes sense, I don't think that's it.

1258
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,660
I don't think Konami in their minds thinks they're not doing a good enough job.

1259
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,780
I think Konami thinks Rock Revolution is a quality product.

1260
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:16,820
I think there are people at Konami, probably Konami Japan, that think that that is what

1261
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,260
people want.

1262
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:25,180
The Guitar Hero and Rock Band are the sub-par games.

1263
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:31,340
Rock Revolution is a wonderful game, and these other games are infringing on the rightful

1264
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,820
heir to the music game throne, which is Rock Revolution.

1265
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:41,700
The problem now is that they wanted to make a music game, and they're worried about fridging

1266
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,940
on other people's patents, and now, unfortunately, since they came out with a drum that's totally

1267
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:50,780
different than what Drummania had, the best thing they could do is come out with what

1268
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,900
they did for Drummania, basically, and bring it over here.

1269
00:52:53,900 --> 00:53:00,540
And at the time, it was kind of neat as a drum game, but things have gotten a lot better

1270
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:05,540
since then, and they can't come out with something that looks similar because they will get sued

1271
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:10,100
by the other companies, and there'll be kind of a 180 for them.

1272
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,700
Hanaka Harry wants to clarify, he was mostly joking with the comment, but I have seen that

1273
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,820
comment for real reals and different threads around the internet about this.

1274
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,900
And if you think I'm wrong in what I'm saying about that Konami of Japan is seriously disillusioned

1275
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,420
to their fan base, all you need to do is look at Beat and Groovy and Rock Revolution, because

1276
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,860
these are the products Konami is continuing to put out.

1277
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,340
Yeah, but see, I think in Japan, though, they're actually putting out some good games over

1278
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,340
there.

1279
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:38,460
Like, if you look, for example, at the new Dance Dance Revolution, what would be the

1280
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,080
equivalent of Hoz Party 2 over there on the Wii, it's actually a lot better than it is

1281
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,080
over here.

1282
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,460
Like, they have different types of music and stuff like that, which obviously applies to

1283
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,780
more of the people that play the Wii over there.

1284
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:56,580
And then you also have Juby and stuff like that, which look pretty good.

1285
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,820
But I don't know, I don't think necessarily, I think they don't really know what their

1286
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:07,480
audience is anymore, and that's pretty sad.

1287
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,700
But at the same time, they can't honestly look at Rock Revolution as a success, because

1288
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,700
it's not.

1289
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,740
I mean, look at how fast that thing price dropped.

1290
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:19,420
Look at the sales for it, I mean, I think they speak for themselves.

1291
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:24,140
It was a waste of effort on their part, and it wasn't much of an effort to begin with,

1292
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,300
so you get what you put into it, I guess.

1293
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:34,220
Here's my thought, and tell me if I'm off-base with this one, but I believe that if you're

1294
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:39,220
pissed off about this, whether you're a fan of DJ Max, or a fan of music games who is

1295
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:44,340
getting a little frustrated at Konami's putting out sub-par music games and then trying to

1296
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:48,740
take out these other guys, I think now's the time for you to take five minutes of your

1297
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,600
life to sit down and write an angry letter.

1298
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,600
And I don't mean an unprofessional letter, I mean an angry, concerned, person who spends

1299
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,240
money on Konami, letter.

1300
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,820
And I think you need to send them a letter and tell them exactly what you think.

1301
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:11,000
And don't use profanity, don't use words that you wouldn't say in front of your mother,

1302
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,540
but you need to tell them that you know what, that you find it's very wrong, that they would

1303
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,420
continue to sue these companies over-enteringing on the products when they are not putting

1304
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:23,420
out Beat Media games in the US, and that you really want to see, if they're going to stop

1305
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,080
these other products from coming out, that you want to see a new Beat Media game be released

1306
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,080
in the US.

1307
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,080
But here's the problem.

1308
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,080
What?

1309
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,460
They're suing them in Korea because these games are coming out in Korea.

1310
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,820
It's not anything to do with the US version.

1311
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,180
People are just figuring that because of that...

1312
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,940
Wait, wait, wait, but you don't think the US version had nothing to do with this?

1313
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,940
Yes, I don't.

1314
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,260
I think you're wrong.

1315
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,420
Because these Korean versions have been out for a while now, but isn't it funny?

1316
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,480
When did they sue the people that made In the Groove when the home version was announced?

1317
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,540
When are they suing the people that made the Penn Division thing when the US DJ Max was

1318
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,660
on its way out?

1319
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,660
There's a correlation there.

1320
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,500
I'm convinced that...

1321
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,860
I understand this is all going down in Korean court of law, but it's still an international

1322
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:13,060
company who has much bigger interests in the US and Japan.

1323
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,420
So I don't know.

1324
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,780
Dark Sakura, sometimes you like to give your input on these types of protests and business

1325
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,780
stories.

1326
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,500
What do you think would be the best thing for a person to do who's ticked off?

1327
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,780
Honestly, it's going to be send in your letters.

1328
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,780
Buy stock.

1329
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,780
Shit.

1330
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,700
What did we say before?

1331
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:37,600
Buy stock in the company, then you have a right to be heard as a shareholder.

1332
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,340
But don't post an angry thing on the internet.

1333
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:44,100
Post petition online, because you know what that's going to do?

1334
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,100
Nothing.

1335
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,100
Absolutely nothing.

1336
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:50,100
The only type of petition that's going to have any real swing is if you get your signatures,

1337
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:54,420
make a copy, and send it to Konami.

1338
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:00,060
Because then the people that are advocating for you at Konami, of which there have been

1339
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,160
some, look at Jason Enos.

1340
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,040
Would you have ever had DDR in the US without him?

1341
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,820
Don't think so.

1342
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,300
The people that are advocating for you there have something to take back to Japan and say,

1343
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:14,940
look, you are out of touch.

1344
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,940
Just saying.

1345
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,700
Anyhow, more gaming news, things going on in the gaming world.

1346
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,620
Dark Sakura?

1347
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,940
Let me see.

1348
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:32,120
Oh, just a little game that a few people were playing and then it went, um, started going

1349
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,460
poop.

1350
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,720
Tabula Rasa.

1351
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:45,260
So NCSoft is saying that Tabula Rasa is free to play and will be free to play until the

1352
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:51,300
28th of February, 2009, when they take down the servers.

1353
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:58,180
So you can actually get a serial code from the support website and download the client

1354
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,460
and you can play.

1355
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:06,080
So it will ask you for your credit card number, but they're not going to charge you for shit.

1356
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,580
So enjoy it while it lasts.

1357
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,360
That's just weird that they want your credit card number even though they're not actually

1358
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,360
going to charge you.

1359
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,020
Doesn't that seem a little weird?

1360
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,900
I think it's just because it's how the site's set up to do.

1361
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,220
I guess.

1362
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,740
But I bet there's a lot of people to get a little, maybe, maybe they want to make sure

1363
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:27,540
that they are like actual people and not like spam bots or something.

1364
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,540
Maybe.

1365
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,540
I don't know.

1366
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,540
That makes sense, but I don't see why they would care.

1367
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,540
Yeah, true.

1368
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,540
I mean, then again, it is their, their bandwidth.

1369
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,060
So true.

1370
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:37,900
Maybe it's a way to kind of like, even though it's free, it's like squelched a little bit

1371
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,340
so that only people who really want to do it, do it.

1372
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,340
I don't know.

1373
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,940
It could possibly be.

1374
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,940
Who knows?

1375
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,060
I mean, hey, free.

1376
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,900
Anybody here think they might check it out?

1377
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,900
No.

1378
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,900
Nope.

1379
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,900
I might.

1380
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,900
I might.

1381
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,500
I feel like I want to know what I'm missing.

1382
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,240
But it's kind of weird that they're doing this because what if suddenly people find

1383
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,460
that they really like this game?

1384
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,740
Well then that gives them incentive to put it back to P2P.

1385
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:01,740
I guess.

1386
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,740
We'll see.

1387
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,740
Moving on.

1388
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:08,420
Well, another virtual world that's doing pretty well right now is Home, and apparently they've

1389
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:13,580
had quite a boost for pay-for-content sales.

1390
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:17,060
And yes, unfortunately I did contribute a little bit to that.

1391
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,100
I'm so glad you said it so I didn't have to.

1392
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,020
Hey, it's just a little bit okay.

1393
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:29,860
But I guess during, in the first four days of the open beta, Home produced more money

1394
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:35,100
for Sony than the video download service did in its first week.

1395
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,220
I'm not surprised.

1396
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:44,100
And I guess the biggest sellers are the ridiculously priced Santa outfits.

1397
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,500
Huh.

1398
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,180
Oops.

1399
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:56,060
And yeah, they basically said it's a classic 80-20 model.

1400
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:04,540
20% of your consumers create 80% of your income, but there is a lot of stuff that you can purchase

1401
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,540
in it.

1402
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,260
I mean, they're going to be adding more to it.

1403
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,980
Honestly, other than purchasing that Santa outfit, I don't think I'm going to be buying

1404
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:13,980
anything else on this.

1405
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,480
And to be honest, I don't think I'm going to be wasting much time on Home anyways unless

1406
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,100
they really do something that's worthwhile.

1407
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,100
Because I tried playing one of the...

1408
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,880
Make your trophy room.

1409
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,880
Not even the trophy room.

1410
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,060
I mean, I tried playing one of the little UFO shooter games or something that was in

1411
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,100
there, and the whole thing crashed.

1412
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,100
Which was awesome.

1413
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,100
Nice.

1414
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,660
So I'm like, nope, I'm not wasting my time on this.

1415
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,720
The Ecochrome one's not bad.

1416
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,820
Is it just the Ecochrome demo, or?

1417
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,820
Um, kinda.

1418
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,580
It's like a little Ecochrome minigame.

1419
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,300
It's worth checking out.

1420
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,300
You know what's interesting though?

1421
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,900
They don't say, like, what was available on the store in the first week in the video store.

1422
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,880
Like maybe it's making not a fair comparison here, because maybe the video store had very

1423
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,260
slim pickings the first week.

1424
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,140
So it was like all old stuff.

1425
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,140
I mean, I don't know.

1426
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:00,020
I don't remember, because I didn't have a PS3 back then.

1427
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,020
I don't remember.

1428
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:05,540
I didn't use the video service, so I don't know.

1429
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,740
Some people are excited about Home though.

1430
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,740
We have Trishlicious in chat says, uh, gotta save some cash and get a PS3 for Home.

1431
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,740
I want to make content.

1432
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:15,780
Uh, AcidicVampire says, there are Ecochrome cults in Home.

1433
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,780
Seriously.

1434
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,140
I wouldn't be surprised.

1435
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,060
Ecochrome's kinda neat.

1436
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,060
It's different.

1437
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,420
Very different kind of game.

1438
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,500
Also talking about something else with Home, talking about some of the words that have

1439
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,180
been censored in Home, apparently it actually got picked up by the San Francisco Chronicle.

1440
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,740
The San Francisco Chronicle is writing a story about PlayStation Home, and it's kind of what

1441
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:39,420
makes it notable, because it was focusing the article on this gentleman, Michael Marsh,

1442
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,500
and he was actually trying to set up a gay straight alliance club in Home.

1443
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,180
He's a straight guy who's a supporter of gay rights.

1444
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:50,940
However, he found that the words gay and bisexual were not allowed in Sony's virtual world.

1445
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:57,020
Meaning that there were a lot of kind of words to be discovered that were not able to be

1446
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:03,500
used in Home, including hell, Christ, Jew, which by the way means all derivatives of

1447
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,740
those words cannot be used either.

1448
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:11,580
So you cannot say, hello, because it has hell in it.

1449
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:15,940
I'm not lying.

1450
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:20,900
And the San Francisco Chronicle ran a quote from this guy who was trying to set up the

1451
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:25,340
club, who I think sums up the way a lot of people are thinking, quote, I can understand

1452
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:30,100
that they're filtering out profanity, but it feels like it's discrimination.

1453
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:34,460
By blocking a word like gay, which is a preferred term by the gay community, you're encouraging

1454
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,260
it as a bad word.

1455
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:41,620
A city vampire in chat says gay is allowed now, so who knows, maybe Sony made a hot fix

1456
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,220
because of this news.

1457
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,500
Why don't people just get over it?

1458
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,500
The end.

1459
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,700
Get over it.

1460
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,940
My whole thing is that, you know, and somebody had posted this in a showreel thread saying

1461
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,900
this is probably a story that would piss me off.

1462
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:55,900
It kind of doesn't.

1463
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,800
I think it's more silly than anything else.

1464
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,260
It makes me think back on like, remember Phantasy Star Online?

1465
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,820
Like there were a bunch of words that you couldn't say because they had other words

1466
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:04,820
in them.

1467
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:08,160
Like I can't remember what some of the words were, but there were like normal everyday

1468
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,160
words you could say.

1469
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,580
Saturday because you can't say turd.

1470
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:14,900
Yeah, you can't say Saturday and things like that.

1471
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,220
It just reminds me of this.

1472
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,220
It's the same thing.

1473
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,020
Honestly, I don't know, it's not that big a deal to me.

1474
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,660
At least it's consistent.

1475
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,660
I don't know.

1476
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,660
But here's my thing.

1477
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,620
I don't think they should censor words at all.

1478
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,060
I think that people, because people will get around it.

1479
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,060
Exactly.

1480
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,420
Like Tiger Claw says they can spell it as H3LLO.

1481
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,420
How about this?

1482
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,900
Have an option where you can turn it on or off.

1483
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,020
Oh my god!

1484
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,020
Look at that!

1485
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:42,140
You can censor stuff or you can, you know, not censor stuff and maybe you can even have

1486
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:45,740
parental controls because everybody likes parental controls.

1487
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,420
Why can't services like this...

1488
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,340
Okay, here's my suggestion.

1489
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,480
Services like this should have a button.

1490
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,580
If I press that button on a user, then it should send the last 20 things that user has

1491
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:00,420
said to Sony so Sony can review it and decide if this person should be allowed to be in

1492
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,100
home anymore or not.

1493
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,560
If I'm abusing this, then I should have the button taken away from me.

1494
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,060
How hard is this?

1495
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,660
How hard would this system be?

1496
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:12,760
And then I think you should be able to say fucking shit and cock and gay and fag and

1497
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,660
all that stuff as much as you want.

1498
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:20,340
You can say any of it, just as long as you're, you know, not saying it to children or people

1499
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,900
that are, you know, are not your friends and should not be hearing it.

1500
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,620
Does that make sense?

1501
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,980
Or in your own little room apartment thing.

1502
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:28,980
Yeah.

1503
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,700
That's a little weird.

1504
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,940
Frisbee says don't spend the money on home or Second Life.

1505
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,940
Spend it on real life.

1506
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:38,700
Well, home is free, to be fair, but I don't know.

1507
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:44,380
I, you know, for me it was, I think, I can't remember how many pieces it took to make this

1508
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:50,340
Santa outfit, but it was like $2.50 and yeah, that's probably $2.50 more than I should have

1509
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:55,060
spent it on home, you know, but it's $2.50 and I was like, whatever, you know, I buy

1510
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:00,620
these stupid $5, $10 games from live and who cares?

1511
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,620
It's $2.50.

1512
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:05,620
SSJ100 Matt says in chat, asshole juice?

1513
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,140
Definitely banned.

1514
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,140
Definitely banned.

1515
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:12,700
GS68 says sophomore would be banned.

1516
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:17,540
It has homo in it, S-O-P-H-O-M-O-R-E.

1517
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,180
Probably another word that's banned in home.

1518
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,180
I don't know.

1519
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,300
You know, at least, at least it's consistent, but I don't know.

1520
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,700
Just I think this is a case of a few bad apples ruined the barrel for everyone and there's

1521
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,520
people that don't know how to use these words in proper context and because of these assholes,

1522
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,740
the rest of us have to pay the price of this hypersensitivity and hair trigger of which

1523
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:38,340
we've seen Sony use before.

1524
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:48,140
So, to these people who are just abusing with, you know, free speech and what is given to

1525
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,460
them, we dedicate the FUs of the week to you.

1526
01:05:51,460 --> 01:06:12,660
FU to Dalmore for being in Korea.

1527
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:18,700
I want to order eyeballs and wigs from that site and they're in Korea, so $20 pair of

1528
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:25,700
eyes, cost me $45 after EMS shipping, it's like a bunch of dad.

1529
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,700
Loki!

1530
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:35,580
FU to my need to buy yet another airsoft gun because I, you know, I bought a shotgun actually

1531
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,860
that's pretty cool.

1532
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,940
I thought it shot three rounds at once, but it doesn't, which is disappointing, but you

1533
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:46,160
can fire it pretty fast, which is cool.

1534
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:53,100
But I have this urge to have another AEG gun, and I really shouldn't buy another one.

1535
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,100
Arcade EM42, do you have any FUs of the week?

1536
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,980
FUs of the never-ending clutter in my apartment, which I never get around to.

1537
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:06,820
Hopefully I'll get the time off I have this week from one of my jobs is off, so get something

1538
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,820
every day, hopefully.

1539
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,980
I can actually clean the damn thing.

1540
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:13,020
You know, I think some of your clutter spilled over into the garage here somehow, I think

1541
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:16,100
you might have.

1542
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,460
I would like to say a big FU to the year 2008.

1543
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,460
Good riddance.

1544
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,460
I hate you.

1545
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:22,460
Goodbye.

1546
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,880
You are the weakest link.

1547
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,380
That's it.

1548
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,420
Let's get back into some gaming news now that we've gotten that angst off our chest.

1549
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,340
Do you feel better, Rob?

1550
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,340
Much.

1551
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,580
Well, how about Braid?

1552
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,980
I like to braid my hair now that it's long enough.

1553
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:37,980
Haha.

1554
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:38,980
Haha.

1555
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:44,140
But seriously, Braid, the game that came out for Xbox Live Arcade, is going to be out on

1556
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:48,780
the PC between February and March 2009.

1557
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:53,980
So they don't know if it's, they actually are also thinking that there's going to be

1558
01:07:53,980 --> 01:08:00,380
a Mac version 2, which would be cool, and no word yet if there's going to be a version

1559
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,380
for PS3.

1560
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,380
All right.

1561
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,380
Hm.

1562
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,380
Hm.

1563
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,380
Speaking of PS3.

1564
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,500
So there's games on the Mac, huh?

1565
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,500
A few.

1566
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:18,380
Speaking of the PS3, Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 2 is just released, and there is a

1567
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:22,900
problem with the game, unfortunately, that apparently a bunch of users are reporting

1568
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:27,140
that there is a glitch that renders their save files completely useless.

1569
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:32,300
Selecting a corrupted save file will freeze the gamers on a permanent loading screen.

1570
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:36,700
And apparently this is a, you know, something that's going to be patched soon, however,

1571
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:41,620
because of the holidays, Sony's QA department is taking a little break.

1572
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:48,180
So that means that the patch will not be available until after the new year, sometime in January.

1573
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,460
That sucks.

1574
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,020
Huh.

1575
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:56,180
This seems like the type of thing that Penny Arcade would have done a comic about.

1576
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,620
Is it just me?

1577
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,740
But somehow I don't think there will actually be one.

1578
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:04,340
Hey, speaking of patches, this has been a long awaited one.

1579
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:09,300
Castle Crashers apparently is finally getting its patch.

1580
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,140
That's only about four months late.

1581
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,100
The patch, I believe, went up this week.

1582
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:18,060
I think it actually was scheduled to go up on Christmas Day.

1583
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,820
No, Christmas Eve.

1584
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,420
I think it went up finally.

1585
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:27,420
So hey, you should go back and play some Castle Crashers, because now you can online anyway.

1586
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,060
So there you go.

1587
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:36,060
Apparently some extra things were thrown in as well, though, not just some fixes to the

1588
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:41,380
game, but apparently I think they did some other little, like, new things, like weapons

1589
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,140
and stuff like that, and two new characters.

1590
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,180
The king is one of them, and so on.

1591
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,180
And a chainsaw?

1592
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,180
Do I see a chainsaw?

1593
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,180
Yes, there is a new weapon, the chainsaw.

1594
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,180
Sweet!

1595
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,180
There you go.

1596
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,420
I'll have to play that now.

1597
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:57,740
So check that out if you, that's one of those titles I didn't pay money for, because everybody

1598
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,580
told me you really couldn't play it online.

1599
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,020
But maybe I'll go back and check it out now.

1600
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:04,780
But I still think, my gut tells me they'll put it on sale in three months' time, so I

1601
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,260
don't know, I might try to hold out.

1602
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:07,980
Game guru in chat says, Castle Crashers?

1603
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,980
What's that?

1604
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:09,980
Who cares about that anymore?

1605
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:13,260
A Twitch acidic vampire says, I like Castle Crashers.

1606
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,260
Cry.

1607
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:18,620
Anyway, let's move on.

1608
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,620
Moving forward...

1609
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:27,740
Oh, I'm sorry, I completely blanked.

1610
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:31,060
How about the Gizmondo?

1611
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,220
Do we remember this thing?

1612
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,220
How about it?

1613
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:37,340
Well, they are, once again, rescheduling the launch of the Gizmondo.

1614
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:40,060
They haven't given up.

1615
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:46,500
The quote says it's due to the economic climate in the US, as well as the rest of the world.

1616
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:52,460
Maybe it might have something to do with your product being crap.

1617
01:10:52,460 --> 01:11:00,300
At any rate, they were deciding to turn the Gizmondo into a smartphone with a 3D graphics

1618
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,020
chip and an open platform.

1619
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:08,740
So basically, they're just trying to make another gaming taco.

1620
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:09,740
But open platform?

1621
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:17,500
Yeah, they actually wanted to have an open source app store for the Apple store compatibility.

1622
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,340
Oh, now that's kind of nice.

1623
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,340
I like that.

1624
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:22,820
I like open.

1625
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:27,100
And they wanted to make the price point $99.

1626
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,580
So maybe...

1627
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,540
Still wouldn't buy it.

1628
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:32,540
You know what?

1629
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:38,400
I bet you anything that Duke Nukem Forever will be on it.

1630
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,900
You know what's funny, though, is that it's funny they want to go that route, but I probably

1631
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,420
wouldn't buy one just because of the fact that I have an iPhone, and so I can have the

1632
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,700
open stuff already.

1633
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,540
I can get almost anything on my iPhone.

1634
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,900
They're going to have to show me something I can get on their system that I cannot get

1635
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,300
on my phone.

1636
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,380
Lots of delays and revisions before the product's even released.

1637
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,380
That's what you can get with the Gizmondo.

1638
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,260
You know, I've got to say, though, I know you're not a big fan of the iPhones, Loki,

1639
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:10,000
but I've got to say, it is pretty impressive that I can have movies that I like and music

1640
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:18,440
and games and apps on my phone in my pocket everywhere I go.

1641
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:23,740
And you get a wonderful data plan that goes along with that that's really expensive.

1642
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,480
Congratulations.

1643
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,140
It's worth it, honestly.

1644
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,440
It's not worth it.

1645
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,500
One thing people forget, in my opinion, it's worth it.

1646
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:41,180
And well, like with my iPhone, for me and Dan, our overall cost went up by $10 only

1647
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:47,460
once we, you know, adjusted some stuff we were being overcharged for before, but still,

1648
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,460
I like it.

1649
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:49,460
I got katamari now.

1650
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:54,260
Uh, GS68 says, I have an iPod touch, thereby bypassing the phone plan thingy.

1651
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:57,580
Rama says, yeah, but Sky, my phone, does the same thing, and I don't have to pay an extra

1652
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,580
fee for it.

1653
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,580
There you go.

1654
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:00,580
Diverse opinions.

1655
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:04,100
No thanks, I will never own an Apple product.

1656
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,100
Never ever.

1657
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,860
I don't care if Nintendo had a fucking orgy with Apple and their next product is like

1658
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:15,160
super awesome virtual reality that pleasures me, I will not buy this fucking system if

1659
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,160
it's Apple.

1660
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,160
I'm sorry.

1661
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,380
I will never ever own anything.

1662
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:25,980
If they make a pacemaker that's the only pacemaker on the face of the planet that will save my

1663
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:31,460
life, I will say let me die before I even take that thing.

1664
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,460
Seriously.

1665
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,900
Never ever will I fall victim to them.

1666
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,300
Please somebody record this part of the show just in case, because you know there's going

1667
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:44,780
to be that day where Apple puts out bacon or something that Loki is going to have it,

1668
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:48,940
and we all have to remind him of this moment and say, told you so.

1669
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:54,740
Alright, anyways, apparently there is a new guitar here coming out.

1670
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:55,740
Shock!

1671
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:56,740
Is there a guitar hero?

1672
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:57,740
Really?

1673
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:58,740
That they would do that?

1674
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:03,260
Well this one's on the DS, yes I know, it's surprising, you know, what, three releases

1675
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,700
in a matter of months?

1676
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:13,140
But there is a new DS game coming out, it was actually found out through a description

1677
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:19,500
on the ESRB website, yes, Guitar Hero Modern Hits will be coming out and they've already

1678
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:23,180
figured out what three of the songs are going to be based on, this short description that

1679
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:29,540
was talking about, you know, possible offensive lyrics, well the three songs that are pretty

1680
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:35,300
much confirmed to be in the game, Sum 41's Still Waiting, Franz Ferdinand's The Fallen,

1681
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:41,260
and Paralyzer by Finger Eleven, and no word on when Modern Hits will be out, but you can

1682
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:45,380
better believe that there will be a ton more releases next year for Guitar Hero, both on

1683
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,620
the DS and probably on the rest of it.

1684
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:53,700
Is the DSi going to screw this all up, because, you know, it's going to be a different system,

1685
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,420
so will that expansion thing have problems or what?

1686
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,980
Here's the way I look at it, I don't think so because there's so many million DS systems

1687
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:07,580
out there already that, you know, big deal, there just will not be another version, or

1688
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:13,060
it will just not be compatible with, you know, the DSi.

1689
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:15,540
You think there will be several versions, or what?

1690
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:19,900
Well I just don't think that they'll put out a version for the DSi, or maybe the DSi gets

1691
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:29,600
drums or something stupid like that, I mean, honestly, they could maybe make a new peripheral

1692
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:36,380
for the DSi that would plug into the SD card slot, just a thought, you know, maybe a DSi

1693
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:40,960
only version or something like that.

1694
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,820
I don't think it's going to be an issue though, because like I said, there's so many systems

1695
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,820
out there right now for the DS.

1696
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:49,900
I'm actually kind of surprised that they're even releasing the DSi anytime soon in the

1697
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:56,500
US, because they're still selling tons and tons and tons of DSes, I mean, I would wait

1698
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:03,540
until it slows down before they release the DSi, and I think that they are going to probably

1699
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:09,980
release the DSi soon, just to try to get people to buy another DS, just like they did with

1700
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,380
the Game Boy Advance.

1701
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:16,860
Never forget how many times you bought the Game Boy Advance, or the Game Boy.

1702
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,260
How many times did they release it?

1703
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:24,460
You know, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Player, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy

1704
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,460
HD.

1705
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:26,460
Alright, we get it, we get it.

1706
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,460
Yeah.

1707
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:31,780
Alright, hey, another lawsuit going on in the Nintendo world, and it's Nintendo's getting

1708
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:37,580
sued over their DS Lite Charger, and it's because of a fire that happened in January

1709
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:39,460
of 2007 in Kentucky.

1710
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:43,700
Apparently the victims were compensated by the insurance company, as usually happens

1711
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,700
those types of things.

1712
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:51,540
The insurance company, though, filed a complaint against Nintendo now in the US District Court,

1713
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:56,460
saying quote, the DS was defective in design, manufacture, and or because it failed to warn

1714
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,680
consumers of dangers associated with it.

1715
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,580
Due to defects existing within the product, which caused a risk of overheating and fire,

1716
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:05,340
the product was recalled by Nintendo.

1717
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:09,700
So what makes this notable, in my opinion, is that you can't blame this on some crazy

1718
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:13,420
asshole, but now it's some crazy asshole's insurance company, no I'm just teasing, but

1719
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:17,860
you know, it's an insurance company suing Nintendo now.

1720
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:21,380
What do you guys think, hearing that this is coming from an actual other company, and

1721
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:25,660
this is Liberty Mutual, it's not some little podunk insurance company, is suing Nintendo

1722
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:26,660
over the charger.

1723
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:31,020
Do you think it's going to be a valid thing, do you think people are too sue happy?

1724
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,520
Any thoughts?

1725
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,140
I think that they forgot how hot the DS really is.

1726
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:40,140
So hot that it catches fire.

1727
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:47,500
Well, if it's a liability issue, and they haven't put in any type of significant warning

1728
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:53,380
that is negligence on the part of Nintendo, so yeah, it's a legitimate suit.

1729
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,860
I don't see any problem with it.

1730
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:56,860
Alright.

1731
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:03,820
Let's see, GS68 in chat says, I think everybody is trying to kill Nintendo with lawsuit-y

1732
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:04,820
death.

1733
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,900
You know who should sue Nintendo?

1734
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,900
Kami.

1735
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,380
Then the circle will be complete.

1736
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,860
It's the circle of lawsuits.

1737
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:15,860
Forget it.

1738
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:20,400
Hey, every week here on Orange Launch Radio, we like to highlight a game from the past.

1739
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:25,260
We like to kind of dig into the archives of gaming history and choose one game to highlight

1740
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:31,780
here on the program as the classic video game of the week.

1741
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:35,460
So let's travel through the halls of gaming history with Dark Soccer right now and hold

1742
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:40,700
her hand as she guides us to a game that you all should be checking out immediately.

1743
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:45,260
Rob put me to sleep with his...

1744
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:46,260
Shut up.

1745
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,260
Read the game.

1746
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:52,460
The game is Sonic Adventure.

1747
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,980
And I picked the best music ever.

1748
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,100
We want music, Rob.

1749
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,100
It's going to take a minute.

1750
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,100
Better not.

1751
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:03,100
We just have to play some of this.

1752
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:11,700
The, what is it, Speed Highway?

1753
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:12,700
Yep.

1754
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,700
Yep.

1755
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:26,660
I had to pick the Speed Highway music because that's honestly so much my favorite level

1756
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:31,180
of the game except for playing as Knuckles and then I like going through the Red Mountain

1757
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,180
with Knuckles.

1758
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:39,700
But anyways, Sonic Adventure, this is the game that made me buy my, that made me import

1759
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:44,980
my Dreamcast because I wanted to play this that badly.

1760
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:55,000
And so it came out actually on December 23rd, 1998 in Japan.

1761
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,920
And it was the first game in the Sonic Adventure series.

1762
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:10,700
It actually came out in America, the very final version, as Sonic Adventure International

1763
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:16,480
on September 9th, 1999 which was of course the Dreamcast launch date in America.

1764
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:24,440
I was in line, on September 14th, 1999 it came out in Europe and a little bit later

1765
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,980
that in Belgium and December 3rd in Australia.

1766
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:33,060
I just had to say that because I wanted to mention Belgium and Luxembourg.

1767
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:39,660
So moving forward, this is, I'm not going to say that it's the first Sonic game in 3D

1768
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:44,100
because, do you remember Sonic Jam?

1769
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,100
Was that the one on the Genesis?

1770
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:50,660
No, Sonic Jam was the Saturn release of all the Genesis and Game Gear and whatever versions.

1771
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:51,660
Oh right.

1772
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:56,140
And it had a middle level that was all 3D, it had different missions and stuff.

1773
01:20:56,140 --> 01:21:02,140
There's also Sonic 3D Blast was another one.

1774
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:09,140
And the bonus stages were?

1775
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:14,020
They were, they were in, yeah I guess they were in 3D-ish, weren't they?

1776
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:16,020
Sonic 2's bonus stage was 3D.

1777
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:19,060
Yeah, they went to a 3D box.

1778
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:23,780
At any rate, you've got, you basically have your set levels and you play through certain

1779
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:24,780
characters.

1780
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:28,300
Of course you've got Sonic, who is the main guy.

1781
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:34,620
You have Miles Tails Prower, which I think is cool.

1782
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:40,700
You've got Knuckles the Echidna, and I really, really, really, really would only ever play

1783
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:45,380
this game in Japanese because one of my favorite voice actors was Knuckles' voice actor, the

1784
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:49,380
video I never watched, Shubushi Yuki, was possibly, and he was really cool.

1785
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:55,260
He also was the boss, so it was like, I knew that voice!

1786
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:59,180
There's also Amy Rose, who beats shit with a hammer.

1787
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:06,220
There's Big the Cat, who fishes, and oh my god, I got turned into a fishy fishy fishy.

1788
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:12,220
There's E-102 Gamma, which is the robot, and you can play as Super Sonic once you've finished

1789
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:13,220
the game.

1790
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:17,780
And of course he's all gone all super sci-aging or whatever.

1791
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:30,140
You've also got Eggman for your bad guys, Chaos, who is a very weird little chao.

1792
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:35,940
You've got Tikal, who is another chicken kid who keeps showing up, Zero, which is another

1793
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:40,140
robot, and the little...

1794
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:46,060
I'm saying chao because I played it in Japanese first, so that's how they said it.

1795
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:52,500
But they're so cool, because who remembers the VMU, right?

1796
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:59,700
You can actually download a virtual pet, the A-Life system, and you can play chao adventure

1797
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,700
on your VMU.

1798
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,780
For people who played this on the GameCube, you would actually play it on your Game Boy

1799
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:07,780
Advance.

1800
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:12,820
And so you can raise your stats, and you actually can go into your little chao house level or

1801
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:17,380
whatever and play with them and see what they look like and feed them coconuts and do all

1802
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:20,340
kinds of bizarre crap with them.

1803
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:29,380
Some of the other robots are in Gamma's story, which are the E-series robots.

1804
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:32,220
Also Knights is in the game.

1805
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:40,340
Knights is, if you're going into the Casinopolis stage, there's actually a pinball area that's

1806
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:45,380
based on knights, and when you go through the little special tunnel, you're flying through

1807
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:51,300
a knights level, which is pretty cool.

1808
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:54,500
So it's basically...

1809
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:00,780
There's some, I guess, degree of RPG element to it, in fact it's just that it really has

1810
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:06,700
an in-depth story, and you find different things to advance your plot, and you just

1811
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:10,780
keep moving through it, but you've got your action stages and you've got your adventure

1812
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:14,060
levels, which is where I'm saying the RPG part of it comes into.

1813
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:22,820
And actually, for anyone who didn't know, the working title of this was Sonic RPG, and

1814
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:26,540
they were pretty good together.

1815
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:31,900
It's really fun, it's got a fantastic story to it, we actually, when we used our VCR,

1816
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,900
recorded a lot of playing.

1817
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:44,500
And actually, this game received a 38 out of 40 from Famitsu, and it's really, I don't

1818
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:51,580
think that they've been able to touch this since this one came out.

1819
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:58,340
Sonic Avenger 2 was okay, but this one just had everything, I mean from the sound effects

1820
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:05,540
when you get your bubbles or your shoes, and the ending music being the same when you step

1821
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:11,980
on the platform, being the ones that you release your little forest buddies out of, you know?

1822
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:17,380
It's just really, really awesome.

1823
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:18,860
See?

1824
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:21,100
That music?

1825
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:29,580
You know, all of your, it's just got the feel, you know, when you break open the robot creatures

1826
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:34,620
and little animals pop out of them, like in, you know, the old ones, it just had all those

1827
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:37,460
touches to it, it was fantastic.

1828
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:44,740
So Sonic Adventure is definitely, definitely the game to get.

1829
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:45,740
Looks like fun.

1830
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:49,300
I think I played it once, and it moved very fast.

1831
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,420
It's hard to follow for me, but I'm going to give it another go.

1832
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:58,740
Another thing though, for people who actually like to get different collections, Sonic Adventure

1833
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:07,040
DX Director's Cut is an enhanced version of it, and it has a mini-game collection where

1834
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:12,380
you actually can get 12 different Game Gear games.

1835
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:18,140
So you get Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Drift, Sonic Chaos, Sonic Labyrinth, Sonic the Hedgehog

1836
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:22,300
2, Sonic Spinball, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, which is another version of Puyo

1837
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:28,260
Puyo, Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic Drift 2, Tails Sky Patrol, Sonic Blast, and Tails the

1838
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,260
Enter.

1839
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,260
Done.

1840
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,260
Get it?

1841
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:37,100
All right, check it out, Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast, and didn't they remake this

1842
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,260
game, put it out again, like on the GameCube or something?

1843
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,260
That's what I was saying.

1844
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,260
Oh yeah.

1845
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,260
Talking about the GameCube version.

1846
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,260
There you go.

1847
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,140
Okay, there you have it, your classic game of the week, and we'll have another one next

1848
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:47,140
week for you guys.

1849
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:50,220
In the meantime, we're going to take a break, and when we come back, we have a little bit

1850
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:52,700
of news in Part B, but mostly you guys.

1851
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:59,020
We're going to be doing the mailbag and some quick calls tonight, and we also want you

1852
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:01,200
guys to do this during tonight's break.

1853
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:06,580
We're going to be putting together the Orange Lounge Radio Top 3 Games of 2008.

1854
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:11,340
So if you want to participate, all you need to do is send in your votes right now, your

1855
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:16,700
top 1, 2, and 3 game of 2008 using any criteria you want, and I'll compile it all together

1856
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:22,020
during the break, and we'll have ourselves a list that myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and

1857
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:24,780
maybe Brad, even though he said he didn't play anything this year, maybe we can get

1858
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:29,460
him to think of three games, and we're going to do that, as well as a list list later tonight.

1859
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,540
So go ahead and send me those games, and we'll tally it up.

1860
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:35,020
Make sure you label it, though, 1, 2, and 3, and don't send me other private messages

1861
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:38,100
because they'll get lost amongst the other tabulation.

1862
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:47,860
So we'll do that, and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1863
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:52,780
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this December 28th of 2008 for the

1864
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:56,920
307th episode of our show, the last show of 2008.

1865
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:01,900
As we get ready to move into 2009, if you can believe it, our seventh year of broadcasting.

1866
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:06,300
I almost said podcasting, but that's not true because we didn't start podcasting until,

1867
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,660
well, podcasting was actually around.

1868
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:12,460
So anyhow, we got more news to get into, just a little bit, but then we're going to get

1869
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:17,540
into some year-end wrap-ups and talk about our favorite games of 2008, as well as the

1870
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,300
biggest stories of the year.

1871
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,740
Lots and lots to talk about.

1872
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:23,140
Let's kick it off with a little bit more news from this week, though.

1873
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:26,940
It was a surprisingly busy week, considering it was a holiday and everything, but stuff

1874
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,580
going on, right, Loki?

1875
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:29,580
Yes.

1876
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:37,020
According to CNET, it looks like Microsoft is wanting to add to the user experience and

1877
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:43,580
design for the Zune group, and they're going to focus now on the Zune user interface, a

1878
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:52,020
Zune PC application used to access the Zune Marketplace, and the Zune Xbox application.

1879
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,980
What exactly is this application?

1880
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:55,980
Who knows?

1881
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:02,500
We've already seen a couple things being demonstrated before in the past.

1882
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,140
Live Anywhere comes to mind.

1883
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:07,900
Perhaps that's going to be integrated into the Zune.

1884
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:10,140
Maybe you'll get to see when your friends are online, whether they're playing that kind

1885
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:11,740
of stuff.

1886
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:15,460
Possibly even XNA games, because I know that was something that was shown off.

1887
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:17,220
I'm not sure if that's been implemented yet.

1888
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:18,860
That would be pretty awesome.

1889
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:22,540
So some of those.

1890
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:25,780
Very interesting, and who knows?

1891
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:30,740
I wouldn't doubt seeing that there may be a music download service coming at some point.

1892
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:36,180
Since they do have the Zune Marketplace and it does happen to take Microsoft points, why

1893
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:44,140
not integrate that into Xbox Live and maybe allow users to be able to, say, sync the music

1894
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:48,740
that they have on their Zune with their 360, vice versa, because it's all tied with your

1895
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:49,740
Zune ID.

1896
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:54,340
That might be kind of cool, especially for custom soundtracks and games and all that

1897
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:55,340
stuff.

1898
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:56,740
Might be interesting.

1899
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,400
Very interesting.

1900
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,580
Also interesting, this collaboration we're hearing about, it's a rumor.

1901
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,580
Take this with a heavy grain of salt right now.

1902
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:06,260
But remember the game Deus Ex?

1903
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:07,260
Remember that game?

1904
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:08,260
Yeah.

1905
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:12,700
That was, what, they had like two games, maybe, no, I think there were two games in that series.

1906
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:18,020
I think I remember checking it out on GameTab a long, long, long time ago.

1907
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:22,700
The whole series was designed by this guy, Warren Spector.

1908
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:27,420
It's very interesting, he said at one point, I guess, what, way back in like June 2007

1909
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:34,020
that he was working on a new project and folks would tell him that he is sold out, at least

1910
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:37,340
that's what hardcore gamers would say, that he's sold out.

1911
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:44,060
Apparently what this guy is working on, and this is from, I guess, some type of tipster

1912
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:49,780
to the website Gamasutra, the project title that is being worked on right now is Epic

1913
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:52,820
Mickey.

1914
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:57,020
Apparently this game has a distinctly shadowed steampunk vibe.

1915
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:01,880
Now however, I don't, this is the part I don't understand, is that they are saying that maybe

1916
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,460
it's talking about Mickey as in Mickey Mouse?

1917
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,460
But I don't think so.

1918
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,700
I think it's just saying the title of the project is Epic Mickey.

1919
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,440
I think some of these other websites are jumping to conclusions and that it is actually Mickey

1920
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,440
Mouse.

1921
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:17,540
Although I guess if you put it all together, I've sold out and the project is Epic Mickey.

1922
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:21,780
Could it be that there is some type of Epic Mickey Mouse game being made?

1923
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,780
Maybe it's Epic Fail.

1924
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:25,740
Or Epic Mickey Rourke.

1925
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:28,380
My thought is though, isn't Epic Mickey Kingdom Hearts?

1926
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,020
I mean, what could this guy be doing that is different than that?

1927
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,780
Does that make sense?

1928
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,780
I don't know.

1929
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:40,180
But apparently it goes all the way back to referencing something that, you know, the

1930
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:46,460
rumor guy on Electronic Gaming Monthly had said that apparently it actually ties into

1931
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:49,460
that Specter is working on, in fact, a Disney product.

1932
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:52,740
So that's what kind of all, where it all ties together.

1933
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,740
Very interesting.

1934
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:58,100
And that apparently it could be actually a game where Mickey does battle with Mario.

1935
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,460
Isn't that weird?

1936
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:00,460
That would be stupid.

1937
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:02,980
That sounds like a fanboy, something they wrote out on paper.

1938
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:03,980
I don't know.

1939
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,940
Mickey is never going to do battle with Mario.

1940
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,860
Well again, how is that really different from Kingdom Hearts?

1941
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:09,580
Does that make sense?

1942
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:12,620
Yeah, but what if, say, yeah, I don't know.

1943
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:16,440
Maybe they're getting greedy and they just want, you know, their own Kingdom Hearts where

1944
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,940
they get all the profits.

1945
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,940
GSCCA says Mushroom Kingdom Hearts?

1946
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:21,940
It's a nice thought.

1947
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:25,100
I mean, like, maybe it's a Nintendo Wii game.

1948
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,540
I mean, you want to talk about selling out?

1949
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:30,980
This guy's making a game that involves Mickey and Mario on the Nintendo Wii.

1950
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:34,140
Oh my god, could they do a Mario RPG too?

1951
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:35,380
Now we're talking.

1952
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,380
Now we're talking.

1953
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:39,780
But they can't do it without Square Enix, sorry, because that would be epic fail.

1954
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:44,340
Well maybe it will be for the Nintendo Wii what Sony has for Kingdom Hearts, if that

1955
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:45,340
makes sense.

1956
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:46,340
I don't know.

1957
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,900
It could be interesting.

1958
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,660
Could be interesting.

1959
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:56,660
But I think there's a lot of in-between-the-line reading going on in this particular story.

1960
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:00,060
So I think we ought to just wait until this guy decides to tell us what he's working on.

1961
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:01,060
Could be.

1962
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,060
Alright.

1963
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:06,820
Game Guru in chat says Mario and Mickey at the Olympic Games?

1964
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:07,820
Could be, could be.

1965
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:12,300
Hey, we want to take a moment here to look back on the year 2008 and our favorite games

1966
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:16,740
of the year 2008, and we've actually kind of combined it, or we'll be combining it here

1967
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:21,900
with votes that you submitted during the break here live in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com.

1968
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,620
We've closed the polls there.

1969
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:28,940
And now we're going to add to it our favorite games of 2008, using any criteria we want.

1970
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:31,580
That's why we don't like to say the top games of 2008.

1971
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:35,980
No, they're our favorite games of 2008, using any criteria we want.

1972
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:38,780
So if we want to put some game you think is crappy on there, too bad.

1973
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:42,580
It's our favorite games of 2008, and then I'll let you know what collectively is in

1974
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:45,380
all our listenership we came up with.

1975
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:50,340
Dark Sakura, what was your number three favorite- how appropriate this music comes on, just

1976
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:51,340
the right time.

1977
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:56,780
What would you say was your number three favorite video game in the year 2008?

1978
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:57,780
Rock Band 2.

1979
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:58,780
Rock Band 2.

1980
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:02,020
Any particular reason why?

1981
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:04,460
Do I need to name them all?

1982
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:06,420
Really?

1983
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:11,420
It's just such a massive library.

1984
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:16,700
Having the different instruments and everything, even on top of that, you could import your

1985
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:19,300
list from the first Guitar Hero and it would all work.

1986
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:20,300
You mean Rock Band?

1987
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:21,300
Rock Band.

1988
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:22,300
You know what I mean?

1989
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,300
That's right.

1990
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,300
This brings me to my next point.

1991
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:26,700
The one thing that it did not have going for it is the guitars.

1992
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:32,140
The guitars suck, and I would only use the Guitar Hero guitars.

1993
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:38,380
This is a game that narrowly missed being on my list, but I love this game.

1994
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:41,780
What did you think, though, compared to the first game?

1995
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:45,100
At first, when I first sat down with Rock Band 2, I was kind of like, eh, this feels

1996
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,100
like Rock Band 1.5.

1997
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:48,860
I think that might be part of the reason it didn't make my top three is because I do feel

1998
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:53,980
like it was an upgrade of what I played last year, but there is a lot of new, cool stuff.

1999
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:54,980
You know what I mean?

2000
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:55,980
There is enough.

2001
01:34:55,980 --> 01:35:00,580
The multiplayer, when you make your band, you can actually save your character per your

2002
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:06,180
account, and I think that's a lot better, because it was really irritating going back

2003
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:10,820
to playing the first Rock Band over at my friend's house and having to save my character

2004
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:12,980
on her profile.

2005
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:13,980
It was really irritating.

2006
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:14,980
Okay.

2007
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:17,660
Loki, what was your number three favorite game of the year?

2008
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,900
Yeah, that's tough.

2009
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,780
Let me narrow it down.

2010
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:25,100
Let's see, and we're going to try to be a little different here.

2011
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:32,780
Lost Odyssey, because Lost Odyssey this year was the only game that I feel is as close

2012
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:39,180
to Final Fantasy as we're going to have in a while, until Final Fantasy XIII, and people

2013
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:43,980
thought maybe Last Remnant, maybe some of these other games that had come out, no.

2014
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:48,260
Lost Odyssey is the closest thing you're going to get to Final Fantasy XIII until XIII comes

2015
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,260
out.

2016
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:50,700
It plays exactly like a Final Fantasy game.

2017
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:54,900
And just even apart from the Final Fantasy series, it was a good game with a good story.

2018
01:35:54,900 --> 01:36:00,140
Another game that narrowly missed my top three, that I thought was still incredibly good.

2019
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:02,060
And again, I need to go back and finish.

2020
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,060
Maybe part of the reason I didn't.

2021
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,660
Yes, I need to finish it too.

2022
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:06,780
I'm only a little ways into it.

2023
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:07,780
Bradley, I have no idea.

2024
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,780
Did you make a top three list?

2025
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:10,780
I don't know if you played enough games this year or what.

2026
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:14,500
I actually thought of three games that came out this year that I actually played.

2027
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,500
Excellent!

2028
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,500
What was your number three pick, Bradley?

2029
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:17,500
I played only three games.

2030
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,300
I think I bought one or two other that came out this year, but I didn't get around to

2031
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,300
playing them.

2032
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:22,300
That's all right.

2033
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:27,420
So, number three, at the bottom of the list I played this year, but it's not bad, but

2034
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:31,380
it's just DDR, DDRX.

2035
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:36,220
And I actually only played like a few hours of it, and the stories are weird.

2036
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:39,380
Whoa, they put stories in DDR?

2037
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:45,820
There's this weird thing, they have the different stories for characters.

2038
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:49,460
The first two, I think there's one or two characters that are unlocked at the beginning,

2039
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:55,340
which is, I think it's Emi, and there's a new guy named Zero, who's like, the Zero guy,

2040
01:36:55,340 --> 01:37:01,460
he's just like the stoic sort of guy, he doesn't say very much, he's kind of, ugh, whatever.

2041
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:06,540
Sort of like a weird Bishonen looking kind of guy, he's just like feh, because they do

2042
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:10,660
this little story thing where they do something weird with each character, and then they do

2043
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:15,620
a dance battle, either do a dance battle with somebody or just, oh, show off your moves.

2044
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,820
Sounds too much like you got served to me.

2045
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,860
Yeah, it's kind of silly.

2046
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:24,260
Alright, well you know what though, I'm glad DDR is represented somewhere on the list,

2047
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:31,380
because we did start up as a Bimani based radio station, so why not?

2048
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:35,180
My number three game that I would pick on the list of the top three games that were

2049
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:41,260
released in 2008, even though it's funny because I just said I didn't put a game on there because

2050
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:46,540
it felt like a remake of an old game, my number three game on my list is a remake, but it's

2051
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:49,940
a damn good one, and it's one that needed to be brought to the forefront because too

2052
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:53,940
many people overlooked it the first time it came out, and that is Res HD, is my third

2053
01:37:53,940 --> 01:38:01,780
favorite game of 2008, because I just think this game is an experience.

2054
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:03,900
It is, god, I just love this game.

2055
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:08,860
Even though at its premise it's a relatively simple rail shooter, I think just turning

2056
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:15,100
off all the lights inside the living room, turning on this game on your big HD TV, putting

2057
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:23,980
those controllers on your lap or on your back or whatever they recommend you do, it's just

2058
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:24,980
awesome.

2059
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:29,720
It's a totally experience that I just don't get with a lot of other games, and so I really

2060
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:36,020
love Res, so yes, make all the vibration jokes you want, but yes, Res HD is my number three

2061
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:39,300
favorite game of 2008.

2062
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,320
Dark Sakura, your number two favorite game of 2008.

2063
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:47,180
My number two game would be Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

2064
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:49,980
Ah, any particular reason why?

2065
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:55,860
Dude, it's freaking, I only really played as Ken and Jun because I'm the big gachamon

2066
01:38:55,860 --> 01:39:03,740
fangirl, but it's really cool, it had actually so many different touches that if you were

2067
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:10,440
fans of the old Tatsunoko series, it's just like big fangasm right then and there.

2068
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:16,220
So many good touches, except for the Happy Thumb Ball of Doom, I hated the Happy Thumb

2069
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:21,860
Ball of Doom, but the rest of it was pretty freaking fun, and it's just like playing Marvel

2070
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:49,460
vs. Capcom in its control, it was really cool.

2071
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:52,940
The characters we knew were going to be good, but you know you've heard of projects like

2072
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:56,780
these and you go, oh boy, it's kind of like games based off movies, you're always kind

2073
01:39:56,780 --> 01:40:00,340
of like, oh boy, these are going to kind of stink, but the game was surprisingly decent,

2074
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:01,660
so I can see that.

2075
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:04,340
Loki, your number two game of the year.

2076
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:09,200
My number two game of the year, it's tough.

2077
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:16,300
I would, I guess I'm just going to have to go with Saints Row 2.

2078
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:17,300
Saints Row 2.

2079
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:26,740
I love my sandbox games, and you know, unfortunately I can't add Left 4 Dead or Fallout 3, I'm

2080
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:33,020
not going to talk about Fable 2, and oh man, there's other games I would like to play,

2081
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:39,820
or I'd like to have on my list here, but Saints Row 2 was actually, I thought, a little bit

2082
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:45,140
better than, or more fun for me than Granthathot of 4, even though I still play Granthathot

2083
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:50,980
of 4 today, but, and that is pretty fun, especially now that I can mod it, but it was an overall

2084
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:55,220
fun game, and I really can't wait for the next one to come out.

2085
01:40:55,220 --> 01:41:02,020
Saints Row 3, in 2010 maybe, alright, awesome, we know you never shut up about that game

2086
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:05,580
on the show, so it's no surprise that's showing up on your list, but that's cool, sandbox

2087
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:07,380
games can be a lot of fun.

2088
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:09,520
Bradley, number two, for you.

2089
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:16,940
This game had the unfortunate circumstance that I picked up Zelda Phantom Hourglass and

2090
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:21,420
didn't get back to it, but, since it's the other game that I played this year, it's Sonic

2091
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:26,860
Chronicles, the Dark Brotherhood, and I only got to like, maybe the third mission, but

2092
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:37,300
it's pretty fun, but Zelda just took over, so, but it's not too bad.

2093
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:43,660
Alright, Sonic Chronicles, what every Sonic fan should, you know, be checking out probably,

2094
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:44,660
right?

2095
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:45,660
Maybe?

2096
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:46,660
I don't know.

2097
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:54,100
Alright, my number two game that I put on my list was a game that came out for a relatively

2098
01:41:54,100 --> 01:42:01,020
low price, and was, again, it was an experience, and it was also on Xbox Live Arcade, it was

2099
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:05,700
a good year for Xbox Live Arcade, Braid was my number two pick of game I enjoyed this

2100
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:08,220
year.

2101
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:14,100
You know, that whole games as art thing, I mean, the game just moves like a painting,

2102
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:22,240
has a surprisingly great story with depth, and is a puzzler game that's got a pretty

2103
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:25,300
interesting twist on the whole usual 2D platformer.

2104
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:28,580
I had a lot of fun with it, and it wasn't something, you know, it felt very rewarding

2105
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:33,380
when you actually beat a puzzle, even though it was tempting to use walkthroughs, if you

2106
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:37,180
stick with it, it's going to be very rewarding to beat some of the puzzles.

2107
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:41,140
So I picked Braid, because I thought that game was great.

2108
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:45,820
Alright, number one favorite game all freaking year, Dark Sakura.

2109
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:47,900
I'd say Castlevania, Order of Ecclesia.

2110
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:48,900
Oh!

2111
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:54,800
It's been pissing me the hell off, but I've been having the most fun with it, so it definitely,

2112
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:58,940
it gets back to, I think, what made Symphony of the Night fun, so.

2113
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:00,580
Alright.

2114
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:03,620
Even though that game frustrates me to no end, it was pretty cool.

2115
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:05,780
Alright, Loki.

2116
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:10,420
Your number one favorite game all freaking year.

2117
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:14,620
You know, I'd normally go with Grand Theft Auto IV, because, you know, it's Grand Theft

2118
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:20,200
Auto, but actually, I'm going to have to say Little Big Planet, just because of, it was

2119
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,200
just a fun game.

2120
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:26,140
I mean, it's hard to really pick one game, but Little Big Planet, this is definitely

2121
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:31,460
a game I could see myself playing, you know, months from now, so, out to go with Little

2122
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:32,460
Big Planet.

2123
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:33,460
Alright.

2124
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:35,700
Little Big Planet.

2125
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:39,260
Lots to do in Little Big Planet, lots of replayability value.

2126
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:43,420
Bradley, your number one favorite game of 2008.

2127
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:48,620
And it's actually not even, maybe, not exactly a game, but it has games in it, I've learned

2128
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:54,180
that it's what I actually have on my DS right now, playing, it's My Japanese Coach, and

2129
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:58,460
I'll let it speak for itself.

2130
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:07,700
Hey, I hope you heard that.

2131
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:12,720
That's what I love about this show, you really can use any criteria you want, so if you want

2132
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:16,220
to put My Japanese Coach as your number one game of the year, you go ahead.

2133
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:22,500
Yeah, that's good for learning, and I actually recommend it if you want to learn Japanese.

2134
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:27,140
If you're just starting out, you probably want to have some help, or get into a class,

2135
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:31,740
but this would also be good to help along in, especially if it's good if you've forgotten

2136
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:35,880
a lot and need to get back in, get your skills back up.

2137
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:39,460
A shout out for the educational games, there you go.

2138
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:43,620
Alright, my number one game of the year, you know what, you've been listening to this show

2139
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:47,020
long enough, you know me well enough, what do you think?

2140
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:49,380
My number one game of the year, this shouldn't be hard.

2141
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:51,820
Super Metroid.

2142
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:54,300
Maybe about 15 years ago, yes.

2143
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,140
Or number one game of all time, maybe.

2144
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:59,020
Loki, I know you've got to know.

2145
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:01,200
Sing Star Abba.

2146
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:05,020
That's a damn good pick, and I am very tempted to put that on my list, but no, I tried to

2147
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:11,700
be halfway serious with this list, and as much as I love Sing Star Abba for its nostalgia

2148
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:16,500
value for me, the game itself needs some improvement.

2149
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,400
But Loki, try again.

2150
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,720
If I'm being serious, what do you think the number one?

2151
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:21,720
Little Big Planet.

2152
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:25,900
You're absolutely right, Little Big Planet is my number one favorite game of 2008, because

2153
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:30,420
I think this game is amazing.

2154
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:35,740
Despite all the hubble we had about the moderation that went on earlier this year, I mean, God,

2155
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:41,260
I wouldn't even need half of that, and those user-created levels in the game itself, even

2156
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:46,260
by itself, is amazing, and I'm having a wonderful time with it, and the potential that this

2157
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:51,420
game has for expansion is awesome, and now that they gave Sackboy a gun, it's even better,

2158
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:55,100
and this game is amazing.

2159
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,900
So I love Little Big Planet, it's my number one game of the year.

2160
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:04,300
Now, we put our votes together with you guys in the chat room, and kind of some surprising

2161
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:05,300
results.

2162
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:11,100
If we were to put together, you guys had picks all up and down the spectrum, and all throughout

2163
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:14,540
the spectrum of gaming, like you probably named like 40 different games between you

2164
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:16,180
guys.

2165
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:19,840
Here's the interesting thing, if we were to put our list together with the chat room,

2166
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:24,520
there would be a tie for the number one game of 2008, with Little Big Planet, because Loki

2167
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:27,900
and I naming it as number one game of the year probably helps, but get this, you know

2168
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:29,020
what the other number one game would be?

2169
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:33,180
It would be one none of us named, Mega Man 9, would be the game of the year.

2170
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:35,180
That's worthy.

2171
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:40,380
That retro throwback, and even Little Big Planet has a little bit of that sense in it,

2172
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:47,020
the whole 2D platformer with it, definitely our fans are big on the throwbacks.

2173
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:52,460
You see, also surprising what would come in second place, kind of some ties all around

2174
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:58,260
here, we have Left 4 Dead, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, and Rock Band 2.

2175
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:02,020
So even though somebody named Rock Band 2, nobody named the other ones, and those were

2176
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:06,300
very well loved amongst our listeners, Brawl, probably the Wii title to have this year,

2177
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:10,520
and Left 4 Dead, which as far as shooters go has been pretty amazing.

2178
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:14,660
And then third place would be yet another one we didn't even name, Fallout 3.

2179
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:17,860
But obviously the topic of that's come up earlier in the show, and at least for me that's

2180
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:21,980
one of those games that I'll get to it when it comes down in price a little later on after

2181
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:25,960
I finish these other games I want to play.

2182
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:30,660
So there it is, your favorite games of 2008.

2183
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:33,700
Very interesting to see some of the other things that people picked.

2184
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:39,260
Castle Crashers, DJ Max, Wii Sports, somebody put in their list, even two years later shows

2185
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:43,860
you the staying power of a game like that, Gears of War 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo

2186
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:53,460
HD Remix, Fable 2, Castle Crashers, Tomb Raider, the new one, Bionic Commander Rearmed, Chrono

2187
01:47:53,460 --> 01:48:02,660
Trigger DS, Bioshock, Mario Kart Wii, NHL 2009, the list goes on and on.

2188
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:04,840
Very nice.

2189
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:07,100
Pretty good year for games overall?

2190
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:08,700
I would say so.

2191
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:12,300
I would say yes unless you're the Nintendo Wii, I think the Nintendo Wii had maybe one

2192
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:17,180
or two great games on it, and the rest was shovelware in my opinion.

2193
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:20,380
Loki, was it a good year for games in 2008?

2194
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:21,940
It was okay.

2195
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:22,940
It was okay.

2196
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:26,420
All right, let's see if it was a good year for The Mailbag.

2197
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:30,940
Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and we

2198
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:35,660
read some of your mail right here on this program in a little segment we appropriately

2199
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:44,540
call The Mailbag.

2200
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:46,980
Well we've only got one email.

2201
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:47,980
Just one.

2202
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:48,980
Fail.

2203
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:51,180
Well, it's a decent one though.

2204
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:56,300
Hey OLR, season's greetings and all the rest, excellent job with the show, I really enjoy

2205
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,300
it.

2206
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,300
Thank you.

2207
01:48:58,300 --> 01:48:59,620
I have a small question about reviews.

2208
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:03,020
I know you guys review games on your own show quite frequently.

2209
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:05,660
Depends on if they suck, how much they suck, etc.

2210
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:09,580
I must confess that I'm a bit of a casual gamer and also a poor college student, so

2211
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:12,580
don't have any money to pick up every game you guys review.

2212
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:17,340
However, when I do decide to pick up a game, I usually look at games that came out quasi

2213
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:21,740
recently and take into account what you guys said about it.

2214
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:25,540
That being said, I can't go through every episode to find the exact spot where you reviewed

2215
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:26,540
a certain game.

2216
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:31,620
I poked around the forums a bit, and I can't find a lot of places where you reviewed games.

2217
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:35,020
I know this might take up a little more of your time, but wouldn't it be cool if you

2218
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:40,100
had a place where you just had a little snippet of what you said about a game, gave it a thumbs

2219
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:45,460
up or thumbs down, and limited this to only the popular or big title games that came out.

2220
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:49,060
For example, I remember this guy recently liked Little Big Planet, but I can't remember

2221
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:51,580
what Dark Sakura said about Animal Crossing.

2222
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:54,200
It was the same, by the way.

2223
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:58,260
Even if not all of you played the game, I still value each of your opinions because

2224
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,500
you guys never seem to leave me astray.

2225
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:04,940
I'm not proposing an entire archive of what everyone nitpicked about every single aspect

2226
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:05,940
of each game.

2227
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:09,940
I'm just looking for an easy, and preferably online, way to find out if you approved of

2228
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:12,380
a certain game before I go and get it.

2229
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:13,380
Just something to think about.

2230
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:38,180
I hope your holidays are awesome, Amplitude.

2231
01:50:38,180 --> 01:51:05,940
Well I will tell you this, that Sauce actually has a review blog that we've talked about

2232
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:15,140
some reviews on there before, but it's at Avengers-Tower.com, I think it is?

2233
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:19,340
And she puts up a lot of reviews there, and I was actually kind of thinking about getting

2234
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:26,920
back into blogging some game related stuff, since I'm actually playing things a bit more,

2235
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:33,120
and actually since I'm chatting with her, she suggested get a Gamefly account too.

2236
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:37,620
If you guys know anyone who is really good at website design, and I mean really serious

2237
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,620
inquiries on me-

2238
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:39,620
Oh, there's no Dash in that, by the way.

2239
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:40,620
Oh.

2240
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:41,620
Just Avengers Tower.

2241
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:42,620
Please send them my way.

2242
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:46,340
And I'm not talking about hosting or admin, because we have a guy who does that who is

2243
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:50,900
amazing, but I'm talking about the design itself of a website and being able to run

2244
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:51,900
it.

2245
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:57,120
I would even be willing to throw money out there if it's not too extreme, so get in touch

2246
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:58,120
with me.

2247
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:00,780
A lot of times, and maybe you've tried to before, but it fell through the cracks because

2248
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:04,580
you get a lot of freaking spam, but I'll try to keep my eye out over the next week.

2249
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:11,920
If you have ideas on how we can get OLR's website functional for types of requests like

2250
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:17,140
this, I would love to hear it, because unfortunately, with a full-time job and school and stuff,

2251
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:18,140
we got no time.

2252
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:20,620
Yeah, we were using WinMatter before, or using-

2253
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:23,220
We're still using PHP Nuke, and it's just an old system.

2254
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:26,620
No, I meant for our old blog that we used to have.

2255
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:27,620
Old blog?

2256
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:29,820
Yeah, remember the blog that we had up way back in the day?

2257
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:30,820
God, yeah.

2258
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:33,820
I think it was called GrayMatter or something like that.

2259
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:35,020
That was old.

2260
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:37,780
We could probably throw up a WordPress easy, but I don't know.

2261
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:40,860
WordPress was what we used.

2262
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:45,340
We could just try reviving that too.

2263
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:48,860
The website as it is today has just kind of looked the same for the past four years.

2264
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:53,060
I'm ready to nuke it and try something else, kind of like how they blew up the Stardust

2265
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:54,060
for building a new hotel.

2266
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,060
PHP Nuke!

2267
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:56,060
Yeah, exactly.

2268
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:57,060
Nuke!

2269
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:59,780
Explore the nuke in PHP Nuke.

2270
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:02,180
We don't need help in hosting or any of that stuff.

2271
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:05,180
We got that covered because Jason's the man, but we just need help in writing.

2272
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:08,820
We just need a website that looks less- Yeah.

2273
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:09,860
Less.

2274
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:11,640
Our strength is radio, guys.

2275
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:13,580
That's the thing you got to learn.

2276
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:15,420
Radio is what we've done for seven years, not website design.

2277
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:19,300
Hey, I can update PHP BB, so don't worry about that.

2278
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:21,300
I did my own board.

2279
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:22,300
Awesome.

2280
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:29,260
That's- I'm going to give it a refresh just to see, but you know what?

2281
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:30,260
No.

2282
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:31,260
All right.

2283
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:32,260
That's all right.

2284
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:33,260
How dare they?

2285
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:38,340
Probably because I've been very behind on updating the podcast again, and you know,

2286
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:39,340
oops.

2287
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:44,780
I will resolve in the new year to get us all caught up and current again.

2288
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:46,740
So hooray.

2289
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:50,460
Let's move on with a couple more news stories, just a couple, and then we're going to do

2290
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:51,460
listless tonight.

2291
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:52,460
We haven't done listless in forever.

2292
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,420
This will be fun.

2293
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:56,420
Listless tonight.

2294
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:59,660
Top three news stories of 2008.

2295
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,460
Top three news stories will be tonight's listless.

2296
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:02,460
It'll be fun.

2297
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:05,140
It'll be quick, too, because there's only three of us, and then we've got Skype, too.

2298
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:06,140
Don't worry.

2299
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:07,140
We'll have Skype.

2300
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:09,140
We'll have plenty of time for that.

2301
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:10,820
Lucky news.

2302
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:11,880
Yes.

2303
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:18,300
So there was a game that was coming out, a RPG called Cryon that looked pretty cool.

2304
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:25,520
Unfortunately, the development company AQ Interactive that was behind it decided, well,

2305
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:32,220
they're just not going to release it because apparently due to the financial situation

2306
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:39,220
that they're in and that kind of stuff and their forecasts that they're going to not

2307
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:45,980
really continue development on it, the current market environment, and the forecasts for

2308
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:52,100
the future, and of course they apologized to everybody that was waiting for the release.

2309
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:53,100
But too bad.

2310
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:54,100
Yeah.

2311
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,100
I think this was a game that they were showing off.

2312
01:54:55,100 --> 01:55:01,980
I want to say either the very first year of 360 came out or maybe a little bit after.

2313
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:14,340
It's basically, what was it, a team that composed of Miss Walker and Artoon.

2314
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:16,020
What's Miss Walker been working on lately?

2315
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:18,500
Are they doing Lost Odyssey 2 and Blue Dragon 2?

2316
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:20,100
Well, there's a Blue Dragon DS game.

2317
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:21,100
Oh, yeah.

2318
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,100
That's right.

2319
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:23,980
I think there's some other Miss Walker game that's coming out.

2320
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:25,940
There were about a few things I remember.

2321
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:29,100
They've already confirmed a sequel to Lost Odyssey, though, right?

2322
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,100
I don't know.

2323
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:31,100
I think they did.

2324
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:32,100
I think they did.

2325
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:33,100
We'll see.

2326
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:34,100
Hey, follow up.

2327
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:36,500
Remember last week we just had depression upon depression?

2328
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:41,900
All these studios were closing left and right, and some of them were rumor status, and one

2329
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,700
of those was free radical.

2330
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:49,700
Unfortunately, it has been confirmed that as of December 31st, free radical is going

2331
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:52,540
to be downsizing significantly.

2332
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:56,260
Seventy-five percent of its workforce, 140 employees.

2333
01:55:56,260 --> 01:56:00,140
That means only 40 people will be left, and they're selling the business.

2334
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:05,300
There are some other companies out there that are apparently interested in picking up this

2335
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:11,160
company, but who knows who is going to snap up this company yet?

2336
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:12,420
But that's a bummer.

2337
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:18,380
140 employees get laid off right at the end of the year during the holidays.

2338
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:19,500
Damn this economy.

2339
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,180
Damn it.

2340
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:22,180
So there it is.

2341
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:25,540
The free radical is closing its doors.

2342
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:33,120
Well, just the countless news upon news articles of studios shutting their doors is just one

2343
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:37,460
of the big things that happened in 2008, but we thought we would take a look tonight at

2344
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:42,440
some of the top stories of 2008, the way that only we can do it here on Orange Lounge Radio

2345
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:48,580
in a segment we call Listless.

2346
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:49,580
That's right.

2347
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:55,860
On Orange Lounge Radio, we do a segment called Listless where we invite the host to submit

2348
01:56:55,860 --> 01:57:01,780
their top three, and then we have the chat room vote on the list that is prepared and

2349
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:07,500
come up with the ultimate list, and today's topic is the top three stories of 2008.

2350
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:11,340
Now what's interesting tonight is that I don't believe Bradley is going to be able to participate

2351
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:14,620
because I don't think he's been following enough stories this year to tell us he's shaking

2352
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:15,620
his head no.

2353
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:20,220
It's just dark soccer on myself and Loki to have lists out there, so because there's only

2354
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:24,340
so many of us participating tonight, there will be no elimination round in tonight's

2355
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:25,340
Listless.

2356
01:57:25,340 --> 01:57:29,580
So, it's an open table for anything you want to submit to the list tonight.

2357
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:32,700
And remember, you guys can use any criteria you want.

2358
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,560
That's part of what makes Orange Lounge Radio unique.

2359
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:41,500
We don't profess to be the experts or the analysts and all that crap.

2360
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:42,500
They get paid money.

2361
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:43,500
We don't.

2362
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,860
So we can use whatever criteria we want.

2363
01:57:44,860 --> 01:57:49,700
So that being said, dark soccer, biggest news story of 2008, number three, what would you

2364
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,700
say?

2365
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:55,220
The asshole getting smacked down.

2366
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:57,180
About fucking time.

2367
01:57:57,180 --> 01:58:01,180
He who shall not be named loses his license to practice law in Florida, correct?

2368
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:02,180
Yes.

2369
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:03,180
Alright.

2370
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:07,500
That was a pretty monumentous occasion that involved confetti being tossed and hurrays

2371
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:08,500
everywhere.

2372
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:09,500
Alright.

2373
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:12,260
DJ Dark Knight says, let the chatters kick one out.

2374
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:13,260
I don't know.

2375
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:16,540
Should we let the chatters maybe put, like, one thing on the list so we have a nice even

2376
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:17,540
ten?

2377
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:18,540
Sure.

2378
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:19,540
Alright.

2379
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:20,540
I'll do this.

2380
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:23,620
At a certain time, I'm going to open up the Skype line and we'll let you guys put one

2381
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:24,860
thing on the list.

2382
01:58:24,860 --> 01:58:25,860
Alright.

2383
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:28,740
Loki, you're number three.

2384
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:33,260
Oh man, that's tough.

2385
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:41,780
I guess because we talked a lot about it.

2386
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:45,740
I guess the, it'd be funny, Rock Revolution, not me announcing that they're doing Rock

2387
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:50,300
Revolution, or was that, no that was actually the year before last, or was that this E3?

2388
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:52,300
I can't remember.

2389
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:57,180
This E3 was the one where they really botched it publicly, you might remember, so maybe

2390
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:58,180
you want to use that.

2391
01:58:58,180 --> 01:58:59,180
Take that off.

2392
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:00,180
Take that off.

2393
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:01,180
Oh, no.

2394
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:02,180
I got it.

2395
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:07,700
Nintendo fucking up their E3 press conference.

2396
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:09,700
Care to elaborate?

2397
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:14,260
Yes, their demonstration of Wii music and how it butchered the Super Mario Brothers

2398
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:24,220
theme, stories about snowboarding and Sun's, I guess, holiday cards or stuff like that,

2399
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:28,980
and what was the other thing that they showed that was really crappy?

2400
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:31,620
Oh, Animal Crossing and how it wasn't different.

2401
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:35,420
Yeah, Game Guru in the chat room asked a question a lot of people are going to ask you.

2402
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:36,420
What fuck up?

2403
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:38,500
Some people would say they did not fuck up.

2404
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:42,420
Okay, disappointing showing at E3.

2405
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:44,500
Clearly they had the worst press conference.

2406
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:50,460
They were supposed to make this big splash to come back for ignoring the core gamer,

2407
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:54,620
and they ignored the core gamer, yeah.

2408
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:55,620
Alright.

2409
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:58,900
Alright, we said anything you want?

2410
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:01,020
Tiger Claus says, how about the drummer pretending to drum?

2411
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:04,100
So you do have some allies in your corner there.

2412
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:07,940
My number three that I would put on the list, I would say the story, and I don't know if

2413
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:11,500
you remember this, but part of the reason I'm putting it on the list is because of the

2414
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:16,180
endless lulls that it brought us on this show, but do you remember when a website called

2415
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:21,940
WhatTheyPlay.com ran a poll, and this poll discovered that people out there are more

2416
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:29,580
offended by sex and gay kissing than multiple uses of the word fuck and disembodied heads?

2417
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:34,940
Remember, gay kissing is more offensive than a severed head in a video game, so I believe

2418
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:41,260
that whole asshattery, we will call the WhatTheyPlay.com asshattery, even though I feel really terrible

2419
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:45,540
because I'm sure that website is like a fine website, it's just the users of that website

2420
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:54,060
are asshats, the WhatTheyPlay.com asshattery is my third top news story of 2008, because

2421
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:57,900
I think it really ties into a lot of these other types of censorship stories and even

2422
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:01,580
asshole losing his license and all that stuff, I think it all kind of ties together.

2423
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:06,660
It just really shows you the general public and how our views of the world can be very

2424
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:08,060
fucked up sometimes.

2425
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:09,060
Thank you.

2426
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:15,540
All right, that takes us to our number twos, Dark Saga.

2427
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:23,540
Number two will be Stephen Colbert and Rock Band.

2428
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:25,780
That was pretty epic to have Stephen Colbert and Rock Band.

2429
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:27,260
That was fucking epic.

2430
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:35,140
You can actually add Stephen Colbert and Jonathan Coulton in Rock Band.

2431
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:36,140
Have yourself a party.

2432
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:37,140
Hell yeah.

2433
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:42,460
All right, that's right, Charlene was available in Rock Band for free, so it's free Stephen

2434
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:43,940
Colbert and Rock Band.

2435
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:45,460
Yeah, even better.

2436
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:47,140
Twice as amazing.

2437
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:49,660
So we've got a free write-off of them, huh?

2438
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:53,140
And easiest way to get some of those achievements because the song is so short.

2439
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:55,340
Just want to point that out.

2440
02:01:55,340 --> 02:02:00,460
Loki, your number two top news story of 2008.

2441
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:03,780
Just because it was funny to make fun of how ridiculous everything was getting.

2442
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:06,260
The Little Big Planet controversy.

2443
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:13,180
Seriously, a song with lyrics that most people won't understand, can't possibly get offended

2444
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:14,180
by them.

2445
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,700
What was up with that?

2446
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:19,460
Like seriously, the guy had won Grammys and does this stuff all his time in his albums

2447
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:23,020
and nobody had ever had a problem with it before and even the guy who complained about

2448
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:28,620
it was like, I didn't mean to like recall the game, you could have just like patched

2449
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:29,620
it out.

2450
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:30,620
Panic!

2451
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:31,620
Panic!

2452
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:32,620
Panic!

2453
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:33,620
Panic!

2454
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:34,620
Panic!

2455
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:38,220
This is the new motto at Sony, whenever we talk about Sony headquarters, panic, panic,

2456
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:39,220
panic!

2457
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:40,220
Eat crayon, panic!

2458
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:43,620
That's right, the crayon eating leads to panicking.

2459
02:02:43,620 --> 02:02:48,540
Do you think that maybe there's some chemical in like the crayon that causes people to panic?

2460
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,540
Been dying there before.

2461
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:57,140
Alright, my number two was going to also be the news story about Nintendo burning their

2462
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:59,060
hardcore gamers at E3.

2463
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:08,180
But since Loki stole that, I will say the news that E for All got canned and old E3

2464
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:12,540
is coming back because I think it goes to show a lot of people said, it wouldn't work,

2465
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:17,500
it wouldn't work and as much as they're trying to say, well you know we tried something different

2466
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:23,820
and it didn't work, so old E3 is returning is my number two story of 2008.

2467
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:26,140
Old E3 returning, bye bye E for All.

2468
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:32,140
Where did E for All not work out, do you guys think, everything?

2469
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:38,300
I think that it was a good concept but because there was already this expectation of what

2470
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:46,940
was there before, it really did rub raw with a lot in the community and really I think

2471
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:55,220
a lot of the hype was really really brought up at the big E3 orgy, I'm sorry it was the

2472
02:03:55,220 --> 02:04:00,780
orgy of game, so that really actually cut down a lot of advertising for them I thought.

2473
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:05,660
They had a Target booth where you could buy games, oh my god, where will we find a Target

2474
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:11,900
on, I don't know, anywhere in the United States, oh wait no they're everywhere that's right,

2475
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:16,540
so yes of course you need to go to E for All to go buy your games.

2476
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:22,380
Gangru wants to point out in chat that Capcom he believes was the worst at E3, at least

2477
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:27,820
Nintendo talked about actual games, that was a good point, Capcom got up there and sucked

2478
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:34,900
their own dicks for an hour basically is what they did, which you think would be an impressive

2479
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:37,140
thing to watch but in fact it was really boring.

2480
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:42,100
It would be like if I went to an old folks home and talked about how awesome games are,

2481
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:46,820
they would probably boo me off the stage and go to sleep.

2482
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:51,060
Same thing was happening with the casual game stuff, I know that a lot of people like casual

2483
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:56,220
games, which is great, but casual gamers don't really need to be up to date on what's coming

2484
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:58,580
out because they're casual gamers.

2485
02:04:58,580 --> 02:05:03,260
They don't care about street dates, they don't care about having to play stuff right away,

2486
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:07,500
they're casual, they're like hey cool, this game's awesome, it just came out, maybe I'll

2487
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:09,140
give it a shot.

2488
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:16,300
I don't know, it's just the core audience is what drives the consoles and you have to

2489
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:22,540
appease the core audience and then get some more people in to become your core audience.

2490
02:05:22,540 --> 02:05:25,300
Gameguru says E3 is for the casual gamer and movie lover now.

2491
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:29,140
I don't know, do you think having to go back to the old way somewhat, I mean we say the

2492
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:32,580
old way although they say we're going to cap it at 40,000, they say they're going to make

2493
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:38,060
it easier for podcasters to get in and I'm saying I'll believe it when I see it.

2494
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:51,740
My podcasters, if you're an IGN podcaster, or people that do an incredible job at marketing

2495
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:55,660
their podcasts, there's people out there that do a much better job at marketing themselves

2496
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:57,460
and their hobby than we do, honestly.

2497
02:05:57,460 --> 02:06:01,180
This is something we've done for LoLs on a Sunday night for seven years, but some people

2498
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:04,740
have really made a life out of it out there in the indie podcasting community, so I'm

2499
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:07,060
not knocking that, props to them.

2500
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:11,780
Do what you love, but I think they'll have an easier time getting into E3, but we will

2501
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:15,620
still have to ask for handouts on the street corner.

2502
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:20,860
All right, I promised that we would allow a listener to add something to the list, so

2503
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:22,260
we're going to the Skype line right now.

2504
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:23,260
Who's on the line?

2505
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:24,260
This is Aki Ripper.

2506
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:25,260
Aki Ripper!

2507
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:28,260
How are you doing, my friend?

2508
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:29,860
I'm doing just fine.

2509
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:30,860
All right.

2510
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:36,300
With the small, tiny detail that what the hell do I have to add to this, LoL?

2511
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:40,900
Well, you got through.

2512
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:45,300
You called when I said to call in chat, and I said a chat room person could add one item

2513
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:46,300
to the list.

2514
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:48,340
So we are about to start our number ones.

2515
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:52,940
So Aki Ripper, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?

2516
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:54,540
Any criteria you want.

2517
02:06:54,540 --> 02:07:03,260
Well, the only thing I can think of at the straight really is the dissemination of who

2518
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:05,660
dare, that one who shall not be named.

2519
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:08,780
So I fail, but automatic.

2520
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:09,780
Sorry.

2521
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:11,500
Well, yeah, and that's already on the list.

2522
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:13,860
So you're not going to try and add something new to the list?

2523
02:07:13,860 --> 02:07:19,580
What would number two be?

2524
02:07:19,580 --> 02:07:20,780
I really got to be.

2525
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:24,660
I am so really behind.

2526
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:25,660
Gua!

2527
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:29,200
Pardon me, I just failed.

2528
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:33,580
Was there a game called Gua that was released this year?

2529
02:07:33,580 --> 02:07:34,580
Guar is a band.

2530
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,580
I know that.

2531
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:39,140
All right, Aki Ripper, I'll have to let you go.

2532
02:07:39,140 --> 02:07:40,340
Call back later.

2533
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:41,340
Later.

2534
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:43,380
All right.

2535
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:44,380
People so excited to call in.

2536
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:45,980
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2537
02:07:45,980 --> 02:07:46,980
Who's this?

2538
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:47,980
Hey, it's Jason.

2539
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:48,980
Guess what, Jason?

2540
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:52,660
I turned on my volume and was like, wait, is that me?

2541
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:57,140
The call before you, Jason, tried to name something that was already on the list because

2542
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:58,140
of the delay.

2543
02:07:58,140 --> 02:07:59,140
Yeah, who shall not be named.

2544
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:00,260
That's what I was just trying to turn down.

2545
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:03,420
I know, because they're in a foreign country and all.

2546
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:06,540
It takes like an hour for the delay and everything, yet they were able to call in.

2547
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:11,860
No, but I reminded them that it didn't, okay, sorry, technical difficulties.

2548
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:12,860
That's right.

2549
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:13,860
Jason, that's good news for you.

2550
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:15,980
That means you can put on whatever you want onto the list.

2551
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:20,300
So what do you think was the top news story of 2008 in gaming?

2552
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:24,060
I'm going to be a little bit egotistical with this one because of how everything went out.

2553
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:28,420
The new Metal Gear Solid will be an iPhone game.

2554
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:31,700
Oh, something a little recently here.

2555
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:32,700
Okay.

2556
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:34,180
Jason, I think this is such a big freaking deal.

2557
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:38,820
Give me one moment so I'm not echoing all over the place.

2558
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:41,260
You sound fine to us here in the studio, just so you know.

2559
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:42,620
Yeah, you said that, but...

2560
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:46,380
You sound like a tin can, but you sound fine.

2561
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:51,540
I chose that simply for the fact that people went absolutely crazy about Metal Gear Solid

2562
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:53,380
5, holy crap.

2563
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:54,980
We've already gotten portable ops.

2564
02:08:54,980 --> 02:08:58,980
We've already gotten, what was it, Metal Gear Acid, am I even thinking about the right

2565
02:08:58,980 --> 02:08:59,980
game?

2566
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:01,680
We've already got portable games, we've already got offshoots.

2567
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:05,940
Before it just came out and they were really trying to end the series, the eye and the

2568
02:09:05,940 --> 02:09:12,900
logo just prime over-analytical-ness, that's what I mean.

2569
02:09:12,900 --> 02:09:17,060
Well, you know what's interesting is it's not just Metal Gear that Konami is putting

2570
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:18,060
on the phone.

2571
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:21,540
If I recall, they also announced DDR and some of their other big franchises on iPhones.

2572
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:26,760
So to me, this is more of a story about that iPhone is starting to legitimately become

2573
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:30,220
a gaming platform of sorts, as much to Loki's dismay.

2574
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:33,340
Yeah, Konami Mobile, yeah, that sounds about right.

2575
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:37,260
Yeah, but they already had cell phone games, so that's a gamey, I'm sorry.

2576
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:41,740
Well, not Metal Gear, hence my real reliance right on that.

2577
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:45,980
Yeah, but this isn't really a good Metal Gear game anyways.

2578
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:50,940
Some interesting comments in chat, Bob Coffee says, Metal Gear Touch will fail.

2579
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:53,860
Pitstun says, Metal Gear Touch is a glorified light gun game.

2580
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:57,240
Game Guru says, Metal Gear Solid Touch should be on Wii.

2581
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:58,860
So should the Silent Hill arcade game.

2582
02:09:58,860 --> 02:10:00,340
That should be on Wii.

2583
02:10:00,340 --> 02:10:03,580
All right, well, Jason, thank you so much for contributing to the list.

2584
02:10:03,580 --> 02:10:06,380
And we'll see what happens if the chat room votes it as one of the top three.

2585
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:07,900
Hell yeah, you guys better.

2586
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:08,900
All right, we'll see.

2587
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:09,900
Bye.

2588
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:10,900
Thanks.

2589
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:15,460
All right, let's go around and get our in-studio, our number one picks for biggest news story

2590
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:16,460
of 2008.

2591
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:20,100
Dark Sakura, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?

2592
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:21,180
The biggest news story?

2593
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:24,460
I'd actually say our pair of anniversaries.

2594
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:25,460
How so?

2595
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:27,460
For the station, seriously.

2596
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:30,140
No, really.

2597
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:31,220
Any criteria you want.

2598
02:10:31,220 --> 02:10:38,920
It's really big for us because we not only hit 300 episodes, but we hit six years.

2599
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:46,920
So I'd say that's fairly monumental that, you know, we're that bored.

2600
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:52,300
You know, and I don't know if there is another, and if I am mistaken, please feel free to

2601
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:57,440
correct me, but I don't think there is another show that runs weekly that has hit 300 episodes

2602
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:01,020
in the history of the internet, of gaming.

2603
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:02,460
If there is, please let me know.

2604
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:03,460
And again, that's weekly.

2605
02:11:03,460 --> 02:11:06,740
I know there's some that ran daily that were able to hit 300 episodes, but I don't know

2606
02:11:06,740 --> 02:11:10,140
if any of them ran weekly because in order to hit 300 episodes, you would have to have

2607
02:11:10,140 --> 02:11:11,460
run for six years.

2608
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:12,460
Trust us, we know.

2609
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:13,460
Six and a half years.

2610
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:17,620
Six and a half years, yeah, at this point because we take a week off once in a while.

2611
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:21,340
So there you go.

2612
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:25,660
By the way, major props to a Dark Sakura for her delivery of We're That Bored.

2613
02:11:25,660 --> 02:11:27,660
Alright.

2614
02:11:27,660 --> 02:11:28,980
Hey.

2615
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:29,980
It's so true, though.

2616
02:11:29,980 --> 02:11:34,740
Alright, no, you know, we do it because, you know, what else would we do?

2617
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:35,740
Crack?

2618
02:11:35,740 --> 02:11:36,740
Uh, Loki!

2619
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:38,740
Well, since that was going to be my number one.

2620
02:11:38,740 --> 02:11:39,740
Winners don't use drugs.

2621
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:43,580
But that was going to be my number one because I did dress up like, uh, Sackboy then.

2622
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:45,820
That was going to be your number one?

2623
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:46,820
Really?

2624
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:49,180
My God, you're getting Capcom on me.

2625
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:50,900
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, listen.

2626
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:55,140
I have a better number one, though, because this small event happened.

2627
02:11:55,140 --> 02:12:01,960
In May of 2008, Activision announced that Guitar Hero, which became Guitar Hero World

2628
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:05,820
Tour, would now have drums.

2629
02:12:05,820 --> 02:12:07,300
And would now be copying Rock Band.

2630
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:15,220
It would be the first music game in the history of music games to have drums and guitars in

2631
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:16,220
the same game.

2632
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:18,700
Oh, wait, except that's inaccurate.

2633
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:22,900
But that's what they said, or something like that.

2634
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:28,260
Meaning like how, uh, they got up there, I think, and said, like, this is the first time

2635
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:31,540
you're going to be able to get to play the guitar and play the drums and sing at the

2636
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:33,620
same time, all in one game.

2637
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:36,700
And everybody's just thinking, like, uh, lol, Rock Band.

2638
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:40,700
Well, I think they meant in the Guitar Hero series, but yeah, yeah.

2639
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:44,060
But you know, you know how them suits are.

2640
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:47,340
They like to think that we're all ignorant, which is not true.

2641
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:48,340
So.

2642
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:54,340
All right, uh, my number one, I mean, I decided to pick something I actually think is the

2643
02:12:54,340 --> 02:13:00,140
number one thing that happened this year in gaming, like huge news, I think, that changes

2644
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:02,180
gaming in a big, big way.

2645
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:05,340
And uh, do you guys remember I've been talking about something that I said was going to be

2646
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:06,460
huge for gaming?

2647
02:13:06,460 --> 02:13:09,780
It was announced early in the year and then happened, and I'm saying it's going to be

2648
02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:11,980
like the YouTube of the 360.

2649
02:13:11,980 --> 02:13:12,980
Sing Star Abba?

2650
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:16,700
No, not Sing Star Abba!

2651
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:20,620
Community games on the new Xbox experience, the fact that they brought in community games,

2652
02:13:20,620 --> 02:13:23,020
not just that, but Netflix.

2653
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:26,500
So I'm going to kind of loop it all in and say the new Xbox experience, I think, is the

2654
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:30,940
biggest new story of 2008 because it brought us not just the community games and the, you

2655
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:36,860
know, web 2.0 age of my 360, but the fact that I can freaking stream movies to my 360.

2656
02:13:36,860 --> 02:13:39,940
That just bumped up its entertainment capacity by a ton.

2657
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:40,940
You know what I mean?

2658
02:13:40,940 --> 02:13:47,380
It's not a gaming system, but a movie hub, you know, an entertainment system, really.

2659
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:53,660
So uh, new, uh, NXC is my number one story of 2008.

2660
02:13:53,660 --> 02:13:58,100
But I want to specifically state it's because of community games and Netflix and not necessarily

2661
02:13:58,100 --> 02:14:01,540
because of stuff that was just to kind of catch up to other companies like the Avatars

2662
02:14:01,540 --> 02:14:05,180
and you know, there are some things about NXC I don't like, but I do think those two

2663
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:08,620
particular aspects make it very, very relevant.

2664
02:14:08,620 --> 02:14:12,260
Sorry, I know, you would think Sing Star Abba would be there.

2665
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:15,340
Maybe if I got to do a top five, I don't know.

2666
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:17,420
All right.

2667
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:20,700
So since we're skipping an elimination round this time, you guys get to vote on this as

2668
02:14:20,700 --> 02:14:21,700
it is right here.

2669
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:25,260
I'm going to post this in the chat room there and you can send in your votes.

2670
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:27,300
Prepare for floodage in chat.

2671
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:32,460
All right, so you can place a vote for your number one and your number two picks in the

2672
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:34,460
chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

2673
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:36,340
These were the top ones.

2674
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:38,740
Jack Thompson getting the beat down.

2675
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:42,380
Nintendo fucks up the E3 press conference, as Loki said, fucked up.

2676
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:44,940
WhatTheyPlay.com ass hattery.

2677
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:47,100
Stephen Colbert is in rock band.

2678
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:50,020
Little Big Planet Karan lyrics and the controversy.

2679
02:14:50,020 --> 02:14:51,900
Notice that's Karan, not Korean.

2680
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:55,580
Old E3 is coming back, buy E for All.

2681
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:57,340
Metal Gear goes to iPhone.

2682
02:14:57,340 --> 02:15:00,200
OLR hits 300 episodes in six years.

2683
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:03,460
I love how that's mixed in with all these other stories.

2684
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:05,640
Guitar Hero announces drums.

2685
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:08,700
And edXE community game and Netflix.

2686
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:09,780
So there you have it.

2687
02:15:09,780 --> 02:15:15,500
Send your number one and number two picks via private message to Sky in the chat room.

2688
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:18,780
While you do that, we have some more news for you guys and we'll get to the results

2689
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:19,780
shortly.

2690
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:20,780
Please hurry and get those in.

2691
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:22,900
Loki, we'll start off with you.

2692
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:23,900
Yes.

2693
02:15:23,900 --> 02:15:30,740
Speaking of games with guitars and drums, Rock Band 2 for the Wii is finally going to

2694
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:34,620
get some download content starting in early 2009.

2695
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:39,420
They're going to be, I guess, adding that feature to it as well.

2696
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:45,140
And they're going to start with the content that was originally available.

2697
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:50,140
I think the free 20 song pack or whatever.

2698
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:52,860
So that'll be interesting.

2699
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:55,060
Oh, that's cool.

2700
02:15:55,060 --> 02:16:02,680
Yeah, free 20 song pack, I guess, that was available already and then the free 30 download

2701
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:07,380
tracks from the original Rock Band download content library.

2702
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:08,380
Huh.

2703
02:16:08,380 --> 02:16:09,780
Very cool.

2704
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:12,860
So free songs for the people that bought Rock Band.

2705
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:14,660
That's right, because the Wii people have to wait for a while.

2706
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:18,340
Well, actually, no, I guess not because it just came out like last week or so.

2707
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:21,740
So that wouldn't be too bad.

2708
02:16:21,740 --> 02:16:24,780
It's nice to see, though, that there's actual download content for some of these games.

2709
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:27,860
I mean, because if you think about it, they haven't really done it.

2710
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:31,380
I'm surprised, like even Animal Crossing or something, they haven't seen any really download

2711
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:32,380
content.

2712
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:36,260
I'm very surprised about that as well, considering, you know, how Nintendo is.

2713
02:16:36,260 --> 02:16:37,300
You know what I mean?

2714
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:41,720
There's like no download content for any Nintendo stuff.

2715
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:48,100
No new tracks in Mario Kart, no new characters in Smash Brothers, no new music in Wii Music.

2716
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:50,180
Nothing.

2717
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:51,180
Very surprised.

2718
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:52,180
Me, too.

2719
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:53,180
I am very surprised.

2720
02:16:53,180 --> 02:16:55,780
I'm very curious to see how the download content's going to work.

2721
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:57,140
That is going to be very interesting.

2722
02:16:57,140 --> 02:16:59,100
Very, very interesting.

2723
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:00,820
All right.

2724
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:02,620
More stories, yes?

2725
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:04,220
There is.

2726
02:17:04,220 --> 02:17:11,940
Actually, this is pretty cool that for Rock Band, they're actually getting some new content.

2727
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:17,940
They're actually getting Roy Orbison.

2728
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:21,180
How's that for cool?

2729
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:22,180
Who's Roy Orbison?

2730
02:17:22,180 --> 02:17:24,220
It seems kind of random to me.

2731
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:31,340
Well, this is actually reported by CMT, but they're actually putting in a pack of Roy

2732
02:17:31,340 --> 02:17:37,980
Orbison songs that are going to be on Rock Band 2.

2733
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:38,980
They would know.

2734
02:17:38,980 --> 02:17:41,660
Didn't he do You Got It?

2735
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:42,960
Yeah.

2736
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:45,180
They would know because CMT is owned by MTV.

2737
02:17:45,180 --> 02:17:46,180
He sang Pretty Woman.

2738
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:47,180
Yeah, he did.

2739
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:48,180
Yeah.

2740
02:17:48,180 --> 02:17:49,180
Pretty Woman.

2741
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:50,180
That's probably the song that's going to be there.

2742
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:51,180
Just you wait.

2743
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:52,620
Roy Orbison's cool.

2744
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:56,260
Plus he was with the Traveling Wilburys, and that was pretty cool.

2745
02:17:56,260 --> 02:18:04,860
Well, Guitar Hero's going to be getting some more free download tracks in the form of two

2746
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:06,940
Bruce Springsteen tracks.

2747
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:15,260
Apparently, let's see, I guess, Born to Run and My Lucky Day.

2748
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:21,940
I guess My Lucky Day's office new single, and Born to Run, of course, is a classic track.

2749
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:28,140
Those will be available on both the PSN and Xbox Live Marketplace January 27th through

2750
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:29,140
February 4th.

2751
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:30,140
All right.

2752
02:18:30,140 --> 02:18:37,900
We're going to be opening up the Skype line and taking your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2753
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:40,940
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2754
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:43,660
You can go ahead and give us a call, and we'll take a couple of your calls.

2755
02:18:43,660 --> 02:18:47,980
Meanwhile, do we have any last minute stories here while I try to tally up the last of the

2756
02:18:47,980 --> 02:18:52,220
Cage Match votes, too?

2757
02:18:52,220 --> 02:18:53,220
No.

2758
02:18:53,220 --> 02:18:55,220
Yeah, it really wasn't a very busy week, was it?

2759
02:18:55,220 --> 02:18:58,260
In other news, Jamie wants a cookie.

2760
02:18:58,260 --> 02:18:59,940
There are cookies, actually, here in studio.

2761
02:18:59,940 --> 02:19:00,940
I know.

2762
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:04,280
See, you left them here, and I was going to eat them all, but then I thought, what a good

2763
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:11,980
idea to keep cookies in studio on hand for those moments when Jamie says, I need a cookie.

2764
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:16,220
That's not going to actually happen after the beginning of the year, Rob.

2765
02:19:16,220 --> 02:19:17,980
Why are you going on a diet?

2766
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:19,140
I don't go on diets.

2767
02:19:19,140 --> 02:19:20,140
Are you going on a lifestyle adjustment?

2768
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:23,460
I adjust my lifestyle, and that's not exactly what I'm doing.

2769
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:24,460
I'm readjusting.

2770
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:26,980
Won't there be a type of cookie you can still eat?

2771
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:27,980
Fiber.

2772
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,980
All right.

2773
02:19:28,980 --> 02:19:29,980
Fiber cookies.

2774
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:30,980
All right.

2775
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:31,980
Fiberglass cookies.

2776
02:19:31,980 --> 02:19:32,980
Holy cookies.

2777
02:19:32,980 --> 02:19:33,980
All right.

2778
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:35,100
If you hear a crackling noise, it's because I picked up a call like a minute ago, and

2779
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:36,100
the poor guy's having to wait.

2780
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:37,100
Hi.

2781
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:38,100
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2782
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:39,100
Who's this?

2783
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:40,100
It's GSXPA, and no aesthetic.

2784
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:41,580
I am not ordering a pizza for OLR.

2785
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:42,580
Yeah.

2786
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:44,940
Please don't order pizzas to the studio if you know where we live.

2787
02:19:44,940 --> 02:19:46,420
That's not nice.

2788
02:19:46,420 --> 02:19:47,980
GSXPA, what's on your mind?

2789
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:52,340
Now, I think I know what's on your mind, because you live in a certain part of the Bay Area

2790
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:55,620
where you got something special this week, right?

2791
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:56,620
Yeah.

2792
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:58,580
DJ Max Technica at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

2793
02:19:58,580 --> 02:20:02,500
Tell us about DJ Max Technica at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

2794
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:03,500
What's it like?

2795
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:04,500
Yeah.

2796
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:09,340
Basically, it's kind of like Elite Beat Agents meets Luminous.

2797
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:10,660
You have two halves of the screen.

2798
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:15,020
You have this line going from one side of the screen to the other, and then there's

2799
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:16,020
these markers.

2800
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:20,380
You have to press it as the line goes over them.

2801
02:20:20,380 --> 02:20:24,900
And it's kind of like big meaning that as you press the markers, you recreate parts

2802
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:27,900
of the music.

2803
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:29,900
Yeah.

2804
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:30,900
But will it blend?

2805
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:31,900
No.

2806
02:20:31,900 --> 02:20:32,900
Is it fun?

2807
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:33,900
That's what I want to know.

2808
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:34,900
Is it fun?

2809
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:35,900
Yeah.

2810
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:36,900
Did you have fun with it?

2811
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:37,900
It's pretty fun.

2812
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:45,780
On the first day, we had 20 people in line, so between journeys, I had to wait 20 games,

2813
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:47,220
which wasn't really a problem for me.

2814
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:49,020
I just played other games between rounds.

2815
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:50,020
My God.

2816
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:53,500
Isn't that like a three-hour wait, 20 games, or at least an hour?

2817
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:58,740
Well, the problem is the life meter on the game is very harsh.

2818
02:20:58,740 --> 02:21:05,140
If you miss seven to 10 notes in a row, you automatically fail, and it's not like say

2819
02:21:05,140 --> 02:21:10,220
popping music, where if you fail the first stage, you get to go to the next.

2820
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:15,740
Plus, on the final stage, the difficulty for the progression from one stage to the next

2821
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:16,740
is really harsh.

2822
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:21,020
On the first stage, you can pick a level one song, but on the second, the lowest you can

2823
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:24,740
pick is level three, I think, and for the final stage, the lowest you can pick is a

2824
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:25,740
level five.

2825
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:31,380
So by Thursday, you have songs that initially you have a lot of trouble with, and you end

2826
02:21:31,380 --> 02:21:35,220
up failing within the first 30 seconds.

2827
02:21:35,220 --> 02:21:38,900
All right, so I got to turn this call around real quick, though, and address another topic

2828
02:21:38,900 --> 02:21:42,300
that we brought up earlier in the show, because as neat as this game sounds and all, I've

2829
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:48,140
got to know your thoughts on, because I know you're a DJ Maxx fan, the whole Konami lawsuit,

2830
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:49,340
and don't just say it's bullshit.

2831
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:52,300
I'm just curious, like, what are your thoughts?

2832
02:21:52,300 --> 02:21:58,580
Well, and you know that Konami sued Rockstar for In the Groove and won, right?

2833
02:21:58,580 --> 02:21:59,580
Sure, yeah.

2834
02:21:59,580 --> 02:22:03,660
Well, I mean, personally, I think the whole In the Groove thing had it coming, because

2835
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:07,980
it was basically DDR, just with different music and charts, like, some modifiers.

2836
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:14,460
DJ Maxx, I have different opinions for, because at least it seems to be different from Beat

2837
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:15,460
Mania.

2838
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:21,620
Like, for example, DJ Maxx's portable that, I mean, Konami hasn't really done a portable

2839
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:22,620
2DX.

2840
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:27,260
I mean, yeah, there's the Game Boy Beat Minis, but for money here, those aren't really good,

2841
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:28,740
and they weren't very popular.

2842
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:38,660
Whereas with DJ Maxx's portable here, it was so successful that it actually became its

2843
02:22:38,660 --> 02:22:45,660
own series, and so we just want to have mixed feelings about this lawsuit.

2844
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:55,300
I mean, yeah, DJ Maxx is a lot like Beat Mania, but at the same time, I don't know if Panda

2845
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:59,380
Vision really deserved this, I mean...

2846
02:22:59,380 --> 02:23:03,380
You know, I gotta say, though, you get us thinking about something, I gotta say, you

2847
02:23:03,380 --> 02:23:06,420
have a well-thought-out point, because you got me thinking about something I didn't think

2848
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:14,100
about before, because, like, I kind of agree with you that the reason why In the Groove

2849
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:17,500
got the beat down, I know a lot of people are pissed off about the whole In the Groove

2850
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:21,100
lawsuit and everything, but let's face it, In the Groove was DDR, okay?

2851
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:26,260
Like it was, like, really, really, really the same thing, okay?

2852
02:23:26,260 --> 02:23:30,220
But you're right, they haven't really put out, Konami has not really put out a portable

2853
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:34,300
version of their game, and I don't even know if you can really count those Game Boy Beat

2854
02:23:34,300 --> 02:23:37,860
Mania games, because they were so long ago, they were on a completely different system,

2855
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:40,340
they just weren't even the same as the PSP.

2856
02:23:40,340 --> 02:23:42,380
That is kind of an interesting point.

2857
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:44,620
Anyone in the studio think that changes things at all?

2858
02:23:44,620 --> 02:23:45,620
No.

2859
02:23:45,620 --> 02:23:46,620
No?

2860
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:47,620
Why not?

2861
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:52,180
I mean, just because they, I don't think they're gonna put out a portable DDR, it just

2862
02:23:52,180 --> 02:24:01,420
doesn't make any sense, because the PSP right now, I guess it could be used as, you know,

2863
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:02,900
you could play DDR on it.

2864
02:24:02,900 --> 02:24:07,140
Well, kind of like that StepMania thing for PSP, right?

2865
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:08,140
That's what I was saying.

2866
02:24:08,140 --> 02:24:12,060
Yeah, you can't play DDR on it, but a lot of people would be like, what's the point?

2867
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:15,780
I mean, thank you, what is the point, I never understood the point of DDR on a portable

2868
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:16,780
platform.

2869
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:22,540
Well, on the go, I mean, sometimes you can't, sometimes you don't have gaming on the go,

2870
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:26,220
or you can't take your pad and such with you.

2871
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:30,940
But here's the thing, though, is, before I remember talking to a Konami rep one time

2872
02:24:30,940 --> 02:24:35,180
about if, when they were planning on bringing over Guitar Freaks, and this was like a long

2873
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:41,460
time ago, and they're like, well, unfortunately they don't know how to, you know, they don't

2874
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:47,940
know how to market a guitar game for the US, you know, whereas like a DJing game, oh, people

2875
02:24:47,940 --> 02:24:51,460
want to play, you know, DJing games, which I think would be totally opposite, you know,

2876
02:24:51,460 --> 02:24:54,060
who wouldn't want to be in like a rock band or something like that.

2877
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:59,900
But that's the thing, is, if they have trouble figuring out how to market a guitar game,

2878
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:05,100
you know, which is kind of a no-brainer nowadays, what makes people think, you know, what, I

2879
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:10,300
don't think that they would think that a DDR game on a PSP would be a good idea, because

2880
02:25:10,300 --> 02:25:14,420
they can't go, oh, you can get exorcised, no you can't, because you're just playing

2881
02:25:14,420 --> 02:25:19,980
a little PSP game, but, I don't know, it would be kind of cool maybe like a BeatMania game

2882
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:20,980
or something like that.

2883
02:25:20,980 --> 02:25:21,980
Yeah, right.

2884
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:27,340
Yeah, there was a pump and a DMR on the PSP, but that also, but that tanked, as far as

2885
02:25:27,340 --> 02:25:29,380
I'm concerned.

2886
02:25:29,380 --> 02:25:31,060
Because what is the fucking point?

2887
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:36,300
I mean, really, beating Groovy on the PSP, I don't know, maybe.

2888
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:39,500
Oh, yes, beating Groovy, oh gosh.

2889
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:44,540
I mean, beating Groovy had a lot of potential, I mean, I can understand why it's only five

2890
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:51,060
buttons, but, I mean, whoever was behind beating Groovy just handled it really poorly, I mean,

2891
02:25:51,060 --> 02:25:56,300
the songs are too easy, they went out of their way to replace all the awesome pop and music

2892
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:58,300
characters, and...

2893
02:25:58,300 --> 02:26:04,200
God, you are so right, that's what's so frustrating about beating Groovy, is that beating Groovy

2894
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:08,020
did have a lot of potential to be a really awesome game, and, oh wait, they already have

2895
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:12,420
that game, it's called pop and music, and it's, like, superior in every way, and it's

2896
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:13,420
just insulting.

2897
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:18,620
Like, what Konami did with beating Groovy is insulting to us people that have been supporting

2898
02:26:18,620 --> 02:26:19,620
them for so many years.

2899
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:21,740
I'm sorry, there's really no other way to describe it.

2900
02:26:21,740 --> 02:26:25,820
Well, I mean, I can understand the rationale behind the five button mode, but, like, the

2901
02:26:25,820 --> 02:26:30,580
lack of song listening and such, I mean, hell, look at the US version of BeatMania, that

2902
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:37,860
had, like, at least 30 songs ranging from really easy to really hard, and, aside from

2903
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:43,620
that five key beat medium mode, I mean, did it, and the new difficulty system, and the

2904
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:49,300
gray system, which, isn't that really big of a deal, I mean, at least it's pretty faithful,

2905
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:54,940
like, as far as the basics go, whereas beating Groovy, like, what the fuck is this?

2906
02:26:54,940 --> 02:26:58,340
Alright, uh, GSCCA, we're gonna let you go, so we can get some more calls, but thank you

2907
02:26:58,340 --> 02:27:02,900
for the review of, uh, DJMaxx, uh, Technica, and, uh, I definitely will be going to the

2908
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:05,060
Bay Area at some point to check it out, I promise.

2909
02:27:05,060 --> 02:27:06,060
Let me know.

2910
02:27:06,060 --> 02:27:09,820
As soon as next weekend, I, I have, uh, stuff going on in South Bay next weekend anyway,

2911
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:10,820
I might swing by.

2912
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:11,820
Alright.

2913
02:27:11,820 --> 02:27:12,820
I don't know, though.

2914
02:27:12,820 --> 02:27:16,540
I'm living on Twitter, I have, I have free time all next week anyways.

2915
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:19,760
The problem is, I have to take my female friend with me who thinks video games are stupid,

2916
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:22,260
so I don't know how I'm gonna entertain her, but we'll think of something.

2917
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:23,260
Oh, alright then.

2918
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:24,260
Alright.

2919
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:25,260
Alright, see ya.

2920
02:27:25,260 --> 02:27:26,260
Bye.

2921
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:29,420
Alright, yeah, you know, I think I've made it no secret on the show, I do Rocky Horror

2922
02:27:29,420 --> 02:27:33,820
Picture Show still in the Bay, and I do stuff on stage and stuff, um, and I'm, I'm signed

2923
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:38,940
up to this show in the South Bay next week, so I'll probably go, but, um, yeah, my friend

2924
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:41,180
that goes with me doesn't, doesn't get the video game thing.

2925
02:27:41,180 --> 02:27:43,380
Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2926
02:27:43,380 --> 02:27:47,020
I have returned to spam up the airwaves even more.

2927
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:49,260
Please do, Jason, what's on your mind?

2928
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:51,460
Yes, I, I wanted to talk about something earlier.

2929
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:55,580
I don't even remember what it was, but something else just hit me, so I'll kill time with that.

2930
02:27:55,580 --> 02:27:56,580
Sure.

2931
02:27:56,580 --> 02:28:01,060
Is it just me, or was this a year of classical throwbacks?

2932
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:05,260
Well, yeah, look at, look at what game topped our list.

2933
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:09,620
I mean, if we didn't put anything on the list, Mega Man 9 would have won amongst the listeners,

2934
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:10,620
hands down.

2935
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:11,620
Hands down.

2936
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:16,540
That's a pretty good definitive pick, and that is what I mean, it's, uh, I was basically

2937
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:21,120
just going to elaborate and say, sure, years back, Nintendo has resold their whole catalog,

2938
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:22,120
but that doesn't mean anything.

2939
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:26,300
This is the year of Mega Man 9, Braid, and I had another example.

2940
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:32,060
Is it gaming, or is it Capcom, because, you know, the biggest ones I think of, Mega Man

2941
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:38,700
9, Bionic Commando Rearmed, which was pretty damn impressive, and, uh, Super Street Fighter,

2942
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:43,620
Turbo HD, Remix, Super, Uber, I can't believe I paid $10 for this version.

2943
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:47,420
The movie, the game, anniversary, third style?

2944
02:28:47,420 --> 02:28:49,420
Yes.

2945
02:28:49,420 --> 02:28:54,260
I mean, Capcom was one of the biggest offenders, quote unquote, in this category, but at the

2946
02:28:54,260 --> 02:28:58,220
same time, I think Capcom finally started doing the games this year, but we wanted them

2947
02:28:58,220 --> 02:29:04,220
to do these downloadable games when they first came out, in a way.

2948
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:09,420
But also, you know, a game like LittleBigPlanet, what's the first thing people do in LittleBigPlanet's

2949
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:10,420
level creator?

2950
02:29:10,420 --> 02:29:13,980
Remake World 1-1 for Mario Brothers, yes, make Mario a LittleBigPlanet.

2951
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:15,900
I was going to say porn.

2952
02:29:15,900 --> 02:29:17,500
Or porn, but you know what I mean?

2953
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:18,620
They'll make the cock level.

2954
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:24,300
A large majority of those levels are, you know, remakes of other games from another

2955
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:26,400
day, in this newer engine.

2956
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:30,180
So there definitely is a big retro vibe going on in 08.

2957
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:34,060
I don't know if you guys have gone back and actually watched it, or actually looked for

2958
02:29:34,060 --> 02:29:38,220
it, but you remember the Gradius level that the Japanese guy made?

2959
02:29:38,220 --> 02:29:39,220
Yes.

2960
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:41,260
Everybody was talking about.

2961
02:29:41,260 --> 02:29:46,120
Just in case I just referred to it by name, the level name was Libidus.jp.

2962
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:49,700
He has made SuperLibidus.jp.

2963
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:52,140
It is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up.

2964
02:29:52,140 --> 02:29:54,540
Oh, I'm going to have to check his levels.

2965
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:58,620
I haven't looked at a while, but that guy did some amazing shit in LittleBigPlanet.

2966
02:29:58,620 --> 02:30:04,380
It's interesting because he has, yeah he did, all of the beatmania type level, and no, not

2967
02:30:04,380 --> 02:30:05,380
a math level.

2968
02:30:05,380 --> 02:30:06,380
Anyways.

2969
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:11,460
There was another new one, I think it was supposed to be based off some Japanese shooter,

2970
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:12,740
but I didn't understand it.

2971
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:18,300
But now that they've given an actual paint gun, I'm curious to see what he does next.

2972
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:19,300
You know what I mean?

2973
02:30:19,300 --> 02:30:21,680
All the shots are just hard anymore now that you have the paint gun.

2974
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:25,560
That's a huge extra mechanic they've put in the game.

2975
02:30:25,560 --> 02:30:30,300
The only thing that I don't like about this SuperLibidus is that at the same time it adds

2976
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:37,700
a very interesting twist, but if you're getting shot at, and you shoot that bullet, the two

2977
02:30:37,700 --> 02:30:42,560
bullets bounce off and fly in the other direction, and fly in opposite directions.

2978
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:44,380
And like I said, it's a vertical scroller.

2979
02:30:44,380 --> 02:30:49,380
He has this, if you think of really, really old vertical shoot-em-ups, he has a crosshair

2980
02:30:49,380 --> 02:30:53,460
that's not even a quarter of the way up the screen permanently fixed right in front of

2981
02:30:53,460 --> 02:30:55,060
your ship.

2982
02:30:55,060 --> 02:31:00,100
There are ground quote-unquote enemies shooting at you that you can't destroy.

2983
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:01,100
What was that game?

2984
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:04,900
There was a game on the NES that had that, was it Xanax, Xevious?

2985
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:07,060
You had that crosshair permanently fixed.

2986
02:31:07,060 --> 02:31:09,060
You might be thinking Zaxxon.

2987
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:10,060
No not Zaxxon.

2988
02:31:10,060 --> 02:31:11,060
It was Xevious.

2989
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:12,860
It was Xevious with the little blue landers.

2990
02:31:12,860 --> 02:31:13,860
Was it Xevious?

2991
02:31:13,860 --> 02:31:14,860
I think so.

2992
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:16,260
Because that target showed you where the bombs would drop.

2993
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:17,260
Yeah.

2994
02:31:17,260 --> 02:31:18,260
Yeah, that's what it was.

2995
02:31:18,260 --> 02:31:19,260
That's pretty sure.

2996
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:23,260
If you were describing it, I thought it was Xevious.

2997
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:26,500
There might be a bomb button that I just haven't found yet.

2998
02:31:26,500 --> 02:31:31,220
Just like Libidus, I died very quickly and sucked really hard.

2999
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:33,220
Nice.

3000
02:31:33,220 --> 02:31:37,680
And it made me laugh a lot, because when you lose the level, just like in Libidus, you have

3001
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:43,140
a little halfpipe with all of your orbs, depending on how far you got, but there's a key in there.

3002
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:46,100
And when you do it and leave the level, guess what you get?

3003
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:47,500
A new level with a key?

3004
02:31:47,500 --> 02:31:49,360
Super Libidus easy mode!

3005
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:52,540
You fail so hard, you get a key just like in Devil May Cry.

3006
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:53,540
Nice.

3007
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:57,340
I got to cry all over again at the worst insult a game could ever hand me.

3008
02:31:57,340 --> 02:31:59,140
I really need to get in there and make a level.

3009
02:31:59,140 --> 02:32:01,480
I need to tear myself away from WoW long enough, Jason.

3010
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:04,680
How do I do it?

3011
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:05,680
Close your laptop.

3012
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:10,000
No, you play on desktops, what am I thinking?

3013
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,140
Kick the monitor.

3014
02:32:12,140 --> 02:32:13,140
Break it.

3015
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:14,140
I don't know.

3016
02:32:14,140 --> 02:32:16,140
If I break the monitor, then I don't have one for the show.

3017
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:20,420
Being the fact that I've never been much of a WoW person, I can't offer, an MMO person

3018
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:21,980
rather, I can't really offer much advice.

3019
02:32:21,980 --> 02:32:22,980
That's all right.

3020
02:32:22,980 --> 02:32:23,980
I'll get to it someday.

3021
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:26,580
I do have a lot of fun when I play a little bit of Planet, I'll get to a level at some

3022
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:27,580
point.

3023
02:32:27,580 --> 02:32:29,740
All right, well, Jason, we're going to let you go to try and get a couple more calls,

3024
02:32:29,740 --> 02:32:33,420
and we have to read the list list results and see if you're suggesting me the top three.

3025
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:38,380
You guys have better voted me in, at least number two, I can respect a certain one for

3026
02:32:38,380 --> 02:32:39,380
number one.

3027
02:32:39,380 --> 02:32:40,380
We're about to find out in two seconds.

3028
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:41,380
All right, see you, Jason.

3029
02:32:41,380 --> 02:32:42,380
All right, folks.

3030
02:32:42,380 --> 02:32:52,620
Our fearless webmaster, Jason, VXJsonXV, Jason for short.

3031
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:55,060
Let's talk about the winners, shall we, of list list.

3032
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:57,220
Don't worry, we'll get back to the phone and do a couple more calls.

3033
02:32:57,220 --> 02:33:01,260
Let's get to the top three based on your votes.

3034
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:06,380
Hold on, I have to add it up here so I don't read it wrong.

3035
02:33:06,380 --> 02:33:09,700
Okay, there is definitely a very definitive top three tonight.

3036
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:11,380
No ties, no nothing.

3037
02:33:11,380 --> 02:33:13,540
Very easy top three spelled out here tonight.

3038
02:33:13,540 --> 02:33:16,780
The number three top news story of 2008.

3039
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:20,300
Actually, I'm curious.

3040
02:33:20,300 --> 02:33:24,420
Folks here in studio, provided you didn't look over my shoulder, any predictions on

3041
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:26,860
what they thought was the number one story of 2008?

3042
02:33:26,860 --> 02:33:27,860
Cookie.

3043
02:33:27,860 --> 02:33:28,860
Cookie.

3044
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:30,860
I don't think that was on the list, DarkSucker.

3045
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:37,860
I'd say either our 300th episode just because they're kissing ass, or guitar hero.

3046
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:38,860
All right.

3047
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:39,860
Bradley?

3048
02:33:39,860 --> 02:33:40,860
Any thoughts?

3049
02:33:40,860 --> 02:33:41,860
No?

3050
02:33:41,860 --> 02:33:42,860
Or.

3051
02:33:42,860 --> 02:33:43,860
Or.

3052
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:44,860
All right, let's see.

3053
02:33:44,860 --> 02:33:45,860
Let's see.

3054
02:33:45,860 --> 02:33:50,260
All right, the number three biggest story of 2008.

3055
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:51,260
This is definitive.

3056
02:33:51,260 --> 02:33:52,260
This is absolute.

3057
02:33:52,260 --> 02:33:53,260
There is no arguing.

3058
02:33:53,260 --> 02:33:55,540
This is a flawless process.

3059
02:33:55,540 --> 02:34:00,380
Jack Thompson getting the beat down was the number three pick for the biggest story of

3060
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:01,380
2008.

3061
02:34:01,380 --> 02:34:02,380
Oh, I'm sorry.

3062
02:34:02,380 --> 02:34:03,380
I said his name out loud.

3063
02:34:03,380 --> 02:34:04,380
That just gives him power.

3064
02:34:04,380 --> 02:34:05,380
Sorry.

3065
02:34:05,380 --> 02:34:07,500
Oh, but not in the state of Florida.

3066
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:12,340
The number two biggest story of 2008 in gaming.

3067
02:34:12,340 --> 02:34:16,340
The new Xbox experience brings us community games and Netflix.

3068
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:18,540
There you go.

3069
02:34:18,540 --> 02:34:25,300
And lastly, the top story of 2008, the biggest story in gaming.

3070
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:32,260
Orange Lounge Radio hits 300 episodes in six years, you narcissistic bastards.

3071
02:34:32,260 --> 02:34:35,900
Hey, it is monumental.

3072
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:43,220
Like I said, we are that full of ourselves.

3073
02:34:43,220 --> 02:34:47,900
I just love that the chat, you know, it just goes to show our live listeners and the podcast

3074
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:53,020
listeners too, the whole family here at OLR, everybody that helps make this show a success.

3075
02:34:53,020 --> 02:35:00,580
Everybody has to spank their monkey that sometimes everybody contributes to that in one way or

3076
02:35:00,580 --> 02:35:01,580
another.

3077
02:35:01,580 --> 02:35:02,580
All right.

3078
02:35:02,580 --> 02:35:05,820
Oh, Jason's going apeshit in the chat room and not letting people talk because they didn't

3079
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:09,260
vote his as a top three.

3080
02:35:09,260 --> 02:35:12,620
I will say though, Jason, yours to get some votes.

3081
02:35:12,620 --> 02:35:17,580
It would have come in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

3082
02:35:17,580 --> 02:35:18,580
No sixth.

3083
02:35:18,580 --> 02:35:25,860
It would have come in sixth out of the list, so there you go, Jason.

3084
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:26,860
Very rude.

3085
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:27,940
All right.

3086
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:30,700
It's rude to silence those who disagree with you.

3087
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:32,700
All right.

3088
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:36,500
Let's do another call.

3089
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:41,480
Orange Lounge Radio's username on Skype, 1877 game OLR is the number to call.

3090
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:44,120
We'll do like one more call then we will wrap up.

3091
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:46,340
For live listeners, no afterbirth tonight.

3092
02:35:46,340 --> 02:35:47,340
Sorry, guys.

3093
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:50,500
We have a late start, so we have jobs to get to tomorrow.

3094
02:35:50,500 --> 02:35:57,140
We're already well after midnight on the East Coast, so we're not going to do an afterbirth

3095
02:35:57,140 --> 02:36:00,540
tonight, but do stay tuned because I do have a special message for you after the show just

3096
02:36:00,540 --> 02:36:01,540
for the live folks.

3097
02:36:01,540 --> 02:36:03,020
Let's get to one more call.

3098
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:04,020
Hi.

3099
02:36:04,020 --> 02:36:05,020
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3100
02:36:05,020 --> 02:36:06,020
Who's this?

3101
02:36:06,020 --> 02:36:07,020
You know, Legend of Zaku.

3102
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:08,020
Legend of Zaku.

3103
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:10,820
What's on your mind?

3104
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:11,820
Nothing much.

3105
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:17,220
Just gloating, just looking back at what was once this year and in the next few days we'll

3106
02:36:17,220 --> 02:36:18,620
be the next year.

3107
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:19,620
Yeah.

3108
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:23,180
This year has gone by really fast.

3109
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:24,740
Shit happened really quickly.

3110
02:36:24,740 --> 02:36:27,640
What do you think of the list of the biggest stories of 2008?

3111
02:36:27,640 --> 02:36:30,620
Was there something else you would have put on that?

3112
02:36:30,620 --> 02:36:34,020
I guess it was pretty much concise of what happened.

3113
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:38,540
Guess Jack Thompson's disbarring should have been up there pretty high.

3114
02:36:38,540 --> 02:36:43,740
I wouldn't say number one, but it should have been an honorable mention at least.

3115
02:36:43,740 --> 02:36:49,180
With all respect to Dark Sakura and for putting that on the list originally, in my world,

3116
02:36:49,180 --> 02:36:50,900
I hate talking about him.

3117
02:36:50,900 --> 02:36:51,900
Totally.

3118
02:36:51,900 --> 02:36:52,900
I don't want that anymore.

3119
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:56,580
I don't like that being anywhere near the top stories just because I feel like the more

3120
02:36:56,580 --> 02:36:58,780
we talk about him, the more strength he gains.

3121
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:01,100
But he has no strength to begin with.

3122
02:37:01,100 --> 02:37:03,460
He has no legal power anymore.

3123
02:37:03,460 --> 02:37:05,900
True, true, but he just sucks.

3124
02:37:05,900 --> 02:37:09,140
There's still a story about him this week and I didn't even know he would have been

3125
02:37:09,140 --> 02:37:10,140
there.

3126
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:11,140
Don't go away.

3127
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:12,140
Yeah, he won't.

3128
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:13,140
Make it stop.

3129
02:37:13,140 --> 02:37:14,740
People will keep talking about him.

3130
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:17,780
Game politics, I'm looking at you, yeah?

3131
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:19,540
Keep talking about him.

3132
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:27,700
Besides that, obviously Final Fantasy 13 on the 360, that was the biggest.

3133
02:37:27,700 --> 02:37:32,380
That right there would have been the big summer surprise right there.

3134
02:37:32,380 --> 02:37:35,320
Funny how quickly we all forgot about that one, huh?

3135
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:38,740
I think for me though, the reason why that missed my list is that's something I've kind

3136
02:37:38,740 --> 02:37:43,620
of come to expect at this point in the year, is that most things are on all the platforms

3137
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:44,620
now.

3138
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:47,100
I mean, you've kind of heard, I think Capcom.

3139
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:49,260
It was unprecedented when it was announced.

3140
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:54,900
It was almost like jaw-dropping that it came out of nowhere.

3141
02:37:54,900 --> 02:37:58,340
I think at some point during this year, Capcom came out and said, look, the only way we're

3142
02:37:58,340 --> 02:38:02,220
going to make our money back is to put our games out on all the platforms.

3143
02:38:02,220 --> 02:38:07,660
And ever since then, in my opinion, this news has not been as shocking.

3144
02:38:07,660 --> 02:38:08,660
But that's just me.

3145
02:38:08,660 --> 02:38:17,540
When Square dropped that bombshell over E3, that was a critical blow to the PS3's exclusivity.

3146
02:38:17,540 --> 02:38:23,100
The only thing they have now is Metal Gear Solid 4 and first-party exclusives.

3147
02:38:23,100 --> 02:38:28,840
So it pretty much gives people less of a reason to get a PS3 in the first place, since there's

3148
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:36,700
no big-ticket games exclusive for their system, aside from the ones made by Sony themselves.

3149
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:43,260
So it's like, why should I get Final Fantasy 13 when I could get it for my 360 easily and

3150
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:47,300
rack up on the achievements and whatever other features they may have?

3151
02:38:47,300 --> 02:38:48,580
Because the controller sucks?

3152
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:49,580
I don't know.

3153
02:38:49,580 --> 02:38:53,140
But yeah, you see the argument I'm trying to make, right?

3154
02:38:53,140 --> 02:38:54,140
No, I do.

3155
02:38:54,140 --> 02:38:55,140
I do.

3156
02:38:55,140 --> 02:38:56,140
It was huge.

3157
02:38:56,140 --> 02:38:57,140
It was huge.

3158
02:38:57,140 --> 02:38:58,140
And Hitstun agrees with you in chat.

3159
02:38:58,140 --> 02:39:02,060
The FF13 announcement was the top story of the year, no doubt.

3160
02:39:02,060 --> 02:39:10,900
Where I could pull it off in terms of making that 360 version on the same level as the

3161
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:20,220
PS3, then they'll be raking in shitloads of money because of the tens of millions of users

3162
02:39:20,220 --> 02:39:23,520
that make up the 360's install base.

3163
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:31,100
So it's like, in that way, they see a bigger picture in terms of how much money they're

3164
02:39:31,100 --> 02:39:32,820
willing to make.

3165
02:39:32,820 --> 02:39:36,180
Everything else, every loyalty be damned.

3166
02:39:36,180 --> 02:39:37,180
Yeah.

3167
02:39:37,180 --> 02:39:41,980
All right, well, Zaku, any other quick thoughts before I let you go and try to wrap up the

3168
02:39:41,980 --> 02:39:42,980
show?

3169
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:49,420
Steam and their sale this week, please, please get Bioshock for five bucks.

3170
02:39:49,420 --> 02:39:50,860
You won't be disappointed.

3171
02:39:50,860 --> 02:39:56,140
Might as well go to Steam right now and just get your cheap-ass games.

3172
02:39:56,140 --> 02:39:57,140
All right.

3173
02:39:57,140 --> 02:39:58,460
I know all of us have the ability.

3174
02:39:58,460 --> 02:39:59,460
Let's go.

3175
02:39:59,460 --> 02:40:00,460
All right.

3176
02:40:00,460 --> 02:40:02,900
Let's go for Bioshock here before we close out the Skypline.

3177
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:04,700
Zaku, have a good one.

3178
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:05,700
Have a good one.

3179
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:07,860
Have a good, you know, new year.

3180
02:40:07,860 --> 02:40:08,860
Happy new year.

3181
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:09,860
Mm-hmm.

3182
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:10,860
All right.

3183
02:40:10,860 --> 02:40:18,460
All right, we are going to try to wrap it up here and close up shop for the night.

3184
02:40:18,460 --> 02:40:21,980
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

3185
02:40:21,980 --> 02:40:26,140
Remember, hey, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about Orange Lounge

3186
02:40:26,140 --> 02:40:31,420
Radio because word of mouth is really the biggest way for us to spread word about the

3187
02:40:31,420 --> 02:40:32,420
show.

3188
02:40:32,420 --> 02:40:35,180
So we would really, really appreciate that.

3189
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:37,420
All right.

3190
02:40:37,420 --> 02:40:39,860
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3191
02:40:39,860 --> 02:40:44,060
DarkSakura, your final thought for this last OLR of 2008.

3192
02:40:44,060 --> 02:40:45,060
Reject false icons.

3193
02:40:45,060 --> 02:40:46,060
Mm, well said.

3194
02:40:46,060 --> 02:40:50,900
Loki, PayPal is awesome to dump these stupid little gift cards that I have left with like

3195
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:54,940
five dollars on each one of them and I can't really spend them in one place.

3196
02:40:54,940 --> 02:40:56,900
It says donate the money to myself.

3197
02:40:56,900 --> 02:40:57,900
Nice.

3198
02:40:57,900 --> 02:40:59,900
How did you donate money to yourself?

3199
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:05,660
I created a donate link for myself and paid a credit card.

3200
02:41:05,660 --> 02:41:06,660
Nice.

3201
02:41:06,660 --> 02:41:13,300
Arkadian42, Bradley, whatever your name is, what, no, thank you for being here.

3202
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:16,540
And what is your final thought?

3203
02:41:16,540 --> 02:41:19,780
My new year's resolution to play the games I bought this year.

3204
02:41:19,780 --> 02:41:20,780
All right.

3205
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:24,140
Me too.

3206
02:41:24,140 --> 02:41:27,460
My final thought for this, the last show of 2008.

3207
02:41:27,460 --> 02:41:33,620
Kids, your pancreas is a much more important organ than you might have thought before.

3208
02:41:33,620 --> 02:41:34,620
Just so you know.

3209
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:35,620
All right.

3210
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:37,900
That's going to do it.

3211
02:41:37,900 --> 02:41:41,140
Thank you guys once again for supporting us throughout 2008.

3212
02:41:41,140 --> 02:41:43,340
Will you come back and do it again in 2009?

3213
02:41:43,340 --> 02:41:44,340
Maybe.

3214
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:45,340
Sure.

3215
02:41:45,340 --> 02:41:46,340
What the hell.

3216
02:41:46,340 --> 02:41:47,340
All right.

3217
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:48,340
See you next year.

3218
02:41:48,340 --> 02:41:49,340
