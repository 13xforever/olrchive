00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:22,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I, December 28, 2008, Capulorasa goes free, Konami files another music game lawsuit, and we look back at the highlights.

2
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:33,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Merry Christmas, everybody!

3
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:35,134
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too late for that.

4
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:35,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, whoops.

5
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:37,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, just a preemptive one for 2009.

6
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:39,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you're listening to... It's still Kwanzaa!

7
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:40,415
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.

8
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Merry Kwanzaa, everybody!

9
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:43,976

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,805

13
00:00:58,845 --> 00:00:59,866
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Rob Roberts.

14
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Joining us as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sad, Rob.

16
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are you sad?

17
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:07,394
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the last show of the year.

18
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:11,065
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

19
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:31,498
[SPEAKER_13]: We were just kind of chilling and it kept going and going.

20
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:32,598
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were like, oh, let's take a cat nap.

21
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:34,359
[SPEAKER_10]: I fell into a Indian food coma.

22
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,360
[SPEAKER_13]: But then our chat room was getting restless.

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,441
[SPEAKER_13]: As they might say overseas, rude.

24
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,441
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit rude.

25
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:47,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Better rude than Randy What about Loki?

26
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:07,976
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to talk to you anyways.

27
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:10,697
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure he'd make his presence known at some point anyway.

28
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:12,418
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't gone into the gaming weeks yet.

29
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,181
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'd gone into gaming weeks and still forgot Loki, then you could yell at me.

30
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:24,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, don't you know that the first rule of parenting is maintain a schedule and an order?

31
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I your daddy?

32
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:28,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, baby.

33
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:34,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Also say hello to the one and only Arcadian42 is joining us tonight.

34
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Straight from the ultra-sensitive mics.

35
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:40,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the ultra-sensitive mic.

36
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:42,517
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to come and bother you for a show.

37
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:43,438
[SPEAKER_13]: No, please do.

38
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,439
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it was funny.

39
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a bunch of people sending me private messages before the show began tonight.

40
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:48,362
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:14,255
[SPEAKER_12]: We've decided, though, what your special power is.

42
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:15,776
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the ability to show up at any party and still be there.

43
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Playing pinball.

44
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Just sit in the corner and use... Is that... Don't notice me until... No, it's like... Oh, he's over there.

45
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,342
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's like... And we have no problem with this.

46
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:44,043
[SPEAKER_10]: We just think it's funny.

47
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:47,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan and I were talking about last time you were at one of our parties.

48
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:56,169
[SPEAKER_10]: and we were just wandering around the house and people were starting to head off and nothing's going on in the garage, at least so we think.

49
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:59,091
[SPEAKER_10]: We go into the garage and there he is playing.

50
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:01,673
[SPEAKER_13]: You're turning the light out and you hear this voice.

51
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:02,734
[SPEAKER_10]: It was about to.

52
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:10,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of a sudden I hear like sound effects from, oh God, what machines do we have in there right now?

53
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:11,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Indiana Jones?

54
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,100
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we were fixing that one.

55
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,862
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was just hearing sound effects.

56
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:16,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, what the crap?

57
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:16,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hi.

58
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:16,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

59
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nowhere to go.

60
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:45,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, TinyRob.

61
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:49,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's go to... Hey, it's not the size, it's how you use it.

62
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:51,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get into your gaming week.

63
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,584
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

64
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:55,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Semi-eventful.

65
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:57,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I played stuff.

66
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I started Ragnarok Online DS.

67
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:02,720
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, ooh, Ragnarok!

68
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking.

69
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:09,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, I read like a Japanese five-year-old.

70
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Talking and talking and talking and talking and talking.

71
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, action!

72
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:15,833
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna fall off a cliff!

73
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:18,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit, we landed on this guy!

74
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk to him!

75
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Talk to me!

76
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:48,754
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I forgot his name, but like, I was like, text in blue, I can read it!

77
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:50,435
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was named one of the towns.

78
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:51,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, okay, good.

79
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:55,937
[SPEAKER_10]: All the towns are gonna be written in katakana, and I can read that shit!

80
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:57,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I know where to go!

81
00:05:58,178 --> 00:06:04,521
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and it was, it actually, when it goes through big dialogue scenes, it has you saved periodically.

82
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:07,722
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I've saved, and I've done my stats too.

83
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:14,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I at least remember that all my stats are in the same place, because I recognize the kanji for strength.

84
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:17,046
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I was like, well, strength is always the first one.

85
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:21,528
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe the next one is agility, and the next one is intelligence, and blah, blah, blah, blah.

86
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:21,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

87
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:22,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Simon's Quest

88
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,771
[SPEAKER_10]: What a horrible night for a curse.

89
00:06:53,152 --> 00:07:03,158
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, so anyway, so anyway, I also, I went with my friend Becky and we got her husband an Xbox 360, well she did that technically.

90
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:10,102
[SPEAKER_10]: She got the family their Christmas present of an Xbox 360 and she gave him a Big Fat Gift Certificate to GameStop.

91
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:19,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, well, if you were going to actually pick out games for him, you should get him Fallout 3 and Fable 2 and the Orange Box.

92
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,809
[SPEAKER_10]: So guess what he picked up with his gift certificate?

93
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,430
[SPEAKER_13]: All of them.

94
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:23,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

95
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:24,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

96
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:26,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell yeah.

97
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:28,376
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, so it was funny.

98
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:31,298
[SPEAKER_10]: So I actually got to see some of Fallout 3, and I thought it was pretty cool.

99
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't play any, because those games make me freaking nauseated as hell.

100
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:36,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you get to hit the button that makes the baby talk?

101
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:37,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, that's the one thing.

102
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:47,790
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really played Fallout 3 yet, but I was listening to Bobby talk about it on the last show, when they were talking about the, I don't remember what it was, but he was talking about slamming on the button that makes the baby talk, and I'm like, wow, that sounds kind of awesome.

103
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,651
[SPEAKER_13]: That could be the best game ever.

104
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:49,512
[SPEAKER_10]: He was already past it.

105
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:50,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

106
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:55,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played some Animal Crossing so that I could harass Jingle, who I think is on crack.

107
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh shit, I forgot about holidays in Animal Crossing.

108
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:03,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he has the starry eyes, and I think that it really means that Jingle is on crack so he won't sleep at all that night.

109
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:06,962
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like, here's your presents, kids!

110
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:11,864
[SPEAKER_10]: And I downloaded something on my phone.

111
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:12,704
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?

112
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:13,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, two things.

113
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:19,853
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all was the 8,000 cocktail drink mixing guide for free.

114
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:27,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, we're having our New Year's party at Julie's house and I need to be drunk because it's Julie's house.

115
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:30,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

116
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,278
[SPEAKER_13]: No offense to Julie if you listen.

117
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:34,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Intoxicated enough to actually sing karaoke.

118
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,299
[SPEAKER_13]: I see.

119
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:37,880
[SPEAKER_10]: We will have special guests.

120
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,070
[SPEAKER_10]: who will be here for this party, namely Sauce.

121
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, is she coming to town?

122
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:50,853
[SPEAKER_10]: No, she's actually going to teleport in and show up just for five seconds that night and leave.

123
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:52,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, she's coming.

124
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,634
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I think I'll see you at Gaming Week before I smack you.

125
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:57,815
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play other stuff.

126
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Riding Rock Online.

127
00:08:59,155 --> 00:08:59,596
[SPEAKER_10]: The real thing.

128
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:00,076
[SPEAKER_10]: The real one.

129
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:01,736
[SPEAKER_10]: The real one for free.

130
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:09,359
[SPEAKER_10]: And someone gave me a mistress card for Christmas and I was like, ooh, mistress card.

131
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that like a business card?

132
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,962
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Mistress is the stupid bee that I hate.

133
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:26,227
[SPEAKER_10]: She's one of the MVP things and then you get a card that makes you not have to use gems to cast stuff which is helpful and useful.

134
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:28,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Only I forgot to put it in something.

135
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:36,012
[SPEAKER_10]: So I got that and I played with the City of Heroes character creator a lot.

136
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:37,013
[SPEAKER_10]: The Korean one.

137
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:38,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the best part of the game.

138
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:41,295
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I have the Korean character creators.

139
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:42,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have the whole game yet.

140
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:43,556
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm thinking about playing it.

141
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking about playing it.

142
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:47,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I was really thinking about it.

143
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:51,360
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, dude, why would I even remotely want to play World of Warcraft again?

144
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I was just like looking at different stuff.

145
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:55,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, dude, I don't want to play it anymore.

146
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:58,143
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm kind of waffling again.

147
00:09:58,283 --> 00:10:03,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's really it for my gaming week.

148
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:04,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me read some chat comments.

149
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:09,727
[SPEAKER_13]: You can always join our chat room, chat.orangelongeradio.com, and we always like to read your comments throughout the program.

150
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:29,552
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68 comments on both you and I have said things about the level of difficulty in the Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game, and I don't know if it's just because we suck at games now that we've gotten older or the game really is kind of a step harder, but GS68's thought is at least Ecclesia is think on your feet hard, not stupid hard like Circle of the Moon.

151
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:36,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, this is what I've noticed is I've actually got pretty good reaction time through the forest.

152
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:40,391
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just I sped through the first level.

153
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:42,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I really just sped through it.

154
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:44,618
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that

155
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I would probably do better with about another level's worth of life, and then I can get through it.

156
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:55,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's like this one place that I always end up getting smacked around at.

157
00:10:55,694 --> 00:11:06,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Since you didn't get your time, gaining experience points, so... So I'm going to go back and... And we have an offer from Xenocor in chat, who's on the Justice server in City of Heroes, if you ever need help.

158
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:07,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you kindly, sir.

159
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,582
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

160
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:10,923
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

161
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:12,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I played...

162
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:21,305
[SPEAKER_03]: More this idea of the new Final Fantasy, I don't even know if you want to call it a fighting game.

163
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:25,011
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's very similar to Crisis Core a bit.

164
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Crisis Core, if you've ever played it, is...

165
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:29,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

166
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:46,449
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

167
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:15,044
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

168
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:35,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's okay, I guess.

169
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:37,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of bored with it.

170
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:40,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried making a character look like myself, and then that didn't work.

171
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:43,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next best thing was I made a creepy Santa Claus.

172
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:54,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to, you know, first I was just trying to find clothes that looked like the Santa Claus clothes, and then I realized that they actually sold the Santa Claus clothes, so I had to buy those.

173
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:58,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, wait, wait, stop, hold on.

174
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,411
[SPEAKER_13]: You bought something at home?

175
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:01,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

176
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:02,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Get off the show.

177
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,236
[SPEAKER_13]: I am laughing you off of this program you spent money on that

178
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,268
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

179
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:46,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing about it is, I had knocked the PlayStation Network before because I hated the way you put money on your account and you have to spend so much.

180
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:57,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I found out, if you are buying items that are under $5, then yes, you can only put in the minimum of $5 on your account.

181
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:03,540
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're purchasing stuff over $5 in total, what will happen is, say if you have like

182
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I played around with Home for a little bit and it was a complete waste of time.

183
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:07,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get

184
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,407
[SPEAKER_03]: What the purpose of all this is.

185
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:37,068
[SPEAKER_13]: But at least you look like Santa Claus.

186
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:37,708
[SPEAKER_13]: So hooray for that.

187
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:39,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, at least I look like Santa Claus.

188
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:41,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, big deal.

189
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:44,351
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to still wear the Santa Claus costume forever.

190
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,211
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not buying any more clothes.

191
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:46,591
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

192
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:47,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Santa Claus forever now.

193
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Even in June.

194
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:49,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in June.

195
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:50,333
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

196
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:53,334
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it was quite boring.

197
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:54,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And the loading is annoying.

198
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:59,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got to say some comments from chat because they're too good.

199
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Hanukkah Harry in chat says, What the fuck, Loki?

200
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:03,177
[SPEAKER_13]: You might as well buy Eye of Judgment.

201
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:05,506
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not buying that.

202
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:06,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I have judgment.

203
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:10,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Trishlicious in chat says, I wish I had a PlayStation 3, then I could be exploring home now.

204
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, Trish, I used to feel that same way like six months ago.

205
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:16,513
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not missing much, honestly.

206
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:17,574
[SPEAKER_13]: It's still in beta.

207
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:18,055
[SPEAKER_13]: It's early.

208
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:21,797
[SPEAKER_13]: I think home's going to be a lot better in a year, but that'll be a year.

209
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:23,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have to give them credit, though.

210
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:30,123
[SPEAKER_03]: The video integration in it, like the actual little video screens and stuff, that's actually pretty cool, and it's pretty seamless.

211
00:15:30,523 --> 00:15:30,623
Yeah.

212
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:33,364
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, it's kind of annoying.

213
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:38,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also annoying how much stuff is being censored in there.

214
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, everything's being censored, and it's really annoying.

215
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:43,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so enough with home.

216
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:49,276
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I downloaded on the PlayStation Network this week was the new Metal Gear Solid pack for LittleBigPlanet.

217
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:51,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And holy crap, does that change the game.

218
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:57,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It really, first of all, the pack itself contains like five levels, and I think a challenge level.

219
00:15:58,522 --> 00:15:59,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're great levels.

220
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:04,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's the same kind of quality as the in-game story levels, and they're awesome.

221
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:08,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it, though, because the whole premise of the levels is that you're...

222
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:16,369
[SPEAKER_03]: basically going to try to stop Liquid's device for creating trophy levels.

223
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,431
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a machine that creates trophy levels.

224
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:19,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Genius.

225
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:19,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Pure genius.

226
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:24,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the way that Media Molecule played on some of the current controversies.

227
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:27,057
[SPEAKER_13]: The only thing that would have been even better was a joke about moderation.

228
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:28,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Somehow.

229
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:32,562
[SPEAKER_13]: But I love that they actually made fun of the whole trophy whoring levels.

230
00:16:32,682 --> 00:16:33,943
[SPEAKER_13]: That was great.

231
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:38,066
[SPEAKER_03]: But the actual new weapon, like the Paininator in it,

232
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:39,565
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

233
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:09,726
[SPEAKER_03]: and unless they hit a roadblock of something that they really want to add that they can't do in LittleBigPlanet, then they'll do a LittleBigPlanet 2.

234
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:14,089
[SPEAKER_03]: But for right now, they're just going to keep doing download packs because they're selling really well.

235
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

236
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:24,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Now just to clarify though, you don't have to buy this Metal Gear Solid add-on to get to use the Paintinator because it'll show up in other people's levels, right?

237
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:25,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that's right.

238
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:26,057
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of neat.

239
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

240
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:50,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing some more of the levels on there.

241
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:51,753
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really cool.

242
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,053
[SPEAKER_03]: The paint there is fun.

243
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:58,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone actually made a level that was like a tank that had three different weapons and stuff on there.

244
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,814
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of neat.

245
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:04,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the stuff that they do in the Metal Gear Solid levels are just amazing.

246
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:13,937
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have one level that you have to sneak and avoid these spotlights because if not, then you die because all these explosions come.

247
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,177
[SPEAKER_03]: The last boss in the game...

248
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:17,398
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

249
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Arcadian42, Bradley Surd, the chatty one tonight.

250
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:48,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw you haul a DS in here and you were kind of playing DS while we had a little bit of downtime a little bit ago.

251
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,845
[SPEAKER_13]: What kind of games have you been playing this week?

252
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:56,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of this week I was not playing anything because I was at home on the other coast doing Christmas stuff.

253
00:18:57,188 --> 00:19:00,229
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I've been playing recently is My Japanese Coach.

254
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:01,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, where is home?

255
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:03,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we might have some listeners there that want to go, Woo!

256
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:05,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Greenville, South Carolina.

257
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:05,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Woo!

258
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:06,272
Alright.

259
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,777
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

260
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:22,346
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

261
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:44,025
[SPEAKER_12]: and they were going back to England for a week for someone's funeral or something.

262
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,786
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of fun to listen to them.

263
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:54,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I don't mean to laugh, but I'm just trying to picture what must have been so fascinating about this conversation.

264
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:55,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Never mind.

265
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:56,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Another show.

266
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:58,218
[SPEAKER_13]: My Japanese coach.

267
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:06,345
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm basically reviewing what I've learned before for the most part and learning a little bit enough to get through that.

268
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:31,514
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's actually pretty good for learning new stuff and I think there's maybe the only limitation if you're like a newer user would be or a newer person learning Japanese would be that it kind of glosses a little bit over the learning sentences and so on but it's good on like repetition of words and so on which is if you're just reviewing the first like the first 30 or 40 lessons it's

269
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:38,638
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit tedious because it takes a while because you have to repeat games and stuff to get to the next lesson.

270
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:40,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you actually have to talk into it?

271
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,563
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you don't have to talk.

272
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:44,945
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a thing you can actually compare.

273
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:52,693
[SPEAKER_12]: You can speak into the mic and then you don't repeat it back and you can kind of compare it to the actual Japanese speaker that's in the game.

274
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:55,503
[SPEAKER_12]: so that you can learn that stuff.

275
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:56,184
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds neat.

276
00:20:56,204 --> 00:21:06,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think somebody like me who doesn't know a lick of Japanese yet tries to pronounce the Japanese release dates here on Orange Lodge Radio and gets teased for it every other week, do you think I might have some benefit to play this game?

277
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:08,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it would be pretty good.

278
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:09,236
[SPEAKER_12]: I might have to check it out.

279
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:12,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and then you can learn the Hiragana and Katakana and

280
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:13,823
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, it takes a long time.

281
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,565
[SPEAKER_12]: The economy is not until like less than 40 or something.

282
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:20,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Although Jamie did admit a few weeks ago, I've gotten better in the years I've been doing it.

283
00:21:20,328 --> 00:21:21,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Your past got quite a bit better.

284
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:21,929
[SPEAKER_13]: I've gotten better.

285
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:24,010
[SPEAKER_13]: So when in doubt, crash and burn your way through it.

286
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:25,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Arigato.

287
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:32,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because basically when I've been listening to the podcast, trying to catch up, which I'm still like 30 behind.

288
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:34,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually thinking about getting that though.

289
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:35,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh man, come on, you could say that better.

290
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:36,499
[SPEAKER_12]: With the Japanese coach?

291
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

292
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

293
00:21:38,318 --> 00:21:45,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a couple of friends that live in Japan that I want to visit, but I also have people I know in England that I want to visit, so I have to think.

294
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:48,203
[SPEAKER_13]: See, if I really wanted to learn Japanese, what I would do is get Jamie a device.

295
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I am not a scroll!

296
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:51,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Where every time I mispronounce a word, she shocks me.

297
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:56,928
[SPEAKER_13]: But the problem is that she would use that device for things other than its intended purpose, so I don't allow her to have this device.

298
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:58,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Hanukkah Harry said I was a scroll.

299
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,121
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not a Skrull!

300
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:02,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Let Bradley finish his gaming week.

301
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:10,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'll go a little bit farther than this week, because other than this, it's been a while since I've been here.

302
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:19,975
[SPEAKER_12]: The other things I've been playing is Castlevania Lament of Innocence, which, even though I heard people saying it was bad or something, it's actually a pretty good game.

303
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:28,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Other than the camera issues, which you can't see half the time, because it's looking in the other direction from the actual degree of movement, it's actually pretty enjoyable, and

304
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,822
[SPEAKER_12]: The voice acting is really good.

305
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:38,292
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing was Zelda Phantom Hourglass, which I still got a ways to go in.

306
00:22:39,273 --> 00:22:39,954
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a fun game.

307
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:41,516
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

308
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:43,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm reading some other comments in the chat room.

309
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:51,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Akuma JP says, commenting on my reading of the Japanese release dates, Skye sometimes get very good when he is in a good mood, but no idea when he is not in the mood.

310
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:55,660
[SPEAKER_13]: So apparently if I'm in a good mood, I'll do better at reading the release dates.

311
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,683
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll try to smile before I read the dates tonight so I'm in a good mood, although I don't think we have a lot this week.

312
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:07,567
[SPEAKER_13]: My gaming week, real quickly, because pretty much everything I wanted to talk about has already been talked about.

313
00:23:09,449 --> 00:23:13,091
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King, as you know, I'm addicted to MMOs.

314
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:16,253
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would like to congratulate our guild for clearing Naxx.

315
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:18,875
[SPEAKER_13]: That was pretty awesome, which is one of the big raids at the end.

316
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:21,717
[SPEAKER_13]: We cleared 10-man Naxx this week, which is nice.

317
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:24,319
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other thing I've been playing is...

318
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:31,481
[SPEAKER_13]: The Metal Gear Solid expansion on the little big planet, which is amazing, and everybody should buy it.

319
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:39,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Because not only does it come with the whole gun and things you can put in your own levels, I don't even design levels, but I just kind of wanted to see.

320
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:47,771
[SPEAKER_13]: My thought was that probably Media Molecule designed some levels to unlock this stuff in, because I heard that you actually had to play these levels to unlock the stuff.

321
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:52,754
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're basically getting, you know what, five or so new Media Molecule levels, and they are great.

322
00:23:53,715 --> 00:24:21,839
[SPEAKER_13]: and I realized I could go online and download a ton of other levels but there's something about having the official developer with official unlocks being able to play those levels and they are fantastic something Loki kind of neglected to mention is that not only can you run through them once but you can go back and you can play through these same levels again with new challenge elements on them you'll get stickers at the very end that you can go back and place at the very beginning and then suddenly the entire level becomes a race which makes some of those things like the stealth level and stuff become very interesting because you're trying to rush but not too much

323
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:24,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually gotten most of the trophies for the entire thing.

324
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,864
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I think I have all the trophies except for the one beating the last boss under a certain time limit, but I have all the other trophies.

325
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:34,345
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think I've unlocked a single trophy yet, sadly.

326
00:24:34,465 --> 00:24:35,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I've aced all the levels.

327
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:43,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten every single bit of collectible stuff in the game, or at least in those levels.

328
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm missing like two stickers in one level that is bugging the hell out of me because I can't figure out where they are.

329
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're talking about, the third level.

330
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:49,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

331
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:50,633
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you know?

332
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:51,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are they?

333
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:53,434
[SPEAKER_13]: You tell me now.

334
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:54,695
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'll tell you now.

335
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:58,877
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that spot where you have to shoot the green thing so the platform's lower down?

336
00:24:58,937 --> 00:24:59,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

337
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:04,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, on the second one that lowers down, you walk through to the left, and there's a hallway that you can walk through.

338
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:06,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shut up.

339
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:06,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

340
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:08,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it took me forever to figure that out.

341
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:09,201
[SPEAKER_13]: That is so crazy.

342
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:10,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't even have to tell you what it is.

343
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:13,384
[SPEAKER_13]: It's frustrating me, and I know exactly what you're talking about.

344
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:14,345
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, nope, I haven't been there.

345
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:14,985
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.

346
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:15,706
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm missing.

347
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:21,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I had to read the comments for the actual level, and there was questions about that in there, and that's where they said it was.

348
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, ah, because I knew just plain level.

349
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, there's something down there.

350
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:26,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know how to get down there.

351
00:25:26,673 --> 00:25:29,655
[SPEAKER_13]: The network was down the day I was trying to play, so I couldn't do that.

352
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:30,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

353
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:33,856
[SPEAKER_13]: But I gotta say, honestly, if you have LittleBigPlanet, check out the expansion.

354
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:34,656
[SPEAKER_13]: You won't be disappointed.

355
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:39,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if you don't build levels, I think the five or so levels that come with it are... It's six bucks.

356
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:40,558
[SPEAKER_13]: It's worth it.

357
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:41,498
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is.

358
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:46,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, let's move on with tonight's show and try to get into some gaming news.

359
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,980
[SPEAKER_13]: But first, some housekeeping tonight.

360
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,141
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, we want to make sure everybody had a really wonderful holiday.

361
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:57,863
[SPEAKER_13]: And just a quick reminder, although we didn't take off any shows for the holiday, we will not be here January...

362
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,365
[SPEAKER_13]: January 11th, I believe is the day.

363
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:03,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, January 11th, we will not be here.

364
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:05,768
[SPEAKER_13]: So no yelling at Bobby if he goes long.

365
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:06,709
[SPEAKER_13]: January 11th.

366
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:08,070
[SPEAKER_13]: He can go till midnight if he wants.

367
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,191
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really care.

368
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:12,692
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

369
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:41,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know what all the Toda KK songs are called now.

370
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:47,648
[SPEAKER_10]: And he got me these Kingdom Hearts promo cards that they had at his store.

371
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of wanted them, so he grabbed me some.

372
00:26:50,529 --> 00:27:00,931
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got the Silent Hill Homecoming soundtrack, which a lucky person is going to be receiving a copy as well, but I won't say anything more than that.

373
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:02,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh.

374
00:27:02,632 --> 00:27:02,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

375
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:07,381
[SPEAKER_10]: and Candy.

376
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:10,206
[SPEAKER_10]: and I got a coat.

377
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:12,707
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a funny story about my coat.

378
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:15,267
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember the coat I was wearing last week?

379
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I do.

380
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:18,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Becky and I were going shopping.

381
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:20,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Did someone knock on the door?

382
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:21,048
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

383
00:27:21,188 --> 00:27:21,308
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

384
00:27:21,608 --> 00:27:33,310
[SPEAKER_10]: We were going shopping and we saw these coats at this one retailer who I will not mention and we thought they were cute so we went in and it was marked down from $89 to $39 and they would buy one and get one half price.

385
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,711
[SPEAKER_10]: So we just gifted each other coats and they were really cool.

386
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:38,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

387
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:55,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Aw, Loki.

388
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:56,219
[SPEAKER_13]: You're the best.

389
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, no problem.

390
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:58,841
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

391
00:27:59,001 --> 00:27:59,562
[SPEAKER_10]: One other thing.

392
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:00,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah?

393
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:01,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I got Knights on Wii.

394
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:02,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, how's that?

395
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:03,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Haven't opened it yet.

396
00:28:04,385 --> 00:28:14,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't get any, like, games or anything, but Ranma did send me this shirt that says Companion Cube is my co-pilot, so thank you very much to Ranma who sent me that shirt, which I think is great.

397
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,012
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very cute.

398
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:16,793
[SPEAKER_10]: My shirt says, No, you cannot have...

399
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:19,635
[SPEAKER_13]: and I'm being very scummy because I wore it yesterday too.

400
00:28:19,715 --> 00:28:24,378
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm doing that really gross thing where I wore the same shirt two days in a row because I was lazy today.

401
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:26,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really leave the house, so whatevs.

402
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on, you've all been there too.

403
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:28,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Admit it.

404
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,253
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

405
00:28:56,188 --> 00:29:00,690
[SPEAKER_13]: But it all starts January 9th, and they are taping live at a computer arena in Atlanta.

406
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:06,753
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's going to be other people on, and they're going to actually dissect game consoles and repair them live on air.

407
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:08,574
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's actually kind of a multimedia thing.

408
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:09,595
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just a radio.

409
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,595
[SPEAKER_13]: They're doing TV, too.

410
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:12,136
[SPEAKER_13]: So it sounds pretty exciting.

411
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:13,136
[SPEAKER_13]: I just sent them my broken 360.

412
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:14,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck fixing that one.

413
00:29:14,937 --> 00:29:19,019
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you have to take a number for that, because I think they already have lined up what they're doing for the first two shows.

414
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,660
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't want it back.

415
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,601
[SPEAKER_03]: They can just have it?

416
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:25,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe they'd take it.

417
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:25,510
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

418
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,252
[SPEAKER_13]: I've talked to Bobby.

419
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:28,181
[SPEAKER_13]: FNG Life.net

420
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, unfortunately, it's not for our region, though.

421
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, Japan... What happens in Japan might happen here, right?

422
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not so much, I don't think.

423
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:14,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you know, Japan, they do a lot of things over there, especially with their WiiWare service and Nintendo and that kind of stuff, that we will probably never see over here.

424
00:30:15,787 --> 00:30:18,789
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, you know, they got, a while back, a...

425
00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:29,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was a couple WiiWare downloads, but they have a new manga comics that you can actually download on the service, which is kind of neat.

426
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:33,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, they had their Nintendo channel for a while before we did.

427
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're getting another channel, and it's not too surprising since the other two consoles also have one similar.

428
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:45,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new video streaming service that will be available now.

429
00:30:46,894 --> 00:30:50,699
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually in conjunction with Densetsu.

430
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:03,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Not your typical video download service because they're not going to have movies.

431
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:06,483
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to really have a lot of TV shows and stuff.

432
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,323
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're going to have, though, is like... Oh, my God.

433
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:10,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it what I've always been waiting for?

434
00:31:10,464 --> 00:31:11,705
[SPEAKER_13]: A porno-on-demand service?

435
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:13,285
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not a porno-on-demand service.

436
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:20,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually going to be some... They're going to have Nintendo videos on there, whatever that's supposed to be.

437
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:24,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's like the old Nintendo cartoons, you know, like the old Donkey Kong stuff and...

438
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,869
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

439
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:54,157
[SPEAKER_13]: There's that humming that one of the mics is causing.

440
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:54,898
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know which one.

441
00:31:55,658 --> 00:31:55,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it?

442
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:57,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, here.

443
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,020
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a very naughty microphone.

444
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, guys.

445
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Live radio.

446
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:02,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

447
00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:06,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, it's going to be coming early next year.

448
00:32:06,963 --> 00:32:13,586
[SPEAKER_03]: No prices have been announced yet, but interesting, though, that they're going to be bringing this out.

449
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:15,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is something that's coming to the U.S.

450
00:32:17,828 --> 00:32:18,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how this...

451
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:27,283
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, if you've ever used the web browser in this, the bandwidth to the Wii seems very, very slow.

452
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:32,964
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you imagine actually downloading content with the Wii, like actual videos and stuff?

453
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:34,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would take forever.

454
00:32:34,945 --> 00:32:39,726
[SPEAKER_13]: We kind of need that upgrade that's supposed to get our SD cards, which wasn't that supposed to be out by the end of the year?

455
00:32:39,746 --> 00:32:39,786
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

456
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:46,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, that won't be coming out until... You'll probably have to buy a game that'll unlock that or some shit.

457
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:50,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Hitstun in chat says, Sky, porno on demand service equals the internet.

458
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, touche.

459
00:32:51,797 --> 00:32:53,737
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can't really get that on my TV very easily.

460
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:58,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I can use the internet channel or the PS3's internet thingy, I know, but they suck.

461
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:00,878
[SPEAKER_13]: They're clunky.

462
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:03,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you tried using YouTube on the Wii?

463
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:04,019
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not that good.

464
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:05,779
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can do porno too.

465
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:07,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We did that one time, actually.

466
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,600
[SPEAKER_13]: It was clunky.

467
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that was actually last New Year's, wasn't it?

468
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:16,623
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

469
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:36,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh Lord, please let them do a sequel to this video.

470
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:37,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Amen.

471
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:38,565
[SPEAKER_13]: And pterodactyl porn.

472
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:42,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Food Delivery Channel is coming to Japan as well.

473
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:43,489
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

474
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:48,272
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to get food delivered to you, you can now do that through your Wii.

475
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:48,933
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called the...

476
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Dimei Channel, the food delivery channel.

477
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:53,953
[SPEAKER_13]: 8,500 different restaurants.

478
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:56,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently you are going to be able to browse it by genre.

479
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:01,156
[SPEAKER_13]: So like, you know, pizza, bento boxes, sushi, curry, Chinese, whatever.

480
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:06,717
[SPEAKER_13]: You apparently can go on here and the restaurants will actually estimate what the delivery time is.

481
00:34:07,017 --> 00:34:08,378
[SPEAKER_13]: You place the order on the Wii.

482
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:12,439
[SPEAKER_13]: It's faxed to the restaurant and then it's kind of like ordering it on the internet.

483
00:34:12,939 --> 00:34:15,201
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was kind of like, this has got to be bullshit.

484
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:18,603
[SPEAKER_13]: But apparently, there's screenshots and everything.

485
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:24,867
[SPEAKER_13]: And granted, this stuff can be photoshopped, but I don't know why someone would want to waste that colossal amount of time on a stupid prank on Christmas.

486
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:26,448
[SPEAKER_13]: So this looks to be the real deal.

487
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:27,989
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't know that we would report on it.

488
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:29,270
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess so.

489
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, but this looks to be pretty authentic.

490
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:35,774
[SPEAKER_13]: And which is strange, because people predicted that this might happen a long time ago.

491
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:37,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I suppose people predicted everything.

492
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:42,298
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, you look at this here, and there's even a screenshot here where somebody can click on Pizza Hut and order pizza.

493
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:44,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

494
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:47,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

495
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:53,797
[SPEAKER_03]: If they did something like this in the U.S., do you think... Man, Pizza Hut is... Talk about, like, a whore for, like, ordering stuff.

496
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:56,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, before they were in, like, EverQuest.

497
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash Pizza, yeah.

498
00:34:57,802 --> 00:34:58,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're in this.

499
00:34:59,003 --> 00:35:03,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to have a Pizza Hut here with the Japanese menu.

500
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:11,959
[SPEAKER_10]: No, seriously, I was seeing one of the people I keep up with lived over there and posted a picture of the order menu.

501
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,862
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some very funky pizzas.

502
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:17,367
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like something out of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or California Pizza Kitchen.

503
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:19,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Or John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?

504
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:19,650
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

505
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

506
00:35:22,313 --> 00:35:30,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, yeah, the thing is, though, I don't think a channel like that would work here because we're not so, we're so spread out here in the U.S.

507
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:33,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas in Japan, there's a lot more kind of, you know what I mean?

508
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:35,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I don't think it might work in different cities.

509
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:44,054
[SPEAKER_13]: It might work in different, like, it might, they might be able to do that for New York City for, well, I don't even know if you could do it in Los Angeles and make it worth it.

510
00:35:44,174 --> 00:35:44,495
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

511
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:45,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Pizza Hut equals Kaka Hut

512
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, that's probably one of the pizzas you can get in Japan.

513
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:14,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

514
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:18,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you, their pasta is pretty good.

515
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:26,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually thought about getting some of that, but the tray of pasta that they give you is huge, and that would just look ridiculous if I'm eating a huge tray of pasta here.

516
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:28,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodness, we don't have the camera anymore.

517
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:30,109
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have the camera.

518
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:31,850
[SPEAKER_13]: You could bring an entire cake.

519
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,710
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, though, I wouldn't.

520
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,131
[SPEAKER_13]: You could bring an entire cake and eat it on here.

521
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:36,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that much cake.

522
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,472
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just say, Fatty's eating cake again.

523
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:40,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Fatty's eating cake.

524
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:41,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like cake.

525
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I did want to make a meatball sub, though.

526
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:53,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw, like, on the Food Network, they had this thing where they were making it over in someone's kitchen, and that's what they decided to make is a meatball sub.

527
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:54,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, damn, it looks good.

528
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:56,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden, you know, I got craving for a meatball sub.

529
00:36:57,738 --> 00:37:01,402
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the Pizza Hut menu in Japan as of June.

530
00:37:02,663 --> 00:37:04,364
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want you to tell me if this sounds tasty to you.

531
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:12,352
[SPEAKER_10]: There's bacon mushroom, barbecue chicken, carbonara, which is bacon, egg spread, and black pepper.

532
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:13,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Without the egg spread, yes.

533
00:37:14,474 --> 00:37:15,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheese and cheese.

534
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:16,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

535
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:16,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

536
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:18,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes and yes.

537
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:25,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Crab and Shrimp Mayo King, which is fried shrimp, fake crab, corn, onion, broccoli, and mayonnaise.

538
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:26,720
[SPEAKER_13]: I need the listeners to understand this.

539
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,201
[SPEAKER_13]: I fucking hate mayonnaise.

540
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:34,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you ever give me anything with mayonnaise even remotely near it because mayonnaise will ruin anything for me.

541
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:35,048
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate mayonnaise.

542
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:36,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate, hate, hate mayonnaise.

543
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate warm mayonnaise.

544
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:41,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Because warm mayonnaise, like mayonnaise on burgers, awful.

545
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:43,130
[SPEAKER_03]: On sandwiches, okay.

546
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, these are great.

547
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the deluxe is pepperoni, salami, bacon, and green peppers, blah, blah, blah.

548
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes, yes.

549
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:50,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Gomadari pork, I'd actually eat that.

550
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:54,692
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a burdock root mix, sesame sauce pork, shredded seaweed, and sesame sauce.

551
00:37:55,892 --> 00:38:01,233
[SPEAKER_10]: The Idaho special is diced potatoes, bacon, onions, corn, parsley, black pepper, and mayonnaise.

552
00:38:01,892 --> 00:38:03,394
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds awesome except for the mayonnaise part.

553
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,858
[SPEAKER_10]: There's one called the Mayo Q. If you can guess what that is, it's barbecue with mayonnaise.

554
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:09,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Meat Paradise.

555
00:38:10,281 --> 00:38:13,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.

556
00:38:14,846 --> 00:38:15,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

557
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:16,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that sound good to you?

558
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:17,469
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to go to Japan.

559
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:18,570
[SPEAKER_13]: What was it?

560
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,952
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called the Meat Paradise.

561
00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:20,632
[SPEAKER_10]: And?

562
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:23,776
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pepperoni, salami, ham, pork, beef, and bacon.

563
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:29,444
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like, they have it already over here.

564
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:34,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the Montague's All Meat Marvel.

565
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:42,954
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to have beef on their pizzas, but they don't do it anymore because apparently not that many people like beef and it kind of went bad because no one ate it.

566
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:47,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a Sicilian style pizza with tuna, mushrooms, and meat sauce.

567
00:38:47,938 --> 00:38:48,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate tuna too.

568
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,740
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do a meat pizza round table over here.

569
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:59,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have multiple varieties of different pepperonis and different sausages.

570
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:02,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have chicken, too, and ham.

571
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:04,526
[SPEAKER_03]: God, we could just pile that shit up.

572
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:08,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember someone that used to order a quad sausage pizza.

573
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:09,788
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be four times the amount of sausage.

574
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:14,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I kid you not, it was like a giant patty on top of the entire...

575
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Pizza.

576
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,251
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, what is wrong with you people?

577
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:18,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, Rob.

578
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,012
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's for you.

579
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:21,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Mochi, mentai, and potato.

580
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:29,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Large shrimp, diced potatoes, Korean mochi, corn, onion, mayonnaise, we'll ask for it without, shredded seaweed, and fish roe sauce.

581
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:31,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Mochi?

582
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,541
[SPEAKER_10]: or there's the seafood mix, which is large shrimp, squid, tuna, and mayonnaise, broccoli, and onion.

583
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:40,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Who puts, I want to know who puts corn on a pizza.

584
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:44,203
[SPEAKER_10]: All the rest of it, I could take, but corn is fucking disgusting.

585
00:39:44,243 --> 00:39:44,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen it.

586
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:46,624
[SPEAKER_10]: And then again, I'm also allergic to corn.

587
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:48,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Better yet, who puts mayonnaise on a pizza?

588
00:39:48,905 --> 00:39:51,726
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they put mayonnaise on everything in Japan.

589
00:39:53,345 --> 00:39:53,966
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can't go to Japan.

590
00:39:53,986 --> 00:39:54,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

591
00:39:54,506 --> 00:39:55,467
[SPEAKER_10]: The last one on here.

592
00:39:55,647 --> 00:39:56,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd die of starvation.

593
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Tartar Chicken Nanban.

594
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:03,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Nanban Chicken, Red Peppers, Parsley, Tartar Sauce, and Nanban Sauce.

595
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:07,900
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as Nanban doesn't mean like asshole juice, I'll be fine.

596
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:10,342
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically Portuguese-style chicken.

597
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:11,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that's fine.

598
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:12,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, what is that?

599
00:40:14,186 --> 00:40:16,008
[SPEAKER_13]: When you're talking about a chicken, it could be anything.

600
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:18,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow.

601
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:25,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of this is just like... I would actually eat it, though, because some of this stuff, I'd order something similar.

602
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:28,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And really, the cheese and cheese is like a margarita.

603
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,034
[SPEAKER_10]: The margarita pizza.

604
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:36,695
[SPEAKER_10]: But I actually would order some of this stuff, because I have it at CPK, but still.

605
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:42,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I ordered... How did this turn into Orange Lounge Foodio, going on like 15 minutes now?

606
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:45,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this is why I want them to deliver Japanese-style pizza.

607
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:48,734
[SPEAKER_13]: And poor Bobby got chased off the air for this.

608
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:49,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, he did.

609
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:51,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Non-bond chicken.

610
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:54,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if he was talking about pizza, we would have been fine with that.

611
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Note to Bobby, your show needs more meat.

612
00:40:59,001 --> 00:40:59,261
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

613
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:01,322
[SPEAKER_00]: You need meat paradise.

614
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:02,663
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, stop picking on Bobby.

615
00:41:02,803 --> 00:41:03,104
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

616
00:41:05,205 --> 00:41:08,107
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, what else is going on in gaming news?

617
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:13,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there is this plumber named Mario who lives near a pizza place.

618
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:13,607
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

619
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:22,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it's something to be coming out for the virtual console in Japan is Super Smash Bros.

620
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:25,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the Nintendo 64 one.

621
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:26,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Dun dun dun.

622
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:28,333
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be there in January.

623
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:32,115
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to be out there for 1,200 points each.

624
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:41,275
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's no real say as to when we'd probably get it out here.

625
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:45,217
[SPEAKER_10]: But that means we probably will be getting it since we tend to get some of the stuff.

626
00:41:46,397 --> 00:41:53,681
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was a release yawn and hither, then it would definitely be duplicated over here, I would think.

627
00:41:56,323 --> 00:41:56,803
[SPEAKER_10]: So there.

628
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:58,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob?

629
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:00,385
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds nice.

630
00:42:00,505 --> 00:42:02,226
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I would download that.

631
00:42:02,406 --> 00:42:02,666
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

632
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:03,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Meet Paradise.

633
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:10,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Looking at some comments in chat, Giovedea in chat says, I have had a taco pizza with corn on it.

634
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:10,952
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really tasty.

635
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:15,455
[SPEAKER_13]: I was trying to, it's just pizza chat.

636
00:42:15,516 --> 00:42:16,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see anything about video games.

637
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:17,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I get shrimp scampi pizza.

638
00:42:17,637 --> 00:42:20,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Except, oh, Acidic Vampire asked a good question.

639
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:21,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Will Super Smash Bros.

640
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,481
[SPEAKER_13]: 64 have online play?

641
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:23,361
[SPEAKER_13]: You wish.

642
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:23,441
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

643
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:24,142
[SPEAKER_13]: You wish.

644
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Did the Nintendo 64 version have online play?

645
00:42:29,525 --> 00:42:34,713
[SPEAKER_13]: But in Pokemon Snap, they added the feature where you can save the snaps to your Wii message board.

646
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:35,333
[SPEAKER_13]: So?

647
00:42:35,674 --> 00:42:38,798
[SPEAKER_13]: So it shows they can enhance the games if they really want to.

648
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:39,239
[SPEAKER_13]: So?

649
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:39,760
[SPEAKER_13]: And they don't.

650
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:53,181
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes you wonder, doesn't it make you wonder if maybe Pokemon Snap at one point had some type of feature to save those pictures in some type of more exportable format?

651
00:42:53,721 --> 00:43:01,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the game maybe originally was going to let you save them to some type of computer or something, and now they turned it into this thing instead?

652
00:43:01,803 --> 00:43:04,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's the only game that has had anything special happen to it.

653
00:43:05,737 --> 00:43:06,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

654
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to chat with us.

655
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:34,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Aha!

656
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:36,141
[SPEAKER_13]: That's exactly the type of thing I was looking for.

657
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:43,103
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGuru in chat, see this is why I love having a live chat room, says Pokemon Snap had a feature to download them to Blockbuster and print them out.

658
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:47,645
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not, they didn't even really, really enhance it that much.

659
00:43:47,885 --> 00:43:53,226
[SPEAKER_13]: They took a feature that everybody forgot about, including yours truly, and just changed it slightly.

660
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:55,907
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an altered enhancement.

661
00:43:57,605 --> 00:43:58,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Wasn't that a Sega Genesis game?

662
00:43:58,926 --> 00:43:59,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, forget it.

663
00:43:59,426 --> 00:44:01,588
[SPEAKER_13]: How about some release dates, Loki?

664
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:02,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Altered Enhancement?

665
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:08,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um, yeah.

666
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:11,436
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, uh, nothing coming out.

667
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:12,737
[SPEAKER_03]: At all.

668
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:13,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing?

669
00:44:13,577 --> 00:44:14,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a damn thing?

670
00:44:14,678 --> 00:44:15,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a damn thing.

671
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:16,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

672
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

673
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:23,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is not a good time of year for, um, you know, most companies are closed, and

674
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:26,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, not a thing.

675
00:44:26,169 --> 00:44:27,950
[SPEAKER_13]: Not even like Imagine?

676
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:34,994
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the Spore comic book creator, I think, was the only thing, and that's not even technically a game.

677
00:44:37,035 --> 00:44:43,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I wish I could tell you it looked much different in Japan, but it actually does not look like we have a lot of releases this week either in Japan.

678
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,162
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking very quickly to see if there's anything on Wii.

679
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:49,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how about the U.K.? ?

680
00:45:13,658 --> 00:45:15,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, we've had a call for more pizza.

681
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,761
[SPEAKER_13]: More pizza?

682
00:45:42,881 --> 00:45:44,601
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't even think about more pizza.

683
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:49,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they have like a peanut butter and jelly pizza or something in that John's Incredible crappy pizza?

684
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I don't think so.

685
00:45:51,964 --> 00:45:52,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they might.

686
00:45:52,564 --> 00:45:52,904
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

687
00:45:52,944 --> 00:46:03,148
[SPEAKER_13]: I just know, I remember the ones that are like different and crazy are the macaroni and cheese pizza and the, uh, that peanut butter one that had the actual peanuts on it, which I thought was strange.

688
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:03,428
[SPEAKER_10]: YUM

689
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:31,657
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's an ebi.

690
00:46:32,197 --> 00:46:32,998
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the same one.

691
00:46:33,018 --> 00:46:33,559
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the shrimp.

692
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:37,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the Shrimp Thousand Island Wrap.

693
00:46:38,203 --> 00:46:42,307
[SPEAKER_13]: You know when I go to Hawaii in two weeks, you know what I have to get at McDonald's?

694
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:43,048
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

695
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:43,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Spam Burger.

696
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:45,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, aren't those good?

697
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:47,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Spam Musubi.

698
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:50,315
[SPEAKER_13]: And the teriyaki pineapple thingy they do, right?

699
00:46:50,616 --> 00:46:52,698
[SPEAKER_10]: And they also have McPork.

700
00:46:54,935 --> 00:46:56,576
[SPEAKER_10]: and the Teriyaki McBurger.

701
00:46:57,436 --> 00:46:59,217
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there's more food for everyone.

702
00:46:59,257 --> 00:47:01,038
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have gaming news at some point, right?

703
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:01,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we do.

704
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:04,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at Burger King.

705
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:11,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, like the merger of spam and shrimp and hamburgers.

706
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:14,630
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

707
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:30,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

708
00:47:59,431 --> 00:48:03,614
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually very old news, apparently, and I don't understand how this slipped in.

709
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:04,655
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

710
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:06,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently this already happened, like, a long time ago.

711
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how this got mixed in there.

712
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,963
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the news, it's the old.

713
00:48:15,104 --> 00:48:16,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really old.

714
00:48:16,765 --> 00:48:21,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, looking at this, it's all, has announced on September 17th, I'm like, what the fuck?

715
00:48:21,729 --> 00:48:22,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all September 18th.

716
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:28,199
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when I was putting this together tonight, I was kind of like, I thought that already happened, but I didn't really know.

717
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,059
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

718
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:29,860
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's weird, though.

719
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, just wait until you say, and see, we were just recapping what happened this year.

720
00:48:33,582 --> 00:48:34,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're totally recapping.

721
00:48:36,944 --> 00:48:37,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck this shit.

722
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:38,325
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

723
00:48:39,006 --> 00:48:40,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if they merge or, because you know what?

724
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:43,849
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still going to put out fucking Dynasty Warriors games out the ass.

725
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:46,190
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires comes out February.

726
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:46,510
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

727
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:46,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck the show.

728
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:47,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go get pizza.

729
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:49,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

730
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:54,537
[SPEAKER_13]: The sad thing is, I'm half serious.

731
00:48:56,398 --> 00:49:03,561
[SPEAKER_13]: If there was a way we could somehow just take the camera and go out on the road and take it with us to get pizza, I would totally do it.

732
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,102
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say yes.

733
00:49:05,122 --> 00:49:07,443
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say, the hell with the show, pizza.

734
00:49:09,204 --> 00:49:09,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, sorry.

735
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:10,945
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't do that, Rob.

736
00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:11,705
[SPEAKER_10]: We love our people.

737
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:12,986
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, we do love our people.

738
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:14,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, I give up, you know.

739
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:15,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It was...

740
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:19,243
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

741
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,722
[SPEAKER_13]: They have claimed patent infringement, Konami has, and intellectual property rights infringement.

742
00:49:40,242 --> 00:49:45,304
[SPEAKER_13]: This was Konami of Korea that actually did it, because they're filing this lawsuit against a Korean company.

743
00:49:46,064 --> 00:49:48,705
[SPEAKER_13]: They filed it in the Seoul Central District Court in Korea.

744
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:50,446
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to get damages.

745
00:49:50,546 --> 00:49:54,528
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to stop Pentavision from selling the offending products, quote-unquote.

746
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:57,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Which, of course, has unleashed the outcries of...

747
00:49:58,029 --> 00:49:58,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Not fair!

748
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfair!

749
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:07,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami sues everybody and everything, and Konami, you suck, and da-da-da-da-da, and all this stuff, but... I don't know.

750
00:50:07,617 --> 00:50:08,798
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you guys feel about this?

751
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:11,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't know how many of you have played DJ Maxx.

752
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,621
[SPEAKER_13]: I've definitely seen the game played.

753
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:18,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a friend who's obsessed with it, and made it a point to show me, you know, DJ Maxx, and wanted to show me what the game was all about.

754
00:50:18,526 --> 00:50:22,009
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I did look at it and go, wow, this really looks like Beatmania.

755
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:24,872
[SPEAKER_13]: I...

756
00:50:26,738 --> 00:50:28,979
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, granted, I realize it's played with buttons.

757
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:34,562
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not exactly the same, but the look and feel was kind of the same, I'm sorry to say.

758
00:50:36,463 --> 00:50:37,224
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know.

759
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:41,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Do the people that say, hey, Konami just sues everything, is there a point here?

760
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:41,766
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

761
00:50:41,826 --> 00:50:42,446
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you guys think?

762
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:44,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really not surprised in the least.

763
00:50:45,288 --> 00:50:47,329
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just going to roll my eyes and go next.

764
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:56,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I am surprised because I thought, and I could be very wrong about this, but I thought that

765
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:07,506
[SPEAKER_03]: and Pentavision, actually, the company that makes DJ Max, came out of the company that made Easy to DJ, since most of the artists in DJ Max are from Easy to DJ.

766
00:51:08,627 --> 00:51:18,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I would find that as a very big coincidence if that was not the case, but I would figure that it's more of a ripoff of Easy to DJ, and who cares?

767
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:23,920
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I thought Easy to DJ was better than Beatmania anyways, so...

768
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:38,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, and they're going to go ahead and sue them, probably because they're planning on making some crappy music game for the PSP or something, because, you know, Konami's on the latest and greatest trends for music games.

769
00:51:38,944 --> 00:51:39,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, no, they're not anymore.

770
00:51:40,185 --> 00:51:41,786
[SPEAKER_03]: They're way behind everything.

771
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:51,412
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Hanukkah Harry in chat says, it's all a trap set up by Konami by not releasing quality versions of Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Beat Mania in the US.

772
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:54,034
[SPEAKER_13]: They are setting up other companies to come out with copies of them.

773
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:58,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami then sues them and gets a piece of the action without lifting a finger except to call their lawyers.

774
00:51:59,698 --> 00:52:03,461
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, as much as that makes sense, I don't think that's it.

775
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,384
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think Konami in their minds thinks they're not doing a good enough job.

776
00:52:07,864 --> 00:52:11,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Konami thinks Rock Revolution is a quality product.

777
00:52:11,914 --> 00:52:17,415
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there are people at Konami, probably Konami Japan, that think that that is what people want.

778
00:52:19,456 --> 00:52:24,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero and Rock Band are the subpar games.

779
00:52:25,057 --> 00:52:27,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Rock Revolution is a wonderful game.

780
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:33,619
[SPEAKER_13]: And these other games are infringing on the rightful heir to the music game throne, which is Rock Revolution.

781
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:37,920
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem now is that they wanted to make a music game and...

782
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:42,873
[SPEAKER_03]: They're worried about infringing on other people's patents.

783
00:52:42,953 --> 00:52:53,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, unfortunately, since they came out with a drum that's totally different than what Drum Mania had, the best thing they could do is come out with what they did for Drum Mania, basically, and bring that over here.

784
00:52:53,836 --> 00:53:01,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And at a time, it was kind of neat as a drum game, but things have gotten a lot better since then.

785
00:53:01,757 --> 00:53:06,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can't come out with something that looks similar because they will get sued by the other companies.

786
00:53:06,699 --> 00:53:07,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll be kind of a...

787
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:09,560
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, 180 for them.

788
00:53:10,081 --> 00:53:17,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Hanaka Harry wants to clarify he was mostly joking with the comment, but I have seen that comment like for real reels and different threads around the internet about this.

789
00:53:17,788 --> 00:53:28,557
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you think I'm wrong in what I'm saying about the Konami of Japan is seriously disillusioned to their fan base, all you need to do is look at Beat and Groovy and Rock Revolution because these are the products Konami is continuing to put out.

790
00:53:29,335 --> 00:53:32,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but see, I think in Japan, though, they're actually putting out some good games over there.

791
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:42,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you look, for example, at the new Dance Dance Revolution, what would be the equivalent of Haas Party 2 over there on the Wii, it's actually a lot better than it is over here.

792
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:49,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they have different types of music and stuff like that, which obviously applies to more of the people that play the Wii over there.

793
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:55,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you also have Jew Beat and stuff like that, which look pretty good.

794
00:53:56,378 --> 00:53:56,598
[SPEAKER_03]: But,

795
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:58,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

796
00:53:58,628 --> 00:54:04,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think necessarily... I think they don't really know what their audience is anymore, and that's pretty sad.

797
00:54:07,275 --> 00:54:13,279
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, they can't honestly look at Rock Revolution as a success, because it's not.

798
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at how fast that thing price dropped.

799
00:54:16,662 --> 00:54:17,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the sales for it.

800
00:54:17,663 --> 00:54:19,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think they speak for themselves.

801
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:24,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a waste of effort on their part, and it wasn't much of an effort to begin with, so...

802
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Get what you put into it, I guess.

803
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:52,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's my thought, and tell me if I'm off-base with this one, but I believe that if you're pissed off about this, whether you're a fan of DJ Max or a fan of music games who is getting a little frustrated at Konami's putting out subpar music games and then trying to take out these other guys, I think now's the time for you to take five minutes of your life to sit down and write an angry letter.

804
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:54,086
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't mean an unprofessional letter.

805
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:55,323
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

806
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:15,939
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

807
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:41,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I don't.

808
00:55:42,253 --> 00:55:42,834
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're wrong.

809
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:45,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Because these Korean versions have been out for a while now.

810
00:55:45,815 --> 00:55:46,755
[SPEAKER_13]: But isn't it funny?

811
00:55:47,275 --> 00:55:49,176
[SPEAKER_13]: When did they sue the people that made In The Groove?

812
00:55:49,576 --> 00:55:50,796
[SPEAKER_13]: When the home version was announced.

813
00:55:51,376 --> 00:55:53,837
[SPEAKER_13]: When are they suing the people that made the Pentavision thing?

814
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:56,218
[SPEAKER_13]: When the US DJ Maxx was on its way out.

815
00:55:57,538 --> 00:55:58,559
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a correlation there.

816
00:56:00,759 --> 00:56:06,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm convinced that... I mean, I understand this is all going down in Korean court of law, but it's still an international company.

817
00:56:08,052 --> 00:56:11,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Who has, you know, much bigger interests in the U.S.

818
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:11,933
[SPEAKER_13]: and Japan.

819
00:56:13,013 --> 00:56:13,533
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know.

820
00:56:14,293 --> 00:56:19,534
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, sometimes you like to give your input on these types of protests and business stories.

821
00:56:19,674 --> 00:56:22,835
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think would be the best thing for a person to do who's ticked off?

822
00:56:24,035 --> 00:56:27,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, it's going to be, you know, send in your letters.

823
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:29,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy stock, shit, you know.

824
00:56:30,096 --> 00:56:31,316
[SPEAKER_10]: What did we say before?

825
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:32,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy stock in the company.

826
00:56:32,776 --> 00:56:35,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you have a right to be heard as a shareholder.

827
00:56:36,137 --> 00:56:36,297
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

828
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,842
[SPEAKER_13]: But don't post an angry thing on the internet.

829
00:56:40,142 --> 00:56:43,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't post petition online because you know what that's going to do?

830
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:44,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing.

831
00:56:44,926 --> 00:56:45,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely nothing.

832
00:56:45,627 --> 00:56:53,093
[SPEAKER_10]: The only type of petition that's going to have any real swing is if you get your signatures, make a copy, and send it to Konami.

833
00:56:54,194 --> 00:57:01,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Because then the people that are advocating for you at Konami, of which there have been some, look at Jason Enos.

834
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you have ever had DDR in the U.S.

835
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:03,902
[SPEAKER_13]: without him?

836
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:04,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't think so.

837
00:57:04,482 --> 00:57:05,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

838
00:57:05,814 --> 00:57:06,054
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura?

839
00:57:23,363 --> 00:57:24,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see.

840
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:33,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, just a little game that a few people were playing and then it started going poop.

841
00:57:34,391 --> 00:57:35,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Tabula Rasa!

842
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:49,503
[SPEAKER_10]: So, NCSoft is saying that Tabula Rasa is free to play and will be free to play until the 28th of February 2009 when they take down the servers.

843
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:59,665
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you can actually get a serial code from the support website and download the client and you can play.

844
00:58:00,406 --> 00:58:05,911
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, it will ask you for your credit card number, but they're not going to charge you for shit.

845
00:58:06,031 --> 00:58:08,693
[SPEAKER_10]: So, enjoy it while it lasts.

846
00:58:10,455 --> 00:58:14,018
[SPEAKER_13]: That does seem weird that they want your credit card number even though they're not actually going to charge you.

847
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:15,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't that seem a little weird?

848
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:16,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I could possibly be.

849
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:43,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

850
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:44,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, hey, free.

851
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:46,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Anybody here think they might check it out?

852
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:46,800
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

853
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:47,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope.

854
00:58:48,101 --> 00:58:48,481
[SPEAKER_13]: I might.

855
00:58:49,382 --> 00:58:49,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I might.

856
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:52,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like I want to know what I'm missing.

857
00:58:53,424 --> 00:58:57,306
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's kind of weird that they're doing this because what if suddenly people find that they really like this game?

858
00:58:58,227 --> 00:59:00,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then that gives them incentive to put it back to P2P.

859
00:59:00,868 --> 00:59:01,169
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess.

860
00:59:01,209 --> 00:59:01,509
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

861
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,502
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

862
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:33,727
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess during... In the first four days of the open beta, Home produced more money for Sony than the video download service did in its first week.

863
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:36,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not surprised.

864
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:42,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the biggest sellers are the ridiculously priced Santa outfits.

865
00:59:44,235 --> 00:59:44,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh!

866
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:45,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

867
00:59:47,057 --> 00:59:51,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And... Yeah, they basically said it's...

868
00:59:53,544 --> 00:59:54,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Make Your Trophy Room

869
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:23,843
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

870
01:00:44,229 --> 01:00:44,969
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's interesting, though?

871
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:48,711
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't say, like, what was available on the store in the first week in the video store.

872
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:56,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, maybe it's making not a fair comparison here, because maybe the video store had very slim pickings the first week, so it was, like, all old stuff.

873
01:00:56,315 --> 01:00:56,916
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't know.

874
01:00:56,956 --> 01:00:58,857
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember, because I didn't have a PS3 back then.

875
01:01:00,117 --> 01:01:00,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

876
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:03,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't use the video service, so I don't know.

877
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people are excited about Home, though.

878
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:10,734
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Trishlicious in chat says, Gotta save some cash and get a PS3 for Home.

879
01:01:10,774 --> 01:01:11,634
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to make content.

880
01:01:12,315 --> 01:01:15,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Acidic Vampire says, There are Echo Chrome cults in Home.

881
01:01:15,377 --> 01:01:15,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.

882
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

883
01:01:39,273 --> 01:01:42,315
[SPEAKER_13]: and he was actually trying to set up a gay-straight alliance club in home.

884
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,776
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a straight guy who's a supporter of gay rights.

885
01:01:45,157 --> 01:02:05,168
[SPEAKER_13]: However, he found that the words gay and bisexual were not allowed in Sony's virtual world, meaning that there were a lot of kind of words to be discovered that were not able to be used in home, including hell, Christ, Jew, which, by the way, means all derivatives of those words cannot be used either.

886
01:02:05,668 --> 01:02:07,970
[SPEAKER_13]: So you cannot say, hello.

887
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it has hell in it.

888
01:02:13,715 --> 01:02:14,436
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not lying.

889
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:24,103
[SPEAKER_13]: And the San Francisco Chronicle ran a quote from this guy who was trying to set up the club, who I think sums up the way a lot of people are thinking.

890
01:02:24,444 --> 01:02:29,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Quote, I can understand if they're filtering out profanity, but it feels like it's discrimination.

891
01:02:30,088 --> 01:02:35,312
[SPEAKER_13]: By blocking a word like gay, which is a preferred term by the gay community, you're encouraging it as a bad word.

892
01:02:37,355 --> 01:02:42,720
[SPEAKER_13]: A City Vampire in chat says gay is allowed now, so who knows, maybe Sony made a hot fix because of this news.

893
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't people just get over it?

894
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:46,843
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

895
01:02:47,324 --> 01:02:47,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Get over it.

896
01:02:49,676 --> 01:02:50,337
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

897
01:03:13,567 --> 01:03:14,268
[SPEAKER_13]: and things like that.

898
01:03:14,868 --> 01:03:16,149
[SPEAKER_13]: It just reminds me of this.

899
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:17,911
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same thing.

900
01:03:18,592 --> 01:03:19,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, I don't know.

901
01:03:19,573 --> 01:03:20,974
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not that big a deal to me.

902
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:22,355
[SPEAKER_13]: At least it's consistent.

903
01:03:22,816 --> 01:03:23,196
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

904
01:03:23,516 --> 01:03:24,277
[SPEAKER_13]: But here's my thing.

905
01:03:24,457 --> 01:03:26,199
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think they should censor words at all.

906
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Because people will get around it.

907
01:03:29,022 --> 01:03:29,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

908
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:32,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Tigerclaw says they can spell it as H3LLO.

909
01:03:32,365 --> 01:03:32,805
[SPEAKER_13]: How about this?

910
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:35,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Have an option where you can turn it on or off.

911
01:03:35,948 --> 01:03:37,490
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

912
01:03:51,425 --> 01:03:57,348
[SPEAKER_13]: If I press that button on a user, then it should send the last 20 things that user has said to Sony.

913
01:03:57,609 --> 01:04:01,471
[SPEAKER_13]: So Sony can review it and decide if this person should be allowed to be at home anymore or not.

914
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:04,933
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm abusing this, then I should have the button taken away from me.

915
01:04:05,473 --> 01:04:06,274
[SPEAKER_13]: How hard is this?

916
01:04:06,994 --> 01:04:08,075
[SPEAKER_13]: How hard would this system be?

917
01:04:08,555 --> 01:04:14,298
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I think you should be able to say fucking shit and cock and gay and fag and all that stuff as much as you want.

918
01:04:14,598 --> 01:04:15,499
[SPEAKER_13]: You can say any of it.

919
01:04:16,465 --> 01:04:17,346
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

920
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:46,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember how many pieces it took to make the Santa outfit, but it was like $2.50.

921
01:04:46,155 --> 01:04:50,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's probably $2.50 more than I should have spent it on.

922
01:04:51,999 --> 01:04:54,521
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's $2.50, and I was like, whatever.

923
01:04:54,681 --> 01:05:00,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I buy these stupid $5, $10 games from live, and who cares?

924
01:05:00,546 --> 01:05:00,886
[SPEAKER_13]: It's $2.50.

925
01:05:02,547 --> 01:05:05,990
[SPEAKER_13]: SSJ100Matt says in chat, asshole juice, definitely banned.

926
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:07,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely banned.

927
01:05:10,568 --> 01:05:12,653
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68 says Sophomore would be banned.

928
01:05:12,673 --> 01:05:13,475
[SPEAKER_13]: It has homo in it.

929
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,964
[SPEAKER_13]: S-O-P-H-O-M-O-R-E.

930
01:05:17,324 --> 01:05:18,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably another word that's banned in home.

931
01:05:19,406 --> 01:05:19,766
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

932
01:05:19,806 --> 01:05:21,887
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, at least it's consistent.

933
01:05:21,947 --> 01:05:23,048
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know.

934
01:05:23,068 --> 01:05:27,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a case of a few bad apples ruin the barrel for everyone.

935
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:30,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's people that don't know how to use these words in proper context.

936
01:05:30,272 --> 01:05:37,996
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of these assholes, the rest of us have to pay the price of this hypersensitivity and hair trigger of which we've seen Sony use before.

937
01:05:38,016 --> 01:05:39,177
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little bit plant.

938
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,719
[SPEAKER_13]: So to these people who are...

939
01:05:44,025 --> 01:05:46,126
[SPEAKER_13]: We dedicate the FUs of the week to you.

940
01:05:46,146 --> 01:05:47,467
[SPEAKER_13]: FU to Dalmore for being in Korea.

941
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:16,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to order eyeballs and wigs from that site, and they're in Korea.

942
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:21,941
[SPEAKER_10]: So a $20 pair of eyes cost me $45 after EMS shipping.

943
01:06:23,261 --> 01:06:24,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck a bunch of that.

944
01:06:25,902 --> 01:06:26,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

945
01:06:27,902 --> 01:06:30,463
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my need to buy yet another airsoft gun.

946
01:06:31,943 --> 01:06:36,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I, you know, I bought a shotgun, actually, that's pretty cool.

947
01:06:37,404 --> 01:06:40,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it shot three rounds at once, but it doesn't.

948
01:06:40,589 --> 01:06:43,810
[SPEAKER_03]: which is disappointing, but you can fire it pretty fast, which is cool.

949
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:48,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have this urge to have another AUG gun.

950
01:06:50,612 --> 01:06:52,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really shouldn't buy another one.

951
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Arcadian42, do you have any FUs of the week?

952
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:59,735
[SPEAKER_12]: FU to the never-ending clutter in my apartment, which I never get around to.

953
01:06:59,755 --> 01:07:07,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully I'll get the time off I have this week, because one of my jobs is off, so get something every day, hopefully.

954
01:07:08,696 --> 01:07:09,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

955
01:07:34,645 --> 01:07:36,607
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to braid my hair now that it's long enough.

956
01:07:36,967 --> 01:07:37,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha.

957
01:07:37,868 --> 01:07:38,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha.

958
01:07:38,548 --> 01:07:39,189
[SPEAKER_10]: No, seriously.

959
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:45,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Braid, the game that came out for Xbox Live Arcade, is going to be out on the PC between February and March 2009.

960
01:07:46,194 --> 01:07:56,562
[SPEAKER_10]: So, they don't know if it's... They actually are also thinking that there's going to be a Mac version, too, which would be cool.

961
01:07:57,363 --> 01:08:00,846
[SPEAKER_10]: And no word yet, though, if there's going to be a version for PS3.

962
01:08:02,873 --> 01:08:05,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

963
01:08:05,218 --> 01:08:07,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of PS3... See, there's games on the Mac, ha ha.

964
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:08,847
[SPEAKER_03]: A few.

965
01:08:09,687 --> 01:08:26,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of the PS3, Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 2 was just released and there is a problem with the game, unfortunately, that apparently a bunch of users are reporting that there is a glitch that renders their save files completely useless.

966
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:31,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Selecting a corrupted save file will freeze the gamers on a permanent loading screen.

967
01:08:32,173 --> 01:08:33,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently this is a...

968
01:08:34,273 --> 01:08:41,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that's going to be patched soon, however, because of the holidays, Sony's QA department is taking a little break.

969
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:45,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means that the patch will not be available until after the new year sometime in January.

970
01:08:48,043 --> 01:08:48,643
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

971
01:08:52,927 --> 01:08:55,809
[SPEAKER_13]: This seems like the type of thing that Penny Arcade would have done a comic about.

972
01:08:56,689 --> 01:08:57,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it just me?

973
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:00,332
[SPEAKER_13]: But somehow I don't think there will actually be one.

974
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:03,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, speaking of patches, this has been a long-awaited one.

975
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:08,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Castle Crashers apparently is finally getting its patch.

976
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:10,590
[SPEAKER_13]: That's only about four months late.

977
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:14,051
[SPEAKER_13]: The patch, I believe, went up this week.

978
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:18,031
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it actually was scheduled to go up on Christmas Day.

979
01:09:18,531 --> 01:09:19,212
[SPEAKER_13]: No, Christmas Eve.

980
01:09:19,852 --> 01:09:20,852
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it went up finally.

981
01:09:21,312 --> 01:09:26,533
[SPEAKER_13]: So, hey, you should go back and play some Castle Crashers because now you can online anyway.

982
01:09:27,341 --> 01:09:27,901
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

983
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:32,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, some extra things were thrown in as well, though.

984
01:09:32,743 --> 01:09:43,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Not just some fixes to the game, but apparently I think they did some other little new things, like weapons and stuff like that, and two new characters.

985
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:45,706
[SPEAKER_13]: The king is one of them, and so on.

986
01:09:46,086 --> 01:09:46,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And a chainsaw?

987
01:09:46,786 --> 01:09:47,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I see a chainsaw?

988
01:09:47,727 --> 01:09:49,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, there is a new weapon, the chainsaw.

989
01:09:51,148 --> 01:09:51,448
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

990
01:09:51,468 --> 01:09:52,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to play that now.

991
01:09:53,362 --> 01:09:54,223
[SPEAKER_13]: So check that out.

992
01:09:55,644 --> 01:09:59,166
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one of those titles I didn't pay money for because everybody told me you really couldn't play it online.

993
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:00,848
[SPEAKER_13]: But maybe I'll go back and check it out now.

994
01:10:00,928 --> 01:10:04,550
[SPEAKER_13]: But I still think... My gut tells me they'll put it on sale in three months' time.

995
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:04,991
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know.

996
01:10:05,011 --> 01:10:05,731
[SPEAKER_13]: I might try to hold out.

997
01:10:06,132 --> 01:10:07,793
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGuru in chat says, Castle Crashers?

998
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:08,213
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?

999
01:10:08,253 --> 01:10:09,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Who cares about that anymore?

1000
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,416
[SPEAKER_13]: TwitchAscidicVampire says, I like Castle Crashers.

1001
01:10:13,057 --> 01:10:13,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Cry.

1002
01:10:15,018 --> 01:10:15,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, let's move on.

1003
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:19,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving forward...

1004
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:26,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry, I completely blinked.

1005
01:10:27,668 --> 01:10:28,929
[SPEAKER_10]: How about the Gizmondo?

1006
01:10:31,031 --> 01:10:32,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we remember this thing?

1007
01:10:32,152 --> 01:10:32,673
[SPEAKER_13]: How about it?

1008
01:10:33,914 --> 01:10:37,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they are once again rescheduling the launch of the Gizmondo.

1009
01:10:37,337 --> 01:10:38,338
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't given up.

1010
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:44,023
[SPEAKER_10]: The quote says it's due to the economic climate in the U.S.

1011
01:10:44,543 --> 01:10:45,864
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as the rest of the world.

1012
01:10:46,265 --> 01:10:49,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it might have something to do with your product being crap.

1013
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:50,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1014
01:10:52,432 --> 01:11:02,214
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, they were deciding to turn the Gizmondo into a smartphone with a 3D graphics chip and an open platform.

1015
01:11:02,974 --> 01:11:06,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, they're just trying to make another gaming taco.

1016
01:11:08,575 --> 01:11:09,656
[SPEAKER_13]: But open platform?

1017
01:11:10,276 --> 01:11:18,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they actually wanted to have an open source app store for the Apple store compatibility.

1018
01:11:18,717 --> 01:11:20,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's kind of nice.

1019
01:11:20,398 --> 01:11:20,878
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that.

1020
01:11:21,018 --> 01:11:21,558
[SPEAKER_13]: I like open.

1021
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:24,717
[SPEAKER_10]: And they wanted to make the price point $99.

1022
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:27,881
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe.

1023
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:29,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Still wouldn't buy it.

1024
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:35,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you anything that Duke Nukem Forever will be on it.

1025
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:39,587
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's funny though?

1026
01:11:39,907 --> 01:11:47,269
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny they want to go that route, but I probably wouldn't buy one just because of the fact that I have an iPhone and so I can have the open stuff already.

1027
01:11:47,789 --> 01:11:49,250
[SPEAKER_13]: I can get almost anything on my iPhone.

1028
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:53,471
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to have to show me something I can get on their system that I cannot get on my phone.

1029
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:57,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of delays and revisions before the product's even released.

1030
01:11:58,192 --> 01:11:59,673
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you can get with the Gizmondo.

1031
01:11:59,953 --> 01:12:16,040
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I gotta say, though, I know you're not a big fan of the iPhones, Loki, but I gotta say, it is pretty impressive that I can have movies that I like and music and games and apps on my phone in my pocket everywhere I go.

1032
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:23,076
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get a wonderful data plan that goes along with that that's really expensive.

1033
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:24,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

1034
01:12:25,396 --> 01:12:26,817
[SPEAKER_13]: It's worth it, honestly.

1035
01:12:27,057 --> 01:12:28,157
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not worth it.

1036
01:12:28,397 --> 01:12:30,757
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing people forget, in my opinion, it's worth it.

1037
01:12:31,837 --> 01:12:37,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, like with my iPhone, for me and Dan, our overall cost went up by $10.

1038
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:39,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Only.

1039
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:45,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Once we, you know, adjusted some stuff we were being overcharged for before, but still...

1040
01:12:46,893 --> 01:12:48,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.

1041
01:12:48,335 --> 01:12:49,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I got Katamari now.

1042
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:53,820
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68 says, I have an iPod Touch, thereby bypassing the phone plan thingy.

1043
01:12:54,341 --> 01:12:58,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma says, yeah, but Sky, my phone does the same thing and I don't have to pay an extra fee for it.

1044
01:12:59,345 --> 01:12:59,786
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1045
01:12:59,986 --> 01:13:00,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Diverse opinions.

1046
01:13:01,345 --> 01:13:03,648
[SPEAKER_03]: No thanks, I will never own an Apple product.

1047
01:13:03,908 --> 01:13:04,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Never, ever.

1048
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:12,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if Nintendo had a fucking orgy with Apple and their next product is like super awesome virtual reality that pleasures me.

1049
01:13:12,939 --> 01:13:15,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not buy this fucking system if it's Apple.

1050
01:13:15,943 --> 01:13:16,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1051
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I will never, ever own anything.

1052
01:13:20,368 --> 01:13:30,776
[SPEAKER_03]: If they make a pacemaker that's the only pacemaker on the face of the planet that will save my life, I will say let me die before I even take that thing.

1053
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:31,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1054
01:13:32,378 --> 01:13:35,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Never, ever will I fall victim to them.

1055
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:47,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Please somebody record this part of the show just in case because you know there's going to be that day where Apple puts out bacon or something that Loki is going to have it and we all have to remind him of this moment and say, told you so.

1056
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:49,411
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1057
01:13:49,731 --> 01:13:54,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, apparently there is a new Guitar Hero coming out.

1058
01:13:54,674 --> 01:13:55,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Shock!

1059
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:56,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Another Guitar Hero?

1060
01:13:56,895 --> 01:13:57,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1061
01:13:57,276 --> 01:13:58,296
[SPEAKER_03]: That they would do that?

1062
01:13:58,716 --> 01:14:00,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this one's on the DS.

1063
01:14:00,378 --> 01:14:01,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know.

1064
01:14:01,138 --> 01:14:01,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It's surprising.

1065
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:05,020
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what, three releases in a matter of months?

1066
01:14:05,581 --> 01:14:07,822
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a new DS game coming out.

1067
01:14:08,503 --> 01:14:14,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually found out through a description on the ESRB website.

1068
01:14:14,627 --> 01:14:16,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Guitar Hero Modern Hits.

1069
01:14:18,111 --> 01:14:18,853
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be coming out.

1070
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:25,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've already figured out what three of the songs are going to be based on this short description that was talking about possible offensive lyrics.

1071
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:37,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the three songs that are pretty much confirmed to be in the game, Sum 41's Still Waiting, Franz Ferdinand's The Fallen, and Paralyzer by Finger Eleven.

1072
01:14:37,905 --> 01:14:48,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And no word on when Modern Hits will be out, but you can better believe it, there'll be a ton more releases next year for Guitar Hero, both on the DS and probably on the rest of it.

1073
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:50,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the DSi going to screw this all up?

1074
01:14:52,128 --> 01:14:52,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1075
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,423
[SPEAKER_03]: You think there'll be several versions or what?

1076
01:15:15,664 --> 01:15:21,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just don't think that they'll put out a version for the DSi or maybe the DSi gets drums or something stupid like that.

1077
01:15:21,989 --> 01:15:32,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, they could maybe make a new peripheral for the DSi that would plug into the SD card slot.

1078
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:33,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a thought.

1079
01:15:35,061 --> 01:15:37,864
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe a DSi only version or something like that.

1080
01:15:41,064 --> 01:15:45,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to be an issue, though, because like I said, there's so many systems out there right now for the DS.

1081
01:15:45,867 --> 01:15:50,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually kind of surprised that they're even releasing DSi anytime soon in the U.S.

1082
01:15:50,289 --> 01:15:53,791
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're still selling tons and tons and tons of DSs.

1083
01:15:54,452 --> 01:15:58,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would wait until it slows down before they release the DSi.

1084
01:15:59,014 --> 01:16:00,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Parting kind of thinks they're not.

1085
01:16:00,715 --> 01:16:08,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that they are going to probably release the DSi soon just to try to get people to buy another DS.

1086
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like they did with the Game Boy Advance.

1087
01:16:11,221 --> 01:16:13,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Never forget how many times you bought the Game Boy Advance.

1088
01:16:14,642 --> 01:16:15,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the Game Boy.

1089
01:16:16,804 --> 01:16:17,924
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times did they release it?

1090
01:16:18,224 --> 01:16:23,947
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Player, Game Boy Advance.

1091
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:25,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we get it, we get it.

1092
01:16:26,887 --> 01:16:30,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, another lawsuit going on in the Nintendo world.

1093
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:38,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo is getting sued over their DS Lite charger and it's because of a fire that happened in January of 2007 in Kentucky.

1094
01:16:39,455 --> 01:16:44,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently the victims were compensated by the insurance company as usually happens with those types of things.

1095
01:16:44,718 --> 01:16:48,460
[SPEAKER_13]: The insurance company though filed a complaint against Nintendo now.

1096
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,401
[SPEAKER_13]: In the U.S.

1097
01:16:49,461 --> 01:16:58,628
[SPEAKER_13]: District Court, saying, quote, the DS was defective in design, manufacture, and or because it failed to warn consumers as to dangers associated with it.

1098
01:16:58,668 --> 01:17:04,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Due to defects existing within the product, which caused a risk of overheating and fire, the product was recalled by Nintendo.

1099
01:17:05,293 --> 01:17:10,077
[SPEAKER_13]: So what makes this notable, in my opinion, is that you can't blame this on some crazy asshole.

1100
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,479
[SPEAKER_13]: But now it's some crazy asshole's insurance company.

1101
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:13,079
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm just teasing.

1102
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,142
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, it's an insurance company suing Nintendo now.

1103
01:17:17,761 --> 01:17:18,541
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you guys think?

1104
01:17:19,062 --> 01:17:21,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Hearing that this is coming from an actual other company.

1105
01:17:21,242 --> 01:17:22,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is Liberty Mutual.

1106
01:17:22,503 --> 01:17:24,484
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not some little podunk insurance company.

1107
01:17:24,944 --> 01:17:26,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Is suing Nintendo over the charger?

1108
01:17:26,504 --> 01:17:28,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think it's going to be a valid thing?

1109
01:17:28,365 --> 01:17:29,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think people are too sue-happy?

1110
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:31,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Any thoughts?

1111
01:17:32,667 --> 01:17:36,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they forgot how hot the DS really is.

1112
01:17:38,109 --> 01:17:39,129
[SPEAKER_03]: So hot that it catches fire.

1113
01:17:40,809 --> 01:17:49,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if it's a liability issue and they haven't put in any type of significant warning, that is negligence on the part of Nintendo.

1114
01:17:50,397 --> 01:17:51,899
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, it's a legitimate suit.

1115
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see any problem with it.

1116
01:17:56,442 --> 01:17:58,404
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1117
01:17:58,884 --> 01:17:59,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

1118
01:17:59,705 --> 01:18:04,249
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68 in chat says, I think everybody is trying to kill Nintendo with lawsuit-y death.

1119
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:06,651
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who should sue Nintendo?

1120
01:18:06,871 --> 01:18:07,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Kami.

1121
01:18:07,632 --> 01:18:08,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the circle will be complete.

1122
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,492
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the circle of lawsuits.

1123
01:18:14,834 --> 01:18:15,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Forget it.

1124
01:18:31,738 --> 01:18:32,418
[SPEAKER_13]: We want music, Rob!

1125
01:18:32,438 --> 01:18:33,179
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gonna take a minute.

1126
01:18:33,219 --> 01:18:33,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Better not.

1127
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:02,283
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to start to play some of this.

1128
01:19:19,861 --> 01:19:20,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1129
01:19:36,312 --> 01:19:40,514
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the game that made me import my Dreamcast.

1130
01:19:41,414 --> 01:19:44,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I wanted to play this that badly.

1131
01:19:44,915 --> 01:19:53,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it came out actually on December 23rd, 1998 in Japan.

1132
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:58,280
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was the first game in the Sonic Adventure series.

1133
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:01,521
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually...

1134
01:20:03,462 --> 01:20:06,485
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1135
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:23,960
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1136
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:45,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that the one in the Genesis?

1137
01:20:45,432 --> 01:20:50,838
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Sonic Jam was the Saturn release of all the Genesis and Game Gear and whatever versions.

1138
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:51,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, right.

1139
01:20:51,419 --> 01:20:53,801
[SPEAKER_10]: And it had a middle level that was all 3D.

1140
01:20:54,201 --> 01:20:55,823
[SPEAKER_10]: It had different missions and stuff.

1141
01:20:55,983 --> 01:21:00,628
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also Sonic 3D Blast was another one.

1142
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:06,574
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, in the... Uh, photo stages were...

1143
01:21:09,088 --> 01:21:09,488
[SPEAKER_10]: They were.

1144
01:21:09,628 --> 01:21:13,309
[SPEAKER_10]: They were in... Yeah, I guess they were in 3D-ish.

1145
01:21:13,809 --> 01:21:15,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Sonic 2's bonus stage was 3D.

1146
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:18,751
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they went into a 3D box.

1147
01:21:19,031 --> 01:21:24,412
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, you basically have your set levels and you play through with certain characters.

1148
01:21:24,872 --> 01:21:27,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, you've got Sonic, who is the main guy.

1149
01:21:28,213 --> 01:21:32,394
[SPEAKER_10]: You have Miles Tails Prower, which I think is cool too.

1150
01:21:33,694 --> 01:21:35,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you've got Knuckles and Echidna.

1151
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:45,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, I really, really, really, really would only ever play this game in Japanese because one of my favorite voice actors was, um, Knuckles' voice actor.

1152
01:21:45,165 --> 01:21:46,106
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a video I never watched.

1153
01:21:46,326 --> 01:21:49,328
[SPEAKER_10]: He was really cool.

1154
01:21:49,369 --> 01:21:50,810
[SPEAKER_10]: He also was a boxer on Macross 7.

1155
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:53,092
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like, I knew that voice!

1156
01:21:53,552 --> 01:21:54,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, oh, nerd-tastic.

1157
01:21:55,134 --> 01:21:57,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, there's also Amy Rose who beats shit with a hammer.

1158
01:21:59,037 --> 01:22:00,658
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Big the Cat, who fishes.

1159
01:22:01,778 --> 01:22:05,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, I got tired of hearin' fishin'.

1160
01:22:05,979 --> 01:22:08,820
[SPEAKER_10]: There's E-102 Gamma, which is the robot.

1161
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,621
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can play as Super Sonic once you've finished the game.

1162
01:22:12,941 --> 01:22:17,162
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course he's all gone all Super Saiyan or whatever.

1163
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:22,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've also got Eggman for your bad guys.

1164
01:22:22,464 --> 01:22:22,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Chaos...

1165
01:22:25,097 --> 01:22:27,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1166
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:44,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm saying Chao because I played it in Japanese first, so that's how they said it.

1167
01:22:45,901 --> 01:22:50,323
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're so cool.

1168
01:22:50,683 --> 01:22:52,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Who remembers the VMU, right?

1169
01:22:52,804 --> 01:23:00,608
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually download a virtual pet, the Alife system, and you can play Chao Adventure on your VMU.

1170
01:23:02,469 --> 01:23:07,131
[SPEAKER_10]: For people who played this on the GameCube, you would actually play it on your Game Boy Advance.

1171
01:23:07,711 --> 01:23:18,717
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you can raise your stats, and you actually can go into your little Chao house level or whatever, and play with them and see what they look like, and feed them coconuts, and do all kinds of bizarre crap with them.

1172
01:23:20,258 --> 01:23:26,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the other robots are in Gamma's story, which are the E-Series robots.

1173
01:23:29,202 --> 01:23:30,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Knights is in the game.

1174
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:46,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Night's is, um, if you're going into the, um, the Casinopolis, um, stage, there's actually a pinball area that's based on Night's, and when you go through the little special tunnel, you're flying through a Night's level.

1175
01:23:46,411 --> 01:23:47,132
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty cool.

1176
01:23:48,434 --> 01:23:48,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1177
01:23:51,255 --> 01:23:58,840
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's basically, there's some, I guess, degree of RPG element to it.

1178
01:23:58,941 --> 01:24:07,547
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, it's just that it really has an in-depth story and you find different things to advance your plot and just keep moving through it.

1179
01:24:07,567 --> 01:24:13,531
[SPEAKER_10]: But you've got your action stages and you've got your adventure levels, which is where I'm saying the RPG part of it comes into you.

1180
01:24:13,951 --> 01:24:15,953
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1181
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:35,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerds.

1182
01:24:50,572 --> 01:24:51,552
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, since this one came out.

1183
01:24:51,632 --> 01:24:56,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Sonic Adventure 2 was okay, but this one just had everything.

1184
01:24:56,874 --> 01:25:10,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, from the sound effects when, you know, you get your bubbles or your shoes and, you know, the ending music being the same when you step on the platform, being the ones that you release your little forest buddies out of, you know?

1185
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:16,818
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just really, really awesome.

1186
01:25:17,438 --> 01:25:19,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... Yes!

1187
01:25:19,859 --> 01:25:19,999
[SPEAKER_10]: See?

1188
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:23,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1189
01:25:44,594 --> 01:25:45,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut

1190
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:03,220
[SPEAKER_10]: is an enhanced version of it.

1191
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:12,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has a minigame collection where you actually can get 12 different Game Gear games.

1192
01:26:12,706 --> 01:26:28,517
[SPEAKER_10]: So you get Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Drift, Sonic Chaos, Sonic Labyrinth, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Spinball, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, which is another version of Puyo Puyo, Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic Drift 2, Tails Sky Patrol, Sonic Blast, and Tails Adventure.

1193
01:26:29,657 --> 01:26:29,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Done.

1194
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:31,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it?

1195
01:26:31,705 --> 01:26:32,046
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1196
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:32,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Check it out.

1197
01:26:32,626 --> 01:26:35,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast.

1198
01:26:35,287 --> 01:26:38,728
[SPEAKER_13]: And didn't they remake this game, put it out again, like on the GameCube or something?

1199
01:26:39,089 --> 01:26:39,929
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I was saying.

1200
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:40,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

1201
01:26:40,109 --> 01:26:41,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Talking about the GameCube version.

1202
01:26:41,209 --> 01:26:41,570
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1203
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1204
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:43,710
[SPEAKER_13]: There you have it.

1205
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:44,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Your classic game of the week.

1206
01:26:44,811 --> 01:26:46,832
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll have another one next week for you guys.

1207
01:26:46,852 --> 01:26:48,132
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, we're going to take a break.

1208
01:26:48,433 --> 01:26:52,594
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we come back, we have a little bit of news in Part B. But mostly you guys.

1209
01:26:52,634 --> 01:26:56,476
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be doing the mailbag and some quick calls tonight.

1210
01:26:57,597 --> 01:27:00,819
[SPEAKER_13]: and we also want you guys to do this during tonight's break.

1211
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,963
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be putting together the Orange Lounge Radio Top 3 Games of 2008.

1212
01:27:06,544 --> 01:27:10,587
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want to participate, all you need to do is send in your votes right now.

1213
01:27:11,248 --> 01:27:24,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Your Top 1, 2, and 3 game of 2008 using any criteria you want and I'll compile it all together during the break and we'll have ourselves a list that myself, DarkSakura, Loki, and maybe Brad, even though he said he didn't play anything this year,

1214
01:27:24,338 --> 01:27:28,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we can get them to think of three games, and we're going to do that, as well as a list list later tonight.

1215
01:27:29,405 --> 01:27:31,448
[SPEAKER_13]: So go ahead and send me those games, and we'll tally it up.

1216
01:27:31,488 --> 01:27:33,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Make sure you label it, though, one, two, and three.

1217
01:27:33,591 --> 01:27:37,596
[SPEAKER_13]: And don't send me other private messages, because they'll get lost amongst the other tabulation.

1218
01:27:38,057 --> 01:27:40,841
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll do that, and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1219
01:27:47,711 --> 01:27:48,151
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.com.

1220
01:28:08,579 --> 01:28:18,590
[SPEAKER_13]: So, anyhow, we got more news to get into, just a little bit, but then we're going to get into some year-end wrap-ups and talk about our favorite games of 2008, as well as the biggest stories of the year.

1221
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:20,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots and lots to talk about.

1222
01:28:20,592 --> 01:28:23,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's kick it off with a little bit more news from this week, though.

1223
01:28:23,155 --> 01:28:27,579
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a surprisingly busy week, considering it was a holiday and everything, but stuff going on, right, Loki?

1224
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:27,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1225
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:39,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, according to CNET, it looks like Microsoft is wanting to add to the user experience and design for the Zune group.

1226
01:28:39,842 --> 01:28:51,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to focus now on the Zune user interface, a Zune PC application used to access the Zune marketplace, and the Zune Xbox application.

1227
01:28:51,945 --> 01:28:53,805
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly is this application called?

1228
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:55,861
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1229
01:29:25,782 --> 01:29:26,983
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1230
01:29:40,967 --> 01:29:41,667
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1231
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:06,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Also interesting, this collaboration we're hearing about, it's a rumor, take this with a heavy grain of salt right now, but remember the game Deus Ex?

1232
01:30:06,523 --> 01:30:08,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember that game?

1233
01:30:08,704 --> 01:30:09,544
[SPEAKER_13]: They had like two games?

1234
01:30:10,425 --> 01:30:11,786
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I think there were two games in that series.

1235
01:30:13,046 --> 01:30:15,548
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I remember checking it out on GameTab a long, long, long time ago.

1236
01:30:17,982 --> 01:30:21,564
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole series was designed by this guy, Warren Spector.

1237
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:33,053
[SPEAKER_13]: What's very interesting, he said at one point, I guess way back in June 2007, that he was working on a new project and folks would tell him that he has sold out.

1238
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:36,355
[SPEAKER_13]: At least that's what hardcore gamers would say, that he sold out.

1239
01:30:36,735 --> 01:30:37,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently...

1240
01:30:39,511 --> 01:30:41,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Epic Mickey Mickey Mouse Mickey Mouse

1241
01:31:05,387 --> 01:31:05,847
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1242
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,260
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1243
01:31:58,928 --> 01:32:00,450
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1244
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:20,251
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68 says Mushroom Kingdom Hearts?

1245
01:32:20,872 --> 01:32:21,612
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a nice thought.

1246
01:32:22,092 --> 01:32:24,814
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe it's a Nintendo Wii game.

1247
01:32:25,175 --> 01:32:26,676
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you want to talk about selling out?

1248
01:32:27,456 --> 01:32:30,978
[SPEAKER_13]: This guy's making a game that involves Mickey and Mario on the Nintendo Wii.

1249
01:32:31,118 --> 01:32:33,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, could they do a Mario RPG 2?

1250
01:32:34,121 --> 01:32:34,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're talking.

1251
01:32:35,361 --> 01:32:35,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we're talking.

1252
01:32:35,942 --> 01:32:37,323
[SPEAKER_03]: But they can't do it without Square Enix.

1253
01:32:37,383 --> 01:32:39,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, because that would be epic fail.

1254
01:32:39,864 --> 01:32:44,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe it will be for the Nintendo Wii what Sony has for Kingdom Hearts, if that makes sense.

1255
01:32:44,988 --> 01:32:45,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1256
01:32:47,089 --> 01:32:47,930
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be interesting.

1257
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:49,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Could be interesting.

1258
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:56,054
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think there's a lot of in-between-the-line reading going on in this particular story.

1259
01:32:56,574 --> 01:32:59,316
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we ought to just wait until this guy decides to tell us what he's working on.

1260
01:32:59,536 --> 01:32:59,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Could be.

1261
01:33:00,637 --> 01:33:00,917
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1262
01:33:02,117 --> 01:33:04,999
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGuru in chat says, Mario and Mickey at the Olympic Games.

1263
01:33:06,764 --> 01:33:07,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Using any criteria we want.

1264
01:33:07,464 --> 01:33:09,125
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we don't like to say the top games of 2008.

1265
01:33:09,185 --> 01:33:10,465
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they're our favorite games of 2008.

1266
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Using any criteria we want.

1267
01:33:35,888 --> 01:33:38,649
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we want to put some game you think is crappy on there, too bad.

1268
01:33:38,689 --> 01:33:40,210
[SPEAKER_13]: It's our favorite games of 2008.

1269
01:33:40,410 --> 01:33:44,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Then I'll let you know what collectively is an OLR listenership we came up with.

1270
01:33:45,212 --> 01:33:50,795
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, what was your number three favorite... How appropriate, this music comes on just at the right time.

1271
01:33:51,355 --> 01:33:55,537
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you say was your number three favorite video game in the year 2008?

1272
01:33:56,677 --> 01:33:57,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock Band 2.

1273
01:33:57,818 --> 01:33:58,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Rock Band 2.

1274
01:33:59,058 --> 01:33:59,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Any particular reason why?

1275
01:34:01,959 --> 01:34:03,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I need to name them all?

1276
01:34:05,342 --> 01:34:05,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Really.

1277
01:34:06,302 --> 01:34:08,863
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just such a massive library.

1278
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:19,106
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, having the different instruments and everything, I just think it was... Even on top of that, you could import your list from the first Guitar Hero and it would all work.

1279
01:34:19,426 --> 01:34:20,126
[SPEAKER_13]: You mean Rock Band?

1280
01:34:20,226 --> 01:34:20,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Rock Band.

1281
01:34:20,546 --> 01:34:21,026
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1282
01:34:21,046 --> 01:34:21,486
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

1283
01:34:21,726 --> 01:34:23,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was actually... This brings me to my next point.

1284
01:34:23,767 --> 01:34:26,008
[SPEAKER_10]: The one thing that it did not have going for it is the guitars.

1285
01:34:26,648 --> 01:34:27,608
[SPEAKER_10]: The guitars suck.

1286
01:34:28,408 --> 01:34:30,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would only use the Guitar Hero guitars.

1287
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:37,243
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a game that narrowly missed being on my list, but I love this game.

1288
01:34:38,284 --> 01:34:40,786
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you think, though, compared to the first game?

1289
01:34:40,846 --> 01:34:46,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Because at first, when I first sat down with Rock Band 2, I was kind of like, eh, this feels like Rock Band 1.5.

1290
01:34:46,329 --> 01:34:50,332
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that might be part of the reason it didn't make my top three is because I do feel like it was an upgrade of what I played last year.

1291
01:34:50,992 --> 01:34:53,394
[SPEAKER_13]: But there is a lot of new, cool stuff.

1292
01:34:55,515 --> 01:35:01,138
[SPEAKER_10]: The multiplayer, when you make your band, you can actually save your character per your account.

1293
01:35:02,339 --> 01:35:04,040
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's a lot better.

1294
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:08,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it was really irritating going back to playing the first rock band over at my friend's house.

1295
01:35:09,183 --> 01:35:11,944
[SPEAKER_10]: And having to save my character on her profile.

1296
01:35:12,985 --> 01:35:13,805
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really irritating.

1297
01:35:15,146 --> 01:35:16,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, what was your number three favorite game of the year?

1298
01:35:18,318 --> 01:35:19,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, that's tough.

1299
01:35:19,859 --> 01:35:20,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me need it down.

1300
01:35:21,381 --> 01:35:22,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see.

1301
01:35:22,201 --> 01:35:24,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to try to be a little different here.

1302
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:25,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Lost Odyssey.

1303
01:35:26,444 --> 01:35:26,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1304
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:37,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Lost Odyssey this year was the only game that I feel is as close to Final Fantasy as we're going to have in a while until like Final Fantasy 13.

1305
01:35:38,013 --> 01:35:42,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, people thought maybe Last Remnant, maybe some of these other games that had come out.

1306
01:35:42,897 --> 01:35:43,017
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1307
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:43,077
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1308
01:35:43,823 --> 01:35:48,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Lost Odyssey is the closest thing you're going to get to Final Fantasy XIII until XIII comes out.

1309
01:35:48,886 --> 01:35:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: It plays exactly like a Final Fantasy game.

1310
01:35:50,627 --> 01:35:54,029
[SPEAKER_13]: And just even apart from the Final Fantasy series, it was a good game with a good story.

1311
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:56,311
[SPEAKER_13]: Another game that narrowly missed my top three.

1312
01:35:57,471 --> 01:35:57,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1313
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:00,053
[SPEAKER_13]: But I thought was still incredibly good.

1314
01:36:00,553 --> 01:36:01,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Any game I need to go back and finish.

1315
01:36:01,954 --> 01:36:04,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe part of the reason I didn't... Yes, I need to finish it too.

1316
01:36:04,736 --> 01:36:06,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only like a little ways into it.

1317
01:36:07,148 --> 01:36:07,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley, I have no idea.

1318
01:36:07,969 --> 01:36:08,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you make a top three list?

1319
01:36:08,949 --> 01:36:10,591
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you played enough games this year or what.

1320
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:14,393
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually thought of three games that came out this year that I actually played.

1321
01:36:14,513 --> 01:36:14,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent!

1322
01:36:15,014 --> 01:36:16,315
[SPEAKER_12]: What was your number three pick, Bradley?

1323
01:36:16,335 --> 01:36:17,155
[SPEAKER_12]: I have only three games.

1324
01:36:17,215 --> 01:36:20,838
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I've bought like one or two other that came out this year, but I didn't get around to playing them.

1325
01:36:21,158 --> 01:36:21,619
[SPEAKER_12]: That's alright.

1326
01:36:21,939 --> 01:36:29,925
[SPEAKER_12]: So, number three, at the bottom of the list I've played this year, but it's not bad, but it's just DDR, it's DDRX.

1327
01:36:31,225 --> 01:36:35,969
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've actually only played like a few hours of it, and the stories are weird, and

1328
01:36:37,031 --> 01:36:38,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, would they put stories in DDR?

1329
01:36:39,232 --> 01:36:41,232
[SPEAKER_12]: There's this weird thing.

1330
01:36:41,372 --> 01:36:43,613
[SPEAKER_12]: They have the different stories for characters.

1331
01:36:44,193 --> 01:36:53,215
[SPEAKER_12]: The first two characters, I think there's one or two characters that are unlocked at the beginning, which is, I think it's Emi, and there's a new guy named Zero.

1332
01:36:53,795 --> 01:36:58,657
[SPEAKER_12]: The Zero guy, he's just like the stoic sort of guy.

1333
01:36:58,677 --> 01:36:59,557
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't say very much.

1334
01:36:59,597 --> 01:37:01,057
[SPEAKER_12]: He's kind of, whatever.

1335
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:03,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of like a weird Bishonen-looking kind of guy.

1336
01:37:04,284 --> 01:37:05,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1337
01:37:13,858 --> 01:37:15,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Show off your moves.

1338
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:17,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds too much like you got served to me.

1339
01:37:18,302 --> 01:37:19,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's kind of silly.

1340
01:37:20,143 --> 01:37:20,483
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1341
01:37:20,863 --> 01:37:21,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know what, though?

1342
01:37:21,644 --> 01:37:30,070
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad DDR is represented somewhere on the list because we did start up as a Bomani-based radio station, so why not?

1343
01:37:31,351 --> 01:37:35,614
[SPEAKER_13]: My number three game that I would pick on the list of the top three games that were released in 2008...

1344
01:37:37,936 --> 01:37:38,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1345
01:37:59,938 --> 01:38:00,919
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.com.

1346
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:25,572
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, your number two favorite game of 2008.

1347
01:38:42,313 --> 01:38:47,896
[SPEAKER_10]: My number two game would be Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

1348
01:38:47,916 --> 01:38:49,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Any particular reason why?

1349
01:38:50,097 --> 01:38:56,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, it's freaking... I only really played as Ken and Jun because I'm the big Gatchaman fangirl.

1350
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,040
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's really cool.

1351
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,722
[SPEAKER_10]: It had actually so many different touches that...

1352
01:39:03,512 --> 01:39:09,935
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're fans of the old Tatsunoko series, it's just like big fangasm right then and there.

1353
01:39:10,396 --> 01:39:14,317
[SPEAKER_10]: So many good touches, except for the happy thumb ball of doom.

1354
01:39:15,398 --> 01:39:18,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I hated the happy thumb ball of doom, but the rest of it was pretty freaking fun.

1355
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:23,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like playing Marvel vs. Capcom in its control.

1356
01:39:23,942 --> 01:39:24,562
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really cool.

1357
01:39:27,824 --> 01:39:30,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Some folks in chat room are asking, was Rez HD really this year?

1358
01:39:31,005 --> 01:39:31,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it was January 30th.

1359
01:39:32,961 --> 01:39:33,341
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1360
01:39:34,182 --> 01:39:36,185
[SPEAKER_13]: It was early this year, but it was.

1361
01:39:36,685 --> 01:39:43,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, a game I didn't spend a whole lot of time with, but I was surprised at how decent it was.

1362
01:39:43,613 --> 01:39:45,715
[SPEAKER_13]: We were kind of all thinking, oh, this is going to be a little crappy.

1363
01:39:46,176 --> 01:39:46,776
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't thinking that.

1364
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:54,201
[SPEAKER_13]: The characters we knew were going to be good, but you know you've heard of projects like these and you go, oh boy.

1365
01:39:54,702 --> 01:39:56,242
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of like games based off movies.

1366
01:39:56,362 --> 01:39:58,604
[SPEAKER_13]: You're always kind of like, oh boy, these are going to kind of stink.

1367
01:39:58,924 --> 01:40:01,085
[SPEAKER_13]: But the game was surprisingly decent, so I can see that.

1368
01:40:02,045 --> 01:40:03,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, your number two game of the year.

1369
01:40:04,326 --> 01:40:08,568
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two game of the year... Man, that's tough.

1370
01:40:09,429 --> 01:40:14,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I would... I guess I'm just going to have to go with Saints Row 2.

1371
01:40:15,652 --> 01:40:16,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Saints Row 2.

1372
01:40:38,798 --> 01:40:54,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought a little bit better than or more fun for me than Grand Theft Auto 4 even though I still play Grand Theft Auto 4 today and that is pretty fun especially now that I can mod it but it was an overall fun game and I really can't wait for the next one to come out.

1373
01:40:55,205 --> 01:40:57,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Saints Row 3 in 2010, maybe.

1374
01:40:58,047 --> 01:40:58,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1375
01:40:59,508 --> 01:40:59,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

1376
01:41:00,448 --> 01:41:05,091
[SPEAKER_13]: We know you never shut up about that game on the show, so it's no surprise that it's showing up on your list, but that's cool.

1377
01:41:05,171 --> 01:41:06,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Sandbox games can be a lot of fun.

1378
01:41:07,332 --> 01:41:09,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley, number two, for you.

1379
01:41:09,453 --> 01:41:23,361
[SPEAKER_12]: This game had the unfortunate circumstance that I picked up a Zelda Phantom Hourglass and didn't get back to it, but since it's another game that I played this year, it's Sonic Chronicles The Dark Brotherhood.

1380
01:41:23,681 --> 01:41:24,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I only got through like

1381
01:41:24,841 --> 01:41:25,181
[SPEAKER_12]: SONIC CHRONICLES

1382
01:41:44,298 --> 01:41:45,879
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1383
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,668
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that whole games is art thing.

1384
01:42:10,889 --> 01:42:15,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the game just moves like a painting, has a surprisingly...

1385
01:42:16,721 --> 01:42:17,341
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

1386
01:42:46,019 --> 01:42:47,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.

1387
01:42:48,902 --> 01:42:51,644
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been pissing me the hell off, but I've been having the most fun with it.

1388
01:42:54,767 --> 01:42:59,192
[SPEAKER_10]: It gets back to what made Symphony of the Night fun.

1389
01:43:00,433 --> 01:43:03,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though that game frustrates me to no end, it was pretty cool.

1390
01:43:04,897 --> 01:43:07,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, your number one favorite game all freaking year.

1391
01:43:10,676 --> 01:43:21,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd normally go with Grand Theft Auto 4, but actually I'm going to have to say LittleBigPlanet, just because it was just a fun game.

1392
01:43:21,684 --> 01:43:28,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to really pick one game, but LittleBigPlanet, this is definitely a game I could see myself playing months from now.

1393
01:43:29,169 --> 01:43:31,971
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'll have to go with LittleBigPlanet.

1394
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:34,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, LittleBigPlanet.

1395
01:43:35,533 --> 01:43:38,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots to do in LittleBigPlanet, lots of replayability value.

1396
01:43:39,945 --> 01:43:41,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley, your number one favorite game of 2008.

1397
01:43:42,247 --> 01:43:47,910
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's actually not even maybe, not exactly a game, but it has games in it.

1398
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:51,973
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's what I actually have on my DS right now, playing.

1399
01:43:52,133 --> 01:43:53,434
[SPEAKER_12]: It's My Japanese Coach.

1400
01:43:54,074 --> 01:43:55,495
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll let it speak for itself.

1401
01:43:56,556 --> 01:43:57,036
Sugoi.

1402
01:43:57,716 --> 01:43:58,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugoi.

1403
01:43:58,177 --> 01:43:58,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugoi.

1404
01:43:59,117 --> 01:43:59,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugoi.

1405
01:44:00,638 --> 01:44:01,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugoi.

1406
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:02,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugoi.

1407
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:03,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugoi.

1408
01:44:05,751 --> 01:44:07,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, apparently it's amazing.

1409
01:44:07,513 --> 01:44:08,774
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I love about this show.

1410
01:44:08,834 --> 01:44:12,217
[SPEAKER_13]: You really can use any criteria you want.

1411
01:44:12,257 --> 01:44:16,341
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want to put My Japanese Coach as your number one game of the year, you go ahead.

1412
01:44:16,582 --> 01:44:17,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's good for learning.

1413
01:44:19,432 --> 01:44:21,394
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually recommend it if you want to learn Japanese.

1414
01:44:22,474 --> 01:44:29,538
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're just starting out, you probably want to have some help or get into a class, but this would also be good to help along.

1415
01:44:29,759 --> 01:44:35,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially it's good if you've forgotten a lot and need to get back in, get your skills back up.

1416
01:44:35,942 --> 01:44:37,683
[SPEAKER_13]: A shout out for the educational games.

1417
01:44:38,264 --> 01:44:38,624
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1418
01:44:39,685 --> 01:44:41,486
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, my number one game of the year.

1419
01:44:41,927 --> 01:44:42,307
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1420
01:44:42,327 --> 01:44:44,229
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been listening to the show long enough.

1421
01:44:44,469 --> 01:44:45,550
[SPEAKER_13]: You know me well enough.

1422
01:44:46,151 --> 01:44:46,732
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think?

1423
01:44:46,992 --> 01:44:48,133
[SPEAKER_13]: My number one game of the year.

1424
01:44:48,373 --> 01:44:49,054
[SPEAKER_13]: This shouldn't be hard.

1425
01:44:49,194 --> 01:44:50,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Metroid.

1426
01:44:51,637 --> 01:44:53,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe about 15 years ago, yes.

1427
01:44:54,279 --> 01:44:55,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Or number one game of all time, maybe.

1428
01:44:56,241 --> 01:44:57,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, I know you've got to know.

1429
01:44:58,964 --> 01:44:59,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing Star Abba.

1430
01:45:01,018 --> 01:45:01,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1431
01:45:17,706 --> 01:45:18,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Try again.

1432
01:45:18,366 --> 01:45:20,027
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm being serious, what do you think the number one?

1433
01:45:20,567 --> 01:45:21,307
[SPEAKER_13]: LittleBigPlanet?

1434
01:45:21,427 --> 01:45:22,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely right.

1435
01:45:22,287 --> 01:45:24,928
[SPEAKER_13]: LittleBigPlanet is my number one favorite game of 2008.

1436
01:45:25,628 --> 01:45:30,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think this game is amazing.

1437
01:45:30,289 --> 01:45:37,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Despite all the hubble we had about the moderation that went on earlier this year, I mean, God, I wouldn't even need half of that.

1438
01:45:39,071 --> 01:45:42,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Those user-created levels and the game itself, even by itself, is amazing.

1439
01:45:42,614 --> 01:45:44,435
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm having a wonderful time with it.

1440
01:45:44,995 --> 01:45:48,258
[SPEAKER_13]: And the potential that this game has for expansion is awesome.

1441
01:45:48,438 --> 01:45:51,060
[SPEAKER_13]: And now that they gave Sackboy a gun, it's even better.

1442
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,942
[SPEAKER_13]: And this game is amazing.

1443
01:45:55,022 --> 01:45:56,103
[SPEAKER_13]: So I love LittleBigPlanet.

1444
01:45:56,143 --> 01:45:57,144
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my number one game of the year.

1445
01:45:57,833 --> 01:45:58,793
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1446
01:46:16,061 --> 01:46:16,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the interesting thing.

1447
01:46:16,961 --> 01:46:26,685
[SPEAKER_13]: If we were to put our list together with the chat room, there would be a tie for the number one game of 2008 with LittleBigPlanet, because Loki and I naming it as number one game of the year probably helps.

1448
01:46:27,165 --> 01:46:27,726
[SPEAKER_13]: But get this.

1449
01:46:27,766 --> 01:46:28,966
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what the other number one game would be?

1450
01:46:28,986 --> 01:46:30,247
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be one none of us named.

1451
01:46:30,687 --> 01:46:32,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Mega Man 9 would be the game of the year.

1452
01:46:32,988 --> 01:46:33,588
[SPEAKER_08]: That's worthy.

1453
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:35,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Super Smash Bros.

1454
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:37,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Brawl, Rock Band 2

1455
01:46:58,143 --> 01:47:03,425
[SPEAKER_13]: So even though somebody named Rock Band 2, nobody named the other ones, and those were very well-loved amongst our listeners.

1456
01:47:03,505 --> 01:47:10,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Brawl, probably the Wii title to have this year, and Left 4 Dead, which, you know, as far as shooters go, has been pretty amazing.

1457
01:47:10,387 --> 01:47:13,348
[SPEAKER_13]: And then third place would be yet another one we didn't even name, Fallout 3.

1458
01:47:14,389 --> 01:47:23,312
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, obviously the topic of that's come up earlier in the show, and at least for me, that's one of those games that I'll get to it when it comes down in price a little later on after I finish these other games I want to play.

1459
01:47:25,871 --> 01:47:27,333
[SPEAKER_13]: So, there it is!

1460
01:47:28,134 --> 01:47:29,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Your favorite games of 2008.

1461
01:47:30,436 --> 01:47:33,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Very interesting to see some of the other things that people picked.

1462
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:40,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Castle Crashers, DJ Max, Wii Sports, somebody put in their list, even two years later, shows you the staying power of a game like that.

1463
01:47:41,128 --> 01:47:45,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Gears of War 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix, Fable 2, uh...

1464
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:58,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Castle Crashers, Tomb Raider, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Chrono Trigger DS, Bioshock, Mario Kart Wii, NHL 2009.

1465
01:47:58,828 --> 01:48:00,969
[SPEAKER_13]: The list goes on and on.

1466
01:48:02,511 --> 01:48:02,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.

1467
01:48:04,692 --> 01:48:06,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty good year for games overall?

1468
01:48:07,174 --> 01:48:07,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say so.

1469
01:48:08,775 --> 01:48:10,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say yes, unless you're the Nintendo Wii.

1470
01:48:10,937 --> 01:48:16,561
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the Nintendo Wii had maybe one or two great games on it, and the rest was shovelware, in my opinion.

1471
01:48:17,887 --> 01:48:19,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, was it a good year for games in 2008?

1472
01:48:19,488 --> 01:48:19,808
[SPEAKER_13]: It was okay.

1473
01:48:19,849 --> 01:48:21,630
[SPEAKER_13]: It was okay.

1474
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:25,873
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, let's see if it was a good year for the mailbag.

1475
01:48:26,293 --> 01:48:37,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Every week we invite you guys to send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com and we read some of your mail right here on this program in a little segment we appropriately call The Mailbag.

1476
01:48:44,367 --> 01:48:47,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've only got one email, just one.

1477
01:48:47,699 --> 01:48:49,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1478
01:49:09,349 --> 01:49:10,189
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen

1479
01:49:39,498 --> 01:49:45,348
[SPEAKER_10]: gave it a thumbs up or thumbs down and limited this to only the popular or big title games that came out.

1480
01:49:45,388 --> 01:49:50,656
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, I remember that Sky recently let LittleBigPlanet, but I can't remember what DarkSakura said about Animal Crossing.

1481
01:49:51,511 --> 01:49:52,792
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the same, by the way.

1482
01:49:53,992 --> 01:50:00,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if not all of you played the game, I still value each of your opinions because you guys never seem to lead me astray.

1483
01:50:00,576 --> 01:50:05,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not proposing an entire archive of what everyone nitpicked about every single aspect of each game.

1484
01:50:05,758 --> 01:50:11,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just looking for an easy and preferably online way to find out if you approved of a certain game before I go and get it.

1485
01:50:12,241 --> 01:50:13,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Just something to think about.

1486
01:50:13,302 --> 01:50:15,423
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope your holidays are awesome, Amplitude.

1487
01:50:15,964 --> 01:50:16,605
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time.

1488
01:50:33,784 --> 01:50:34,565
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1489
01:50:56,657 --> 01:51:13,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I will tell you this, that Sauce actually has a review blog that we've talked about some reviews on there before, but it's at Avengers-Tower.com, I think it is.

1490
01:51:14,925 --> 01:51:16,366
[SPEAKER_10]: and she puts up a lot of reviews there.

1491
01:51:17,526 --> 01:51:31,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually kind of thinking about getting back into blogging some game related stuff since I'm actually playing things a bit more and actually since I'm chatting with her she suggested get a Gamefly account too.

1492
01:51:33,057 --> 01:51:39,261
[SPEAKER_13]: If you guys know anyone who's really good at website design, and I mean really serious inquiries only... Oh, there's no Dash in that, by the way.

1493
01:51:39,782 --> 01:51:40,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Avengers Tower.

1494
01:51:40,842 --> 01:51:41,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Please send them my way.

1495
01:51:42,744 --> 01:51:50,909
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not talking about hosting or admin, because we have a guy who does that who is amazing, but I'm talking about the design itself of a website and being able to run it.

1496
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:55,953
[SPEAKER_13]: I would even be willing to throw money out there if it's not too extreme.

1497
01:51:56,053 --> 01:51:57,474
[SPEAKER_13]: So get in touch with me.

1498
01:51:57,894 --> 01:52:02,197
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of times, and maybe you've tried to before, but it fell through the cracks because we get a lot of freaking spam.

1499
01:52:02,677 --> 01:52:04,379
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'll try to keep my eye out over the next week.

1500
01:52:04,519 --> 01:52:12,707
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have ideas on how we can get OLR's website functional for types of requests like this, I would love to hear it.

1501
01:52:13,027 --> 01:52:17,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Because unfortunately, with a full-time job and school and stuff, we just got no time.

1502
01:52:18,012 --> 01:52:19,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Were we using WebMatter before?

1503
01:52:20,634 --> 01:52:23,136
[SPEAKER_13]: We're still using PHP Nuke, and it's an old system.

1504
01:52:23,156 --> 01:52:25,759
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I meant for our old blog that we used to have.

1505
01:52:26,398 --> 01:52:27,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Old blog?

1506
01:52:27,338 --> 01:52:30,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, remember the blog that we had up way back in the day?

1507
01:52:30,039 --> 01:52:30,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God, yeah.

1508
01:52:30,379 --> 01:52:31,920
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was called Grey Matter or something like that.

1509
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:32,960
[SPEAKER_13]: That was old.

1510
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:37,641
[SPEAKER_13]: We could probably throw up WordPress easy, but I don't know.

1511
01:52:37,661 --> 01:52:38,802
[SPEAKER_10]: WordPress was what we used.

1512
01:52:40,622 --> 01:52:43,643
[SPEAKER_10]: We could just try reviving that, too, but...

1513
01:52:44,127 --> 01:52:46,629
[SPEAKER_13]: PhpNuke We just need a website that looks less less

1514
01:53:09,848 --> 01:53:11,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Our strength is radio, guys.

1515
01:53:11,469 --> 01:53:12,609
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the thing you've got to learn.

1516
01:53:13,309 --> 01:53:15,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Radio is what we've done for seven years, not website design.

1517
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:18,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I can update PHPBB, so don't worry about that.

1518
01:53:19,451 --> 01:53:20,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I did my own board.

1519
01:53:21,031 --> 01:53:21,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1520
01:53:23,012 --> 01:53:28,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to give it a refresh just to see, but you know what?

1521
01:53:29,434 --> 01:53:29,774
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1522
01:53:30,414 --> 01:53:30,714
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1523
01:53:31,794 --> 01:53:32,294
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all right.

1524
01:53:32,314 --> 01:53:33,175
[SPEAKER_10]: How dare they?

1525
01:53:33,215 --> 01:53:38,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably because I've been very behind on updating the podcast again and, you know, oops.

1526
01:53:39,463 --> 01:53:43,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I will resolve in the new year to get us all caught up in current again.

1527
01:53:44,689 --> 01:53:45,670
[SPEAKER_13]: So, hooray.

1528
01:53:46,551 --> 01:53:49,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's move on with a couple more news stories.

1529
01:53:49,414 --> 01:53:49,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a couple.

1530
01:53:49,834 --> 01:53:51,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we're going to do Listless tonight.

1531
01:53:51,136 --> 01:53:52,337
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't done Listless in forever.

1532
01:53:52,657 --> 01:53:53,298
[SPEAKER_13]: This will be fun.

1533
01:53:54,139 --> 01:53:54,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Listless tonight.

1534
01:53:56,189 --> 01:53:57,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Top three news stories of 2008.

1535
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:01,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Top three news stories will be tonight's list list.

1536
01:54:01,692 --> 01:54:02,172
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be fun.

1537
01:54:02,212 --> 01:54:03,813
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be quick, too, because there's only three of us.

1538
01:54:04,033 --> 01:54:04,994
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we got Skype, too.

1539
01:54:05,054 --> 01:54:05,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry.

1540
01:54:05,614 --> 01:54:06,194
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have Skype.

1541
01:54:06,594 --> 01:54:07,435
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have plenty of time for that.

1542
01:54:08,635 --> 01:54:09,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, news.

1543
01:54:10,424 --> 01:54:12,185
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1544
01:54:30,005 --> 01:54:34,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the financial situation that they're in and that kind of stuff.

1545
01:54:34,126 --> 01:54:42,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And their forecasts that they're going to not really continue development on it.

1546
01:54:43,008 --> 01:54:46,529
[SPEAKER_03]: The current market environment and the forecasts for the future.

1547
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:50,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they apologize to everybody that was waiting for the release.

1548
01:54:52,031 --> 01:54:52,511
[SPEAKER_13]: But too bad.

1549
01:54:52,932 --> 01:55:01,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think this was a game that they were showing off, I want to say, either the very first year of 360 came out, or maybe a little bit after.

1550
01:55:01,716 --> 01:55:11,020
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically, what was it, a team that composed of Miss Walker and R-Toon.

1551
01:55:12,101 --> 01:55:12,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1552
01:55:14,213 --> 01:55:15,755
[SPEAKER_13]: What's Mistwalker been working on lately?

1553
01:55:16,495 --> 01:55:18,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Are they doing Lost Odyssey 2 and Blue Dragon 2?

1554
01:55:18,177 --> 01:55:20,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a Blue Dragon DS game.

1555
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:20,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

1556
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:23,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some other Mistwalker game that's coming out.

1557
01:55:23,803 --> 01:55:25,485
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working on a few things, I remember.

1558
01:55:25,825 --> 01:55:27,827
[SPEAKER_13]: They've already confirmed a sequel to Lost Odyssey, though, right?

1559
01:55:29,127 --> 01:55:29,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they did.

1560
01:55:30,267 --> 01:55:30,748
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they did.

1561
01:55:31,508 --> 01:55:31,788
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1562
01:55:32,789 --> 01:55:33,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, follow-up, too.

1563
01:55:33,789 --> 01:55:36,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember last week, we just had depression upon depression.

1564
01:55:36,410 --> 01:55:38,751
[SPEAKER_13]: All these studios were closing left and right.

1565
01:55:39,551 --> 01:55:43,293
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of them were rumor status, and one of those was Free Radical.

1566
01:55:44,033 --> 01:55:52,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, it has been confirmed that as of December 31st, Free Radical is going to be downsizing significantly.

1567
01:55:53,577 --> 01:55:55,758
[SPEAKER_13]: 75% of its workforce, 140 employees.

1568
01:55:56,138 --> 01:55:57,879
[SPEAKER_13]: That means only 40 people will be left.

1569
01:55:58,419 --> 01:55:59,500
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1570
01:56:25,635 --> 01:56:34,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, just the countless news upon news articles of studios shutting their doors is just one of the big things that happened in 2008.

1571
01:56:34,984 --> 01:56:43,472
[SPEAKER_13]: But we thought we would take a look tonight at some of the top stories of 2008, the way that only we can do it here on Orange Lounge Radio in a segment we call...

1572
01:56:48,462 --> 01:56:48,902
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

1573
01:56:49,062 --> 01:56:54,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Here on Orange Launch Radio, we do a segment called Listless, where we invite everybody to submit their top three... I'm sorry, we don't invite everybody.

1574
01:56:54,967 --> 01:57:03,153
[SPEAKER_13]: We invite the hosts to submit their top three, and then we have the chatroom vote on the list that is prepared, and come up with the ultimate list.

1575
01:57:03,253 --> 01:57:06,735
[SPEAKER_13]: And today's topic is the top three stories of 2008.

1576
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:14,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, what's interesting tonight is that I don't believe Bradley is going to be able to participate, because I don't think he's been following enough stories this year to be able to tell us.

1577
01:57:14,301 --> 01:57:15,082
[SPEAKER_13]: He's shaking his head no, so...

1578
01:57:15,822 --> 01:57:17,203
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

1579
01:57:38,536 --> 01:57:39,797
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1580
01:57:57,170 --> 01:58:00,693
[SPEAKER_13]: He who shall not be named loses his license to practice law in Florida, correct?

1581
01:58:00,733 --> 01:58:00,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1582
01:58:01,293 --> 01:58:01,793
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1583
01:58:02,314 --> 01:58:07,998
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a pretty monumentous occasion that involved confetti being tossed and hoorays everywhere.

1584
01:58:08,878 --> 01:58:09,139
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1585
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:12,141
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Dark Knight says, let the chatters kick one out.

1586
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:13,342
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1587
01:58:13,642 --> 01:58:16,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Should we let the chatters maybe put like one thing on the list so we have a nice even ten?

1588
01:58:17,465 --> 01:58:17,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1589
01:58:18,085 --> 01:58:18,385
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1590
01:58:19,706 --> 01:58:20,247
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do this.

1591
01:58:20,347 --> 01:58:24,390
[SPEAKER_13]: At a certain time, I'm going to open up the Skype line and we'll let you guys put one thing on the list.

1592
01:58:25,771 --> 01:58:26,071
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1593
01:58:27,028 --> 01:58:28,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you're number three.

1594
01:58:28,929 --> 01:58:29,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, that's tough.

1595
01:58:33,291 --> 01:58:37,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess because we talked a lot about it.

1596
01:58:41,836 --> 01:58:46,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it would be funny if Rock Revolution, Konami announcing that they're doing Rock Revolution.

1597
01:58:47,219 --> 01:58:48,719
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was actually the year before last.

1598
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:49,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was that this year?

1599
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:50,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

1600
01:58:52,148 --> 01:58:55,289
[SPEAKER_13]: This E3 was the one where they really botched it publicly.

1601
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:58,031
[SPEAKER_13]: You might remember, so maybe you want to use that.

1602
01:58:58,051 --> 01:58:59,291
[SPEAKER_13]: No, take that up, take that up.

1603
01:58:59,331 --> 01:58:59,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.

1604
01:58:59,991 --> 01:59:02,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo fucking up their E3 press conference.

1605
01:59:07,615 --> 01:59:08,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Care to elaborate?

1606
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:14,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, their demonstration of Wii music and how it butchered the Super Mario Bros.

1607
01:59:14,417 --> 01:59:14,758
[SPEAKER_03]: theme.

1608
01:59:16,718 --> 01:59:19,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Stories about snowboarding and Sun's...

1609
01:59:23,141 --> 01:59:28,562
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the other thing that they showed that was really crappy?

1610
01:59:29,483 --> 01:59:31,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Animal Crossing and how it wasn't different.

1611
01:59:31,683 --> 01:59:35,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, GameGuru in the chatroom asked a question a lot of people are going to ask you.

1612
01:59:35,284 --> 01:59:35,464
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1613
01:59:35,524 --> 01:59:35,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck up.

1614
01:59:36,305 --> 01:59:37,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people would say they did not fuck up.

1615
01:59:38,825 --> 01:59:40,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, disappointing showing at E3.

1616
01:59:42,346 --> 01:59:44,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly they had the worst press conference.

1617
01:59:44,387 --> 01:59:50,449
[SPEAKER_03]: They were supposed to make this big splash to kind of come back for ignoring the core gamer and

1618
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:53,960
[SPEAKER_03]: They pretty much ignore the core gamer.

1619
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:57,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we said anything you want.

1620
01:59:58,834 --> 02:00:00,895
[SPEAKER_13]: TigerCross says, how about the drummer pretending to drum?

1621
02:00:00,935 --> 02:00:02,717
[SPEAKER_13]: So you do have some allies in your corner there.

1622
02:00:04,017 --> 02:00:13,644
[SPEAKER_13]: My number three that I would put on the list, I would say the story, and I don't know if you remember this, but part of the reason I'm putting it on the list is because of the endless lulls that it brought us on this show.

1623
02:00:14,184 --> 02:00:18,147
[SPEAKER_13]: But do you remember when a website called WhatTheyPlay.com ran a poll?

1624
02:00:18,887 --> 02:00:28,514
[SPEAKER_13]: And this poll discovered that people out there are more offended by sex and gay kissing than multiple uses of the word fuck and disembodied heads.

1625
02:00:29,054 --> 02:00:31,235
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll see you next time.

1626
02:00:50,883 --> 02:00:51,523
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

1627
02:01:23,442 --> 02:01:23,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1628
02:01:47,091 --> 02:01:49,113
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got a free write-off of them, huh?

1629
02:01:49,433 --> 02:01:52,776
[SPEAKER_13]: And easiest way to get some of those achievements because the song is so short.

1630
02:01:53,878 --> 02:01:54,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Just want to point that out.

1631
02:01:56,140 --> 02:01:59,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, your number two top news story of 2008.

1632
02:02:00,344 --> 02:02:03,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it was funny to make fun of how ridiculous everything was getting.

1633
02:02:04,367 --> 02:02:05,909
[SPEAKER_03]: The Little Big Planet Controversy.

1634
02:02:06,409 --> 02:02:10,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, a song with lyrics that most people won't understand.

1635
02:02:12,071 --> 02:02:13,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't possibly get offended by them.

1636
02:02:14,412 --> 02:02:15,552
[SPEAKER_13]: What was up with that?

1637
02:02:15,632 --> 02:02:21,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, seriously, the guy had won Grammys and does this stuff all his time in his albums and nobody had ever had a problem with it before.

1638
02:02:21,474 --> 02:02:26,995
[SPEAKER_13]: And even the guy who complained about it was like, I didn't mean to, like, recall the game.

1639
02:02:27,095 --> 02:02:28,896
[SPEAKER_13]: You could have just, like, patched it out.

1640
02:02:28,916 --> 02:02:29,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Panic!

1641
02:02:29,396 --> 02:02:29,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Panic!

1642
02:02:30,056 --> 02:02:30,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Panic!

1643
02:02:30,456 --> 02:02:30,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Panic!

1644
02:02:30,876 --> 02:02:31,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Panic!

1645
02:02:34,157 --> 02:02:35,578
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the new motto at Sony.

1646
02:02:35,618 --> 02:02:37,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Whenever we talk about Sony headquarters, Panic!

1647
02:02:37,718 --> 02:02:38,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Panic!

1648
02:02:38,098 --> 02:02:38,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Panic!

1649
02:02:38,699 --> 02:02:38,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Panic!

1650
02:02:41,007 --> 02:02:42,869
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right, the crayon eating leads to panicking.

1651
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:46,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think that maybe there's some chemical in, like, the crayon that causes people to panic?

1652
02:02:48,393 --> 02:02:49,374
[SPEAKER_13]: I've died in before!

1653
02:02:51,856 --> 02:02:58,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, my number two was going to also be the news story about Nintendo burning their hardcore gamers at E3.

1654
02:02:58,982 --> 02:03:00,523
[SPEAKER_13]: But since Loki stole that...

1655
02:03:02,986 --> 02:03:08,971
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say the news that E4ALL got canned and Old E3 is coming back.

1656
02:03:09,391 --> 02:03:13,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think it goes to show a lot of people said, it wouldn't work, it wouldn't work.

1657
02:03:14,015 --> 02:03:19,078
[SPEAKER_13]: And as much as they're trying to say, well, you know, we tried something different, da-da-da, it didn't work.

1658
02:03:19,939 --> 02:03:22,941
[SPEAKER_13]: So Old E3 is returning, is my number two story of 2008.

1659
02:03:23,762 --> 02:03:25,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Old E3 returning, bye-bye E4ALL.

1660
02:03:26,043 --> 02:03:29,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Where did E4ALL not work out, do you guys think?

1661
02:03:30,046 --> 02:03:30,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything?

1662
02:03:32,225 --> 02:03:42,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it was a good concept, but because there was already this expectation of what was there before, it really did rub raw with a lot in the community.

1663
02:03:43,636 --> 02:03:54,607
[SPEAKER_10]: And really, I think, a lot of the hype was really, really brought up at the big E3 orgy.

1664
02:03:54,707 --> 02:03:56,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, it was the orgy of game.

1665
02:03:57,129 --> 02:04:00,590
[SPEAKER_10]: So that really actually cut down a lot of advertising for them, I thought.

1666
02:04:00,750 --> 02:04:03,371
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a Target booth where you could buy games.

1667
02:04:03,591 --> 02:04:08,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, where will we find a Target on, I don't know, anywhere in the United States?

1668
02:04:09,732 --> 02:04:11,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, no, they're everywhere, that's right.

1669
02:04:11,833 --> 02:04:15,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, of course you need to go to E4ALL to go buy your games.

1670
02:04:16,924 --> 02:04:21,709
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGuru wants to point out in chat that Capcom, he believes, was the worst at E3.

1671
02:04:22,149 --> 02:04:23,871
[SPEAKER_13]: At least Nintendo talked about actual games.

1672
02:04:24,051 --> 02:04:24,792
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good point.

1673
02:04:24,812 --> 02:04:30,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Capcom got up there and sucked their own dicks for an hour, basically, is what they did.

1674
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:37,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Which you'd think would be an impressive thing to watch, but in fact it was really boring.

1675
02:04:38,186 --> 02:04:38,766
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1676
02:04:58,544 --> 02:05:01,125
[SPEAKER_03]: GameGuru says E3 is for the casual gamer and movie lover now.

1677
02:05:25,851 --> 02:05:28,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, do you think having to go back to the old way?

1678
02:05:28,112 --> 02:05:28,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Somewhat.

1679
02:05:28,433 --> 02:05:31,274
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we say it the old way, although they say we're going to cap it at $40,000.

1680
02:05:31,334 --> 02:05:34,376
[SPEAKER_13]: They say they're going to make it easier for podcasters to get in.

1681
02:05:34,796 --> 02:05:37,178
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm saying, I'll believe it when I see it.

1682
02:05:37,898 --> 02:05:39,119
[SPEAKER_13]: That's some bullshit right there.

1683
02:05:40,039 --> 02:05:44,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe other podcasters that have done... Why podcasters if you're an IGN podcaster?

1684
02:05:45,042 --> 02:05:45,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1685
02:05:45,342 --> 02:05:46,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, they have, like,

1686
02:05:46,443 --> 02:05:47,003
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1687
02:06:15,549 --> 02:06:22,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I promised that we would allow a listener to add something to the list, so we're going to the Skype line right now.

1688
02:06:22,162 --> 02:06:22,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's on the line?

1689
02:06:23,865 --> 02:06:24,907
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Aki Ripper!

1690
02:06:24,987 --> 02:06:25,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Aki Ripper!

1691
02:06:26,009 --> 02:06:27,031
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you doing, my friend?

1692
02:06:28,474 --> 02:06:29,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing just fine.

1693
02:06:30,094 --> 02:06:30,454
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1694
02:06:30,494 --> 02:06:35,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the small, tiny detail that what the hell do I have to add to this?

1695
02:06:39,156 --> 02:06:40,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you got through.

1696
02:06:40,836 --> 02:06:45,877
[SPEAKER_13]: You called when I said to call and chat, and I said a chat room person could add one item to the list.

1697
02:06:46,157 --> 02:06:47,898
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are about to start our number ones.

1698
02:06:48,278 --> 02:06:52,639
[SPEAKER_13]: So Aki Ripper, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?

1699
02:06:52,859 --> 02:06:53,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Any criteria you want.

1700
02:06:54,813 --> 02:07:04,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the only thing I can think of at the straight really is the dissemination of that one who shall not be named.

1701
02:07:05,597 --> 02:07:08,918
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I fail per automatic, sorry.

1702
02:07:09,159 --> 02:07:13,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, yeah, and that's already on the list, so you're not gonna try and add something new to the list?

1703
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:14,601
[SPEAKER_13]: What would number two be?

1704
02:07:17,542 --> 02:07:23,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm... I really gotta be... I am so really behind, and...

1705
02:07:24,639 --> 02:07:25,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Gua!

1706
02:07:27,861 --> 02:07:29,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Pardon me, I just failed.

1707
02:07:29,122 --> 02:07:31,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Was there a game called Gua that was released this year?

1708
02:07:33,565 --> 02:07:35,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Guar is a band, I know that.

1709
02:07:35,747 --> 02:07:37,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Ake Ripper.

1710
02:07:38,129 --> 02:07:38,949
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have to let you go.

1711
02:07:39,029 --> 02:07:39,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Call back later.

1712
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:40,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

1713
02:07:40,831 --> 02:07:41,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1714
02:07:43,152 --> 02:07:44,473
[SPEAKER_13]: People so excited to call in.

1715
02:07:44,894 --> 02:07:45,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1716
02:07:45,894 --> 02:07:46,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1717
02:07:48,066 --> 02:07:48,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Jason.

1718
02:07:48,747 --> 02:07:49,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Jason.

1719
02:07:49,688 --> 02:07:50,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Jason.

1720
02:07:50,288 --> 02:07:50,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Jason.

1721
02:07:50,689 --> 02:07:51,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Jason.

1722
02:07:51,169 --> 02:07:51,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Jason.

1723
02:08:10,259 --> 02:08:11,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry, technical difficulties.

1724
02:08:11,700 --> 02:08:12,061
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1725
02:08:12,301 --> 02:08:13,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Jason, that's good news for you.

1726
02:08:13,582 --> 02:08:15,864
[SPEAKER_13]: That means you can put on whatever you want onto the list.

1727
02:08:15,904 --> 02:08:19,767
[SPEAKER_13]: So what do you think was the top news story of 2008 in gaming?

1728
02:08:19,987 --> 02:08:23,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be a little bit egotistical with this one because of how everything went out.

1729
02:08:24,011 --> 02:08:27,894
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Metal Gear Solid will be an iPhone game.

1730
02:08:29,235 --> 02:08:31,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, so something a little recently here.

1731
02:08:31,597 --> 02:08:31,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1732
02:08:32,338 --> 02:08:34,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do you think this is such a big freaking deal?

1733
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:37,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me one moment so I'm not echoing all over the place.

1734
02:08:38,783 --> 02:08:40,504
[SPEAKER_13]: You sound fine to us here in the studio, just so you know.

1735
02:08:41,164 --> 02:08:44,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you said that, but... You sound like a tin can, but you sound fine.

1736
02:08:46,587 --> 02:08:52,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I chose that simply for the fact that people went absolutely crazy about Metal Gear Solid V, holy crap!

1737
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:54,591
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already gotten Portable Ops.

1738
02:08:54,811 --> 02:08:57,572
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already gotten, what was it, Metal Gear Acid?

1739
02:08:57,612 --> 02:08:58,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I even thinking about the right game?

1740
02:08:59,273 --> 02:09:01,214
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already got Portable games, we've already got offshoots.

1741
02:09:01,774 --> 02:09:04,116
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 just came out, and they were really trying to end the series.

1742
02:09:04,916 --> 02:09:06,377
[SPEAKER_04]: The I in the logo...

1743
02:09:08,106 --> 02:09:11,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Just prime over-analyticalness, that's why.

1744
02:09:14,571 --> 02:09:17,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know what's interesting is it's not just Metal Gear that Konami's putting on the phone.

1745
02:09:17,574 --> 02:09:29,863
[SPEAKER_13]: If I recall, they also announced DDR and some of their other big franchises on iPhone, so to me this is more of a story about that iPhone is starting to legitimately become a gaming platform of sorts, as much to Loki's dismay.

1746
02:09:31,024 --> 02:09:32,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Konami Mobile, yeah, that sounds about right.

1747
02:09:33,547 --> 02:09:36,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they already had cell phone games, so that's a gimme, I'm sorry.

1748
02:09:37,128 --> 02:09:41,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not Metal Gear, hence my real reliance right on that.

1749
02:09:41,450 --> 02:09:41,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1750
02:09:42,291 --> 02:09:44,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but this isn't really a good Metal Gear game anyways.

1751
02:09:45,912 --> 02:09:48,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Some interesting comments in chat.

1752
02:09:48,513 --> 02:09:50,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Bob Copy says Metal Gear Touch will fail.

1753
02:09:50,854 --> 02:09:53,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Pitstun says Metal Gear Touch is a glorified light gun game.

1754
02:09:53,755 --> 02:09:56,316
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGuru says Metal Gear Solid Touch should be on Wii.

1755
02:09:57,197 --> 02:09:58,757
[SPEAKER_13]: So should the Silent Hill arcade game.

1756
02:09:59,097 --> 02:09:59,838
[SPEAKER_13]: That should be on Wii.

1757
02:10:00,818 --> 02:10:06,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well Jason, thank you so much for contributing to the list and we'll see what happens if the chat room votes that it's one of the top three.

1758
02:10:06,783 --> 02:10:07,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah, you guys better.

1759
02:10:08,024 --> 02:10:08,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we'll see.

1760
02:10:09,025 --> 02:10:09,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

1761
02:10:09,866 --> 02:10:10,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1762
02:10:10,827 --> 02:10:15,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's go around and get our in-studio, our number one picks for biggest news story of 2008.

1763
02:10:15,731 --> 02:10:18,894
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, what would you say was the biggest news story of 2008?

1764
02:10:20,055 --> 02:10:21,236
[SPEAKER_10]: The biggest news story?

1765
02:10:21,456 --> 02:10:24,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd actually say our pair of anniversaries.

1766
02:10:25,379 --> 02:10:25,880
[SPEAKER_13]: How so?

1767
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:27,181
[SPEAKER_10]: For the station, seriously.

1768
02:10:30,048 --> 02:10:31,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Any criteria you want.

1769
02:10:31,168 --> 02:10:37,813
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really big for us because we not only hit 300 episodes, but we hit six years.

1770
02:10:38,853 --> 02:10:40,715
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd say that's fairly monumental.

1771
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,700
[SPEAKER_10]: We're that bored.

1772
02:10:46,861 --> 02:10:58,585
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I don't know if there is another, and if I am mistaken, please feel free to correct me, but I don't think there is another show that runs weekly that has hit 300 episodes in the history of the internet.

1773
02:10:59,285 --> 02:10:59,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Of gaming.

1774
02:11:00,786 --> 02:11:01,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, DarkSakura,

1775
02:11:28,866 --> 02:11:29,727
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so true, though.

1776
02:11:30,128 --> 02:11:34,214
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, no, you know, we do it because, you know, what else would we do?

1777
02:11:34,674 --> 02:11:35,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Crack?

1778
02:11:36,397 --> 02:11:36,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki!

1779
02:11:37,691 --> 02:11:45,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since that was going to be my number one Winners don't use drugs But that was going to be my number one because I did dress up like a sack boy then That was going to be your number one, really?

1780
02:11:45,815 --> 02:12:03,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Micah, y'all are getting Capcom on me Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen I have a better number one though because this small event happened In May of 2008, Activision announced that Guitar Hero, which became Guitar Hero World Tour, would now have drums

1781
02:12:05,689 --> 02:12:07,131
[SPEAKER_03]: and would now be copying Rock Band.

1782
02:12:07,532 --> 02:12:16,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be the first music game in the history of music games to have drums and guitars in the same game.

1783
02:12:16,706 --> 02:12:18,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, except that's inaccurate.

1784
02:12:18,548 --> 02:12:19,530
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what they said.

1785
02:12:20,411 --> 02:12:20,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something like that.

1786
02:12:22,484 --> 02:12:33,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, meaning, like, how, uh, they got up there, I think, and said, like, this is the first time you're gonna be able to get to play the guitar and play the drums and sing at the same time, all in one game.

1787
02:12:33,506 --> 02:12:36,807
[SPEAKER_13]: And everybody's just thinking, like, uh, lol, rock band.

1788
02:12:37,127 --> 02:12:39,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think they meant in the Guitar Hero series, but, yeah.

1789
02:12:40,007 --> 02:12:42,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but, you know, you know how them suits are.

1790
02:12:43,988 --> 02:12:46,908
[SPEAKER_13]: They like to think that we're all ignorant, which is not true.

1791
02:12:47,868 --> 02:12:48,068
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

1792
02:12:48,829 --> 02:12:50,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, uh, my number one, I mean...

1793
02:12:51,954 --> 02:12:56,618
[SPEAKER_13]: I decided to pick something I actually think is the number one thing that happened this year in gaming.

1794
02:12:56,658 --> 02:13:01,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, huge news, I think, that changes gaming in a big, big way.

1795
02:13:02,102 --> 02:13:06,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And do you guys remember I've been talking about something that I said was going to be huge for gaming?

1796
02:13:06,665 --> 02:13:11,368
[SPEAKER_13]: It was announced early in the year and then happened, and I'm saying it's going to be like the YouTube of the 360.

1797
02:13:11,629 --> 02:13:12,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Singstaraba?

1798
02:13:13,030 --> 02:13:14,411
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not Singstaraba!

1799
02:13:16,312 --> 02:13:18,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Community games on the new Xbox Experience.

1800
02:13:18,994 --> 02:13:20,415
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that they brought in community games.

1801
02:13:20,495 --> 02:13:21,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Not just that!

1802
02:13:21,877 --> 02:13:35,585
[SPEAKER_13]: But Netflix, so I'm going to kind of loop it all in and say the new Xbox experience I think is the biggest news story of 2008 because it brought us not just the community games and the, you know, web 2.0-age of my 360, but the fact that I can freaking stream movies to my 360.

1803
02:13:36,626 --> 02:13:39,567
[SPEAKER_13]: That just bumped up its entertainment capacity by a ton.

1804
02:13:39,907 --> 02:13:40,388
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

1805
02:13:40,448 --> 02:13:47,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Not just a gaming system, but a movie hub, you know, an entertainment system, really.

1806
02:13:47,352 --> 02:13:50,434
[SPEAKER_13]: So, NXT is my number one story of 2008.

1807
02:13:53,547 --> 02:14:01,596
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to specifically state it's because of community games and Netflix and not necessarily because of stuff that was just to kind of catch up to other companies like the avatars.

1808
02:14:01,656 --> 02:14:08,264
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, there are some things about NXT I don't like, but I do think those two particular aspects make it very, very relevant.

1809
02:14:09,585 --> 02:14:12,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I know you would think SingStar ABBA would be there.

1810
02:14:12,108 --> 02:14:13,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe if I got to do a top five, I don't know.

1811
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:15,590
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1812
02:14:17,351 --> 02:14:21,452
[SPEAKER_13]: So, since we're skipping an elimination round this time, you guys get to vote on this as it is right here.

1813
02:14:21,472 --> 02:14:24,933
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to post this in the chat room there, and you can send in your votes.

1814
02:14:25,173 --> 02:14:26,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Prepare for fluttage in chat.

1815
02:14:27,854 --> 02:14:28,154
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1816
02:14:28,495 --> 02:14:34,297
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you can place a vote for your number one and your number two picks in the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1817
02:14:34,337 --> 02:14:35,917
[SPEAKER_13]: These were the top ones.

1818
02:14:36,417 --> 02:14:37,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Jack Thompson getting the beat down.

1819
02:14:38,398 --> 02:14:41,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo fucks up the E3 press conference, as Loki said, fucked up.

1820
02:14:42,299 --> 02:14:43,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Whattheyplay.com asshattery.

1821
02:14:44,920 --> 02:15:07,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Steven Colbert is in Rock Band LittleBigPlanet, Koran Lyrics and The Controversy Notice that's Koran, not Korean Old E3 is coming back by E4ALL Metal Gear goes to iPhone OLR hits 300 episodes in 6 years I love how that's mixed in with all these other stories Guitar Hero announces drums and NXE Community Game and Netflix

1822
02:15:08,647 --> 02:15:09,488
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you have it.

1823
02:15:09,588 --> 02:15:15,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Send your number one and number two picks via private message to Sky in the chat room.

1824
02:15:15,371 --> 02:15:17,813
[SPEAKER_13]: While you do that, we have some more news for you guys.

1825
02:15:17,833 --> 02:15:19,034
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get to the results shortly.

1826
02:15:19,114 --> 02:15:20,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Please hurry and get those in.

1827
02:15:20,835 --> 02:15:21,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, we'll start off with you.

1828
02:15:22,216 --> 02:15:23,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1829
02:15:23,857 --> 02:15:32,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of games with guitars and drums, Rock Band 2 for the Wii is finally going to get some download content.

1830
02:15:32,762 --> 02:15:38,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting in early 2009, they're going to be, I guess, adding that feature to it as well.

1831
02:15:39,244 --> 02:15:43,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to start with the content that was originally available.

1832
02:15:45,225 --> 02:15:48,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the free 20 song pack or whatever.

1833
02:15:50,066 --> 02:15:52,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that'll be interesting.

1834
02:15:52,967 --> 02:15:55,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool.

1835
02:15:55,548 --> 02:15:58,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, free 20 song pack, I guess, that was available already.

1836
02:15:59,009 --> 02:15:59,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the free...

1837
02:16:02,349 --> 02:16:19,385
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 download tracks from the original Rock Band download content library very cool so free songs for the people that bought Rock Band that's right because we people have to wait for a while well actually no I guess not because it just came out like last week or so so that wouldn't be too bad

1838
02:16:21,693 --> 02:16:22,894
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1839
02:16:48,499 --> 02:16:48,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

1840
02:16:49,399 --> 02:16:50,619
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very surprised.

1841
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:51,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too.

1842
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:53,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I am very surprised.

1843
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:55,601
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very curious to see how the download content is going to work.

1844
02:16:55,681 --> 02:16:56,921
[SPEAKER_13]: That is going to be very interesting.

1845
02:16:57,501 --> 02:16:58,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Very, very interesting.

1846
02:16:59,541 --> 02:16:59,901
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1847
02:17:00,702 --> 02:17:01,282
[SPEAKER_13]: More stories.

1848
02:17:01,462 --> 02:17:01,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes?

1849
02:17:03,082 --> 02:17:03,522
[SPEAKER_10]: There is.

1850
02:17:05,263 --> 02:17:06,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, this is pretty cool.

1851
02:17:07,743 --> 02:17:11,984
[SPEAKER_10]: For Rock Band, they're actually getting some new content.

1852
02:17:12,744 --> 02:17:16,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, they're getting Roy Orbison.

1853
02:17:17,844 --> 02:17:18,684
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that for cool?

1854
02:17:21,085 --> 02:17:22,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's Roy Orbison?

1855
02:17:22,206 --> 02:17:23,426
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems kind of random to me.

1856
02:17:24,647 --> 02:17:36,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is actually reported by CMT, but they're actually putting in a pack of Roy Orbison songs that are going to be on Rock Band 2.

1857
02:17:37,931 --> 02:17:38,492
[SPEAKER_03]: They would know.

1858
02:17:39,052 --> 02:17:40,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't he do You Got It?

1859
02:17:41,693 --> 02:17:42,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1860
02:17:42,913 --> 02:17:44,934
[SPEAKER_03]: They would know because CMT is owned by MTV.

1861
02:17:45,134 --> 02:17:46,175
[SPEAKER_13]: He sang Pretty Woman, right?

1862
02:17:46,195 --> 02:17:46,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he did.

1863
02:17:46,715 --> 02:17:46,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1864
02:17:47,639 --> 02:17:48,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty Woman.

1865
02:17:48,579 --> 02:17:49,740
[SPEAKER_13]: That's probably the song that's going to be there.

1866
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:50,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Just you wait.

1867
02:17:51,441 --> 02:17:52,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Roy Roberson's cool.

1868
02:17:52,561 --> 02:17:55,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus he was with the Traveling Wilburys, and that was pretty cool.

1869
02:17:56,644 --> 02:18:02,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Guitar Hero's going to be getting some more free download tracks in the form of two...

1870
02:18:04,795 --> 02:18:31,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Springsteen tracks apparently let's see the Born to Run and My Lucky Day I guess My Lucky Day is off his new single and Born to Run of course is a classic track and those will be available on both PSN and Xbox Live Marketplace January 27th through February 4th alright

1871
02:18:32,585 --> 02:18:33,566
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1872
02:18:58,150 --> 02:18:59,831
[SPEAKER_13]: There are cookies, actually, here in studio.

1873
02:19:00,032 --> 02:19:00,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1874
02:19:00,892 --> 02:19:10,399
[SPEAKER_13]: See, you left them here, and I was going to eat them all, but then I thought, what a good idea to keep cookies in studio on hand for those moments when Jamie says, I need a cookie.

1875
02:19:11,820 --> 02:19:14,843
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not going to actually happen after the beginning of the year, Rob.

1876
02:19:15,463 --> 02:19:15,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1877
02:19:15,623 --> 02:19:17,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going on a diet?

1878
02:19:17,985 --> 02:19:18,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't go on diets.

1879
02:19:19,106 --> 02:19:20,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going on a lifestyle adjustment?

1880
02:19:20,427 --> 02:19:22,668
[SPEAKER_10]: I adjust my lifestyle, and that's exactly what I'm doing.

1881
02:19:23,549 --> 02:19:23,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm re-adjusting.

1882
02:19:24,029 --> 02:19:26,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Will there be a type of cookie you can still eat?

1883
02:19:27,321 --> 02:19:28,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Fiber

1884
02:19:28,777 --> 02:19:29,697
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, fiber cookies.

1885
02:19:29,837 --> 02:19:31,978
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, fiber glass cookies.

1886
02:19:32,118 --> 02:19:35,979
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, if you hear a crackling noise, it's because I picked up a call like a minute ago and the poor guy's having to wait.

1887
02:19:36,019 --> 02:19:36,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1888
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:37,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1889
02:19:37,980 --> 02:19:39,581
[SPEAKER_01]: It's GSX-K and no acidic.

1890
02:19:39,641 --> 02:19:41,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not ordering a pizza for OLR.

1891
02:19:42,222 --> 02:19:44,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, please don't order pizzas to the studio if you know where we live.

1892
02:19:44,802 --> 02:19:45,363
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not nice.

1893
02:19:46,523 --> 02:19:47,883
[SPEAKER_13]: GSX-K, what's on your mind?

1894
02:19:48,304 --> 02:19:55,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I think I know what's on your mind because you live in a certain part of the Bay Area where you got something special this week, right?

1895
02:19:55,406 --> 02:19:58,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, DJ Max Signica at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

1896
02:19:58,496 --> 02:20:02,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell us about DJ Max Technica's Sunny Max, Sunny Max, Sunnyvale Golfland.

1897
02:20:02,418 --> 02:20:03,098
[SPEAKER_13]: What's it like?

1898
02:20:03,918 --> 02:20:08,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, basically, it's got, it's kind of like Elite Beat Agents meets Luminous.

1899
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:17,044
[SPEAKER_01]: You have two halves of the screen, you have this line going from one side of the screen to the other, and then there's these markers you have to press as the line goes over them.

1900
02:20:20,285 --> 02:20:25,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like beat meaning that as you press the markers, you recreate parts of the music.

1901
02:20:27,288 --> 02:20:27,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1902
02:20:29,827 --> 02:20:30,648
[SPEAKER_13]: But will it blend?

1903
02:20:30,828 --> 02:20:31,949
[SPEAKER_13]: No, is it fun?

1904
02:20:32,009 --> 02:20:32,689
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I want to know.

1905
02:20:32,749 --> 02:20:33,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it fun?

1906
02:20:33,330 --> 02:20:34,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you have fun with it?

1907
02:20:34,450 --> 02:20:36,732
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty fun.

1908
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:47,220
[SPEAKER_01]: On the first day, we had like 20 people in line, so between turns, I had to wait 20 games, which wasn't really a problem for me.

1909
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:48,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I just played other games between rounds.

1910
02:20:49,021 --> 02:20:52,123
[SPEAKER_13]: My god, isn't that like a three-hour wait, 20 games?

1911
02:20:52,263 --> 02:20:53,104
[SPEAKER_13]: No, at least an hour.

1912
02:20:53,644 --> 02:20:54,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends.

1913
02:20:55,425 --> 02:20:58,808
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is the life meter on the game is very harsh, like

1914
02:20:59,525 --> 02:21:28,153
[SPEAKER_01]: if you miss like seven to ten notes in a row you automatically fail and it's not like say poppin music where if you fail the first stage you can still go on to the next plus like on the final stage like the difficulty progression like from one stage to the next is really hard like on the first stage you can pick a level one song but on the second the lowest you can pick is level three i think and for the final stage the lowest you can pick is a level five so but third stage you have songs that

1915
02:21:28,903 --> 02:21:33,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, you have a lot of trouble with any end up failing within the first 30 seconds.

1916
02:21:33,744 --> 02:21:35,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

1917
02:21:54,415 --> 02:21:58,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that Konami sued Rockstar for Indie Groove in one, right?

1918
02:21:58,199 --> 02:21:58,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yeah.

1919
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:07,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, personally, I think the whole Indie Groove thing had it coming because it was basically DDR just with different music and charts and, like, some modifiers.

1920
02:22:09,088 --> 02:22:14,933
[SPEAKER_01]: DJMAX, I have different opinions for because at least it stands out to be different from Beatmania.

1921
02:22:14,974 --> 02:22:17,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, DJMAX Portable, that...

1922
02:22:18,334 --> 02:22:22,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Konami's hasn't really done a portable 2DX.

1923
02:22:22,497 --> 02:22:28,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, there's the Game Boy Beat Minis, but from what I hear, those aren't really good, and they weren't very popular.

1924
02:22:29,501 --> 02:22:45,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with... Portable's... DJ Maxx Portable, I mean, it was like... It was so successful that it initially became its own series, and... So, we just kind of have mixed feelings about this lawsuit, I mean...

1925
02:22:46,983 --> 02:22:47,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a lot.

1926
02:22:47,784 --> 02:22:49,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And DJ Ranma S is a lot.

1927
02:22:49,745 --> 02:22:56,430
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I don't know if... I don't know if PandaVision really deserves this.

1928
02:22:56,490 --> 02:23:02,794
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean... You know, I gotta say though, you get us thinking about something.

1929
02:23:02,834 --> 02:23:06,957
[SPEAKER_13]: I gotta say, you have a well thought out point because you got me thinking about something I didn't think about before.

1930
02:23:07,858 --> 02:23:10,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, like, I...

1931
02:23:11,909 --> 02:23:12,429
[SPEAKER_13]: In the Groove was DDR

1932
02:23:42,338 --> 02:23:44,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone in studio think that changes things at all?

1933
02:23:58,277 --> 02:24:02,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it could be used as, you know, you could play DDR on it.

1934
02:24:02,778 --> 02:24:06,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, kind of like that Stepmania thing for PSP, right?

1935
02:24:06,999 --> 02:24:07,659
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was saying.

1936
02:24:08,019 --> 02:24:11,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can play DDR on it, but a lot of people would be like, what's the point?

1937
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:13,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1938
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:13,681
[SPEAKER_13]: What is the point?

1939
02:24:13,741 --> 02:24:16,301
[SPEAKER_13]: I never understood the point of DDR on a portable platform.

1940
02:24:16,901 --> 02:24:19,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on the go, I mean, sometimes you can't.

1941
02:24:21,272 --> 02:24:48,748
[SPEAKER_03]: or you can't take your pad and such with you but here's the thing though before I remember talking to a Konami rep one time about when they were planning on bringing over Guitar Freaks and this was like a long time ago and they're like well unfortunately they don't know how to you know they don't know how to market a guitar game for the US you know whereas like a DJing game oh people want to play you know

1942
02:24:49,229 --> 02:24:49,909
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1943
02:25:17,475 --> 02:25:20,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it would be kind of cool, maybe like a Beatmania game or something like that.

1944
02:25:20,696 --> 02:25:21,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, wait.

1945
02:25:22,596 --> 02:25:27,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a pump and a dim on the PSP, but that also, but that tanked, as far as I'm concerned.

1946
02:25:29,217 --> 02:25:30,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what is the fucking point?

1947
02:25:31,138 --> 02:25:31,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really?

1948
02:25:32,498 --> 02:25:34,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Beat and Groovy on the PSP?

1949
02:25:34,459 --> 02:25:37,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe.

1950
02:25:37,059 --> 02:25:38,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, PSP and Groovy, oh gosh.

1951
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:45,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Beat and Groovy had a lot of potential, I mean, I can understand why it's only five buttons, but, I mean...

1952
02:25:46,977 --> 02:25:50,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever was behind Beat'n Groovy just handled it really poorly.

1953
02:25:50,178 --> 02:25:52,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the songs are too easy.

1954
02:25:52,759 --> 02:25:57,000
[SPEAKER_01]: They went out of their way to replace all the awesome poppin' music characters.

1955
02:26:00,522 --> 02:26:01,482
[SPEAKER_13]: God, you are so right.

1956
02:26:02,222 --> 02:26:06,404
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what's so frustrating about Beat'n Groovy is that Beat'n Groovy did have a lot of potential to be a really awesome game.

1957
02:26:07,144 --> 02:26:08,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, they already have that game.

1958
02:26:08,384 --> 02:26:11,285
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called Poppin' Music, and it's superior in every way.

1959
02:26:12,306 --> 02:26:13,766
[SPEAKER_13]: It's insulting.

1960
02:26:13,866 --> 02:26:16,387
[SPEAKER_13]: What Konami did with Beat'n Groovy is insulting.

1961
02:26:17,185 --> 02:26:19,466
[SPEAKER_13]: to us people that have been supporting them for so many years.

1962
02:26:19,566 --> 02:26:21,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, there's really no other way to describe it.

1963
02:26:22,727 --> 02:26:30,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I can understand the rationale behind the 5Bot mode, but, like, the lack of songlist and such, I mean, hell, look at the US version of Beatmania.

1964
02:26:30,369 --> 02:26:45,674
[SPEAKER_01]: That had, like, at least 30 songs ranging from really easy to really hard, and aside from that 5K Beatmania mode, and the new difficulty system and the racism, which, isn't that really big of a deal?

1965
02:26:45,714 --> 02:26:45,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean...

1966
02:26:47,282 --> 02:26:51,263
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it was pretty faithful as far as the basics go.

1967
02:26:51,323 --> 02:26:54,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas being Greer, like, what the fuck is this?

1968
02:26:55,525 --> 02:26:58,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, GSECA, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

1969
02:26:58,026 --> 02:27:01,027
[SPEAKER_13]: But thank you for the review of DJ Maxx Technica.

1970
02:27:01,227 --> 02:27:04,508
[SPEAKER_13]: And I definitely will be going to the Bay Area at some point to check it out, I promise.

1971
02:27:05,548 --> 02:27:06,909
[SPEAKER_13]: I might be there as soon as next weekend.

1972
02:27:07,269 --> 02:27:09,810
[SPEAKER_13]: I have stuff going on in South Bay next weekend anyway.

1973
02:27:09,870 --> 02:27:10,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I might swing by.

1974
02:27:10,590 --> 02:27:12,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me know on Twitter.

1975
02:27:12,551 --> 02:27:12,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I have

1976
02:27:14,738 --> 02:27:16,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Free Time Ball next week anyways.

1977
02:27:16,499 --> 02:27:21,981
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem is I have to take my female friend with me who thinks video games are stupid, so I don't know how I'm going to entertain her, but we'll think of something.

1978
02:27:22,361 --> 02:27:23,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, alright then.

1979
02:27:23,182 --> 02:27:23,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1980
02:27:24,202 --> 02:27:24,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, see ya.

1981
02:27:24,862 --> 02:27:25,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

1982
02:27:38,462 --> 02:27:41,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, my friend that goes with me doesn't get the video game thing.

1983
02:27:41,445 --> 02:27:42,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1984
02:27:43,466 --> 02:27:46,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I have returned to spam up the airwaves even more.

1985
02:27:46,809 --> 02:27:49,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Please do, Jason, what's on your mind?

1986
02:27:49,912 --> 02:27:51,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to talk about something earlier.

1987
02:27:51,574 --> 02:27:55,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even remember what it was, but something else just hit me, so I'll kill time with that.

1988
02:27:55,597 --> 02:27:55,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1989
02:27:55,878 --> 02:28:00,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just me, or was this a year of classical throwbacks?

1990
02:28:02,401 --> 02:28:05,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, look at what game topped our list.

1991
02:28:05,324 --> 02:28:10,129
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if we didn't put anything on the list, Mega Man 9 would have won amongst the listeners, hands down.

1992
02:28:11,430 --> 02:28:14,854
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty good definitive pick, and that is what I mean.

1993
02:28:15,014 --> 02:28:22,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I was basically just going to elaborate and say, sure, years back, Nintendo has resold their whole catalog, but that doesn't mean anything.

1994
02:28:22,481 --> 02:28:26,122
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the year of Mega Man 9, Braid, and I had another example.

1995
02:28:26,282 --> 02:28:28,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it gaming or is it Capcom?

1996
02:28:28,903 --> 02:28:41,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, you know, the biggest ones I think of, Mega Man 9, Bionic Commando Rearmed, which was pretty damn impressive, and Super Street Fighter Turbo HD Remix Super Uber.

1997
02:28:41,386 --> 02:28:42,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe I paid $10 for this version.

1998
02:28:43,606 --> 02:28:45,447
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie, The Game Man, in a mystery third style?

1999
02:28:45,507 --> 02:28:45,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2000
02:28:49,545 --> 02:29:01,076
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Capcom was one of the biggest offenders in this category, but at the same time, I think Capcom finally started doing the games this year, but we wanted them to do these downloadable games when they first came out.

2001
02:29:02,077 --> 02:29:02,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.

2002
02:29:02,937 --> 02:29:03,218
[SPEAKER_13]: In a way.

2003
02:29:04,144 --> 02:29:06,306
[SPEAKER_13]: But also, you know, a game like LittleBigPlanet.

2004
02:29:06,906 --> 02:29:09,969
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the first thing people do in LittleBigPlanet's level creator?

2005
02:29:10,509 --> 02:29:12,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Remake World 1-1 for Mario Brothers.

2006
02:29:12,631 --> 02:29:14,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, make Mario LittleBigPlanet.

2007
02:29:14,152 --> 02:29:15,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say porn.

2008
02:29:15,854 --> 02:29:17,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Or porn, but you know what I mean?

2009
02:29:17,415 --> 02:29:18,616
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll make the cock level.

2010
02:29:18,756 --> 02:29:25,842
[SPEAKER_13]: A large majority of those levels are, you know, remakes of other games from another day in this newer engine.

2011
02:29:26,362 --> 02:29:29,045
[SPEAKER_13]: So there definitely is a big retro vibe going on in 08.

2012
02:29:30,270 --> 02:29:37,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys have gone back and actually watched it, or actually looked for it, but you remember the Gradius level that the Japanese guy made?

2013
02:29:37,891 --> 02:29:38,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2014
02:29:38,852 --> 02:29:39,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was talking about.

2015
02:29:41,132 --> 02:29:42,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in case, I just referred to it by name.

2016
02:29:43,052 --> 02:29:45,513
[SPEAKER_04]: The level name was Libidus.jp.

2017
02:29:46,073 --> 02:29:48,873
[SPEAKER_04]: He has made SuperLibius.jp.

2018
02:29:49,674 --> 02:29:52,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up.

2019
02:29:53,154 --> 02:29:54,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, I'm going to have to check his levels.

2020
02:29:54,554 --> 02:29:57,895
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't looked at it in a while, but that guy does some amazing shit in LittleBigPlanet.

2021
02:29:58,536 --> 02:30:05,142
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting because he has, yeah, he did all of the Beatmania type level and, no, not a math level.

2022
02:30:05,563 --> 02:30:05,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

2023
02:30:08,305 --> 02:30:12,389
[SPEAKER_13]: There was another weird one, I think it was supposed to be based off some Japanese shooter, but I didn't understand it.

2024
02:30:12,649 --> 02:30:18,075
[SPEAKER_13]: But now, like, that they've given an actual paint gun, like, I'm curious to see what he does next.

2025
02:30:18,255 --> 02:30:18,755
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I mean?

2026
02:30:18,815 --> 02:30:21,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's a huge, that's a huge extra mechanic they've put in the game.

2027
02:30:25,523 --> 02:30:31,346
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that I don't like about this Super Libius is that at the same time it adds a very interesting twist.

2028
02:30:31,546 --> 02:30:39,811
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're getting shot at and you shoot that bullet, the two bullets bounce off and fly in the other direction.

2029
02:30:40,451 --> 02:30:41,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And fly in opposite directions.

2030
02:30:42,453 --> 02:30:44,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, it's a vertical scroller.

2031
02:30:44,354 --> 02:30:53,839
[SPEAKER_04]: He has this, if you think of really, really old vertical shoot-em-ups, he has a crosshair that's not even a quarter of the way up the screen, permanently fixed right in front of your ship.

2032
02:30:54,960 --> 02:30:59,723
[SPEAKER_04]: There are ground, quote-unquote, enemies shooting at you that you can't destroy.

2033
02:31:00,023 --> 02:31:00,784
[SPEAKER_13]: What was that game?

2034
02:31:00,824 --> 02:31:02,525
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a game on the NES that had that.

2035
02:31:02,565 --> 02:31:03,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it Xanax?

2036
02:31:03,485 --> 02:31:03,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Xevious?

2037
02:31:04,846 --> 02:31:06,487
[SPEAKER_13]: You had that crosshair permanently fixed.

2038
02:31:07,007 --> 02:31:08,408
[SPEAKER_13]: You might be thinking Zaxxon.

2039
02:31:09,048 --> 02:31:09,749
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not Zaxxon.

2040
02:31:09,769 --> 02:31:10,589
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was Xevious.

2041
02:31:10,970 --> 02:31:12,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Xevious, with the little blue landers.

2042
02:31:12,791 --> 02:31:13,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it Xevious?

2043
02:31:13,851 --> 02:31:14,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I think so.

2044
02:31:14,151 --> 02:31:15,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that target showed you where the bombs would drop.

2045
02:31:16,273 --> 02:31:16,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2046
02:31:16,633 --> 02:31:17,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's what it was.

2047
02:31:17,854 --> 02:31:20,435
[SPEAKER_13]: As you were describing it, I thought it was Xevious.

2048
02:31:21,956 --> 02:31:22,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

2049
02:31:23,186 --> 02:31:23,906
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2050
02:31:53,639 --> 02:31:54,559
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2051
02:32:11,994 --> 02:32:12,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Break it.

2052
02:32:12,654 --> 02:32:13,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2053
02:32:13,134 --> 02:32:14,935
[SPEAKER_04]: If I break the monitor, then I'm not going for the show.

2054
02:32:15,955 --> 02:32:20,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Being the fact that I've never been much of a WoW person, I can't offer an MMO person, rather.

2055
02:32:20,696 --> 02:32:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really offer much advice.

2056
02:32:22,317 --> 02:32:22,717
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all right.

2057
02:32:22,897 --> 02:32:23,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get to it someday.

2058
02:32:23,897 --> 02:32:25,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have a lot of fun when I play a little bit of Planet.

2059
02:32:25,758 --> 02:32:26,818
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get to a level at some point.

2060
02:32:27,418 --> 02:32:27,658
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2061
02:32:27,698 --> 02:32:33,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Jason, we're going to let you go to try and get a couple more calls, and we have to read the list list results and see if you're suggesting me the top three.

2062
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:35,661
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have better voted me in.

2063
02:32:35,721 --> 02:32:36,561
[SPEAKER_04]: At least number two.

2064
02:32:36,681 --> 02:32:38,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I can respect a certain one for number one.

2065
02:32:38,882 --> 02:32:40,122
[SPEAKER_13]: We're about to find out in two seconds.

2066
02:32:42,239 --> 02:32:43,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, see you, Jason.

2067
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:43,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye, folks.

2068
02:32:45,221 --> 02:32:46,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Our fearless webmaster, Jason.

2069
02:32:46,942 --> 02:32:48,102
[SPEAKER_13]: VXJasonXV.

2070
02:32:48,903 --> 02:32:49,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Jason for short.

2071
02:32:52,445 --> 02:32:55,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about the winners, shall we, of Listless.

2072
02:32:55,046 --> 02:32:57,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry, we'll get back to the phone and do a couple more calls.

2073
02:32:57,087 --> 02:33:00,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get to the top three based on your votes.

2074
02:33:03,171 --> 02:33:05,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, I have to add it up here so I don't read it wrong.

2075
02:33:06,860 --> 02:33:09,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, there was definitely a very definitive top three tonight.

2076
02:33:09,661 --> 02:33:10,681
[SPEAKER_13]: No ties, no nothing.

2077
02:33:11,121 --> 02:33:13,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Very easy top three spelled out here tonight.

2078
02:33:13,482 --> 02:33:15,782
[SPEAKER_13]: The number three top news story of 2008.

2079
02:33:17,743 --> 02:33:18,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I'm curious.

2080
02:33:20,063 --> 02:33:23,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Folks here in studio, provided you didn't look over my shoulder.

2081
02:33:23,544 --> 02:33:25,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Any predictions on what they thought was the number one story of 2008?

2082
02:33:27,265 --> 02:33:27,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Cookie.

2083
02:33:28,425 --> 02:33:28,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Cookie.

2084
02:33:28,845 --> 02:33:30,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that was on the list, DarkSakura.

2085
02:33:30,366 --> 02:33:30,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki?

2086
02:33:30,586 --> 02:33:30,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Cookie.

2087
02:33:32,361 --> 02:33:37,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say either our 300th episode just because they're kissing ass or Guitar Hero.

2088
02:33:38,011 --> 02:33:38,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2089
02:33:38,952 --> 02:33:39,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradley?

2090
02:33:40,194 --> 02:33:40,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Any thoughts?

2091
02:33:41,176 --> 02:33:43,019
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

2092
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:43,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's see.

2093
02:33:44,341 --> 02:33:44,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

2094
02:33:45,383 --> 02:33:46,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, um...

2095
02:33:47,321 --> 02:33:49,122
[SPEAKER_13]: The number three biggest story of 2008.

2096
02:33:49,922 --> 02:33:50,922
[SPEAKER_13]: This is definitive.

2097
02:33:50,962 --> 02:33:51,842
[SPEAKER_13]: This is absolute.

2098
02:33:51,862 --> 02:33:52,683
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no arguing.

2099
02:33:52,983 --> 02:33:54,623
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a flawless process.

2100
02:33:55,483 --> 02:33:59,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Jack Thompson getting the beat down was the number three pick for the biggest story of 2008.

2101
02:33:59,585 --> 02:34:01,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2102
02:34:01,665 --> 02:34:02,565
[SPEAKER_13]: I said his name out loud.

2103
02:34:02,585 --> 02:34:03,466
[SPEAKER_13]: That just gives him power.

2104
02:34:03,506 --> 02:34:03,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

2105
02:34:04,922 --> 02:34:05,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, but not in the state of Florida.

2106
02:34:05,863 --> 02:34:11,486
[SPEAKER_13]: The number two biggest story of 2008 in gaming.

2107
02:34:12,326 --> 02:34:16,289
[SPEAKER_13]: The new Xbox experience brings us community games and Netflix.

2108
02:34:16,889 --> 02:34:17,429
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

2109
02:34:18,450 --> 02:34:23,593
[SPEAKER_13]: And lastly, the top story of 2008, the biggest story in gaming.

2110
02:34:25,274 --> 02:34:29,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio hits 300 episodes in six years.

2111
02:34:29,596 --> 02:34:30,957
[SPEAKER_13]: You narcissistic bastards.

2112
02:34:33,652 --> 02:34:36,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it is monumental, like I said.

2113
02:34:37,054 --> 02:34:40,236
[SPEAKER_10]: We are that full of ourselves.

2114
02:34:43,378 --> 02:34:58,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I just love that the chat, you know, it just goes to show our live listeners and the podcast listeners too, the whole family here at OLR, everybody that helps make this show a success, everybody has to spank their monkey sometimes.

2115
02:34:58,346 --> 02:35:01,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody contributes to that in one way or another.

2116
02:35:02,412 --> 02:35:09,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Jason's going ape shit in the chat room and not letting people talk because they didn't vote his as the top three.

2117
02:35:09,477 --> 02:35:11,698
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say though, Jason, yours did get some votes.

2118
02:35:12,619 --> 02:35:14,720
[SPEAKER_13]: It would have come in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7th.

2119
02:35:14,820 --> 02:35:15,180
[SPEAKER_13]: No, 6th.

2120
02:35:15,661 --> 02:35:20,644
[SPEAKER_13]: It would have come in 6th out of the list.

2121
02:35:21,224 --> 02:35:21,685
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

2122
02:35:24,646 --> 02:35:25,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Jason.

2123
02:35:25,727 --> 02:35:26,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Very rude.

2124
02:35:27,008 --> 02:35:29,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, it's rude to silence those who disagree with you.

2125
02:35:31,243 --> 02:35:33,344
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, let's do another call.

2126
02:35:36,464 --> 02:35:41,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Launch Radio's username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.

2127
02:35:41,365 --> 02:35:43,426
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do like one more call, then we will wrap up.

2128
02:35:44,046 --> 02:35:46,307
[SPEAKER_13]: For live listeners, no afterbirth tonight.

2129
02:35:46,367 --> 02:35:50,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, guys, we got a late start, so we have jobs to get to tomorrow.

2130
02:35:50,387 --> 02:35:52,368
[SPEAKER_13]: We're already well after midnight on the East Coast.

2131
02:35:53,985 --> 02:36:01,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we're not going to do an afterbirth tonight, but do stay tuned because I do have a special message for you after the show, just for the live folks.

2132
02:36:02,211 --> 02:36:03,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get to one more call.

2133
02:36:03,052 --> 02:36:03,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2134
02:36:03,893 --> 02:36:04,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

2135
02:36:05,474 --> 02:36:06,735
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Legend of Zaku.

2136
02:36:07,555 --> 02:36:08,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Legend of Zaku.

2137
02:36:08,376 --> 02:36:08,856
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

2138
02:36:10,598 --> 02:36:17,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing but just gloating, just looking back at what was once this year and the next few days will be the next year.

2139
02:36:18,984 --> 02:36:21,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this year has gone by really fast.

2140
02:36:24,657 --> 02:36:28,560
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think of the list of the biggest stories of 2008?

2141
02:36:30,662 --> 02:36:33,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it was pretty much concise of what happened.

2142
02:36:33,385 --> 02:36:38,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Jack Thompson's disbarring should have been up there pretty high.

2143
02:36:38,991 --> 02:36:39,551
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2144
02:36:59,212 --> 02:37:00,193
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2145
02:37:17,622 --> 02:37:18,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep talking about him.

2146
02:37:19,564 --> 02:37:24,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides that, obviously, you know, Final Fantasy, you know, 12 and 13 on the 360.

2147
02:37:24,689 --> 02:37:26,171
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the biggest.

2148
02:37:27,573 --> 02:37:31,657
[SPEAKER_07]: That right there would have been the, you know, the big summer surprise right there.

2149
02:37:32,285 --> 02:37:35,827
[SPEAKER_07]: It was almost like jaw-dropping that it came out of nowhere.

2150
02:37:54,995 --> 02:38:01,379
[SPEAKER_13]: I think at some point during this year, Capcom came out and said, look, the only way we're going to make our money back is to put our games out on all the platforms.

2151
02:38:02,140 --> 02:38:07,583
[SPEAKER_13]: And ever since then, in my opinion, this news has not been as shocking.

2152
02:38:07,623 --> 02:38:08,103
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's just me.

2153
02:38:08,123 --> 02:38:08,824
[SPEAKER_07]: But think about it.

2154
02:38:08,884 --> 02:38:16,989
[SPEAKER_07]: When Square dropped that bombshell over E3, that was a critical blow to the PS3's exclusivity.

2155
02:38:17,469 --> 02:38:21,272
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing they have now is Metal Gear Solid 4 and first-party exclusives.

2156
02:38:22,108 --> 02:38:35,631
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, so it pretty much gives, you know, people less, you know, less of a reason to get a PS3 in the first place since there's no, you know, big ticket games, you know, exclusive for their system, you know, aside from the ones made by Sony themselves.

2157
02:38:36,618 --> 02:38:42,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, why should I get Final Fantasy XIII when I could get it for my 360 easily?

2158
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:46,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And rack up on the achievements and whatever other features they may have.

2159
02:38:47,102 --> 02:38:48,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the controller sucks?

2160
02:38:48,622 --> 02:38:48,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

2161
02:38:49,923 --> 02:38:53,024
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, you see the argument I'm trying to make, right?

2162
02:38:53,544 --> 02:38:54,264
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I do, I do.

2163
02:38:54,524 --> 02:38:55,064
[SPEAKER_13]: It was huge.

2164
02:38:55,284 --> 02:38:55,725
[SPEAKER_13]: It was huge.

2165
02:38:56,265 --> 02:38:57,705
[SPEAKER_13]: And Hits done agrees with you in chat.

2166
02:38:57,745 --> 02:39:01,106
[SPEAKER_13]: The FFXIII announcement was the top story of the year, no doubt.

2167
02:39:01,827 --> 02:39:05,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Square could pull it off, you know, in terms of making, you know...

2168
02:39:06,448 --> 02:39:22,819
[SPEAKER_07]: that version, Final Fantasy 360 version on the same level as the PS3 then they'll be raking in shit loads of money because of the tens of millions of users that make up the 360's install base.

2169
02:39:23,459 --> 02:39:31,845
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like in that way they see a bigger picture in terms of how much money they're willing to make.

2170
02:39:32,545 --> 02:39:35,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything else, every loyalty be damned.

2171
02:39:37,970 --> 02:39:42,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well, um, Zaku, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and try to wrap up the show?

2172
02:39:43,212 --> 02:39:48,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Steam and their sale this week, please, please get your, get Bioshock for five bucks.

2173
02:39:49,375 --> 02:39:51,836
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't be disappointed.

2174
02:39:52,476 --> 02:39:55,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Might as well go to Steam right now and just, like, get your cheap-ass games.

2175
02:39:56,658 --> 02:39:58,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2176
02:39:58,339 --> 02:39:58,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go.

2177
02:39:59,499 --> 02:40:02,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, a quick plug for Bioshock here before we close out the Skyplane.

2178
02:40:03,101 --> 02:40:03,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Zaku, have a good one.

2179
02:40:04,642 --> 02:40:07,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good new, have a good one, have a good, you know, new year.

2180
02:40:07,694 --> 02:40:08,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy New Year!

2181
02:40:10,335 --> 02:40:10,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2182
02:40:12,616 --> 02:40:14,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we are going to try to wrap it up here.

2183
02:40:16,637 --> 02:40:18,338
[SPEAKER_13]: And close up shop for the night.

2184
02:40:19,038 --> 02:40:21,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2185
02:40:21,879 --> 02:40:31,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, hey, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about Orange Lounge Radio because word of mouth is really the biggest way for us to spread word about the show.

2186
02:40:32,143 --> 02:40:34,384
[SPEAKER_13]: So we would really, really appreciate that.

2187
02:40:35,084 --> 02:40:35,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2188
02:40:37,208 --> 02:40:39,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2189
02:40:39,689 --> 02:40:42,811
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, your final thought for this last OLR of 2008.

2190
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:44,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Reject false icons.

2191
02:40:45,873 --> 02:40:46,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Well said.

2192
02:40:46,553 --> 02:40:54,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, PayPal's awesome to dump these stupid little gift cards that I have left with like $5 on each one of them and I can't really spend them in one place.

2193
02:40:55,098 --> 02:40:56,679
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, donate the money to myself.

2194
02:40:57,859 --> 02:40:58,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

2195
02:40:58,199 --> 02:40:59,620
[SPEAKER_13]: How'd you donate money to yourself?

2196
02:40:59,960 --> 02:41:02,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I created a donate link for myself and paid with credit card.

2197
02:41:04,863 --> 02:41:05,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

2198
02:41:05,123 --> 02:41:06,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh...

2199
02:41:07,577 --> 02:41:10,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Arcadian 42, Bradley, whatever your name is.

2200
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:12,401
[SPEAKER_13]: No, thank you for being here.

2201
02:41:13,181 --> 02:41:15,903
[SPEAKER_13]: And what is your final thought?

2202
02:41:16,564 --> 02:41:19,226
[SPEAKER_12]: My New Year's resolution to play the games I bought this year.

2203
02:41:19,846 --> 02:41:20,326
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2204
02:41:20,727 --> 02:41:23,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too.

2205
02:41:24,109 --> 02:41:32,075
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought for this, the last show of 2008, kids, your pancreas is a much more important organ than you might have thought before.

2206
02:41:33,436 --> 02:41:34,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Just so you know.

2207
02:41:35,798 --> 02:41:37,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that's going to do it.

2208
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:40,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys once again for supporting us throughout 2008.

2209
02:41:41,023 --> 02:41:42,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Will you come back and do it again in 2009?

2210
02:41:45,508 --> 02:41:45,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

2211
02:41:46,369 --> 02:41:46,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, what the hell.

2212
02:41:47,229 --> 02:41:48,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, see you next year.

2213
02:41:49,102 --> 02:41:51,784
