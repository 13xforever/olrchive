148235	148955	Rectify.
149736	150056	All right.
151127	151707	I'm just kidding.
151747	153288	It's actually not that bad so far.
153308	155548	Just needs a little tinkering.
155588	156808	Needs some older games in there.
156848	158189	Needs a good potty.
158329	159669	But I haven't sent my list yet.
159709	163310	They need to take Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid off because those games suck.
163370	164530	Those games both suck.
164610	165891	Both games suck really bad.
166091	167371	Like your mom.
167731	168591	Alright.
169352	169692	Anyhow.
170152	171932	They need to put more Wii music on there.
172572	173833	Yes, I'm getting to the Forge game music.
173853	174553	I gotta load it.
175851	182676	Thank you guys for staying with us up on this very late hour here on Orange Laundry throughout all our technical difficulties and all that stuff.
182856	183336	Shut up.
184337	185298	What?
186378	187759	Do you want to introduce the cookie tonight?
187959	188420	Cookie!
192342	201449	My favorite Christmas memory when I was growing up was the... Oh, God bless you little pixies.
203442	205764	was the Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas song.
207305	209706	By the way, we can't pay for the rights for this.
209726	210987	This will not make it on the album.
211267	215290	So you'll be able to go, oh, I heard bits that aren't even on the fucking CD, man.
215990	217211	That's how fucking cool I am.
217231	218312	They didn't cut that thing out.
219943	225650	When I was growing up, my favorite Christmas memory was the album and the Chipmunks album, because we had it on LP.
226151	230195	And you know what I'm talking about?
230215	230876	Remember that song?
231297	236383	The little Chipmunks are singing it, and then there's that guy Dave going, all right now, Chipmunks, let's all...
238447	245950	My brother and I had that on an LP, so what we would do is we would play that on the slowest speed possible on the record player.
246510	253153	So then it sounded like four normal monotone guys just singing this boring Christmas song.
253513	261677	And then this demon from like the ninth level of traitors and murderers just screaming at them.
263502	273366	and then it just it was so different it was like Christmas Christmas time is here time for toys and time for cheer
293604	296425	Theodora, Alvin,
326355	326995	Okay.
334560	335501	That actually was kind of funny.
336581	336922	I lulled.
337742	337982	All right.
339323	339703	Bye, guys.
