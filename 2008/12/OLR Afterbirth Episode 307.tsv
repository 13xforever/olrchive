140000	146000	Send in your list and you can rectify this terrible list if you need to
146000	148000	Rectify
148000	157000	Rectify, alright, I'm just kidding, it's actually not that bad so far, just these little tinkering, these little tinkering needs some older games in there
157000	158000	Needs a good potty
158000	160000	But I haven't sent my list yet, so
160000	163000	They need to take Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid off because those games suck
163000	166000	Those games both suck, both games really bad

184000	186000	Hey Rob, br br br br br br br br
186000	188000	Do you wanna introduce the cookie tonight?
188000	192000	Cookie!
192000	198000	My favorite Christmas memory, when I was growing up, was the uhh
198000	203000	Oh god bless you little pixies
203000	207000	Was the Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas song
207000	211000	By the way, this, we can't pay for the rights for this, this will not make it on the album
211000	216000	So you'll be able to go, oh, I heard bits that aren't even on the fucking CD, man
216000	220000	It's a fucking cool line, they had to cut that thing out
220000	224000	When I was growing up, my favorite Christmas memory was the Alvin and the Chipmunks album
224000	226000	Because we had it on LP
226000	228000	And you know what I'm talking about, the uhh
228000	234000	Remember that song? Little Chipmunks are singing and there's that guy Dave going
234000	238000	Alright now Chipmunks, let's all br br br
238000	242000	My brother and I had that on an LP, so what we would do is
242000	246000	We would play that as slow, on the slowest beat possible on the record player
246000	251000	So then, it sounded like four normal monotone guys
251000	253000	Just singing this boring Christmas song
253000	261000	And then this demon from like the ninth level of traitors and murderers just screaming at them
263000	265000	And then it just, it was just so different, it was like
265000	269000	Christmas, Christmas, time is here
269000	273000	Time for toys, and time for cheer
273000	293960	okay
