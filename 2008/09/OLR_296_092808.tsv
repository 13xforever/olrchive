13817	22732	Tonight, September 28, 2008, a Banjo-Kazooie remake gets dated, Dance Hero gets trademarked, and an old friend of ours gets the boot.
31758	33559	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
33599	36081	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36101	39142	We are that podcast on the internet where every gamer has a voice.
39162	43525	Because every week we talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43545	46147	And we invite you to come be a part of our program.
46347	48888	You can join us in chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
48908	50109	You can talk to us by phone later.
50169	50889	Send us an email.
51330	52110	However you want to do it.
52150	53731	You guys are going to help steer the show tonight.
54391	55032	But we'll be here.
55612	58780	Leading you through the next few hours where we talk about the latest and greatest video gaming.
58800	59642	My name is Rob Roberts.
59662	62830	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
63111	63492	Hi.
63732	64233	How are you doing?
65293	65713	I'm okay.
66013	67514	Your voice sounds a little better this week.
67834	68114	It is.
68454	68734	All right.
69215	69595	Good to hear.
70395	72436	Also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
72596	72776	Hi.
73336	73836	How you doing?
74077	74237	Good.
74677	76257	You have a stack of cheese.
76277	80619	I don't know if the Justin TV users can see this or they can't because it's hidden behind your laptop here.
80899	83020	He has a stack of cheeseburgers.
83100	83760	It's only two.
84581	88042	Because, I mean, McDonald's cheeseburgers are like micro cheeseburgers.
88062	92284	But I'm laughing because he literally has a stack of cheeseburgers.
93324	100707	As we'll get into it a little bit later in the program, I can't put them on the floor because there's acts of nature attack.
100727	104388	There's like here in the studio, which we have a real high-tech studio.
104448	106128	It's basically a converted garage.
106569	109590	We have ants or something that live under the floor.
109890	119113	So the funny thing is if you put food on the ground, the ants will rise up from underneath and just storm the food is what Loki found out last week.
119133	119533	Exactly.
119934	120437	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
124181	125021	I thought it was a fluke.
125061	126562	I was like, ants in the garage?
126582	127982	There's no ants in the garage.
128222	129583	Ants in my garage?
129983	130263	All right.
130923	133524	Anyhow, let's also say hello to a special guest we have tonight.
133584	137125	And it's not very often that we have a fourth person joining us in the studio anymore.
137406	138366	What happened to the locals?
138806	139886	Locals don't love us anymore.
140006	140747	They found women.
142207	142907	I guess so.
143268	145328	Well, so we had to bring a woman on our show.
145408	147389	And we had to bring a non-local woman on our show.
147729	148289	But we love her.
148389	150790	Her name is Tiara, all the way from Las Vegas.
150830	151230	Say hello.
151931	152211	Hi.
152511	152871	How are you?
153479	154059	Not too bad.
154079	154739	All right.
154779	155480	How was the flight?
155760	155960	Good?
156280	157260	The flight was really good.
157480	158481	They messed up my ticket.
159001	165583	The terminals were down for the automatic ticket printing instead of having to go to the flight attendant type people.
165843	166023	Right.
166243	167904	And so I got upgraded to first class for $20.
168024	168424	Nice.
169224	169384	Yeah.
169804	171325	Did you see anyone famous in first class?
171745	173005	No, just a bunch of old people.
175290	176131	Famous old people.
176751	177091	Awesome.
177752	179653	All right, well, welcome to the show tonight.
179693	186317	And, of course, the other reason why Tiara was here, she didn't come to join us just for Orange Lounge Radio, although, you know, that would be nice.
186677	187798	No, I came for Journey.
187918	192501	Yes, part of the reason Tiara came so we could go see Journey and Heart and Cheap Trick.
192521	195483	And if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks, you know, we don't talk about games.
195503	196443	We talk about our personal lives.
197544	198185	We love Journey.
199085	200507	And if you're Jamie, we love Heart.
200727	203149	And for me, you love both, honestly.
203329	203750	You really do.
203770	204170	And Cheap Trick.
204190	204791	Heart is great.
204971	207854	Cheap Trick, they're okay, although they're a bunch of divas because I met them years ago.
208174	210256	But anyway, Heart and Journey are great.
210296	212619	Now, here's the sad news is that we went to the concert, right?
212679	215542	As a lot of folks have been listening to us weeks and weeks, we talk about this.
215582	216563	We finally went to the concert.
216963	221407	What should have been a 40-minute drive up to Marysville took us two and a half hours.
222028	222829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
251303	251783	DarkSakura
275456	277917	We played some rock band over the weekend.
278798	285382	And Dan downloaded Mega Man 9, which was really, really, really cool.
285583	292668	I mean, I was totally just in old school heaven watching a lot of the stuff.
294469	297691	And of course I played a little Ragnarok as usual.
298592	304476	And that's really, really about it for my gaming week.
305473	305793	Awesome.
306714	309015	You know, one thing I love about Mega Man 9... I was busy dealing with other things.
309395	309715	Oh, sure.
311376	317818	I wasn't able to get Mega Man 9 this week because I have my little thing going on with the Wii where I'm not downloading anything else on the Wii.
318278	321620	And I don't have a PlayStation 3 yet, although I'm thinking next week's the week.
322920	324401	And then Xbox 360.
324521	324821	I don't know.
324921	330023	I just can't imagine playing a classic video game on that Xbox 360 controller because that D-pad kind of sucks.
330364	332624	So I think I'm going to have to get it on PlayStation 3 if nothing else.
332985	333085	So...
334005	336186	hopefully soon, but I love listening to the soundtrack.
337346	340147	It's perfect for an old school Mega Man game.
340367	342547	You can even use flicker to your advantage.
343227	343507	Nice.
344167	349889	Like if you get hit and you're going through a tough spot, you just get hit once so that you flicker enough to get through the hard stuff.
350329	350609	Nice.
351249	352830	So maybe there's a reason not to turn it off.
355330	358011	It's old school Mega Man, that's all I can say.
358471	358751	Alright.
359131	360131	Loki, how was your gaming week?
361172	362432	My gaming week was alright.
362452	362492	Um,
363739	374222	I played a bit of Mercenaries, Mercenaries 2, and actually this week I finally got to try the co-op online and it's pretty fun actually.
374662	382364	I was playing with my friend Sean who just picked up the game and I swear to God this game gets even more glitchier the longer I play it.
383625	384885	It's awesome though, I like that.
384985	386506	Did Loki just say more glitchier?
386966	387486	I think he did.
388026	389006	Yes, more glitchier.
389406	391187	Seriously, more glitchier.
392256	395939	I could say it gets even glitchier, but no, it's more glitchier.
396179	397180	That's a technical term.
397260	398922	You're the most smartest host I've ever met.
398942	399842	I am the most smartest.
401304	401964	Smarterest.
402024	403886	Can we get that in an iTunes review, please?
404106	405307	Most smarterest.
405687	408470	The show is great, but it could be more glitchier.
409030	409931	More glitchier, yeah.
411451	412071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
434403	435584	It was a brand new helicopter, too.
435624	439825	The guy had just dropped it off for me, got in the helicopter, propeller would not spin.
439965	441026	I was like, well, this is useless.
441046	442607	Maybe you were just too fat for the copter.
443067	443407	No.
445188	449550	Hey, remember, this is my in-game persona, not real life.
449810	450470	Okay, my bad.
451911	453391	Then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto 4.
453431	455592	Did you just have maybe too much baggage in the back?
455612	456893	Because I think that's what happened to Aaliyah.
459226	463987	Well, I was carrying around this guy from United Petroleum, the fake oil company in the game.
464007	465367	Oh, okay.
466967	469788	But yeah, the game is just horribly glitched out, which is awesome.
471088	473229	Anyways, on to other things.
473649	478470	I played a game, a Flash game actually, called, I want to say it was Me and My Dad.
479510	484671	It's by the same people that do Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers.
484691	485771	And it's basically you're this...
487177	493420	I don't know, it's like some sort of demon kid who goes around beating up other kids.
494160	500583	Just like most of the people in the game are completely harmless, and just running around, you just brutally beat them to death.
501583	501963	It's awesome.
501983	503924	This sounds like a Loki dream game.
504684	505144	It's awesome.
505625	510146	So I played that a little bit, and let's see.
510747	511167	Also...
513396	514036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
534366	534766	I don't know.
552526	565732	I never saw the guy's dad at any point in this... Well, actually, the title screen did have a larger version of the main character, who I guess was his dad, but I don't understand what Mia... Maybe it's like a twist ending.
566012	570034	Maybe, I don't know, but maybe your dad joins you later and you can beat more people up.
570114	573296	I don't know, but it's... Yeah, that's what it was called, at least.
573556	578818	They had a link on Destructoid for it, so if you want to check it out, just kind of browse back a few pages.
579479	579919	But, um...
581052	583033	T-ara, do you have anything you want to share with your gaming week?
583053	585155	What types of games have you been playing?
610796	616880	Well, I haven't really had a chance to play a lot of games recently since I just started with school again.
617581	627108	But I did play Ragnarok with Jamie, and we played rock band, and we made Dan download Jimmy Buffett so that I could sing Margaritaville.
628148	628409	Nice.
628669	629429	So you were the singer?
630210	630650	Sometimes.
630830	631931	Let me guess, Jamie's bass player?
632832	636134	Actually, I did play a bit of bass, but I also made Dan get Skullcrusher Mountain.
636775	637115	Very cool.
640146	642048	Alright, that's pretty much it then?
642188	644149	Rock Band and learning?
644390	645350	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
645511	649954	And then Final Fantasy Tactics and Joan of Arc on the PSP.
650835	652196	I don't know much about Joan of Arc.
652316	652817	What's this game?
653708	672322	It's basically a tactics game, like Final Fantasy Tactics, except for it stars Joan of Arc, and it takes the whole history of what happened during the time when she was around, and turns it into this thing where magical demons are attacking, and you have to defeat them to save France.
675684	676384	Interesting.
676765	678146	Based on a true story.
678166	678286	Yeah.
679619	682263	They took some creative liberties, I think, but okay.
682424	683205	Yeah, just a few.
684688	685249	Very cool.
685429	686050	But is it fun?
686170	687092	That's the question.
687523	689824	Well, if you like tactics games, then yes, it's fun.
690364	697166	And I think it's kind of smart, even though they replaced all the people that were invading France and everything with quote-unquote demons.
697626	701867	It's still like if a kid played it, they might learn some history out of it.
702107	707728	Because a lot of it is based on actual fact, but then you've got the weird stuff.
707748	709069	Except for the demons and the magic.
711970	712510	Very nice.
712650	713130	All right, cool.
714121	714541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
735007	737008	Then World of Warcraft, of course.
737308	742590	And I guess the only new thing I really checked out this week was Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Marketplace.
742830	744410	How could I forget playing that?
745191	746191	What did you think, Loki?
746471	747231	Oh, it's awesome.
747531	749252	It's exactly how I remembered it.
750132	752833	It is, except I was kind of surprised that, well, I'm not.
752913	757475	I mean, it's basically like the Doom port where they didn't really redo anything.
757495	758295	You know what I mean?
759196	765178	But it does bring back a lot of great memories because, man, I played a lot of Duke Nukem 3D when I was in college.
765218	768359	I kind of wish they had it, but I understand why they didn't have it.
768419	771741	I wish they had the build editor in there to make your own levels.
771761	772621	That'd be awesome.
773181	781104	It's too bad that you can't do some type of... Or the other thing I'm disappointed in is there's no Atomic Edition in there as well, either.
782425	789668	They had a few added weapons and the brand new levels, including the one that parodied Disneyland.
790528	791628	I'm disappointed that wasn't in there.
792329	793649	Maybe it's a download pack later.
793669	794189	Who knows?
794289	794890	Download content.
794910	795170	Who knows?
795550	797010	But it's a very faithful port.
797070	800192	And if you've never played Duke Nukem 3D, at least check out the demo.
800532	800792	I think
801212	801993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
822130	822892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
833467	842315	I've had to pull out of E4ALL, which kind of stinks, but I am not going to be attending E4ALL this weekend after all, and I really apologize to those listeners that were planning on going.
843736	848240	Please still continue to go to the All Games booth, which is being co-run by the Championship Gaming Series.
848941	849921	It's going to be pretty cool.
849961	859350	They're going to have some old school gaming celebrities there, and I think that's kind of like one of the themes they're going with is old school, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun, and I'm really sad I can't go, but
860150	861391	Don't worry, it's gallbladder.
861411	861892	It's a very common...
887592	887872	I'll be fine.
887892	888172	So, that's that.
907040	909764	and at about, most of them have been three hours apiece.
909844	911226	I mean, some were two, some were three.
911266	913629	So let's say you said like two and a half hours for each one.
913649	916172	That's still like what?
916192	919776	750 hours at least of content we've done over the years.
919796	921699	That's like a million bajillion hours.
922139	922380	Yes.
922700	923321	Of content.
923361	923781	Tons.
924582	924843	All right.
926294	928375	All right, anyway, let's move on.
928435	928895	Gaming news.
929255	930296	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
930536	936779	Well, there's a Nintendo 64 game that's quite a classic that I never played, but looks interesting nonetheless.
937359	938259	Banjo-Kazooie.
938860	942321	We knew this was coming, the sort of remake or update to it.
943642	953246	And it is coming now exclusively to the Xbox Live Arcade on November 26th, and it will be running you 1,200 Microsoft points.
955663	956263	Banjo-Tooie early 2009
976590	977411	So that's pretty cool.
977531	983236	One other unique thing about this as well, there will be a stop and swap mode.
983636	992464	And what that's exactly going to do is progress that's made in the Xbox Live Arcade game will unlock things in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.
993345	994265	So that's kind of cool.
995246	999890	That's an interesting little crossover, but just kind of a ploy to get people to spend their money twice, right?
1000411	1000571	Yeah.
1000868	1001568	Castle Crashers, right?
1001609	1002449	New character if you have them both?
1002469	1002569	Yeah.
1031874	1032595	It's too childish for me now.
1059417	1060017	DarkSakura,
1077036	1080399	Real estate is too packed right now.
1080439	1083962	I have too many games I have to play in a short amount of time.
1084382	1088485	Saints Row 2 is going to be coming out and I won't give a shit about this game when Saints Row 2 comes out.
1088865	1091988	Kiki Nico in chat says, Rob, it's one of the best on Nintendo 64.
1092888	1093349	I understand.
1093389	1093969	I realize that.
1094009	1095330	It's just I never got around to it.
1095811	1097672	Do either of you ladies have an opinion on Banjo-Kazooie?
1098212	1098813	I never liked it.
1099665	1100386	Why, same theme?
1100466	1101207	Too childish, or?
1101467	1107233	Well, no, I mean, this is also coming from the person who just, what, a couple years ago was ranting and raving about Magic Pen Gel?
1108534	1109955	Dude, Magic Pen Gel is fucking awesome.
1110997	1111797	I still say they need another one.
1111817	1113159	With the penis monster that squirts?
1114338	1115820	Wow, we're so mature.
1116260	1118983	But I just never cared for how the game plays.
1119243	1119864	That's just me.
1119924	1129535	I never liked the sort of... It was like it would be more fun if it was actually side, but it was that behind view that just didn't seem very fun to me.
1130526	1131366	Wow, interesting.
1131887	1134288	I mean, I don't really have a hate or like opinion on it.
1134328	1135688	I just flat out never really played it.
1136149	1138890	Interesting, though, that overall in studio here were negative.
1138930	1140871	But to balance this out, there's positive in chat.
1141151	1143172	Frisbee says Banjo-Kazooie equals heart.
1143752	1147354	Kikaniko says they're not liking this BK Bashcast.
1149000	1152782	I'm not bashing the game, it's just like, I don't want to play it.
1153382	1155123	It just doesn't look like something I would enjoy.
1155163	1161145	Here's a question I'll ask you though, is that, you know, one place that Microsoft's really been struggling is appealing to the family demographic.
1161165	1163486	They've always kind of been the hardcore gaming system.
1163746	1168428	This is a lot better than Rocky and Bullwinkle, or the fucking crappy Spongebob game that they had on there.
1169428	1171729	Or, wasn't there like a Shrek game on there too?
1172290	1173510	Either way, those all sucked.
1173650	1176992	I'd rather have, like, you know, you're going to have kids playing an Xbox Live or a K-Game?
1177012	1177172	Perfect.
1177552	1177912	Perfect.
1178497	1179118	Perfect for them.
1180019	1180299	Alright.
1180579	1182861	Don't let them play that crappy, like, Spongebob crap.
1182921	1185143	That Rocky and Bullwinkle game was very disappointing.
1185663	1189127	You know, if you love Rocky and Bullwinkle, too, it just pains you to look at that game.
1189487	1194852	It's just that it may have been good in, like, the 80s or earlier.
1195192	1202058	I mean, it's just now, it's like they tried to bring back, what was that, the, um, what was the race game?
1202358	1203139	Wacky Racist.
1204005	1205506	Wacky Races is great.
1205566	1207987	Yeah, Wacky Races is great for the people that remember it.
1208087	1210849	Kids do not know what the fuck Wacky Races is.
1211769	1213490	I don't even think I know what Wacky Races is.
1213971	1215472	I barely know what Wacky Races is.
1215492	1218913	Wacky Races was also in the same tone as the Laugh Olympics.
1219074	1219674	Remember that?
1220715	1220935	No.
1220975	1226898	All the Hanna-Barbera characters in big competitions, only Wacky Races was... Oh, okay.
1226998	1228059	Yes, I remember now.
1228419	1228599	Okay.
1228639	1230660	I personally preferred the Laugh Olympics.
1230920	1233742	It's kind of like the Justice League of these types of cartoons, right?
1233942	1238366	But it was all Hanna-Barbera, so you had the great grape ape and hair bears.
1238506	1242269	And Huckleberry Hound and all those people were doing battle with the Flintstones.
1242289	1242929	I love Hanna-Barbera.
1243009	1243610	Now I remember.
1243850	1246172	See, that wasn't in this one.
1246192	1248714	At least this game did not have the Flintstones or anything.
1250376	1250756	I don't know.
1251437	1254280	The licensing fee for a game like that would be nuts.
1254580	1256962	DarkTetsuya says there should be a LaughOlympics video game.
1257463	1258083	That might be cool.
1258143	1260726	But the licensing fee would be atrocious, I would think.
1260866	1267072	Well, it's all Hanna-Barbera, so I would think that LaughOlympics would probably be a lot better than Wacky Races.
1267652	1268893	Wacky Races sucked, so...
1270257	1270998	All right, that's that.
1285555	1288457	I guess to make sure you're not burning a copy of the game or something?
1288477	1289257	I don't know.
1309596	1312017	It doesn't work very well.
1312478	1319361	If I didn't want to play Spore Online, I could easily crack that stupid code with one little patch.
1319561	1323122	Unfortunately, I've already installed it on my system.
1323583	1324483	Not that it really matters.
1324523	1325684	I'm not playing the game anyway.
1327624	1336329	Well, a class action lawsuit has been filed against Electronic Arts this week over that DRM and specifically kind of targeting Securom.
1336349	1345614	This class action lawsuit is claiming that Spore contains, quote, a second undisclosed program called Securom, a form of digital rights management for computer games.
1346034	1347835	Consumers are not warned about the program.
1347875	1352157	The program installs without any notice and they cannot uninstall the program either.
1353157	1370781	The program is, quote, secretly installed at the command and control center of the computer, ring zero, or the kernel, and surreptitiously operated, overseeing function and operation on the computer, preventing the computer from operating under certain circumstances and or disrupting hardware operations.
1371201	1380903	So it was a class action lawsuit filed against Electronics Arts, who's put this game out there, basically saying, you are installing a second program without my consent on my computer.
1381123	1382203	That's basically the core of it.
1383619	1384540	And I agree with that.
1384660	1392346	I agree that that makes sense because they aren't saying, hey, we're installing this on here or giving you a way to uninstall it, say, if you uninstall the game.
1392546	1393747	It stays on your computer.
1394548	1395769	Forever.
1396930	1397630	What do you guys think?
1398171	1399732	What will become of this lawsuit?
1399752	1401433	And I posed this question in our chat room as well.
1401473	1403095	Do you think this lawsuit has any merit?
1403175	1404596	Is this a sue-happy America?
1405356	1406317	What's going to happen, you think?
1406818	1407238	Settlement?
1408942	1409342	Any thoughts?
1409542	1415446	Honestly, I think that they're going to have to settle, at least just to get people to shut up.
1416047	1419409	But other companies have been doing this for ages.
1419729	1432778	For example, I think Dell does the DNA program, I think, to see if you're... God, I can't remember what exactly it's about, but they install a program.
1432798	1435880	But then again, I guess if you buy a Dell, you know you're eventually going to get this on there.
1436500	1438762	But there should have... What?
1439342	1442465	I was just going to say that probably they're not going to end up getting any money out of this.
1442686	1455218	It's probably just going to be agreeing that... I think this has happened in the past with other games that had Secure ROM where the agreement was that there is an uninstall program but you have to get it from Secure ROM to uninstall the game.
1455238	1458261	But they keep changing the version so it doesn't work, I don't think, anymore.
1459262	1461324	I know it's not easy to uninstall it.
1462139	1466121	I think that there should have been something in the manual.
1466981	1473884	Or maybe just like a little icon on the box that has some sort of Securom logo on it or something.
1476065	1477766	I happen to have the box right here.
1478717	1481099	Dude, I'm sorry, I just have to interrupt with something hilarious.
1481119	1481979	Please, that's why you're here.
1482820	1492686	I was just, like, I was reading an article about how You Know Who was disbarred, and somebody made a cake and wrote, Dear You Know Who, congrats on the disbarment, you douchebag.
1494059	1495540	Hold on, you're getting to the next story.
1495560	1496400	You're getting a little ahead.
1496820	1497500	That's alright.
1498841	1502122	I'm looking at the box, and I'm looking at the inside of the box.
1502442	1505383	It's a little, you know, what's all in the game.
1505763	1507164	I'm looking at the back of the box.
1507204	1509925	I'm even looking at the fine print that gives the system requirements.
1510765	1512546	Internet connection is required.
1513086	1517048	EA terms and conditions and feature updates can be found at www.ea.com.
1518448	1520529	I don't see the word Secure ROM anywhere here on this box.
1521990	1522630	So they don't tell you.
1524766	1550849	I honestly, I do honestly think, I mean, you know, the primary rule is let the buyer beware but still, I think that if they are going to install something without your knowledge when you think you're getting a game and all of a sudden you're getting, you know, this other business even though it's to protect their information I honestly think that there should be some sort of warning so that the buyer can be aware and not beware, you know what I mean?
1551129	1553470	and not have to rely strictly on Amazon reviews.
1553910	1554370	Exactly.
1554590	1559211	The other thing, too, I mean, does your copy of Warhammer have SecureM on it?
1559231	1560232	Because it's also EA.
1561172	1561592	Who knows?
1561692	1562032	I don't know.
1562132	1568014	I mean, I'm looking at the box for Warhammer, which I also happen to have right here, and I don't think I see anything on here either.
1568074	1568994	But then again, would I?
1569114	1569694	Probably not.
1570215	1574256	Although I do notice a lot of the very same blah, blah, blah on here that I saw on the other box.
1574696	1574896	Yeah.
1575652	1582016	I don't know, I don't like the idea that... I mean, I don't have a problem with a program that's making sure my copy of the game I'm running is legit.
1582236	1582876	That's fine.
1583837	1589900	But the problem is, this program is also supposed to mess up your CD burning software or something like that.
1589960	1596384	Luckily, it hasn't with mine, because I've been able to burn DVDs quite easy.
1597525	1597605	Um...
1599074	1600835	You know, Drew Nami has a good point in our chatroom.
1600875	1602297	Warhammer doesn't need Securon.
1603078	1606861	It is impossible to play... Well, I mean, I guess never say never.
1607182	1611085	But virtually impossible to play this game without buying your own copy.
1611125	1615730	Because it being an MMO, you have to have a key to go online and play the game.
1615850	1618112	And it needs an internet connection by nature.
1618232	1619273	So it's very easily verifiable.
1619293	1620034	It doesn't matter.
1620294	1620855	It's a game.
1621075	1621596	It's a copy.
1621656	1621856	I mean...
1623248	1624933	They do that with Final Fantasy XI.
1624953	1630790	You have to have a copy, you know, a content code or something like that to prove that you bought, you know, the game, so...
1634079	1637580	TigerClaw asks, did the end user license agreement state anything about copy protection?
1637620	1638941	It may not mention about secure ROM.
1639181	1640601	TigerClaw said it did not.
1641401	1641701	Interesting.
1641961	1645602	Even if it did, I think they might have a claim that it's not visible enough.
1646182	1648423	How many people really read those end user license agreements?
1648443	1649183	I don't know.
1649243	1649523	Who knows?
1650684	1657625	Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy before us here on All Games Radio, says the Galactic Edition box also does not state secure ROM.
1657685	1658686	He has the Special Edition.
1659646	1659786	Um...
1661038	1661378	Let's see.
1661478	1666579	Frisbee says people actually checked the end-user license agreement and never saw Secure ROM.
1666639	1668440	Frisbee had another really good point here earlier.
1668460	1669960	I'm trying to find it.
1670740	1674361	You have to tell people when you install stuff in a PC it's an invasion of piracy.
1674761	1675861	TigerClaw also says this.
1676201	1679902	I hope this lawsuit goes through because digital rights management is bad enough as it is.
1680282	1684923	I wonder, though, when you install the game, there's probably an end-user... That's where that second discussion went on.
1685483	1687685	It's spyware.
1687825	1692710	It's a spyware or a trojan, basically, because it's a program that's being installed without you knowing.
1693070	1695332	And that is just not right.
1695372	1699556	Do you remember years ago when CDs, I believe it was Sony?
1699696	1701297	Yeah, the Sony Rootkit.
1701618	1701998	That's it.
1702058	1703259	Rootkit was what it was called.
1703920	1706642	There was a big stink over that, and they had to end up...
1707763	1733237	either replacing discs or something well they had to put an uninstalled program out there for this and people found out you could get around this by drawing a line with a sharpie pen on your disc to basically fuck up the data track on your CD because data tracks go at the end it's a little different I guess but here's the crazy thing about that I was actually reading about Rootkit on Wikipedia not that long ago did you know that not only could you go to the website to get the program
1734315	1739820	The Windows official... You know how Windows has their own spyware removal program or whatever that comes out every month?
1739860	1741201	Like sometimes you see it in Windows Update.
1741742	1745585	The rootkit removal ended up being a part of that months later.
1746406	1748168	So I just always thought that was kind of fascinating.
1748868	1750630	So, very interesting.
1752003	1754584	And yeah, GameGuru says it's a rootkit and no one warned it.
1755324	1757965	I'm wondering if this isn't going to go along the same route.
1758005	1761967	To me, that rootkit thing kind of set a precedent in this regard.
1762047	1766809	That's where I think that, yeah, this might be justified because you're installing extra shit that someone didn't ask for.
1768109	1778794	Well, if they're going to follow by previous... Because I do believe that, isn't it, once it hits the federal level, if it's gone through court, what, at least three times that...
1780413	1782934	It becomes a basically... Oh, God, I can't remember.
1783354	1784715	I took that law class a long time ago.
1785275	1786455	I'll get what you're saying, though.
1786495	1793078	But usually, if there's been a precedent set for it, they tend to stick by previous rulings.
1794338	1794659	All right.
1794979	1799701	Well, if you have some thoughts on this, you can join us in our chat room, or you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1799981	1800741	And we'll let Rob read it.
1802950	1804590	Alright, let's move on with the news.
1804610	1810651	I know Tiara gave us a hint of what's to come, but please, DarkSakura, give us the wonderful, glorious news that happened this week.
1810851	1814612	In baking news, there's been cakes made regarding... No.
1815392	1823854	Well, as stated by Sauce earlier, we have no more of he who shall not be named practicing law.
1824254	1829555	He has been permanently disbarred and he's already throwing a hissy fit and going...
1832495	1833135	Over the whole thing.
1834676	1843262	He's basically saying that it's a retaliation for a book he wrote about the Florida Supreme Court trying to...
1846721	1857246	Get past this faith-based activism against the American entertainment industry.
1857586	1862809	He's quoted saying this rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit.
1863109	1869252	With enemies this foolish Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has.
1869852	1870573	That's his statement.
1871613	1878036	Actdeft in chat is suggesting that we shall change the name from He Who Shall Not Be Named to He Who Shall Not Practice Law.
1878936	1880516	I endorse this.
1880837	1881837	I endorse it as well.
1881897	1882237	Loki?
1883197	1884498	I'm fine with that.
1884598	1887839	I just hope we don't have to talk to him anymore.
1887879	1889080	He Who Shall Not Practice Law.
1889380	1891420	I know, it is getting a little old, isn't it?
1892061	1893281	Yeah, it's already been.
1894021	1895602	It was a little old a long time ago.
1896830	1915886	Just though, and this is what I was saying when Bobby made his call to us earlier, is, I mean, keep in mind, this is the same guy who went after Two Life Crew back in the day, went after Ice-T for his cop killer thing, and basically, as far as I'm concerned, this man is anti-First Amendment.
1916046	1918588	You know what he needs to refocus his efforts on?
1920211	1925014	Like reality TV shows that appear on MTV, like The Real World and The Hills.
1925554	1927215	Those need to be taken off TV.
1928256	1933799	Even more though, going back to what I was trying to say about, I don't think he's specifically anti-First Amendment.
1934299	1937821	He's pro-First Amendment as long as it's whatever he wants to say.
1939540	1942002	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1965171	1972976	I'm actually, like I was saying earlier, I think this is a long time coming ever since, you know, the late 80s.
1973076	1974117	God, what is this now?
1974878	1977379	20 years this has been coming?
1977519	1988947	I'm finally glad to see, you know, basically the duct tape thrown over his mouth and, you know, hopefully he'll stop bitching and realize that no one really cares.
1989508	1990368	Maybe he'll take up knitting.
1991249	1991369	Huh?
1991389	1991689	We'll see.
1991889	1992970	I said maybe he'll take up knitting.
1994111	1994431	We'll see.
1995362	1996103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2009679	2010540	including this guy.
2011280	2013422	I suppose this is the biggest defense ever, huh?
2013442	2021527	It's like, the Florida people don't like me because I wrote a mean book about them.
2022648	2026851	No, they disbarred you because you're a big fucking moron.
2028092	2028472	The end.
2029687	2031008	Thank you for watching!
2048806	2052247	Hopefully we'll never have a story about this guy again, for real real.
2053047	2055748	One more time, the FUs of the week.
2057168	2059769	As inspired by a story about this guy.
2071712	2077354	I have a multiple part FU, and it begins with a certain event that occurred on Tuesday.
2078948	2086516	On Tuesday I was driving school, minding my own, and paying attention to the road, and then CRASH.
2087837	2093623	The Silver Lancer of Love is now the totaled out Silver Lancer of Death.
2094744	2096466	It is gone RIP Lancer.
2097166	2097707	My baby.
2098007	2098988	My poor, poor baby.
2101997	2104619	Yeah, and I did actually end up hurting my hip kind of bad.
2105099	2108901	I've been kind of limping about, but I'm going to see my chiropractor next week, which is Poppy.
2109842	2124291	And then as my week progresses, Dan ends up going into the hospital for, I had to spend like, what, three, four hours in the ER with Dan, with his knee being sprained.
2125411	2133934	So, it was just sort of one thing after another, but everything was happy when I went to the airport and picked us up.
2134594	2135535	It's been great.
2135795	2140997	Except for this morning when I had to spend four hours at the car dealership signing papers.
2141357	2144298	And it was the signing papers part that took longer than the test driving part.
2144918	2153242	However, I now have a happy Toyota vibe, as in Matrix with the Pontiac exterior.
2153543	2155384	Now, the big question is, what are you going to name it?
2155404	2157024	Because your last car was Vic Viper, right?
2158185	2162187	Well, my last car was Vic Viper, and the one before that was the Twindy.
2162607	2163688	So what's this one going to be now?
2163928	2165309	Whatever the ship and R-Type is.
2166509	2169051	Dan suggested that it should be Raider.
2169251	2171092	That way she would have a Pontiac vibe Raider.
2176590	2178031	I get it.
2178131	2180753	Maybe that'll be its secret.
2181213	2183074	It's not Lord British because it's not red.
2183114	2185116	Dan pointed that out to me because I was going to name it Lord British.
2186757	2187978	Nice.
2188118	2191160	If you named it Ribbon, it would be one letter away from Vibribbon.
2192221	2192761	Vibribbon?
2195111	2195892	Actdeft's Contributed Tonight
2223852	2225914	That's two pretty big deals there.
2225974	2227696	Add it on the wiki, my car has a name.
2227876	2230219	Alright, there you go.
2230399	2231460	Loki, your FU of the week.
2232381	2235144	My FU of the week goes to your aunt.
2236964	2238726	And, um, they're annoying.
2238826	2240067	Hey, what did my aunt do to you?
2240147	2243710	She's sitting in a house in the middle of Elk Grove somewhere, just tending to the pigs.
2243990	2249535	Hey, well that aunt's fine, but the other hunter that you have underneath this floor here, that kind of sucked.
2249915	2258642	I put the food, or I should say the trash, next to the mixing board, so if the sound starts to go out and we notice a big horde of ants, we'll know why.
2259523	2259843	All right.
2261592	2263955	My FU of the week goes to my gallbladder.
2264735	2265676	Because it sucks!
2266517	2269279	And it's like, I don't like you, Rob.
2269319	2272462	I'm going to get all inflamy and stuff inside you.
2272823	2274684	And you're going to have to have a surgery to take me out.
2274964	2277006	Thankfully, gallbladder surgery is no big deal.
2277066	2278608	I've had plenty of people reassure me it's...
2279068	2279648	Not a big deal.
2279688	2286169	It's just, you know, just the method of it all and having to get all the pre-screenings and having to go through it.
2286249	2292250	I'm going to be in bed for two weeks, which is going to suck because I won't be able to do the show, among other things.
2292590	2298712	But I should be able to get a whole lot of DS playing in at that time because, you know, I haven't reviewed a DS game on this program in like six months.
2299172	2307073	So that's going to be the blessing about gallbladder surgery is, damn it, I'm going to catch up on every single handheld game I've been waiting to catch up on in a long freaking time.
2307754	2309855	So F you to the gallbladder for hating me.
2310295	2314056	Sadly enough, Rob's gallbladder is easier to remove than secure, Rob.
2317137	2319798	You've been sitting here all night long with that punchline, haven't you?
2319818	2321699	Nope, just last minute.
2322879	2323640	Asshole.
2324340	2325740	Tiara, do you have any F yous of the week?
2326481	2330102	I would just like to say to Drew that you suck for not coming to my brunch yesterday.
2330802	2335044	So F you, Drew, for ruining my vacation by being a loser and not showing up.
2335624	2335744	Aww.
2337492	2338173	How sad.
2339456	2339777	Alright.
2342342	2342843	There you go.
2343023	2343745	Happy use of the week.
2345103	2348406	Nate432 says, Rob, you need to give the PSP some more love.
2348506	2353070	I do love the PSP, and you know I'm going to love it a whole lot more when it's the only way I can watch movies for a couple weeks.
2353391	2357615	So, hey, PSP is the perfect post-surgery device.
2357835	2358255	There you go.
2358335	2358776	How's that?
2358816	2361398	You get your movies, your music, and your games all in one.
2361919	2363200	There's your PSP love.
2364521	2364901	All right.
2366002	2368625	Securom is the new gator, says Jurnami.
2370180	2370900	Remember Gator?
2371420	2372241	Yeah, I remember Gator.
2372261	2372721	Good stuff.
2372881	2373701	Gator sucked.
2373761	2374221	Gator doesn't.
2374241	2375242	Whatever happened to Gator?
2375622	2376962	It's probably still around.
2377002	2378522	I'm going to look that up on Wikipedia right now.
2378603	2378883	All right.
2379463	2380243	Meanwhile, another story.
2380963	2386365	Meanwhile, tomorrow or today or whenever you're having a listen to this, Monday.
2387409	2395112	September 29th, Xbox Live Arcade will be... Or Xbox Live completely will be down the entire day.
2396112	2406296	24 hours so that they can do some necessary improvements to prep for the next Xbox experience.
2406916	2408417	Or new Xbox experience.
2409077	2411558	You know, with all the fancy avatars and...
2412558	2414119	Other crap that they're adding to it.
2414379	2420283	So that's not the day that it's coming out, but it will be the day that they're working on stuff.
2421544	2424766	You'll have to find some offline games to play during that time.
2427307	2427628	Wow.
2428888	2430749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2452660	2456282	Try to give you some dumb little program that would sneak Gator on there as part of it.
2456802	2457862	Well, yeah, that was it.
2457922	2460803	It was weather scope, precision time.
2461104	2461644	That was it.
2462064	2464485	Is the time on your computer accurate?
2465245	2466566	That was their big thing.
2467586	2468326	Well, here's the thing.
2469407	2471608	There was this all back and forth stuff.
2471808	2476730	In 2006, Claria said they were going to exit the adware business and focus on search technology.
2476970	2477690	Well, here's the thing.
2478090	2479231	September 26, 2008, two days ago,
2481932	2490983	Jelly Cloud, which is what Claria changed its name to in June, has laid off all its employees, shut down all operations, and has liquidated all assets.
2492084	2494727	So Gator officially bid it this week.
2495788	2498051	How do you like that for late-breaking news?
2499132	2501435	And I would have never known if we didn't joke about it on tonight's show.
2502981	2504762	So Xbox Live down for a full day, really?
2504943	2514310	Yeah, I had to make the preparations last week so we're ready to go back to playing System Link Saints Row 1.
2515111	2517833	That's what we're going to do on Monday.
2518554	2520435	I have to go a full day without Rock Band?
2521296	2521937	What am I going to do?
2522317	2522797	I'm just kidding.
2523278	2525840	Is Xbox Live going down a whole day really that big a deal?
2526701	2527141	I don't think so.
2527541	2528262	It won't be the end of the world.
2529776	2540021	It is a big deal if you happen to, I don't know, have a new system that requires you to be logged into Xbox Live so that it knows that you purchased certain things.
2541181	2544743	Otherwise they show up as demos or just don't work.
2545123	2554387	Oh yeah, that'll be bad for those folks that haven't done the resetting of their licenses and all that stuff.
2554407	2555468	Yeah, let's play more Mercenaries 2.
2556863	2557944	and Watch Heroes.
2573772	2575132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2597799	2598379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2628279	2628720	DarkSakura.com
2656653	2657673	Well, here's a thought.
2658814	2665176	If they had never teased this as being an element of the game, I... It would have looked really awesome.
2665336	2667796	It would have looked really awesome when it finally came out.
2668237	2675919	So in a way, I think the lesson to be learned here is don't tempt us with things that you're not going to be able to because this is the kind of stories that are going to happen.
2676419	2676739	You know?
2677379	2678900	Otherwise, people would have been none the wiser.
2678920	2684541	I bet you there still would have been a lot of anticipation over Fable 2 because, you know, Fable did have its fans on Xbox One.
2684962	2685242	You know?
2685262	2685302	So...
2686522	2688383	Just kind of a lesson to be learned, I suppose.
2688503	2692684	But still, at least they are patching it that soon.
2692724	2694385	At least it's not coming like a year later.
2694405	2694885	We hope.
2694945	2695766	This is in theory.
2696066	2696286	Yeah.
2696786	2706530	But, I mean, there are a lot of games that are put out by certain companies like EA that come out flawed and patches don't come that quick at all.
2707230	2711732	And I find it hard to believe that, oops, we just didn't catch some of these bugs.
2711972	2712452	Mercenaries 2.
2714793	2715133	It's just...
2716516	2717156	The Romantic
2740013	2743877	Take a villager on a perfect date or tag along to one.
2744478	2748522	Meaning that it looks like most achievements will be obtainable in co-op modes as well.
2748923	2754749	Which is kind of interesting because is that part of the programming where I guess once the trigger's hit, it's hit no matter who did it?
2755249	2761716	Or was that something that was always intended to try and get more people to play the game together or whatever?
2763117	2763937	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2791038	2792320	Quick comments from chat room.
2792340	2794002	There's quite a few comments coming in here.
2795224	2800371	Bobby Blackwolf says, I've never heard of a movie being taken out of the theaters to be given a new ending and put back in theaters.
2800771	2801272	Wait, wait, wait.
2801392	2802013	I have, I have.
2802033	2802614	28 days later.
2804039	2804359	Remember?
2804740	2807663	They re-released it with like the additional ending or the special ending?
2807823	2808063	Yeah.
2808303	2810766	Sometimes they do, I mean, you know, I get the point.
2810806	2813768	I think he's trying to say that you're doing an apples and oranges thing with that comparison.
2813889	2818733	But they do sometimes re-release movies with extra crap to try and get people to go see it a second time.
2818813	2820135	Or completely change it all around.
2820175	2820955	Thank you, George Lucas.
2821296	2821416	But...
2822677	2823418	I guess that's true.
2824298	2824578	Let's see.
2824958	2829401	Gerardabo says, but are people really not going to play Fable 2 because there's no co-op in it?
2829501	2830001	I think not.
2830061	2830622	It's still Fable.
2831062	2832463	I think at the end of the day, he's right.
2833283	2833703	You're right.
2834824	2837666	Anybody that was going to buy the game is still going to buy it because they know it is coming.
2837926	2841548	And anybody that wasn't going to buy the game is just going to throw this onto the list of what they don't like.
2841568	2848091	At least they came out and said that the online co-op isn't in there instead of releasing it with the online co-op and it doesn't work.
2848532	2850273	And then go, oops, we've got to patch it later.
2850413	2850613	True.
2851982	2852423	Very true.
2852923	2857666	So, you know, honestly, at the end of the day, is this going to change anything about Fable 2?
2858166	2858566	Probably not.
2858886	2859246	Probably not.
2860107	2863529	But, will this maybe set a really bad precedent?
2863869	2866190	That's what we're all kind of... Wait, I don't think so.
2866210	2868392	The precedent's already been set a long time ago.
2868412	2874015	I mean, now that we have consoles that can patch games, that doesn't mean that the game has to come out perfect.
2875444	2877426	And not that it really mattered before that either.
2879687	2893358	I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of the games that came out before the 360 and stuff like that, there weren't as many glitches and problems because they spent more time testing them and making sure that they worked right.
2893478	2898322	Now it doesn't matter because if people discover glitches later on, we'll just go and fix it.
2900143	2901104	I think that's kind of lazy.
2901264	2905007	It kind of sucks that you buy a product and it doesn't work correctly.
2906654	2908075	because of sheer laziness.
2908896	2911497	Sounds like there will be a lot of people that want to call in and talk about this later.
2911717	2912718	We've got to keep it moving though.
2912758	2919222	We're getting into the show here and we've got a lot of stories to still cover like whatever DarkSakura is going to talk about next.
2920080	2929866	Well, it looks like, you know how people were saying that the 360 wasn't necessarily so popular in Japan, but it looks like it overtook the PS3, actually, again.
2930866	2939271	With the recent price cut, it went down, it actually managed to get out 13,777 units, as opposed to PS3's 8,156.
2939351	2941753	So, it's seriously giving it the smackdown.
2950498	2956161	However, in software titles, it's still basically in Nintendo's pocket.
2957662	2973352	For software, Pokemon Platinum is the top seller, then Dragon Ball Origins, Rhythm Tengoku Gold, and the top three are all DS games, followed by Trusty Bell, Chopin's Dream on PS3, the reprise.
2975123	2982708	So Microsoft really needs to be, like, praising, you know, whatever deity they believe in for Tales of Vesperia right about now, right?
2982868	2983428	Pretty much.
2983748	2988531	I mean, well, following down even the next two games after, that are more Nintendo games.
2988591	2993154	Quiz Magic Academy DS and Wii Fit are five and six, respectively.
2993254	2997257	Seven is a Katakyo Hitman Reborn Battle Arena on PSP.
2998077	3000139	Eighth is Wiz Samurai Portable PSP.
3000699	3003741	Nine, One Piece Unlimited Cruise on Wii and then Mario Kart Wii.
3004401	3009763	So it's very much dominated by Nintendo.
3009783	3018285	But as far as hardware sales, number one is the DS, two is the Wii, three is PSP, four Xbox 360, five PS3, and six PS2.
3018385	3021787	Which is actually still impressive, selling over 7,000 units.
3024535	3029116	Interesting comment from chat, and I apologize in advance for horribly mispronouncing your name, which I'm sure I'm going to do.
3029696	3035178	Hephaestus says, I love the fact that 360 outselling PS3 in Japan for a week is news.
3035578	3037198	It kind of is, in a way.
3037618	3050862	I mean, it really is that, wow, the 360, because a lot of folks say, oh, Xbox is failing in Japan, Microsoft is failing, they don't know what they're doing, da-da-da, or that it's never going to sell in Japan, and then finally it takes one really, really good game
3051462	3053784	for that audience to really start moving these systems.
3054324	3058548	The turnaround is somewhat notable.
3059649	3063932	The question is, will it have momentum, or is this just going to be a one-trick pony?
3064452	3070137	Still, though, that's more than twice as many units that went out.
3071318	3072559	I want to say that
3074113	3095076	Perhaps if, you know, if it basically, it does have to do with Squeenix support, if I think that they might put the effort into trying to get more of those major party developers, at least for the Japanese market, to try to get more things on their systems, you know, that might help them out in the long run if they can keep that kind of support.
3097591	3103975	I think they need to throw a lot of money at Capcom to get another Monster Hunter game exclusive for the 360.
3104035	3105856	That'll sell plenty of systems.
3105876	3106597	Or Fire Emblem.
3108078	3110819	Fire Emblem will never be on that system.
3110839	3112340	I mean, not Fire Emblem.
3113962	3115102	Because that's a Nintendo title.
3115142	3115903	I don't know what I was thinking.
3115983	3118044	I was thinking actually what you were saying.
3119225	3120126	It's getting the name mixed up.
3120146	3121867	Alright.
3121887	3122067	Alright.
3122540	3123321	Alright, let's move on.
3140934	3147801	What we got after the countdown was done is a teaser for a Halo 3 campaign expansion.
3147881	3158952	And we know this because on Xbox Live, the description for the video that's on there is a new Halo 3 campaign experience.
3159673	3161535	But what exactly this...
3162916	3164298	Experience will be, who knows.
3165139	3168824	The thoughts are it's not going to be Master Chief as the main character.
3169826	3171909	And actually they have a whole bunch of...
3173004	3174645	Breakdown on the trailer and stuff.
3175406	3178589	I know on Xbox, was it on 360 Fanboy?
3179069	3181011	They had a pretty cool video breakdown there.
3181311	3183713	Obsessive fans analyzing each and every frame.
3183894	3184154	I know.
3184174	3184574	Awesome.
3184654	3190660	And then, of course, along with analyzing every single frame, they thought that they found a date within the movie itself.
3191040	3194883	And, of course, it was January 6, 2009, which would be a Tuesday.
3195584	3198386	So this might be possibly coming soon.
3199247	3202188	In January, I guess we'll have to see, but that's kind of exciting.
3202208	3206790	At least they're going to be expanding the game some, in case it's gotten a little stale.
3207250	3208770	Free expansion, hopefully?
3209651	3217354	I don't think so, but I think this is actually kind of like Shivering Isles or something like that.
3218074	3220515	Something of that size, because it's a whole new portion of the game.
3220695	3224316	That's kind of neat to see something like that in a non-RPG type game, though.
3224456	3226417	Kind of neat to see the extended life of the game.
3227093	3227733	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3247643	3265927	to be honest I haven't ever I mean I've played Halo 2 a little bit and Halo 1 multiplayer a little bit but I never really actually played through the storylines of those so I couldn't really tell you what the hell that was going on in the trailers but it looked cool and it's um interesting I mean this will probably mean a lot more to a Halo fan so
3267608	3267828	HALO MMO
3288780	3300423	They were working on a MMO centered in the Halo universe and apparently even some pictures have surfaced from what the Halo MMO was supposed to look like and it kind of looked like wow in the Halo universe.
3300483	3301423	It's kind of interesting.
3301483	3304384	It looked to be kind of simple like World of Warcraft is.
3304564	3308485	Very similar layout for those that play Warcraft or even Warhammer Online.
3308545	3310545	Actually the interface almost looks more like Warhammer Online to me.
3311545	3312086	Kind of the way it is.
3312106	3316787	You can see characters wheeling dual swords as well as guns and all that stuff.
3316827	3316967	So
3318971	3319752	Thanks for watching!
3349632	3350813	I'm going to miss Ensemble.
3369492	3372196	Sorry to pour salt in the wound there.
3372997	3373837	It's very interesting, too.
3374138	3380405	You don't often hear about what these studios are necessarily working on, the secret projects, when these studios are closed.
3380425	3383369	So it's kind of neat that we got to hear a little something about it.
3384045	3385766	Dancing Stage Supernova 2, Playstation 2
3414109	3422462	FIFA 09 on damn near everything Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations on DS after that
3425663	3427244	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3452626	3457169	Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, the Sonic DS made by BioWare, coming to the DS.
3458689	3464673	And also, Silent Hill Homecoming, coming to the PC, 360, and PS3 this week.
3465353	3466334	It's pretty awesome.
3466894	3470596	Pipe Mania, coming out on Wii, 360, and PC.
3471917	3475719	I guess it's on the 360, maybe that's an Xbox Live Arcade game.
3479581	3480321	I haven't heard that one.
3480602	3481262	Let's see here.
3482637	3485311	There's a lot of games that are coming out.
3487254	3489275	DT Carnage on PSP Car Combat Game

3516084	3521009	Let's see, we've got a bunch of games coming out.
3521330	3522531	Some of the highlights though.
3522551	3526495	Let's see here.
3528697	3529959	Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
3531954	3533815	Let me read this chat comment really quick because it's funny.
3533855	3534556	I load for real.
3535256	3538498	Actdeft says, Silent Hill got a 6.5 by IGN, I think.
3538538	3540399	It makes a little annoyed face.
3540799	3543681	And Frisbee says, IGN gets a 6.5 sometimes.
3545002	3545202	Nice.
3545962	3551306	Supposedly, I guess on PC, and I thought this already came out already, but it says Limbo of the Lost is coming.
3552266	3558050	And if you remember that god-awful song they made you guys listen to a little bit ago.
3559070	3559991	Yeah, that was from that game.
3560731	3560871	And...
3562659	3563980	Lastly, let's see here.
3564760	3567541	Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate for PC.
3569683	3571023	We Cheer on the Wii.
3573644	3576006	And let's see here.
3576086	3581188	Lastly, Harvest Moon, Tree of Tranquility on the Wii.
3582829	3584090	Goody, more Harvest Moon.
3584250	3584550	Yay!
3586129	3586469	All right.
3586869	3587250	Is that it?
3587510	3587770	All right.
3587850	3590171	Let's move over to Japan where it's kind of a slower week.
3590211	3595573	There's not a whole lot of new stuff coming out, but there is Raiden 4 coming out on the Xbox 360.
3595853	3598114	So if you like your Raiden games, there's a brand new one.
3598134	3599515	I didn't even know there was one in development.
3599575	3600015	There you go.
3600375	3600835	Coming out on the 360.
3601796	3603096	Moving over to the PlayStation 3.
3603437	3609179	Not a lot of new stuff, but you do get some price reductions on Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion and Warhawk are moving into the best series.
3609979	3614381	As well as, hey, if you need it, a new Dusk Guard filter coming out in black and white.
3614421	3615102	Dusk Guard Filter 3.
3615822	3618343	DustGuard Filter 3 on the Nintendo Wii.
3618363	3622085	GQ Powerful Major League 3 is the only new game coming out this week.
3622125	3624186	It's a new game from Konami.
3624306	3626867	It comes out this week on the Nintendo Wii.
3636272	3637312	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3661224	3666247	Unknown Soldier, Mokuba no Hoku comes out this week in Japan.
3666787	3675932	As well as Nakamura, Sumiko, Tetai, Shidou, Shin, Twig, Test, One High, One Fun, DS Lesson from the Rocket Company.
3676272	3678954	I'm trying to figure out what exactly is the lesson that will be learned in this game.
3679474	3679774	Let's see.
3679794	3681976	It looks like it might be writing of some sort.
3682336	3682936	Oh, it's English.
3683176	3683596	It's English.
3683797	3684317	Learning English.
3686741	3688004	DarkSakura.com
3697353	3698394	Not a whole lot.
3698614	3700516	Looks like there's about three new games here.
3700916	3713485	To Love, Rue Trouble, Doki Doki, Rinkai Gakuhen comes out on the PSP, as well as Iki Tosen, Eloquent Fist comes out, regular and limited edition.
3713625	3722132	To make a correction to the comment in the chatroom that we had, Silent Hill Homecoming hasn't been rated or reviewed by...
3724316	3752694	IGN yet they do have one press rating which is from and that is a 6.5 that's from the official Xbox magazine so all your hate needs to be directed to the official Xbox magazine at this time IGN you can hate on it a little bit later alright that's it for Japanese release dates well how about more news cause no good news is good good news how about it anyway well um
3755461	3761203	Hideo Kojima is the hero of many, many a gamer for giving us the Metal Gear franchise.
3762103	3772105	And he's saying that he's got ideas for Metal Gear Solid 5, three concepts, but he doesn't want anyone to use them because that means he has to get involved and he doesn't want to.
3773206	3777607	He said he was going to be stepping back out of Metal Gear Solid, the whole series.
3777927	3781768	But honestly, I think that...
3783439	3785180	He should have some involvement with it.
3785420	3787061	It was his story from the beginning.
3787121	3803130	I don't think that starting a story and leaving it in the hands of other people, especially if you've controlled it so far, it could probably have less of a bizarre ending than Metal Gear Solid 4 had, maybe, but I don't know.
3803411	3805172	I liked his weird storytelling.
3805712	3811015	Well, I can tell you what one of his ideas were for the new Metal Gear Solid game, and I'll give you...
3811918	3813359	A little bit of a vague idea here.
3814500	3821365	Basically, a couple of Snake's cronies will be coming to visit him.
3822606	3826930	Unfortunately, when they arrive there, they will figure out that he's dead.
3828351	3837097	To which they have to convince everyone around him that he's still alive by moving his arms and stuff and hanging out on the beach and that kind of fun stuff.
3838158	3840260	He's not getting the weekend at Bernie's Treatment.
3842328	3843328	I thought it was Dead or Alive.
3843348	3845510	The most dorkest thing I've ever heard.
3845891	3847832	Okay, here's the thing though.
3847892	3853177	I mean, it's interesting because he might have actually really meant it this time when he said he wasn't doing another Metal Gear game.
3853197	3854298	Because doesn't he always say that?
3854338	3855079	Like, I'm not going to do it.
3855279	3855799	I'm not going to do it.
3855899	3856580	No, I'm not going to do it.
3856620	3857701	Fine.
3858942	3863926	Now he's kind of like, this kind of is like, well, I don't really want to do it.
3864026	3867729	But if, you know, they wanted me to do it, I have an idea.
3867749	3867830	Yeah.
3868496	3872002	Well, there was some other type of experimental game that he was working on.
3872863	3879333	But, I mean, as long as he writes this... Sorry.
3879914	3881537	I think we need a Solid Snake party game.
3882418	3883499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3907672	3911834	Hefeistus in chat says, it's like, ooh, please beg me to do it and I'll reluctantly agree.
3912774	3914074	It's kind of what this amounts to.
3915395	3915615	Nice.
3917095	3921997	Well, we'll see if he ends up coming back in a larger capacity or if he really means it this time.
3922077	3927419	I honestly think he really means it, but he's not going to be able to resist contributing in some way.
3927679	3929540	But he's just going to probably scale back his involvement.
3929580	3929840	We'll see.
3929860	3931441	Oh, yeah, the weekend at Bernie's thing.
3931481	3933501	That's comedy gold, man.
3933841	3934522	It'll be awesome.
3936063	3942268	Anyways, there's something out there that you can play for free on your PS3.
3942309	3942929	That's right.
3943530	3948074	There is actually an MMO available in Japan called Angel Love Online.
3948754	3950836	And it is a free-to-play MMO.
3951817	3958864	And there are instructions online to allow you to set up your own account and basically create your own account.
3960697	3961438	I guess login.
3961498	3970790	If you don't have a PlayStation Network login for Japanese PlayStation Network, then you can create one and also help you create a login for this game.
3973069	3983254	To create your Japanese PlayStation Network login, the easiest way to do that is actually go to a website called JapanesePSN.com and they'll walk you through it.
3983894	3991857	And as far as creating your own login for this game, you can actually go to PS3Fanboy.com.
3991877	3993458	They have an article on there for that.
3993638	3994138	And also...
3995419	4008987	NeoGAF.com their forums there's another article the game itself actually looks a little bit like Ragnarok online kind of except really like chibi with a bunch of people like are you trying to just get Tiara and Jamie interested in this game
4010490	4013472	Not really, I mean, but I'm just saying, you know, hey, it's a free-to-play game.
4013592	4015153	I don't really know what the point of the game is.
4015453	4018536	There is someone riding a giant beetle, so, I mean, that's kind of cool.
4018656	4021518	Oh, and there's another giant, like, frog or something.
4021638	4023779	But lots of people dressed up really weird.
4024079	4026921	Someone's in a giant cat monster, or cat robot thing.
4027682	4030804	So, yeah, I'm sure this will appeal to somebody.
4030904	4033826	I don't know what the point of this game is or purpose, because it's all in Japanese.
4033946	4035287	So, haha, funny.
4035747	4036247	But, um...
4037108	4037769	Yeah, check it out.
4037789	4038209	It's free.
4038890	4040891	So, free is awesome.
4040931	4042633	And if it sucks, hey, you know what?
4042653	4044594	At least this game looks a little bit better than yours.
4047677	4048598	Is that going to be your new thing?
4048618	4049879	Well, at least it's better than yours.
4049959	4051140	Yes, it is better than yours.
4051600	4052661	Angel Love Online.
4054062	4056044	Also better than Yaris are price drops!
4056124	4056684	Hooray!
4057245	4065973	And it was rumored that a big ol' price drop is coming for the Sony PlayStation 3, but it looks like it's actually mostly kind of contained to Blockbuster.
4066593	4069496	It looks like they appear to be unloading some extra consoles there.
4069756	4071418	This happened on Friday and it was caught from a
4071858	4072919	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4095040	4095420	and DarkSakura.
4119706	4125062	They're going to have to drop the price of those because the new 160 is coming out in like November sometime.
4125624	4125785	So...
4127520	4128901	Yeah, and that's not surprising.
4128941	4133924	But yeah, this is not the price drop you're looking for there, not dropping the system down $200 or anything like that.
4134384	4135684	It's just clearing them out.
4136185	4145370	Right, because with all these games you usually have to install on the systems, you probably want to get a bigger hard drive now that we're learning what it's for, and that is installing the games on your drive, basically.
4145710	4147791	Which reminds me, I need to get a bigger hard drive for the Xbox.
4147831	4152574	My 20 gig drive is finally starting to fill up to the point where I can't fit much more on it.
4153274	4155216	and it's because of freaking Rock Band.
4155576	4159780	I have been kind of clearing out old games and stuff and I just, I have a lot of crap on there.
4160100	4164344	You know, keep in mind, seven of the 20 gigs gets taken up with that emulation stuff.
4165065	4169489	So, I think I might finally have to cave and get, you know, a bigger drive.
4169789	4174013	Let's say, you know, hell freezes over and I want to reinstall Final Fantasy XI on my Xbox someday.
4174093	4175834	I just wouldn't be able to do it without a bigger hard drive.
4176955	4177256	We'll see.
4177336	4178377	Or get a second hard drive.
4179458	4179778	I don't know.
4180714	4181194	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4209034	4236541	on the 360 yep and movies from $2.99 and up $2.99 and up for the HD movies they were still too expensive and I didn't want yeah you know the $2.99 ones are usually kind of crappy things that aren't even real movies usually those types of things that just show off the power of HD players like you know National Geographic you know Discover the World and stuff which you know you might want to watch once to go ooh and ah but that's about it right so anyway sorry tangent my bad
4237296	4239818	What is a show without tangents?
4240979	4256270	Well, here's some good news for all of our Sonic fans, and hopefully it won't be like some of the previous ones, but Yuji Naka is working on something with Prope, which is the new development studio.
4256290	4262434	They have a website posted that says that it's a new experience that can be played by penguins.
4265953	4266895	How do penguins play video games?
4266915	4268097	But it'll be something with Sega.
4269018	4271042	And I mean, maybe it'll be Sonic.
4271122	4273206	Maybe it'll be Outrun.
4273266	4274047	I doubt it's Sonic.
4274067	4274989	It's got to be something new.
4276091	4277633	It's a game where he makes snow cones.
4277653	4278134	Pengo!
4279332	4280333	Maybe you build igloos.
4280553	4281053	It'd be fun.
4281354	4284256	But the site... Frostbite 2008.
4284656	4286237	I'll link it in the chat room.
4287278	4293623	But it's got this little flash thingy with a penguin in front of a screen.
4293783	4298667	It's actually at probe.sega.jp.
4298887	4299728	Just go look.
4300468	4304412	Hopefully this means that the game will involve penguins because that'll be cute.
4304512	4305232	I love penguins.
4306253	4307094	That's what I'm hoping for.
4308514	4312817	It looks basically like a blurred out TV, like a widescreen TV in the background.
4313337	4319260	And then a penguin in front of it with the exclamation point and a question mark and a word bubble.
4320080	4321381	And it's looking off to the side.
4321621	4324063	And the penguin doesn't look very confused.
4324103	4325083	He just looks flappy.
4326524	4327564	But Rob likes penguins.
4328985	4329746	I love penguins.
4329766	4335009	That's why I'm hoping that it's a whole new... I hope it is like a new version of Pango or something.
4335029	4337570	It means the next Sega game will be released only on Linux.
4339454	4340136	I somehow doubt that.
4340497	4340717	I know.
4342381	4344085	It'll be written in Penguinese.
4344747	4346872	You cannot understand it right.
4347033	4348276	You have to pay for the game in fish.
4350894	4353776	Alright, we'll see in a few more days when they announce it.
4354937	4374392	Something else that's going to be coming, possibly soon, would be the new Sonic Genesis collections, which is supposed to be coming out on the 360 and PS3, according to some retail listings dug up, and it says each with ship dates of February 2009.
4374652	4377394	Hmm, what could that be?
4377534	4379016	Could that actually be coming out?
4380600	4384622	I don't know, retail listings, I wouldn't have seen that either, would I?
4386943	4403870	But yeah, so, I don't know, it's probably a collection of all the Sonic games It's supposed to be pretty cheap from what I hear And I'd imagine it probably just has the Sonic Sega Genesis games Don't we already kind of have the Genesis games on Xbox Live Arcade?
4403890	4405911	Yeah, it's the Sonic Mega Collection or something like that, you know
4406872	4407332	Thanks for watching!
4426653	4427913	Frisbee echoes my thoughts exactly.
4427974	4428834	A Sega compilation.
4428854	4430775	That's called the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox Ones.
4430815	4431815	It's like we've seen all this before.
4431855	4433996	Yeah, but the GameCube and Xbox.
4434016	4435857	So now we get achievements.
4435877	4436837	Exactly.
4439378	4439658	All right.
4440322	4444626	Well, you know, Sonic is a classic though, despite the fact that they release it over and over and over again.
4444666	4445607	It still is a classic game.
4446048	4450052	And we love to pay Classic Games some tribute here on this program.
4450432	4455116	And that's why every week DarkSakura likes to bring us her classic video game of the week.
4455497	4463605	So DarkSakura, please go into the Dusty Archives of Gaming and find a game that should be highlighted this week on the program in the Classic Game of the Week segment.
4465680	4468664	Today's classic game is Mega Man 2.
4469505	4475012	And I'm saying Mega Man 2 instead of the first one because honestly I think Mega Man 2 was a much better game.
4476193	4479398	So if you want to roll that beautiful bean footage, Rob.
4479998	4480479	Mega Man 2
4484966	4486727	How many of us remember that noise?
4487087	4488887	This is Metal Man's music.
4490768	4495129	But basically, it's, you know, it's... Okay, who in our chatroom does not know Mega Man?
4495229	4496329	Do I have to really explain it?
4496889	4508773	You're a little blue robot, and you go through all these different stages, fighting off these cute little robotic enemies, and you pick up power-ups on the way, like a big giant Mega Man head.
4511149	4514691	Also, if you don't know who Mega Man is, he's like Bender from Futurama.
4515111	4515552	Totally.
4519034	4523196	At any rate, as you make it through the level, you have to fight a robot master.
4523216	4526558	Ew, they have whips and chains and... never mind.
4527418	4537144	At any rate, basically you have to fight these different robots that each have a different ability and their theme of their stage is, you know, goes along with whatever their ability is.
4537464	4539425	Like, Mega Man shoots out metal blades.
4540826	4551291	and Bubble Man shoots out bubbles that don't do much except for the very end of the game where there's only three places that you use the weapon at all.
4551972	4557595	Although there are some robots that if you do it in a certain order, some are weaker to others.
4559215	4562277	This music here is Quick Man Stage, which is like the single most annoying stage.
4563617	4568360	Unless you have fantastic timing, it's almost impossible to get past those beans that shoot across.
4568846	4569688	Use Flashman power.
4569908	4570970	That's right, use Flashman power.
4571230	4573254	However, Dan can do it without using Flashman's thing.
4573274	4573995	That's insane.
4574536	4575157	I've seen him do it.
4575217	4577081	I did not believe he could do it until I saw him do it.
4578721	4581484	And plus you need that Flashman power to beat the boss.
4581604	4583026	It really helps beating the boss.
4583246	4586649	Because you can take like a third of his life away instantly if you have all the Flashman power.
4586890	4596960	Yeah, like I was saying earlier, each of the enemies in the game have a particular weakness to the other bosses' master's powers.
4597681	4598481	So you can...
4599482	4606349	Except for like Airman, which you can only really get him with the regular shot and the metal blades work on him too.
4606369	4608731	I think you're supposed to use Leaf Shield if you have it.
4608931	4609351	I think.
4609812	4610492	I might be wrong.
4610552	4611954	I always just started off with Airman.
4612154	4614116	I either started off with Metal Man or Airman.
4614516	4615437	Yeah, I started with Metal Man.
4615757	4616778	That person just did it, see?
4619360	4621983	Yeah, you have to have impeccable timing to be able to get past this part though.
4622043	4623264	You just have to have it memorized.
4624056	4629103	We'll have to link that one in the chatroom, because I was very... And he even got the power-up, too.
4629203	4630344	This is the part that always got me.
4631406	4631726	Yeah.
4632387	4633929	Oh, no, it was... Yeah, it was this one, sorry.
4635992	4638535	Anyway, I know this is really great radio, but I...
4641309	4644010	This is actually one of my all-time favorite games.
4644070	4645490	It is up there on the list.
4646090	4652012	I even got so bored one day that I cracked the code by myself just experimenting with it.
4652592	4659814	The password code where you put in the red blocks and blue blocks wherever to get past whatever and get all of the power-ups and everything.
4660214	4662855	And I wrote it on a pair of torn up blue jeans.
4663855	4666116	So I actually had it rolled up like a scroll.
4666577	4667197	Scroll and everything?
4667257	4668137	Scroll.
4668157	4669198	Like a scroll and everything.
4669238	4673280	It was my special thing to get past that.
4674261	4687628	The other cool thing about this one is that they actually had to fight to get this one out since the first Mega Man didn't have, well, Rockman, I should say, in Japan, didn't really have that big of a following.
4688348	4701815	But since they put more work into the game and improved the graphics and the overall play of it, they were able to get this out and since then it's become basically a staple of almost anyone's classic collection.
4702515	4710619	Of course it spawned so many sequels that we've lost count, including a couple of fighting games, the Power Battles, and a few...
4712120	4716541	Other, uh, there's even the whole, um, uh, Mega Man EXE series.
4716861	4718522	You know, we wouldn't have that without this.
4719062	4721963	Even though I think we'd be better off without it, because I don't really care for it personally.
4723203	4729064	Um, it also made, um, GameSpot's, uh, greatest games of all time.
4729544	4733425	It was number 33 in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever list.
4734566	4734646	Um...
4736283	4737565	It also had a novelization.
4738045	4740708	They released a novel of it.
4742010	4749038	I guess it was only in the U.S., but it was put out by Scholastic like every other dance kid's book in the late 80s and early 90s.
4749058	4751581	Was that the same guy who did the Blaster Master books and all that stuff?
4752012	4753054	I... It doesn't say.
4753454	4753675	Huh.
4753755	4754256	It doesn't say.
4756499	4759903	It also had, like, one of the best worst cover arts ever.
4761025	4763588	You know, because it had him holding the gun and everything and had the visor.
4763829	4765010	It was just stupid and ugly.
4766072	4768435	Also, there was a Navi mode in the game.
4769196	4789790	If you got the Rockman Complete Works discs that came out on PlayStation in 1999 in Japan, which were the NES versions with the tons of bonuses, but also had a sort of, I guess a commentary kind of mode for playing through the game.
4790350	4793412	It was also included in the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.
4793813	4796935	It was on PS2 and GameCube and Xbox.
4799776	4800977	Again, it's one of my favorite games.
4801017	4803077	And also, this is the game that gave us Rush, remember?
4803797	4808379	You could get the platform, or the jet, or the other Rush thing that I forget.
4809839	4811179	What was it, the one that wrote up walls?
4812340	4812740	Number 3.
4813120	4814040	Yeah.
4814820	4819662	And it also had the e-tank, so you could get your full refill system and everything.
4820562	4826804	And this is the one that I think set the stage for the releases afterwards.
4827782	4830644	And it's really the one that Mega Man 9 is even modeled after.
4830724	4833925	Because you don't have the power slide or a lot of that stuff that came even in 3.
4834606	4835626	You don't see that in 9.
4835686	4839128	I mean, 9 is in some ways a direct sequel to 2, not to 8.
4840289	4841869	As far as the way it plays, it does.
4842810	4848413	But to be technical, there was actually... For 8 and 9, there was a game that came in between.
4849293	4854236	And I do want to say that it was Mega Man and Bass...
4856423	4861487	Yeah, when Mega Man and Bass came out, it was actually under development.
4861507	4863088	It was titled Rock 8.5.
4864809	4872454	So, 9 is supposed to be a direct sequel, I mean an actual full sequel to 8 following through that whole thing.
4873355	4882441	But honestly, this is the one I will sit back and go, and for a little while, I can't do it now because of course it's been a while since I've played this game regularly.
4882761	4884503	I used to be able to do the dragon part blindfolded.
4886482	4888404	Because it's the same pattern, if you know the pattern.
4889124	4894930	I mean, I would die sometimes, but if you know the pattern, then it wasn't really all that hard, because it did the same damn thing every time.
4898013	4902056	Of course, if you don't have all your... That's more impressive than being able to do the quick man beams, in my opinion.
4903257	4911225	And also, if you don't know how to do... Well, if you don't save all your crash blocks to that one, like, right towards the end, then you're screwed for the whole rest of the game.
4912734	4913935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4938630	4945778	although I would recommend instead of getting it on virtual console just get, even though I know people at the GameCube version of the Mega Man Collection just get the Mega Man Collection
4947083	4948744	No, you have to have the Nintendo.
4975049	4976351	Whoa, what is going on over there?
4976371	4977593	I dropped the microphone.
4978514	4980938	Jamie's about ready to just run out of here now that it's break time.
4980998	4981378	No, I'm kidding.
4981639	4983742	Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4990342	4991103	XBOX 360 CODE FOR FEEDING FRENZY 2
5015783	5021087	All you have to do is send us an email and please make sure it's an email we can get back to you at because that's where we're sending the code.
5021107	5022027	If you win, it's feeding frenzy 2.
5046043	5073239	Giveaway here on Orange Lounge Radio We'll give that away next week live Gaming Radio, so uncensored That even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us Orange Lounge Radio And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday evening September the 28th of 2008 if you can believe it October's almost here and then pretty soon it'll be 2009
5075486	5076407	Where does the time go?
5076487	5077087	I don't know anymore
5105973	5106513	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5126187	5131850	Apparently, one of the routes that they're going with this is I guess it's going to support using SD memory cards.
5132411	5138774	So you'll be able to transfer stuff back and forth from your Wii system to your DS.
5138834	5143837	You'll be able to load songs onto it as well through that.
5145358	5148459	And the newspaper looks like Nikkei.
5150009	5154034	They are expecting that the system will be priced under 20,000 yen.
5154274	5160661	And the Nintendo DS Lite currently is priced at 16,800 yen in Japan.
5164028	5174990	And it looks like the new DS will launch first in Japan with other countries seeing an allocation of several hundred thousand units before anybody else overseas sees them.
5176130	5191513	Interesting and funny because this kind of goes in with the other story that's come out a couple days ago about how Nintendo will be doing a media event on October 2nd and 3rd.
5194005	5198767	Hmm, a little interesting that this comes out in a newspaper.
5200048	5203649	And I don't think that they would run rumors.
5205070	5210132	And what other announcements could we possibly expect from this media event?
5210212	5215275	Because this is, I think, their opportunity to save face from E3.
5217810	5224791	My guess, which is interesting, my guess would be, of course, announcing Disaster Day of Crisis since it's already out in Japan.
5225371	5226532	Europe is right around the corner.
5226552	5227912	They haven't announced a date for the U.S.
5228032	5228312	yet.
5229412	5235453	And the other thing I wouldn't be surprised if I saw was that they're publishing Conduit.
5235813	5241954	Because if you notice, for a game that doesn't have a publisher, there's sure a lot of screenshots coming out every single day.
5242374	5245255	And kind of the whole marketing campaign is in full force.
5246135	5252517	Kind of makes you go, hmm, why would they be trying to market this game so strongly right now when they don't even have a publisher yet?
5252717	5255338	Because usually the publisher is the one that does the marketing for them.
5256819	5259820	Interesting to think about that maybe this game is right around the corner.
5261100	5262300	And maybe Nintendo's publishing it.
5262560	5265081	After all, it was in Nintendo's booth at PAX.
5267382	5267902	Might be a guess.
5269203	5273104	Well, hey, before the show, and that DS is supposed to be out this year.
5274332	5279815	So that could be, you know, that's probably some of the strongest evidence as to why they would need a special press conference to announce it.
5279995	5280175	Yeah.
5280295	5281096	It's coming out this year.
5281816	5282316	Very interesting.
5282336	5282816	What do you think?
5282856	5285938	Would you buy a DS for the camera and the music and all this stuff?
5286058	5286298	Maybe.
5286879	5287139	Maybe?
5287599	5287839	Maybe.
5287919	5288779	I have to see if it's worth it.
5288800	5290400	I expected you to say give me a flat up no.
5290640	5291441	I'm kind of surprised.
5293654	5298318	The thing is, what other applications on the homebrew site could use this camera and stuff?
5299318	5300499	I'd be more interested to see that.
5300519	5301560	You just want to hack it.
5301861	5302041	Yes.
5302701	5303642	DarkSakura, what do you think?
5304463	5305764	I wouldn't waste my money on it.
5305804	5307645	I already have 50 million other things that do all that.
5308606	5309347	I've got an iPhone.
5309367	5312149	I don't need anything else that takes pictures or plays music.
5313831	5315352	Tiara, any thoughts for you on this?
5317008	5320271	Well, like I said on Twitter, if it's not broke, don't fix it.
5320471	5323553	I already have a DS that works, so there's no reason for me to buy another one.
5324534	5328217	Speaking of Twitter, let's go over there and look at the answers to tonight's pre-show question.
5328497	5335103	We do have a Twitter account at OLR, simply our Twitter name, and sometimes we ask some questions before the show and read some of our favorite answers on the air.
5335143	5340467	We asked, would you buy the Nintendo DS again if they re-release it with a camera and music playback abilities?
5341328	5344891	We got a lot of replies tonight, so I'm going to try to read from people we don't usually hear from.
5345792	5347213	in the chat room or on Skype.
5347833	5353057	JohnnyG44 says, no, because almost everyone has a phone that can do both of those things.
5353378	5355900	I would buy a new DS with onboard memory storage, though.
5356480	5360523	Crows says, I have a cell phone with two megapixels and an iPod with 30 gigabytes.
5360884	5361844	I don't need those features.
5362165	5363406	It would just make it cost like 300 bucks.
5366735	5372119	Frisbee says, no, most people have an MP3 player, a digital camera, a camera MP3 phone, and a DS already.
5372439	5374881	Why pay for all three of these all over again?
5375582	5382707	DarkCircuitry says, I don't have a DS in the first place, but I'd happily buy one if it had those extra features, albeit at a lower price than it is now.
5383728	5385910	Decipher13 says, I'm still packing a fat...
5386744	5402343	A fat, a DS fat I've held off on getting a light so far But I do collect Nintendo handhelds I may eventually I collect Nintendo handhelds Can you imagine though if they did have storage Like say a gig of storage space on there How bad that would make the Wii look
5402978	5406021	GBA Multiplayer Compatibility Back, but the camera would be flippin' awesome.
5427620	5429562	So kind of a wide variety of answers on our Twitter.
5429582	5432725	I didn't even read them all, but it's very varied in the yeses and nos there.
5433065	5434807	Thanks to everybody that replied on Twitter.
5434847	5437890	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but I tried to focus on those that usually don't join us in chat.
5439031	5440913	Very interesting, the diverse amount of responses.
5441113	5444336	I think there were enough yeses, though, that this is going to be successful if they release it.
5444356	5447899	Well, they're not really having trouble selling DSs right now, I think.
5448480	5449541	And they're not really...
5450802	5454107	I don't think the PSP is getting close to them anytime soon.
5454548	5457572	I think this is obviously competing against Apple.
5457792	5466225	I mean, because now that they're becoming the gaming portable system, I mean, that's hard to swallow, but you know.
5467620	5469302	Maybe this is the compete with them.
5469983	5470704	Because it's cheaper.
5471445	5471986	Possibly.
5472026	5476611	This seems kind of a long ways afterwards to compete with PSP.
5477032	5483100	And now that we have camera functionality, I mean, how long will it be before we get gimmicky shit to go along with that?
5483140	5484702	I mean, I don't know.
5486304	5486484	Well...
5486832	5496397	All right, well, you know, if they hadn't moved enough copies of the DS Lite, maybe doing some charitable work would convince more people to get a DS, and that is just what is happening.
5497918	5502700	Amazon has actually released a new version of the Nintendo DS, apparently, on their site.
5503040	5516207	It's what's called the Polar White Console, but one special difference between this and a normal DS is that it actually has the pink breast cancer awareness ribbon, kind of like a universal logo, if you will, right there on the DS itself.
5516887	5533191	It's going to be $129.99, which is what any other DS would cost, but Nintendo is donating $5 from every purchase of one of these Nintendo DSs to a cancer research charity, a very commonly heard one in breast cancer awareness circles, Susan G. Komen for the cure.
5533551	5535832	The minimum donation promised is $100,000.
5536672	5539633	So there you go, if you want to do a little bit of charity.
5540322	5541162	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5563747	5569111	I don't see myself going out and buying another DS just for this when I could donate $20 myself.
5569512	5570012	You know what I mean?
5570873	5572053	I don't know.
5572914	5577257	I'm going to ask a question I think is out there, but some people might be too afraid to ask.
5577918	5579779	I'm going to put it out there.
5579939	5583102	Is this another way that Nintendo is trying to get women?
5585020	5593005	I mean, I hate to say it's a marketing ploy, but in a way, look at what they've been advertising lately.
5593085	5594866	Carrie Underwood, Pink DSes.
5595986	5599808	Is this a way for them to try and attract women to the Nintendo DS?
5600389	5609274	I would totally date Nintendo DS if he got a better job and could prove that he's into being committed to our relationship.
5611642	5614444	What does him adoring a pink ribbon do for you?
5614664	5616065	Does it make him that much sexier?
5618707	5619427	Not really.
5619928	5628093	If I wanted to donate $5 towards breast cancer, I could just donate $5 instead of going out and buying a whole new DS.
5628253	5635638	Or I could donate however much I want and get that as a tax write-off, where it doesn't work that way if you buy the pink DS and let Nintendo give them $5.
5635838	5635918	Yeah.
5637299	5651061	Well, on top of that, with all of these, you know, for example, the runs, the marketing going in behind this, that's money they're spending on marketing and organizing events that actually just could go to the research.
5651962	5661623	Especially for, you know, as poorly coordinated as a lot of the research is right now, they should put, you know, the money into... We're all aware.
5662143	5663304	The awareness is there.
5663964	5665624	You know, I think that the money is better...
5666505	5671831	And you can go on the- Apply towards the event, you know, towards not the awareness of, but the treatment thereof.
5672272	5675435	And if you don't know how to donate, I mean, you can go to their website online.
5675536	5680201	It's so simple and pretty much, I mean, there's links to tell you how to donate right there.
5680221	5683285	I mean- Komen.org, K-O-M-E-N.org.
5683906	5684306	Exactly.
5684326	5684767	There you go.
5686775	5691779	I'm sorry, but this is, it does seem kind of like a cheap attempt to get women to play their damn console.
5692079	5696563	I mean, I hate to say it, but you know a lot of people are thinking it.
5696623	5701287	If you really want to make an impact to breast cancer and you don't really care about this console, donate $129.99 to breast cancer then.
5701307	5701707	There you go.
5705558	5712384	Well, I think there's a happy medium somewhere, but it's just... Or charge a little more money for it.
5712404	5713986	They do that with postage stamps, right?
5714126	5717569	They charge a little more money for it, but it's that extra money that goes towards the research.
5717589	5718370	It's kind of like a donation.
5718450	5718750	I don't know.
5719471	5722554	It's just so that they can come out later on and go, look, we donated $100,000 to breast cancer.
5722574	5722874	We're so...
5726175	5727177	We're so helpful.
5727538	5728861	It's all for PR.
5728901	5730044	It's all to make them look good.
5730525	5736738	Giovedea in our chatroom says, Sorry, but as a girl, I'd probably break a pink DS with a hammer because it would be fun.
5738188	5748031	So sometimes, you know, you don't always get all the women with the pink and all that, but my question would be, but what do you think of the white DS with the pink ribbon?
5748831	5765155	What about, you know, because they always talk about breast cancer and stuff, and they have really good campaigns for breast cancer and cervical cancer and that kind of stuff, but heart disease, just lung cancer, you know, diabetes, stuff like that, you know, that kills a lot more people than breast cancer, so...
5766001	5768022	How about donating to that instead, too?
5769143	5769443	All right.
5769503	5772204	There's no ribbon for that, unfortunately, so, you know.
5772304	5775205	Certainly some controversial opinions in the community.
5775466	5776486	We look forward to hearing yours.
5776546	5777907	Mailbag at orange.radio.com.
5777947	5779327	Jamie will read them all live on air.
5779908	5781809	All right.
5781829	5783709	Just like she'll read the next story.
5786117	5795966	The next story is Orange Lounge Radio host Rob Roberts ended up being found in the garbage, chopped to tiny bits, with a I told you so from co-host.
5796186	5796847	That's sad.
5797968	5798769	Yeah, only to you.
5799249	5805655	Anyway, for our wee friends, who are wee little friends...
5806355	5817287	Who are not only virtual console users, but love NEC and Hudson and all the things associated with the PC Engine slash TurboGrafx.
5817748	5819730	We are getting SuperGrafx games!
5820291	5823674	And I have to apologize to Bobby for what I...
5824575	5826356	A little bit of incorrectness on my comment.
5826377	5845971	The Super Graphics actually was the successor to the PC Engine, especially the PC Engine Duo with the arcade card units, as 100% backwards compatible and had new Super Hue card games that you could play.
5848292	5860657	and also these other peripherals that never ended up coming out for it, including a fully functional, well, a full representation of a flight joystick like they've got for, you know, the flight simulators on PC now.
5861177	5865358	But at any rate, Super Graphics games are going to be coming to Virtual Console.
5865939	5871401	The first of them being Dai Makai Mura, which was Ghouls and Ghosts.
5872761	5883749	and honestly I've seen the Super Graphics version of it and it's one of the best ever as far as any type of home system port so I am personally very excited about that.
5884149	5892875	Nintendo hasn't announced a US release but there are NEC console and ports on the shop channel so hey.
5894035	5894835	Maybe we'll be getting it.
5895275	5896156	That'll be pretty cool.
5896816	5905577	But on top of that, other games that we could be looking forward to that came out on Super Graphics in Japan was 1941 Counter-Attack.
5907998	5923141	Well, really, I think that's about all the ones that we're going to know for sure, except for there was a rumor that Strider was, there was a prototype for it, so we could be getting a really good version of Strider if they decided to do a release on that, although the last PC Engine release of that was a
5923781	5927085	The Arcade Card Version for PC Engine Duo.
5930008	5930829	I'm really excited.
5931530	5935094	The Super Graphics... The games were expensive, dude.
5935114	5939538	They were like $110 a piece for HuCards.
5940119	5944584	It could have done better if it wasn't so expensive.
5947305	5949008	How many of these are actually out there?
5949369	5950030	Not a lot, right?
5950130	5952434	There were seven created.
5953776	5954897	Two were unreleased.
5956079	5958102	One of them... No, I'm not talking about the games.
5958122	5959344	I'm talking about the systems itself.
5959605	5960246	Oh, the systems.
5960266	5961528	Yeah, there's not a lot of them out there, right?
5963359	5964180	Super Potato, Akihabara, Duo LT
5987011	5991015	I'm looking right now on eBay, just curious what people would charge for these.
5991035	5994237	And I see one NEC Super Graphic System with Battle Ace.
5994398	5996419	New, very rare.
5996720	5998541	$89.99, which isn't bad, but there's six days left on it.
5998601	6000163	So who knows what that's going to look like.
6000303	6005087	I can see that auction going to about $200, $250, like what this one was.
6005507	6008030	But then again, you can also buy a...
6009771	6011213	I'll find out how many of them they produced
6025407	6038275	All right, well, anyhow, regardless, you know, it's going to bring a whole, you know, even though I guess not a whole lot of new games, but certainly something that probably a lot of people never have experienced before to the market via virtual console.
6038295	6039556	So that's neat, I suppose.
6040917	6042718	I bet you'll be checking out some of these games, DarkSakura.
6044068	6052271	I'm definitely interested in getting Daimakai Mora, although, honestly, I have the Saturn release, which was the arcade version.
6053471	6062214	But it'd be cool, I mean, to have it on, especially getting that over Super Ghouls N' Ghosts, because, honestly, that game was kind of crap for being in that series.
6063115	6068176	What was the... Cho Makai Mora was the name for that one, even going by the original name.
6069237	6069317	Um...
6071618	6077561	But I'm checking it out and I don't see exactly how many were made.
6078341	6080382	Well, they should just release all the games at once.
6080482	6082063	Just have a big Super Graphics week.
6083023	6084384	Although I somehow doubt that'll happen.
6085299	6092662	But it actually seems pretty cool, though, that it used two independently scrolling background layers as far as its graphics.
6092722	6107267	I put sort of like how the Genesis did, which, you know, was like one of the... In fact, they had a problem with some of the releases of the games for one system versus the other because of if it was a single or dual layer for the app, it had used two video chips.
6107587	6109808	It was a pretty advanced system for its time.
6109868	6112589	It just was pretty darn expensive.
6112609	6112889	Yeah.
6114147	6118090	FaceDistantChat asks, wait, five games were released for the console.
6118130	6120031	How long a life could that have on virtual console?
6120371	6132798	Well, I don't know if it's necessarily about trying to milk the life of the system, but let's face it, Nintendo or the companies behind it share in the profits of however much they're going to charge for each one of these games.
6132818	6135460	Let's say $7 for each sale.
6135500	6139562	That's $7 they weren't going to get before, especially for a lot of people who have never played.
6139702	6140402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6155251	6155591	All right.
6176189	6176349	Pippin
6195885	6196605	I don't know about that, but...
6216738	6219439	A plethora of other awesome animated films.
6219799	6222380	We'll be doing the animation for that title as well.
6224141	6228343	To make the game unique, it will come with a Magic Master Book.
6228923	6234185	I guess that will be shared by the main character of the game, which needs to be referred to while playing the game.
6237527	6239968	Also, they will be making a console version at some point.
6241038	6241739	So that's kind of cool.
6243220	6247563	Nice to see some pretty solid animated games coming to the DS.
6248344	6250726	Have we had a new Studio Ghibli movie in a while?
6251366	6251927	We haven't seen one.
6251947	6255109	I thought there was a new one coming.
6255129	6257691	I thought there was one that was coming out this year or something.
6257712	6258592	I just haven't heard much of it.
6258612	6260334	Maybe it already came out in Japan and it's not out here yet.
6260894	6270562	I haven't, ever since I got out of the movie department, and, you know, I haven't really been paying attention to what new movies are coming out from that studio, so, uh, yeah.
6270802	6273244	But all of them are gold, I mean, seriously.
6273524	6274865	Yeah, they're good movies.
6275185	6280610	So I'm very curious to see what kind of game comes out of this, because it could either be really good or just one of those things that looks good on paper.
6282074	6284136	Level 5 is not stopping there with that partnership.
6284176	6287718	They are also going to be making some new games for the PSP.
6288558	6291420	They don't really have anything to do with the Studio Ghibli project.
6291721	6294963	However, they are doing some other games on the PSP.
6295103	6297204	One of them is called Ushiro.
6298045	6301287	It's kind of a scary RPG, if you want to say, for the PSP.
6302027	6305250	You will actually kind of play as a Shingami.
6305310	6307751	It's a god of death in Japanese lore.
6308412	6311574	And you will fight monsters and also grant people's wishes.
6312114	6315235	Dambol Senki Cardboard War Machine RPG Projects for the PSP coming from level 5
6336363	6337204	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6359246	6360848	No more ports on the PSP!
6362749	6364870	Well, they actually kind of port it in reverse a lot of times.
6364890	6366451	They port PSP games to PS2.
6366872	6368032	Well, I kind of thought that was interesting.
6368072	6369894	They don't want ports on the PSP.
6371595	6373696	But I'm thinking, well, they've still got some big sellers.
6373736	6376738	Like Puzzle Quest would be a port that's a big sell, right?
6376899	6377879	Why would you want to say no to that?
6377899	6381442	Well, I think they were looking for games that are developed specifically for the PSP.
6381962	6385905	Because a lot of the games that come out, the PSP version isn't exactly that strong.
6386445	6400735	and so it's making the console look kind of weak but I think they need I don't know it's like a double edged sword there they need more units to be sold so more publishers get interested in it but they need more publishers interested in it so they can get more units sold
6401656	6404439	Before DarkSakura gets to the next story, I got the answer to the question I was looking for.
6404459	6410664	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea just came out from Studio Ghibli.
6411105	6414187	And I thought I heard something about that that was the name of the new movie.
6414387	6416529	But correct me if I'm wrong, it's only out in Japan, right?
6416549	6420253	It hasn't come out here because Disney has to do their thing with the translation and all that.
6420573	6423876	We probably won't see it until early next year, probably.
6426038	6427459	All right, we can move on with gaming news.
6428099	6428759	Right, DarkSakura?
6429279	6429960	That we can.
6430360	6434342	Well, there is some news for City of Heroes.
6434402	6436543	I know that there are plenty of people who still play that.
6438223	6443385	That the mission editor is actually going to be delayed.
6443586	6447707	So now issue 13 is to be retitled Power and Responsibility.
6447727	6448688	Okay.
6450048	6459632	Everything else was supposed to come out with the architect mode and an extension for the sidekick buddy system that's a leveling pact.
6460412	6466414	Basically it lets you and your friends synchronize your experience so that you're always at the same level.
6468535	6470195	Even if one person plays more than the other.
6470556	6474237	So you can play together more on an even keel.
6474457	6475058	That's kind of cool.
6475878	6480562	Also, there's multi-builds, so you can keep two different versions of the same character.
6481723	6487027	There's also day jobs, power sets, and merit rewards will be included as well.
6487067	6490530	And they say that the architect, mission, editor will be coming out later.
6491191	6499177	But also, part of the thing in it is supposed to let you create your own NPCs for those missions.
6499618	6500238	So that's pretty cool.
6501259	6501720	Very cool.
6503141	6503321	Well,
6503826	6504527	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6521926	6529754	But yes, Punisher will be getting not only a new movie this year, but a new game thanks to the PlayStation Network.
6530415	6540846	Punisher No Mercy is exclusive to the PlayStation Network and will be coming to us from Zen Studios, who unfortunately don't have much of a...
6542521	6550746	Uh, resume, but, uh, Rocky and Bullwinkle, the Xbox Live Arcade game, and the new Mushroom Man game, which look kind of, eh, alright.
6550926	6551567	But who knows?
6551627	6553488	Maybe this is the, uh, Diamond in the Rough.
6554048	6562733	Um, it will be powered by the Unreal 3 engine, and of course we'll follow, uh, you know, Frank Castle as he seeks revenge.
6563314	6566716	And, um, they've got some screenshots out for the game so far.
6566756	6567776	It actually looks pretty good.
6568457	6570058	Um, no word on how it's gonna play.
6570818	6571118	But, um...
6572557	6578038	Apparently also, I guess, I don't know.
6578558	6580739	It's no word on when exactly it's going to be released.
6580779	6582759	I would imagine maybe around the time of the film.
6584259	6585700	Oh, that's what it says.
6586060	6589441	Aiming to release the game in line with the new Punisher film.
6590281	6596062	And it will include both single and multiplayer modes as well, character customizations and trophies.
6598678	6600299	Why did everyone hate Rocky and Bullwinkle?
6624338	6629961	I don't know, the fun factor was kind of missing from that game, especially for something so nostalgic.
6630281	6632262	The game just kind of felt cheap to me.
6634062	6638484	It's really hard to put my finger on it, but it just kind of felt like it wasn't any fun.
6638964	6645207	The minigames were kind of like they might make you smile for a second, but then you're like, I can't see myself playing this again.
6645227	6646568	It would have been a better game on the Wii.
6647228	6647589	You think?
6648249	6649291	With the motion control and everything?
6649451	6649791	Maybe.
6650332	6656479	I mean, it's just the Wii seems to be the party game machine, but at the same time it's getting overkill with that stuff.
6656499	6658702	That genre is way too much on there.
6659162	6667132	It's like if you want to call the Xbox 360 a first person shooter console, then the Wii is definitely the party game console.
6669281	6670563	All right, moving on.
6670763	6675068	And this is going to, you know, our longtime fans, you know, because I think we mentioned this quite often.
6675128	6677431	We had started originally way back on episode one.
6677471	6685622	It's a show really revolving around music-based video games, and especially DDR was a big focus of this game, of that era of Orange Launch Radio.
6686222	6696709	I'm sure a lot of our listeners who remember that still follow what goes on in the DDR world are going to find this news very interesting because it isn't about DDR, but a possible new competitor to DDR.
6697149	6702212	Not a lot is known about it, but we do know that a patent has been filed with the official U.S.
6702272	6707635	Patent and Trademark Office by Activision for a game called Dance Hero.
6708700	6711402	Guitar Hero, Dance Hero, Video Game Controllers
6738792	6740613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6755262	6774857	and rebuild the game from the ground up and in a way I think that's exactly what's going to happen here with what Activision is doing is that they're going to take a dance game concept and rebuild it from the ground up so that could be very interesting and I'm not ready to scream theft just yet because I have a feeling this could be something kind of new and innovative
6776254	6776714	You know what I mean?
6777034	6777335	I don't know.
6777355	6777855	What do you guys think?
6778235	6779135	New and innovative.
6779756	6787199	From a company who ripped off Guitar Freak's Drum Mania and beat Mania.
6787580	6788220	Might make it better.
6788340	6789020	Might make it better.
6789160	6790821	To be honest, I don't think they're really going to change it.
6790921	6799766	It's probably going to look like a guitar hero type of game, but instead of maybe notes scrolling down the screen, it's going to be arrows or steps or feet or something.
6799786	6800266	I don't know.
6800686	6801386	To that effect.
6801947	6802167	But...
6805146	6806468	I know, I hear you.
6806488	6808991	They're whoring the brand to death, seriously.
6809311	6810092	Right, right.
6810292	6816960	And I see all those concerns, but at the same time, I kind of feel like, oh, somebody might be finally reinventing the approach to the dance game.
6816980	6820784	Because let's face it, every other dance game that's come out in the groove...
6821765	6824546	Uh, the, the, what am I thinking of?
6824586	6829488	The freaking game that you can use your own CDs on that was terrible on the PS2?
6829988	6830668	What the hell was that game?
6830688	6831409	Dance Factory.
6832229	6833809	Factory or whatever, yeah, Dance Factory or whatever.
6834070	6836130	They've all pretty much been the same damn thing.
6836190	6837711	It's four arrows that you stomp to.
6838703	6840885	Well, maybe this could be something different.
6856397	6858819	DJ Hero sounds like guitar hero, but exchange the guitar for a DJ turntable.
6858839	6862002	I mean, seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if you could use the DJ turntable in your game.
6877817	6880738	and Guitar Hero because it probably is just another controller.
6881159	6886081	Instead of the strum bar, it's scratching and instead of the fret buttons, it's keys.
6886481	6887381	Oh my god!
6887602	6890043	So much innovation, it blows my mind!
6891263	6894385	Will I be able to get Star Power 2 by shaking the turntable?
6894585	6897046	Oh, maybe I'll have a crossfader for that, you know?
6897986	6898527	God!
6899567	6900087	I'm sorry.
6900568	6901208	I'm not interested.
6901228	6902348	I'll bet you, you know what?
6902368	6902729	You know why?
6906988	6914574	Because they have Guitar Hero behind them, and they have these games behind them, they're going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted for DDR.
6914874	6917596	And they're not going to have to fill up a song list with originals.
6917716	6924801	Granted, we as DDR fans have come to know and love those Konami originals, but it's part of the reason why the game didn't sell as well over here.
6924821	6927363	They're having to rely on a lot of Japan-centric songs.
6927724	6931106	They're going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted in DDR.
6931446	6931967	And they know it.
6932367	6933229	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6940626	6942126	Speculation Speculation
6969167	6969407	It is.
6969627	6970608	It's all speculation.
6971048	6971829	Track record.
6971909	6973150	They hoard this thing.
6973810	6976692	I swear to God, they hoard this thing so bad.
6976912	6984277	You watch next year when Guitar Hero has four to six game releases and people are going, my God.
6984697	6990441	I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero... Five cents.
6990461	6990941	No, more than that.
6991041	6996244	I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero will sell more copies than Beat Mania did here in this country.
6996425	6998366	Yeah, I can guarantee that will happen.
6998866	7004310	and I don't know if I can make the same thing for Dance Hero because, you know, it has done very, very well.
7004350	7006011	But DJ Hero will sell by its name alone.
7006251	7009333	It could be the worst game ever, but people go, oh my god, I want to be a DJ.
7009393	7010974	But what if it's not bad?
7011695	7013876	I'm not saying DJ Hero will be bad.
7014116	7015737	I'm saying Dance Hero will be bad.
7015778	7016558	What if it's not?
7016918	7017899	It's gonna suck.
7018159	7019120	It's gonna suck.
7019260	7019620	Alright.
7019720	7020220	Big time.
7021301	7027404	If it sells more than... Okay, how many copies of Guitar Hero, the first Guitar Hero sold?
7027704	7028845	Oh, I don't know.
7029185	7031586	During its first month of release.
7032646	7033807	Not enough until it went on 360.
7034127	7035988	I don't think.
7036408	7039650	Well, plus they had to get the first game out there to license the songs everybody wanted to play.
7039710	7047053	It doesn't matter anyways, because this game will never... So, say that it sells more in its first month than Guitar Hero did...
7050260	7053342	Dance Hero will not sell more than Guitar Hero did in its first month.
7053382	7057044	Do you bet you're... Oh, oh, oh, no, I disagree, sir.
7057185	7058866	I think there's a bet forming here.
7059026	7060727	No, there is not a bet forming here.
7060807	7063849	The only bet is the Eye of Judgment, okay?
7064049	7065550	This is just a registered trademark.
7065570	7067171	We don't know what this is at all.
7067431	7071814	So why are you thinking that it's going to... Because I saw the Eye of Judgment.
7071854	7073755	I'm like, wow, that is a piece of shit.
7073815	7075296	But you haven't seen Dance Hero.
7075316	7076657	What is the point of this game?
7076957	7077477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7099008	7105015	Yeah, we can go ahead and take the devil's advocate thing, but the fact of the matter is they need a peripheral with every one of these fucking hero games.
7105395	7108118	So what is the magic peripheral that's going to come along with this?
7108238	7111381	And really, is it going to innovate anything other than having a better song list?
7114878	7115498	Thanks for watching!
7135114	7135895	You know what, though?
7136615	7137376	Everything's a matter of time.
7137416	7138597	Track record is two words.
7138817	7140078	Speculation is one word.
7140178	7141500	You were supposed to sum it up in one word.
7141540	7144702	Therefore, you are disqualified and your opinion is thrown out.
7145343	7146644	I make my own damn rules.
7147805	7150628	That's okay because we're entitled to make our own rules and change them at will.
7153290	7153831	You lose.
7154311	7159015	A man will never win an argument with a woman because we're awesome and men aren't.
7159195	7159415	Sorry.
7159435	7159776	Wow.
7159816	7160396	You should know that.
7160416	7161017	You're married.
7161037	7161617	Yeah.
7161657	7162098	Yeah.
7165194	7168376	Nelly, if you're listening, come up here and lay down the law.
7169156	7169516	All right.
7170797	7171097	Wow.
7171157	7172098	All right.
7172118	7172538	You know what?
7173018	7173398	You know what?
7173498	7174799	Lots of good, you know what?
7175259	7179281	Whether you agree with Loki or not, you know, lots of good points being brought up around the board.
7179341	7181422	And I'm sure we're going to have some calls on it later as well.
7181782	7188426	I mean, no offense to Dan's here, but I think the logical step for them would be to do like a keyboard hero because that's at least something you can add.
7188446	7189566	Because we haven't had keyboard mania.
7189706	7190667	Exactly.
7191247	7192888	Well, we haven't had DDR either.
7193028	7196551	Seriously, fuck Konami with a big chainsaw for disbanding that series.
7196591	7197812	I know, Keyboard Mania was fantastic.
7197852	7200334	Because Keyboard Mania I was actually pretty good at.
7200354	7202775	Who is in charge of the DDR series now?
7202815	7204497	Is it like on autopilot or something?
7204537	7206358	Because, I mean, what is seriously happening?
7207519	7219868	I really do think they should bring a keyboard thing out because in that way you can add it to Guitar Hero World Tour You can have keyboards with a lot of stuff Who doesn't want to play Van Halen's Jump?
7219888	7228214	We need sax maniacs This is going to lead to Bagpipe Hero and Didgeridoo Hero Sitar Hero Let's move on
7230697	7232818	DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and reads a few of her favorites.
7257570	7258655	After she drinks some soda.
7259278	7260202	Well, the music's playing.
7260222	7260805	What are we going to do?
7260846	7261569	Just sit here and wait?
7262182	7264624	Well, we can stare at the ants.
7264864	7265844	Is there more ants now?
7265884	7268126	Yeah, but they're attacking something on the floor and I don't really know what.
7268186	7269907	I saw like a trail of them.
7269927	7270608	They're running over there.
7270748	7271848	I'm off to get the raid.
7271949	7273870	Oh, I can't because I don't smell like raid in here.
7273930	7274490	God damn it.
7274530	7276452	How about a fire?
7276472	7277512	Email time.
7277572	7279914	Let's set fire to the floor and burn all the ants.
7279934	7284457	Did you ever watch that YouTube video of the guy burning the hornet's nest on his child's swing set?
7284537	7285257	Oh my gosh.
7285398	7288199	Setting it on fire with as many different flammable things as he could find.
7288700	7289941	I was like, stupid.
7290121	7291862	I think I'll be looking that up right now.
7292983	7293324	Okay.
7293424	7294505	Setting fire to swing set.
7294525	7296508	Look up fucking moron and you'll find him.
7296888	7298530	Well, that could be a ton of videos on there.
7298550	7299732	I gotta look fire swing set.
7300132	7300433	Okay.
7300853	7303276	I think it's fire and hornets, but anyway.
7303316	7307181	First email comes from Hunter Red, aka Redertainment.
7307902	7308523	Hey, y'all.
7310205	7312686	You know, I can't say y'all without saying it in accent.
7313106	7313506	Y'all.
7314407	7321470	As you know, the season where the masses choose which douchebag will represent them is upon us and I have a question to that end.
7322330	7333235	I'm going to send an email to all the douchebags running for Congress in my district and I want to ask them how they feel about video games and the legislation that is currently pending about them.
7333835	7338437	Is there a way I should phrase my email so that I can get a response from them other than not calling them douchebags?
7338537	7339498	That's gonna smell, man.
7342102	7342703	I would have done it.
7344264	7344924	But it'll smell.
7345965	7349428	I know that because I would have done it.
7350228	7356033	By the way, Sky, that means you, Mr. I've-left-the-studio-try-to-set-fire-to-the-ant.
7356073	7356913	Sorry, I was getting fire.
7358435	7363378	By the way, Sky, if you hate the influence of the Mormon church and politics in California, you should come to Utah.
7363619	7365220	They're everywhere and are everything.
7366522	7379487	No, I've heard about Utah, and it's, you know, it's just, you know, you guys, if you listened to the show last week, you already know how I feel about Proposition 8 and how it's, you know, setting civil rights back about 50 years, but, you know, what can you do?
7379867	7384749	Honestly, if you want to see the influence of the Mormon church, just go talk to a, you know, Boy Scout troop.
7387210	7392433	Thanks, love the show, you do what I ask for any podcasts I listen to, work to do, inform, entertain, and make me laugh.
7392833	7394894	Thanks again, Hunter Red, a.k.a.
7394954	7395674	Redertainment.
7396291	7396831	You're welcome.
7398292	7398692	Next one?
7399732	7399932	Yes.
7400553	7401273	Hey, guys.
7402333	7405995	Dan Shadow here with your helpful hints for Warhammer Online.
7406435	7410437	There are thousands of tome unlocks and hundreds of titles you can earn.
7410777	7413818	I'm going to help you get some of the nicer title unlocks.
7414338	7415579	First, take off all your clothes.
7417125	7420247	Second, use 100 abilities to be known as the show-off.
7421147	7424429	Third, talk to 100 citizens while naked to be a flirt.
7425229	7428531	If you target another naked player 100 times, you'll become the ogler.
7429371	7433533	If you want to get a nice title that doesn't involve nudity, then jump off a cliff and die.
7434174	7437716	If you do this 25 times, you can have the word AHHHHH floating above your head.
7439076	7440657	That's all the helpful hints for this week.
7441017	7445460	I just got into the LittleBigPlanet beta, so I'll let you guys know how that one goes when I can.
7445560	7445920	See ya!
7447219	7449702	I want to be in the little big planet beta so that I don't even have a PS3.
7449962	7452245	I just want a key to say I'm in it and you're not.
7452405	7455368	I want to be in a game and have, ah, floating over my head.
7455849	7457971	Or remember there was Impossible Mission.
7458292	7460454	You've been listening to Orange Lounge.
7460574	7461535	No, OLR's not over.
7461615	7461896	Sorry.
7463778	7464659	And the show's canceled.
7464699	7465299	Good night, everyone.
7466561	7467302	Next email.
7468604	7474668	My question for OLR this week is, do you guys have a backlog of video games to play slash finish and how large is the backlog?
7474748	7476309	Oh shit, you really want me to answer that?
7476850	7481733	Personally, I have a backlog on PS2 and even on the Xbox 360, which I only purchased a couple months ago.
7482133	7484575	The majority are some RPGs and some action games.
7484895	7490699	I feel that DDR and World of Warcraft sometimes eat up a lot of my free time, but I'm not sure what stops me from finishing some games.
7491179	7495702	As promised, Triple A to an old school DDR song, Burn in the Floor, in honor of OLR and 300th show.
7498243	7499564	He actually sent a picture of it too.
7500064	7502985	This email is brought to you by DarkSakura School of Dancing Ferrets.
7503045	7504765	Peace out and AAA Jammer Jones.
7505926	7510387	Off the top of my head, Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, Final Fantasy XII.
7511227	7513168	They're all games I need to... Kingdom Hearts 2.
7513248	7514248	Shit, I never finished that one.
7514268	7515568	I got really far but I didn't finish it.
7515969	7517009	There's tons of games I need to finish.
7517089	7518089	I have a gaming ADD.
7518129	7519630	I've said it a million times on this show.
7520550	7521730	Especially this time of year.
7521750	7522790	That's a huge ass freaking picture.
7522871	7523831	How can you play...
7524711	7526193	Just one game this time of year.
7526394	7530619	It seems like every week leading up to Christmas, there's a new freaking game coming out that I have to play.
7530880	7535025	Like Fable 2 is coming out soon, and I barely have touched Warhammer, Spore even.
7535346	7537829	I think I've sunk maybe five hours into Spore, tops.
7538150	7539632	And already there's new games coming out I want.
7540385	7541226	Thanks for watching!
7556480	7575366	and a perfect score I'll tell you the big one here's the big one Strong Bad, the episodic Strong Bad's games I freaking know people that have worked on those games and I keep saying I'm going to support them and I want to play the games I haven't even touched them yet just because there's been so much else that have been grabbing my attention but I really do want to play the Strong Bad games at some point
7575686	7578987	My present backlog is I actually do want to go back and finish Kingdom Hearts 2.
7579707	7590090	And I actually never finished Final Fantasy X because I got so pissed off that I had rushed through leveling the game that I got to one of the battles with What's-His-Stupid-Face with his ugly blue hair.
7591050	7595612	And I got to the Glyph Mine battle past that and none of my characters were high enough to stand one hit.
7596232	7597092	So that's my own bad.
7597952	7598313	And I...
7601147	7604751	I still have to finish Kingdom Hearts 2, but I glitched the game in a major way.
7605692	7605892	Nice.
7606333	7610438	I skipped some level, and now I can't get into doing the Pride Lands.
7611058	7612019	So it's pretty stupid.
7613441	7615583	I think I did Halloween Town twice in a row or something.
7616144	7616284	But...
7617325	7617766	Next email.
7617886	7618126	Next email.
7640305	7657720	I was just wondering and I just started listening to the podcast so I'm not certain if you guys have talked about this what you guys thought about the makers of Psychonauts making a sequel seeing as how I think it was rated as 14th greatest Xbox even though it wasn't a great seller to my knowledge Xbox Live Gamer Tag Quick Sticks
7659289	7660209	Excellent question.
7661810	7663411	That's another one of those games I didn't play a lot of.
7663431	7666952	I have played Psychonauts, just not a lot in depth.
7667652	7669333	I don't see how it's a bad thing, though.
7669553	7675035	Psychonauts had a lot of fans, and a lot of people have been slowly discovering that game over the years.
7675535	7677776	It's kind of like a cult game, like a cult movie.
7678236	7681197	Not a lot of people see it when it first comes out, but it sells really well on DVD.
7681897	7683158	People want to go back and check it out later.
7683178	7683878	That's kind of what Psychonauts is.
7683898	7688760	It's one of those games that people get together and sacrifice virgins on altars in the basement of their building.
7688840	7689580	and Drink the Kool-Aid.
7689640	7690561	No, it's not that kind of game.
7691081	7698264	But I didn't play enough of the first one to really say, oh, I'm excited about a sequel.
7698644	7704266	But I know that the first game was unique enough with a cool sense of humor about it that I think a second game will be welcome.
7704306	7706467	And I bet you more people check out the sequel than the first one.
7707047	7712850	And making a sequel, honestly, will get more people to check out the original, which is available as an Xbox Live original, if I'm not mistaken.
7715278	7737429	One of our listeners, I guess, I'm not ever quite sure how to pronounce it, but I think it's Nige, but anyway, one of our British listeners saw a story on the BBC News website and linked it to us, which is a Germany arrest over gamer death where a man is arrested in Germany on suspicion of the murder of a 20-year-old internet gamer in Nottingham.
7739470	7742312	Checking out the article as soon as it loads up.
7744921	7751548	and I'll link the article in the chat room since it's very nice to share that with us as soon as the damn thing loads.
7752609	7759336	Matthew Pike, 20, was found stabbed in his flat above the Orange Tree Pub on North Sherwood Street on Friday.
7759856	7764441	So the one arrested was a guy from Lindbergh and
7766282	7769403	So does that mean if you can't beat them, you should gank them?
7769423	7769543	Nice.
7796287	7797668	But thank you for sharing that with us.
7798389	7806416	Also, Cheeseburger, somebody go smack Cheeseburger around with the large trout in the chat room for me, because the email was dongle.
7808198	7808418	Nice.
7810711	7811412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7826781	7827662	Last email.
7828182	7830484	This comes from Isabel.
7830945	7834348	These are just some photos me and my friend took for Pyramid Head Day.
7834828	7839893	We made cupcakes with little Pyramid Head heads on top of them and I made a Pyramid Head costume.
7840213	7841354	Happy Pyramid Head Day.
7841414	7843055	Hope Silent Hill Homecoming is awesome.
7843436	7846799	But none of you get to see them because I haven't actually uploaded them anywhere.
7846819	7848360	They're on our email.
7849041	7852804	But they are funny and cute and Pyramid Head is tasty delicious.
7857657	7858317	Hooray for Peahitty Day.
7858357	7862900	Well, I'm really glad that people actually went and celebrated Pyramid Head Day.
7863260	7863881	That's wonderful.
7864101	7866322	I hope we get more pictures over the coming weeks.
7866602	7867523	It's Peahitty Day.
7867763	7868443	Peahitty Day.
7868943	7870204	Vote or Peahitty will kill you.
7871685	7872225	Seriously.
7872325	7874306	That's it for email.
7874447	7874667	All right.
7874707	7878649	If you want to send us an email next time, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
7879346	7879506	Bungie
7903723	7909068	The game developer believes that game companies should pocket money from used game sales.
7909948	7919436	And it seems, I guess, that they feel since the used sales, like for example, had a big impact on Halo.
7920096	7926642	And when you have a multi-million dollar seller game and I guess they're losing money on used copies of the game.
7927560	7928942	I think they're wrong though, because that's retarded.
7929022	7934868	If I buy something and I sell it to somebody else, why should you get a piece of that?
7949980	7958624	Yeah, like if I sell, you know, my refrigerator to someone else because I'm going to get a newer, fancier refrigerator, I don't have to send Maytag 20 bucks.
7958644	7959725	You know what I mean?
7959825	7965528	Yeah, it's basically like, you know, I saw like some comments or something, talkbacks about it.
7965648	7972191	It's like you own your money 100% and it's all bartering basically because you're trading your money.
7972771	7975253	for 100% ownership of said game.
7975833	7984579	So if they want a portion of when you sell that game, then you should get a portion of the money that they spend on, say, when they buy groceries.
7985699	7987440	CD industry's had to deal with this for years.
7987480	7988321	It hasn't killed them.
7988501	7990342	Piracy killed the CD industry.
7990623	7991123	Exactly.
7991803	7992624	I think, I mean...
7994125	8005329	Use game sales can be good because you say a consumer doesn't really want to buy your game at full price and say they buy Halo 1 and then they like it and then they go out and buy Halo 2 when it comes out.
8005789	8006649	So it's extra sales.
8006789	8010370	I don't see how this is a bad thing and besides, you already got paid.
8010930	8011330	Okay?
8012491	8019273	I mean, why are they even complaining about the fact that they don't sell as many units because they've already sold those units to retail stores.
8019653	8022194	The retail stores now have to sell them
8024007	8030911	And if they decide to sell used games over new games, like a lot of these game stores like GameStop, they push their used sales.
8030991	8034473	In fact, if they have a used copy, they'll be like, hey, do you want the used copy instead?
8036134	8038755	They push those first because they're making more money off of them anyway.
8038815	8039476	So what's it matter?
8039516	8041577	Because they've already paid you for the product.
8042594	8043615	You're not losing out on anything.
8043915	8045395	TheRobD has an interesting comment in chat.
8045455	8046376	Guess what, developers?
8046776	8047737	DLC exists.
8048037	8049057	Give us a reason to keep it.
8049437	8051198	Even better, make additional content free.
8051378	8051759	Exactly.
8051819	8052899	Give us a reason to keep your game.
8053079	8057281	Download content where it's at because that's a way you can make more money off of each game you sell.
8059903	8060163	I don't know.
8061183	8066926	Yeah, I definitely don't think that they should ever get to the point where they have to get a portion of you to sell.
8066946	8067927	That's just stupid.
8068803	8072526	All right, well, moving on to other people that want a piece of the pie.
8073507	8075589	Activision Blizzard has gone on the record.
8075649	8087400	The CEO, Bobby Kotick, has said basically a response to what the Warner Music executive, Edgar Bronfman, said previously.
8087881	8094126	And what he had said was that the royalty rates for songs that are used in Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and so on are paltry.
8094807	8095767	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8124341	8127462	Maybe people should be paying them to put their songs in the game.
8127702	8128883	It's like free advertising.
8131023	8132644	No, because the songs make the game.
8132764	8137666	And if you want to take that route and like, well, we're not going to put any songs in our game unless you pay us to do it.
8138346	8141747	Yeah, go right ahead and see what your song list looks like then.
8142107	8143168	Right, that's a very good point.
8143208	8145408	Without these songs, then the game is going to be nothing.
8145428	8152391	But at the same time, there's kind of a fine line here because I think if these guys get too greedy, especially if it's one company over the others...
8153011	8159454	Then they'll be able to still put out a perfectly solid game from music from other labels that are out there.
8159474	8163156	Well, just look at some other companies doing similar things.
8163717	8170180	GameStop, and I'm sure this is true for a lot of other retailers as well, they charge companies to put their games in the store.
8170640	8172201	They charge them for shelf space.
8172941	8180065	They actually, when they have signage in their store for a certain game, they make those companies pay for that signage to be in their store.
8180825	8181946	I mean, that's just ridiculous.
8182046	8183387	It's the same thing with this.
8183807	8188631	They're saying, oh, well, our game is immensely popular, and because of it, your music is becoming more popular.
8188711	8191814	Well, the reason people buy that game in the first place is because of your song list.
8192474	8195036	And if your song list sucks, then people won't buy your game.
8196057	8197698	And then you won't have your popularity.
8200100	8204604	In my mind, both sides stand to lose something if they can't agree on it.
8205224	8208267	And I would say then, I think it should stay the way it is.
8209246	8209947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8236027	8242191	Sonic M88 in chat says, over at chat.orange.com says, I discovered a lot of great songs in the Guitar Hero games.
8242291	8245733	I love playing the game despite the fact that I didn't know most of the songs.
8246313	8251457	So, you know, but there are music game fans that are going to play these games no matter what, even if they don't know a single song in them.
8251777	8259181	But I think certainly part of the reason why Guitar Hero really kind of broke out in some sense is because it was a lot of those songs you've always wanted to play on the guitar.
8259221	8259662	You know what I mean?
8260182	8262824	Plus, they did a really good job marketing their game.
8263544	8264185	I think as well.
8264265	8265907	They got it out there in the press.
8266307	8270912	You remember when that guy went over to Jamie's house and you guys got interviewed for the news?
8271452	8276738	That was probably because Red Octane put out a press release about the game and was able to call attention to it.
8277018	8279681	They were very good at getting themselves in the papers and everything.
8281257	8281997	Just kind of a thought.
8282098	8283138	It's also pretty fun.
8284259	8294765	I mean, on top of that, it just seemed to me like there was a much better appreciation to the gamers themselves that actually wanted to work with the community.
8295145	8295305	Right.
8295325	8297747	All right, well, let's move on with some more news.
8301112	8302192	Ghostbusters Game
8321599	8328006	So, you know, for all those rumors been floating around about another Ghostbusters movie, that might actually be a little bit more likely.
8328607	8329047	Maybe.
8330909	8331349	We hope.
8334453	8335594	As long as he's not too old for it.
8336280	8337041	Well, we'll see.
8337441	8345648	Maybe he's realizing that some of these other movies he's making aren't exactly as good as, you know, he hasn't exactly been on a big movie streak lately.
8346068	8346369	I don't know.
8346389	8350212	I just couldn't see that Ghostbusters 3 would actually be that big of a movie if they did one.
8350292	8350832	You know what I mean?
8351012	8353655	Maybe a lot of it depends on star power and who they get in the movie.
8354055	8359079	But if they don't have the right people in the movie, I don't know if there'd really be that much interest in a Ghostbusters 3.
8359119	8359840	You know what I mean?
8361092	8363655	TigerClaw says there is a third Ghostbusters movie in the works.
8363715	8365276	It's being written by the writers of The Office.
8365557	8366418	Wasn't that only a rumor?
8367018	8367799	I think that was a rumor.
8367839	8368219	I don't know.
8370682	8373905	Anyways, there's one of the games that they were talking about at E3.
8374045	8378910	That was Mag the Massive Action Game, I guess.
8379871	8384974	It will apparently be not free to play.
8385014	8390257	They are going to plan on charging either a yearly or monthly fee.
8390957	8396220	They will also have one-time fees for content downloads as well.
8397320	8404704	Also, I guess it mentions that they may have hosting partners like EA and Activision.
8406155	8430444	hmm but uh I don't know I guess this is sort of it didn't really seem like an MMO to me but it is kind of surprising though that an online game like this won't be free to play but I guess when you have like 256 players you probably need some serious network hardware for that hmm I don't know we'll just hopefully make the game cheap the buy then if that's the case you know like Warhawk or something where it's 40 bucks instead of 60 yeah
8432827	8433027	All right.
8433207	8435849	Well, remember when we used to learn a lot of things from our games?
8436230	8440233	Well, there was a little piece that's been circulating around different gaming blogs this week.
8440273	8447038	It's from the Educational Games Research blog, which kind of puts out information regularly about educational games.
8447338	8452262	They compiled a list this week, the top 10 most influential educational video games from the 1980s.
8452642	8454564	Now, keep in mind, it's just one guy's opinion.
8454644	8455284	It's someone who...
8456725	8457085	Number 3, SimCity
8478328	8479849	Number four, Reader Rabbit.
8480369	8481089	Remember Reader Rabbit?
8481729	8485591	Number five, Math Blaster, which was very similar to Reader Rabbit.
8485771	8489812	Or no, no, it weren't that they were similar, but it seems like both those games were kind of like hand-in-hand games.
8489852	8493254	I don't know about you guys, but it seemed like when I was younger, those games kind of were hand-in-hand.
8493634	8495675	Number six, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.
8496775	8498596	Number seven, Lemonade Stand.
8500362	8501364	8.
8500602	8501364	Number Munchers 9.
8503066	8503467	Zork 10.
8503808	8504268	Windows Solitaire
8515334	8543078	I guess that's something that you're supposed to you learn how to use the mouse with it so it's an educational game which I can see that but it's just very odd to see that on this list and number 11 M U L E which is strange because it's a top 10 list but they put Mule on this list as well which is a great game that I guess you know you kind of learn about barter and exchange in that game but I don't know if I'd call that an educational game either of particular interest why this story kind of piqued my interest because I've seen this around on different gaming blog sites this week um
8544324	8553110	I tackled this same topic a year ago on my personal blog that I was running for a while back when the All Games Radio Ning site was a little more popular.
8553430	8554872	In fact, I'll link it here in chat.
8555112	8556533	You can actually read my list here.
8557934	8560315	Sorry for those guys that are listening on the podcast.
8560335	8565199	You can't see this, but just go to allgamesradio.ning.com and look for my profile and you'll find this.
8566139	8571363	This was my list of the top 10 edutainment games of all time because I used to play a lot of them growing up.
8571803	8573505	Number 10, The Incredible Machine.
8574025	8575146	Rocky's Boots is a hell of a lot of fun.
8575166	8575686	Number eight, I just...
8598266	8601909	Apple Logo, because it was kind of like your first programming language that you would learn in school.
8602389	8604771	Number seven, I also put Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.
8605332	8607433	Number six, I also put Math Blasters.
8607974	8610856	Number five, I put a game called Cave of the Word Wizard.
8611216	8627729	It was a game that you had on the Commodore 64, and what made this game notable is that it actually used the Commodore 64's speech chip to actually say the names of words that you would have to spell out to the Word Wizard, where he'd take away your health, or your flashlight battery, and then if your battery goes out, you basically die of death.
8628919	8630200	You get eaten alive by bats.
8630580	8632982	No, I don't know, but you don't want your flashlight battery to run out.
8633423	8636245	And I put number four, where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego.
8636806	8639068	Number three, The Island of Dr. Brain.
8639508	8641390	That was a great educational title.
8641450	8643932	Again, it wasn't the 80s, so that's probably why it wasn't on the other guy's list.
8644352	8647715	And then I put number two, Number Munchers, and number one, The Oregon Trail.
8648035	8656602	So kind of funny that I don't know, you know, I don't profess to be an educational games expert, yet my list was pretty similar, except for the fact I had a couple games from the 90s in there.
8656983	8657123	So...
8658137	8659618	I don't know, I just thought I'd share that.
8660879	8663241	Nobody read the article when I posted it the first time.
8663321	8664482	Where's Lee's Resuit, Larry?
8665062	8667965	It's not an educational game, Loki.
8669045	8671287	I don't care what you think you learned from it.
8671327	8673389	It is not technically an educational game.
8675632	8679375	Amaze Satsuma is looking at my blog saying, man, did number munchers really look that bad?
8679435	8679876	Yes, it did.
8679896	8680856	The first version did.
8681157	8685120	They made prettier versions of it as time went on, but the very first version was very plain looking.
8685160	8687622	It was Atari 2600 style graphics.
8688022	8689964	All right, enough about educational games.
8690004	8691846	Let's get back to brain rotting games.
8692506	8696328	Hey, it's not brain rotting, it's just, um, well, violent.
8696428	8697909	And violence is always good.
8698549	8700930	It helps release tension or something.
8701651	8715658	Um, well, basically, this is, uh, some very good news for all of those people who had always, you know, had the, uh, you must defeat Shenlong to stand a chance and thinking it was, uh, you know, this was a hidden character or something.
8716438	8744232	um actually uh Goken who was supposed to be uh Ryu and Ken's uh teacher uh is going to be a uh a hidden character in the game but he's not playable he's just going to show up every so often beat the crap out of you toasty um but it is uh there is an unlock procedure for it but um he's gonna be hardcore tough sweet
8744798	8746038	So yeah, that's pretty happy.
8746619	8751240	Of course, you know, I have a feeling that someone's going to find some way to control him.
8751260	8752060	Blah, blah, blah.
8752281	8753561	Or he'll be a download character.
8754261	8754461	Yep.
8754841	8755302	Or something.
8755542	8756262	A pay to unlock.
8756522	8756822	Yep.
8757702	8765625	Well, if there's going to be another Grand Theft Auto game coming out, then there's got to be another controversy coming with it.
8766105	8771507	And of course, with the announcement of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, and now that more details are leaking out about it,
8772062	8773803	People are throwing a fit.
8773883	8786129	In fact, the British tabloid The Sun, which for some reason is now covering video game stuff every now and then, has a headline called Fury Over Drug Deal Vid Game.
8787009	8795974	And, of course, includes comments from a guy named Darren Gold of a support group called Drugs Line.
8796654	8800376	And anything using drug dealing as entertainment is sending out the wrong message.
8801196	8808619	Glamourism doesn't help our work in trying to educate kids of the dangers of substance misuse.
8810079	8810559	Awesome!
8810660	8811360	And you know what?
8811620	8817362	I agree with you in the fact that kids should be taught about drugs and how bad they are and stuff.
8817742	8823204	The other thing is kids shouldn't be playing this game because it's rated M. So, my god, people, please.
8823524	8827486	And in case, if you didn't notice, you can sell drugs in this game.
8827906	8828346	Because...
8829892	8833516	Grand Theft Auto likes to piss people off and controversy sells.
8833676	8834877	So, awesome.
8834977	8838761	But remember, parents, the ratings are on the box for a reason.
8839162	8842806	And you know, if you don't really give a shit about the ratings, then do your kids a favor and buy them porn.
8845339	8848060	DJ Darkknight in chat says, Winners don't use drugs.
8848821	8849941	Remember the old FBI warning?
8850202	8862568	Which, by the way, have you ever noticed that in, I don't think it's in Rock Band 1, but in Rock Band 2, there's an arcade level that you play in, and you can, if you actually look at the screens, one of them has that little FBI warning on it that says, Winners don't use drugs.
8863068	8864049	I thought that was pretty awesome.
8864089	8866070	Kudos to whoever at Harmonix snuck that in.
8867030	8867631	Good job, you.
8869140	8872323	Tiger Claw posted a link in chat of some pictures of the drug dealing minigame.
8873424	8877388	Which is strange because haven't no pictures of this game been released?
8877408	8878189	No, they have been.
8878229	8883955	They were in a game magazine called Game... Was it Nintendo Power?
8884095	8885416	Yes, I'm sure no one's heard of it.
8886057	8886177	Um...
8887819	8889100	It's like saying, oh my god, fire's hot.
8889120	8889240	It is? !
8916483	8919027	One more piece of kind of late breaking news for you guys.
8919087	8921831	It's a very big rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor.
8922324	8937734	Apparently, over at an Xbox India event that has happened over in Delhi, India, apparently it has been confirmed, I use that term loosely though, that there will be a slim Xbox 360 console that will be released in 2009.
8938955	8941137	This is coming from some Indian gaming blogs.
8942077	8951984	Apparently they are also saying that India is going to be getting some time with Fable 2, Gears of War 2, and Fallout 3 a week earlier than supposedly anyone else is supposed to be.
8952504	8953865	Hmm, I'm quite skeptical.
8953885	8957107	Well, they may get to try it a week before it comes out, but big deal.
8957287	8958088	Yeah, I guess that's true.
8959488	8960049	I don't know, though.
8960609	8965892	I mean, I guess a redesign of the console makes sense, although they never redesigned the original Xbox.
8965912	8967893	They didn't really let it live its full life, either.
8967933	8969915	They kind of rushed the 360 out, you know?
8971016	8973298	By the way, Major Nelson has actually commented on it.
8973378	8980706	He told popular blog Xbox360Fanboy that quote, I have no knowledge of an event in India and therefore anything related to one.
8981066	8984109	I think we all know that if we had something to say, we'd be saying it.
8985290	8985471	Hmm.
8986502	8987083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9008786	9011908	A digital camera built in to a console.
9012388	9014229	Yeah, because a console really uses the camera.
9014529	9016870	By the way, that reminds me, I got a buy... It was a DS joke.
9017110	9018211	Yeah, I know it was a DS joke.
9018351	9019071	I caught that.
9019232	9020312	Oh my god, really?
9020512	9021993	Was that something we talked about earlier?
9022013	9022893	Yeah, it was.
9023294	9024855	It's what we call like a loopback joke.
9025175	9026455	I know, that's so crazy.
9026515	9030437	It's like... Have you been paying attention for the past hour?
9030457	9033299	It's almost like foreshadowing, but in reverse, backshadowing.
9036058	9038059	Any other smart-ass comments before I open up the Skype line?
9038219	9046984	No, I was gonna say that more people will need to buy a camera for LittleBigPlanet, I guess, when it comes out, because it uses the PlayStation Eye heavily.
9047124	9049906	So are you encouraging people to run out and buy Eye of Judgment so they can get the camera?
9049946	9051066	Fuck no, but it's a waste of money.
9051106	9052107	Buy the camera, it's cheaper.
9052927	9053187	Alright.
9053207	9056389	1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call.
9056429	9058010	We have time for a couple of calls here tonight.
9058350	9061092	Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9061112	9061912	That's all one word.
9061972	9063033	You can call us right now.
9063073	9064534	The Skype line is open.
9065711	9066811	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9066831	9067191	Who's this?
9068071	9069032	Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
9069172	9070092	Hey, Ranma, how you doing?
9070972	9071652	Pretty good.
9072012	9074693	Tired from this weekend, but other than that, I'm doing all right.
9074833	9079514	So, you know, I got pictures on my cell phone from you this weekend, so I know what this means.
9079974	9082814	Ranma went to another con yet again.
9082834	9084275	And I have a surprise.
9084295	9086815	I want you to take a look at this picture I just posted in the chat room.
9086995	9087235	Okay.
9087255	9088855	You might call him a con man.
9089956	9091156	No, I'm a con whore.
9092236	9095577	I was dressed up as Ranma and people were stopping for my picture half the time
9120407	9122407	That's a very nice, cool little outfit though.
9122507	9124648	Oh, I'm looking at the gallery though at the bottom of this page.
9124668	9125868	There's somebody dressed as Kirby.
9125888	9126588	That looks cute.
9127989	9133870	It's actually somebody tall, but the costume is designed where they can just sit down inside it and roll around, kind of, sort of.
9134750	9135990	That's a cute little Kirby.
9136370	9139171	Okay, now you've got me ogling these pictures of cosplay.
9139211	9140731	I mean, how was the con?
9140811	9143112	And of course, you know, the gaming components of it.
9143152	9145332	Were there lots of gaming cosplay at the con?
9146698	9151001	Actually, no, and when it comes to gaming, what is this gaming that you speak of?
9152162	9152683	What do you mean?
9153623	9156545	There was only one game at the convention.
9157426	9158607	Wow, what was that?
9159848	9162590	Ubisoft's Naruto 2 for Xbox 360.
9162830	9165152	Of course, because that ties directly back into anime.
9166260	9169023	Yeah, they had like two big screens up for demo play.
9169203	9170424	That was the only game that they had.
9170825	9173127	That's a cool little Kingdom Hearts cosplay.
9173187	9174929	Where's the game room?
9175049	9175590	What's the game room?
9175630	9176230	I'm like, oh damn.
9176611	9181136	Sorry, I know this is horrible radio, but I'm looking at this Kingdom Hearts cosplay of somebody dressed up as a Heartless.
9181176	9182257	That's pretty awesome, actually.
9183686	9185166	I've seen a few of those running around.
9185426	9188027	So not a lot of gaming content at this convention.
9188067	9192268	Is it just because they just want to brandish themselves as strictly, you know, it is an anime festival after all.
9192588	9194829	They just want to be strictly anime and nothing else?
9194889	9196729	No, there's no general rule.
9196769	9198530	I guess it's just what people wanted.
9198630	9203071	It was just mostly, I really didn't see a lot of cosplay myself.
9203131	9205612	And I was in the dealer's room in the thicket of it all.
9206352	9211393	That's kind of weird though because it looks like there was quite a bit of gaming cosplay for a con that didn't really have gaming.
9214551	9215371	GoFig, you know?
9216211	9216712	Oh, that's cool.
9216732	9219772	There's a whole little trio there dressed up like the Whirlwinds with you, those characters.
9220652	9221373	That's kind of neat.
9222333	9222533	Huh.
9223953	9225493	So, good con?
9225894	9226414	Fun time?
9227554	9230394	It was an improvement over last year's, but it could have been better.
9230415	9232975	I walked in, and I'm like, where's the con?
9233015	9236156	I'm like, it's downstairs in the basement where it was last year.
9236256	9241617	And I'm thinking, since there was no digital life, it's going to be upstairs like Comic-Con was, but it wasn't.
9243035	9245697	Oh, this was the convention that goes on the same time as Digital Life?
9246558	9246778	Yes.
9247538	9250700	Oh, so Digital Life would have happened this past weekend.
9250720	9250921	Yes.
9251521	9252502	Oh, interesting.
9254283	9257105	Alright, well, anything else you want to say about the convention before we get some more calls?
9257905	9261488	Only thing that really annoyed me is that you have to pay extra for concerts and autographs.
9261628	9264610	I mean, to get Almanos autographed was $60.
9265111	9265391	What?
9266511	9267312	That's a little weird.
9267332	9268973	I haven't heard of cons doing that before.
9269033	9269914	They get away with it, though?
9270663	9273765	Yeah, comic book conventions are known for doing it, but not anime conventions.
9274085	9279829	But since I could not get Jamie her autograph, I got her a little gift to really cheer her up.
9280029	9282090	And I'm posting a picture of it in the chat room right now.
9282110	9284892	It has something to do with one of her all-time favorite movies.
9287233	9288214	I'm going to look right now, too.
9288594	9289194	Ha!
9289855	9290695	That's great.
9292356	9293097	That's great.
9293717	9294238	What is it?
9294358	9296679	Winchester Tavern?
9296719	9297880	Did you see Shaun of the Dead?
9298736	9300257	Oh my god, okay.
9300897	9301437	Wow.
9302338	9303318	I bought three of those.
9303999	9305900	That is kind of randomly awesome.
9305920	9306500	That is so sweet.
9307880	9310101	Where the hell did you find that at an anime con?
9311462	9313603	It was on a dealer's table with shirts.
9313703	9317005	You know, they're actually showing it today at cosplay now, so why not?
9317865	9320546	Yeah, I saw that at a couple other cons I've been to.
9321147	9325929	You know, they had Shaun of the Dead on the big screen in San Francisco not that long ago.
9326317	9327138	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9356718	9358960	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.
9359000	9364484	It is he who likes to whore a bunch of time in live shows and podcasts.
9364504	9367386	Yeah, I was going to say, you were just on Bobby's show like three hours ago.
9367866	9368587	No, that's all right.
9368667	9372049	We welcome you to our program, especially with all the work you've done for our show.
9372830	9374251	How can we not have you on the program?
9374271	9376592	And you have a good radio voice, so I have something good to say.
9376672	9378314	So what does he want to say tonight, Jason?
9379595	9388018	I was kind of offended by Loki's remarks going, I'm not just whoring time, I'm whoring time about the exact same thing all over again.
9388599	9394001	I have to take some offense to what Loki was saying about Fable 2 and all that nonsense.
9395321	9396142	I'm sorry, say that again?
9397022	9402744	Loki's developers are lazy, Fable 2, no online co-op immediately, this, that, and the other.
9403925	9406266	I have to take a little bit of offense to that.
9406366	9406926	Why is that?
9407850	9432883	developers are not lazy and maybe it's a bit of respect that I'm getting out of the fact that I work at a job that has a lot of developers and when things don't go right and you find out about them it becomes a losing situation no matter what you try to do you either cut the feature out you push the product back you release it in a hodgepodge and everybody complains and you fix it again
9435891	9438676	It's no simple matter, and developers typically aren't lazy.
9438816	9440959	Lazy developers are the people who make big rigs.
9441440	9446208	Besides that and New World Order, those people don't really exist in the software industry that means anything.
9448571	9457955	Jason, what about the fact that this was one of the biggest things that they were pushing in this game and now it's not there anymore?
9457995	9462238	That to me is kind of what makes it what they're doing here newsworthy.
9462538	9465959	If it had been just a little feature, I bet most of us wouldn't have blinked an eye at it.
9466259	9472462	But this is a pretty big thing that they were selling in the game and now they've just basically said, well, it's not really going to be there the first day.
9472602	9472983	Sorry.
9473003	9473443	Yeah.
9473743	9476645	Yeah, and the game was really big and the engine to power it too.
9477645	9480047	You have to have the game before you have the online component.
9480967	9486390	And if they had detrimental lag, rendering issues, or anything.
9486791	9491553	I haven't even read into the details, but just on a purely... I don't even know what the word is.
9491594	9496877	Just on a purely basic level, things don't go perfectly as planned.
9497217	9498998	How long have they had this release date?
9499943	9504689	that they're going to make because they're going to finish without this feature.
9504869	9508213	Why not push the release date two weeks back to give us all the features?
9509568	9536697	basically what it boils down to is there's no right or wrong way to do it but no matter what you do if you don't have a perfect product and nobody does if you don't have a perfect product it's a no-win situation something as big as this is definitely worse but it's a no-win situation to the developers who try and try and try and make one of these decisions because they're trying to make things better for their consumers
9537265	9538425	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9565302	9581771	BigRig's New World Order like I said there are definitely the examples but those people who are that blatant go away never to be heard from again and we laugh them on the way out well not really because I mean look at like EA a lot of their recent sports games have had pretty bad problems in them
9582411	9583212	and Mercenaries 2.
9583472	9587855	I have to keep going back to this but seriously, oh my god.
9588455	9593919	There is no way that these glitches, they couldn't have caught this stuff because I run into them so often in this game.
9594359	9599923	Anybody playtesting this stuff through would have run into at least a dozen of these each time.
9599963	9605347	Just to say though, sometimes I gotta, just in defense of people who QA games because I know we have a lot of them that actually listen to this show.
9605807	9609669	Sometimes they find these bugs and they report back and their superiors just don't care.
9609770	9611751	It's kind of one of those things where it's like we don't have the time to fix it.
9612932	9617435	Okay, well then, either way, it looks bad on the publishing company then.
9621477	9624760	Jason, any other thoughts on this?
9626721	9627622	I have spent my time.
9628542	9631024	I do have to echo SSJ100 Matt, though.
9631965	9636848	I did play NHL 08, the demo at least, but I'm sure that was indicative enough of the actual game.
9637677	9643141	and I had pucks going through the ice and I had a lot of funny things happening.
9643641	9645883	NHL 09 has been pretty solid so far.
9647084	9648125	I'm definitely enjoying that.
9648145	9649386	I think it's the first sports game.
9649446	9650947	It's a simulation that I like.
9653448	9654609	Even better than Blades of Steel?
9656311	9657431	Like I said, simulation.
9657892	9661194	Everything else of that age was arcade style.
9661234	9663576	This is actually a sim that I'm thoroughly enjoying.
9664127	9664828	Fair enough, fair enough.
9665128	9667530	All right, well, Jason, we're going to let you go so we can try and get one more call.
9667570	9669491	But thanks, of course, for the call and the insight.
9669732	9670252	We appreciate it.
9670272	9670612	Good night.
9670893	9671473	All right, have a good one.
9671493	9672214	Bye.
9672234	9677658	All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9677698	9684244	If you'd like to give us a call, we'll probably take like one more call and then call it a night here at Orange Lounge Radio and get to wrapping up the show.
9685424	9688187	Real quick, though, while we wait for the call, do we have any last-minute stories?
9689071	9691293	GameStop store their consoles in their bathroom
9702788	9702928	Ew.
9703429	9708816	Well, I heard this also from that, was it that Zero... I don't remember.
9708836	9712802	The guy that was mimicking Zero Punctuation, but bashing GameStop.
9712822	9715966	He said the same thing about consoles in the bathroom, and now they had video of it.
9716106	9718129	And it got taken down off of YouTube, apparently.
9718589	9718810	Hmm.
9719698	9731661	First of all, and I can say this from my experience with being in a number of game stops in the area, sometimes they're given such little storage space they actually have no choice but to put things in the bathroom.
9732381	9743483	But if anyone is urinating or defecating on the console, I would definitely think there'd be a way to tell by the box it's contained in.
9745644	9745924	So...
9747952	9749093	What smells in here?
9750334	9752775	Must be something the Sony's putting in the PlayStation.
9752815	9756057	I think there's absolutely no problem with them keeping a console in the bathroom.
9756898	9761541	As long as, you know, it's kept away from the toilet and sink, it's fine.
9762041	9764242	If they need the storage space, they need the storage space.
9764262	9773708	I just don't understand why a GameStop as a company, though, can't just, I don't know, spend some of that $7.5 billion that you're making or whatever and maybe... Two words.
9774329	9774769	Bottom line.
9775623	9784392	as long as no one's dipping their balls on them that's the most important thing next time I go buy a console it's a feature, what?
9784773	9789197	alright Luke, we've got somebody on hold on the line, I want to get to him hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9790078	9793562	hey there Orange Lounge Radio, this is Deekman hey Deekman, what's on your mind buddy?
9794278	9794718	Oh, not a lot.
9794738	9798579	I just wanted to pimp a game that I don't think I've really heard anybody talking about the last couple of weeks.
9798819	9799720	Oh, please, by all means.
9800460	9802501	Da Blob for Wii.
9802561	9805401	I don't know if you guys have seen this game, but it's awesome.
9805441	9808322	I've been playing it pretty much all day, and it's freaking fantastic.
9808462	9809843	I know I saw it at PAX.
9809883	9811883	I watched Loki play it at PAX, actually.
9811903	9814524	You remember the Blob game where you were painting the walls different colors?
9814784	9816385	Yeah, it was alright.
9816705	9817425	I've just been loving it.
9817505	9819346	It feels like playing Katamari Damacy.
9820146	9822187	It just gives me that same feeling of just a fun time.
9824622	9824862	Awesome.
9824902	9826643	So that's kind of what makes this game to you?
9826663	9829544	Because keep in mind, we only saw a few minutes of it at an expo.
9829564	9831966	We can't really form a full opinion on the game based on that.
9832026	9834507	So is it just the fun factor?
9834747	9836168	What kind of stuff do you do in this game?
9836188	9836868	What makes it so fun?
9837428	9846833	Basically, you just play as a gelatinous blob that can take on different colors, and then you roll around the city, and every time you touch a building or an object, it just explodes with color.
9847373	9852776	And you start off in a completely black and white, desolate world, and then you start touching buildings, and the whole city just comes to life.
9853496	9856457	It's really quite impressive, especially for a third-party Wii title.
9858038	9860419	That was that one that we saw at PAX, right?
9860899	9862739	Yeah, I don't remember if you were there.
9862779	9863960	I think you were elsewhere on the show.
9864320	9864880	I was there.
9865320	9866781	I grabbed the little comic book that came out with it.
9867841	9869602	That was lots of fun.
9870082	9872403	I really am interested in that one.
9873743	9876464	So you literally get to paint the town red, as Frisbee says in chat.
9877025	9877625	Yeah, pretty much.
9879165	9879545	It's great.
9879605	9880986	Seriously, check it out if you get the chance.
9881736	9882037	Nice.
9882117	9883539	Okay, well, we might have to check that out.
9883579	9885922	Is it only on Wii, or did they put it on other systems?
9885942	9889907	No, it's only on Wii, but like I said, it is easily the best third-party Wii title I've ever seen.
9890287	9890447	Huh.
9890968	9891449	Very cool.
9892190	9893652	Well, anything else you've been playing you want to share with us?
9895114	9896255	Somebody Amigo for the Wii.
9897417	9898378	How'd that turn out?
9900307	9900607	What's that?
9900787	9901768	How did that game turn out?
9901788	9904769	Because I've been curious to pick it up, but there's just so much other stuff I'm playing right now.
9904789	9906150	I haven't had a chance.
9906350	9907890	The controls are kind of here and there.
9907930	9913513	They're really touchy, but I think that once you play with it for a couple of hours, you really get the idea of how to control the game.
9913953	9915394	But that's really the only problem I've had with it.
9915434	9916714	The track list is fantastic.
9916774	9918995	Yeah, I'm enjoying it.
9920216	9920836	Very cool.
9921256	9921496	Huh.
9922257	9922597	All right.
9927904	9929706	Have you had fun posing in Samba de Amigo?
9929726	9930587	That's the most important part.
9931487	9933209	Oh yeah, and the hustle mode?
9933349	9934630	Fantastic.
9934650	9935591	They really beefed it up.
9936272	9937873	I'll play that mode more than the regular mode.
9938694	9939014	Awesome.
9939454	9940816	Alright, well thanks so much for the call, Dekeman.
9940836	9942157	We gotta go and wrap up the show.
9942757	9943298	Yep, no worries.
9943338	9943818	Take care, guys.
9943959	9944339	Have a good one.
9946428	9946768	DarkSakura?
9965603	9968705	My last minute story is I like pie.
9969426	9970306	That's not a story.
9970666	9971627	I do have one more.
9971647	9978491	Remember I talked about last week the Wii ISO loader that got leaked out and then the guy making it when it...
9980161	9982162	Looks like a Wenny Coco or something like that.
9982342	9983802	Wen and Coco.
9984363	9987744	You know, basically he was pissed off about the leak or something like that.
9987864	9992726	And so he's like, well, you know, I'm not going to work on it anymore.
9992806	9996747	And then later on the week, well, maybe I'll work on it some more.
9996767	9999008	Well, I missed the attention, so.
9999408	10001869	Yeah, maybe I'll finish it now, so.
10003120	10005522	So yeah, ISO litter may be coming at some point.
10005723	10006523	Hooray!
10007745	10014511	Okay, well, if there's no other last minute stories, then we're going to go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thought and try to wrap up tonight's show.
10014811	10015772	We'll start off with Tiara.
10015832	10017614	Thanks so much for joining us here tonight.
10017634	10018415	I hope you had fun.
10019015	10021198	And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
10023500	10023660	No.
10023680	10023720	No.
10024241	10024441	No.
10024901	10025802	Just a simple no.
10026042	10028322	Well, have a safe flight back to Las Vegas and come see us again.
10028803	10029403	I definitely will.
10029443	10029763	Thank you.
10029983	10030263	Awesome.
10030803	10032004	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10032264	10035845	My final thought is I went this weekend and played Airsoft, and it was fun.
10035965	10039126	So my gun, I have the P90 or whatever.
10039166	10040867	I have these 300-round clips.
10041367	10044568	And I hated having to run out of ammo and change clips and stuff.
10044628	10045788	It just was inconvenient.
10045828	10046448	So I bought a...
10048649	10051010	1500 round box magazine for it now.
10051410	10052830	I will never run out of ammo.
10053370	10053650	Ever.
10054351	10054951	Goodie, goodie.
10055631	10056811	Just don't bring that to the studio.
10057591	10060332	I will bring it to the studio one of these days.
10060352	10063573	Because somebody's going to get shot, especially if another Dance Hero argument breaks out.
10063693	10066034	Which I'm surprised did not come up on Skype tonight.
10066274	10067154	The Dance Hero thing.
10067254	10067834	Maybe next week.
10067914	10068614	Maybe we'll get some emails.
10069735	10074596	My final thought would be I had a bite of John's Chinese food and it was really good.
10075276	10078658	It was really good because I haven't had deep fried chicken in a long time.
10081119	10084620	And a nice little humanized Mega Man picture there that DarkSakura is showing me.
10084660	10086121	This is going to be my final thought.
10087061	10088162	Okay, then what is your final thought?
10088672	10090953	Everyone needs to go look at Masao's artwork.
10091774	10105721	It's at www.5c.biglobe.ne.jp You are going to post that in chat, right?
10105801	10106102	I am.
10106182	10107182	That's a long ass link.
10107662	10115787	It's basically this guy that does weird video game art and kind of scary Ronald McDonald art, but he does Mario and Luigi.
10115807	10115867	Wow.
10117800	10120921	I'm interested in the scary Ronald McDonald art.
10120941	10123242	The artist is Masao, M-A-S-A-O.
10124442	10125443	Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
10125623	10131565	Well, if you didn't have a pen and paper to write down that link fast enough, and sadly you weren't in chat tonight, you should come join us for a live show sometime.
