0	13840	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.
13840	20320	Tonight September 28, 2008, a Banjo-Kazooie remake gets dated, Dance Hero gets trademarked,
20320	27440	and an old friend of ours gets the boot.
27440	31840	Orange Lounge Radio.
31840	33640	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
33640	36120	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36120	39680	We are that podcast on the internet where every gamer has a voice, because every week
39680	43880	we talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and we invite
43880	46400	you to come be a part of our program.
46400	50340	You can join us in chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, you can talk to us by phone later, send us
50340	52160	an email, however you want to do it.
52160	56000	You guys are going to help steer the show tonight, but we'll be here leading you through
56000	58800	the next few hours where we talk about the latest and greatest video gaming.
58800	59800	My name is Rob Roberts.
59800	62960	Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
62960	63960	Hi.
63960	65160	How are you doing?
65160	66160	I'm okay.
66160	67800	Your voice sounds a little better this week.
67800	68800	It is.
68800	69800	Alright, good to hear.
69800	72760	Also, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
72760	73760	Hi.
73760	74760	How you doing?
74760	75760	Good.
75760	76760	You have a stack of cheeseburgers.
76760	79400	I don't know if the Justin.TV users can see us, or they can't, because it's hidden behind
79400	80720	your laptop here.
80720	83120	He has a stack of cheeseburgers.
83120	84120	It's only two.
84120	88080	Because, I mean, McDonald's cheeseburgers are like micro cheeseburgers.
88080	93360	But I'm laughing because he literally has a stack of cheeseburgers.
93360	97240	As we'll get into it a little bit later in the program, I can't put them on the floor
97240	100880	because, oh yeah, there's acts of nature attack.
100880	104700	There's like, like here in the studio, which, you know, we have a real high tech studio.
104700	106580	It's basically a converted garage.
106580	109920	We have like ants or something that live under the floor.
109920	116280	So the funny thing is if you put food on the ground, the ants will rise up underneath and
116280	119360	like just storm the food is what Loki found out last week.
119360	120360	Yes.
120360	124520	I should have learned the first time it happened weeks prior to that, but I thought it was
124520	125520	a fluke.
125520	126680	I was like ants in the garage?
126680	128400	There's no ants in the garage.
128400	129920	Ants in my garage?
129920	130920	All right.
130920	133600	Anyhow, let's also say hello to a special guest we have tonight.
133600	137440	And it's not very often that we have a fourth person joining us in studio anymore.
137440	138960	What happened to the locals?
138960	140040	Locals don't love us anymore.
140040	141040	They found women.
141040	142040	I guess.
142040	143040	I guess so.
143040	147040	Well, so we had to bring a woman on our show and we had to bring a non-local woman on our
147040	148400	show, but we love her.
148400	150860	Her name is Tiara all the way from Las Vegas.
150860	151860	Say hello.
151860	152860	Hi.
152860	153860	How are you?
153860	154860	Not too bad.
154860	155860	All right.
155860	156860	How was the flight?
156860	157860	Good.
157860	158860	The flight was really good.
158860	162560	They messed up my ticket or the terminals were down for the like automatic ticket printing
162560	165920	instead of having to go to the flight attendant type people.
165920	166920	Right.
166920	168920	And so I got upgraded to first class for 20 bucks.
168920	169920	Nice.
169920	170920	Yeah.
170920	171920	Did you see anyone famous in first class?
171920	175520	No, just a bunch of old people.
175520	176520	Famous old people.
176520	177520	Awesome.
177520	178520	All right.
178520	179520	Well, welcome.
179520	180520	Welcome to the show tonight.
180520	183960	And of course, the other reason why Tiara was here, she didn't come to join us just
183960	187840	for Orange Lounge Radio, although, you know, that would be nice, but I came for Journey.
187840	188840	Yes.
188840	192440	Part of the way Tiara came so we could go see Journey and Heart and Cheap Trick.
192440	195360	And if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks, you know, we don't talk about
195360	196360	games.
196360	197540	We talk about our personal lives.
197540	199160	We love Journey.
199160	200760	And if you're Jamie, we love Heart.
200760	203360	And if you're me, you love both, honestly.
203360	204360	You really do.
204360	205360	And Cheap Trick.
205360	206360	But Heart is great.
206360	207360	Cheap Trick.
207360	208360	They're okay.
208360	209360	Although they're a bunch of divas because I met them years ago.
209360	210360	But anyway, Heart and Journey are great.
210360	212480	Now, here's the sad news is that we went to the concert, right?
212480	215560	As a lot of folks have been listening to us weeks and weeks, we talk about this.
215560	217000	We finally went to the concert.
217000	222040	What should have been a 40 minute drive up to Marysville took us two and a half hours
222040	223920	to get up there because of traffic and everything.
223920	229520	So sadly, we had to listen to Ann Wilson belt out alone from the parking lot, which was
229520	230840	kind of sad.
230840	233100	But she still was really good.
233100	234840	That woman, her voice is amazing.
234840	235840	Yes.
235840	238560	And we did get to, and for you Guitar Hero players, we did get to walk in there in time
238560	240980	to hear Barracuda, which was good.
240980	242560	So that was, I had a good time.
242560	246360	And then of course we got to see the whole Journey and, you know, I know we're not a
246360	249600	music program, but I will tell you Journey's new lead singer, I approve.
249600	250840	He's very, very good.
250840	255960	Yeah, I was really surprised because I didn't know what to expect, but he's very good.
255960	260600	And you know, apparently their latest CD is their biggest selling one in like 20 years.
260600	261600	That's what they said.
261600	264480	I think Neil Sean said that part of it.
264480	268920	So hey, all I'm saying is let's get some more Journey tracks and rock band, please.
268920	269920	That would be great.
269920	273100	Speaking of rock band, let's talk about your gaming week, Stark Sakura.
273100	275460	How was your gaming week?
275460	284440	We played some rock band over the weekend and Dan downloaded Mega Man 9, which was really,
284440	285440	really, really cool.
285440	294540	I mean, I was totally just in old school heaven watching, you know, a lot of the stuff.
294540	298760	And of course it played a little Ragnarok as usual.
298760	305320	And that's really, really about it for my gaming week.
305320	306800	Awesome.
306800	307800	You know, one thing I love about Mega Man 9.
307800	309400	I was busy dealing with other things.
309400	310400	Oh, sure.
310400	315160	I wasn't able to get Mega Man 9 this week because I, you know, I have my little thing
315160	318400	going on with the Wii where I'm not downloading anything else on the Wii.
318400	323000	And I don't have a PlayStation 3 yet, although I'm thinking next week's the week.
323000	327680	And then Xbox 360, I don't know, I just can't imagine playing a classic video game on that
327680	330400	Xbox 360 controller because that D-pad kind of sucks.
330400	333040	So I think I'm going to have to get it on PlayStation 3 if nothing else.
333040	334640	So hopefully soon.
334640	336600	But I love listening to the soundtrack.
336600	339800	They just, it's, it's perfect for an old school Mega Man game.
339800	343120	It's even, you can even use flicker to your advantage.
343120	344280	Nice.
344280	348000	Like if you get hit and you're going through a tough spot, you just like get hit once so
348000	350360	that you flicker enough to get through the hard stuff.
350360	351360	Nice.
351360	353680	So maybe there's a reason not to turn it off.
353680	355440	It's it.
355440	357400	It's old school Mega Man.
357400	358400	That's all I can say.
358400	359400	All right.
359400	361220	Loki, how was your gaming week?
361220	363440	My gaming week was all right.
363440	370280	I played a bit of Mercenaries, Mercenaries 2, and actually this week I finally got to
370280	374200	try the co-op online and it's pretty fun actually.
374200	379280	I was playing with my friend Sean who just picked up the game and I swear to God this
379280	382360	game gets even more glitchier the longer I play it.
382360	384280	It's, it's awesome though.
384280	385280	I like that.
385280	386520	Did Loki just say more glitchier?
386520	387960	I think he did.
387960	390620	Yes, more glitchier, seriously.
390620	391620	More glitchier.
391620	396320	I could say it gets even glitchier, but no, it's more glitchier.
396320	397320	That's a technical term.
397320	398720	You're the most smartest host I've ever met.
398720	399960	I am the most smartest.
399960	400960	Smarterist.
400960	404280	Can we get that in an iTunes review please?
404280	405280	Smarterist.
405280	409080	The most, the more, this show is great, but it could be more glitchier.
409080	410080	More glitchier.
410080	413920	No, but the game is extremely glitchy.
413920	416480	There's absolutely no way that they tested this thing.
416480	420080	I think they just said, ah, fuck it, let's just release it.
420080	421160	And that's what they did.
421160	424160	So yeah, lots of things that are messed up.
424160	427600	I'm trying to think of some of the fun highlights of that.
427600	432400	There was a helicopter we couldn't get into because, or no, we got into the helicopter,
432400	434400	but it wouldn't fly.
434400	435640	It was a brand new helicopter too.
435640	439880	The guy had just dropped it off for me, got into the helicopter, propeller would not spin.
439880	440880	I was like, well this is useless.
440880	443320	Maybe you were just too fat for the copter.
443320	444320	No.
444320	448600	Hey, remember, this is my in-game persona.
448600	449600	Not real life.
449600	450600	Okay.
450600	453520	And then of course, you know, more Grand Theft Auto IV.
453520	455680	Did you just have maybe too much baggage in the back?
455680	459320	Because I think that's what happened to Aliyah.
459320	467000	Well I was carrying around this guy from United Petroleum, the fake oil company in the game.
467000	470720	But yeah, the game is just horribly glitched out, which is awesome.
470720	473500	Anyways, on to other things.
473500	479600	I played a game, a Flash game actually, called, I want to say it was Me and My Dad.
479600	484800	It's by the same people that do, you know, Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, and it's
484800	492320	basically you're this guy, I don't know, it's like some sort of demon kid who goes around
492320	494280	beating up other kids.
494280	498480	Just like most of the people in the game are completely harmless and just running around
498480	500800	and you just brutally beat them to death.
500800	501800	It's awesome.
501800	504700	This sounds like a Loki dream game.
504700	505700	It's awesome.
505700	515920	So I played that a little bit, and let's see, also tried a little bit of Disaster Day of
515920	521560	Crisis, and that game is so cheesy.
521560	523480	It's pretty fun though.
523480	525360	But kind of a really unique game.
525360	530160	It combines a little bit of like, platforming, with a little bit of like, some stuff that
530160	535920	reminds me of Time Crisis a bit, and just, I don't know, it has kind of the vibe of like
535920	538520	Ghost Squad or like a Time Crisis game.
538520	539520	Very over-the-top.
539520	542600	Okay, I gotta go back a little bit, rewind a little bit, because Chatroom brings up a
542600	543600	good point.
543600	547100	So, you know, first comment of the night from Shaoran in our chatroom, chat.ownershotshot.com.
547100	550040	Why is it called Me and My Dad then?
550040	552460	I don't know.
552460	557800	I never saw the guy's dad at any point in this, well, in the, actually the title screen
557800	563440	did have like a larger version of the main character, who I guess was his dad, but I
563440	564640	don't understand what Me and My Dad...
564640	566240	Maybe it's like a twist ending, and then...
566240	570080	Maybe, I don't know, but maybe your dad joins you later and you can beat more people up,
570080	573620	I don't know, but it's, yeah, that's what it was called, at least.
573620	577760	They had a link on Destructoid for it, so if you want to check it out, just kind of
577760	579640	browse back a few pages.
579640	585140	But yeah, so that was fun, and of course I played more Castle Crashers, actually my headset
585140	593040	that I use on my PC, my headphones, they kind of died, so I went out and got some nice,
593040	601040	the Triton AX360s, so they're like 5.1 headsets now, and those are awesome, so I'm looking
601040	605560	forward to playing more with those, and yeah, that's pretty much it.
605560	606560	Awesome.
606560	609640	Tiara, do you have anything you want to share with your gaming week, types of games you've
609640	610640	been playing?
610640	615440	Well, I haven't really had a chance to play a lot of games recently, since I just started
615440	622320	with school again, so, but I did play Ragnarok with Jamie, and we played Rock Band, and we
622320	627320	made Dan download Jimmy Buffett, so that I could sing Margaritaville.
627320	628680	Nice.
628680	629680	So you were the singer?
629680	630680	Sometimes.
630680	632000	And let me guess, Jamie's bass player?
632000	636860	Actually, I did play a bit of bass, but I also made Dan get Skullcrusher Mountain.
636860	638860	Very cool.
638860	644720	Alright, so that's pretty much it then, Rock Band, and learning.
644720	650600	That's pretty much it, and then Final Fantasy Tactics, and Joan of Arc on the PSP.
650600	653800	I don't know much about Joan of Arc, what's this game?
653800	660560	It's basically a tactics game, like Final Fantasy Tactics, except for it stars Joan
660560	665680	of Arc, and it takes the whole history of what happened during the time when she was
665680	670480	around, and turns it into this thing where magical demons are attacking, and you have
670480	673360	to defeat them to save France.
673360	674360	Interesting.
674360	679600	Based on a true story.
679600	682120	They took some creative liberties, I think, but okay.
682120	684780	Yeah, just a few.
684780	685780	Very cool.
685780	686780	But is it fun?
686780	687780	That's the question.
687780	690400	Well, if you like tactics games, then yes, it's fun.
690400	693760	And I think, you know, it's kind of smart, even though they replaced all the people that
693760	699880	were invading France and everything with quote-unquote demons, it's still like if a kid played it,
699880	702220	they might learn some history out of it.
702220	707640	Because a lot of it is based on actual fact, but then, you know, you've got the weird stuff.
707640	712040	Except for the demons and the magic, yeah.
712040	713040	Very nice.
713040	714040	Alright, cool.
714040	715960	Sounds like a very interesting game.
715960	716960	My Gaming Week.
716960	719960	Things I've been playing, pretty much, not a lot of new stuff, I have to say.
719960	722000	I've still been addicted to Rock Band 2.
722000	725840	Played a little bit more Warhammer, although I don't, sadly, know a lot of other people
725840	726840	on it.
726840	728860	I don't know how much longer I'm going to be playing Warhammer because of that fact.
728860	735080	I know there's some OLR listeners on it, and maybe I'll try to meet up with some of them.
735080	737400	Then World of Warcraft, of course.
737400	741920	And I guess the only new thing I really checked out this week was Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live
741920	742920	Marketplace.
742920	744400	How could I forget playing that?
744400	745400	Alright.
745400	746400	Well, what did you think, Loki?
746400	747600	Oh, it's awesome.
747600	750120	It's exactly how I remembered it.
750120	752880	It is, except I was kind of surprised that, well, I'm not.
752880	757760	I mean, it's basically like the Doom port, where they didn't really redo anything, you
757760	759240	know what I mean?
759240	764000	But it does bring back a lot of great memories, because, man, I played a lot of Duke Nukem
764000	765000	3D when I was in college.
765000	768320	I kind of wish they had it, but I know, I understand why they didn't have it.
768320	773220	I wish they had the build editor in there to make their own levels, that'd be awesome.
773220	777360	It's too bad that you can't do some type of, like, yeah, as soon as you change levels.
777360	781720	I'm disappointed, there's no Atomic Edition in there as well, either.
781720	788120	All the added, they had a few added weapons, and, you know, the brand new levels, including
788120	790440	the one that, like, parodied Disneyland.
790440	792320	I'm disappointed that wasn't in there.
792320	793960	Maybe it's a download pack later, who knows?
793960	794960	I hope.
794960	795960	Download content, who knows?
795960	799400	But it's a very faithful port, and if you've never played Duke Nukem 3D, at least check
799400	800400	out the demo.
800400	803760	I see, I think you could do a multiplayer demo, if I'm not mistaken, so you can even
803760	806120	kind of taste a little bit of what that is all about.
806120	809600	And you can play the first two levels, at least, and it's fun.
809600	813120	Be sure to look around everywhere in that first level, because you can blow through
813120	817200	that first level in, like, a minute, but if you really stop to look around, there's tons
817200	819040	of secrets in the level.
819040	822400	Otherwise very similar to the Doom port we saw not that long ago.
822400	824240	That was pretty much it, though, for my gaming week.
824240	828040	Not a whole lot else to report, nothing really new, otherwise.
828040	833360	So let's talk about housekeeping real quick before we get into gaming news tonight.
833360	837520	I've had to pull out of E for All, which kind of stinks, but I am not going to be attending
837520	841720	E for All this weekend, after all, and I really apologize to those listeners that were planning
841720	843120	on going.
843120	846920	You know, please still continue to go to the All Games booth, which is being co-run by
846920	849000	the Championship Gaming series.
849000	850080	It's going to be pretty cool.
850080	853680	They're going to have some old school gaming celebrities there, and I think that's kind
853680	856160	of like one of the themes they're going with, is old school.
856160	859320	And I think it's going to be a lot of fun, and I'm really sad I can't go.
859320	861760	But do head out, especially if you're in the area.
861760	864200	If you're in the LA area, please head out to E for All this weekend.
864200	865200	I think you'll have a lot of fun.
865200	867400	Sadly, I've had to pull out.
867400	870480	I'll just say it's kind of related to, you might remember, if you've been listening to
870480	873520	the show for a while, about six months ago, I had some medical issues.
873520	878000	I'm okay, don't worry, but I'm probably going to have to have a surgery coming up, and I
878000	880200	have to get evaluated this weekend, and all that stuff.
880200	881800	So it has to do with all that.
881800	884720	So we'll let you know more details on that as it comes up.
884720	888840	Don't worry, it's gallbladder, it's very common, tons of people have had it.
888840	890360	I'll be fine.
890360	892000	So that's that.
892000	894320	All right, so let's get into some gaming news.
894320	895840	I don't really have a lot else to plug in housekeeping.
895840	899960	I can't think of anything else going on, except for the fact that episode 300, provided everything
899960	905240	stays on schedule, will be in like four weeks, which is crazy if you think of that.
905240	909680	300 shows, and at about, most of them have been three hours a piece.
909680	911280	I mean, some were two, some were three.
911280	913800	So let's say you said like two and a half hours for each one.
913800	919880	That's still like, what, 750 hours at least of content we've done over the years.
919880	923680	It's like a million bajillion hours of content.
923680	924680	Tons.
924680	925680	All right.
925680	928600	All right, anyway, let's move on.
928600	929600	Gaming news.
929600	930600	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
930600	936400	Well, there's a Nintendo 64 game that's quite a classic that I never played, but looks interesting
936400	937400	nonetheless.
937400	938400	Banjo-Kazooie.
938400	946160	We knew this was coming, the sort of remake or update to it, and it is coming now exclusively
946160	955760	to the Xbox Live Arcade on November 26, and it will be running you 1,200 Microsoft Points,
955760	963440	or free if you happen to pre-order at specific locations like GameStop, GameCrazy, Amazon,
963440	964680	whatnot.
964680	967920	And I believe you do get it a few weeks early that way, too.
967920	976640	Also announced in the same press release is Banjo-Tooie will be coming as well early 2009.
976640	977640	So that's pretty cool.
977640	983880	One other unique thing about this as well, there will be a stop and swap mode, and what
983880	989640	that's exactly going to do is progress that's made in the Xbox Live Arcade game will unlock
989640	993400	things in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.
993400	994560	So that's kind of cool.
994560	998840	That's an interesting little crossover, but just kind of a ploy to get people to spend
998840	999840	their money twice, right?
999840	1000840	Yeah.
1000840	1003820	But, I mean, it's not like they're the first people to ever do that, so...
1003820	1004820	By commando.
1004820	1008000	Except they didn't really have it locked, you know, it was more of a code, though, that
1008000	1009000	they gave out in that game.
1009000	1012840	Well, plus, you know, sometimes there's like DS and Wii things that kind of do that, like
1012840	1016040	I'm thinking Geometry Wars had, I think, a certain mode that you could only get if you
1016040	1017040	had both or something.
1017040	1018040	Yeah.
1018040	1019040	I think.
1019040	1020040	Don't quote me on that.
1020040	1022520	But sometimes, you know, you have those, you know, you gotta own both to get a special
1022520	1026040	something or an unlock, so not too incredibly uncommon.
1026040	1028640	Plus Alien Hominin and Castle Crashers, right?
1028640	1029640	Yes.
1029640	1030640	Get a new character if you have them both?
1030640	1031640	Yeah.
1031640	1032640	So.
1032640	1033640	Are you looking forward to Banjo-Kazooie?
1033640	1034640	You know, this is one of those games I never...
1034640	1035640	I gotta be...
1035640	1036640	I'm gonna be perfectly honest.
1036640	1037640	I never really played Banjo-Kazooie.
1037640	1041200	It was kind of during that period of my life where I wasn't playing video games a whole
1041200	1043320	lot because I was in college.
1043320	1045560	This is the one, one of those big series.
1045560	1048200	I never owned a Nintendo 64 until years and years later.
1048200	1050060	I never really played this series.
1050060	1054140	But I'll check it out, especially when it's on the Live Arcade, the re-release.
1054140	1055840	I'm not interested in the least.
1055840	1056840	Why is that?
1056840	1057840	Just never liked the first one?
1057840	1058840	It's too childish for me now.
1058840	1059840	Ooh.
1059840	1060840	Well, it's not necessarily that.
1060840	1064360	It just looks like... like a generic platformer game.
1064360	1067920	And I know it's not really generic because it was probably one of the first better platformer
1067920	1072120	games out there, but right now, it's not the type of game I'm into.
1072120	1080320	And unfortunately, my game, you know, real estate, I guess, is too packed right now.
1080320	1083880	I have too many games I have to play in a short amount of time.
1083880	1087720	And Saints of R2 is gonna be coming out, and I won't give a shit about this game when Saints
1087720	1088720	of R2 comes out.
1088720	1092760	Kiki Nico in chat says, Rob, it's one of the best on Nintendo 64.
1092760	1093760	I understand.
1093760	1094760	I realize that.
1094760	1095760	It's just I never got around to it.
1095760	1098080	Do either of you ladies have an opinion on Banjo-Kazooie?
1098080	1099200	I never liked it.
1099200	1100200	Why?
1100200	1101200	Same thing?
1101200	1102200	You never liked Banjo-Kazooie?
1102200	1103200	Well, no.
1103200	1106040	I mean, this is also coming from the person who just, what, a couple years ago was ranting
1106040	1107040	and raving about Magic Pen-Gel.
1107040	1110920	Yeah, Magic Pen-Gel is fucking awesome.
1110920	1111920	I still say that in the other one.
1111920	1113720	With a penis monster that squirts.
1113720	1114720	Wow.
1114720	1115720	We're so mature.
1115720	1119440	But I just never cared for how the game plays.
1119440	1120440	That's just me.
1120440	1126520	I never liked the sort of... it was like, it would be more fun if it was actually side,
1126520	1130480	but it was that behind view that just didn't seem very fun to me.
1130480	1131480	Wow.
1131480	1132480	Interesting that none of...
1132480	1134320	I mean, I don't really have a hate or like opinion on it.
1134320	1136120	I just flat out never really played it.
1136120	1139000	Interesting, though, that overall in studio here we're negative.
1139000	1141200	But to balance this out, there's positive in chat.
1141200	1143800	Frisbee says Banjo-Kazooie equals heart.
1143800	1148720	Kikaniko says they're not liking this BK Bash cast.
1148720	1150120	I'm not bashing the game.
1150120	1153080	It's just like, I don't want to play it.
1153080	1155280	It just doesn't look like something I would enjoy.
1155280	1158440	Here's a question I'll ask you, though, is that one place that Microsoft's really been
1158440	1161240	struggling is appealing to the family demographic.
1161240	1163840	They've always kind of been the hardcore gaming system.
1163840	1167840	This is a lot better than Rocky and Bullwinkle or the fucking crappy SpongeBob game that
1167840	1168840	they had on there.
1168840	1172000	Or, wasn't there like a Shrek game on there, too?
1172000	1173000	Yeah.
1173000	1174000	Either way, those all sucked.
1174000	1177600	I'd rather have, like, you know, you're gonna have kids playing an Xbox Live or a K-game,
1177600	1178600	perfect.
1178600	1179600	This would be perfect for them.
1179600	1180600	Alright.
1180600	1183000	Don't let them play that crappy, like, SpongeBob crap.
1183000	1185080	That Rocky and Bullwinkle game was very disappointing.
1185080	1188600	Especially, you know, if you love Rocky and Bullwinkle, too, it just pains you to look
1188600	1189600	at that game.
1189600	1194960	It's just, that may have been good in, like, the 80s or earlier.
1194960	1201000	I mean, it's just now, it's like they tried to bring back, what was that, the, um, what
1201000	1204240	was the race game, Wacky Races.
1204240	1205480	Wacky Races is great.
1205480	1208360	Yeah, Wacky Races is great for the people that remember it.
1208360	1211680	Kids do not know what the fuck Wacky Races is.
1211680	1213760	I don't even think I know what Wacky Races is.
1213760	1215720	I barely know what Wacky Races is.
1215720	1219320	Wacky Races was also in the same tone as the Laugh-Olympics.
1219320	1220320	Remember that?
1220320	1221320	No.
1221320	1226120	All the Hanna-Barbera characters in big competitions, only Wacky Races is...
1226120	1227120	Oh!
1227120	1228120	Okay, yes, I remember now.
1228120	1229120	Okay.
1229120	1230120	Okay.
1230120	1231120	I personally preferred the Laugh-Olympics.
1231120	1233680	It's, it's kinda like the Justice League of these types of cartoons, right?
1233680	1237480	But it was all Hanna-Barbera, so you had the Great Grape Ape and...
1237480	1241580	Yes, yes, yes, and, and, yeah, Huckleberry Hound and all those people were doing Battle
1241580	1242580	with the Flintstones.
1242580	1243580	I love Hanna-Barbera.
1243580	1244580	I just didn't...
1244580	1246360	Yeah, but see, that wasn't in this one, though.
1246360	1249000	At least this game did not have, like, the Flintstones or anything.
1249000	1250000	Any...
1250000	1251000	I don't know.
1251000	1252000	Original...
1252000	1254560	I think the licensing fee for a game like that would be nuts.
1254560	1257080	Dark Tetsuya says there should be a Laugh-Olympics video game.
1257080	1258080	I just couldn't imagine...
1258080	1259080	That might be cool.
1259080	1260760	But the licensing fee would be atrocious, I would think.
1260760	1264640	Well, it's all Hanna-Barbera, so I would think that the Laugh-Olympics...
1264640	1267640	Laugh-Olympics would probably be a lot better than Wacky Races.
1267640	1269480	Wacky Races sucked, so...
1269480	1271360	All right, that's that.
1271360	1274800	Well, the news about Banjo-Kazooie was really big news this week, but there was other big
1274800	1278440	news, especially in the legal world this week, and I'm talking about Spore.
1278440	1282160	And you know, the DRM in Spore has been a very controversial point of order where, you
1282160	1286920	know, you can only install the game on so many systems and, of course, secure ROM, right?
1286920	1291040	Very controversial device, if you haven't heard of it, which I don't see how you could
1291040	1292400	not have by now.
1292400	1296680	It's that thing that kind of installs on your computer to kind of monitor what's going in
1296680	1297680	the...
1297680	1298680	I don't even...
1298680	1299680	What is the point of secure ROM?
1299680	1301640	How does it install into your computer?
1301640	1304040	What exactly are they looking for?
1304040	1307320	I guess to make sure you're not burning a copy of the game or something?
1307320	1308720	I don't know.
1308720	1310280	Well, obviously some folks are...
1310280	1311720	It doesn't work very well.
1311720	1318040	I mean, if I didn't want to play Spore Online, I could easily crack that stupid code with
1318040	1323960	one little patch, but unfortunately I've already installed it on my system, and not that it
1323960	1326800	really matters, I'm not playing the game anyway, so...
1326800	1327800	Whatever.
1327800	1333600	Well, a class action lawsuit has been filed against Electronic Arts this week over that
1333600	1336400	DRM, and specifically kind of targeting secure ROM.
1336400	1340960	This class action lawsuit is claiming that Spore contains, quote, a second undisclosed
1340960	1346360	program called secure ROM, a form of digital rights management for computer games.
1346360	1347880	Consumers are not warned about the program.
1347880	1353160	The program installs without any notice, and they cannot uninstall the program either.
1353160	1356960	The program is, quote, secretly installed at the command and control center of the computer,
1356960	1364920	including zero, or the kernel, and surreptitiously operated, overseeing function and operation
1364920	1368740	on the computer, preventing the computer from operating under certain circumstances and
1368740	1371240	or disrupting hardware operations.
1371240	1375720	So it was a class action lawsuit filed against Electronic Arts who's put this game out there
1375720	1381280	basically saying, you are installing a second program without my consent on my computer.
1381280	1383680	That's basically the core of it.
1383680	1384680	And I agree with that.
1384680	1388480	I agree that that makes sense, because they aren't saying, hey, we're installing this
1388480	1392560	on here, or giving you a way to uninstall it, say, if you uninstall the game.
1392560	1397000	It stays on your computer forever.
1397000	1398000	What do you guys think?
1398000	1399640	What will become of this lawsuit?
1399640	1401460	And I pose this question to our chat room as well.
1401460	1403180	Do you think this lawsuit has any merit?
1403180	1405440	Is this a sue-happy America?
1405440	1407640	What's going to happen, you think?
1407640	1408640	Settlement?
1408640	1410000	Any thoughts?
1410000	1414440	Honestly, I think that they're going to have to settle, at least just to get people to
1414440	1416240	shut up.
1416240	1419760	But there's other companies have been doing this for ages.
1419760	1429080	For example, I think Dell does the DNA program, I think, to see if you're, God, I can't remember
1429080	1432840	what exactly it's about, but they install a program.
1432840	1435380	But then again, I guess if you buy a Dell, you know you're eventually going to get this
1435380	1436600	on there.
1436600	1439280	But there should have, I, what?
1439280	1442240	I was just going to say that probably they're not going to end up getting any money out
1442240	1443240	of this.
1443240	1446320	I was just going to be agreeing that, and I think this has happened in the past with
1446320	1451400	other games that had secure ROM, where the agreement was that there is an uninstall program,
1451400	1455280	but you have to get it from secure ROM to uninstall the game.
1455280	1459200	But they keep changing the version, so it doesn't work, I don't think, anymore.
1459200	1462000	I know it's not easy to uninstall it.
1462000	1469440	I think that there should have been something in the manual, or maybe just like a little
1469440	1474240	icon on the box that, you know, has like some sort of secure ROM logo on it or something.
1474240	1476320	Something that, you know.
1476320	1478000	I happen to have the box right here.
1478000	1481120	Dude, I'm sorry, I just have to interrupt with something hilarious.
1481120	1482720	Please, that's why you're here.
1482720	1488080	I was just, like, I was reading an article about how You-Know-Who was disbarred, and
1488080	1494160	somebody made a cake and wrote, Dear You-Know-Who, Congrats on the disbarment, you douchebag.
1494160	1497000	Hold on, you're getting to the next story, you're getting a little ahead.
1497000	1498200	That's all right.
1498200	1502540	I'm looking at the box, and I'm looking at the inside of the box.
1502540	1505720	It's a little, you know, what's all in the game.
1505720	1507200	I'm looking at the back of the box.
1507200	1510840	I'm even looking at the fine print that gives the system requirements.
1510840	1512640	Internet connection is required.
1512640	1517520	EA terms and conditions and feature updates can be found at www.ea.com.
1517520	1522040	I don't see the word secure ROM anywhere here on this box.
1522040	1524400	So they don't tell you.
1524400	1527360	I honestly, I do honestly think.
1527360	1531960	I mean, you know, the primary rule is let the buyer beware, but still, I think that
1531960	1537040	if they are going to install something without your knowledge, when you think you're getting
1537040	1540720	a game and all of a sudden you're getting, you know, this other business, even though
1540720	1546440	it's to protect their information, I honestly think that there should be some sort of warning
1546440	1551180	so that the buyer can be aware and not beware, you know what I mean?
1551180	1553600	And not have to rely strictly on Amazon reviews.
1553600	1554600	Exactly.
1554600	1559520	The other thing too, I mean, does your copy of Warhammer have secure ROM on it, because
1559520	1560520	it's also EA?
1560520	1561520	Who knows?
1561520	1562520	I don't know.
1562520	1565520	I mean, I'm looking at the box for Warhammer, which I also happen to have right here, and
1565520	1569440	I don't think I see anything on here either, but then again, would I?
1569440	1570440	Probably not.
1570440	1573920	Although I do notice a lot of the very same blah blah blah on here that I saw in the other
1573920	1574920	box.
1574920	1575920	Yeah.
1575920	1576920	I don't know.
1576920	1579280	I don't like the idea that, I mean, I don't have a problem with a program that's making
1579280	1582400	sure my copy of the game I'm running is legit.
1582400	1583920	That's fine.
1583920	1589640	But the problem is, this program also is supposed to mess up your CD burning software or something
1589640	1590640	like that.
1590640	1599100	Luckily, it hasn't with mine, because I've been able to burn DVDs quite easy with it.
1599100	1601160	You know, Jernami has a good point in our chat room.
1601160	1603080	Warhammer doesn't need secure ROM.
1603080	1609080	It is impossible to play, well, I mean, I guess never say never, but virtually impossible
1609080	1612800	to play this game without buying your own copy, because it being an MMO, you have to
1612800	1618240	have a key to go online and play the game, and it needs an internet connection by nature,
1618240	1619240	so it's very easily verifiable.
1619240	1620320	It doesn't matter.
1620320	1621320	It's a game.
1621320	1622320	It's a cop.
1622320	1624960	I mean, they do that with Final Fantasy XI.
1624960	1628800	You have to have a copy, you know, a content code or something like that to prove that
1628800	1634080	you bought the game, so I don't know.
1634080	1637520	Tigerclaw asked, did the end user license agreement state anything about copy protection?
1637520	1639120	It may not mention about secure ROM.
1639120	1641040	22 Tigerclaw said it did not.
1641040	1642040	Hmm, interesting.
1642040	1645920	Even if it did, I think they might have a claim that it's not visible enough.
1645920	1648440	You know, how many people really read those end user license agreements?
1648440	1649440	I don't know.
1649440	1650440	Who knows?
1650440	1654840	Bobby says he has, Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy before us here on All Games Radio, says the
1654840	1657680	Galactic Edition box also does not state secure ROM.
1657680	1661120	He has the special edition.
1661120	1665000	Let's see, Frisbee says people actually checked the end user license agreement and never saw
1665000	1666000	secure ROM.
1666000	1668400	Frisbee had another really good point here earlier.
1668400	1670760	I'm trying to find it.
1670760	1674760	You have to tell people when you install stuff in a PC, it's an invasion of piracy.
1674760	1678720	Tigerclaw also says this, I hope this lawsuit goes through because digital rights management
1678720	1680040	is bad enough as it is.
1680040	1683160	I wonder though, when you install the game, there's probably an end user, and that's where
1683160	1685520	that second discussion went on.
1685520	1686520	It's spyware.
1686520	1692000	It's a spyware or trojan, basically, because it's a program that's being installed without
1692000	1695360	you knowing, and that is just not right.
1695360	1700680	Do you remember years ago when CDs, I believe it was Sony, question mark, that they're
1700680	1701680	very rootkit.
1701680	1702680	That's it.
1702680	1703680	Rootkit was what it was called.
1703680	1709560	There was a big stink over that, and they had to end up either replacing disks or something,
1709560	1710560	wasn't it?
1710560	1714240	Well, they had to put an uninstall program out there for this, and people found out you
1714240	1719160	could get around this by drawing a line with a Sharpie pen on your disk to basically fuck
1719160	1722640	up the data track on your CD, because data tracks go at the end.
1722640	1724520	It's a little different, I guess.
1724520	1726360	Yeah, but here's the crazy thing about that.
1726360	1729400	I was actually reading about rootkit on Wikipedia not that long ago.
1729400	1735080	Did you know that not only could you go to the website to get the program, the Windows
1735080	1736080	official...
1736080	1739360	You know how Windows has their own spyware removal program or whatever that comes out
1739360	1740360	every month?
1740360	1742200	Sometimes you see it in Windows Update.
1742200	1747160	The rootkit removal ended up being a part of that months later, so I just always thought
1747160	1749760	that was kind of fascinating.
1749760	1755240	Very interesting, and yeah, Game Guru says it's a rootkit, and no one warned it.
1755240	1758040	I'm wondering if this is going to go along the same route.
1758040	1762200	To me, that rootkit thing kind of set a precedent in this regard.
1762200	1765440	That's where I think that, yeah, this might be justified because you're installing extra
1765440	1767440	shit that someone didn't ask for.
1767440	1768440	So...
1768440	1774760	Well, if they're going to follow by previous, because I do believe that, isn't it, once
1774760	1780440	it hits the federal level, if it's gone through court, what, at least three times, that it
1780440	1783080	becomes a basically, oh, God, I can't remember.
1783080	1785080	I took that law class a long time ago.
1785080	1786520	I'll get what you're saying, though.
1786520	1792640	But usually, if there's been a prior precedent set for it, they tend to stick by previous
1792640	1793640	rulings.
1793640	1794640	All right.
1794640	1797400	Well, if you have some thoughts on this, you can join us in our chat room, or you can always
1797400	1798400	send us an email.
1798400	1799400	Mailbagorangelawnatradio.com.
1799400	1801560	And we'll let Rob read it.
1801560	1803760	All right.
1803760	1804760	Let's move on with the news.
1804760	1809320	I know Tiara gave us a hint of what's to come, but please, Dark Soccer, give us the wonderful,
1809320	1810880	glorious news that happened this week.
1810880	1813960	In baking news, there's been cakes made regarding...
1813960	1814960	No.
1814960	1823600	Well, as stated by Sauce earlier, we have no more of he-who-shall-not-be-named practicing
1823600	1824600	law.
1824600	1829320	He has been permanently disbarred, and he's already throwing a hissy fit.
1829320	1835720	And going, wah, over the whole thing.
1835720	1841160	He's basically saying that it's a retaliation for a book he wrote about the Florida Supreme
1841160	1856720	Court trying to get past this faith-based activism against the American entertainment
1856720	1857720	industry.
1857720	1862360	He's quoted as saying this rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal
1862360	1869960	suit with enemies this foolish Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has.
1869960	1870960	That's his statement.
1870960	1871960	I love this.
1871960	1876320	Act Deaf in Chat is suggesting that we shall change the name from he-who-shall-not-be-named
1876320	1879560	to he-who-shall-not-practice law.
1879560	1880680	I endorse this.
1880680	1882320	I endorse it as well.
1882320	1883320	Loki?
1883320	1884320	I'm fine with that.
1884320	1885320	All right.
1885320	1886320	There it is.
1886320	1887320	His new name is...
1887320	1888320	I just hope we don't have to talk to him anymore.
1888320	1889320	He-who-shall-not-practice law.
1889320	1892040	I know it is getting a little old, isn't it?
1892040	1893040	Yeah.
1893040	1894040	It's already been.
1894040	1897040	It was a little old a long time ago.
1897040	1901680	Just though, and this is what I was saying when Bobby made his call to us earlier, is,
1901680	1908280	I mean, keep in mind, this is the same guy who went after Two Life Crew back in the day,
1908280	1914200	went after Ice-T for his cop-killer thing, and basically, as far as I'm concerned, this
1914200	1916040	man is anti-First Amendment.
1916040	1920280	You know what he needs to refocus his efforts on?
1920280	1926000	Like reality TV shows that appear on MTV, like The Real World and The Hills, those need
1926000	1928400	to be taken off TV.
1928400	1932560	Even more, though, going back to what I was trying to say about, I don't think he's specifically
1932560	1934400	anti-First Amendment.
1934400	1940760	He's pro-First Amendment as long as it's whatever he wants to say, you know?
1940760	1945800	As long as it's his personal agenda, which actually, I don't even know so much that it's
1945800	1950080	his own personal agenda as much as it's something that he found out that he can make money on.
1950080	1954400	In other words, it's kind of like, here, and here's a visual for you, Justin TV folks.
1954400	1961680	Here's he who shall not practice law, and here's the world revolving around him in his
1961680	1962680	mind.
1962680	1963680	Exactly.
1963680	1970600	I'm actually, like I was saying earlier, I think this is a long time coming ever since,
1970600	1972800	you know, the late 80s.
1972800	1977360	God, what is this now, 20 years this has been coming?
1977360	1984840	I'm finally glad to see, you know, basically the duct tape thrown over his mouth and, you
1984840	1989600	know, hopefully he'll stop bitching and realize that no one really cares.
1989600	1990600	Maybe he'll take up knitting.
1990600	1991600	Huh?
1991600	1992600	We'll see.
1992600	1993600	I said maybe he'll take up knitting.
1993600	1994600	We'll see.
1994600	2003640	He'd be, you know, knitting, I guess, restraints for people that he thinks offends him or something.
2003640	2007840	The ex Jason XV says, Dark Sakura, people need to learn to be offended.
2007840	2009680	Exactly.
2009680	2010680	Including this guy.
2010680	2014000	I suppose this is the biggest offense ever, huh?
2014000	2022400	He's like, the Florida people don't like me because I wrote a mean book about them.
2022400	2028120	No, they disbarred you because you're a big fucking moron.
2028120	2029120	The end.
2029120	2030880	Well, you know what?
2030880	2032560	I know it's a little early.
2032560	2036820	We usually don't get to this segment this early in the show, but you know, usually whenever
2036820	2042320	we bring up a story about he who shall not practice law on this program, it's immediately
2042320	2045440	followed by a very regular segment of ours.
2045440	2051520	One last time, seeing as hopefully, hopefully we'll never have a story about this guy again,
2051520	2071600	for real real, one more time, the FUs of the week, as inspired by a story about this guy.
2071600	2078960	I have a multiple part FU, and it begins with a certain event that occurred on Tuesday.
2078960	2085680	On Tuesday, I was driving school, mining my own and paying attention to the road and then
2085680	2087840	crash.
2087840	2094760	The silver Lancer of love is now the totaled out silver Lancer of death.
2094760	2095760	It is gone.
2095760	2096760	R.I.P.
2096760	2097760	Lancer.
2097760	2098760	My baby.
2098760	2099760	My poor, poor baby.
2099760	2105000	Um, however, um, yeah, and I did actually end up hurting my hip kind of bad.
2105000	2108320	I've been kind of limping about, um, but I'm going to see my craft director next week,
2108320	2109960	which is Poppy.
2109960	2118840	And then as my week progresses, Dan ends up going into the hospital for, I had to spend
2118840	2125480	like what, three, four hours in the ER with Dan with his knee being sprained.
2125480	2131600	So it just, it was just sort of one thing after another, but everything was happy when
2131600	2134160	I went to the airport and picked up sauce.
2134160	2140080	It's been great, except for this morning when I had to spend four hours, the car dealership
2140080	2144280	signing papers and it was the signing papers part that took longer than the test driving
2144280	2145280	part.
2145280	2153580	However, I now have, um, a happy, um, Toyota vibe as in matrix with a Pontiac exterior.
2153580	2155480	Now the big question is what are you going to name it?
2155480	2157360	Cause your last car was Vic Viper, right?
2157360	2162640	Well, my last car, piano last car wasn't Vic Viper and the one before that was the Twendy.
2162640	2164000	So what's this one going to be now?
2164000	2169320	Whatever the ship in our type is, Dan suggested that it should be Raider.
2169320	2176480	That way she would have a Toyota or Pontiac vibrator.
2176480	2178160	I get it.
2178160	2182480	Maybe that'll be it's, it's a, it's secrets, but I'm, it's not Lord British cause it's
2182480	2183480	not red.
2183480	2185520	Dan pointed that out to me cause I was going to name it Lord British.
2185520	2186520	Nice.
2186520	2192380	You know, one letter, if you named it ribbon, it'd be one letter away from Vib ribbon.
2192380	2196300	All right, you shouldn't name it.
2196300	2202380	I know what, what was, um, I'll name it, um, Mojib ribbon cause my car is kind of beige
2202380	2206640	and all of Mojib ribbon was parchment colored.
2206640	2207640	I don't know.
2207640	2209600	I like, it's the trans vibrator.
2209600	2210600	There we go.
2210600	2211600	Thank you.
2211600	2212600	Act of death.
2212600	2213600	It's the chance.
2213600	2214600	The trans vibrator.
2214600	2216400	My car's name is rez.
2216400	2217400	Your car's name is rez.
2217400	2218400	My car's name is rez.
2218400	2219400	All right.
2219400	2223520	That's the second thing Act F's contributed tonight.
2223520	2224800	That's pretty big.
2224800	2225800	Two pretty big deals.
2225800	2226840	Add it on the Wiki.
2226840	2227840	My car has a name.
2227840	2228840	All right.
2228840	2229840	There you go.
2229840	2238400	Uh, Loki, your FUs of the week, uh, my FU week goes to, uh, your aunt and, um, they're
2238400	2239400	annoying.
2239400	2240400	Hey, what did my aunt do to you?
2240400	2242760	She's sitting in a house in the middle of Elk Grove somewhere.
2242760	2243760	Just tend into the pigs.
2243760	2247920	Hey, well that aunt's fine, but the other hundred that you have underneath this floor
2247920	2249720	here that kind of sucked.
2249720	2254520	I put the food or I should say the trash next to the mixing board.
2254520	2259520	So if the sound starts to go out and we notice a big hoard of ants, we'll know why.
2259520	2260520	All right.
2260520	2267600	Uh, my FU of the week goes to my gallbladder because it sucks and it's like, I don't like
2267600	2268600	you Rob.
2268600	2273960	I'm going to get all inflaming and stuff inside you and you're going to have to have a surgery
2273960	2274960	to take me out.
2274960	2275960	Thankfully.
2275960	2276960	Gallbladder surgery is no big deal.
2276960	2279760	I've had plenty of people reassure me it's not a big deal.
2279760	2284960	It's just, you know, just the method of it all and having to get all the pre screenings
2284960	2289520	and having to go through, I'm going to be in bed for two weeks, which is going to suck
2289520	2293600	because I won't be able to do the show among other things, but I should be able to get
2293600	2297080	a whole lot of DS playing in at that time because you'll notice I haven't reviewed a
2297080	2301480	DS game on this program in like six months, so that's going to be the blessing about gallbladder
2301480	2304640	surgery is dammit, I'm going to catch up on every single handheld game I've been waiting
2304640	2307780	to catch up on in a long freaking time.
2307780	2312520	So if you do the gallbladder for hating me, sadly enough, Rob's gallbladder is easier
2312520	2314760	to remove and secure off.
2314760	2319960	You've been sitting here all night long with that punchline, haven't you?
2319960	2321960	You've been waiting just the last minute.
2321960	2322960	Asshole.
2322960	2323960	All right.
2323960	2326400	Tara, do you have any FUs of the week?
2326400	2330840	I would just like to say to Drew that you suck for not coming to my brunch yesterday.
2330840	2335560	So FU, Drew, for ruining my vacation by being a loser and not showing up.
2335560	2336560	Aww.
2336560	2337560	How sad.
2337560	2338560	All right.
2338560	2345120	There you go, FUs of the week.
2345120	2348400	Nate432 says, Rob, you need to give the PSP some more love.
2348400	2351000	I do love the PSP, and you know I'm going to love it a whole lot more when it's the
2351000	2353440	only way I can watch movies for a couple weeks.
2353440	2357920	So hey, PSP is the perfect post-surgery device.
2357920	2358920	There you go.
2358920	2359920	How's that?
2359920	2360920	Fantastic.
2360920	2362280	New games all in one.
2362280	2364280	There's your PSP love.
2364280	2365280	All right.
2365280	2366280	All right.
2366280	2370360	Securom is the new Gator, says Jirnami.
2370360	2371360	Remember Gator?
2371360	2372360	Yeah, I remember Gator.
2372360	2373360	Good stuff.
2373360	2374360	Gator sucked.
2374360	2375360	Gator doesn't.
2375360	2376360	What ever happened to Gator?
2376360	2377360	It's probably still around.
2377360	2378600	I'm going to look that up on Wikipedia right now.
2378600	2379600	All right.
2379600	2380600	Meanwhile, another story.
2380600	2387800	Meanwhile, tomorrow or today or whenever you're having a listen to this, Monday, September
2387800	2395600	29th, Xbox Live Arcade will be, or Xbox Live completely, will be down the entire day.
2395600	2406880	24 hours so that they can do some necessary improvements to prep for the next Xbox experience,
2406880	2413640	or new Xbox experience, with all the fancy avatars and other crap that they're adding
2413640	2414640	to it.
2414640	2419280	So that's not the day that it's coming out, but it will be the day that they're working
2419280	2420280	on stuff.
2420280	2426720	So you'll have to find some offline games to play during that time.
2426720	2428960	Wow.
2428960	2431760	This is crazy that Gator got brought up tonight.
2431760	2433720	There's actually some very recent news about Gator.
2433720	2435080	I'm reading here on Wikipedia.
2435080	2436080	Okay.
2436080	2439760	Gator was run by a company called the Claria Corporation, was the people behind Gator.
2439760	2441400	And there was a whole lot of back and forth.
2441400	2442640	You know, there was that Gator.
2442640	2445680	And to make a long story short, Gator was like some freaking program that installed
2445680	2448920	itself on your computer, basically, that would just pop ads up all over.
2448920	2452080	Like wasn't that stupid weather bug thing part of this?
2452080	2455680	Like they would try to give you some dumb little program that would sneak Gator on there
2455680	2456680	as part of it.
2456680	2457920	Well, yeah, that was it.
2457920	2461200	It was no weather scope, precision time.
2461200	2462200	That was it.
2462200	2464520	Is the time on your computer accurate?
2464520	2466840	That was their big thing.
2466840	2467840	Okay.
2467840	2469080	Well, here's the thing.
2469080	2471480	You know, there was this all back and forth stuff.
2471480	2476640	In 2006, Claria said they were going to exit the adware business and focus on search technology.
2476640	2478120	Well, here's the thing.
2478120	2485080	September 26, 2008, two days ago, Jelly Cloud, which is what Claria changed its name to in
2485080	2490880	June, has laid off all its employees, shut down all operations, and has liquidated all
2490880	2491880	assets.
2491880	2494960	So, Gator officially bid it this week.
2494960	2499160	How do you like that for like late breaking news?
2499160	2503040	And I would have never known if we didn't joke about it on tonight's show.
2503040	2504760	So Xbox Live down for a full day, really?
2504760	2505760	Yeah.
2505760	2508240	I had to make the preparations last week.
2508240	2515300	So we're ready to go back to playing System Link Saints Row 1.
2515300	2517520	That's what we're going to do on Monday.
2517520	2520480	I have to go a full day without Rock Band?
2520480	2522200	What am I going to do?
2522200	2523200	I'm just kidding.
2523200	2526120	Is Xbox Live going down a whole day really that big a deal?
2526120	2527120	I don't think so.
2527120	2529840	It won't be the end of the world.
2529840	2534080	It is a big deal if you happen to, I don't know, have a new system that requires you
2534080	2541240	to be logged into Xbox Live so that it knows that you purchased certain things.
2541240	2545400	Otherwise they show up as demos or just don't work.
2545400	2553760	Oh yeah, that'll be bad for those folks that haven't done the resetting of their licenses
2553760	2554760	and all that stuff.
2554760	2556280	Yeah, let's play more Mercenaries 2.
2556280	2557280	All right.
2557280	2558760	And watch Heroes.
2558760	2563440	You know, one thing that also can happen when Xbox Live is down is that your games can patch.
2563440	2568860	And I don't know if you guys have heard about this, but Fable 2 is coming out very soon.
2568860	2574160	And Fable 2 is actually going to be having no co-op the day it launches, which is kind
2574160	2575160	of interesting.
2575160	2576560	They're going to have to patch it into the game.
2576560	2580120	They say they're going to do it a week after the release, but it's actually not going to
2580120	2581120	be in the game.
2581120	2584340	And for those of you guys that listen to Bobby Black Wolf Show, who he's on right before
2584340	2588040	us on AllGames.com, we actually talked about this at length in the Tossover segment at
2588040	2589960	the end of his show this week.
2589960	2595240	But in a nutshell, one thing I suggested is that reviewers should simply not review the
2595240	2598960	co-op part of the game because it's not a part of the game at its release.
2598960	2603000	But it's a very tricky area right now because there really is no kind of ethical standard
2603000	2606440	set as to what should and should not be in the game when it's released.
2606440	2609400	MMOs, they're always constantly patching.
2609400	2611080	Look at a game like Burnout Paradise.
2611080	2615080	Burnout Paradise has kind of reinvented itself several times since the game launched, and
2615080	2616640	that's been overall a good thing.
2616640	2619680	But at the same time, Burnout Paradise didn't advertise that motorbikes were going to be
2619680	2620880	in the game before its release.
2620880	2621880	That was kind of an added bonus.
2621880	2622880	Yes.
2622880	2623880	Loki, what do you think?
2623880	2626360	Because I think you got in late and you didn't get to give your opinion on that on Bobby
2626360	2627360	Show.
2627360	2632080	Well, I think it's just retarded that games come out nowadays and require patching out
2632080	2636000	the door or patching weeks later because they're not done.
2636000	2639200	That would be like saying, oh, hey, you know that movie that came out?
2639200	2640840	You're going to go to theaters and see it?
2640840	2642880	Yeah, we're going to patch in the ending later.
2642880	2648880	I mean, it's just getting to the point now where developers don't need to finish their
2648880	2652720	product before it hits the market because they want to get it out at a certain time.
2652720	2656200	Well, you know, if you want to get it at a certain time, maybe you should have worked
2656200	2657200	harder.
2657200	2658800	Well, here's a thought.
2658800	2662800	If they had never teased this as being an element of the game, I...
2662800	2665280	It would have looked really awesome.
2665280	2668240	It would have looked really awesome when it finally came out.
2668240	2673200	So in a way, I think the lesson to be learned here is don't tempt us with things that you're
2673200	2676400	not going to be able to, because this is the kind of stories that are going to happen,
2676400	2677400	you know?
2677400	2678720	Otherwise, people would have been none the wiser.
2678720	2682080	I bet you there still would have been a lot of anticipation over Fable 2 because, you
2682080	2685400	know, Fable did have its fans on Xbox One, you know?
2685400	2688520	So just kind of a lesson to be learned, I suppose.
2688520	2692360	But still, at least they are patching it that soon.
2692360	2694360	At least it's not coming like a year later.
2694360	2695360	We hope.
2695360	2696360	This is in theory.
2696360	2697360	Yeah.
2697360	2702120	I mean, there are a lot of games that are put out by certain companies like EA that
2702120	2707320	come out flawed and patches don't come that quick at all.
2707320	2712560	And I find it hard to believe that, oops, we just didn't catch some of these bugs, Mercenaries
2712560	2714880	2.
2714880	2717440	It's just... it's lazy.
2717440	2718440	It really is.
2718440	2719960	Let's cut costs with QA.
2719960	2720960	How about that?
2720960	2721960	All right.
2721960	2724880	Well, unfortunately, because online co-op is not in the game when it launches, some
2724880	2728280	of the achievements might be a little harder to get, which is also very interesting about
2728280	2729800	the achievements in Fable 2.
2729800	2734980	Most of them you can either do yourself or watch someone else do, and it will unlock
2734980	2735980	the achievement.
2735980	2740240	For example, there's an achievement worth 10 points in the game called the romantic.
2740240	2746020	Take a villager on a perfect date or tag along to one, meaning that it looks like most achievements
2746020	2750520	will be obtainable in co-op modes as well, which is kind of interesting because, you
2750520	2753980	know, is that part of the programming where I guess once the trigger's hit, it's hit no
2753980	2758680	matter who did it, or was that something that was always intended to try and get more people
2758680	2763300	to play the game together or whatever?
2763300	2764960	Kind of interesting, I suppose.
2764960	2768120	It'll make it a little easier to actually get all the achievements, and it should be
2768120	2774320	noted, not all of them can you do with another person as well, but a good chunk of them can
2774320	2778400	be done co-op or single player mode, which is kind of interesting.
2778400	2784880	Fable 2, despite all the blah blah blah about the online co-op, I'll probably still get
2784880	2785880	the game when it comes out.
2785880	2786880	I actually enjoyed the first game.
2786880	2791160	I had fun with it, so I'm looking forward to the second game as well.
2791160	2792440	Quick comments from chat room.
2792440	2795240	There's quite a few comments coming in here.
2795240	2798400	Bobby Blackwell says, I've never heard of a movie being taken out of the theaters to
2798400	2800360	be given a new ending and put back in theaters.
2800360	2801360	Wait, wait, wait.
2801360	2802360	I have.
2802360	2803360	I have.
2803360	2804360	28 Days Later.
2804360	2805360	Remember?
2805360	2807920	They re-released it with like the additional ending or the special ending?
2807920	2808920	Yeah.
2808920	2809920	Sometimes they do.
2809920	2810920	I mean, you know, I get the point.
2810920	2814080	I think he's trying to say that you're doing an apples and oranges thing with that comparison,
2814080	2817920	but they do sometimes re-release movies with extra crap to try and get people to go see
2817920	2818920	it a second time.
2818920	2821360	Or completely change it all around, thank you George Lucas.
2821360	2824400	But I guess that's true.
2824400	2825400	Let's see.
2825400	2829200	Gerardo says, but are people really not going to play Fable 2 because there's no co-op in
2829200	2830200	it?
2830200	2831200	No.
2831200	2832200	I think not.
2832200	2833200	It's still Fable.
2833200	2834200	I think at the end of the day, he's right.
2834200	2835200	You're right.
2835200	2838040	Anybody that was going to buy the game is still going to buy it because they know it
2838040	2839040	is coming.
2839040	2841280	And anybody that wasn't going to buy the game is just going to throw this onto the list
2841280	2842280	of what they don't like.
2842280	2845600	Hey, at least they came out and said that the online co-op isn't in there instead of
2845600	2849680	releasing it with the online co-op and it doesn't work and then go, oops, we got to
2849680	2850680	patch it later.
2850680	2851680	True.
2851680	2852680	So.
2852680	2853680	Very true.
2853680	2854680	Yeah.
2854680	2857400	So, you know, honestly, at the end of the day, is this going to change anything about
2857400	2858400	Fable 2?
2858400	2859400	Probably not.
2859400	2860400	Probably not.
2860400	2864100	But will this maybe set a really bad precedent?
2864100	2865100	That's what we're all kind of...
2865100	2866200	I don't think so.
2866200	2868600	The precedent's already been set a long time ago.
2868600	2872960	I mean, now that we have consoles that can patch games, that doesn't mean that the game
2872960	2875480	has to come out perfect.
2875480	2879200	And not that it really mattered before that either, so.
2879200	2885020	But I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of the games that came out before the 360
2885020	2890240	and stuff like that, there weren't as many glitches and problems because they spent
2890240	2893440	more time testing them and making sure that they worked right.
2893440	2897840	And now it doesn't matter because if people discover glitches later on, eh, we'll just
2897840	2900080	go and fix it.
2900080	2903980	I think that's kind of lazy and it kind of sucks that you buy a product and it doesn't
2903980	2908840	work correctly because of sheer laziness.
2908840	2911820	Sounds like there will be a lot of people that want to call in and talk about this later.
2911820	2913440	We got to keep it moving, though.
2913440	2917960	We're getting into the show here and we got a lot of stories to still cover, like whatever
2917960	2919680	Dark Soccer's going to talk about next.
2919680	2925320	Well, it looks like, you know how people were saying that the 360 wasn't necessarily so
2925320	2930940	popular in Japan, but it looks like it's overtook the PS3, actually, again.
2930940	2941340	With the recent price cut, it went down, it actually managed to get out 13,777 units as
2941340	2945520	opposed to PS3's 8,156.
2945520	2949880	So it's seriously giving it the smackdown.
2949880	2957680	However, in software titles, it's still basically in Nintendo's pocket.
2957680	2962680	For software, Pokemon Platinum is the top seller, then Dragon Ball Origins, Rythmton
2962680	2970960	Goku Gold, and yeah, the top three are all DS games, followed by Trusty Bell's Chopin's
2970960	2975160	Dream on PS3, the reprise.
2975160	2981880	So Microsoft really needs to be praising whatever deity they believe in for Tales of Vesperia
2981880	2983040	right about now, right?
2983040	2984040	Pretty much.
2984040	2989080	Well, following down even the next two games after that are more Nintendo games, Quiz Magic
2989080	2993280	Academy DS and Wii Fit are 5 and 6, respectively.
2993280	3001020	7 is a Katekyo Hitman Reborn Battle Arena on PSP, 8 is with Samurai Portable PSP, 9
3001020	3004440	One Piece Unlimited Cruise on Wii, and then Mario Kart Wii.
3004440	3012880	So it's very much dominated by Nintendo, but as far as hardware sales, number one is the
3012880	3019300	DS, 2 is the Wii, 3 is PSP, 4 is Xbox 360, 5 is PS3, and 6 is PS2, which is actually
3019300	3024800	still impressive, selling over 7,000 units.
3024800	3028040	Interesting comment from chat, and I apologize in advance for horribly mispronouncing your
3028040	3029760	name, which I'm sure I'm going to do.
3029760	3035600	Nefestus says, I love the fact that 360 outselling PS3 in Japan for a week is news.
3035600	3037440	It kind of is, in a way.
3037440	3043000	I mean, it really is that, wow, the 360, because a lot of folks say, oh, Xbox is failing in
3043000	3046800	Japan, Microsoft is failing, they don't know what they're doing, da da da, or that it's
3046800	3047800	never going to sell in Japan.
3047800	3052800	And then finally, it takes one really, really good game for that audience to really start
3052800	3053800	moving these systems.
3053800	3059380	And it is, the turnaround is somewhat, it's somewhat notable.
3059380	3063460	This is, the question is, will it have momentum, or is this just going to be a one hit, one
3063460	3064460	trick pony?
3064460	3071160	Well, still though, I mean, that's more than twice as many units that went out, so.
3071160	3078720	I want to say that perhaps if, you know, if basically, it does have to do with Squeenix
3078720	3086540	support, if I think that they might put the effort into trying to get more of those major
3086540	3090700	party developers, at least for the Japanese market, to try to get more things on their
3090700	3094600	systems, you know, that might help them out in the long run if they can keep that kind
3094600	3095600	of support.
3095600	3100240	Yeah, if only they can, I think they need to throw a lot of money at Capcom to get the
3100240	3105640	next, like, another Monster Hunter game, exclusive for the 360, that'll sell plenty of systems.
3105640	3108080	Or Fire Emblem.
3108080	3110800	Fire Emblem will never be on that system.
3110800	3114120	I mean, not Fire Emblem, yep.
3114120	3115120	Because that's a Nintendo title.
3115120	3116120	I don't know what I was thinking.
3116120	3117120	Actually, what you were saying, so.
3117120	3118120	Let's get the name mixed up.
3118120	3119120	Alright.
3119120	3120120	Alright, let's move on.
3120120	3131280	Let's see here, this week there was an interesting countdown done by Bungie on the anniversary
3131280	3139360	of Halo 3, and kind of went back to the whole E3 announcement, or that never really happened,
3139360	3147920	and what we got after the countdown was done is a teaser for a Halo 3 campaign expansion.
3147920	3155160	And we know this because on Xbox Live, the description for the video that's on there
3155160	3159840	is a new Halo 3 campaign experience.
3159840	3165160	But what exactly this experience will be, who knows.
3165160	3170720	The thoughts are it's not going to be Master Chief as the main character, and actually
3170720	3175280	they have a whole bunch of breakdown on the trailer and stuff.
3175280	3181280	I know on Xbox, was it on 360, Fanboy, they had a pretty cool video breakdown there.
3181280	3183760	Obsessive fans analyzing each and every frame.
3183760	3184760	I know.
3184760	3185760	Awesome.
3185760	3188680	And then of course, along with analyzing every single frame, they thought that they found
3188680	3195600	a date within the movie itself, and of course it was January 6, 09, which would be a Tuesday.
3195600	3201680	So this might be possibly coming in January, I guess we'll have to see, but that's kind
3201680	3202680	of exciting.
3202680	3207240	At least they're going to be expanding the game some, in case it's gotten a little stale.
3207240	3209280	Free expansion, hopefully?
3209280	3215560	I don't think so, but I think this is actually kind of like the night, not the nights of
3215560	3219120	the game, but like Shivering Isles or something like that, something of that size, because
3219120	3220760	it's a whole new portion of the game.
3220760	3224040	That's kind of neat to see something like that in a non-RPG type game, though.
3224040	3228200	So it's kind of neat to see the extended life of the game, but something that should have
3228200	3230840	been there to begin with, maybe?
3230840	3231840	I don't think so.
3231840	3234480	Because we were talking about things that come out long after the game's out.
3234480	3237360	No, I don't think so, because this doesn't really tie in with the whole storyline of
3237360	3241920	Halo 3, it's kind of something on top of it that's running in the Halo engine now.
3241920	3246800	And that maybe is a little bit of backstory in-between Halo 2 and 3 or something?
3246800	3247800	I don't know.
3247800	3253200	To be honest, I've played Halo 2 a little bit, and Halo 1 multiplayer a little bit,
3253200	3256480	but I never really actually played through the storylines of those.
3256480	3261240	So I couldn't really tell you what the hell was going on in the trailers, but it looked
3261240	3262240	cool.
3262240	3267640	And it's interesting, I mean this will probably mean a lot more to a Halo fan.
3267640	3271640	Alright well moving on in other kind of Halo related news, you might remember a few weeks
3271640	3274640	ago Ensemble was shut down by Microsoft.
3274640	3278400	They actually closed down Ensemble Studios, which was very sad for those people working
3278400	3279400	there.
3279400	3283240	Well now it's come to light, and for fans of Halo, they might be sad to learn that one
3283240	3285840	of the things that Ensemble was working on, in fact probably the biggest thing they were
3285840	3288800	working on, was a Halo MMO.
3288800	3294180	They were working on a MMO centered in the Halo universe, and apparently even some pictures
3294180	3297440	have surfaced from what the Halo MMO was supposed to look like.
3297440	3300520	And it kind of looked like, wow, in the Halo universe.
3300520	3304720	It's kind of interesting, it looked to be kind of simple like World of Warcraft is.
3304720	3309060	Very similar layout for those that play Warcraft, or even Warhammer Online, actually the interface
3309060	3310960	almost looks more like Warhammer Online to me.
3310960	3316080	Kind of the way it is, you can see characters wheeling dual swords, as well as guns and
3316080	3317080	all that stuff.
3317080	3323760	So kind of sad that this project won't see the light of day, but I guess then again if
3323760	3326960	the game wasn't very good, then maybe it's a good thing it doesn't see the light of day,
3326960	3330960	because Halo is a franchise you don't want to put out a bad game under.
3330960	3334760	Although say what you will about Halo 3, although I don't think Halo 3 is necessarily bad,
3334760	3338160	it's just people wanted a little more out of it I suppose.
3338160	3342760	So apparently though, keep in mind there are still plenty of other Halo projects in development,
3342760	3345600	so sadly this MMO will not be one of them.
3345600	3350680	But you never know, sometimes these things get completely redone somewhere else, you
3350680	3351720	know what I mean?
3351720	3355920	Like for instance Star Trek Online, look at that, a particular studio is making that,
3355920	3360160	they kind of shut down, another company picked it up and is now going to be releasing it.
3360160	3363360	So who knows?
3363360	3364840	We'll see.
3364840	3368680	Holy Shonen in chat puts it very simply, he says, I'm going to miss Ensemble.
3368680	3374240	Oh sorry, sorry to pour salt in the wound there about the, it's very interesting too,
3374240	3378840	you don't often hear about what these studios are necessarily working on, the secret projects,
3378840	3380480	when these studios are closed.
3380480	3384280	So it's kind of neat that we got to hear a little something about it.
3384280	3388880	Going forward into our release date so that we can hear about things that are coming out,
3388880	3391360	and some things that were cancelled.
3391360	3398520	And for the UK we have on the 30th Cell Zenith coming out on PC, and then we have a few things
3398520	3403840	for the 1st through the 3rd on the 1st, Mega Man 9 on Xbox 360, so you can go download
3403840	3406440	that and it's super fun.
3406440	3411880	On the 3rd there's Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway on PC, Dancing Stage Supernova 2,
3411880	3420560	Civilization 2, FIFA 09 on damn near everything, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations
3420560	3424560	on DS after that, so.
3424560	3431760	Cool, let's see, this week there is quite a bit coming out, not a lot of it's good,
3431760	3436880	a lot of PC games, holy shit there's a lot of PC games.
3436880	3441680	Anyways, for console stuff, we've got a re-release of some Mortal Kombat games in the Mortal
3441680	3446640	Kombat collection, they'll be available on PS2.
3446640	3452560	Also coming to the DS, Animal Paradise, yet another animal raising sim, hooray.
3452560	3458880	Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, the Sonic DS made by Bioware, coming to the DS.
3458880	3467000	And also Silent Hill Homecoming, coming to the PC, 360 and PS3 this week, pretty awesome.
3467000	3475000	Hype Mania, coming out on Wii, 360 and PC, I guess on the 360 maybe that's an Xbox Live
3475000	3484280	Arcade game, I haven't heard that one, let's see here, there's a lot of games that I don't
3484280	3489720	think are coming out, I'm not going off this list.
3489720	3494120	Let's see, what else is coming out this week, I don't think there's a lot of other big titles,
3494120	3497880	some miscellaneous DS games, Unsolved Crimes on the DS, which I actually played that a
3497880	3505800	little bit as kind of an adventure game from Atari there, you solve crimes, not really
3505800	3509820	like Ace Attorney or anything like that, but it's pretty cool.
3509820	3514440	And DT Carnage on PSP, it's a car combat game.
3514440	3526080	PC, let's see we've got a bunch of games coming out, some of the highlights though, let's
3526080	3535400	see here, let me read this chat comment really quick because it's funny, I load for real.
3535400	3540940	Act Def says Silent Hill got a 6.5 by IGN I think, it makes a little annoyed face.
3540940	3545960	Frisbee says IGN gets a 6.5 sometimes, nice.
3545960	3550120	Supposedly I guess on PC, and I thought this already came out already, but it says Limbo
3550120	3556620	of the Lost is coming, and if you remember that god awful song they made, you guys listened
3556620	3560840	to a little bit ago, yeah that was from that game.
3560840	3575600	And lastly, let's see here, Sue Tycoon 2 Ultimate for PC, We Cheer on the Wii, and let's see
3575600	3582040	here, lastly Harvest Moon, Tree of Tranquility on the Wii.
3582040	3585160	Goodie, more Harvest Moon, yay.
3585160	3590280	Alright, is that it, alright, let's move over to Japan where it's kind of a slower week,
3590280	3594600	there's not a whole lot of new stuff coming out, but there is Raiden 4 coming out on the
3594600	3598420	Xbox 360, so if you like your Raiden games, there's a brand new one, I didn't even know
3598420	3601940	there was one in development, there you go, coming out on the 360.
3601940	3605720	Moving over to the Playstation 3, not a lot of new stuff, but you do get some price reductions
3605720	3610520	on Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion and Warhawk are moving into the best series, as well as, hey
3610520	3615120	if you need it, a new Dust Guard filter coming out in black and white, Dust Guard Filter
3615120	3616120	3.
3616120	3617320	Dust Guard Filter 3?
3617320	3618900	Yes, comes out this week.
3618900	3620480	It's not Dust Cap 3?
3620480	3623240	No, now it's Dust Guard Filter because it's a Playstation 3.
3623240	3624680	Ah, Dust Guard Filter.
3624680	3625840	There you have it.
3625840	3632200	On the Nintendo Wii, Jikyu Powerful Major League 3 is the only new game coming out this
3632200	3636720	week, it's a new game from Konami, comes out this week on the Nintendo Wii, so let's see
3636720	3638440	if there's anything on the Playstation 2.
3638440	3644160	There are some things on the Playstation 2, including Kanuchi Shiroki Tsubasa no Shuu
3644160	3649120	coming regular and limited edition, that same Powerful Major League game also is coming
3649120	3654640	out on the Playstation 2 as well, and the Magician's Academy comes out on Playstation
3654640	3656360	2 in Japan this week.
3656360	3663320	Moving on over to the handhelds, looking at the Nintendo DS, Unknown Soldier Mokuba no
3663320	3671000	Hoku comes out this week in Japan, as well as Nakamura Sumikko Tettai Shidou Shintoic
3671000	3676200	Test One High One Fun DS Lesson from the Rocket Company.
3676200	3678960	I'm trying to figure out what exactly is the lesson that will be learned in this game.
3678960	3682040	Let's see, it looks like it might be writing of some sort.
3682040	3683040	Oh, it's English!
3683040	3685880	It's English, learning English.
3685880	3686880	Huh.
3686880	3693080	So, probably not a game any of our listeners need if you're listening to this program.
3693080	3697460	And let's check out the PSP real quick.
3697460	3698700	Not a whole lot.
3698700	3701000	Looks like there's about three new games here.
3701000	3710120	To Love, Roo Trouble, Doki Doki, Rinkai Gakuhen comes out on the PSP, as well as Ikitosan,
3710120	3713640	Eloquent Fist comes out, regular and limited edition.
3713640	3719000	To make a correction to the comment in the chat room that we had, Silent Hill Homecoming
3719000	3725040	hasn't been rated or reviewed by IGN yet.
3725040	3731960	They do have one press rating, which is from, that is a 6.5, that's from the official Xbox
3731960	3732960	magazine.
3732960	3737560	So, all your hate needs to be directed to the official Xbox magazine at this time.
3737560	3741000	IGN, you can hate on it a little bit later.
3741000	3744360	Alright, that's it for Japanese release dates.
3744360	3747200	Well, how about more news?
3747200	3750160	Cause no good news is good good news?
3750160	3751160	Okay.
3751160	3752160	How about it?
3752160	3760520	Well, um, Hideo Kojima is the hero of many, many a gamer for giving us the Metal Gear
3760520	3761520	franchise.
3761520	3768760	And he's saying that he's got ideas for Metal Gear Solid 5, 3 concepts, but he doesn't want
3768760	3773200	anyone to use them because that means he has to get involved and he doesn't wanna.
3773200	3779200	He said he was gonna be stepping back out of Metal Gear Solid the whole series, but
3779200	3785440	honestly I think that he should have some involvement with it.
3785440	3787080	It was his story from the beginning.
3787080	3791200	I don't think that starting a story and leaving it in the hands of other people, especially
3791200	3798040	if you've controlled it so far, you know, it could, well I mean, it could probably have
3798040	3804400	less of a bizarre ending than Metal Gear Solid 4 had, maybe, but I don't know, I liked his
3804400	3805400	weird storytelling.
3805400	3810520	Well, I can tell you what one of his ideas were for the new Metal Gear Solid game and
3810520	3814440	I'll give you a little bit of a vague idea here.
3814440	3822080	Basically, a couple of snakes, cronies, you know, will be coming to visit him.
3822080	3828760	Unfortunately, when they arrive there, they will figure out that he's dead and to which
3828760	3833440	they have to convince everyone around him that he's still alive by moving his arms and
3833440	3838160	stuff and hanging out on the beach and that kind of fun stuff.
3838160	3842160	He's not getting the weekend at Bernie's treatment.
3842160	3843480	I thought it was dead or alive.
3843480	3845800	The most dorkest thing I've ever heard.
3845800	3850320	Okay, here's the thing though, I mean, it's interesting because he might have actually
3850320	3853360	really meant it this time when he said he wasn't doing another Metal Gear game, because
3853360	3856040	doesn't he always say that, like, I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do it, no, I'm
3856040	3858920	not gonna do it, and then he always looks like he does it.
3858920	3864840	Now he's kind of like, this kind of is like, well, I don't really want to do it, but if,
3864840	3867640	you know, they wanted me to do it, I have an idea.
3867640	3874720	Well, there was some other type of experimental game that he was working on, but, I mean,
3874720	3878680	as long as he writes this- What, bulk tie?
3878680	3879800	Sorry.
3879800	3881960	I think we need a solid snake party game.
3881960	3887580	Well, he's quoted as saying that he wants to create something new and it's difficult
3887580	3893280	to explain since no one's seen it before, so he doesn't know if it will sell well.
3893280	3897960	But, I mean, there's nothing to say that he can't have some involvement on Metal Gear
3897960	3902520	Solid 5, at least as a creative director, you know, instead of being as hands-on as
3902520	3907640	he was with a lot of the other stuff, right?
3907640	3912800	Hephaestus in chat says it's like, ooh, please beg me to do it and I'll reluctantly agree.
3912800	3914960	It's kind of what this amounts to.
3914960	3915960	Nice.
3915960	3920920	Well, we'll see if he ends up coming back in a larger capacity or if he really means
3920920	3922400	it this time.
3922400	3926760	I honestly think he really means it, but he's not going to be able to resist contributing
3926760	3929280	in some way, but he's just going to probably scale back his involvement.
3929280	3930280	We'll see.
3930280	3933880	Oh, yeah, the weekend at Bernie's saying that's comedy gold, man.
3933880	3936120	It'll be awesome.
3936120	3942480	Anyways, there's something out there that you can play for free on your PS3.
3942480	3943600	That's right.
3943600	3950420	There is actually an MMO available in Japan called Angel Love Online, and it is a free-to-play
3950420	3957320	MMO, and there are instructions online to allow you to set up your own account and basically
3957320	3961520	create your own, I guess, login.
3961520	3967120	If you don't have a PlayStation Network login for Japanese PlayStation Network, then you
3967120	3973120	can create one and also help you create a login for this game.
3973120	3977600	To create your Japanese PlayStation Network login, the easiest way to do that is actually
3977600	3984040	go to a website called Japanesepsn.com, and they'll walk you through it.
3984040	3991920	As far as creating your own login for this game, you can actually go to ps3fanboy.com.
3991920	3997460	They have an article on there for that, and also neogaf.com, their forums.
3997460	3998640	There's another article.
3998640	4003320	The game itself actually looks a little bit like Ragnarok Online, kind of, except really
4003320	4005200	like chibi with a bunch of people.
4005200	4010600	Are you trying to just get Tiara and Jamie interested in this game?
4010600	4013480	Not really, but I'm just saying, hey, it's a free-to-play game.
4013480	4015540	I don't really know what the point of the game is.
4015540	4018600	There is someone riding a giant beetle, so that's kind of cool.
4018600	4024260	Oh, and there's another giant frog or something, but lots of people dressed up really weird.
4024260	4030840	Someone's in a giant cat robot thing, so yeah, I'm sure this will appeal to somebody.
4030840	4033960	I don't know what the point of this game is or purpose, because it's all in Japanese,
4033960	4035840	so ha ha, funny.
4035840	4038960	But yeah, check it out, it's free.
4038960	4043520	So free is awesome, and if it sucks, hey, you know what, at least this game looks a
4043520	4047680	little bit better than yours.
4047680	4048680	Is that going to be your new thing?
4048680	4049880	Well, at least it's better than yours.
4049880	4051520	Yes, it is better than yours.
4051520	4054200	Angel of Online.
4054200	4057320	Also better than Yaris are price drops, hooray.
4057320	4061980	And it was rumored that a big old price drop is coming for the Sony Playstation 3, but it
4061980	4066560	looks like it's actually mostly kind of contained to Blockbuster.
4066560	4069780	It looks like they appear to be unloading some extra consoles there.
4069780	4073280	This happened on Friday, and it was caught from a memo that was going around internally
4073280	4077720	within the company, is that they're dropping the price of the 40 gigabyte machines at Blockbuster
4077720	4083320	down to $360, which is about a $40 difference from what they were at.
4083320	4086120	They're just kind of trying to unload these systems and get them out, since we know there's
4086120	4089760	some new SKUs coming, probably from the Tokyo Game Show.
4089760	4094920	But just so you know, right now, it looks like it's only contained to Blockbuster, but
4094920	4097880	could this be the first little thing that starts a snowball?
4097880	4101800	Well, they already have the new SKU out right now, the 80 gigs core system is available
4101800	4106800	right now, but they are sitting on a lot of the 40 systems, and what are you going to
4106800	4107800	do with those?
4107800	4112080	I mean, they were the same price as the 80s, so now you have to drop the price to get them
4112080	4113120	out of there.
4113120	4117120	So that kind of sucks, but yeah, and I can imagine the same is going to happen with the
4117120	4120360	Metal Gear Solid bundles, if there are any left over, they're going to have to drop the
4120360	4128160	price of those, because the new 160 is coming out in like November sometime, so yeah.
4128160	4131560	And that's not surprising, but yeah, this is not the price drop you're looking for,
4131560	4135320	they're not dropping the system down $200 or anything like that, it's just clearing
4135320	4136320	them out.
4136320	4139680	Right, because you know, with all these games you usually have to install on the systems,
4139680	4143340	you probably want to get a bigger hard drive now that we're learning what it's for, and
4143340	4145760	that is installing the games on your drive basically.
4145760	4149960	Which reminds me, I need to get a bigger hard drive for the Xbox, my 20 gig drive is finally
4149960	4154560	starting to fill up to the point where I can't fit much more on it, and it's because of freaking
4154560	4155560	Rock Band.
4155560	4159360	I have been kind of clearing out old games and stuff, and I just, I have a lot of crap
4159360	4160360	on there.
4160360	4165120	You know, keep in mind, 7 of the 20 gigs gets taken up with that emulation stuff.
4165120	4169920	So I think I might finally have to cave and get, you know, a bigger drive.
4169920	4173200	Let's say, you know, hell freezes over and I want to reinstall Final Fantasy XI on my
4173200	4177000	Xbox someday, I just wouldn't be able to do it without a bigger hard drive.
4177000	4178000	We'll see.
4178000	4179000	Or get a second hard drive.
4179000	4180800	I don't know.
4180800	4182360	Can you get a 20 gig hard drive cheap?
4182360	4183360	You know, they don't even make them anymore.
4183360	4184360	Yeah, they do.
4184360	4185360	Might be able to get them used, right?
4185360	4186360	They do.
4186360	4187360	Really?
4187360	4188360	You can get them for like $59.
4188360	4189880	That's still a bit of money.
4189880	4194680	Wait, I mean, because when the 60 gig hard drives come out by themselves, you know, I'm
4194680	4196400	sure they're going to drop the price of the 20s.
4196400	4197400	True.
4197400	4202680	They just dropped the price of the 120s by like 20 bucks or so, but it's still expensive.
4202680	4209200	By the way, I was at Fry's this weekend randomly and I saw HD DVD players for 40 bucks on the
4209200	4210200	360.
4210200	4211200	Yep.
4211200	4212200	How sad.
4212200	4213200	And movies from $2.99 and up.
4213200	4214200	$2.99 and up for the HD movies.
4214200	4216480	They were still too expensive and I didn't want them.
4216480	4217480	Yeah.
4217480	4222000	You know, the $2.99 ones are usually kind of crappy things that aren't even real movies.
4222000	4225200	Usually those types of things that just show off the power of HD players like, you know,
4225200	4229960	National Geographic, you know, Discover the World and stuff, which, you know, you might
4229960	4233640	want to watch once to go ooh and aah, but that's about it, right?
4233640	4234640	So.
4234640	4235640	Anyway, sorry.
4235640	4236640	Tangent.
4236640	4237640	My bad.
4237640	4239640	Well, what is a show without tangents?
4239640	4245360	Well, here's some good news for all of our Sonic fans and hopefully it won't be like
4245360	4247560	some of the previous ones.
4247560	4255880	Um, Yuji Naka is, uh, working on, uh, uh, something with a probe, which is the new development
4255880	4256880	studio.
4256880	4261880	They have a website posted that says that it's a new experience that can be played by
4261880	4266000	penguins.
4266000	4267000	How do penguins play video games?
4267000	4271320	But it'll be something with Sega and I mean, maybe it'll be Sonic.
4271320	4272320	Maybe it'll be Outrun.
4272320	4274100	I doubt it's Sonic.
4274100	4276200	It's gotta be something new.
4276200	4278400	It's a game where you make snow cones.
4278400	4279400	Pengo!
4279400	4280400	Maybe you build igloos.
4280400	4281400	That'd be fun.
4281400	4288840	But the, the site Frostbite2008, I'll link it in the chat room, but it's got this little
4288840	4293800	flash thingy with a penguin in front of a screen.
4293800	4299000	It's actually a propre.sega.jp.
4299000	4300720	Just go look.
4300720	4304360	Hopefully this means that the game will involve penguins because that'll be cute.
4304360	4305360	I love penguins.
4305360	4308520	That's what I'm hoping for.
4308520	4313440	It looks basically like a blurred out TV, like a widescreen TV in the background and
4313440	4319960	then a penguin in front of it with the exclamation point and a question mark and a word bubble
4319960	4324120	as looking off to the side and the penguin doesn't look very confused.
4324120	4328920	He just looks flappy, but Rob likes penguins.
4328920	4329920	I love penguins.
4329920	4330920	That's what I'm hoping.
4330920	4334480	It's a whole new, I hope it is like a new version of Pengo or something.
4334480	4339400	It means, it means, it means the next Sega game will be released only on Linux.
4339400	4340400	I somehow doubt that.
4340400	4342400	I know.
4342400	4344760	It'll be written in penguin-ese.
4344760	4346320	You cannot understand it.
4346320	4349360	You have to, you have to pay for the game in fish.
4349360	4355120	All right, we'll see in a few more days when they announce it.
4355120	4362520	Something else that's going to be coming possibly soon would be the new Sonic Genesis collections,
4362520	4370040	which is supposed to be coming out on the 360 and PS3, according to some retail listings
4370040	4375400	dug up, and it says, each with ship dates of February 2009.
4375400	4377600	Hmm, what could that be?
4377600	4380480	Could that actually be coming out?
4380480	4381480	I don't know.
4381480	4382480	Retail listings.
4382480	4387000	I wouldn't have seen that either, would I?
4387000	4392360	But yeah, so, I don't know, it's probably a collection of all the Sonic games.
4392360	4398680	It's supposed to be pretty cheap, from what I hear, and I'd imagine it probably just has
4398680	4401320	like the Sonic Sega Genesis games.
4401320	4403920	Don't we already kind of have the Genesis games on Xbox Live Arcade?
4403920	4406280	Yeah, Sonic Mega Collection or something like that, you know.
4406280	4408200	Seems a little silly.
4408200	4410200	But uh, $29.99.
4410200	4411200	Again.
4411200	4413400	It's, we've seen this game a million times.
4413400	4417760	I'm grabbing like $19.99 or $29.99, so, you know, it'd be like the equivalent of buying
4417760	4420200	the Xbox Live Arcade games, probably.
4420200	4421200	It might actually be the Xbox Live Arcade games.
4421200	4424440	Do we get, I was going to say, do we get the slightly souped up versions?
4424440	4426720	I don't know.
4426720	4429000	Frisbee echoes my thoughts exactly, a Sega compilation.
4429000	4430880	That's called the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox ones.
4430880	4431880	It's like we've seen all this before.
4431880	4434080	Yeah, but the GameCube and Xbox.
4434080	4437080	So now we get achievements, wooo!
4437080	4438080	Exactly.
4438080	4439080	Wooo!
4439080	4440080	Alright.
4440080	4443940	Well, you know, Sonic is a classic though, despite the fact that they release it over
4443940	4444940	and over and over again.
4444940	4446200	It still is a classic game.
4446200	4451040	And we love to pay classic games some tribute here on this program, and that's why every
4451040	4455560	week DarkSakura likes to bring us her classic video game of the week.
4455560	4459900	So DarkSakura, please go into the Dusty Archives of Gaming and find a game that should be highlighted
4459900	4466080	this week on the program in the Classic Game of the Week segment.
4466080	4469600	Today's classic game is Mega Man 2.
4469600	4473440	And I'm saying Mega Man 2 instead of the first one because, honestly, I think Mega Man 2
4473440	4476280	is a much better game.
4476280	4485040	So if you want to roll that beautiful bean footage, Rob.
4485040	4487200	How many of us remember that noise?
4487200	4489400	This is Metal Man's music.
4489400	4495120	But basically, it's, you know, it's, okay, who in our chair room does not know Mega Man?
4495120	4497040	Do I have to really explain it?
4497040	4502840	You're a little blue robot, and you go through all these different stages, fighting off these
4502840	4507920	cute little robotic enemies, and you pick up power-ups on the way, like a big giant
4507920	4509880	Mega Man head.
4509880	4519080	Also, if you don't know who Mega Man is, he's like Bender from Futurama, totally.
4519080	4523600	At any rate, as you make it through the level, you have to fight a robot master.
4523600	4527480	Ooh, they have whips and chains and never mind.
4527480	4531400	At any rate, basically you have to fight these different robots that each have a different
4531400	4537040	ability, and the theme of their stage is, you know, goes along with whatever their ability
4537040	4538040	is.
4538040	4545160	Like Mega Man shoots out metal blades, and Bubble Man shoots out bubbles that don't do
4545160	4550320	much except for the very end of the game, where there's only three places that you use
4550320	4551720	the weapon at all.
4551720	4556920	Although there are some robots that if you do it in a certain order, some are weaker
4556920	4559280	to others.
4559280	4563600	This music here is Quick Man stage, which is like the single most annoying stage.
4563600	4567960	Unless you have fantastic timing, it's almost impossible to get past those beams that shoot
4567960	4568960	across.
4568960	4569960	Use Flash Man power.
4569960	4571280	That's right, use Flash Man power.
4571280	4573440	However Dan can do it without using Flash Man's thing.
4573440	4574440	That's insane.
4574440	4579640	I've seen him do it, I did not believe he could do it until I saw him do it.
4579640	4581600	Plus you need that Flash Man power to beat the boss.
4581600	4585040	It really helps beating the boss, because you can take like a third of his life away
4585040	4587000	instantly if you have all the Flash Man power.
4587000	4593760	Yeah, it's like I was saying earlier, each of the enemies in the game have a particular
4593760	4601360	weakness to the other boss's master's powers, except for Air Man, which you can only really
4601360	4606480	get him with the regular shot and the metal blades work on him too.
4606480	4608800	I think you're supposed to use Leaf Shield if you have it.
4608800	4609800	I think.
4609800	4610800	I might be wrong.
4610800	4612480	I always just started off with Air Man.
4612480	4614160	I either started off with Metal Man or Air Man.
4614160	4615800	Yeah, I started with Metal Man.
4615800	4619560	That person just did it, see.
4619560	4622080	You have to have impeccable timing to be able to get past this part though.
4622080	4624080	You just have to have it memorized.
4624080	4628400	We'll have to link that one in the chat room, because I was very- and they even got the
4628400	4629400	power up too.
4629400	4631400	This is the part that always got me.
4631400	4632400	Yeah.
4632400	4635800	Oh no, it was- yeah it was this one, sorry.
4635800	4643440	Anyway, I know this is really great radio, but I uh, this is actually one of my all time
4643440	4644440	favorite games.
4644440	4645960	It's up there on the list.
4645960	4651920	I even got so bored one day that I cracked the code by myself just experimenting with
4651920	4652920	it.
4652920	4657600	The password code where you put in the red blocks and blue box wherever to get past whatever
4657600	4660220	and get all of the power ups and everything.
4660220	4663880	And I wrote it on a pair of torn up blue jeans.
4663880	4666680	So I actually had it rolled up like a scroll.
4666680	4668160	Scroll and every- scroll.
4668160	4673080	Like a scroll and everything, it was my special thing to get past that.
4673080	4680240	The other cool thing about this one is that they actually had to fight to get this one
4680240	4684480	out since the first Mega Man didn't have- well Rockman I should say in Japan, didn't
4684480	4688520	really have that big of a following.
4688520	4693960	But since they put more work into the game and improved the graphics and the overall
4693960	4698840	play of it, they were able to get this out and since then it's become basically a staple
4698840	4702520	of almost anyone's classic collection.
4702520	4707000	Of course it's spawned so many sequels that we've lost count, including a couple of fighting
4707000	4716920	games, the Power Battles and a few other- there's even the whole Mega Man EXE series,
4716920	4720360	you know, we wouldn't have that without this even though I think we'd be better off without
4720360	4724080	it because I don't really care for it personally.
4724080	4729520	It also made GameSpot's greatest games of all time.
4729520	4736300	It was number 33 in Nintendo Power's top 200 Nintendo games ever list.
4736300	4738080	It also had a novelization.
4738080	4744720	They released a novel of it that- I guess it was only in the US but it was put out by
4744720	4748960	Scholastic like every other dance kid's book in the late 80s and early 90s.
4748960	4752400	Was that the same guy who did the Blaster Master books and all that stuff?
4752400	4753400	It doesn't say.
4753400	4754400	Huh.
4754400	4756520	It doesn't say.
4756520	4761920	It also had like one of the best worst cover arts ever, you know, because it had him holding
4761920	4766240	the gun and everything and had the visor, it was so stupid and ugly.
4766240	4773320	Also there was a Navi mode in the game if you got the Rockman Complete Works discs that
4773320	4779520	came out on Playstation in 1999 in Japan, which were the NES versions with the tons
4779520	4789320	of bonuses, but it also had a sort of, I guess a commentary kind of mode for playing through
4789320	4790320	the game.
4790320	4793240	It was also included in the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.
4793240	4797880	It was on PS2 and GameCube and Xbox.
4797880	4801000	So again, it's one of my favorite games.
4801000	4803800	And also this is the game that gave us Rush, remember?
4803800	4809920	You could get the platform or the jet or the other Rush thing that I forget.
4809920	4810920	What was it?
4810920	4811920	The one that wrote up walls?
4811920	4812920	Number three.
4812920	4813920	Yeah.
4813920	4814920	Yeah.
4814920	4819880	You could, and it also had the E-Tank, so you could get your full refill system and
4819880	4820880	everything.
4820880	4827800	And this is the one that I think set the stage for the releases afterwards.
4827800	4831280	And it's really the one that the Mega Man 9 is even modeled after because you don't
4831280	4835080	have the power slide or a lot of that stuff that came even in 3, you don't see that
4835080	4836080	in 9.
4836080	4840240	I mean, 9 is in some ways a direct sequel to 2, not to 8.
4840240	4842480	As far as the way it plays, it does.
4842480	4849320	But to be technical, there was actually, for 8 and 9, there was a game that came in between.
4849320	4855240	And I do want to say that it was Mega Man and Bass.
4855240	4862000	Yeah, when Mega Man and Bass came out, it was actually under development, it was titled
4862000	4864800	Rock 8.5.
4864800	4870400	So 9 is supposed to be a direct sequel, I mean an actual full sequel to 8 following
4870400	4872320	through that whole thing.
4872320	4879040	But honestly, this is the one I will sit back and go, and for a little while, I can't do
4879040	4882440	it now because of course it's been a while since I've played this game regularly, I
4882440	4886640	used to be able to do the dragon part blindfolded.
4886640	4891160	Because it is the same pattern, if you know the pattern, I mean, I would die sometimes,
4891160	4894000	but if you know the pattern, then it wasn't really all that hard because it did the same
4894000	4898000	damn thing every time.
4898000	4900760	Of course if you don't have all your- That's more impressive than being able to do the
4900760	4903280	quick man beams in my opinion.
4903280	4906680	And also if you don't know how to do, well if you don't save all your crash blocks to
4906680	4912760	that one right towards the end, then you're screwed for the whole rest of the game.
4912760	4913760	Do you know what I mean?
4913760	4916400	The one with the wall things that shoot at you.
4916400	4920000	And the thing is, I can be completely ambiguous about all the details of this game, and people
4920000	4922280	will still know what the hell I'm talking about.
4922280	4927280	Unless they're like, I guess they're 12 or something.
4927280	4933880	So that's the game, Mega Man 2, if you haven't played it, damn it, why haven't you?
4933880	4935240	And it's on Virtual Console now, right?
4935240	4938600	Yes, I know, so they need to get it now.
4938600	4941320	Although I would recommend instead of getting it on Virtual Console, just get, even though
4941320	4945280	I know people at the GameCube version of the Mega Man collection, just get the Mega Man
4945280	4946280	collection.
4946280	4948480	No, you have to have the Nintendo.
4948480	4952920	Alright, there you go, Mega Man 2, your classic game of the week.
4952920	4953920	Enjoy.
4953920	4956880	Alright, that's gonna bring part A to a close here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4956880	4959600	We're gonna take ourselves a break though, we got plenty more when we come back.
4959600	4963040	We haven't even begun to talk about some of the rumors going around about the DS.
4963040	4966160	And speaking of the Wii, we got plenty more Wii news coming up when we get back, and of
4966160	4968640	course the mailbag and your emails.
4968640	4974280	And plenty more when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio, so stay tuned.
4974280	4976200	Whoa, what is going on over there?
4976200	4977200	I dropped the microphone.
4977200	4981400	Jamie's about ready to just run out of here now that it's break time, no I'm kidding.
4981400	4990320	Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4990320	4993240	So you know this is the part of the show where we'd usually play a commercial or something
4993240	4996400	like that, but we wanted to give something extra special to those of you guys listening
4996400	4997400	tonight.
4997400	5001480	And plus the fact we haven't gotten a lot of new submissions lately for new PSAs or

5002480	5006540	So we're gonna do a giveaway tonight, and this is something extra special for you guys.

5050720	5059720	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us at Orange Lounge
5059720	5063720	Radio.
5063720	5068120	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday evening, September the 28th
5068120	5071240	of 2008, if you can believe it.
5071240	5075520	October's almost here and then pretty soon it'll be 2009.
5075520	5076520	Where does the time go?
5076520	5077520	I don't know anymore.
5077520	5078520	Alright.
5078520	5083520	Well, we've talked quite a bit about Fable 2 in the last break and that they're inserting
5083520	5085800	something in a little later after the game is released.
5085800	5086800	We talked a little bit about 360.
5086800	5090720	Now we're going to talk a little bit about the Nintendo DS and Loki's going to start
5090720	5091720	us off tonight.
5091720	5096120	Yes, there's some very interesting rumors coming out about the DS.
5096120	5103280	Actually, this is actually coming from a Japanese newspaper and it's also from their website
5103280	5106040	as well.
5106040	5111640	And there may be some revisions coming to the DS very, very soon.
5111640	5119160	Those revisions would be, of course, an added camera that will be, I guess, integrated into
5119160	5125040	the handheld itself and also the ability to play music.
5125040	5129680	And apparently one of the routes that they're going with this is, I guess, it's going to
5129680	5132440	support using SD memory cards.
5132440	5138920	So you'll be able to transfer stuff back and forth from your Wii system to your DS.
5138920	5145440	You'll be able to load songs, I guess, onto it as well through that.
5145440	5150240	And the newspaper looks like Nikkei.
5150240	5156120	They're expecting that the system be priced under 20,000 yen.
5156120	5164080	And the Nintendo DS Lite currently is priced at 16,800 yen in Japan.
5164080	5169180	And it looks like the new DS will launch first in Japan with other countries seeing an allocation
5169180	5177600	of several hundred thousand units before anybody else overseas sees them, so interesting.
5177600	5184440	And funny because this kind of goes in with the other story that's come out a couple days
5184440	5193160	ago about how Nintendo will be doing a media event on October 2nd and 3rd.
5193160	5200040	Hmm, a little interesting that this comes out in a newspaper.
5200040	5205200	I don't think that they would run rumors.
5205200	5210400	And what other announcements could we possibly expect from this media event?
5210400	5217800	Because this is, I think, their opportunity to save face from E3.
5217800	5223440	My guess, which is interesting, my guess would be of course announcing Disaster Day of Crisis
5223440	5226560	since it's already out in Japan, Europe is right around the corner.
5226560	5229520	They haven't announced the date for the US yet.
5229520	5235920	And the other thing I wouldn't be surprised if I saw was that they're publishing Conduit.
5235920	5240360	Because if you notice, for a game that doesn't have a publisher, there's sure a lot of screenshots
5240360	5246040	coming out every single day, and kind of the whole marketing campaign is in full force,
5246040	5250280	kind of makes you go, hmm, why would they be trying to market this game so strongly
5250280	5252840	right now when they don't even have a publisher yet?
5252840	5257120	Because usually the publisher is the one that does the marketing for them.
5257120	5261280	Interesting to think about that maybe this game is right around the corner, and maybe
5261280	5262640	Nintendo's publishing it.
5262640	5269280	After all, it was in Nintendo's booth at PAX, so, hmm, might be a guess.
5269280	5274360	Well hey, before the show, we, you know, and that DS is supposed to be out this year.
5274360	5278080	So that could be, you know, that's probably some of the strongest evidence as to why they
5278080	5279960	would need a special press conference to announce it.
5279960	5280960	Yeah.
5280960	5281960	It's coming out this year.
5281960	5282960	Very interesting.
5282960	5283960	What do you think?
5283960	5286200	Would you buy a DS for the camera and the music and all this stuff?
5286200	5287200	Maybe.
5287200	5288200	Maybe?
5288200	5289200	Maybe.
5289200	5290200	I have to see if it's worth it.
5290200	5291200	I expected you to say give me a flat up no.
5291200	5292200	I'm kind of surprised.
5292200	5297200	You know, but see the thing is, what other applications on the homebrew side could use
5297200	5298400	this camera and stuff?
5298400	5300520	That would be, I'd be more interested to see that.
5300520	5301840	And you just want to hack it.
5301840	5302840	Yes.
5302840	5303840	Alright.
5303840	5304840	Darcy, what do you think?
5304840	5305840	I wouldn't waste my money on it.
5305840	5308480	I already have 50 million other things that do all that.
5308480	5309480	I've got an iPhone.
5309480	5313640	I don't need anything else that takes pictures or plays music, so.
5313640	5316200	Tiara, any thoughts for you on this?
5316200	5320360	Well, like I said on Twitter, if it's not broke, don't fix it.
5320360	5324560	I already have a DS that works, so there's no reason for me to buy another one.
5324560	5328120	Speaking of Twitter, let's go over there and look at the answers to tonight's pre-show
5328120	5332600	and we do have a Twitter account at OLR, simply our Twitter name, and sometimes we ask some
5332600	5335100	questions before the show and read some of our favorite answers on the air.
5335100	5339200	We asked, would you buy the Nintendo DS again if they re-release it with the camera and
5339200	5341320	music playback abilities?
5341320	5344300	We had a lot of replies tonight, so I'm going to try to read from people we don't usually
5344300	5347680	hear from in the chat room or on Skype.
5347680	5353200	JohnnyG44 says, no, because almost everyone has a phone that can do both of those things.
5353200	5356560	I would buy a new DS with onboard memory storage though.
5356560	5360720	Crows says, I have a cell phone with two megapixels and an iPod with 30 gigabytes.
5360720	5362160	I don't need those features.
5362160	5366760	It would just make it cost like 300 bucks.
5366760	5371200	Frisbee says, no, most people have an MP3 player, a digital camera, a camera MP3 phone
5371200	5372520	and a DS already.
5372520	5375600	Why pay for all three of these all over again?
5375600	5379680	Dark Circuitry says, I don't have a DS in the first place, but I'd happily buy one if
5379680	5383760	it had those extra features, albeit at a lower price than it is now.
5383760	5388000	Decipher13 says, I'm still packing a fat, a fat, a DS fat.
5388000	5392200	I've held off on getting a light so far, but I do collect Nintendo handhelds.
5392200	5393200	I may eventually.
5393200	5394200	I like that.
5394200	5395200	I collect Nintendo handhelds.
5395200	5400640	Can you imagine though, if they did have storage, like say gig of storage space on there, how
5400640	5403080	bad that would make the Wii look?
5403080	5407600	It's like you can afford to put a gig of storage on here and yet you can't have any storage
5407600	5408600	on the Wii.
5408600	5409600	You know, five.
5409600	5410600	Very interesting.
5410600	5411600	But it has been a couple of years.
5411600	5412600	The cost of memory has maybe come down.
5412600	5413600	Let me read a couple more here.
5413600	5416640	Harry AKA says, no, I don't think I would.
5416640	5419300	And then just to show the diverse amount of responses we're getting, that's immediately
5419300	5423000	followed by Durhindermyth says, hell yes.
5423000	5427620	I'd rather have a GBA multiplayer compatibility back, but the camera would be flipping awesome.
5427620	5429480	So kind of a wide variety of answers on Twitter.
5429480	5433160	I didn't even read them all, but it's very varied in the yeses and nos there.
5433160	5434720	Thanks to everybody that replied on Twitter.
5434720	5437120	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but I try to focus on those that usually don't
5437120	5439120	join us in chat.
5439120	5440960	Very interesting, the diverse amount of responses.
5440960	5444240	I think there were enough yeses, though, that this is going to be successful if they release
5444240	5445240	it.
5445240	5448720	Well, they're not really having trouble selling yeses right now, I think, but I mean, and
5448720	5453460	they're not really, I don't think the PSP is getting there, you know, close to them
5453460	5454460	anytime soon.
5454460	5459960	I think this is obviously the compete against Apple, I mean, because now that they're becoming,
5459960	5467840	you know, the gaming portable system, I mean, that's hard to swallow, but, you know, maybe
5467840	5471160	this is the compete with them, because it's cheaper.
5471160	5472160	Possibly.
5472160	5477040	It seems kind of a long ways afterwards to, you know, to compete with PSP.
5477040	5481240	And now that we have camera functionality, I mean, how long will it be before we get,
5481240	5483080	like, gimmicky shit to go along with that?
5483080	5485080	I mean, I don't know.
5485080	5491280	Well, all right, well, you know, if they hadn't moved enough copies of the DS Lite, maybe
5491280	5495600	doing some charitable work would convince more people to get a DS, and that is just
5495600	5496600	what is happening.
5496600	5503040	So, Amazon has actually released a new version of the Nintendo DS, apparently, on their site.
5503040	5506720	It's what's called the Polar White Console, but one special difference between this and
5506720	5512000	a normal DS is that it actually has the pink breast cancer awareness ribbon, kind of like
5512000	5516900	a universal logo, if you will, right there on the DS itself.
5516900	5522720	It's going to be $129.99, which is what any other DS would cost, but Nintendo is donating
5522720	5528000	$25 from every purchase of one of these Nintendo DSes to a cancer research charity, a very
5528000	5533600	commonly heard one in breast cancer awareness circles, Susan G. Komen for the Cure.
5533600	5536760	The minimum donation promised is $100,000.
5536760	5537980	So there you go.
5537980	5541920	If you want to do a little bit of charity, feel good about your purchase, you know the
5541920	5545240	$5 goes to this Breast Cancer Awareness Foundation.
5545240	5548720	Well, you might want to hold off because, you know, there's a new DS possibly around
5548720	5549920	the corner.
5549920	5552880	And hey, you know what, if you want to make that contribution, you can go ahead and do
5552880	5553880	that on your own.
5553880	5556240	You don't need another large company to do that for you.
5556240	5560840	I have to be honest, I actually kind of agree with Loki here, as much as I appreciate what
5560840	5566120	Nintendo is trying to do here, I don't see myself going out and buying another DS just
5566120	5569600	for this when I could donate $20 myself.
5569600	5570600	You know what I mean?
5570600	5571600	Yeah.
5571600	5572600	I don't know.
5572600	5576180	And here's, I'm going to ask a question I think is out there, but some people might
5576180	5577700	be too afraid to ask, okay?
5577700	5579720	I'm going to put it out there.
5579720	5584960	Is this Nintendo, is this another way that Nintendo is trying to get women?
5584960	5591880	I mean, you know, I hate to say it's a marketing ploy, but in a way, look at what they've been
5591880	5596000	advertising lately, Carrie Underwood, pink DS's.
5596000	5600280	Is this a way for them to try and attract women to the Nintendo DS?
5600280	5607760	I would totally date Nintendo DS if he got a better job and could prove that he's into
5607760	5611560	being committed to our relationship.
5611560	5614720	But what does him adoring a pink ribbon do for you?
5614720	5618860	Does it make him that much sexier?
5618860	5619960	Not really.
5619960	5625460	If I wanted to donate $5 towards breast cancer, I could just donate $5 instead of going out
5625460	5630800	and buying a whole new, you know, DS or, you know, I could donate however much I want and
5630800	5634740	get that as a tax write-off where it doesn't work that way if you buy the pink DS and let
5634740	5636760	Nintendo give them $5.
5636760	5643200	Well, on top of that, with all of these, you know, for example, the runs, the marketing
5643200	5647920	going in behind this, that's money they're spending on marketing and organizing events
5647920	5655360	that actually just could go to the research, especially for, you know, as poorly coordinated
5655360	5660480	as a lot of the research is right now, they should put, you know, the money into instead
5660480	5666520	of, we're all aware, the awareness is there, you know, I think that the money is better.
5666520	5667520	And you can go on-
5667520	5672300	Applied towards the event, you know, towards not the awareness of, but the treatment thereof.
5672300	5675600	And if you don't know how to donate, I mean, you can go to their website online.
5675600	5680280	It's so simple and pretty much, I mean, there's links that tell you how to donate right there.
5680280	5681280	I mean-
5681280	5682280	Komen.org.
5682280	5683280	K-O-M-E-N.O-R-G.
5683280	5684600	Exactly.
5684600	5690820	And I'm sorry, but this is, it does seem kind of like a cheap attempt to get women to play
5690820	5691920	their damn console.
5691920	5693560	I mean, I hate to say it-
5693560	5694560	Oh, I'm helping breast cancer!
5694560	5695560	No, you're not.
5695560	5696560	No, you're not.
5696560	5699600	Think of it, if you really want to make an impact to breast cancer and you don't really
5699600	5705600	care about this console, donate $129.99 to breast cancer, then there you go.
5705600	5711040	Well, I think there's a happy medium somewhere, but it's just, you know, or charge a little
5711040	5712240	more money for it.
5712240	5714160	You know, they do that with postage stamps, right?
5714160	5717280	They charge a little more money for it, but it's that extra money that goes towards the
5717280	5718280	research.
5718280	5719280	It's kind of like a donation.
5719280	5720280	I don't know.
5720280	5723760	It's just so that they can come out later on and go, look, we donated $100,000 to breast
5723760	5724760	cancer.
5724760	5727640	It's, you know, we're so helpful.
5727640	5728980	It's all for PR.
5728980	5730440	It's all to make them look good.
5730440	5735420	Giove Dea in our chat room says, sorry, but as a girl, I'd probably break a pink DS with
5735420	5738240	a hammer because it would be fun.
5738240	5741920	So sometimes, you know, you don't always get all the women with the pink and all that,
5741920	5748960	but my question would be, but what do you think of the white DS with the pink ribbon?
5748960	5752620	What about, you know, because they always talk about breast cancer and stuff, and they
5752620	5756500	have really good campaigns for breast cancer and cervical cancer and that kind of stuff,
5756500	5763120	but heart disease, just lung cancer, you know, diabetes, stuff like that, you know, that
5763120	5765000	kills a lot more people than breast cancer.
5765000	5768640	So how about donating to that instead, too?
5768640	5769640	All right.
5769640	5771240	There's no ribbon for that, unfortunately.
5771240	5775500	So yeah, certainly some controversial opinions in the community.
5775500	5776580	We look forward to hearing yours.
5776580	5777880	Mailbag at orangeonitrader.com.
5777880	5779760	Jamie will read them all live on air.
5779760	5780760	All right.
5780760	5786160	Just, just like, she'll read the next story.
5786160	5791920	The next story is, Orange Don't Radio host Rob Roberts ended up being found in the garbage
5791920	5796360	chopped to tiny bits with a I Told You So from co-host.
5796360	5797360	That's sad.
5797360	5798360	Huh?
5798360	5799360	Yeah, only to you.
5799360	5808720	Anyway, um, for our, uh, our wee friends who are wee little friends who are, uh, not only
5808720	5815800	virtual console users, but love NEC and Hudson and all the things associated with the PC
5815800	5821880	engine slash turbo graphics, we are getting super graphics games and I, I have to apologize
5821880	5826440	to Bobby for what I, uh, a little bit of incorrectness on my comment.
5826440	5833060	The super graphics actually was the successor to the PC engine, um, especially the PC engine
5833060	5843760	duo with the arcade card, uh, units as, um, 100%, uh, backwards compatible and had new
5843760	5846840	super hue card games that you could play.
5846840	5853060	Um, and also, uh, these other peripherals that never ended up coming out for it, including
5853060	5858440	a fully functional, uh, well, a full representation of a flight joystick like they've got for,
5858440	5860840	you know, the flight simulators on PC now.
5860840	5865920	But at any rate, um, super graphics games are going to be coming to virtual console.
5865920	5872880	The first of them being Dai Makaimura, which, uh, was, uh, Ghouls and Ghosts.
5872880	5878880	And honestly, the, I've seen the super graphics version of it and it's one of the best ever
5878880	5881820	as far as any type of, um, home system port.
5881820	5884200	So I am personally very excited about that.
5884200	5890440	Nintendo hasn't announced a US treatment, um, sorry, US release, but there are, um,
5890440	5895440	many C console imports at the shop channel, so hey, maybe we'll be getting it.
5895440	5896440	That'll be pretty cool.
5896440	5901120	But on top of that, other games, you know, that we, we could be looking forward to that
5901120	5908800	came out on, uh, super graphics in Japan was 1941 Counter-Attack, um, well, really, I think
5908800	5911960	that's about all the ones that we are going to know, uh, for sure, except for there was
5911960	5917400	a rumor that Strider was, um, there was a prototype for it, so we could be getting a
5917400	5921480	really good version of Strider if they decided to do a release on that, although the last,
5921480	5927800	uh, PC Engine release of that was, uh, the arcade card version for, uh, PC Engine Duo.
5927800	5931520	But, um, I'm, I'm really excited.
5931520	5936280	The super graphics, it, it was, the games were expensive, dude, they were like 110 bucks
5936280	5944720	a piece for HuCards and it could have done better if, you know, if it wasn't so expensive.
5944720	5949480	And how many of these are actually out there?
5949480	5950480	Not a lot, right?
5950480	5953880	There were seven created.
5953880	5954880	Two were unreleased.
5954880	5959000	One of them, um, No, we're not talking about the games, we're talking about the systems
5959000	5960000	itself.
5960000	5961000	There's not a lot of them.
5961000	5962000	Oh, the systems?
5962000	5963000	Yeah, there's not a lot of them out there, right?
5963000	5968400	Uh, I don't know off the top of my head, but I do know that you can still find them, actually.
5968400	5969400	Wow.
5969400	5975400	Um, in fact, uh, the, uh, the article that we're getting information from, uh, on Joystiq,
5975400	5980440	so that they got, there's Super Potato and, um, Akihabara for 250 bucks.
5980440	5981680	I've seen them before.
5981680	5985360	You actually, I think you'd have an easier time getting a super graphics than you would
5985360	5987000	a Duo LT.
5987000	5991240	I'm looking right now on eBay, just curious what people would charge for these, and I
5991240	5997000	see one, uh, NEC super graphics system with Battle Ace, new, very rare, $89.99, which
5997000	5999360	isn't bad, but there's six days left on it, so who knows what that is?
5999360	6000360	That's good luck, too.
6000360	6004600	That auction, I can see that auction going to about 200, 200, 250, like, you know, what
6004600	6011600	this one was, but then again, you know, you can also buy a, uh, a Duo RX for about, you
6011600	6018200	know, 175 to 200, so really, I don't think that it's that super rare, just because of
6018200	6022080	the limited release of the games, just not very well known in that respect, but I think
6022080	6024800	that they, I'll find out how many of them they produced.
6024800	6028960	All right, well, anyhow, um, regardless, you know, it's gonna bring a whole, you know,
6028960	6032920	even though, I guess, not a whole lot of new games, but certainly something that probably
6032920	6038440	a lot of people never have experienced before, uh, to the market via virtual consoles, so
6038440	6040800	that's neat, I suppose.
6040800	6044060	I bet you'll be checking out some of these games, DarkSakura.
6044060	6045060	Will you love them?
6045060	6048880	Well, I definitely would be, I'm definitely interested in getting Daimakai Mora, although,
6048880	6054040	honestly, I have the Saturn release, which was the arcade version, um, but it'd be cool,
6054040	6059280	I mean, to have it on, especially getting that over Super Ghouls N' Ghosts, because honestly,
6059280	6065360	that game was kind of crap for being in that series, but what was the, Chomakai Mora was
6065360	6073680	the name for that one, even going by the original name, um, but I'm not, I'm checking it out,
6073680	6077720	and I don't see exactly how many were made.
6077720	6082480	Well, they should just release all the games at once, just have a big Super Graphics week,
6082480	6084760	although I somehow doubt that'll happen.
6084760	6090880	But it actually, it seems pretty cool, though, that it, um, used, uh, two independently scrolling,
6090880	6094720	uh, background layers as far as its graphics output, sort of like how the Genesis did,
6094720	6098000	which, you know, was, like, one of the, in fact, they had a problem with some of the
6098000	6103200	releases of the games for one system versus the other, because of, uh, if it was a single
6103200	6108680	or dual layer for the app, it had used, uh, two video chips, it was a pretty advanced
6108680	6112840	system for its time, it just was pretty darn expensive.
6112840	6118320	Um, Face Distance Chat asks, why, wait, five games were released for the console, how long
6118320	6120000	a life could that have on virtual console?
6120000	6124200	Well, it's, I don't know if it's necessarily about trying to milk, you know, the life of,
6124200	6129400	of the, um, system, but let's face it, Nintendo or, you know, the companies behind it share
6129400	6132720	in the profits of, you know, however much they're gonna charge for each one of these
6132720	6137920	games, let's say $7 for each sale, you know, that's $7 they weren't gonna get before, especially
6137920	6142840	for a lot of people who have never played these games ever, ever, it's gonna be a bit
6142840	6144200	of money in their pocket.
6144200	6148520	Well, one thing, one thing, though, that also I, I, I think the reason why they're going
6148520	6152520	ahead and putting the Super Graphics games out is because basically a Super Graphics
6152520	6159560	really is just a, a souped up PC Engine, and if virtual console can emulate, um, PC Engine
6159560	6163920	games with no problem, especially to the CD games, there's absolutely no reason why it
6163920	6166560	can't, um, emulate the Super Graphics as well.
6166560	6172160	I mean, the, the audio output was exactly the same as the PC Engine, it was the same
6172160	6173160	thing.
6173160	6174160	Alright.
6174160	6175160	So.
6175160	6179280	You should look at that, uh, eBay link that Act F just posted, you might like that.
6179280	6180280	Yeah.
6180280	6181280	Alright.
6181280	6183240	Anyhow, uh, let's, let's move on, uh, more news.
6183240	6186320	We've spent an awful lot of time talking about a years old system, but that's alright, it's
6186320	6187320	part of gaming history.
6187320	6190680	Well, hey, didn't we talk about the, the Master System a few weeks ago?
6190680	6193800	I know, I know, well, who knows, next week we'll dedicate it to the Pippin.
6193800	6194800	Eh.
6194800	6201280	I don't know about that, but, um, there's news coming out of Famitsu Magazine saying
6201280	6207760	that Level 5 is going to be teaming up with Studio Ghibli on, um, a brand new DS project
6207760	6214280	entitled, uh, Ni No Kuni The Another World, and of course, um, the studio that brought
6214280	6221120	you Totoro and the plethora of other awesome animated films will be doing the animation
6221120	6223360	for that title as well.
6223360	6229200	And, um, to make the game unique, it will come with a Magic Master Book, I guess that
6229200	6233440	will be shared by the main character of the game, and which needs to be referred to while
6233440	6241040	playing the game, and, um, also they will be making a console version at some point.
6241040	6242360	So that's kinda cool.
6242360	6247760	Um, nice to see some pretty, you know, solid animated games coming to the DS.
6247760	6251360	Have we had a new Studio Ghibli movie in a while?
6251360	6252360	We haven't seen one in a while.
6252360	6256040	There's, uh, I thought there was a new one coming, but I thought there was one that was
6256040	6258640	like coming out this year or something, I just haven't heard much of it.
6258640	6260840	Maybe it already came out in Japan and it's not out here yet.
6260840	6261840	I don't know.
6261840	6265400	Ever since I got out of the movie department and, you know, I haven't really been paying
6265400	6270680	attention to what new movies are coming out from that studio, so, uh, yeah.
6270680	6271680	I thought I heard one coming out.
6271680	6272680	But all of them are gold.
6272680	6273680	I mean, seriously.
6273680	6274680	Yeah.
6274680	6275680	They're good movies.
6275680	6278240	So I'm very curious to see what kind of game comes out of this, because it could either
6278240	6282000	be really good or just one of those things that looks good on paper.
6282000	6284240	Well, Level 5 is not stopping there with that partnership.
6284240	6288620	They are also going to be making some new games for the PSP.
6288620	6291640	They don't really have anything to do with the Studio Ghibli project.
6291640	6295160	However, they are doing some other games on the PSP.
6295160	6298160	One of them is called Ushiro.
6298160	6302100	It's kind of a scary RPG, if you want to say, for the PSP.
6302100	6305400	You will actually kind of play as a shin-gami.
6305400	6311240	It's a god of death in Japanese lore, and you will fight monsters and also grant people's
6311240	6312320	wishes.
6312320	6314080	That's what the part of the game is.
6314080	6315200	So there you go.
6315200	6320720	There's another game called Dambol Senki, or Dambol Senki is also coming out, Cardboard
6320720	6321880	War Machine.
6321880	6325640	It's another RPG where you actually kind of build a robot and you battle against other
6325640	6327760	robots that you encounter.
6327760	6331600	Not a lot else known about that game, but some RPG projects for the PSP coming from
6331600	6337440	Level 5, which will certainly be of interest to PSP fans, because, you know, we don't often
6337440	6341360	hear about really, really big games on the PSP for a while now.
6341360	6344640	I mean, these games won't be coming out soon, but it's nice, especially with the PSP fans,
6344640	6346000	to know that these are coming out.
6346000	6349280	By the way, I don't think it made the show world tonight, but did anybody read on one
6349280	6352120	of the blogs this week something about, like, there was something where Sony was saying
6352120	6354280	they don't want ports anymore on the PSP?
6354280	6355280	They don't...
6355280	6356280	Yeah, they should talk.
6356280	6359280	I know, it's just kind of interesting, but...
6359280	6361280	No more ports on the PSP!
6361280	6364960	Well, they actually kind of port it in reverse a lot of times.
6364960	6366560	They port PSP games to PS2.
6366560	6368080	Well, I kind of thought that was interesting.
6368080	6371640	They don't want ports on the PSP, I think, of, you know, probably other...
6371640	6375080	But I'm thinking, like, well, they still got some big sellers, like, Puzzle Quest would
6375080	6376900	be a port that's a big sell, right?
6376900	6377900	Why would you want to say no to that?
6377900	6381000	Well, I think they were looking for games that are developed specifically for the PSP.
6381000	6384640	They don't want, like, because a lot of the games that come out, the PSP version isn't
6384640	6389760	exactly that strong, and so it's making the console look kind of weak.
6389760	6393520	But I think they need, I don't know, it's like a double-edged sword there.
6393520	6397360	They need more units to be sold, so more publishers get interested in it.
6397360	6401800	But they need more publishers that are interested in it, so they can get more units sold.
6401800	6404320	Before Dr. Salker gets to the next story, I got the answer to the question I was looking
6404320	6405320	for.
6405320	6411120	SSJ100Matt in chat says, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea just came out from Studio Ghibli.
6411120	6414400	And I thought I heard something about that that was the name of the new movie.
6414400	6416440	But it's, correct me if I'm wrong, it's only out in Japan, right?
6416440	6419840	It hasn't come out here because Disney has to do their thing with the translation and
6419840	6420840	all that.
6420840	6424120	So we probably won't see it till early next year, probably.
6424120	6425120	So.
6425120	6429440	Alright, we can move on with gaming news, right, Dr. Salker?
6429440	6430440	That we can.
6430440	6435640	Well, there is some news about, for City of Heroes, I know that there are plenty of people
6435640	6444520	who still play that, that the mission editor is actually going to be delayed, so now issue
6444520	6449600	13 is to be retitled power and responsibility.
6449600	6455560	It has everything else that was supposed to come out with the architect mode and an extension
6455560	6463440	for the sidekick buddy system that's a leveling pact, so basically it lets you and your friends
6463440	6467680	synchronize your experience so that you're always at the same level.
6467680	6473720	And even if one person plays more than the other, so you can play together more on an
6473720	6474720	even keel.
6474720	6475720	That's kind of cool.
6475720	6481800	Also, there's multi-builds, so you can keep two different versions of the same character.
6481800	6486920	There's also day jobs, power sets, and merit rewards will be included as well.
6486920	6491200	And they say that the architect mission editor will be coming out later.
6491200	6498640	But also, part of the thing in it is supposed to let you create your own NPCs for those
6498640	6501360	missions, so that's pretty cool.
6501360	6502640	Very cool.
6502640	6510920	Well, one Marvel superhero has had a couple, I don't know, tie-ins with the comic that
6510920	6512960	weren't exactly great.
6512960	6522040	Some of the last couple movies actually have been kind of from horrible to not awesome.
6522040	6528120	But yes, Punisher will be getting not only a new movie this year, but a new game thanks
6528120	6530280	to the PlayStation Network.
6530280	6536880	Punisher No Mercy is exclusive to the PlayStation Network and will be coming to us from Zen
6536880	6545120	Studios, who unfortunately don't have much of a resume, but Rocky and Bullwinkle, the
6545120	6550280	Xbox Live Arcade game and the new Mushroom Man game, which is kind of, eh, alright.
6550280	6554960	But who knows, maybe this is the diamond in the rough.
6554960	6561840	It will be powered by the Unreal 3 engine, and of course we'll follow Frank Castle as
6561840	6563440	he seeks revenge.
6563440	6568640	And they've got some screenshots out for the game so far, it actually looks pretty good.
6568640	6578640	No word on how it's going to play, but apparently also, I guess, I don't know.
6578640	6581040	It's no word on when exactly it's going to be released.
6581040	6583520	I would imagine maybe around the time of the film.
6583520	6590360	Oh, that's what it says, aiming to release the game in line with the new Punisher film.
6590360	6595400	And it will include both single and multiplayer modes as well, character customizations and
6595400	6596400	trophies.
6596400	6603040	Alright, well, hopefully we'll see more about this game developing in the next few months.
6603040	6606040	And hopefully there'll be a demo, because...
6606040	6607360	Demos are a good way to try games.
6607360	6610440	Yes, exactly, especially if they're questionable on their quality.
6610440	6611440	Alright.
6611440	6616280	Hey, some folks in chat disagree with our assessment of the Rocky and Bullwinkle arcade
6616280	6617280	game.
6617280	6618280	Act Def says, Rocky and Bullwinkle is awesome.
6618280	6620160	I agree, the cartoon is awesome.
6620160	6624400	SonicM88 says, why did everyone hate Rocky and Bullwinkle?
6624400	6628720	It just, I don't know, the fun factor was kind of missing from that game, especially
6628720	6632640	for something so nostalgic, the game just kind of felt cheap to me.
6632640	6636520	I don't know, it's really hard to put my finger on it, but it just kind of felt like it just
6636520	6638920	got, like, it wasn't any fun.
6638920	6643640	The minigames were kind of like, they might make you smile for a second, but then you're
6643640	6645200	like, eh, I can't see myself playing this.
6645200	6647200	It would have been a better game on the Wii.
6647200	6648280	You think?
6648280	6649520	With the motion control and everything?
6649520	6650520	Maybe.
6650520	6651520	Maybe.
6651520	6654860	I mean, it's just, the Wii seems to be the party game machine, but at the same time it's
6654860	6656560	getting over killed with that stuff.
6656560	6659160	That genre is way too much on there.
6659160	6665040	It's like if you want to call, you know, the Xbox 360 a first person shooter console, then
6665040	6668960	the Wii is definitely the party game console.
6668960	6673600	Alright, moving on, and this is going to, you know, our long time fans, you know, because
6673600	6677440	I think we mention this quite often, we had started originally way back on episode one
6677440	6682400	as a show really revolving around music based video games, and especially DDR was a big
6682400	6686080	focus of this game, of that era, of Orange Launch Radio.
6686080	6689120	So I'm sure a lot of our listeners who remember that, you know, still follow what goes on
6689120	6693440	in the DDR world, are going to find this news very interesting, because it isn't about DDR,
6693440	6697280	but a possible new competitor to DDR, question mark.
6697280	6702020	Not a lot is known about it, but we do know that a patent has been filed with the official
6702020	6708900	US Patent and Trademark Office by Activision for a game called Dance Hero.
6708900	6713560	Just like Guitar Hero, so on and so on, now we are going to, and DJ Hero, which we know
6713560	6716600	is already kind of in the works, Dance Hero.
6716600	6721380	It's going to be an interactive video game program and video game controllers.
6721380	6726680	But before you just jump in straight in your mind to rip off, you know, you got to think,
6726680	6731120	well, you know, even if Guitar Hero was certainly inspired by Guitar Freaks, they changed a
6731120	6732200	heck of a lot about it.
6732200	6736080	I mean, the look and feel is not really the same, and certainly in the song list and the
6736080	6738760	way it plays out, it's much different.
6738760	6744300	I for one, I'm very curious to see how they kind of go to Dance Hero.
6744300	6750060	I've said this for a long time back in the old, you know, DDR centric episodes of Orange
6750060	6755840	Lounge Radio is that Konami really badly needed to scrap their engine completely and rebuild
6755840	6757200	the game from the ground up.
6757200	6761200	And in a way, I think that's exactly what's going to happen here with what Activision
6761200	6764800	is doing is that they're going to take a dance game concept and rebuild it from the ground
6764800	6765800	up.
6765800	6768080	So that could be very interesting.
6768080	6773820	And I'm not ready to scream theft just yet, because I have a feeling this could be something
6773820	6774820	kind of new and innovative.
6774820	6775820	You know what I mean?
6775820	6776820	I don't know.
6776820	6778280	What do you guys think?
6778280	6787600	New and innovative, from a company who ripped off Guitar Freak's Drummania and made it better,
6787600	6788600	might make it better.
6788600	6789600	Might make it better.
6789600	6791000	To be honest, I don't think they're really going to change.
6791000	6796040	It's probably going to look like a Guitar Hero type of game, but instead of maybe, you
6796040	6799840	know, notes scrolling down the screen, it's going to be arrows or steps or feet or something,
6799840	6802160	I don't know, to that effect.
6802160	6806600	But I know, I hear you.
6806600	6808560	They're whoring the brand to death.
6808560	6809560	Seriously.
6809560	6810560	Right, right.
6810560	6814480	You know, and I see all those concerns, but at the same time, I kind of feel like, oh,
6814480	6817320	somebody might be finally reinventing the approach to the dance game, because let's
6817320	6824440	face it, every other dance game that's come out, In the Groove, the, what am I thinking
6824440	6825440	of?
6825440	6829360	The freaking game that you can use your own CDs on that was terrible on the PS2.
6829360	6830840	What the hell was that game?
6830840	6831840	Dance Factory.
6831840	6834200	Factory or whatever, yeah, Dance Factory or whatever.
6834200	6836300	They've all pretty much been the same damn thing.
6836300	6838480	It's four arrows that you stomp to.
6838480	6840880	Well, maybe this could be something different.
6840880	6844920	Well, if we're going to go the Activision route, then it's going to have 80 billion
6844920	6847240	arrows and it's going to be fucking hard.
6847240	6852520	Now, I'm sorry, I just, it just seems like that they're really going, hey, these games
6852520	6854480	actually sell, you know?
6854480	6855880	Let's make a ton of them.
6855880	6859720	And, you know, I have no problem with them doing like DJ Hero, and if it's good, great,
6859720	6861640	then maybe I'll anticipate this game.
6861640	6864640	But I have a feeling it's not going to be that innovative.
6864640	6867920	DJ Hero sounds nothing like Beatmania.
6867920	6873400	That sounds like Guitar Hero, but exchange the guitar for a DJ turntable.
6873400	6878240	I mean, seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if you could use the DJ turntable in Guitar
6878240	6880640	Hero because it probably is just another controller.
6880640	6886120	Instead of the strum bar, it's scratching, and instead of the fret buttons, it's keys.
6886120	6887120	Oh my God!
6887120	6891360	So much innovation, it blows my mind!
6891360	6894160	Will I be able to get star power too by shaking the turntable?
6894160	6898040	Oh, well, maybe I'll have a crossfader for that, you know?
6898040	6900520	God, I'm sorry.
6900520	6901520	I'm not interested.
6901520	6902520	What are they going to do?
6902520	6903520	I bet you, you know what?
6903520	6907320	They're going to, they're going to be able, they're, you know why?
6907320	6911040	Because they have Guitar Hero behind them, and they have these games behind them, they're
6911040	6915500	going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted for DDR, and they're not going
6915500	6918000	to have to fill up a song list with originals.
6918000	6922320	Granted, we as DDR fans have come to know and love those Konami originals, but it's part
6922320	6924680	of the reason why the game didn't sell us well over here.
6924680	6927820	You know, they're having to rely on a lot of Japan-centric songs.
6927820	6931480	They're going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted in DDR.
6931480	6932480	And they know it.
6932480	6936400	But half the fun was the songs that were created by the company themselves and their own in-house
6936400	6937880	artists.
6937880	6941440	They don't have any in-house artists, okay?
6941440	6942440	They have...
6942440	6943440	That we know of.
6943440	6944540	They could be partnering up with something.
6944540	6948800	I'm sorry, but even the best song list in the world is not going to make this game any
6948800	6949800	good.
6949800	6952880	It's not going to have magic shoes you've got to buy, because you know this game's going
6952880	6955480	to have a damn peripheral attached to it, because how the hell are they going to be
6955480	6956480	original?
6956480	6957480	Magic shoes might be kind of fun.
6957480	6964760	Okay, I have one absolute, one word that completely is an utter rebuttal to everything that Loki
6964760	6967120	is saying.
6967120	6969200	Speculation.
6969200	6970200	It is.
6970200	6971200	It's all speculation.
6971200	6972200	You don't...
6972200	6973200	Track record.
6973200	6974200	They hoard this thing.
6974200	6976960	I swear to God, they hoard this thing so bad.
6976960	6982760	You watch next year when Guitar Hero has, oh, four to six game releases, and people
6982760	6984440	are going, my God.
6984440	6989240	I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero...
6989240	6990240	Five cents.
6990240	6991240	I would...
6991240	6992240	No, more than that.
6992240	6995560	I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero will sell more copies in the Beat
6995560	6996560	Mania video in this country.
6996560	6997560	Fifty cents.
6997560	6998960	Yeah, I can guarantee that will happen.
6998960	7003840	And I don't know if I can make the same thing for Dance Hero, because it has done very,
7003840	7004840	very well in places too.
7004840	7006280	But DJ Hero will sell by its name alone.
7006280	7009680	It could be the worst game ever, but people go, oh my God, I want to be a DJ.
7009680	7011560	But what if it's not bad?
7011560	7013960	I'm not saying DJ Hero will be bad.
7013960	7015840	I'm saying Dance Hero will be bad.
7015840	7017000	What if it's not?
7017000	7018240	It's gonna suck.
7018240	7019240	It's gonna suck.
7019240	7020240	All right.
7020240	7021240	Big time.
7021240	7027560	If it sells more than, okay, how many copies of Guitar Hero, the first Guitar Hero sold?
7027560	7028560	Oh, I don't know.
7028560	7032800	When, during its first month of release?
7032800	7035360	Not enough until it went on 360.
7035360	7036360	I don't think.
7036360	7039920	Well, plus they had to get the first game out there to license the songs everybody wanted
7039920	7040920	to play.
7040920	7041920	It doesn't matter anyways.
7041920	7042920	Because this game will never...
7042920	7050440	So if it, say that it sells more in its first month than Guitar Hero did.
7050440	7053400	Dance Hero will not sell more than Guitar Hero did in its first month.
7053400	7054400	Do you bet your...
7054400	7055400	Oh.
7055400	7056400	Oh.
7056400	7057400	Oh.
7057400	7058400	Oh.
7058400	7059400	No.
7059400	7060400	I disagree, sir.
7060400	7061400	I think there's a bet forming here.
7061400	7062400	No, there is not a bet forming here.
7062400	7064120	The only bet is the Eye of Judgment, okay?
7064120	7068000	This is just a registered trademark, we don't know what this is at all, and we don't even
7068000	7069000	know if it will come out.
7069000	7070000	So why are you thinking that it's gonna...
7070000	7071000	Well, okay, so...
7071000	7073560	Because I saw the Eye of Judgment, I'm like, wow, that is a piece of shit.
7073560	7076800	I mean, I even said, what is the point of this game?
7076800	7078460	But you haven't seen Dance Hero.
7078460	7080560	You don't know anything about it other than a name.
7080560	7081560	I know.
7081560	7084840	I don't know anything about it except for the name, but I know the track record of what
7084840	7087560	they're doing with Guitar Hero, and how they're looking at...
7087560	7088560	Guitar Hero was good.
7088560	7089560	All right.
7089560	7093040	Yeah, Guitar Hero was good, but see, the problem is they're looking at what Konami has done
7093040	7096120	with their games and just kind of trying to mimic it.
7096120	7097840	But that doesn't mean it's not gonna be good.
7097840	7102080	Yeah, we can go ahead and take the devil's advocate thing, but the fact of the matter
7102080	7106360	is they need a peripheral with every one of these fucking hero games, so what is the magic
7106360	7109760	peripheral that's gonna come along with this, and really, is it gonna innovate anything
7109760	7111720	other than having a better song list?
7111720	7112720	Eye Toy.
7112720	7118040	It'll use the Eye Toy, and you can wave your hands around and wiggle your butt.
7118040	7121840	To be honest, this game will not probably hit until like 2010 anyways, so what do I
7121840	7122840	even care?
7122840	7125640	We haven't had a good argument here on OLR in a long time.
7125640	7126640	This is nice.
7126640	7131520	But I will fucking say I told you so when this game comes out and it's a piece of shit.
7131520	7135200	I will rub it in your face like dirty feces.
7135200	7136920	You know what, though?
7136920	7137920	Everything's a matter of...
7137920	7140280	Track record is two words, speculation is one word.
7140280	7143800	You were supposed to sum it up in one word, therefore you are disqualified, and your opinion
7143800	7145200	is thrown out.
7145200	7148000	I make my own damn rules.
7148000	7152080	That's okay, because we're entitled to make our own rules and change them at will.
7152080	7158560	You lose, a man will never win an argument with a woman, because we are awesome and men
7158560	7159560	aren't.
7159560	7160560	Sorry.
7160560	7161560	Wow.
7161560	7162560	You should know that.
7162560	7163560	You're married.
7163560	7164560	Yeah.
7164560	7169120	Nellie, if you're listening, come up here and lay down the law.
7169120	7170120	All right.
7170120	7171120	Wow.
7171120	7172120	All right.
7172120	7173120	You know what?
7173120	7174120	You know what?
7174120	7175120	Lots of good...
7175120	7176120	You know what?
7176120	7178960	Whether you agree with Loki or not, you know, lots of good points being brought up around
7178960	7181520	the board, and I'm sure we're gonna have some calls on it later as well.
7181520	7185840	Well, I mean, no offense to the answer, but I think the logical step for them would be
7185840	7188520	to do like a keyboard hero, because that's at least something you can add.
7188520	7190080	Because we haven't had keyboard mania.
7190080	7193280	Well, we haven't had DDR either.
7193280	7194280	Seriously?
7194280	7199000	Fuck Konami with a big chainsaw for disbanding that series, because keyboard mania I was
7199000	7201000	actually pretty good at, and it pisses me off.
7201000	7202800	Who is in charge of the DDR series now?
7202800	7204760	Is it like on autopilot or something?
7204760	7206360	Because I mean, what is seriously happening?
7206360	7207360	I don't know.
7207360	7210440	But okay, besides all that, I really do think that they should bring like a keyboard thing
7210440	7215640	up, because then that way you can add it to, you know, Guitar Hero World Tour or whatever,
7215640	7216920	and you can have keyboards with a lot of stuff.
7216920	7219880	Who doesn't want to play Van Halen's jump with a keyboard mania?
7219880	7221160	We need Sax Maniacs.
7221160	7222160	All right.
7222160	7226440	All right, now this is gonna lead to Bagpipe Hero and Didgeridoo Hero.
7226440	7227440	All right.
7227440	7228440	It's our hero.
7228440	7230800	Let's move on.
7230800	7231800	We've got...
7231800	7232800	Oh, they made a sitar hero, remember?
7232800	7233800	Yeah, online.
7233800	7235400	That was for the guru of love.
7235400	7240240	All right, we're gonna move on to the email bag, because I'm sure this whole subject's
7240240	7245000	gonna get brought up again during the phone calls, so we'll come back round two later
7245000	7246000	on.
7246000	7247000	But for now, round one is over.
7247000	7249320	All right, let's go to the mail bag.
7249320	7255400	Every week, you guys email us at mailbagatorangelaundry.com, and DarkSakura dives in the mail bag and reads
7255400	7258920	a few of her favorites after she drinks some soda.
7258920	7259920	Well, the music's playing.
7259920	7260920	What are we gonna do?
7260920	7261920	Just sit here and wait?
7261920	7263920	Well, we can stare at the ants.
7263920	7265800	Is there more ants now?
7265800	7268120	Yeah, but they're attacking something on the floor, and I don't really know what.
7268120	7270000	I saw like a trail of them.
7270000	7271000	They're running over there.
7271000	7272000	I'm off to get the raid.
7272000	7273960	Oh, I can't, because I don't smell like raid in here.
7273960	7274960	God damn it.
7274960	7275960	They're just like...
7275960	7276960	Okay.
7276960	7277960	How about a fire?
7277960	7278960	Email time.
7278960	7279960	Let's set fire to the...
7279960	7280960	Let's set fire to the floor and burn all the ants.
7280960	7283720	Did you ever watch that YouTube video of the guy burning the hornet's nest on his child's
7283720	7284720	swing set?
7284720	7285720	Oh my gosh.
7285720	7288600	Setting it on fire with as many different flammable things as he could find?
7288600	7289600	I was like, stupid?
7289600	7292600	I don't know, but I think I'll be looking that up right now.
7292600	7293600	Okay.
7293600	7294600	Setting fire to swing set.
7294600	7296720	Look up fucking moron and you'll find him.
7296720	7298560	Well, that could be a ton of videos on there.
7298560	7300120	I got to look fire swing set.
7300120	7301120	Okay.
7301120	7303520	I think it's fire and hornets, but anyway.
7303520	7307960	First email comes from Hunter Red, aka Redertainment.
7307960	7310240	Hey y'all.
7310240	7313600	You know, I can't say y'all without saying it in accent.
7313600	7314600	Y'all.
7314600	7319720	As you know, the season where the masses choose which douchebag will represent them is upon
7319720	7321760	us and I have the question to that end.
7321760	7327320	I'm going to send an email to all the douchebags running for Congress in my district and I
7327320	7332200	want to ask them how they feel about video games and the legislation that is currently
7332200	7333800	pending about them.
7333800	7337000	Is there a way I should phrase my email so that I can get a response from them other
7337000	7338320	than not calling them douchebags?
7338320	7341960	That's going to smell, man.
7341960	7345000	I would have done it, but it'll smell.
7345000	7346000	Point point.
7346000	7350200	I know that because illustrated quite well.
7350200	7355840	By the way, Sky, that means you, mister, I've left the studio to try to set fire to the
7355840	7356840	ants.
7356840	7357840	I've left the studio to fire.
7357840	7362480	By the way, Sky, if you hate the influence of the Mormon Church in politics in California,
7362480	7363680	you should come to Utah.
7363680	7365680	They're everywhere and are everything.
7365680	7371600	No, I've heard about Utah and it's, you know, it's just, you know, you guys, if you listen
7371600	7375160	to the show last week, you already know how I feel about Proposition 8 and how it's, you
7375160	7379360	know, setting civil rights back about 50 years, but you know, what can you do?
7379360	7383760	Honestly, if you want to see the influence of the Mormon Church, just go talk to a boy,
7383760	7387440	you know, boy scout troop.
7387440	7388440	Thanks love the show.
7388440	7392000	You do what I ask for any podcasts I listen to at work to do, inform, entertain and make
7392000	7393000	me laugh.
7393000	7396400	Thanks again, Hunter Red, aka Redertainment.
7396400	7398480	You're welcome.
7398480	7399480	Next one.
7399480	7400480	Yes.
7400480	7405920	Hey guys, Dan Shadow here with your helpful hints for Warhammer Online.
7405920	7410640	There are thousands of Tome unlocks and hundreds of titles you can earn.
7410640	7414560	I'm going to help you get some of the nicer title unlocks.
7414560	7417480	First take off all your clothes.
7417480	7421360	Second use a hundred abilities to be known as the show off.
7421360	7425260	Third talk to a hundred citizens while naked to be a flirt.
7425260	7429400	If you target another naked player a hundred times, you'll become the ogler.
7429400	7433240	If you want to get a nice title that doesn't involve nudity, then jump off a cliff and
7433240	7434240	die.
7434240	7439240	If you do this 25 times, you can have the word floating above your head.
7439240	7440920	That's all the helpful hints for this week.
7440920	7444800	I just got into the little big planet beta, so I'll let you guys know how that one goes
7444800	7445800	when I can.
7445800	7446800	See ya.
7446800	7450160	I want to be in the little big planet beta so that I don't even have a PS3.
7450160	7452360	I just want a key to say I'm in it and you're not.
7452360	7455920	I want to be in a game and have ahhhh floating over my head.
7455920	7458240	Or remember there was an impossible mission.
7458240	7460600	You've been listening to Orange Lounge.
7460600	7463880	No, OLR's not over, sorry.
7463880	7464880	And the show's canceled.
7464880	7466920	Good night, everyone.
7466920	7468640	Next email.
7468640	7473120	My question for OLR this week is, do you guys have a backlog of video games to play slash
7473120	7474720	finish and how large is the backlog?
7474720	7476920	Oh shit, you really want me to answer that?
7476920	7481000	Personally I have a backlog on PS2 and even on the Xbox 360, which I only purchased a
7481000	7482000	couple months ago.
7482000	7484800	The majority are some RPGs and some action games.
7484800	7488760	I feel that DDR and World of Warcraft sometimes eat up a lot of my free time, but I'm not
7488760	7491220	sure what stops me from finishing some games.
7491220	7496240	As promised, Triple A'd an old school DDR song, Burnin' the Floor, in honor of OLR and 300th
7496240	7497240	Show.
7497240	7500120	You actually sent a picture of it, too.
7500120	7503160	This email is brought to you by Dark Sakura School of Dancing Ferrets.
7503160	7505960	Peace out and Triple A'd, Jammer Jones.
7505960	7511760	Off the top of my head, Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, Final Fantasy XII, they're all games
7511760	7512760	I need to finish.
7512760	7514240	Kingdom Hearts 2, shit, I never finished that one.
7514240	7515720	I got really far and I didn't finish it.
7515720	7517000	There's tons of games I need to finish.
7517000	7518000	I have a gaming ADD.
7518000	7521080	I've said it a million times on this show.
7521080	7522080	Especially this time of year.
7522080	7523080	That's a huge ass freaking picture.
7523080	7526400	How can you play just one game this time of year?
7526400	7530040	It seems like every week leading up to Christmas, there's a new freaking game coming out that
7530040	7531040	I have to play.
7531040	7534960	Like Fable 2 is coming out soon, and I barely have touched Warhammer or Spore, even.
7534960	7539200	I think I've sunk maybe five hours into Spore, tops, and already there's new games coming
7539200	7540520	out I want.
7540520	7542800	That's just the way it goes, isn't it?
7542800	7555440	But he sent us quite the massive image of his Triple A, but it is there with 309 perfect
7555440	7557680	steps and a perfect score.
7557680	7559680	Well done to you.
7559680	7561320	Here's the big one.
7561320	7562320	Strong Bad.
7562320	7563320	The episodic Strong Bad's games.
7563320	7566400	I freaking know people that have worked on those games and I keep saying I'm going to
7566400	7568480	support them and I want to play the games.
7568480	7572200	I haven't even touched them yet, just because there's been so much else that have been grabbing
7572200	7573200	my attention.
7573200	7575720	But I really do want to play the Strong Bad games at some point.
7575720	7579840	My present backlog is I actually do want to go back and finish Kingdom Hearts 2.
7579840	7583280	And I actually never finished Final Fantasy X because I got so pissed off that I'd rushed
7583280	7589040	through leveling the game that I got to one of the battles with what's his stupid face
7589040	7591120	with his ugly blue hair.
7591120	7594400	And I got to the Glyph Mine battle, passed that, and none of my characters were high
7594400	7598040	enough to stand one hit, so that's my own bad.
7598040	7604560	And I still have to finish Kingdom Hearts 2, but I glitched the game, like in a major
7604560	7605560	way.
7605560	7606560	Nice.
7606560	7611100	I skipped some level and now I can't get into doing the Pride Lands.
7611100	7613360	So it's pretty stupid.
7613360	7618120	I think I did like Halloween Town twice in a row or something, but right now I still
7618120	7623200	have to get started on The World Ends With You, which I finally have, I'm so happy.
7623200	7628820	And I'm also playing through Final Fantasy VI and I'm still trying to find the stupid
7628820	7632680	way back to whatever the Narshe Town is.
7632680	7638320	So it goes to show just how long it's been since I've played that damn game.
7638320	7639320	Next email?
7639320	7640320	Next email.
7640320	7644760	I was just wondering, and I just started listening to the podcast, so I'm not certain if you
7644760	7648720	guys have talked about this, what you guys thought about the makers of Psychonauts making
7648720	7649720	a sequel.
7649720	7654520	Seeing as how I think it was rated as 14th greatest Xbox, even though it wasn't a great
7654520	7659360	seller to my knowledge, Xbox Live gamertag quick sticks.
7659360	7663400	Excellent question, and you know, that's another one of those games I didn't play a lot of.
7663400	7667520	I have played Psychonauts, just not a lot in depth.
7667520	7672960	I don't see how it's a bad thing though, Psychonauts had a lot of fans, and a lot of people have
7672960	7675600	been slowly discovering that game over the years.
7675600	7678320	It's kind of like a cult game, like a cult movie.
7678320	7682080	Not a lot of people see it when it first comes out, but it sells really well on DVD.
7682080	7684080	People wanted to go back and check it out later, that's kind of what Psychonauts is.
7684080	7688160	It's one of those games that people get together and sacrifice virgins on altars in the basement
7688160	7689160	of their buildings.
7689160	7691240	And drink the Kool-Aid, no, it's not that kind of game.
7691240	7698720	But I didn't play enough of the first one to really say, oh, I'm excited about a sequel.
7698720	7702660	But I know that the first game was unique enough with a cool sense of humor about it
7702660	7705840	that I think a second game will be welcomed, and I bet you more people check out the sequel
7705840	7707080	than the first one.
7707080	7710200	And making a sequel, honestly, will get more people to check out the original, which is
7710200	7715320	available as an Xbox Live original, if I'm not mistaken.
7715320	7720560	One of our listeners, I guess, I'm never quite sure how to pronounce it, but I think it's
7720560	7721560	Neige.
7721560	7727760	But anyway, one of our British listeners saw a story on the BBC News website and linked
7727760	7734520	it to us, which is a Germany arrest over gamer death, where a man is arrested in Germany
7734520	7739680	on suspicion of the murder of a 20-year-old internet gamer in Nottingham.
7739680	7744960	Checking out the article as soon as it loads up.
7744960	7750520	And I'll link the article in the chat room, since it's very nice to share that with us.
7750520	7752600	As soon as the damn thing loads.
7752600	7758120	Matthew Pike, 20, was found stabbed in his flat above the Orange Tree Pub on North Sherwood
7758120	7759880	Street on Friday.
7759880	7768920	So the one arrested was a guy from Lindbergh, and apparently they, I guess, played the game
7768920	7769920	together or something.
7769920	7774120	I'm not seeing what game was listed in it, but they were friends over the internet and
7774120	7778360	played games together, and dude's like, whatever, die, and kill him.
7778360	7782320	At least, that's what they're thinking so far.
7782320	7785600	So I'll link the article in the chat.
7785600	7789520	That's sad, and stupid.
7789520	7793080	So does that mean if you can't beat them, you should gank them?
7793080	7794080	Nice.
7794080	7798560	But thank you for sharing that with us.
7798560	7804120	Also cheeseburger, somebody go smack cheeseburger around with the large child in the chat room
7804120	7807120	for me, because the email was dongle.
7807120	7812160	No, that was worth a day two weeks ago.
7812160	7815080	When I got my Bluetooth dongle back in the day when I thought I could use it to transfer
7815080	7820680	stuff on my phone, I thought that that was the single most freaking hilarious word in
7820680	7821680	the universe.
7821680	7827080	Because I mean, just saying dongle, it's almost as much fun as saying balls.
7827080	7828080	Last email.
7828080	7829080	Alrighty.
7829080	7831080	This comes from Isabelle.
7831080	7834880	These are just some photos me and my friend took for Pyramid Head Day.
7834880	7839120	We made cupcakes with little pyramid head heads on top of them, and I made a pyramid
7839120	7840400	head costume.
7840400	7841520	Happy Pyramid Head Day.
7841520	7843580	Hope Silent Hill Homecoming is awesome.
7843580	7846880	But none of you get to see them, because I haven't actually uploaded them anywhere.
7846880	7849080	They're on our email.
7849080	7854520	But they are funny and cute, and Pyramid Head is tasty delicious.
7854520	7858440	Hooray for Pyramid Head Day.
7858440	7863380	Well I'm really glad that people actually went and celebrated Pyramid Head Day.
7863380	7864380	That's wonderful.
7864380	7866640	I hope we get more pictures of the coming weeks.
7866640	7867840	It's Pee-Hitty Day.
7867840	7868840	Pee-Hitty Day.
7868840	7871000	Vote or Pee-Hitty will kill you.
7871000	7872000	Seriously.
7872000	7873560	That's it?
7873560	7874560	For email.
7874560	7878440	Alright, if you want to send us an email next time, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7878440	7881320	Wouldn't it be Pee-Hitty?
7881320	7882320	Shut up.
7882320	7883320	I don't know.
7883320	7884320	You know what it is?
7884320	7886320	It's whatever I say it is.
7886320	7888600	It's whatever you say it is.
7888600	7889600	Nice.
7889600	7897600	As before the mailbag, we were talking a little bit about some game companies, and of course
7897600	7903760	other game companies, other than Activision, but I'm sure they agree on this, Bungee.
7903760	7910080	The game developer believes that game companies should pocket money from used game sales.
7910080	7917980	And it seems, I guess, that they feel since the used sales, like for example, had a big
7917980	7925000	impact on Halo, and when you have a multi-million dollar seller game, and I guess they're losing
7925000	7930720	money on used copies of the game, because people buy those instead of a new copy, and
7930720	7939680	you can thank GameStop for a lot of that too, they feel that they want a piece of that pie.
7939680	7944940	So I think they're wrong though, because that's retarded.
7944940	7949160	If I buy something and I sell it to somebody else, why should you get a piece of that?
7949160	7955800	Yeah, like if I sell my refrigerator to someone else, because I'm going to get a newer, fancier
7955800	7959360	refrigerator, I don't have to send Maytag 20 bucks.
7959360	7960360	You know what I mean?
7960360	7965400	Yeah, it's basically like, you know, I saw some comments or something, talkbacks about
7965400	7971120	it, and it's like, you own your money 100%, and it's all bartering basically, because
7971120	7975880	you're trading your money for 100% ownership of said game.
7975880	7982080	So if they want a portion of when you sell that game, then you should get a portion of
7982080	7985840	the money that they spend on, say, when they buy groceries.
7985840	7988480	CD industries had to deal with this for years, it hasn't killed them.
7988480	7990720	Piracy killed the CD industry.
7990720	7991720	Exactly.
7991720	7998060	I think, I mean, used game sales can be good, because you say a consumer doesn't really
7998060	8002840	want to buy your game at full price, and say they buy Halo 1, and then they'll like it,
8002840	8005840	and then they go out and buy Halo 2 when it comes out.
8005840	8006840	So it's extra sales.
8006840	8011080	I don't see how this is a bad thing, and besides, you already got paid, okay?
8011080	8016620	I mean, why are they even complaining about the fact that they don't sell as many units?
8016620	8019680	Because they've already sold those units to retail stores.
8019680	8026200	The retail stores now have to sell them, you know, and if they decide to sell used games
8026200	8031000	over new games, like a lot of these game stores like GameStop, they push their used sales,
8031000	8036140	in fact, if they have a used copy in, they'll be like, hey, do you want the used copy instead?
8036140	8039060	They push those first because they're making more money off of them anyways, so what's
8039060	8040060	it matter?
8040060	8043960	Because they've already paid you for the product, you're not losing out on anything.
8043960	8048200	The Rob D. has an interesting comment in chat, guess what, developers, DLC exists, give us
8048200	8049560	a reason to keep it.
8049560	8051320	Even better, make additional content free.
8051320	8052320	Exactly.
8052320	8053320	Give us a reason to keep your game.
8053320	8056360	Just build the contents where it's at, because that's a way you can make more money off of
8056360	8058160	each game you sell.
8058160	8061000	I don't know.
8061000	8063680	But yeah, I definitely don't think that they should ever get to the point where they have
8063680	8067040	to, you know, get a portion of used sales.
8067040	8068040	That's just stupid.
8068040	8073560	Alright, well, moving on to people that want, other people that want a piece of the pie.
8073560	8080600	Activision Blizzard has gone on the record, the CEO Bobby Kotick has said some, basically
8080600	8088200	a response to what the Warner Music executive Edgar Bronfman said previously, and what he
8088200	8092080	had said was that the royalty rates for songs that are used in like Guitar Hero, Rock Band
8092080	8095080	and so on are paltry.
8095080	8097720	Basically that they're getting paid peanuts, they're not getting paid enough money for
8097720	8099440	using the music in these games.
8099440	8104400	Well, the Activision CEO, Bobby Kotick, has come back and said the comment was one-sided.
8104400	8109640	In fact, he says that these games that have the licensed tracks in them, they have a significant
8109640	8113040	impact on the record and ticket sales of the contributing artist.
8113040	8117880	So he's kind of thinking aloud, maybe that the musicians, quote, should be paying any
8117880	8122200	money, or I'm sorry, the companies, quote, should be paying any money at all to the musicians,
8122200	8124480	and whether it should be the reverse.
8124480	8127720	Maybe people should be paying them to put their songs in the game.
8127720	8129640	It's like free advertising.
8129640	8134880	No, because the songs make the game, and if, you know, you want to take that route and
8134880	8139480	like, well, we're not going to put any songs in our game unless you pay us to do it, yeah,
8139480	8141960	go right ahead and see what your song list looks like then.
8141960	8142960	Right.
8142960	8143960	That's a very good point.
8143960	8146160	Without these songs, then the game is going to be nothing, but at the same time, there's
8146160	8150560	kind of a fine line here, because I think if these guys get too greedy, you know, especially
8150560	8154920	if it's one company over the others, then, you know, they'll be able to still put out
8154920	8159480	a perfectly solid game from, you know, music from other labels that are out there.
8159480	8163880	Well, just look at some other, like, other companies doing similar things.
8163880	8167720	GameStop, and I'm sure this is true for a lot of other retailers as well, they charge
8167720	8170660	companies to put their games in the store.
8170660	8172960	They charge them for shelf space.
8172960	8176920	They actually, when they have, like, signage in their store for a certain game, they make
8176920	8180120	those companies pay for that signage to be in their store.
8180120	8182120	I mean, that's just ridiculous.
8182120	8183900	It's the same thing with this.
8183900	8187040	They're saying, oh, well, our game is, you know, immensely popular, and because of it,
8187040	8188680	your music is becoming more popular.
8188680	8192540	Well, the reason people buy that game in the first place is because of your song list,
8192540	8196920	and if your song list sucks, then people won't buy your game, and then you won't have your
8196920	8200080	popularity.
8200080	8205280	In my mind, both sides stand to lose something if they can't agree on it.
8205280	8209320	And I would say, then, here's what I think it should say the way it is.
8209320	8213920	You're paying royalties, but they're not that big because in the back end, you know, obviously
8213920	8217800	there's a reason why they're licensing their music to these games is because they know
8217800	8223400	the benefit of putting their songs in there, because it does, you know, drive up interest
8223400	8228520	in certain bands and maybe introduce new bands that some people may not have decided to listen
8228520	8229520	to before.
8229520	8230880	I don't know.
8230880	8233800	It's not a bad thing for either company, but as soon as they start getting greedy, that's
8233800	8236200	when it's going to fall apart.
8236200	8241200	SonicM88 in chat says, over at chat.orangelandrater.com, says, I discovered a lot of great songs in
8241200	8242200	the Guitar Hero games.
8242200	8246320	I love playing the game despite the fact that I didn't know most of the songs.
8246320	8249360	So you know, but there are some music game fans that are going to play these games no
8249360	8251840	matter what, even if they don't know a single song in them.
8251840	8255600	But I think certainly part of the reason why Guitar Hero really kind of broke out in some
8255600	8259200	sense is because it was a lot of those songs you've always wanted to play on the guitar.
8259200	8260200	You know what I mean?
8260200	8263400	Plus they did a really good job marketing their game.
8263400	8266320	I think as well, they got it out there in the press.
8266320	8269660	You remember like, you remember when that guy went over to Jamie's house and you guys
8269660	8273560	got interviewed for the news, that was probably because Red Octane put out a press release
8273560	8276280	about the game and was able to kind of call attention to it.
8276280	8277280	You know what I mean?
8277280	8281320	They were very good at getting themselves in the papers and everything.
8281320	8282320	Just kind of a thought.
8282320	8283320	It's also pretty fun.
8283320	8290560	I mean, on top of that, it just seemed to me like there was a much better appreciation,
8290560	8295040	you know, to the gamers themselves that actually wanted to work with the community.
8295040	8296040	Right.
8296040	8298360	Alright, well let's move on with some more news.
8298360	8299360	Okay.
8299360	8306160	Well, um, Ghostbusters game, you know, they were working on the game and Bill Murray did
8306160	8310900	his vocal recording, but he was also quoted as saying that he would be actually, he had
8310900	8316760	such a good time in recording his voice and reprising his character's, you know, his character
8316760	8321160	role that he'd actually like to do another Ghostbusters movie.
8321160	8326480	So, you know, for all those rumors floating around about another Ghostbusters movie, that
8326480	8330940	might actually be a little bit more likely, maybe.
8330940	8331940	We hope.
8331940	8336160	As long as he's not too old for it.
8336160	8337640	Well, we'll see.
8337640	8341680	Maybe he's realizing that some of these other movies he's making aren't exactly as good
8341680	8345800	as, you know, he hasn't exactly been on a big movie streak lately.
8345800	8346800	I don't know.
8346800	8350120	I just couldn't see that Ghostbusters 3 would actually be that big of a movie if they did
8350120	8351120	one.
8351120	8352120	You know what I mean?
8352120	8354760	Maybe a lot of it depends on star power and who they get in the movie, but if they don't
8354760	8358280	have the right people in the movie, I don't know if there'd really be that much interest
8358280	8359440	in a Ghostbusters 3.
8359440	8361120	You know what I mean?
8361120	8364260	Tiger Claw says there is a third Ghostbusters movie in the works that's being written by
8364260	8365260	the writers of The Office.
8365260	8366960	Wasn't that only a rumor?
8366960	8367960	I think that was a rumor.
8367960	8368960	I don't know.
8368960	8369960	Hm.
8369960	8375440	Anyways, there's one of the games that they were talking about at E3 that was Mag, the
8375440	8380780	massive, I don't know, massive action game, I guess, I can't remember what it stood for,
8380780	8385040	but it will apparently be not free to play.
8385040	8393760	They are gonna plan on charging either a yearly or monthly fee, and they'll also have, I guess,
8393760	8397440	one-time fees for content downloads as well.
8397440	8405240	And also, I guess it mentions that they may have hosting partners, like EA and Activision.
8405240	8406240	Hm.
8406240	8413200	But, I don't know, I guess this is sort of, it didn't really seem like an MMO to me, but
8413200	8417320	it is kind of surprising though that an online game like this won't be free to play, but
8417320	8422000	I guess when you have 256 players, you probably need some serious network hardware for that.
8422000	8423000	Hm.
8423000	8424000	I don't know.
8424000	8428280	We'll just hopefully make the game cheap to buy then, if that's the case, you know, like
8428280	8431440	Warhawk or something where it's 40 bucks and it says 60.
8431440	8432440	Yeah.
8432440	8433440	Alright.
8433440	8435920	Well, remember when we used to learn a lot of things from our games?
8435920	8439800	Well, there was a little piece that's been circulating around different gaming blogs
8439800	8440800	this week.
8440800	8445760	It's from the Educational Games Research blog, which kind of puts out information regularly
8445760	8447360	about educational games.
8447360	8451560	They compiled a list this week, the top 10 most influential educational video games from
8451560	8452560	the 1980s.
8452560	8454680	Now, keep in mind, it's just one guy's opinion.
8454680	8460340	It's someone who kind of, I guess, writes about education-related video games, not every
8460340	8462000	now and then, but it's one guy's opinion.
8462000	8464520	This is the top 10 most educational games in his mind.
8464520	8467040	The Oregon Trail, of course, is number one.
8467040	8468320	I mean, who doesn't remember that game?
8468320	8469320	Hello.
8469320	8471360	Because we've all died of dysentery at one time or another.
8471360	8475400	Number two, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, which came up on last week's show, funny
8475400	8476400	enough.
8476400	8478480	Number three, SimCity.
8478480	8479480	Number four, ReaderRabbit.
8479480	8481840	Remember ReaderRabbit?
8481840	8487080	Number five, MathBlaster, which was very similar to ReaderRabbit, or no, no, it weren't that
8487080	8489720	they were similar, but it seems like both those games were kind of like hand-in-hand
8489720	8490720	games.
8490720	8492680	I don't know about you guys, but it seemed like when I was younger, those games kind
8492680	8493760	of were hand-in-hand.
8493760	8496920	Number six, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.
8496920	8499940	Number seven, Lemonade Stand.
8499940	8502400	Number eight, Number Munchers.
8502400	8503780	Number nine, Zork.
8503780	8507580	I don't know if I'd call that an educational game, but I guess maybe because of the fact
8507580	8510200	you actually had to type out your words and thoughts.
8510200	8515120	And number 10, which I find very strange, Windows Solitaire.
8515120	8518900	I guess that's something that you're supposed to, you learn how to use the mouse with it,
8518900	8522600	so it's an educational game, which I can see that, but it's just very odd to see that on
8522600	8523600	this list.
8523600	8528720	And number 11, M-U-L-E, which is strange because it's a top 10 list, but they put Mule on this
8528720	8533080	list as well, which is a great game that I guess, you know, you kind of learn about barter
8533080	8536880	and exchange in that game, but I don't know if I'd call that an educational game either.
8536880	8540760	Of particular interest, why this story kind of piqued my interest, because I've seen this
8540760	8544200	around on different gaming blog sites this week.
8544200	8550080	I tackled this same topic a year ago on my personal blog that I was running for a while
8550080	8553040	back when the All Games Radio Ning site was a little more popular.
8553040	8555160	In fact, I'll link it here in chat.
8555160	8560360	You can actually read my list here, and sorry for those guys that are listening on the podcast,
8560360	8566240	you can't see this, but just go to allgamesradio.ning.com and look for my profile and you'll find this.
8566240	8570400	This was my list of the top 10 edutainment games of all time, because I used to play
8570400	8571920	a lot of them growing up.
8571920	8575680	Number 10, The Incredible Machine, which I've noticed was missing from that list, but I
8575680	8579200	think it's because he was doing a list from the 1980s and I did like an all-encompassing
8579200	8580200	list.
8580200	8583920	But I thought The Incredible Machine was definitely an educational game.
8583920	8589640	Rocky's Boots was number nine on my list because I felt that Rocky's Boots, especially for
8589640	8593680	somebody who's into computers, you learn a lot about logic in this game, which leads
8593680	8596960	to programming, and Rocky's Boots is a hell of a lot of fun.
8596960	8600460	Number eight, it's just Apple logo, because it was kind of like your first programming
8600460	8602520	language that you would learn in school.
8602520	8605460	Number seven, I also put Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.
8605460	8608120	Number six, I also put Math Blasters.
8608120	8612600	Number five, I put a game called Cave of the Word Wizard, that was a game that you had
8612600	8616080	on the Commodore 64, and what made this game notable is that it actually used the Commodore
8616080	8620720	64 speech chip to actually say the names of words that you would have to spell out to
8620720	8625880	the word wizard, where he'd take away your flashlight battery, and then if your battery
8625880	8628960	goes out, you basically die of death.
8628960	8630280	You get eaten alive by bats.
8630280	8633160	No, I don't know, but you don't want your flashlight battery to run out.
8633160	8636960	And I put number four, where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego.
8636960	8642000	Number three, The Island of Dr. Brain, that was a great educational title, again, it wasn't
8642000	8644400	the 80s, that's probably why it wasn't on the other guy's list.
8644400	8648080	And then I put number two, Number Munchers, and number one, The Oregon Trail.
8648080	8653760	So kind of funny that I don't profess to be an educational games expert, yet my list was
8653760	8657040	pretty similar, except for the fact that I had a couple games from the 90s in there.
8657040	8661820	So I don't know, I just thought I'd share that, because nobody read the article when
8661820	8663480	I posted it the first time, so.
8663480	8666480	Where's Leisure Suit Larry?
8666480	8668560	It's not an educational game, Loki.
8668560	8675680	I don't care what you think you learned from it, it is not technically an educational game.
8675680	8679120	And Mae Satsuma is looking at my blog saying, man, did Number Munchers really look that
8679120	8680120	bad?
8680120	8681240	Yes it did, the first version did.
8681240	8684500	They made prettier versions of it as time went on, but the very first version was very
8684500	8687920	plain looking, it was Atari 2600 style graphics.
8687920	8692040	Alright, enough about educational games, let's get back to brain rotting games.
8692040	8696520	Hey, it's not brain rotting, it's just, well, violent.
8696520	8698640	And violence is always good.
8698640	8702360	It helps release tension or something.
8702360	8705960	Well basically, this is some very good news.
8705960	8711640	For all of those people who had always, you know, had the, you must defeat Shen Long to
8711640	8717180	stand a chance and thinking he was a, you know, this was a hidden character or something.
8717180	8725920	Actually Goken, who was supposed to be Ryu and Ken's teacher, is going to be a hidden
8725920	8730000	character in the game, but he's not playable, he's just going to show up every so often
8730000	8732600	and beat the crap out of you.
8732600	8733600	Toasty.
8733600	8742680	But it is, there is an unlock procedure for it, but he's going to be hardcore tough.
8742680	8743680	Sweet.
8743680	8746640	So yeah, that's pretty happy.
8746640	8751080	Of course, you know, I have a feeling that someone's going to find some way to control
8751080	8752320	him, blah blah blah.
8752320	8753960	Or he'll be a download character.
8753960	8756800	Yep, pay to unlock.
8756800	8763080	Well, if it's, you know, if there's going to be another Grand Theft Auto game coming
8763080	8766140	out, then there's got to be another controversy coming with it.
8766140	8769780	And of course, with the announcement of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, and now that more
8769780	8773840	details are leaking out about it, people are throwing a fit.
8773840	8779080	In fact, the British tabloid The Sun, which for some reason is now covering video game
8779080	8789160	stuff every now and then, has a headline called Fury Over Drug Deal Vid Game, and of course
8789160	8796760	includes comments from a guy named Darren Gold of a support group called Drugsline,
8796760	8801200	and anything using drug dealing as entertainment is sending out the wrong message.
8801200	8807680	Glamorism doesn't help our work in trying to educate kids of the dangers of substance
8807680	8809160	misuse.
8809160	8810680	Awesome!
8810680	8811680	And you know what?
8811680	8816580	I agree with you in the fact that kids should be taught about, you know, drugs and how bad
8816580	8817580	they are and stuff.
8817580	8822700	The other thing is kids should be playing this game because it's rated M. So, my God,
8822700	8823700	people please.
8823700	8830200	And in case, if you didn't notice, you can sell drugs in this game because Grand Theft
8830200	8835040	Auto likes to piss people off and controversy sells, so awesome.
8835040	8839240	But remember, parents, the ratings are on the box for a reason.
8839240	8842040	And you know, if you don't really give a shit about the ratings, then do your kids a favor
8842040	8843440	and buy them porn.
8843440	8848360	DJ Dark Knight in chat says, winners don't use drugs.
8848360	8850240	Remember the old FBI warning?
8850240	8853520	Which by the way, have you ever noticed that in, I don't think it's in Rock Band 1, but
8853520	8857660	in Rock Band 2, there's an arcade level that you play in, and you can, if you actually
8857660	8861580	look at the screens, one of them has that little FBI warning on it that says winners
8861580	8862580	don't use drugs.
8862580	8864000	I thought that was pretty awesome.
8864000	8866960	Kudos to whoever at Harmonix snuck that in.
8866960	8869160	Good job, you.
8869160	8873480	Tigerclaw posted a link in chat of some pictures of the drug dealing mini-game.
8873480	8877360	Which is strange because haven't no pictures of this game been released?
8877360	8878360	No, they have been.
8878360	8884960	They were in a game magazine called Game, was it Nintendo Power, yes, I'm sure no one's
8884960	8885960	heard of it.
8885960	8886960	Nice.
8886960	8890280	And it would not be addressed to children at all.
8890280	8892700	No, but seriously though, it's a mature rated game.
8892700	8893700	Come on, folks.
8893700	8896280	I mean, do you really need to know what Grand Theft Auto is?
8896280	8900240	I mean, are you really assuming that it's like Grand Theft Auto babies or something
8900240	8903880	like that because it's coming to the DS that might be friendly for kids?
8903880	8905920	That they're just stealing lunch money or something?
8905920	8907760	I mean, come on.
8907760	8913440	Alright, well, one- It's like saying, oh my god, fire's hot.
8913440	8916500	One more piece of- It is?
8916500	8919160	One more piece of kind of late breaking news for you guys.
8919160	8925480	It's very big rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor, apparently over at an Xbox India event that
8925480	8932280	have happened over in Delhi, India, apparently has been confirmed, I use that term loosely
8932280	8939000	though, that there will be a slim Xbox 360 console that will be released in 2009.
8939000	8942400	This is coming from some Indian gaming blogs.
8942400	8946240	Apparently they are also saying that India is going to be getting some time with Fable
8946240	8951760	2, Gears of War 2, and Fallout 3 a week earlier than supposedly anyone else is supposed to
8951760	8952760	be.
8952760	8953760	Hmm.
8953760	8954760	I'm quite skeptical.
8954760	8957200	Well, they may get to try it a week before it comes out, but big deal.
8957200	8959000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
8959000	8960240	I don't know though.
8960240	8965080	I mean, I guess a redesign of the console makes sense, although they never redesigned
8965080	8966080	the original Xbox.
8966080	8967880	They didn't really let it live its full life either.
8967880	8971040	They kind of rushed the 360 out.
8971040	8973400	By the way, Major Nelson has actually commented on it.
8973400	8978080	He told popular blog Xbox 360 Fanboy that, quote, I have no knowledge of an event in
8978080	8981000	India and therefore anything related to one.
8981000	8985280	I think we all know that if we had something to say, we'd be saying it.
8985280	8986640	Hmm.
8986640	8987720	Very interesting.
8987720	8992080	I think though, I think a redesign of the console will come in the future, but I can't
8992080	8996020	imagine a version of the console where I can't use the same hard drive, or I'd be pretty
8996020	8997020	pissed.
8997020	9000080	I don't know about you guys, I'd be mad if I couldn't plug that same hard drive into
9000080	9001080	a new console.
9001080	9005240	Plus, why would I, I wouldn't even get the new console unless I had something, like let's
9005240	9008680	say it had a digital camera built in, or maybe had music playback.
9008680	9011800	A digital camera built in to a console?
9011800	9014540	Yeah, because a console really uses the camera.
9014540	9016920	By the way, that reminds me, I gotta buy- It was a DS joke.
9016920	9018220	Yeah, I know it was a DS joke.
9018220	9019220	I caught that.
9019220	9020560	Oh my god, really?
9020560	9021920	Was that something we talked about earlier?
9021920	9022920	You know, it was.
9022920	9025000	It was what we call like a loopback joke.
9025000	9026580	I know, that's so crazy.
9026580	9030400	It's like, it's like referring- Have you been paying attention for the past hour?
9030400	9036080	It's like almost like foreshadowing, but in the reverse, backshadowing.
9036080	9038200	Any other smartass comments before I open up the Skype line?
9038200	9043080	No, I was gonna say that more people will need to buy a camera for LittleBigPlanet,
9043080	9047120	I guess, when it comes out, because it uses the Playstation Eye heavily.
9047120	9049840	So are you encouraging people to run out and buy Eye of Judgement so they can get the camera?
9049840	9051080	Fuck no, but it's a waste of money.
9051080	9052880	Buy the camera, it's cheaper.
9052880	9053880	Alright.
9053880	9056400	1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call.
9056400	9061200	We have time for a couple of calls here tonight, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9061200	9062200	That's all one word.
9062200	9063200	You can call us right now.
9063200	9064760	The Skype line is open.
9064760	9066880	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
9066880	9067880	Who's this?
9067880	9068880	Hey, hey, it's Rama.
9068880	9069880	Hey, Rama.
9069880	9070880	How you doing?
9070880	9071880	Pretty good.
9071880	9074840	Tired from this weekend, but other than that, I'm doing alright.
9074840	9079000	So you know, I got pictures on my cell phone from you this weekend, so I know what this
9079000	9080000	means.
9080000	9084840	Rama went to another con, yet again- And I have a surprise, I want you to take a look
9084840	9085840	at this picture.
9085840	9086840	I'll post it in the chat room.
9086840	9087840	Okay.
9087840	9088840	You might call him a con man.
9088840	9090840	No, I'm a con whore.
9090840	9091840	Con whore.
9091840	9094840	Alright, you're the one that called you a whore.
9094840	9095840	I'm looking.
9095840	9096840	Right now?
9096840	9102040	Okay, he's linked me to popular blog Joystiq and a picture in their art gallery of some
9102040	9103960	folks dressed up as Castle Crashers.
9103960	9104960	That's cute.
9104960	9105960	Cute.
9105960	9106960	That's very cute.
9106960	9109440	I was following them for about 20 minutes and I could not get a picture and I kept getting
9109440	9110440	stopped.
9110440	9111440	Why?
9111440	9113400	Were you dressed up as something too?
9113400	9118040	I was dressed as Ranma and people were stopping for my picture half the time.
9118040	9119040	Gotcha.
9119040	9120040	Yeah.
9120040	9122480	That's a very nice, cool little outfit though.
9122480	9124760	Oh, I'm looking at the gallery though at the bottom of this page.
9124760	9126000	There's somebody dressed as Kirby.
9126000	9127000	That looks cute.
9127000	9132160	It's actually somebody tall, but the costume is designed where they can just sit down inside
9132160	9134960	it and roll around, kinda sorta.
9134960	9136240	That's a cute little Kirby.
9136240	9140880	Okay, now while you've got me ogling these pictures of cosplay, I mean, how was the con?
9140880	9144960	And of course, you know, the gaming components of it, were there lots of gaming cosplay at
9144960	9146960	the con?
9146960	9152240	Actually no, and when it comes to gaming, what is this gaming that you speak of?
9152240	9153680	What do you mean?
9153680	9156760	There was only one game at the convention.
9156760	9159760	Wow, what was that?
9159760	9162840	Ubisoft's Naruto 2 for Xbox 360.
9162840	9165760	Of course, because that ties directly back in anime.
9165760	9168960	Yeah, they had like two big screens up for demo play.
9168960	9170760	That was the only game that they had.
9170760	9173280	That's a cool little Kingdom Hearts cosplay.
9173280	9174280	Where's the game room?
9174280	9175520	They're like, what's the game room?
9175520	9176520	I'm like, oh damn.
9176520	9179500	Sorry, I'm looking, I know this is horrible radio, but I'm looking at this Kingdom Hearts
9179500	9181280	cosplay of somebody dressed up as a Heartless.
9181280	9182280	That's pretty awesome, actually.
9182280	9185480	I've seen a few of those running around.
9185480	9189580	So not a lot of gaming content at this convention, is it just because they just want to brandish
9189580	9193000	themselves as strictly, you know, it is an anime festival after all, they just want to
9193000	9194960	be strictly anime and nothing else?
9194960	9196720	No, there's no general rule.
9196720	9198560	I guess it's just, people want it.
9198560	9204020	It was just mostly, I really didn't see a lot of cosplay myself, and I was in the dealer's
9204020	9206520	room in the thicket of it all.
9206520	9209680	That's kind of weird though, because it looks like there was quite a bit of gaming cosplay
9209680	9214560	for a con that didn't really have gaming.
9214560	9215560	Go fig, you know?
9215560	9216560	Oh, that's cool.
9216560	9220800	There's a whole little trio there dressed up like the Whirlins with you, those characters.
9220800	9223000	That's kind of neat.
9223000	9224000	Huh.
9224000	9226000	So, good con?
9226000	9227000	Fun time?
9227000	9230560	It was an improvement over last year's, but it could have been better.
9230560	9233040	I walked in and I'm like, where's the con?
9233040	9237000	I'm like, it's downstairs in the basement, whereas last year, and I'm thinking since
9237000	9242360	there was no digital life, it's going to be upstairs like Comic-Con was, but it wasn't.
9242360	9246320	Oh, this was the convention that goes on the same time as digital life?
9246320	9247320	Yes.
9247320	9251400	Oh, so digital life would have happened this past weekend, had it happened.
9251400	9252400	Yes.
9252400	9253400	Oh, interesting.
9253400	9256680	All right, well, anything else you want to say about the convention before we get some
9256680	9257680	more calls?
9257680	9260800	The only thing that really annoyed me was that you had to pay extra for concerts and
9260800	9261800	autographs.
9261800	9264800	I mean, they get Ominous Autograph with $60.
9264800	9265800	What?
9265800	9267280	That's a little weird.
9267280	9269040	I haven't heard of cons doing that before.
9269040	9270440	They get away with it, though?
9270440	9274840	Yeah, comic book conventions are known for doing it, but not anime conventions, but since
9274840	9279920	I could not get Jamie her autograph, I got her a little gift to really cheer her up,
9279920	9282120	and I'm posting a picture of it in the chat room right now.
9282120	9283120	Okay.
9283120	9287200	I'm going to do one of her all-time favorite movies.
9287200	9289600	I'm going to look right now, too.
9289600	9290600	Ha!
9290600	9292600	That's great.
9292600	9293840	That's great.
9293840	9294840	What is it?
9294840	9295840	Winchester Tavern.
9295840	9298320	Did you see Song of the Dead?
9298320	9300800	Oh my God, okay.
9300800	9301800	Wow.
9301800	9304200	I bought three of those.
9304200	9306040	That is kind of randomly awesome.
9306040	9308040	That is so sweet.
9308040	9311480	Where the hell did you find that at an anime con?
9311480	9314360	It was on a dealer's table with shirts.
9314360	9317160	There's actually a Song of the Dead cosplay now, so why not?
9317160	9321200	Yeah, I saw that at a couple other cons I'd been to.
9321200	9325840	You know they had Song of the Dead on the big screen in San Francisco not that long
9325840	9326840	ago?
9326840	9327840	I was watching Hot Fuzz yesterday.
9327840	9328840	Nice.
9328840	9329840	All right.
9329840	9330840	That's so sweet.
9330840	9331840	Thank you.
9331840	9334960	Well, Rama, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for
9334960	9336920	bringing us to our show.
9336920	9337920	No problem.
9337920	9338920	See you later.
9338920	9339920	Have a good one, buddy.
9339920	9340920	All right.
9340920	9341920	Thank you.
9341920	9343720	I keep forgetting to ask him if he's coming back for Fanime in 2009.
9343720	9344720	I think he said he was, right?
9344720	9345720	Want to hold him to that?
9345720	9346720	I hope so.
9346720	9347720	I hope so too.
9347720	9348720	All right.
9348720	9352240	Orange Lounge Radio, our username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR, if you want to call us the
9352240	9353240	old-fashioned way.
9353240	9355400	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9355400	9356400	Who's this?
9356400	9363080	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land, it is he who likes to whore a bunch of time in live
9363080	9364080	shows and podcasts.
9364080	9367480	I was going to say, you were just on Bobby's show like three hours ago.
9367480	9368480	Yes, yes, yes, it was.
9368480	9369480	No, that's all right.
9369480	9372840	I was asking you to our program, especially with all the work you've done for our show,
9372840	9374640	how could we not have you on the program?
9374640	9376680	You have a good radio voice, now I have something good to say.
9376680	9379100	So what does he want to say tonight, Jason?
9379100	9385840	I was kind of offended by Loki's remarks going, I'm not just whoring time, I'm whoring time
9385840	9388480	about the exact same thing all over again.
9388480	9393280	I have to take some offense to what Loki was saying about favorite studios online and all
9393280	9394280	that nonsense.
9394280	9397200	I'm sorry, say that again?
9397200	9402440	Loki's developers are lazy, fabled to, no online co-op immediately, this, that, and
9402440	9403440	the other.
9403440	9406420	I have to take a little bit of offense to that.
9406420	9408360	Why is that?
9408360	9412360	Developers are not lazy and maybe it's a bit of respect that I'm getting out of the fact
9412360	9420040	that I work at a job that has a lot of developers and when things don't go right and you find
9420040	9424440	out about them, it becomes a losing situation no matter what you try to do.
9424440	9431000	You either cut the feature out, you push the product back, you release it in a hodgepodge
9431000	9435960	and everybody complains and you fix it again.
9435960	9439020	It's no simple matter and developers typically aren't lazy.
9439020	9441440	Lazy developers are the people who make big rigs.
9441440	9445240	Besides that and New World Order, those people don't really exist in the software industry
9445240	9447240	that means anything.
9447240	9455920	What about the fact that this was one of the biggest things that they were pushing in this
9455920	9458080	game and now it's not there anymore?
9458080	9462520	That to me is kind of what makes it, what they're doing here, newsworthy.
9462520	9465480	If it had been just a little feature, I bet most of us wouldn't have blinked an eye at
9465480	9469080	it but this is a pretty big thing that they were selling in the game and now they've just
9469080	9473120	basically said, well it's not really going to be there the first day, sorry.
9473120	9477720	Yeah, and the game was really big and the engine to power it too.
9477720	9481040	You have to have the game before you have the online component.
9481040	9487640	And if they had detrimental lag, rendering issues or anything, I haven't even read into
9487640	9492280	the details but just on a purely, I don't even know what the word is, just on a purely
9492280	9497260	basic level, things don't go perfectly as planned.
9497260	9502720	How long have they had this release date that they're going to make because they're going
9502720	9504920	to finish without this feature?
9504920	9509920	Why not push the release date two weeks back to give us all the features?
9509920	9515240	Basically what it boils down to is there's no right or wrong way to do it but no matter
9515240	9520600	what you do, if you don't have a perfect product and nobody does, if you don't have a perfect
9520600	9524080	product, it's a no-win situation.
9524080	9529200	Something as big as this is definitely worse but it's a no-win situation to the developers
9529200	9535240	who try and try and try and make one of these decisions because they're trying to make things
9535240	9537200	better for their consumers.
9537200	9540200	But there's a lot of times, I mean, and don't get me wrong, I know developers work hard
9540200	9544420	but there's a lot of times that games come out and I'm sure the people actually coding
9544420	9548760	this stuff, yeah, they work hard but I'm wondering about some of those QA stuff because there's
9548760	9555160	a lot of games, especially from certain companies a lot, certain publishers, that are really
9555160	9556440	messed up when they come out.
9556440	9561080	I mean, seriously, there's no way.
9561080	9565320	I mean, and that is who I'm calling lazy.
9565320	9570720	Bigger's new world order, like I said, there are definitely the examples but those people
9570720	9576040	who are that blatant go away never to be heard from again and we laugh them on the way out.
9576040	9580520	Well, not really because I mean look at like EA, a lot of recent sports games have had
9580520	9586420	pretty bad problems in them and Mercenaries 2, I have to keep going back to this but seriously
9586420	9591800	oh my God, there is no way that these glitches, they couldn't have caught this stuff because
9591800	9597000	I run into them so often in this game, anybody playtesting this stuff through would have
9597000	9600080	run into at least a dozen of these each time.
9600080	9603520	Just to say though, sometimes I got to, just in defense of people who QA games because
9603520	9606960	I know we have a lot of them that actually listen to this show, sometimes they find these
9606960	9609780	bugs and they report back and their superiors just don't care.
9609780	9612320	It's kind of one of those things where it's like we don't have the time to fix it.
9612320	9613320	Okay.
9613320	9618960	Well then, either way, it looks bad on the publishing company then.
9618960	9626480	Jason, any other thoughts on this?
9626480	9634280	I have spent my time, I do have to echo SSJ100 Matt though, I did play NHL08, well the demo
9634280	9639700	at least but I'm sure that was indicative enough of the actual game and I had pucks
9639700	9645480	going through the ice and I had a lot of funny things happening, NHL09 has been pretty solid
9645480	9646480	so far.
9646480	9648120	I'm definitely enjoying that.
9648120	9653560	I think it's the first sports game, it's a simulation that I like.
9653560	9656400	Even better than Blades of Steel?
9656400	9658140	Like I said, simulation.
9658140	9663280	Everything else of that age was arcade style but this is actually a sim that I'm thoroughly
9663280	9664280	enjoying.
9664280	9665280	Fair enough, fair enough.
9665280	9667640	Alright well Jason, we're going to let you go so we can try and get one more call but
9667640	9669800	thanks of course for the call and the insight.
9669800	9670800	We appreciate it.
9670800	9671800	Good day.
9671800	9672800	Alright, have a good one.
9672800	9673800	Bye.
9673800	9677560	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,
9677560	9681100	if you'd like to give us a call, we'll probably take like one more call and then call it a
9681100	9685520	night here at Orange Lounge Radio and get to wrapping up the show.
9685520	9688320	Real quick though, while we wait for the call, do we have any last minute stories?
9688320	9692960	This isn't really a story but it was a video that appeared on YouTube but it's now gone
9692960	9693960	on YouTube.
9693960	9699920	GameStop, some of them store their consoles in their bathroom so I hope you like pee on
9699920	9701640	your console.
9701640	9703520	Ew.
9703520	9710040	Well I heard this also from that, was it that Zero, I don't remember, the guy that was mimicking
9710040	9714640	Zero Punctuation but bashing GameStop, he said the same thing about consoles in the
9714640	9719920	bathroom and now they have a video of it and it got taken down off of YouTube apparently.
9719920	9726000	First of all, and I can say this from my experience of being in a number of GameStops in the area,
9726000	9730480	sometimes they're given such little storage space they actually have no choice but to
9730480	9739920	put things in the bathroom but if anyone is urinating or defecating on the console, I
9739920	9748080	would definitely think there'd be a way to tell by the box it's contained in so...
9748080	9750320	What smells in here?
9750320	9752720	Must be something the Sony's putting with the PlayStation.
9752720	9756920	I think there's absolutely no problem with them keeping a console in the bathroom.
9756920	9761400	As long as, you know, it's kept away from the toilet and sink it's fine.
9761400	9764200	They need the storage space, they need the storage space.
9764200	9768840	I just don't understand why a GameStop is a company that can't just, I don't know, spend
9768840	9773120	some of that 7.5 billion dollars that you're making or whatever and maybe...
9773120	9775640	Two words, bottom line.
9775640	9781720	As long as no one's dipping their balls on them, that's the most important thing.
9781720	9783760	Next time I go buy a console and I'm going to wonder...
9783760	9784760	It's a feature, what?
9784760	9787680	Alright, Luke, we've got somebody on hold on the line, I want to get to them.
9787680	9790080	Hi, Aaron, Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9790080	9791960	Hey there, Orange Launch Radio, this is Dekeman.
9791960	9793800	Hey, Dekeman, what's on your mind, buddy?
9793800	9797280	Oh, not a lot, I just wanted to pimp a game that I don't think I've really heard anybody
9797280	9798960	talking about the last couple of weeks.
9798960	9799960	Oh, please, by all means.
9799960	9800960	Uh, DeBlob, for Wii.
9800960	9805280	I don't know if you guys have seen this game, but it's awesome.
9805280	9808320	I've been playing it pretty much all day and it's frickin' fantastic.
9808320	9811920	I know, I saw it at PAX, I watched Loki play it at PAX, actually.
9811920	9814200	You remember the blob game where you were painting the walls different colors?
9814200	9815200	Yeah, it was alright.
9815200	9816200	Yeah?
9816200	9817200	What's makes it...
9817200	9818200	I've just been loving it.
9818200	9819200	It feels like playing Katamari Damacy.
9819200	9823760	I don't know, it just gives me that same feeling of just, you know, just a fun time.
9823760	9826760	Awesome, so that's kind of what makes this game to you?
9826760	9829520	Because keep in mind, we only saw like a few minutes of it at an expo.
9829520	9834000	We can't really form a full opinion on the game based on that, so is it just the fun
9834000	9835000	factor?
9835000	9836000	Yeah.
9836000	9837000	What kind of stuff do you do in this game?
9837000	9838000	What makes it so fun?
9838000	9842200	Basically, you just play as like a gelatinous blob that can take on different colors, and
9842200	9845760	then you roll around the city, and every time you touch a building or an object, it just
9845760	9847400	explodes with color.
9847400	9850520	And you start off in a completely black and white, desolate world, and then you start
9850520	9853560	touching buildings and the whole city just comes to life.
9853560	9858120	It's really quite impressive, especially for a third-party Wii title.
9858120	9860600	That was that one that we saw at PAX, right?
9860600	9862720	Yeah, I don't remember if you were there.
9862720	9864160	I think you were elsewhere on the ship.
9864160	9865160	I was there.
9865160	9866160	Did you?
9866160	9867160	Because I grabbed the little comic book that came out with it.
9867160	9868160	Oh.
9868160	9869160	I thought we were there several times.
9869160	9870160	That was lots of fun.
9870160	9871160	I really enjoyed it in that one.
9871160	9872160	Oh, it is.
9872160	9873160	It's fantastic.
9873160	9874160	Hmm.
9874160	9876760	So you literally get to paint the town red, as Frisbee says in chat.
9876760	9879200	Yeah, pretty much.
9879200	9880200	It's great.
9880200	9881200	Seriously, check it out if you get the chance.
9881200	9882200	Nice.
9882200	9883200	Okay.
9883200	9884200	Well, we might have to check that out.
9884200	9885200	Is it only on Wii?
9885200	9886200	Or did they put it on other systems?
9886200	9889440	No, it's only on Wii, but like I said, it is easily the best third-party Wii title I've
9889440	9890440	ever seen.
9890440	9891440	Huh.
9891440	9892440	Very cool.
9892440	9893440	Yeah.
9893440	9894440	What did you play with us?
9894440	9896440	Uh, Samba de Amigo for the Wii.
9896440	9897440	Ah.
9897440	9900360	How did that turn out?
9900360	9901360	What's that?
9901360	9902360	How did that game turn out?
9902360	9904440	Because I'd be curious to pick it up, but there's just so much other stuff I'm playing
9904440	9905440	right now.
9905440	9906440	I haven't had a chance.
9906440	9907920	The controls are kind of here and there.
9907920	9911120	They could really touch you, but I think that once you play with it for a couple of hours,
9911120	9914840	you really get the idea of how to control the game, but that's really the only problem
9914840	9915840	I've had with it.
9915840	9920360	The track list is fantastic, so yeah, I'm enjoying it.
9920360	9921360	Very cool.
9921360	9922360	Huh.
9922360	9923360	All right.
9923360	9924360	Well.
9924360	9925360	Okay.
9925360	9926360	Well.
9926360	9929800	Oh, have you had fun posing in Samba de Amigo?
9929800	9930800	That's the most important part.
9930800	9931800	Oh, yeah.
9931800	9933800	In the hustle mode?
9933800	9934800	Fantastic.
9934800	9936000	They really beefed it up.
9936000	9938240	I'll play that mode more than the regular mode.
9938240	9939240	Awesome.
9939240	9940240	All right.
9940240	9941240	Well, thanks so much for the call, Dekeman.
9941240	9942240	We've got to go and wrap up the show.
9942240	9943240	Yep.
9943240	9944240	No worries.
9944240	9945240	Take care, guys.
9945240	9946240	Have a good one.
9946240	9947240	You too.
9947240	9948240	Bye.
9948240	9949240	I don't remember Dekeman calling in before.
9949240	9952140	Maybe once a long time ago, but I know he's been in the chat room a lot for our program,
9952140	9953560	so that's good to hear from him.
9953560	9954560	All right.
9954560	9955560	We're going to shut the Skype line down.
9955560	9956560	Sorry, folks.
9956560	9958440	We're going to start to wrap up the show here, but I want to make sure we got all our last
9958440	9963120	minute stories out of the way.
9963120	9964120	That's all I have.
9964120	9965120	Huh?
9965120	9966120	Dark Sakura?
9966120	9968720	My last minute story is I like pie.
9968720	9970320	That's not a story.
9970320	9971320	Wait.
9971320	9972320	I do have one more.
9972320	9977000	Remember I talked about last week the Wii ISO loader that got leaked out, and then the
9977000	9983440	guy making it when it, oh, looks like a wheny cocoa or something like that, wheny cocoa.
9983440	9989320	You know, basically he was pissed off about the leak or something like that, and so he's
9989320	9994880	like, well, you know, I'm not going to work on it anymore, and then later on the week,
9994880	9996920	well, maybe I'll work on some more.
9996920	9998920	Well, I missed the attention, so.
9998920	10003160	Yeah, maybe I'll finish it now, so.
10003160	10006120	So yeah, ISO loader may be coming at some point.
10006120	10011280	Okay, well, if there's no other last minute stories, then we're going to go ahead and
10011280	10014840	go around and get everybody's final thought and try to wrap up tonight's show.
10014840	10015840	We'll start off with Tiara.
10015840	10017400	Thanks so much for joining us here tonight.
10017400	10022080	I hope you had fun, and do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
10022080	10023080	No.
10023080	10024080	No.
10024080	10026080	Just a simple no.
10026080	10028720	We'll have a safe flight back to Las Vegas and come see us again.
10028720	10029720	I definitely will.
10029720	10030720	Thank you.
10030720	10031720	Awesome.
10031720	10032720	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10032720	10037600	My final thought is I went this weekend and played Airsoft, and it was fun, so my gun
10037600	10042720	I have, the P90 or whatever, I have these 300 round clips, and I hated having to run
10042720	10049360	out of ammo and change clips and stuff, it's just so inconvenient, so I bought a 1500 round
10049360	10051320	box magazine for it now.
10051320	10053200	I will never run out of ammo.
10053200	10054200	Ever.
10054200	10055200	Goody goody.
10055200	10057400	Just don't bring that to the studio.
10057400	10059960	I will bring it to the studio one of these days.
10059960	10060960	No.
10060960	10065080	I'm just gonna get shot, especially if another dance hero, which I'm surprised, did not come
10065080	10069740	up on Skype tonight, the dance hero thing, maybe next week, maybe we'll get some emails.
10069740	10075280	My final thought would be I had a bite of John's Chinese food and it was really good.
10075280	10081160	It was really good, because I haven't had deep fried chicken in a long time.
10081160	10084720	And a nice little humanized Mega Man picture there that Dark Soccer is showing me.
10084720	10086480	This is gonna be my final thought when...
10086480	10087480	Oh, what?
10087480	10088920	Okay, then what is your final thought?
10088920	10091880	Someone needs to go look at Masao's artwork.
10091880	10104560	It's at www.5c.biglobe.ne.jp slash tilde kure kure kure kure slash index.htm.
10104560	10105800	You are gonna post that in chat, right?
10105800	10106800	I am.
10106800	10107800	That's a long ass link.
10107800	10113280	It's basically this guy that does weird video game art and kind of scary Ronald McDonald
10113280	10117760	art, but he does Mario and Luigi.
10117760	10119720	I'm interested in the scary Ronald McDonald art.
10119720	10120720	Me too, I might have to look at this.
10120720	10122720	But the artist is Masao, M-A-S-A-O.
10122720	10123720	Alright.
10123720	10125720	Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
10125720	10128520	Well if you didn't have a pen and paper to write down that link fast enough, and sadly
10128520	10131640	you weren't in chat tonight, you should come join us for a live show sometime.
