00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, September 7th, 2008, we take some time to decompress after Penny Arcade Expo,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Luminous makes its way to yet another platform,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and could a new Kingdom Hearts game be showing at Tokyo Game Show?

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We weren't here last week because, you know, we were at Penny Arcade Expo, that would be myself, Rob Roberts,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hi!

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But we are back this week, are we not?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes we are.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So to do another podcast for you lovely people out there.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The tape's live on Sunday nights over AllGames.com.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But not joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki!

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're joined instead by your laundry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes, my laundry is instead sitting in the chair that Loki usually does, because, you know, we tape at my house.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But, very interesting, the wife was so mad that he went to Penny Arcade Expo, she killed him.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So he's not here tonight, nor will he ever be back.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
She's replaced him with Rob's laundry.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes. No, just kidding of course.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He's away at a thing for his day job today that he had to go to, so he won't be here tonight.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But he'll be back next week, as we all will.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And we have no guests tonight either, it's just the lovely DarkSakura, myself, feeling the love with all you kids from our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And we have some stuff there in chat.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Gsquared68 says, Orange Laundry Mower Radio.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I tried to get Dan to come tonight.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah?

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What was his excuse?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He had to work.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Aw, bummer.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, weren't you telling me that Dan, you know, gosh, he's so, so just worked and worn out, he was playing Street Fighter IV this week or something?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It was at the Game Crazy Manager Conference.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They either had it there or he went to an arcade that had one, but he played Street Fighter IV and said that it was pretty good but the jumping was weird.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hmm.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He looks very slick from what I've seen. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on it.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He said he played like any Street Fighter.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Nice.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Very excited.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Of course, that's not the one I'm excited about.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you excited about?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Freaking Capcom vs. Tatsunoko.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I had a feeling.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Any particular reason?

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Gotcha, mon!

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, yeah.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Gotcha, mon.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And Dan's like, it doesn't, it doesn't have Joe in it.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I was like, but it has Ken and it has Hurricane Polymer and Kashawn, so it's all cool.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Alright, very nice.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And Tekamon.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Gsquared68 is also mentioning in our chatroom, San Jose State has it, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump from us, so maybe we have to take a road trip at some point.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That would be cool.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That would be fun.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A little OLR road trip as if Seattle wasn't fun enough.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Speaking of Seattle, Penny Arcade Expo, you know, unfortunately we did not get to do our own show just due to some technical difficulties, but we contributed to...

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Shut up.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, no, no, no, no.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Due to, I'm going to come clean on this one.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Alright.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:21,000
When we were going to be doing a show, Jamie instead passed out, while I managed to pass out over a conversation, so that meant that we had no show Saturday night.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, technical difficulties.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We'll just leave it at that.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Host difficulties.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Doesn't technical difficulties sound better than host malfunction?

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I had technical difficulties with my ability to stay awake.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Jamie has a walking technical difficulty, actually.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You know what, Rob?

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But, no, we had a lot of fun at PAX.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It was OLR bonding.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It was fantastic.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And some Bobby bonding as well.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And some hatred of the western internet.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, the western internet was sucky.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And some bonding with our listeners.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We had some great, we had just a wonderful turnout from the All Games Network.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Such an experience with that super glue and duct tape, I swear.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The Penny Arcade Expo you never hope to experience.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But, no, we all went out for a real nice dinner one night with ourselves.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Some of the other All Games hosts were there, like Loserleaf and Deadpix Alive went with us and some of the other folks like Rob Dee who did this day in gaming, I think it was called.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And it's been too long.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And just a bunch of listeners came with us out to dinner one night.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was fantastic.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We had a great time.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We had really good food on top of it.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, absolutely.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So, good times.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Black Wolf is clarifying in chat there was no bondage.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know where that came from.

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I think some of our chatters are going there.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I just said bonding.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Literally, you know.

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Bonding.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It was that episode.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, I'm just kidding.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Anyhow.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Alright, so how was your Penny Arcade Expo Dark Soccer?

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I know we usually start with how was your gaming week, but seeing as Penny Arcade Expo was such a...

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We'll get to gaming week post packs later.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How was your Penny Arcade Expo?

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What kind of stuff did you see at the show that you enjoyed?

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Walk us through your time at Penny Arcade Expo a little bit.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, I was in a daze, you know, that Friday because I was just all like pretty shiny.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Namco.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hang out with Namco for an hour.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You know, and they were just selling stuff, but I was like, dude, I don't care because it's Namco.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And I went in a Dig Dug plushie and couldn't get one.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Did you miss the memo that Namco hates us?

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Katamari?

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Remember that?

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Ah, forget it.

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So?

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm kidding.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I love Namco.

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I worked for them, sort of, at the arcade.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But at any rate, actually, you know, we did the rounds of the room when it was press only

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and that was pretty cool.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I liked that it was very relaxed, at least for those few hours.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I saw things that I liked.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I didn't play too much just because I was mostly observing and I could get a feel for

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
it just by watching people.

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I played a few things myself.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I really, really like Little Big Planet.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I thought that was pretty cool.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I liked what I saw of Spore.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We're probably going to get it eventually.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't really have much time to play it, so it's whenever Dan gets it.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I actually liked Wii Music because I thought that it was just neat.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I thought that, you know, and I like, I'm one of those people who likes finding, you

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
know, MIDI programs and then redoing all the instruments in the MIDI to sound completely

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
bizarre.

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, actually, one of the things that I liked about Wii Music is that it just had that playing

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
with MIDI tones type of thing to it.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Animal Crossing, it was Animal Crossing.

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I really liked the Wario game.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That one was kind of cool.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I went over to hang out with, okay, was it EA?

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, it wasn't EA.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
EA had some of the crap.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Just so you know, Bobby just disowned you because you like Wii Music.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I didn't say that I was going to play it.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just thought it was neat.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You know, this comes from my old, you know, old, what was my third major?

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Music major, right?

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So, I think I'm on major number 12 now.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I would be all over Wii Music if I was 12.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, I thought it was neat.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I thought it was, it would be something that would be fun to waste some time with, I thought.

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
At any rate.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I gotta say this.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Black Wolf just said, I liked and Wii Music do not belong in the same sentence unless

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
in the context of I liked to hate on Wii Music.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You know, I think we said this in an earlier show when we first talked about Wii Music.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If it gets kids into real music, it's a good thing, regardless.

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
See, that's what I think.

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's a great platform, you know, into learning a bit more.

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I mean, because really it teaches tempo.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It teaches a little bit of arrangement.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I thought, you know, I thought it's a neat little concept.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You know, I would have totally loved to have something like this when I was little.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I played Mario Paint, you know, but at any rate, moving forward.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I also liked talking with the guy that they interviewed for Guitar Hero.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He was pretty cool, and I'm really, really looking forward to the studio mode.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I mean, really looking forward to the studio mode, and I was reminded of that by thinking

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
of Mario Paint.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You know, people making their own music and everything.

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think it would be fantastic.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm really, really looking forward to that.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I played the game that I always forget the name of that you play as a sushi plate.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm going to get the name of it off of my phone again just because I took a picture

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
because I could not remember the name of it because it was so bizarre.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Sushi Bumper Sumo Fun Game.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And as I was saying earlier when Bobby called in, you play as a sushi plate,

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and you have to keep the other piece of sushi away from the others,

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and they can knock you into the conveyor belt, and you lose a piece of sushi.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And whoever holds onto the sushi for the longest time within two minutes

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
gets a higher score and wins.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's basically keep away with sushi.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And it was a really fun, weird little game, and from what I understand,

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
it's supposed to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, so I'm looking forward to that.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I really, really wish I had ear plugs for all the people who couldn't sing

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that were playing rock band and guitar hero because, I mean,

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you've got a bar telling you when you're out of tune

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you should actually pay attention to it.

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know if I've said so before on the show, but I hear Perfect Pitch,

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
which drove me nuts in band, but I really can't filter out.

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's why I don't like to sing in front of people because I can hear it in myself.

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's why I don't sing.

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
At any rate, other stuff that I saw that was really cool was Pink Godzilla

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
because I bought stuff from Pink Godzilla.

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
For anyone who doesn't know, my anniversary was on the 1st.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Dan and I have been married for three years,

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and I bought him his anniversary present from Pink Godzilla.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I got him a salamander pack for a PSP.

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's nerd love right there.

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That is nerd love.

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, he got me an iPod that he got for free.

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He regifted? He regifted for your anniversary?

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's fine. I don't care.

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
At least it's an iPod.

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's a little in red, and it says the GameStop special edition or some shit on it.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But anyway, other fun stuff.

206
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I liked hanging out with the Commando 3 people.

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They were kind of cool.

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Actually, they were really cool.

209
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I actually went to talk to some of the digital design students.

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You can't do this in Wii music, but you can do it in Mario Paint.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's actually a pretty decent little arrangement.

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Where's my bucket so I can roll it at you?

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Sorry. Couldn't resist.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Anyway.

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Wii music will never have the greatness of the Mario Paint.

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Mario Paint was fantastic.

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We need Mario Paint, the sequel.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Mario Paint 2, Electric Boogaloo.

219
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Other stuff that I saw slash played or did.

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I was mentioning, I was talking to a lot of the digital design schools that try to get people to sign up for their schools.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They really actually got a lot of good tips for myself as far as things to study in my current major.

222
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They were all like, we'd prefer you to go to our school.

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But there's a few of them that were actually beginning transfer programs.

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's kind of looking into. There's one in Sunnyvale.

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And that would just be really cool because then I'd be close to Capcom's testing grounds and that would be sweet.

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Also, trying out all the fun restaurants.

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Going to Gameworks, which was oddly disappointing because I couldn't win that Tales out of the Crane game.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And there was an incredible, incredible lack of Planet Harriers.

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So I wanted to cry in sub-tears of disappointment for having no Planet Harrier.

230
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Because Planet Harrier is one of the greatest arcade games ever. Ever.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What? Rob's looking like he's up to something, everybody.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, they just wanted to link to the YouTube and chat.

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So I just put it in there in true Mario Paint Roll fashion.

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I put, dude, this YouTube is so cool and then put the link.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So we'll see how many people click it.

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, I also played, actually I was very surprised about how much I liked it.

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I played the Ninja Gaiden demo on DS.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And it was really, really cool, but there was another DS demo that actually was really freaking fun.

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And that was the Arkanoid demo.

240
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I used to play Arkanoid back in the day on the old, you know, Gamebrick.

241
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The old Gameboy. And that was pretty fun.

242
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I saw people playing WonderSwan and I wished I had brought my WonderSwan.

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, I wish I had brought mine too.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh, I would have had a WonderSwan party.

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That would have been great.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It would have been wonderful.

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I saw a couple Neo Geo Pocket colors and I, you know, I had actually come this close.

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And for anyone not looking, it's about a millimeter, my fingers are apart, from bringing my Turbo Express.

249
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Because actually I saw someone playing a Duo LT.

250
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
For anyone who doesn't know, the Duo LT is freaking expensive!

251
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Expensive!

252
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's something awesome to bring to the handheld lounge at Penny Arcade Expo.

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because usually it's, you know, DSes, a few PSPs.

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But to bring like a freaking, you know, portable Neo Geo would be awesome.

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, the Duo LT, and I'll find a Wikipedia page to link to everybody.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Basically it's the Turbo Graphics Duo laptop.

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Which had its own little screen and everything.

258
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Really freaking expensive.

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I saw someone who had one.

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And then I got to meet my musical hero, Jonathan Coulton.

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I got to meet my geek hero, Wil Wheaton.

262
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Good times.

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And I had a fan-gasm both times.

264
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So you had a great PAX, it sounds like.

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hell yeah!

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How did it compare to the E3 of old that we used to go to?

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Because a lot of people were saying, PAX is the new E3!

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No, PAX is not the new E3.

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Imagine, and it's like I kept wanting to call it a con.

270
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Because it felt like going to a freaking convention.

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I mean, like, the show floor or whatever was like half dealer's room anyway.

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And it was just really fun.

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There were the free game panels, there were movies, there were performances.

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This wasn't like E3, this was a freaking convention.

275
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's what this was.

276
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This wasn't...

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
E3 is a media, you know, spectacle, I should say.

278
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
PAX is, it's like an anime con, but just video games.

279
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I would like to say to all of you folks that went to Penny Arcade Expo,

280
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm quite proud of the majority of you for knowing how to bathe properly.

281
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I know!

282
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It was actually a pretty pleasant smelling.

283
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I mean, don't get me wrong, there were a few people that smelled like fart.

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But some people, the most people...

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's the gym sock syndrome.

286
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You can tell who's been sleeping in the lounge.

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Most people were very well bathed, and I appreciate it.

288
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And all the All Games people were well, well bathed.

289
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So thank you all.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I really, I just really had a good time.

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know what, it felt a lot...

292
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Except for DMN.

293
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Dirty bastard.

294
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It felt a lot like going to Fauna Mae.

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Is that the impression that you got?

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Kinda.

297
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was really laid back.

298
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But it was All Games, so I felt like I understood it.

299
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I felt like it was...

300
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It was the most of Fauna Mae.

301
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And on top of that, I thought that it was very well organized

302
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
as far as getting into some of the events,

303
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
though I didn't go to the one event I wanted to go to.

304
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, that and the Nerdcore Rising.

305
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I got to see MC Frontalot, but I didn't mind anything from him.

306
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh well.

307
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Anyway, but it was just really, I thought, well organized

308
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and how they had everything together.

309
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And it gave everybody a fair opportunity.

310
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So that was even what impressed me a whole lot more.

311
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That and there was some cosplay.

312
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh my God.

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It was very convention-like.

314
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Except there was some really shitty cosplay.

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And whoever that was who cosplayed the bride

316
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
who wasn't wearing underwear, you need to eat a steak, girl.

317
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I could see...

319
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
When you can see someone's pelvic bones, their hips,

320
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
no, that's the sign that somebody needs to freaking sit down

321
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
with a porterhouse and chow down.

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Sorry.

323
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And nobody wants to see your ass.

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Thank you.

325
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
All right.

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll try to keep my pack stuff short.

327
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I mean, Jamie hit on most of it.

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I had a lot of fun broadcasting with the All Games crew.

329
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You know, the seven or eight hours we were doing it.

330
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And just getting to meet people and hang out with people.

331
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You know, the show four kind of came and went.

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thank God we got to go in there a little bit early

333
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and kind of take everything in and actually get to play things.

334
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
To kind of echo some of the games,

335
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Dark Sakura talked about Wii music.

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm still not as huge of a fan of.

337
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But again, if I look at it from the angle of a seven-year-old

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
might play this game and decide they want to play real drums,

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm okay with it.

340
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But me, I'm not going to buy it.

341
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Animal Crossing has the potential to be neat or really, really stale.

342
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And right now it's feeling a little stale.

343
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So I just really hope the internet functionality is built in there

344
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
the way we're all dreaming of

345
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
because that's going to be what saves this game.

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The Wario Land game was great too.

347
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But, you know, obviously that's something we've kind of already seen here in studio

348
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
if you've been paying attention on the last few episodes.

349
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
As far as other stuff that Jamie didn't talk about

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
because I don't think it's quite up her alley,

351
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Warhammer Online I got to check out a little bit.

352
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We had a booth set up there.

353
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And, you know, the folks behind Warhammer Online

354
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
are very adamant that we're not WoW, we're not WoW, we're not trying to be WoW.

355
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
WoW is, you know, the Beatles and we're Led Zeppelin and all this stuff,

356
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
which is cool.

357
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But the demo that they had there was leveling up the first few levels

358
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
like starting a new character.

359
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I felt that when you were starting a new character

360
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it kind of played like WoW to me, which isn't a bad thing.

361
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
WoW is a great formula.

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And, you know, it has slightly nicer graphics

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and it, you know, kind of tracks your quests a little differently.

364
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And, of course, naturally you have different classes, different races.

365
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So it's not the exact same as WoW.

366
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But I just would have liked to have seen a little more on the floor.

367
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I understand they showed some of this in panels,

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
but, you know, those were impossible to get into without waiting forever.

369
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I would like to see a little more how the Realm vs. Realm combat works

370
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
because I feel like I only kind of partially understand it from what I heard.

371
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So I'm looking forward to seeing more of that.

372
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And I realized, yeah, I could go online, look at more of that stuff.

373
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But I was just kind of hoping to see that on the show floor,

374
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
especially when they're trying to really differentiate themselves.

375
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But I had fun with the game. That's what's important, right?

376
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'll probably pick it up.

377
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
LittleBigPlanet. Loved it. Loved it. Game of the show for me, honestly.

378
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I was very surprised at just really how good Sony's booth was,

379
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
all things considered.

380
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I actually thought the games Sony was showing

381
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
was probably better than the stuff Nintendo was showing on a whole.

382
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Although, I don't know, the Wario Land game was pretty awesome, too.

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But I just really liked LittleBigPlanet

384
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and I never realized the party game potential that this game has.

385
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And the editor looks great. I'm definitely interested in this game.

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
As well, some of the other things Sony was showing, not bad.

387
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You know, MotorStorm 2 looked pretty interesting

388
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and they were showing off the new SingStar and Buzz throughout the day.

389
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
SingStar looked fun. I didn't get a chance to play it, though.

390
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You know, I was kind of impressed by Sony.

391
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
They're really starting to redeem themselves a little bit, I think.

392
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Also, other games I played, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
kind of surprised me being on the show floor.

394
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And Dark Soccer and I actually did play a round of that.

395
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I played Katana. She played Catwoman.

396
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, yeah, that's right. We did play that. It was fun!

397
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It was kind of fun.

398
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You know, I said this when I was trying to summarize the show in my Live Journal.

399
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's never going to be as great as Marvel vs. Capcom.

400
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You know, and Mortal Kombat has always been a little bit of a,

401
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't know, not so serious, at least to me,

402
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
especially in any Mortal Kombat game since 2.

403
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It just played so much like the others.

404
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, it's not like a real hardcore fighting game.

405
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's more of a game that seems to not take itself so seriously,

406
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
at least in my mind. You know what I mean?

407
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And I think the trend continues here with DC Universe.

408
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You really are just kind of taking out Mortal Kombat characters

409
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and putting in DC Universe characters instead, but it's the same engine.

410
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I don't think it's a game anyone's going to remember years from now

411
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
that they have such praise on, but was it a lot of big dumb fun?

412
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah! I think it's going to be a fun game that a lot of college dorm kids are going to eat up.

413
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Catwoman's attack was totally like the blood rain attack except she used her claws.

414
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah. Very cool.

415
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Oh! One thing I forgot, if you don't mind.

416
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Sure, go ahead.

417
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I played D&D 4th edition like a big freaking nerd.

418
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You are a big nerd.

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It was great.

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And then let's see, there's another game at PAX.

421
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Puzzle Quest Galactrix, I'll say really quickly I got to play a little bit of.

422
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They had that playable on the show floor.

423
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And you just have to really think it's not like Bejeweled anymore.

424
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I mean, it is, but now it's on a hexagon, which completely changes the way you have to think about the game.

425
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But I enjoy myself with that game.

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I just hope it's not too...

427
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I mean, well, I'm kind of thinking, you know, I hope it's not too much of the same,

428
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
but they really did try to mix it up with, you know, putting it on the hexagon

429
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and kind of giving it the space theme.

430
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I think it'll be kind of cool.

431
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I was very disappointed though that they were showing a trailer for Star Trek Online on the floor,

432
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
but not any actual gameplay.

433
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That didn't make me disappointed.

434
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That made my heart hurt because I'm totally going to play that.

435
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, me too.

436
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I was hoping to see a little more on that.

437
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But I understand.

438
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's early.

439
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's early.

440
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm not hating.

441
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's just, you know, it got my hopes up only to be crushed by disappointment.

442
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And one more game I'll mention, the Iron Chef game I played.

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I avoided it.

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's not as horrible as you'd think.

445
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I hear it's only a $20 game, which might not be bad.

446
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Iron Chef America is crap.

447
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It is, but it plays like Cooking Mama.

448
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But actually responsive.

449
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Because Cooking Mama on the Wii was pretty atrocious.

450
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But Iron Chef felt okay.

451
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't think it's going to have any real long-term playability.

452
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But if it's only $20, that's how much a lot of arcade titles are.

453
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think it'll be a lot of big, dumb fun.

454
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I did like how you could garnish your plate.

455
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That was kind of fun.

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I like that.

457
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Well, I guess part of it is presentation.

458
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah.

459
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah, it is cool.

460
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm looking at comments from chat.

461
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The Rob D. says, Iron Mama, in a way.

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Let's see.

463
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm looking at other comments from chat here.

464
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com, if you want to add some things to the chat.

465
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I can't say this name.

466
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
K-H-A-S-N, Kossen.

467
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't know if that's how you say it.

468
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The game looks bad.

469
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The graphics aren't stellar, but it is on the Wii, which, you know,

470
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
doesn't really do the high-def stuff so well.

471
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
A game is only...

472
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Games...

473
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Play it first.

474
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
A game with crappy graphics can still be fun.

475
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Look at the old Atari 2600 games.

476
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Unless it's E.T.

477
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Again, it's not going to be anything you're going to remember for a lifetime,

478
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
but for 20 bucks, it's a good waste of time.

479
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I guess that's all I really want to say about PAX.

480
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
How was your gaming week?

481
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll talk some more about the whole PAX broadcast and all that

482
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
in just a little bit when we get to housekeeping.

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I do want to say, though, how was your gaming week after PAX?

484
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Did you play anything post-Pax that you want to talk about?

485
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, Ragnarok.

486
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And I played a stellar game of Black Knight 2000 pinball.

487
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
For the record, we are selling our Black Knight 2000 pinball.

488
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Oh, are you disappointed about that, or is it time?

489
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We want a little bit better playfield.

490
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh, okay.

491
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
We're also selling our Star Trek The Next Generation pinball.

492
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Because, again, we want a better table.

493
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Alright, well, as long as you get it back, because I love Next Generation.

494
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And any listener who is willing to trade across the board,

495
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
we will trade our Creature from the Black Lagoon for a Lord of the Rings pinball, please.

496
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm making a mention on behalf of my husband,

497
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
because I really don't care for Creature from the Black Lagoon, anyway.

498
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But, no, I did play a lot of...

499
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I actually did play a lot of Solitaire, just because I have that kind of time,

500
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
which is not really...

501
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So, that's about it.

502
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm in school, so it's not like I have time to really do a lot of playing.

503
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That's cool.

504
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I played a lot of Rock Band and Guitar Hero this week.

505
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I went back to kind of milk the last little bit out of those games that I'm going to

506
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
before the new sequels come out,

507
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
because we're only a few days away from Guitar Hero World Tour

508
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and Rock Band 2 coming out,

509
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
so I'm just kind of squeezing the last little bit out of those games,

510
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
because, yeah, I plan to export the Rock Band tracks and then get rid of the game.

511
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I mean, even if I only get a few bucks for it, I'll take it,

512
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
because I don't really plan to play it much longer.

513
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But I'll tell you what bugs me about Rock Band.

514
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You freaking people that play online matches,

515
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
like in score battle or what have you,

516
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and then when I'm beating you,

517
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and I'm about to win the song with like 20,000 points over you,

518
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
you freaking quit, so I don't get credit for the song.

519
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I hate that.

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I have been leaving negative feedback, though, on people to do that,

521
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
because that pisses me off, and I encourage people to do that.

522
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Don't forget, like, if people quit early,

523
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
because they can't suck it up that someone beat them at the game,

524
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
freaking leave them a negative review so it does affect their little score,

525
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
because I think that is such bullcrap.

526
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And Rock Band should automatically register that as a loss,

527
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but for whatever reason they didn't think to do that,

528
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and it doesn't, so it just kind of ticked me off.

529
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And Black Wolf is correcting me in chat saying,

530
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
World Tour doesn't come out until October 26th.

531
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, I'm thinking of Rock Band, though.

532
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Rock Band is just a few more days.

533
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I did actually have another edition of my gaming week.

534
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I received a game.

535
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
My wonderful husband has finally brought me home.

536
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The world ends with you, so I'm going to be playing that.

537
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh, cool.

538
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Finally!

539
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
When you beat that, I want to borrow it.

540
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm going to go and check that out.

541
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You will be first in line.

542
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Ssj100matt in chat, chat.orangessauceredo.com,

543
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
says, I leave negative feedback all the time.

544
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You know, and I'm also a believer in positive feedback, too.

545
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You know, if you actually chat with somebody and they're not going,

546
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
you know, cock, cock, fag, fag, you know,

547
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
all that stuff that people do on Xbox Live,

548
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I think if, you know, there's decent people,

549
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
you should leave positive feedback so you play with them again.

550
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I've done that, too.

551
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I think not enough people are using that system,

552
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and it's our way to kind of filter out the a-holes,

553
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
so you definitely should make use of that.

554
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Don't forget that that feature's there to you,

555
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and if you don't know how to use it,

556
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
just hit your little guide button after you play a match with someone,

557
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and go to the option that's not your friends list or your messages,

558
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but it's all the way on the right side.

559
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It'll show you, like, the last 100 people you've played a game with,

560
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and so you can just click on the Personally Feedback right there.

561
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's awesome.

562
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
There you go.

563
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This person sucks ass.

564
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah, sadly, you can't filter down that good,

565
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
but you can leave the reason why you're putting them on your frown list.

566
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
There's a smile list and a frown list,

567
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and if you want to mark their frown because they quit early,

568
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
you can do that,

569
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and so I've done that for you rock band fools.

570
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm going to start reading names on the show

571
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
of gamertags that have quit out on me.

572
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Do it.

573
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm going to.

574
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
In fact, I'll look up the name while you're reading the next story

575
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and call them out here on the program.

576
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That'll be fun.

577
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I do want to say, though,

578
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
as far as other games I've been playing this week,

579
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
you know, besides usual World of Warcraft,

580
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I did pick up Spore.

581
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I have the box sitting right here.

582
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm excited, but I'm hoping the hype hasn't killed this game

583
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
because I'm hearing a lot of people are thinking this was not worth the wait,

584
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
but I don't know.

585
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
We'll see.

586
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We'll see.

587
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm going to hold off on my opinion until I get a chance to play it myself.

588
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I do have the box sitting right here.

589
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm going to install that after the show tonight.

590
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I just didn't have time to get around to it today.

591
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Go ahead.

592
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
What?

593
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Xbox Live Arcade.

594
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I checked out Gin Rummy.

595
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The presentation of that game is actually really nice.

596
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I just wish there was more to it than just Gin Rummy

597
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
because I think there's, you know,

598
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Sierra, our masters, doing card games on the computer and such,

599
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
so it's kind of nice to see them getting into it on Xbox Live Arcade.

600
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I just wish there had been a little more to it,

601
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and I just didn't feel like the price justified it

602
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
because I know this sounds harsh, but I could get a real deck of cards.

603
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Then again, I could say the same thing about Uno,

604
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
but yet Uno is so much fun on Xbox Live.

605
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I can't explain what it is, the difference.

606
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Maybe, I don't know, maybe it's the fact more people are on Uno

607
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
or that Uno is so disgustingly simple

608
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and you can literally just sit down and play for five minutes

609
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and Rummy takes a little more time.

610
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't know.

611
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
How about Rock Band Stuff?

612
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
How about Rock Band Stuff?

613
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
There is actually a Rock Band two-track list

614
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
that is ranked by difficulty for Xbox 360.

615
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Hold on, hold on, we're not in Stories yet. Hold on, sorry.

616
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you already did yours.

617
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No, no, no, no.

618
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't know why I'm...

619
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I've got to get to housekeeping.

620
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You know, I thought that you had read your story

621
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and I completely blanked, so I'm sorry.

622
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
No, because we're starting with a Rock Band story tonight.

623
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That's okay.

624
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Because I thought that you...

625
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That's all right. I'm done with my gaming week.

626
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Let's do housekeeping and then we can talk about Rock Band, okay?

627
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Can I go call under the couch now?

628
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
No, you're fine, you're fine.

629
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Housekeeping tonight.

630
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I wanted to mention of Penny Arcade coverage,

631
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the seven hours, eight hours worth of stuff

632
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
we did at Penny Arcade Expo is up.

633
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It was really Bobby that did it all,

634
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
because he was there the whole time.

635
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But we...

636
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
At least I pretty much was there all day Friday

637
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and all day Saturday.

638
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Dark Soccer and Loki spent pretty much

639
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
all their time there too.

640
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So check that out.

641
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Pax.allgames.com is there

642
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and that's where you can actually get now

643
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
some video is being posted as well

644
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
of the interviews that Bobby did.

645
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
He actually has some interviews

646
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and I think I showed up in the first one.

647
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I asked a question of the Jumpgate Evolution guy.

648
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So it's there and you can download it

649
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and it's neat.

650
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Bobby did a very good job with the videos.

651
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I was very happy.

652
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
E for All is the next expo on the radar

653
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and sadly all three of us are not going to be

654
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
going to E for All, but I am.

655
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm going to go for E for All

656
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to represent Orange Lawns Radio

657
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and I know a lot of folks might be thinking why.

658
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
E for All does not appear to be having

659
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
the big exhibitor list of other conventions

660
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and to me I actually think

661
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
that's kind of the charm of it.

662
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I want to go and promote Orange Lawns Radio

663
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
to the gamers that will show up

664
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and from what I hear All Games

665
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
is going to have a heck of a booth there.

666
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Their theme has to do with classic games.

667
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm not sure how much I can and can't say

668
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
about the booth, but from what I've heard

669
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
it's going to be a good time.

670
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So if you're in the LA area

671
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
you should come out and check us out at E for All.

672
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I will be there.

673
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Also, best for last,

674
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
OLRPSP.com, especially for you kids

675
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that listen to Orange Lawns Radio on your PSP.

676
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
If you have not checked this out yet,

677
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
you've got to see this.

678
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
On OLRPSP.com, Loki launched,

679
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
just in time for Penny Arcade Expo,

680
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the All Games Radio Player.

681
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You actually download it to your crossbar.

682
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's not spam or anything, don't worry.

683
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
There's no ads or anything like that.

684
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What you do, you can actually listen

685
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
to All Games Radio right from your crossbar.

686
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It takes you right to this fancy player

687
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
that is awesome.

688
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You've just got to see it.

689
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You don't have to try and figure out

690
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
the radio tuner that's built in

691
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
that's really horrible trying to find

692
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
All Games on it or anything.

693
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You can just go 6 o'clock Sunday night,

694
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
or heck, if you want to tune in

695
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
to some of the other programming,

696
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
tune in at 4.45 p.m. Pacific Sunday night.

697
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Go on your PSP to the Orange Lawns Radio

698
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
All Games listener, and you go right

699
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
to All Games Radio and listen to everything.

700
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's great.

701
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Check it out.

702
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I can say how great it is without

703
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
sounding like I have an ego,

704
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
because Loki did it all.

705
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
He really did a great job,

706
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
not just for us representing Orange Lawns Radio,

707
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
but for representing allgames.com.

708
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Plus, he let out a series of colorful expletives

709
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
while he was working on it,

710
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and that was pretty funny.

711
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yes, it was funny to watch.

712
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So, good times.

713
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So check that out, OLRPSP.com.

714
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Also, we're trying something new tonight.

715
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
OChat28 is giving an endorsement.

716
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It says the PSP All Games Radio

717
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
is pretty damn cool.

718
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
chat.orangelawnsradio.com.

719
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Tonight we're trying something new.

720
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Since it is just Dark Soccer and myself

721
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
here in the studio,

722
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
our Skype line is going to be open all night.

723
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
We're going to take calls

724
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
as we get them tonight.

725
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We're trying something new.

726
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
If you feel at any time you want to call in

727
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and give us a call,

728
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
comment on what's going on.

729
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

730
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
800 numbers back tonight.

731
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Or our username on Skype,

732
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Orange Lawns Radio.

733
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So we're not going to have a special segment

734
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
at the end of the show.

735
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Instead, we hope you guys will tune in

736
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
when you have something to say

737
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
about one of the stories going on tonight.

738
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And we'll see how it goes.

739
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But please keep in mind that

740
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
we don't want the same people to call in

741
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
over and over and over again.

742
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So once you've gotten through once,

743
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
please let some other people through.

744
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay.

745
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So, yeah.

746
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
At any time you can give us a call.

747
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Skype line is open right now.

748
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll be reminding you of the number

749
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
throughout the show.

750
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Now we can get into some gaming news.

751
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Okay?

752
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And we'll start with some Rock Band.

753
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I know you're really surprised.

754
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm still going to go hide under the couch.

755
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That's alright.

756
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
As long as you're playing Rock Band.

757
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Rock Band released a Penny Arcade Expo pack this week.

758
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It is $3 or 240 Microsoft points.

759
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And what's pretty cool about it,

760
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
all of the proceeds are going to the Child's Play charity.

761
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Which, you know, Gabe and Tycho at Penny Arcade,

762
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
they love that.

763
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And the other cool thing,

764
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
the performers in the PAX pack

765
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
were actually people that were at Penny Arcade Expo.

766
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So even if you were not there live at the show,

767
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
it's kind of like you could have PAX in your house a little bit.

768
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And you can play along to Skullcrusher Mountain

769
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
by Jonathan Colton,

770
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
which you've got to love that here at Orange Lounge Radio.

771
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
We've talked about that before.

772
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Living on the Corner of Dude and Catastrophe by MC Frontalot

773
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and Shh by Darkest of the Hillside.

774
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I think it's three bucks.

775
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Shh, by the way, is a previously unreleased track.

776
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The other two songs have been released before

777
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and they are all master recordings.

778
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So if you have Rock Band and you want to feel good

779
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
about donating to Child's Play and get some music at the same time,

780
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
there you have it.

781
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Rock Band, PAX pack.

782
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm going to do my story now.

783
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah, so Gee, Dark Soccer, do you have anything you want to share with us?

784
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh, stop making fun of me, okay?

785
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
You can't resist. It's my job.

786
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Infinite Undiscovery has an ad on this.

787
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
No, I'm just kidding.

788
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Oh yeah, that was pretty too.

789
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I forgot to mention Infinite Undiscovery.

790
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I bought it.

791
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And I played it for an hour

792
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and I was extremely disappointed

793
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
compared to what I played at PAX.

794
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I thought at PAX, I had a good time at PAX,

795
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
but I really hated the opening of this game.

796
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I think, God, the whole ogre chase thing

797
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
is not a way to start the game.

798
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That was a horrible idea

799
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and it really just made me disinterested almost in the whole thing.

800
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It doesn't suck how like one poorly planned level

801
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
can just ruin an entire game.

802
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm going to try and stick it out

803
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and try to get to some of the parts I saw at Penny Arcade Expo,

804
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but I was not happy with Infinite Undiscovery.

805
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Anyhow, sorry, go ahead.

806
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Alright, well, the song list that I mentioned before

807
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
in order of difficulty is, for Rock Band 2, sorry,

808
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000

814
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Uh, it's, yeah, Guitar Difficulty, sorry.

815
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Um, Rebel Girl, So What You Want,

816
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000

Um, the next level up is Drain You, New Kid in School,

818
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Hello There, Lump, American Woman, that's fun.

819
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I Was Wrong, Night in the Afternoon,

820
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000

Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I meant, Solid is the third stage.

825
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So, Psycho Killer, Spirit in the Sky, Kids in America,

826
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Feel the Pain, oh, that's a good song too.

Night Lies, and then, uh, what?

842
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I was just gonna say, thank you, Harmonics, for the journey, I love you.

843
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Nightmare Level, now I'm thinking of Doom,

851
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm sorry, this is good, I'm actually glad you're reading the whole list,

852
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
cause I forgot about how some of these songs are in rock band too,

853
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
it's gonna be pretty awesome. Yeah, that's why I just had to do the whole thing.

854
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Spoon Man Makes Me Happy, um,

855
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
you know, before Chris Cornell damaged his voice and doesn't sound as awesome

856
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
as he used to, um, Almost Easy, Chop Suey,

857
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Shackler's Revenge, and then Impossible Mode

858
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
is Master Exploder, Ramblin' Man,

859
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Shoulder to the Plow, Get Clean,

860
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Colony of Birchmen, Peace Cells,

861
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Souls of Black, um,

862
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Battery, Panic Attack, Visions, Painkiller,

863
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
so, there you go.

864
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Now see, the only bummer is that a lot of the songs I really wanna play

865
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
are not in the difficult category, but that's okay,

866
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
you know, I understand, because they want the difficult songs to be the more

867
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
guitar, metal, stuff that I don't really listen to

868
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
usually, but man, as a whole,

869
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
that's probably my favorite, like, band game, and I'm counting

870
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Guitar Heroes as band games, song list yet, I, I'm

871
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
very excited about this game, uh, Rock Band 2, and it's only

872
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
going to be, uh, a few days away. Uh,

873
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Quiltipo in Chat says, Master Exploder will be an interesting song

874
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
to sing. I think if you actually look at the list for vocals,

875
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Master Exploder's like, towards the easiest songs, I wonder

876
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
why. I'm curious what you guys think about the Rock Band 2

877
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
song list and the, uh, difficulties, 1877 Game

878
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLondrio, I'm kinda

879
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
curious if people are actually gonna call, or if everybody's gonna wait till the end, like

880
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
usual. That's why this is an experiment tonight.

881
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
More Rock Band, I mean, we just have a

882
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
crapload of music game news tonight, especially, you know, as we're on the brink

883
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
of a Rock Band 2 being released, lots and lots of music game news

884
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
tonight, and, uh, the details are finally out for how you

885
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
are going to get your Rock Band 1 songs into Rock Band 2.

886
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It is available to happen now, even though Rock Band 2

887
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
is not technically out yet, you can start the exporting process.

888
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The whole process takes about 10 minutes, and it'll set you back

889
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
$5, and it'll allow you to take 55 songs,

890
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
take them out of Rock Band 1, and put them into Rock Band 2.

891
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
There are a few songs that did not make the cut, um,

892
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
due to licensing issues or whatever, but only a few.

893
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Paranoid, uh, by Black Sabbath, although it was a cover

894
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
to begin with, Run to the Hills by Iron Maiden,

895
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
and Enter Sandman by Metallica will not be making its way

896
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
to Rock Band 2. It is probably, uh,

897
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
theorized, uh, Metallica is the next Guitar Hero solo game,

898
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
um, so that's probably why they're going with that camp.

899
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
A lot of people are surprised that the Aerosmith song is actually

900
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
going over into Rock Band 2, but it was brought up by some good

901
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
commenters on some of the blogs I was reading that the, uh,

902
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Train Keep on Runnin', that song that they have in Rock Band 1,

903
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
was not originally written by them, therefore that's probably

904
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
why they don't have so much of a say as to, uh, that game,

905
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
or that song, uh, going into Rock Band 2 or not.

906
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So, uh, very cool. What you can do, it is in the

907
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
options menu of Rock Band 1, you can actually export.

908
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You'll get taken to a menu that will charge you the $5 fee,

909
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and, uh, you can export the 55 tracks, takes about 10 minutes to do,

910
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
uh, and about 1.5 gigs on your hard drive,

911
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
because you are riving those songs off the disc and turning them into,

912
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
basically, download content is essentially what you're doing.

913
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But just think about it, I mean, if you do that,

914
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
when you put in Rock Band 2 on day 1,

915
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
you're gonna have all those songs Dark Soccer just read,

916
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and these 55 new ones, and anything you've downloaded from before.

917
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
So, that's, that's gonna be a heck of a song list,

918
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
even though, you know, a lot of them have already played, but,

919
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
that's neat. I'm looking forward to that.

920
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Uh, it is a bummer that they have to recharge you for that,

921
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
but I guess that's a licensing thing and there's just no way around it.

922
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And, admittedly, $5, not too bad.

923
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Not too bad.

924
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So, I gotta do that quickly before Rock Band 2 comes out,

925
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
because you know there's gonna be tons of people that are ripping the songs,

926
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and then, uh, sell the game back.

927
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I hope the game doesn't pull a gotcha,

928
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and, like, at some point you have to insert the original Rock Band disc,

929
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
or else we'll be screwed.

930
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Well, how about some Guitar Hero World Tour news?

931
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And this makes me happy, because I'm a fangirl.

932
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Um, the, the, uh, latest who's gonna be in the game as a playable character is Sting.

933
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
That makes me very, very happy, because I, like, I was a big police fan.

934
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Um, they're also, um, supposed to, uh, be, uh,

935
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
recreating, uh, Jimi Hendrix, Ozzy Osbourne, Zach Wilde, and Billy Corgan.

936
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So that's pretty cool.

937
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Um, but, it's gonna, you just have to find out, I guess,

938
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
if anyone else is gonna be in Guitar Hero World Tour when it comes out, so.

939
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
That's kinda neat that there's, uh, the different, uh, famous folks in Guitar Hero,

940
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
but, you know, not surprising either, because you had, uh,

941
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
what, the guy from Poison, Bret Michaels, and Slash, and Tom Morello, so.

942
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I guess, uh, Guitar Hero likes to go for the celebrities.

943
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You know what I want?

944
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Guitar Hero Gorilla's Edition.

945
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Good luck.

946
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
That could, that would be fantastic.

947
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm surprised, none of their songs have shown up in any games, though.

948
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Any of these band games, anyway.

949
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Have we had any blur?

950
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't believe so. I could be wrong.

951
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I don't believe so.

952
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
We've had Radiohead.

953
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm sure Chat will correct us if we're wrong.

954
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah, but I would love to see Gorilla's Edition.

955
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Yeah, you know what's pretty rad is that, um,

956
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
in Rock Band 1, when you're playing online,

957
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
uh, you get a random song that you play against your opponent with,

958
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
which I wish Guitar Hero did, so that way everybody didn't pick Through the Fire and the Flames.

959
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But in Rock Band, you get a random song when you're playing Score Attack or whatever.

960
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Um, and if you have download songs in common,

961
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
the random song might just be pulled from your download pool.

962
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So I've actually played, um, Perfect Drug against someone online.

963
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That's a download song.

964
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And today I did My Iron Lung by Radiohead, because that was a download song.

965
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And I thought that was pretty rad that that came up.

966
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And Radiohead's awesome anyway.

967
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And, yeah, and that way you know that the person you're playing with is cool,

968
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
because they spent the money to download that song.

969
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So they must like Radiohead, too.

970
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So, pretty cool.

971
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Uh, Quiltipo would like to point out, Beatlebum is in Rock Band.

972
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Ah.

973
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I thought there was one.

974
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah, but there's better Blur songs than Beatlebum.

975
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Yeah.

976
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Give Me Coffee and TV.

977
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I like that song.

978
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Honestly, if I was gonna-

979
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Girls and Boys, hello.

980
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
No, no, no.

981
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Love that song.

982
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
For just the guitar in it, because I'm sorry, even though he had to be an ass.

983
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Graham Coxon is one of the, I would have to say, best guitar players out there.

984
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And I would love to have had Charmless Man in there,

985
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
because the guitar in that would be really fun.

986
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Bobby's in chat saying, I want to play Rock Band with Rob,

987
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and I also want to play Civ Rev with Rob.

988
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Bring it!

989
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I haven't played Civ Rev in a while.

990
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
There's been all these new games coming out,

991
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
but I still love me some Civilization, don't get me wrong.

992
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Um, well, you know, we've been gushing about Guitar Hero

993
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and Rock Band and all these guitar games all night,

994
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and one person not so much gushing about Guitar Hero right now,

995
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Matthew Sweet, and this actually is a little bit older news.

996
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It came up last week, but Penny Arcade Expo was kind of distracting us.

997
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Matthew Sweet is actually considering that he's gonna be doing a lawsuit against Guitar Hero 2.

998
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
He says, quote, I've been trying to see if I can get a lawsuit against them

999
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
because they never asked to use the song.

1000
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
A lot of kids have gotten into his music because of the inclusion of the song in the game.

1001
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Quote, I found out that the Romantics have a lawsuit going against the makers of that game

1002
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
because of the song, What I Like About You.

1003
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
He says, I don't know if the Romantics are gonna win their suit, but it's really weird.

1004
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I've never sued anyone in my life, and I don't think it would amount to much anyway.

1005
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Hmm.

1006
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So he's thinking about actually, even though he kind of admits more people get into the music,

1007
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
he wants to sue the people that did Guitar Hero for putting his song in there.

1008
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Although it was probably his record label that signed it away.

1009
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Doesn't make sense.

1010
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Probably.

1011
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And honestly though, because I was actually, I don't know if you remember,

1012
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I was really surprised to see Matthew Sweet's songs in there

1013
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
because I've actually been a fan of Matthew Sweet since I was in high school.

1014
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Ever since, no I take that back, ever since college because he did a couple of videos.

1015
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
One of them for a girlfriend that had clips from Cobra in it.

1016
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
He's a big anime fan, that's how I found out.

1017
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And also one with lots of Urasayatsura clips in the video.

1018
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I've been waiting, that was the other one.

1019
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And on top of that, I picked up quite a number of his albums because I have,

1020
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
my favorite album that he did is Altered Beast, and he did one called Son of Altered Beast,

1021
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
that has some of my favorite songs there.

1022
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So to hear that he's wanting to sue a video game company for promoting his music,

1023
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
because I thought that me and five other people liked him,

1024
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
that's just sort of ridiculous I think.

1025
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah, you can be a fan of someone and still admit, smack, what are you thinking?

1026
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
If one of my favorite musicians was doing this, I would say,

1027
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I like you, but what are you thinking, dude?

1028
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And yes, it was Space Adventure Cobra.

1029
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It was a lot of clips from the super uber long movie version.

1030
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Frisbee says sue someone, it's the American way.

1031
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But here's the weird thing, Matthew Sweet references the romantics thing,

1032
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
but that was actually thrown out of court, the whole romantics thing.

1033
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It got laughed out of court essentially.

1034
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
If Matthew Sweet is listening to our show, which I don't think he is,

1035
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:36,000
but if he is, don't sue, because it would be stupid and I'll lose a lot of respect for you.

1036
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Seriously?

1037
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And Keltipo, the Girlfriend album was very good.

1038
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You suing Guitar Hero will go over about as well as when Metallica sued Napster.

1039
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But I mean, you can actually kind of understand why Metallica sued Napster,

1040
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
but in this case, you know, why so upset?

1041
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You know, it gets more people into your music and so on.

1042
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Is he just upset he's not getting more money out of the whole thing?

1043
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Or what is that?

1044
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I mean, if you sell CDs because of it, what's the big fucking deal?

1045
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Well, now we've spun a whole Takahashi anime thing in chat

1046
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
because I happen to mention Ura Sayatsura.

1047
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And also, I think that Fire Tripper is a little better than some of those

1048
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
if you have to go for individual stuff, the end.

1049
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
By the way, that interview is from the North County Times.

1050
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
If you want to check that out for yourself, nctimes.com.

1051
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Did the interview on August 21st, which was when we weren't here.

1052
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Hopefully he snaps out of it and doesn't end up suing the game

1053
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
because I think that would be a little silly

1054
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and is just going to get a more negative publicity

1055
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
amongst the people playing this game than positive.

1056
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I think if he has issues with it, he needs to take it up with his record company

1057
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
or whoever signed on the dotted line and licensed his song away.

1058
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That is the person he needs to be going after

1059
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
if he doesn't want this to happen in the future, in my opinion.

1060
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Well, your opinion counts because you are an internet celebrity.

1061
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Mm-hmm.

1062
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Well, how would...

1063
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Okay.

1064
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
What?

1065
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't know if I'd say that, but okay, I'll take it.

1066
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Oh, come on, the internet is serious business.

1067
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Anyway, for something that, you know,

1068
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
there is quite a bit of classic rock fans still left in the world.

1069
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You know, I'm one, definitely.

1070
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But there are some classic acts that are going to be re-recording

1071
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
some master tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour.

1072
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Some of these are actually in...

1073
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'd have to say MC5's Kick Out the Jams is going to be one.

1074
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
They're actually having some help from Alice in Chains member

1075
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Jerry Cantrell and Guns N' Roses' Gilby Clark.

1076
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Sex Pistols is putting up pretty vacant.

1077
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And Motorhead re-recorded Overkill.

1078
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I like Motorhead, by the way.

1079
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So I think that that's pretty neat.

1080
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
There also, though, was apparently a little bit of trouble, though,

1081
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
with some of the tracks they're wanting to put in,

1082
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
so they're all working on trying to get the bugs ironed out.

1083
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Hmm.

1084
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Could be interesting.

1085
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I think so.

1086
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
We'll see what happens with that.

1087
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Now, you know, we've been talking a lot about music games,

1088
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
but let's not forget the music game that started it all,

1089
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
at least for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1090
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Dance Dance Revolution is still trucking along,

1091
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
and Hottest Party 2 and DDRX have gotten some more song announcements this week

1092
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
about some of the songs that you're going to find in the game.

1093
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2, it's completely made up of covers,

1094
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
but actually now there's also going to be some Konami originals in the game,

1095
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and those were some of the songs they announced this week.

1096
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
For example, we have Desert Journey by DJ Taka.

1097
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
A new song is going to show up in the game.

1098
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Tera Kyouka's Suigetsu Row is coming out.

1099
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And if you want to look at the full list yourself, ddronlinecommunity.com

1100
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
if you want to see some of the other songs that are going to be in the game.

1101
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I do want to also mention the songs that are coming to DDRX on the PlayStation 2.

1102
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Some new licensed songs.

1103
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I thought this was interesting.

1104
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Naropa is coming back, and the reason why that's interesting

1105
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
is because they're one of the different drum artists.

1106
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So now you have the different drum songs going on to PlayStation 2.

1107
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Feel is the song by Naropa that you're going to see in DDRX.

1108
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Some more new edits of old classic DDR songs.

1109
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Remember Butterfly and Dubby Dub were getting recut and re-edited for DDRX.

1110
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I don't know if you heard about that.

1111
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Some other songs got announced.

1112
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Hero is coming. Remember?

1113
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
La da dee da da.

1114
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You are my hero.

1115
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But no, get this.

1116
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Get Up and Move is also getting a new edit.

1117
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Remember SNK? Get up and move.

1118
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That wasn't a good song.

1119
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I didn't like it either, but some people do.

1120
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I was talking to Shane online.

1121
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
He was all excited about that song, but he likes a lot of crap.

1122
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Well, you know, we can't say anything about Mr. High School Musical, so...

1123
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Well, here you go. Here's something cool for you.

1124
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
How about Pet Shop Boys? Always on my mind.

1125
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Sweet!

1126
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
There you go. Something for Jamie.

1127
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So there you go.

1128
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Open from the Dub Pistols synthesized for the punk label Fat Rec Chords.

1129
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
The artist The Epixies was synthesized.

1130
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So it looks like a variety of music.

1131
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
You have synth pop, punk, and bad music.

1132
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
All different genres.

1133
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm just kidding.

1134
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Something for everyone.

1135
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
The bottom of the barrel of the Konami originals.

1136
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah, exactly.

1137
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Trying to see if there's comments from chat.

1138
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com

1139
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Some people are yelling out, get up and move.

1140
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Frisbees remembering there was a sweet freestyle to it.

1141
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I bet there was some pretty awesome freestyle to that song, though, actually.

1142
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I've seen, you know, awesome freestyle done to really crappy songs, so...

1143
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Frisbee also says that they need to do the R21 patch for DDRX Arcade.

1144
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You know, I'm not thinking that's actually going to happen.

1145
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Needs more Too Unlimited.

1146
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
How about no?

1147
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Too Unlimited is like the quintessential Jock Jams band.

1148
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I guess.

1149
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
We're in the Twilight Zone.

1150
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Alright, forget it.

1151
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That song nearly broke my ankle.

1152
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Let's talk about release dates!

1153
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Some games that are coming out this week.

1154
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Loki's not here tonight, but fear not.

1155
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I've got the US release dates.

1156
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Of course, today, Spore was the game that came out this week,

1157
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
along with Spore Creatures on the DS,

1158
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
which played a demo for that at PAX,

1159
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
and you can safely stay away from that one.

1160
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
A lot of folks are very excited about NHL 2009.

1161
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's making its way out this week as well on a variety of systems.

1162
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Also coming out, Lock's Quest on the DS.

1163
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Viva Pinata, Pocket Paradise.

1164
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
That's the whole really weird thing.

1165
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
You're seeing an Xbox franchise on a DS platform.

1166
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Worlds Collide this week on the DS.

1167
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
That comes out September 8th.

1168
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Also coming out on the DS, The Price is Right,

1169
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
the game from none other than Ubisoft.

1170
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
That makes you happy, doesn't it?

1171
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But it's not Bob Barker, is it?

1172
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1173
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Some things just don't need to be made into games,

1174
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and I think that's one of them.

1175
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
They need to do classic Price is Right for you.

1176
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Also that does not need to be made into games,

1177
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Hell's Kitchen is coming out on the Wii,

1178
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
along with the Price is Right port on the Wii.

1179
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And Hell's Kitchen also made its way to the DS.

1180
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Shows just how easy games can go back and forth between the DS and the Wii.

1181
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
If you're more of a PC gamer, guess what?

1182
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You get Romance of the Three Kingdoms Part 11.

1183
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Comes out this week on PC.

1184
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
One would think that romance by now would be stale and dead.

1185
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Dead beyond Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.

1186
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.

1187
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I know it means romance in the classical sense.

1188
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
No, there are just rabid, rabid fans of that series.

1189
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And, you know, I think all the way back to when that series was on the NES.

1190
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Dude, I spent a lot of nights playing Nobunaga's Ambition.

1191
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Remember, those games were awesome.

1192
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
They really were.

1193
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I think it's neat that they've lived on through all this time.

1194
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Maze is a Fate DS, a new role-playing game coming out for the DS this week as well.

1195
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And Dragon Ball Z Trilogy, because you just can never have enough Dragon Ball.

1196
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It's coming out on PlayStation 2.

1197
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Hey, and if you want some packaged games, CSI Super Pac on the PC.

1198
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Little known fact.

1199
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Well, maybe this is a little known fact, but sometimes overlooked fact.

1200
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
The CSI games are designed by the same folks who are very popular for their recent Strong Bad game.

1201
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So, something to think about.

1202
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
If you're going to laugh off a CSI game, it might not be as bad as you think.

1203
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
The more you know.

1204
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Oh, I did play the Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People.

1205
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Now, what did you think?

1206
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It was pretty cool.

1207
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Especially with the seven-track player, it said that it was short-lived because the faulty part of it was the on-switch.

1208
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Uh-huh.

1209
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
There was none.

1210
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I got to read some comments here from chat because they're making fun of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms thing.

1211
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
TheRobD says,

1212
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It needs to be like Madden.

1213
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Romance of the Three Kingdoms 09 with a new roster.

1214
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And GameGuru reminds us there has to be a marriage of the Three Kingdoms first for there to be a divorce.

1215
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Because right now it's just Romance.

1216
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
That would have been part four.

1217
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It's using Romance in an all-encompassing way because right now they're on the ongoing legal battle for custody of the Pet Chihuahua.

1218
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And Quel-Tippo makes the mandatory joke, in-joke here.

1219
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
How long can Lu-Bay and Cow-Cow go at it?

1220
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
That's what Quel-Tippo wants to know.

1221
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Oh, baby.

1222
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I know a game he's been playing.

1223
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
All right, forget it.

1224
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Hump, hump, hump.

1225
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So how about other news?

1226
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
How about it?

1227
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
More stuff!

1228
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And it's all coming out on the 12th.

1229
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
At least in Europe.

1230
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:30,000
We have GTR Evolution on PC, Baha on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and PS2, and R-Type Command on PSP.

1231
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And that's it.

1232
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Slow week?

1233
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Drive-thru, do not pass go, do not collect $200.

1234
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Dang, fries are done.

1235
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You lose, good day, sir.

1236
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Over to Japan and the release dates over there are coming out on September 11th because their release dates are not the same as over here.

1237
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I believe they're on a Friday.

1238
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I have that day off of work, too.

1239
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Congrats, I guess.

1240
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Are they recognizing it?

1241
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Oh, no, it's a Thursday, I'm sorry.

1242
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Are they recognizing it as a holiday now?

1243
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
No, I asked off that day so I could go to San Francisco and go to art galleries.

1244
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh, gotcha.

1245
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
You know, that's actually Loki's birthday.

1246
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I know.

1247
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
That might be part of the reason he's not here.

1248
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,000
He might be at a little thing for his day job, but I think secretly he might be wanting to spend some birthday time with the wife because his birthday is actually September 11th.

1249
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
You never forget when his birthday is.

1250
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Well, my birthday was the Waco thing.

1251
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So what tragedy happens on yours?

1252
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Actually, I did not get tragedy.

1253
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I had some good things happen on my birthday.

1254
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
One, sodomy laws were abolished in Texas on my birthday.

1255
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You know, my birthday was also the day before Hitler's birthday.

1256
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And I'd like to also point out Strom Thurman died on my birthday.

1257
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Just saying, yo.

1258
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You asked what happened on my birthday.

1259
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
There it is.

1260
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Draw whatever conclusions you want.

1261
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
By the way, Strom Thurman also died the same day those sodomy laws were repealed.

1262
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Just food for thought.

1263
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
What?

1264
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
What?

1265
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I like pie.

1266
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Do you?

1267
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Rob.

1268
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
What?

1269
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Rob.

1270
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Rob.

1271
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Rob.

1272
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Rob.

1273
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Rob.

1274
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Rob.

1275
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Rob.

1276
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Rob.

1277
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Rob.

1278
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Rob.

1279
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Rob.

1280
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Rob.

1281
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Rob.

1282
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Rob.

1283
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Guess what?

1284
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
What?

1285
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
All right, look.

1286
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Let's move to Japan in the release dates over there on Thursday, September 11th.

1287
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Viva pinata.

1288
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You know that just here is Viva pinata part two.

1289
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
What's his subtitle for that?

1290
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I forgot.

1291
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's Viva pinata two?

1292
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Something in paradise?

1293
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Yeah.

1294
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Change AWS?

1295
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,200
There's a lot of people who are actually really into that game over here.

1296
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,720
Punching people in the face in paradise?

1297
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,960
I've actually seen a lot of really positive reviews on it.

1298
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,960
Death to pinatas.

1299
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,960
I don't think you can kill the pinatas yet.

1300
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,960
Pinata burning death.

1301
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,960
Although I am waiting for the minigame where you finally take a baseball bat to your damn pinatas.

1302
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,960
Have we had that happen yet?

1303
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:43,960
And find that their guts are made out of, you know, Tootsie Pops and Jolly Ranchers.

1304
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:52,960
The Rob D in chat says, I leave you to envision Skye celebrated the abolishing of sodomy laws with Strom Thurman on his birthday yourself.

1305
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,960
Let's just leave it to the imagination, folks.

1306
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,960
Why do you have to go there?

1307
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,960
Double Clutch comes out on the Xbox 360 in Japan, speaking of double entendres.

1308
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,960
Infinite Undiscovery.

1309
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,960
Game Grumps.

1310
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,960
Wow.

1311
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,960
Viva Pinata 2 electric boogaloo.

1312
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,960
These are all ways that you could celebrate the repeal of sodomy laws.

1313
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,960
Double Clutch and Infinite Undiscovery.

1314
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,960
There you go, coming out on the Xbox 360.

1315
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Also a brand new 360 console in 60 gigabyte flavor.

1316
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,960
Coming out in Japan on the 11th on the Playstation 3.

1317
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:31,960
Double Clutch and Stranglehold makes its way as well to the Playstation 3 on September 11th.

1318
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,960
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

1319
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:40,960
One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1, Nami ni Yoryu Hiyohu is coming out.

1320
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,960
That's a Namco game, actually, coming out.

1321
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,960
I have no idea what it is or if it's something that they're releasing here, but there you go.

1322
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,960
Coming out on the handheld systems, let's take a look.

1323
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,960
Or, sorry, first let's revisit the Playstation 2 because, you know, it's still selling over there.

1324
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,960
Sega Ages 2500, are you listening, Jamie?

1325
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:04,960
Volume 33, Fantasy Zone Complete Collection on the Playstation 2.

1326
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,960
Do you know how much this would cost you to import?

1327
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Less than $30, if you want to pick that up on the Playstation 2.

1328
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
I know.

1329
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Well, you know, I've picked up a lot of the, um, I've actually got the Fantasy Zone remake that they did.

1330
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,960
Because I got, we got like the first three Sega Ages games that came out, the 2900 ones.

1331
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,960
2500, whatever.

1332
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,960
DJ Dark Knight, I don't think the game is Viva Pinata 2 Mercenaries.

1333
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,960
I think that's something else.

1334
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,960
Dark Tetsuya says, I think Sega heard that E all the way in Japan.

1335
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,960
And GS68 says, Jamie just fangasm.

1336
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,960
Can we get a mop in the studio, please?

1337
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Hey! I actually held the microphone away from my face so that I didn't break anybody's eardrums.

1338
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,960
So, you all owe me money now for saving you a medical expense.

1339
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,960
Alright, and you know I love Princess Soft.

1340
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,960
And Princess Soft is releasing a game called Sashu Shiken Kujira Alive.

1341
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,960
Sweet, so sweet, is coming out from Princess Soft on the Playstation 2.

1342
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,960
Now we can visit the handhelds real quick and then we'll get back to some of the gaming news.

1343
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,960
I like the handhelds, don't you?

1344
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,960
Spore, shut up, Spore Creatures is coming out on the DS as well.

1345
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,960
It's just like, gosh, a bunch of other games.

1346
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:20,960
Gaken Mu Henshubu Kansu Choju Jinsu Research File comes out on the Nintendo DS as well.

1347
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,960
As well as some DS Vision games.

1348
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,960
And a game called, what is this, Hoshizora no Comic Garden.

1349
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,960
I wonder if that's an anime.

1350
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,960
Because it has a limited edition, usually limited edition games are games based on animes.

1351
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,960
And on the PSP this week, nothing.

1352
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,960
No games for you this week.

1353
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Your mom, the game.

1354
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,960
Nothing for you on PSP, sorry to say.

1355
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,960
Thank you, pull forward.

1356
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,960
I'm adding that, by the way, to the list of official Orange Noms Radio wanted games.

1357
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,960
Your mom, the game?

1358
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,960
Your mom, the game.

1359
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,960
What would you do in your mom, the game?

1360
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,960
Well, you'd do...

1361
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,960
Zing!

1362
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,960
Nice, nice.

1363
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,960
Alright, that's it for Japanese release dates.

1364
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,960
You caught me in a very weird mood.

1365
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,960
Apparently.

1366
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,960
How about more news?

1367
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,960
How about it?

1368
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,960
Because No Gnus is Good Gnus with Gary Gnu.

1369
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,960
And if none of you get that, then you're too young.

1370
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,960
And I feel old now.

1371
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,960
Eurogamer Expo!

1372
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,960
Eurogamer is actually a very big, very popular site overseas.

1373
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,960
And they carry lots of good news and have Eurogamer TV.

1374
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,960
And I actually go to that site quite often.

1375
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,960
But Eurogamer Network is having Eurogamer Expo.

1376
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,960
And I've said Eurogamer a whole bunch of times in a row.

1377
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:42,960
But it's at the Old Truman Brewery, October 28th through 29th in London.

1378
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,960
And there will be some more details up there.

1379
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,960
But it will be two sessions each day, 11am to 4pm and 5pm to 10pm.

1380
00:59:50,960 --> 01:00:02,960
Also going to be playable there, Street Fighter IV, Prince of Persia, Mirror's Edge, Little Big Planet, Tomb Raider Underworld, Far Cry 2, Fallout 3, Saints Row 2, and many more!

1381
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,960
In other words, all the shit we already played at PAX.

1382
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,960
Hey!

1383
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,960
Just kidding.

1384
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,960
No, I think this is a great idea.

1385
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,960
Actually, we didn't get Rob, but we didn't get Street Fighter IV.

1386
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,960
Alright, alright.

1387
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,960
And I don't believe I saw any Prince of Persia.

1388
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,960
I'm just messing.

1389
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,960
Gotta get your feathers all ruffled.

1390
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,960
We did get Velvet Assassin and that girl needed to eat too.

1391
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:38,960
So, at any rate, I would actually very much love for any of our European listeners, if you're going, write us up, review, take photos, get back, get some internet celebrity for yourself through our site.

1392
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,960
Which hopefully we'll have our new site done by the time Eurogamer Expo happens.

1393
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,960
I personally will be at a steampunk convention.

1394
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:52,960
What made you, uh, what do you think provoked the idea of a Eurogamer Expo?

1395
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,960
Well, don't really all they have is Leipzig over in Europe.

1396
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,960
This just seems kind of, like, sudden, you know what I mean?

1397
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,960
It just came out of nowhere.

1398
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,960
I think it sounds fun, especially if it's at a brewery.

1399
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,960
Don't get me wrong, it sounds fun and all, but it just seems very sudden.

1400
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,960
Beer and video games, how can you go wrong?

1401
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,960
Alright, fair enough.

1402
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,960
They know how to party.

1403
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,960
By the way, we had some great drinks in Seattle.

1404
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,960
We went to, I like Tap House, but it was too hot.

1405
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,960
Yeah, Tap House was cool, and what was the other one, Von's?

1406
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,960
Von's.

1407
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,960
Oh, yeah, I like the supermarket chain here, but it's a bar up in Seattle.

1408
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,960
They had, um, taps, um, from, like, different breweries all over the wall,

1409
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,960
and they had in big bold letters on, uh, their banner outside,

1410
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:37,960
We Do Not Serve Bud, and I was like, this place is already fantastic.

1411
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,960
And then they had, um, really, really good food, and I tried some very interesting beer.

1412
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,960
That was one of my favorite places, but we did not have, I gotta say, Seattle folks,

1413
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,960
we did not have a single bit of bad food up in Seattle.

1414
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,960
I really didn't.

1415
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,960
We did eat.

1416
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,960
Y'all know how to eat.

1417
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,960
We did eat some fairly, a couple places we went to were a bit more upscale

1418
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,960
than I think we were anticipating, but.

1419
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,960
Still, I've eaten some shitty food here locally.

1420
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Look, I've eaten off the menu at Cheesecake Factory, which you know I don't,

1421
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,960
I don't enjoy their lunch at all.

1422
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,960
They have good breakfast, though.

1423
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,960
I don't, I don't, I don't think, you don't go to Cheesecake Factory for the food,

1424
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,960
or for cheesecake, but I had some great food in Seattle, which ironically,

1425
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,960
there was a lot of people going to Cheesecake Factory in Seattle,

1426
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,960
but I was kind of like, what's the point?

1427
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,960
We went to Sago World Grill, and that was cute.

1428
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,960
Sago World Grill was great.

1429
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,960
Best burger I've ever had in a really good pizza.

1430
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,960
So anyway.

1431
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,960
Good times.

1432
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,960
Anyway, sorry.

1433
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:26,960
And foodio!

1434
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,960
Mm, orange lunch foodio.

1435
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,960
Uh, well, you know, we could eat some foodio and play Halo 3.

1436
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,960
Halo 3 Mythic was apparently spotted by some folks at Penny Arcade Expo.

1437
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,960
Halo 3 Mythic showed up just before the Penny Arcade Expo official kickoff.

1438
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,960
I wonder if one of the press folks actually snuck a picture of that,

1439
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,960
what was going on.

1440
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,960
But apparently, Halo 3 Mythic is something that was kind of poking through,

1441
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,960
maybe something that shouldn't be announced yet,

1442
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,960
that's going to be coming out soon.

1443
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,960
Apparently, Halo 3 Mythic only has a multiplayer-only menu,

1444
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,960
and it's version 1.2.

1445
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,960
Kind of interesting.

1446
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,960
What's also interesting about it is that possibly there are some new achievements

1447
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,960
coming from this as well.

1448
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,960
And who knows, it could be Photoshopped or whatever,

1449
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,960
but apparently, if this Halo 3 Mythic thing is true,

1450
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,960
there's 30 new achievements coming with it.

1451
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,960
That's 750 gamer points for achievements such as

1452
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,960
Came From Behind, Flag Dropped, Defend This, Double Double,

1453
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,960
and Vidmaster Challenge Annual,

1454
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,960
which has no gamer score but is an achievement nonetheless.

1455
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,960
If you want to see the full list of those,

1456
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,960
they are available on some various blogs out there.

1457
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:36,960
They went originally on the Ascendant Justic forum.

1458
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,960
So check that out.

1459
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,960
You Halo 3 fans.

1460
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,960
Well, other things to check out that would definitely enable some Halo 3 action.

1461
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,960
The Xbox 360 price cut is official, actually,

1462
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,960
as of the 5th of this month.

1463
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:57,960
They've dropped the price of the 60 gigabyte to $2.99,

1464
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,960
and the Xbox 360 Arcade to $1.99,

1465
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,960
and the 360 Elite to $3.99.

1466
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,960
Basically, I guess it's just going to pave the way for more sales,

1467
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,960
and I hope that they're not...

1468
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,960
I would think that they've gotten past where they were working

1469
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,960
at a loss on their consoles, don't you think?

1470
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,960
They might still be taking a little loss,

1471
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,960
but I think for them to be price point under the Wii,

1472
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,960
it might just be worth it.

1473
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,960
Seriously, and to be perfectly honest,

1474
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,960
and this is, again, my opinion,

1475
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,960
and the system is only as good as the games that are on it,

1476
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,960
as I've said many times,

1477
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,960
but I think that the Xbox 360 right now has the better library,

1478
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,960
and I think them dropping the price of the systems

1479
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,960
while keeping the titles where they are now

1480
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,960
is a very smart move and should definitely turn in a profit for them.

1481
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,960
I think that's a very good idea,

1482
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,960
because honestly, the games are great.

1483
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,960
There's been very few things that I haven't really enjoyed playing on Xbox 360.

1484
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,960
Who doesn't like cheap? Who? No one.

1485
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,960
The people that bought Yaris.

1486
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,960
Zing. Maybe that, but really, that's it.

1487
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,960
Who doesn't like cheap?

1488
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:17,960
I really like Cheap Cheap's cooking show on Parappa.

1489
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,960
So we'll see if the price cuts move more systems,

1490
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,960
because a lot of folks are forecasting that it's going to move big amounts of systems,

1491
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,960
because there's going to be people to go in trying to get Wiis,

1492
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,960
and folks aren't going to be able to get it,

1493
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,960
so they're going to get an Xbox 360.

1494
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,960
We'll see.

1495
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,960
Katamari's Forever in chat says,

1496
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,960
Oh no, now the Wii will have lower sales than the 360.

1497
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,960
Really, though, if you want Wii, you'll get Wii no matter what.

1498
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,960
Scalper, anyone?

1499
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,960
There you go.

1500
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,960
Misty says, I still say Poopy on Arcade.

1501
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,960
Not enough storage space for my planned Rock Band downloads.

1502
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,960
So it's a very good point.

1503
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,960
Even though the system might be cheaper than the Wii,

1504
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,960
it's not the greatest Xbox 360 system,

1505
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,960
and I think there's going to be a lot of people out there that are going to find this out the hard way.

1506
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,960
And then they have to fork over that extra $100 anyway a little later on for the hard drive.

1507
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,960
That's going to be tough.

1508
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,960
We've got one more story for you guys before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.

1509
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
I can't stress this enough.

1510
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,960
This is rumor and rumor only,

1511
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,960
but apparently it's very interesting that this rumor is timed as soon after Penny Arcade Expo as it is,

1512
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:27,960
and that rumor is that right now E3, the board behind E3, is in talks to make E3 public.

1513
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,960
Why not?

1514
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,960
It's worked so well for Penny Arcade Expo.

1515
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,960
They are talking about making it public.

1516
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,960
Apparently the idea has officially been brought forward to the Entertainment Software Association,

1517
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,960
and that could mean as soon as next year the show could be public.

1518
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,960
Now that could also be a bunch of wishful thinking,

1519
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,960
but we have heard a lot of developers and organizers talking pretty openly about the E3 sucks now.

1520
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,960
A lot of them were the same ones who said,

1521
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,960
It sucked before. We want it to be private.

1522
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:04,960
But what's also interesting to note is that with that you have a lot of people praising Penny Arcade Expo,

1523
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,960
and I've got to say this compared to something we didn't talk about earlier in the show,

1524
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,960
and I know PAX is an E3, and we've heard tons and tons of comparisons,

1525
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,960
and that PAX is what everybody thought E3 was going to be when they heard about E3,

1526
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,960
and PAX is just all this stuff.

1527
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,960
But just asking directly, comparing the two shows since we've been fortunate to go to both

1528
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,960
and talking about old E3 and PAX, at least I know what I noticed.

1529
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,960
One thing I noticed, people were way more laid back at PAX.

1530
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,960
It was great. I thought it was fantastic.

1531
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,960
Keep in mind, you've got so many people in such an area.

1532
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,960
Even as big as E3 was, there's going to be tensions running.

1533
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,960
You've got a lot of professionals that have to get from appointment to appointment to appointment.

1534
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,960
We had to do that, especially our last year at E3.

1535
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,960
How many appointments did we set up trying to get interviews and visiting?

1536
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,960
Exactly.

1537
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,960
Because we didn't have to schedule interviews, the developers, those who made it,

1538
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,960
were just there chatting about everything and being so open about the games

1539
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,960
and letting everyone take pictures and not having all this crap,

1540
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,960
especially people with a bug up their butt and not letting you take pictures,

1541
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,960
which they did this year here at PAX. They were great about it.

1542
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,960
But it was just so completely laid back. Everyone was friendly.

1543
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,960
Even the enforcers. I'd say they were all fantastic.

1544
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,960
They did a great job, and they were friendly.

1545
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,960
They were very personable, the ones I dealt with.

1546
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,960
Pardon my French, but everybody had to stick up their fucking ass at E3.

1547
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,960
That's always been my problem with E3 is that people are very snobby.

1548
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,960
I don't know if that's the LA thing or what it is,

1549
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,960
but I don't like getting treated like shit at a video game expo.

1550
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,960
You've heard the stories I've told on this show about some of these big media gatherings

1551
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,960
that we've been to in the past and how we're looked down on.

1552
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,960
They're like, oh, my independent podcast. They don't have millions of listeners.

1553
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,960
I just threw something. I'm so angry.

1554
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,960
A lot of people have sticks at their ass. Not to say everybody is like that at E3.

1555
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,960
There's some very cool people at E3, but at PAX, everybody was awesome.

1556
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,960
Developers are out there on the floor mingling with people.

1557
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,960
Loki played some game, and I watched the people come up to him and say,

1558
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,960
oh, so did you like it? Loki was like, yeah.

1559
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,960
He was trying to be nice and give a positive answer.

1560
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,960
They actually said, what did you like about it? What was cool about it to you?

1561
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,960
I like that they were asking for feedback.

1562
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,960
That guy from Guitar Hero, and I apologize, I forgot his name.

1563
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,960
He didn't have a business card to give me.

1564
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,960
He talked to us for quite some time after the interview he did on All Games Radio.

1565
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,960
He was very cool.

1566
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,960
He did confirm for me that there is no bonus peripheral for studio mode.

1567
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,960
There you go.

1568
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:44,960
You heard it first.

1569
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:45,960
There you go.

1570
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,960
It was very cool. People were just hanging out.

1571
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,960
The guy from Warhammer Online was hilarious when we had him on the show.

1572
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,960
Then I saw him later on the show floor.

1573
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,960
He was just hanging out, chilling, showing off the game.

1574
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,960
People are so much more laid back at PAX.

1575
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,960
I ran into my DM again, and he waved at me.

1576
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:07,960
If they put it on the floor at PAX, they realize the pictures are going to be all over the internet.

1577
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,960
People have finally gotten over it, and they don't try to control it so much at PAX

1578
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,960
because they realize it's a gamer thing.

1579
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,960
So if E3 is going to take that step, that's a big step for E3.

1580
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,960
A lot of people are going to have to change their attitudes. Cap'n!

1581
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,960
Just saying.

1582
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:30,960
You know, I still didn't have quite the problem that you guys had at E3.

1583
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:37,960
But I think that a lot of it has to do with...

1584
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,960
I'm just saying, Luke, who didn't go to PAX?

1585
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,960
Yeah.

1586
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,960
Some people can't handle it, I guess.

1587
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,960
Because PAX is too coo.

1588
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:51,960
Anyhow, we actually asked this question on our pre-OLR Twit on our Twitter.

1589
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,960
Twitter.com slash OLR at us on Twitter.

1590
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,960
There's been quite a few people to have this week, so thank you guys very much for that.

1591
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,960
And we hope you enjoyed the updates from Jamie's iPhone at Penny Arcade Expo.

1592
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,960
I was in charge of the...

1593
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,960
And sometimes the pictures didn't attach with the text I included.

1594
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,960
So, oops.

1595
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:08,960
Oh, how funny.

1596
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,960
But awesome technology, because we had the All Games listeners, and as it was going on,

1597
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,960
I think you actually took, because we weren't able to do live video, just due to bandwidth,

1598
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,960
but you would actually take, I think when the guy was there with this Game Boy playing the song,

1599
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,960
you took a picture of it, put it on Twitter, and within a minute,

1600
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,960
it made its way into the All Games chat room so people could see it.

1601
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,960
So it wasn't video, but it was definitely instant media, which was great.

1602
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,960
I was just thinking that if people were actually keeping up with the Twitter,

1603
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:37,960
I wanted them to see who we were talking to while we were live, so that's what my thought was.

1604
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,960
Some comments from the Twitter to people that responded to our question.

1605
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,960
We asked, hey, there is a rumor that E3 is going public.

1606
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,960
Is this a good idea or a bad idea?

1607
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,960
DJ Rama S says, good idea.

1608
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,960
I mean, a lot of other Expos are public, so why not?

1609
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,960
As long as you pay for a pass and follow the rules, fair game.

1610
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,960
Quiltipo says, capital idea.

1611
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,960
I've always wanted to meet D-list celebrities.

1612
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,960
Because remember, E3 went under because of Paris Hilton and stuff.

1613
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,960
But even PAX had their D-list celebrities.

1614
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,960
I mean, you know, if you consider Jonathan Colton, Wil Wheaton, Freezepop, you know.

1615
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,960
But we had cool people there.

1616
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:08,960
That's true.

1617
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,960
People that actually cater to the nerd crowds.

1618
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,960
We had people there who worked for their fame.

1619
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,960
To be fair, E3 did have Adam West.

1620
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,960
To be fair.

1621
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,960
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

1622
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:21,960
Anyway.

1623
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:25,960
Also, I want to point out, Misty OLR responded and said, public?

1624
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,960
You mean it wasn't public enough with all the loopholes that got exploited?

1625
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,960
She says, bad idea, I think.

1626
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,960
Especially with your report of the last E3 you went to.

1627
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,960
Act Def says, considering the success of Penny Arcade Expo, I think they want to emulate that to redeem themselves.

1628
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,960
I do hope they get it right, though.

1629
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,960
I apologize if I managed to announce this name.

1630
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,960
Giovedea? G-I-O-V-E-D-A? Giove?

1631
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,960
Oh, my bad.

1632
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,960
It says, bad idea for the whole time, but good idea to open it public for a day.

1633
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,960
It's an industry expo, not a convention.

1634
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,960
And you know, that's something I've heard a lot, is make it more like Tokyo Game Show, where it's closed for one day, but open for the rest.

1635
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,960
And I think that would be fair. I think a good conclusion.

1636
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,960
And DROfWarC, I think that might be Doctor of Warcraft or something like that?

1637
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,960
I don't know. DROfWarC says, screw E3 going public.

1638
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,960
PAX is the new thing in town.

1639
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,960
But really, it wouldn't hurt to have the two West Coast shows.

1640
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,960
Forget E for No One.

1641
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,960
Hey, wait a minute. I'm going to E for No One. Come on.

1642
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,960
It might actually be kind of cool. You never know what might happen.

1643
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:32,960
So, again, if you want to get the pre-OLR Twits and respond to a story before the show goes live, check us out on Twitter.

1644
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,960
Our username? O-L-R.

1645
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,960
Really hard to remember, I know.

1646
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:37,960
Really difficult.

1647
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,960
Alright, we are about to go to, Rama says, you butcher Japanese and Italian.

1648
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:47,960
Yes, I do. Look, foreign language was my one weakness in high school, if it's not completely obvious here on this show.

1649
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:48,960
Okay?

1650
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,960
So, there you go.

1651
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:58,960
Como te llama. Alright, let's go to a much better segment than me horribly mispronouncing names here on the show.

1652
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,960
And talk about the classic video game of the week.

1653
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:08,960
Every week, Dark Sakura goes into the archives and pulls out a classic video game she thinks you all should be playing.

1654
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,960
And I got to tell you, this week, she went far into the archives this week.

1655
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,960
So, Dark Sakura, what should all the kids be playing this week?

1656
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:23,960
The game of the week is actually quite the obscure little title called Puzzle and Dessu.

1657
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:36,960
Which, also, if you happen to find the name actually written in Japanese text, the first part of it's in katakana and the last part's in hiragana and the second part's in katakana, which is very weird.

1658
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:43,960
But anyway, it's a little puzzle game where you're this guy with a pointy hat who looks like a naked gnome.

1659
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,960
And the game plays...

1660
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,960
That's the Travelocity Gnome with no pants.

1661
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:55,960
The game itself plays sort of like a combination of Pengo, Columns, and Bomberman.

1662
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:07,960
And the publisher on this game, for those who actually keep up with putting that on the wiki, is Nichibutsu Nihon Busan.

1663
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:16,960
It was actually released on April 14th, 1995, and I almost bought a copy at PAX, but I didn't.

1664
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:24,960
But anyway, the way that it works is that you've got these four different colored blocks, and you have to make all of them touch.

1665
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:35,960
However, if three of them touch, then they vanish, and you may actually lose the entire puzzle and the time limit that you're given, because you haven't made all the blocks vanish.

1666
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:46,960
And actually, because it is that weird and obscure, I'm going to be linking one of the images into the chatroom so that they can see what it's like.

1667
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,960
And honestly, if you can...

1668
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,960
People are playing emulators, just freaking download it already.

1669
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,960
It's a really fun little game.

1670
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:03,960
But keep in mind, as you get further and further into the game, it actually comes up a bit more like Super Silkeban, if anyone's played that.

1671
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:08,960
And you have such a massive challenge on trying to get your blocks touching.

1672
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,960
Basically, you have to shove them in position.

1673
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,960
But, as you go further, you'll get some with percentage marks on them that are immobile.

1674
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,960
You get ice blocks that will dissipate when they touch another object.

1675
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:29,960
You have arrow blocks, which you can only push in the direction that they're pointing.

1676
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:40,960
You've also got a block, because you can actually play multiplayer, you can block other people from making different moves.

1677
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,960
And then you've got teleport blocks that you can move them around.

1678
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,960
So it's just a very, very interesting little game.

1679
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,960
It gets very, very challenging.

1680
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:57,960
And it's definitely one if you like a game that makes you think a little bit.

1681
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:03,960
But it is only, you cannot play against the computer, it's only against people.

1682
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,960
Or you can do single-player mode, which is just you.

1683
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,960
It's really just a fun little game, really it is.

1684
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,960
That's all I can say about it.

1685
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:22,960
Really obscure to the US market, but I think there's been another game similar to this release in the US, but for the life of me, I can't rumble with this.

1686
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,960
So...

1687
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,960
I know, I want to say I've played a game like this too, and I don't know what the hell it is.

1688
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,960
But it drove me nuts, it's hard. This is a hard game.

1689
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,960
But I will put the name of it in the chatroom, so they can look it up.

1690
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,960
Or you can actually look at the same YouTube I'm looking at here, Puzzle Endesu.

1691
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,960
D-E-S-U. Very easy to spell.

1692
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,960
Yeah, I just blogged the name in.

1693
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,960
And we'll link the, if you want to, since you've got it up, if you'll link that in the chatroom.

1694
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,960
Sure.

1695
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,960
But it's really fun.

1696
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:55,960
And remember, if you want to see these links as they show up, you've got to listen live to us on Sunday nights.

1697
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,960
Chat.OrangeLauncherDude.com to join our chatroom.

1698
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,960
And AllGames.com is where we're broadcasting every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific time.

1699
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,960
There it is, your classic game of the week, Puzzle Endesu.

1700
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,960
Very simple game that will drive you nuts.

1701
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,960
No calls during part A. I guess people don't like the whole, or they're just not used to it, the whole calls during the show thing.

1702
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,960
So we'll just have to open it up at the end of B like usual.

1703
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,960
So much for that experiment.

1704
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,960
Well, you try new things.

1705
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:22,960
Call us!

1706
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:23,960
Nah, I already shut it off for now.

1707
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,960
No, Colton, come back on part B.

1708
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:30,960
No, we're already in hour 20 for part A, so we've got to take a break, so we can get to part B.

1709
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,960
All right, we'll get on part B.

1710
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,960
Don't worry, we'll have time for calls in part B.

1711
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,960
It's just folks are used to the end of the show.

1712
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:37,960
So we'll do that.

1713
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:38,960
We're going to take a quick break.

1714
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,960
We'll be back, though, with more of OrangeLauncher Radio right after a quick break.

1715
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:51,960
We'll see you then.

1716
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:57,960
Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here from OrangeLauncher Radio with an important message.

1717
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:03,960
Every year, thousands of yellow wizards are about to die from a horrible outbreak, food shooting.

1718
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:08,960
Shooting food causes the loss of life in many red warriors and green elves across the planet.

1719
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,960
Elf needs food badly, so please think twice before shooting food this holiday season.

1720
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:22,960
The Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault.

1721
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:31,960
Remember, don't shoot food.

1722
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:32,960
She's calm.

1723
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,960
There are a couple of other things I just tell you and I remember.

1724
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:36,960
He's crazy.

1725
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:42,960
If you could not see the similarities and the personalities within, like, the first couple of episodes, you need brain surgery.

1726
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:43,960
I mean, seriously.

1727
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,960
Can two people get together and record a podcast without driving each other crazy?

1728
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,960
Slap.

1729
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,960
Oh, you don't have to hurt me so hard.

1730
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,960
It wasn't that hard.

1731
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:56,960
Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your hosts, DJ Ron Ma S and Kuro Usagi.

Log on to djronmas.net slash anime jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.

1733
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:09,960
Hi, I'm G-Steel, and I just want to say that you are all losers for listening to video games called music.

1734
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,960
Music from video games is just a bunch of beeps and blips.

1735
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:19,960
I don't understand how people say music from, say, Final Fantasies, Frees of Rage, or maximum genius music.

1736
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,960
It's from video games and therefore talent-less garbage.

1737
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,960
Music that Shiro and Ugo Uematsu can partake of by genitalia.

1738
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,960
Video games locked in good health from making people out of electronic beef.

1739
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,960
Don't listen to real music because music that has no tolerance needs to be banned.

1740
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:35,960
Can't think's fine.

1741
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,960
P.S. This PSA is brought to you by La Molana, home of the never-ending hell-tempo music.

1742
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,960
Gaming Radio.

1743
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,960
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1744
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,960
Uh, mooch, uh, moo-kaw-key.

1745
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,960
Orange Lounge Radio.

1746
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,960
Tax cuts.

1747
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,960
Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 7th, 2008.

1748
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,960
For our 293rd episode, if you can believe it.

1749
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:08,960
There was a little boo-boo in the numbering of the podcast last week, and some folks think they got episode 291 twice.

1750
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,960
But no, it was just misnumbering, an error on my part.

1751
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,960
Shoot me.

1752
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,960
Remember, don't shoot Rob. Rob is not food.

1753
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,960
Uh, not with us tonight, of course.

1754
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,960
Techmaster Loki is out for the night, but that's okay.

1755
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,960
It's Dark Soccer and myself, feeling the love.

1756
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,960
But just platonically, thank you.

1757
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:26,960
She's married, I'm gay.

1758
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,960
Alright, you guys are filling in as the co-hosts tonight.

1759
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,960
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have some things you want to say.

1760
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,960
Um, some folks commenting on the various commercials there that were being played during the break.

1761
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:39,960
Having to recycle a little bit.

1762
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:45,960
If you have some promos that you want to have played during our free break, send them on in to us.

1763
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,960
Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you can send me an email.

1764
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,960
So, alright.

1765
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:56,960
Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some gaming news this week with some news on the PSP.

1766
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,960
Sony PSP and PlayStation 3 spend a little time in Sony Land right now.

1767
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:09,960
And this is kind of interesting is that they are now going to be launching a Wi-Fi store on the actual PSP.

1768
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:14,960
The PlayStation Store is actually coming to the PSP and you can do that.

1769
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,960
That will be happening this fall in Japan, but probably it's going to inevitably happen over here as well.

1770
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,960
I mean, if there's money to be made, why not?

1771
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,960
Sony, by the way, is also going to be launching a new infrastructure mode.

1772
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:30,960
This is something that happens when you connect the PlayStation, or the PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3.

1773
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,960
And you can do this all wirelessly.

1774
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:39,960
And then what happens is that you can actually do some type of like multiplayer modes through a PlayStation 3 connection for some games.

1775
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:45,960
So you kind of use your PlayStation 3 as like a hub to kind of do wireless stuff between the PSP.

1776
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,960
Which is kind of interesting.

1777
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:54,960
Could be interesting to see what they do with that, but certainly there's been a lot of love between the PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation 3.

1778
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,960
So it's very neat to see those two work together.

1779
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:04,960
In a way, it seems like Nintendo is just catching up in that regard with the whole DS demos finally making their way to the Wii just a couple months ago.

1780
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,960
We've been waiting.

1781
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,960
Huh, nice.

1782
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:16,960
Well, I'll tell you other things though that we've been waiting for, at least people who are fangirls like me or fanboys not like me because I'm a girl.

1783
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:26,960
Of course, we all knew that Kingdom Hearts was going to be a PlayStation 3 exclusive and there's going to be something about that at Tokyo Game Show.

1784
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:32,960
Well, really though, it's a rumor.

1785
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,960
But, you know, we won't know unless we hear something official from Tokyo Game Show.

1786
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:43,960
But honestly though, given that Kingdom Hearts has already been pretty much strictly...

1787
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,960
Well, except for the DS version, which doesn't count.

1788
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:57,960
But seeing that Squeenix has been sticking with Sony for this franchise for the most part, I wouldn't be surprised if it's going to be a PS3 exclusive.

1789
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,960
So, we'll see.

1790
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:07,960
All right. By the way, I just want to point out Loki, he's not here tonight in studio, but he joined our chat room just a minute ago. I guess he's back from San Francisco.

1791
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,960
He just said, I was tired from the San Francisco trip, so he's entertaining our folks in chat room.

1792
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:19,960
And he's rubbing it in their faces that apparently everybody just at his work got a vacation to their choice of ten destinations.

1793
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,960
It was a little prize they all won tonight and he's rubbing that in everyone's face.

1794
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,960
So if you want to slap Loki, you can do that in our chat room tonight.

1795
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,960
chat.orangesolentrated.com if you are listening live.

1796
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,960
Remember, it's the slash slap command, or you can right click.

1797
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:38,960
And I was actually, I was asking Loki, where are you taking me? But he's mumbling this stuff about having to take the wife.

1798
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:43,960
What's up with that?

1799
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:48,960
I go places without Dan. He's not too happy about it, but I do.

1800
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,960
All right. All right. Back to video games and the real world and so on.

1801
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,960
No, that's cool. Hope he has fun wherever he goes.

1802
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,960
But he better not miss another Sunday or he's so fired. No, I'm kidding.

1803
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,960
All right. Yeah. I'm special and get to miss Sundays, huh?

1804
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,960
No, no, no. He did an awesome job with the PSP or our PSP site.

1805
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,960
So there you have it. And I'm actually I'm going to be gone in a couple of weeks for you for all.

1806
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,960
So lots of radio hosts taking the week off. All right.

1807
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:18,960
Anyhow, PlayStation Network games also going to be simul launched in the UMD form.

1808
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:24,960
I think this is kind of interesting. Apparently, this is actually going to be happening in Europe with a couple of games that are coming out.

1809
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:30,960
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is actually going to be releasing collections of PlayStation Network titles that are going to be on UMD.

1810
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,960
There's the power pack, which is going to have the games flow siphon filter, combat ops and beats.

1811
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:39,960
And the puzzle pack will include Lemmings, go puzzle and go Sudoku.

1812
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,960
So for those of you that didn't feel like getting the games on the PlayStation three or you've still been too cheap to get a PlayStation three.

1813
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,960
Now you can get these on UMD for the PlayStation portable, which I think is kind of interesting there.

1814
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:55,960
It's kind of interesting that there is still that cohesiveness between PlayStation three and PSP.

1815
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:01,960
I think that's kind of interesting that the titles are so I know we joke a lot about the DS and the Wii getting a lot of the same ports.

1816
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:07,960
But I mean, for real, you're seeing like the exact same games, exact same thing going between the PSP and the PlayStation three.

1817
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,960
It's kind of interesting. So you'll be able to check that out in Europe.

1818
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,960
Honestly, I imagine if it sells well over there, it's probably only a matter of time before that stuff comes out over here.

1819
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:21,960
I mean, where there's money to be made. Right. We'll see.

1820
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,960
Oh, that's pretty much the way that it works, isn't it?

1821
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,960
Well, at any rate, we do have some other news.

1822
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:37,960
We also have some information about a little big planet supposed to be having a limited public beta this month.

1823
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,960
And I think that's pretty cool.

1824
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,960
There's no other details about it, but they said there you'll be able to sign up for it.

1825
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:50,960
It just doesn't say how or when or well, but it will be made public right before the test is to be launched.

1826
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,960
They also do have an invite only method.

1827
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,960
So they said they'll be large enough that people around the world will be able to have fun with it.

1828
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,960
So like a Gmail thing, remember when Gmail invites were very rare or wait, no, no, no.

1829
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,960
Live journal. Remember when like you got one invite code for live journal?

1830
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,960
Yeah. Remember that? Unless you paid. Yeah.

1831
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,960
And then you could pay and get a bunch more, but you could invite one person to live journal.

1832
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,960
It sounds like it might be like that where you get to invite one person.

1833
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,960
Could be interesting. Who knows? It could be.

1834
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:22,960
Somebody send me an invite, please.

1835
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,960
If I get a PlayStation 3, then I'll want one of those invites, too. We'll see.

1836
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,960
We could all pass along the invites to each other if that's how it works.

1837
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,960
Although I somehow bet there'll be some controls on that somehow.

1838
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,960
I don't think they'll give it to just anyone. Maybe.

1839
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,960
We'll see.

1840
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,960
One game that's been brought up earlier, and it's a popular PSP game, and somebody was talking about this in chat earlier.

1841
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,960
DJ Max. Have you ever played this game? It's pretty much BeatMania 2DX, but with your PSP.

1842
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,960
And it's Korean, which is interesting.

1843
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,960
Miklotov, you know, old buddy of the show, he loves this game, and he's brought it over a couple times.

1844
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,960
There's some very funny videos on there, and the game's kind of interesting.

1845
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,960
And so obviously a lot of our music game fans love this series, DJ Max.

1846
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,960
Well, guess what? More DJ Max games coming out.

1847
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,960
Pentavision has announced they are coming out with two new titles.

1848
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,960
Pardon me for horribly mispronouncing these names, but there's Clasequel Edition and Black Square.

1849
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,960
I know I got that one right.

1850
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,960
Pentavision is actually going after both the hardcore and the casual gamers.

1851
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,960
It's not really said if these two splits are for that purpose.

1852
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,960
Maybe one is easier than the other. Who knows?

1853
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,960
Who knows if one's got more casual mode and another one is for the more hardcore player.

1854
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,960
But you know if you're a DJ Max fan, you're getting them both anyway.

1855
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,960
So what's the matter?

1856
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,960
There's going to be folks that import both no matter what happens.

1857
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,960
Well, there you go.

1858
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:46,960
Some folks have noticed that there is a lot more mainstream music in the Clasequel Edition.

1859
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,960
So maybe there's more like, you know, the MTV of Korea.

1860
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,960
Those type of artists are in this, you know, CE.

1861
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:57,960
And then Black Square maybe has more of the originals. Who knows?

1862
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:58,960
Maybe.

1863
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:03,960
Some folks in comment or some folks in chatroom are definitely feeling pretty hardcore about this.

1864
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,960
Gsquared68 is a fan of the game and says, wait, what?

1865
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,960
Oh, they're probably just limited editions.

1866
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,960
They need a feature that tracks percentage and not just score.

1867
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:15,960
Scoring system equals combo based equals epic fail.

1868
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,960
But Act Def says, yay, DJ Max.

1869
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,960
So there you go.

1870
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:26,960
Well, on other PlayStation news, and this should make some of our European listeners happy,

1871
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:31,960
is that there will be randomly selected PS3 owners in Europe

1872
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:35,960
who will be able to get the demo of Motorstorm Pacific Rift,

1873
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:41,960
which was only exclusive to the US for people who bought copies of Core on PSN.

1874
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:51,960
For any of the players in Europe who also, I do believe, purchased the game,

1875
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:57,960
it will be available, and it's supposed to include the Air Zone track.

1876
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,960
So you can give it a try, and it has support for single player and two player split screen.

1877
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,960
So it'd be cool.

1878
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:08,960
And actually, it's supposed to be free for a few days before the official release.

1879
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,960
Motorstorm 2 is very pretty, what I saw.

1880
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,960
It was a very popular demo, so I didn't get to get my hands on it,

1881
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,960
but it looked very pretty from what I noticed.

1882
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:19,960
Sorry, I like the jungle scape much more than the dirt of the first one.

1883
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:20,960
Yeah.

1884
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,960
I think the jungle was a much better setting for the game,

1885
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,960
although I would like to see, I don't know, if it's too much to ask for a game with a little more diversity.

1886
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,960
Give us some jungle and some dirt.

1887
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:28,960
Those are the great racing games.

1888
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,960
Even Excite Truck did that.

1889
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:31,960
Dirt.

1890
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:32,960
Exactly.

1891
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:44,960
Well, guess what game you get to experience all over again.

1892
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:45,960
That's right.

1893
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,960
All over again.

1894
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:53,960
And if the PC wasn't enough, and the PSP wasn't enough, and the Xbox 360 wasn't enough,

1895
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,960
you get to get shining and luminous.

1896
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,960
And your mobile phones weren't enough.

1897
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:02,960
You get to do this all over again on the PlayStation Network.

1898
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:03,960
That's right.

1899
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,960
Luminous Supernova was announced on the PlayStation Network this week,

1900
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,960
and it is the same game you know and love.

1901
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:14,960
But with some new stuff, you know there's going to be some new skins, some new songs, and some new modes.

1902
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,960
They've announced Dig Down Mode.

1903
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,960
You use the falling blocks to erase squares from the play field that already has blocks on it.

1904
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,960
So it's basically clearing a crap play field, kind of like Tetris had a mode like that, where the well was already full.

1905
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:27,960
Mr. Driller!

1906
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,960
No.

1907
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,960
Well, a little different, because that's the whole game of Mr. Driller.

1908
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,960
Sequencer mode, though, sounds kind of neat.

1909
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,960
You can actually make your own background music using the sound loops that are in the sound bank.

1910
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:42,960
Drums, bass, synthesizer one, synthesizer two, and effects, 20 different loops.

1911
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:44,960
So you get to kind of make your own songs using the sequencer.

1912
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,960
But then again, I think this sounds exactly like, I don't know if you've ever played the Spice World video game,

1913
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,960
where you can make your own Spice Girls song.

1914
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,960
Pretty much the same thing.

1915
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,960
I mean, really, when you break it down, it was just...

1916
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,960
Spice World was a crabby game!

1917
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,960
No, it was awesomely bad.

1918
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,960
It was like the showgirls of video games.

1919
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,960
It was so bad, it was actually kind of good.

1920
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,960
So there you have it.

1921
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,960
Supernova, 40 unlockable skins in challenge mode.

1922
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,960
Also, of course, skin edit, time attack, puzzle mission modes.

1923
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,960
Two-player versus mode.

1924
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:19,960
No release date set yet, and it's not known if it's going to take the microtransaction approach

1925
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,960
that made this game so controversial on the Xbox 360,

1926
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,960
where you only buy the base game and then have to buy everything separate.

1927
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,960
My gut tells me no.

1928
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,960
That they're not gonna, because it didn't go over well on the 360,

1929
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,960
they'll just charge one big price for the whole thing on the PlayStation Network.

1930
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,960
But we'll see. Time will tell.

1931
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,960
I do like the skin that they released on one of the screenshots here.

1932
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:43,960
It looks like a little 8-bit, I don't know, I'd call it like an Earthbound kind of graphic.

1933
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,960
The guy looks like a character from Earthbound, kind of like running through a background

1934
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,960
of an arcade-looking thing, so that already looks cool.

1935
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:53,960
It's not NES. It's Earthbound-like.

1936
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:56,960
I don't know, I only say that because it's a little kid wearing a baseball cap, so it reminds me of that.

1937
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,960
But there you have it.

1938
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,960
So, yeah, it's going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.

1939
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,960
I'm kind of not interested because whatever they put in this game will be recycled into Luminous 3,

1940
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,960
which I'm sure is inevitable.

1941
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,960
Or they'll release us yet another microtransition for Xbox Live Arcade, I bet.

1942
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,960
And honestly, the Well mode doesn't sound that interesting.

1943
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,960
Sequencer mode sounds okay.

1944
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,960
I'd like it better if you could use your own songs.

1945
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,960
Maybe. Someday. Maybe. Who knows.

1946
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,960
All right, well every week here on Orange Lounge Radio

1947
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,960
we allow you guys to interact with us, not just through the chat room and the phone calls,

1948
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,960
but your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1949
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:34,960
And every week DarkSakura digs into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite emails

1950
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,960
and reads them for you live here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1951
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,960
I'm sure the email's been collecting as we were away at PAX.

1952
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:41,960
Kind of.

1953
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,960
So let's get to it. I don't know if she has time to read them all,

1954
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,960
but she'll at least do some of her favorites tonight.

1955
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,960
Well, I can read most of them.

1956
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:53,960
Um, hey O.L.R., ever since 2006 I was very excited for the Wii since it came out.

1957
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:57,960
I purchased one early 2007. I had to work to pay it off all summer.

1958
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:02,960
I bought all the big Nintendo titles and played each of them for about 20 hours until I got stuck.

1959
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,960
Then I got an Xbox 360. They're incomparable.

1960
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:09,960
The Xbox 360 has good online experience and great high-definition graphics.

1961
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,960
After watching Nintendo's press conference, I have completely lost hope.

1962
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,960
Obviously Nintendo doesn't need to do anything for us.

1963
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,960
Long story short, my Wii is ending today on eBay,

1964
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:24,960
and I'm hoping to get a lot from it seeing as how it still is in demand.

1965
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:30,960
Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.

1966
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:31,960
Love your show. Keep it up.

1967
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,960
By the way, my name is Dan, and my gamer tag is DanTheThird.

1968
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,960
Okay, you have a good name.

1969
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,960
That's up to you. I'm not getting rid of my Wii.

1970
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,960
I still have stuff on that that I like to play.

1971
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,960
Stuff on 360 I like to play.

1972
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:50,960
It just really depends on what type of things that you like.

1973
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,960
I mean, there's stuff on PS3 that I like to play.

1974
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:58,960
You know, it's been a little while since we've reiterated the golden rule of gaming for our listeners,

1975
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,960
so why don't we remind the listeners of what the golden rule of gaming is?

1976
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:05,960
The Wii system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1977
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:09,960
So in other words, if there's a game that looks to be coming out in the Wii's future that you want to play,

1978
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,960
keep in mind that the Wii is the only place you're going to be able to play it, probably.

1979
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,960
Granted, there are some games that get ported everywhere, like Rock Band,

1980
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,960
but a lot of times on the Wii, that's the only place you can play it.

1981
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,960
So if it's going to have the game you want, you've got to hang on to that Wii.

1982
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,960
As much as I've been kind of knocking the game a little bit,

1983
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,960
thinking it could be stale like the other ones,

1984
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,960
I have high hopes for Animal Crossing,

1985
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:33,960
because I want to try it out, because it might actually be pretty cool with the internet-in-the-room-speak thing.

1986
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,960
We'll see. Time will tell.

1987
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,960
But I wouldn't know if I sold my Wii back in a panic,

1988
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,960
and they might be even harder to get when you want them again,

1989
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:45,960
or you might think you make a profit off it now, but it's a risky game.

1990
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,960
It's a risky game to play.

1991
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,960
But at the same time, if you're not enjoying your Wii and you're never playing your Wii

1992
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,960
and you don't think there's anything in the future, then sell it.

1993
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,960
Some other family probably really wants it. Why not make some money off it?

1994
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,960
But realize, I've seen people do this.

1995
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:03,960
I've even seen a good friend of mine do this, where he'll get a system, sell it back,

1996
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,960
buy the same system six months later, sell it back, buy it again.

1997
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,960
And I'm just kind of like, what are you thinking? You're losing so much money doing that.

1998
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:14,960
If you think something's going to come out on it that you want to play in the future, hang on to it.

1999
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,960
You'll save money in the long run.

2000
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:20,960
Next you up, and this is regarding Evangelion, actually.

2001
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:23,960
Hi, I have a friend that is obsessed with Evangelion,

2002
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,960
and I was wondering if there were any good games from that series.

2003
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:29,960
The answer is no, unless you like playing the dating sim kind,

2004
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:33,960
and then I've got, there was, you know, the Saturn ones that came out.

2005
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,960
I think there was one on Nintendo 64, and there most recently came out one,

2006
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:42,960
I want to say on PS2, was it?

2007
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:43,960
I don't seek out these games.

2008
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,960
They're still making Eva games, so just look online.

2009
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,960
The Pachinko game's the best one. Go for that.

2010
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,960
Anyway, he says he is learning Japanese, so importing is not a problem.

2011
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,960
Okay. If it has that crazy intro theme from the anime, it gets bonus points.

2012
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:58,960
Sure, they all do.

2013
01:36:58,960 --> 01:36:59,960
They all do.

2014
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:05,960
In fact, I can tell you from experience that at least one of the Saturn ones has a full opening,

2015
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:06,960
like it was an episode.

2016
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,960
It's set up like an episode, basically.

2017
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:14,960
I would make him ask for himself, but I'm still working on converting him to OLR goodness.

2018
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,960
You guys and Gal are great.

2019
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,960
Your funny kicks my brain, and I enjoy it every week via podcast.

2020
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,960
Someday I will listen live. That is not a threat. It's a promise.

2021
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:26,960
PS, Dark Sakura, why do you hate Ayanami?

2022
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:32,960
Because she's boring and has the personality of a bed sheet, and Asuka could kick her ass.

2023
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,960
I have no idea what you're talking about, but it's funny.

2024
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,960
She's a clone girl with no personality.

2025
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:42,960
PPS, I hope I avoided the grammar attack. That was scary.

2026
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:47,960
Well...

2027
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:52,960
Let me distract the grammar Nazi, Dark Sakura, with some chat comments.

2028
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,960
The last email generated a lot of chat comments talking about the kids wanting to sell back his Wii.

2029
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,960
Skylark in chat says, fuck my Wii.

2030
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,960
I haven't played it in four months. Can't sell it, though.

2031
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,960
Spent $300 on Virtual Console.

2032
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,960
Then again, I've probably sold quite a bit, or I've probably bought a lot on that, too.

2033
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,960
Skylark also continues to say, only good for a party environment.

2034
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:19,960
TheRobD says, some other family wants it. Think of the children. Sell your Wii.

2035
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:22,960
Is anyone thinking of the children?

2036
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,960
ActDeaf would like to point out that bed sheets are warm and sometimes comfy.

2037
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,960
That's only when worn by other bodies.

2038
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:33,960
Okay, she has the personality of a...

2039
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:34,960
Of a gnat.

2040
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,960
No, of a stalactite.

2041
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:39,960
Because she's kind of a drip.

2042
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:40,960
Alright, move on.

2043
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,960
How's that?

2044
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,960
Okay, moving forward.

2045
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,960
There's actually a little bit more. He signed it.

2046
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:54,960
By Zanovore, yes I eat aliens, munch munch crunch crunch slurp gulp happy.

2047
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,960
Thank you. At least it's not an Olive Garden reference.

2048
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:02,960
TheRobD is referencing Pax, saying, I must say the Dark Sakura was cool to meet in person,

2049
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:08,960
but after finding out how much she likes Gachamon and hates Rayonami,

2050
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,960
he says, Dark Sakura plus plus.

2051
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:11,960
Oh, thank you.

2052
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:13,960
Next email.

2053
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:18,960
I think it's time to check how the Eye of Judgment is doing in sales, don't you?

2054
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,960
I listened to you guys to put me to sleep.

2055
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,960
No, no, you're not that boring.

2056
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:25,960
Hey, wait a minute.

2057
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,960
Let me finish. No, you're not that boring. It's just more entertaining than music.

2058
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,960
And I have not heard anything on the Eye of Judgment.

2059
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,960
Is it just me or did you forget?

2060
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,960
Sincerely is Richard, AKA the Doctor, AKA XGC the Doctor, AKA that one guy.

2061
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:44,960
Okay. Look, it's not going to sell a million.

2062
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,960
I hate to break it to you, but I will look up the numbers right now.

2063
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,960
Well, Dark Sakura reads the next email.

2064
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,960
Hey, OLR. Tae Ban here from Kenya.

2065
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,960
I haven't been able to take a picture of Samara's cafe yet, but the pic is coming.

2066
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:02,960
I finally bought a Nintendo DS, so I'm looking for some recommendations on some RPGs I should import for the system.

2067
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,960
Sorry for the shortness of my email, but I'm typing this out on my iPhone.

2068
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:10,960
Thanks for the read on your show. Tae Ban... I can't pronounce it right.

2069
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,960
Yeah, how are those iPhone sales doing in Kenya?

2070
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,960
They're all over the place.

2071
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,960
This message is brought to you by Kenya, home of the never-ending mud walls.

2072
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:20,960
P.S. this isn't my email address. I was banned from Gmail.

2073
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,960
You can't get banned from Gmail. The guy is following me on Twitter. It's a lie.

2074
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,960
Admit why you are lying. Why do you do this?

2075
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,960
I just think it's funny.

2076
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,960
I know, I know.

2077
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,960
The world ends with you.

2078
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:40,960
Eye of Judgement, 220,000.22 million. So you're just over one fifth of the way there.

2079
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,960
Final Fantasy VI.

2080
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,960
And then watch out for the Kenyans because they run really fast according to that one commercial.

2081
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,960
Okay, next email.

2082
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,960
How goes it? It goes.

2083
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:56,960
So yeah, I tried to make some sense when typing, but I'm horrid with punctuation and grammar in general.

2084
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,960
It's not something... This is the one that I sort of savaged before.

2085
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:07,960
It's not something I really picked up on and was in trouble a lot as a kid when you were supposed to learn all that stuff.

2086
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:12,960
Well, that being said, it's me, Glider, aka the 56k-er. Just had a few things to mention.

2087
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:18,960
A little bit pissed about digital life this year. I've been going for the past few years, gonna miss it this year, but oh well.

2088
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:24,960
Speaking of Jet Set Radio, one of my personal faves, another unusual skating game that was on PlayStation 2, Yaya Caballista.

2089
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:31,960
Okay, City Skater. I played the crap out of it and was good very close to Jet Set Radio.

2090
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,960
It could use a little skateboard that you put on the analog stick and held the controller sideways.

2091
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,960
Very painful on the thumbs, but nonetheless fun.

2092
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,960
I'm really good at reading run-in sentences, aren't I?

2093
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:45,960
Dot dot dot dot dot dot dot. Oh yes, I remember what else I was going to say. Rob!

2094
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:49,960
He put it all in caps, so I had to say it that way.

2095
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:58,960
I heard you crack the dial-up joke. 56k-er has been my handle for almost 15 years now, so I'm not giving it up, even though I do have high-speed broadband.

2096
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:05,960
20 megabytes down and 8 megabytes up. It's about avga these days. It's average these days.

2097
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:13,960
But real quick, I did used to use Shotgun to 56k modems, sync them and dial out to different services with the same login.

2098
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:17,960
But it's also a good way to blow out your mobile modems.

2099
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,960
Look, at least you're not the 300-botter.

2100
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:27,960
Because when I was on the Commodore 64 back in the day calling BBS's, 300-bod, yo. 300-bod.

2101
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:33,960
Anyway, keep up the good work, catch you guys later. P.S. Jamie, I'm really trying to have better grammar and punctuation. Please, please don't eat me.

2102
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:41,960
You know what? Just remember that when your sentence ends, use a period.

2103
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:48,960
Or if you're excited, use an exclamation point. Or if you're asking a question, you use a question mark.

2104
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,960
And then when you start your new sentence, you use the big letters.

2105
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,960
By the way, that 300-bod modem about the size of a Neo Geo cartridge. No joke.

2106
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:57,960
God, really? I know.

2107
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,960
Next email. We have three left.

2108
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:00,960
Hello, this is...

2109
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:01,960
Three?

2110
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,960
You know what?

2111
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:08,960
What? Oh, it's fine. We don't have a lot of stories left, so this fills time.

2112
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:15,960
This is Blade 3. I just want to say I'm a long time listener and I've never called in, but I'm going to try this weekend. Yes, please do.

2113
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:20,960
Also wanted to ask your opinion about Counter Strike Source and Knights of the Old Republic. KOTOR!

2114
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:25,960
If you've played them. Sorry about my bad grammar, I'm using my PSP. That's okay, yours are still better than the last email.

2115
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:30,960
I also wanted to tell Loki that I'm very impressed with the PSP OLR site. It is so good.

2116
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:35,960
On that note, I would like to ask his permission to use the source code for my own PSP site.

2117
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:40,960
The name and images and links and stuff would be different, but I'm having trouble with formatting, so it would be handy.

2118
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,960
Thanks, good show as always. Keep it up.

2119
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:47,960
P.S. My site would be primarily used for PSP downloads such as videos, wallpapers, and demos directly to the PSP.

2120
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:51,960
Well, Loki is not here to answer that question, so you'll have to ask him later.

2121
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:55,960
Yeah, and he left chat. You can always email him, though. He likes getting emails. Loki at Orange House...

2122
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:56,960
He loves email.

2123
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:57,960
He loves email.

2124
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:58,960
A lot of them.

2125
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:59,960
Yeah.

2126
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:00,960
Especially email about My Little Pony.

2127
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,960
Uh-huh, and if you sign him up for Porn Mail List, he'll love that.

2128
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,960
Oh, he loves it so much. It's so much fun.

2129
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:11,960
Actually, we shouldn't be encouraging folks to do that, because our website administrator probably would frown on that, so yeah, don't actually do that.

2130
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:12,960
He would send us big frowny faces.

2131
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:19,960
Actually, as far as KOTOR, I'm sorry, I had a friend who used to playtest that, and I got too used to hearing her calling it Scrotor,

2132
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:26,960
so I have no ideas about the name, except I've been watching UdonKru's art that they've been putting up on DeviantArt, and it looks pretty cool.

2133
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:31,960
Well, when I have no opinion on the game, I mean, KOTOR's okay from what I've seen of it. What was the other one, Counter Strike?

2134
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:32,960
Counter Strike Source.

2135
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:37,960
Not my type of game, but Loki's. See, it's the one where Loki wasn't here, because he really plays that.

2136
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,960
But when I don't really play the game, I turn to chat, and the Rob D says,

2137
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:46,960
Source was just fun, KOTOR was revolutionary for Star Wars games, and revitalized them for a little while.

2138
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,960
There you have it.

2139
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:55,960
I just kept hearing about, this game is buggy, I hate this glitch, because my friend knew.

2140
01:44:55,960 --> 01:45:01,960
Hey guys, I would like to comment on a story topic you folks talked about on your last show.

2141
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,960
I would have called in them, but your 800 number was down at the time.

2142
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:12,960
In regards to the story about the We Wooked reworked Space Invaders game that was done for art slash commentary purposes,

2143
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,960
I feel pretty much as Jamie does, I know, because I'm right all the time.

2144
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:20,960
I would just like to add my own two cents in the form of two rhetorical questions.

2145
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,960
You know how the First Amendment to our Bill of Rights guarantees us the right to free speech?

2146
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:29,960
Well, what amendment guarantees the right to not be offended? Oh yeah, there isn't one.

2147
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:34,960
Honestly, the whiny little fucker that was pissing and moaning about this issue really needs to get a grip.

2148
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:41,960
Not only that, but if I was in the guy's shoes and the guys that did the exhibit, I probably would not have only kept the exhibit up.

2149
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:45,960
I would have most likely cobbled together some of them together as a response to the whining.

2150
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:50,960
I don't know, something along the lines of the player actually bringing the terrorists flying planes into twin towers,

2151
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,960
but change the plane into a flying pair of boobs or some phallic symbol instead of a plane.

2152
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,960
Some of y'all are just vindictive like that.

2153
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,960
I know, it's great.

2154
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:04,960
Plus add a severed head, rampant cursing, a straight couple having sex, and two men kissing.

2155
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,960
All of this would be a roundabout way of saying fuck you to the whiners.

2156
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:10,960
One more thing that relates to this that I just remembered.

2157
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:20,960
The original intention of free speech in the First Amendment was to protect the voiced opinions of those who are in a minority in a given issue.

2158
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:27,960
No, I don't mean like race or anything, but I mean like those people who have unpopular views like the KKK, people who think bin Laden is cool, etc.

2159
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:30,960
Face it, not everyone has the same views slash opinions, etc.

2160
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,960
Thanks for reading this. Have a good one.

2161
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,960
Honestly, that's perfectly right.

2162
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:46,960
Everybody, no matter how offensive or distasteful their opinions are, as long as they are a citizen or at least legally living within this country,

2163
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:55,960
they do have a right to voice that opinion as long as they do so in an appropriate way.

2164
01:46:55,960 --> 01:47:01,960
You know what I mean? Like you can't, there are some places, especially private ground, where people are not going to allow some people to say things,

2165
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:08,960
and that's, you know, a private organization may not let somebody from an outside source say something on their property,

2166
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:15,960
but in the United States, we do have freedom of speech, even if it is unpopular and people are wrong.

2167
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:17,960
Everyone's got a right to an opinion.

2168
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,960
I had to really think for a minute what that email was even about because it's been so long.

2169
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:25,960
You know, like two weeks ever since spending arcade expo.

2170
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:30,960
By the way, speaking of the last email, because chat's a little bit behind,

2171
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:38,960
Loki actually popped in chat to respond to the last email because he says, sorry, I'm not in chat, but I'm listening to the stream.

2172
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,960
And he says in response to the last email, sorry, I'm not giving out the source code for the site.

2173
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,960
But, you know, he did work really hard on it. He did earn it.

2174
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:50,960
But I do want to say this. Maybe if you could get Loki that chat thing he's been looking for, that other guy won't give up.

2175
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,960
Maybe he'll make a trade. Maybe. I'm just hypothesizing.

2176
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:56,960
Loki does go on to say, I've never played Counter Strike.

2177
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:00,960
And no prawn email, please. I get enough spam in my OLR email.

2178
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,960
He's lying. He loves the porn. Just kidding.

2179
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,960
Last email?

2180
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:07,960
It's true. We all get a lot of spam in our Orange Launch Radio boxes.

2181
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:08,960
That's why I deleted mine.

2182
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:09,960
Jerks.

2183
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:11,960
All right. Yeah. This. Last email, please.

2184
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:17,960
Okay. Hey, guys. I would like to comment on a story slash topic you folks have talked about on your last show.

2185
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:18,960
I would have...

2186
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:19,960
No. No comment.

2187
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,960
Duh.

2188
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,960
I just read this one.

2189
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:22,960
Did you? Oh.

2190
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:23,960
Yeah.

2191
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:26,960
Hey, OLR. Are you having a super special awesome Sunday?

2192
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,960
Cookies for those who know the reference.

2193
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,960
So, anyways, I was downloading some old podcasts from the OLR archive when you guys were away for a week.

2194
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:39,960
And I can safely say that you have been a really great podcast throughout the years.

2195
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:44,960
It was funny comparing your old expectations from the next gen consoles to your usual and your usual antics.

2196
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:50,960
By the way, DMN Elibits is not a Katamari killer minus two... minus... oh, that's episode 200. Sorry.

2197
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:55,960
To finish, I was at Blockbuster today and saw copies of DDRX and DDR Hottest Party 2 bundles.

2198
01:48:55,960 --> 01:49:01,960
Since the release date is September 16th for both games, can retail stores sell the games beforehand?

2199
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:02,960
Not technically.

2200
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,960
Or does it really apply to street dates?

2201
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:08,960
I was mulling over this when DDR Supernova came out earlier two years ago.

2202
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,960
Anyway, great job at PAX, and here's to another great episode.

2203
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,960
This is from Katamari's Forever.

2204
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:17,960
Sometimes, too, the bundles and the game by itself come out at different times.

2205
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:20,960
That's something really important to keep in mind. That's what's going to be happening with Rock Band 2.

2206
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:26,960
Rock Band 2 is coming out as a standalone game on the 360 for about a month until you start seeing the bundles hit streets.

2207
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,960
So always keep that in mind when you see those types of things out in the wild, too.

2208
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:36,960
P.S. It's my birthday at the time of reading this, September 7th, so it would really make my day if you read this, thank you.

2209
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:37,960
Happy birthday!

2210
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,960
Happy damn birthday! Cha-cha-cha.

2211
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:46,960
And in closing, if a Yaris crashes in the middle of nowhere and no one hears it, does the crappy game still exist?

2212
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:47,960
Sadly, yes.

2213
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:50,960
You know, I'm actually thinking of getting a Yaris. I'm going to be buying a new car for Christmas.

2214
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:56,960
That's going to be my Christmas present to myself, I've decided, because my previous Toyota I've had since 2001.

2215
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,960
And it's 98, so it officially turned 10 years old this year.

2216
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,960
It's been abused.

2217
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,960
It's done. It's time to put a gunshot in it and lay it down for a little while.

2218
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:08,960
I'm actually thinking about a Yaris. I love Toyotas.

2219
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:13,960
If Rob gets one, that means if he gives us a ride somewhere, we can just say we're taking a ride in this crappy game.

2220
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:18,960
Yep. Bring all the jokes on that you want. I'm really, really considering it.

2221
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,960
Heart! Done!

2222
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,960
Alright, no more emails.

2223
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,960
Mailbag at OrangeLauncherDude.com if you want to get him for next week.

2224
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,960
And yes, open the floodgates of Chatroom. Not going to be for wanting to get a Yaris.

2225
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,960
Even if there were more emails? I'm not reading them!

2226
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:39,960
You know, I could say I'm coming on here and getting any car and somebody would taunt me for my choice.

2227
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:40,960
Get a Lancer.

2228
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,960
I'm just going to have to do my own research. No.

2229
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,960
Get a Lancer.

2230
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:44,960
No.

2231
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:45,960
Lancer.

2232
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:46,960
No.

2233
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:47,960
Lancer's the best cars ever.

2234
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:48,960
Lies.

2235
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:49,960
Truth.

2236
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:52,960
Alright, this is going to be the best game ever.

2237
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,960
It's on the Nintendo DS. It's from Ubisoft, so you already know this is a winner.

2238
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,960
And Cesar Millan, do you know what he does?

2239
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,960
He talks to dogs.

2240
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,960
Yes, he's the dog whisperer.

2241
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,960
See, either you knew that because you actually know it, in which case I'm going to make fun of you.

2242
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:10,960
Or you knew that because you looked over here at my screen, in which case I'm going to pitch you.

2243
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:11,960
Or at Red Show Roll.

2244
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:12,960
Oh, okay.

2245
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,960
Well, that's what he does. He's the dog whisperer.

2246
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:18,960
You know, like the horse whisperer, but with dogs.

2247
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:21,960
And yes, they're making a game out of it.

2248
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:26,960
I'm leaving that pause for you to contemplate what this means for gaming.

2249
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,960
Nintendogs it ain't, that's for sure.

2250
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,960
It is actually a TV show on National Geographic Channel.

2251
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:37,960
It was rated by the ESRB, and then it kind of slipped away for a little while.

2252
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,960
Well, now there's box art. It is really happening.

2253
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,960
And a PC version.

2254
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:46,960
No idea what exactly you do in this game, but damn if you...

2255
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:52,960
I mean, I know they say don't judge a game by its cover, but for real, how can I not?

2256
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:56,960
It's a freaking dog whisperer game.

2257
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,960
Please.

2258
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,960
This game has been judged.

2259
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,960
Gong.

2260
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:03,960
There you have it.

2261
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:05,960
The end, dog whisperer.

2262
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:08,960
Game Guru says, sounds like another crappy Ubisoft game.

2263
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,960
That's what most people are saying, actually.

2264
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:10,960
Sounds like dog poo.

2265
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,960
Yeah, the dog pooper.

2266
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,960
Poobysoft, says Frisbee.

2267
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:15,960
I like that.

2268
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:20,960
That should be their new name, Poobysoft, whenever they have a crappy game we're talking about on the show.

2269
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:21,960
I like that.

2270
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,960
Don't forget that Poobysoft.

2271
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:29,960
Loki's in chat and says it's not as bad as travel games for dummies on the DS and the My Stop Smoking coach.

2272
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:34,960
I want to say we talked about that My Stop Smoking coach a few weeks ago when it was first announced.

2273
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,960
That isn't nearly as bad as the freaking dog whisperer.

2274
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:41,960
I see a lot of potential for My Stop Smoking, but dog whisperer?

2275
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,960
Really?

2276
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,960
Really?

2277
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,960
Really?

2278
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,960
Dog whisperer.

2279
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:51,960
How?

2280
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:54,960
Pluckyguy wants to see a Dog the Bounty Hunter game.

2281
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,960
I don't know about that. He's a controversial individual. I don't know if you've heard the stories.

2282
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:01,960
Alright, new story, new story.

2283
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:04,960
Next story has to do with Space Invaders!

2284
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,960
The keyboard.

2285
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:10,960
They have made a Space Invaders keyboard.

2286
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:19,960
And it has little letters on top of the little aliens on the keys and you really can't see them that well unless you're staring at them.

2287
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,960
And then it has the shooty thing on the space bar.

2288
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:28,960
It's a Space Invaders keyboard for PC.

2289
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:33,960
I don't know what else I can say about this. It's a Space Invaders keyboard.

2290
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:41,960
Look at the bright side. At least this time, unlike the last time we discussed Space Invaders on this show, there's no 9-11 references on this keyboard, correct?

2291
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:45,960
I just put a picture of it in the chatroom. It's a Space Invaders keyboard.

2292
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:48,960
Is the keyboard 9-11 reference free?

2293
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:51,960
Yeah, but it's a Space Invaders keyboard.

2294
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,960
That should be a sticker they put on the box.

2295
01:53:53,960 --> 01:54:01,960
You know what I'm going to do when my keyboard dies, especially after I punch it in the face, well, if it had a face, for the stupid fucking drivers not working?

2296
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:03,960
Thank God I'm moving to Linux.

2297
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:06,960
I'm going to repaint it.

2298
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,960
Just for fun?

2299
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,960
I'm going to paint a big Pac-Man on it.

2300
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:13,960
You should paint fire on it.

2301
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:15,960
I'm going to paint Pac-Man on it, even dots.

2302
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:16,960
Paint Pac-Man on fire.

2303
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,960
Paint your butt on fire.

2304
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:21,960
What? I didn't eat Chipotle today.

2305
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:29,960
Oh God, you know this show's hit rock bottom when we start making poopy jokes.

2306
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:31,960
Anyhow.

2307
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:32,960
Dart making?

2308
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:37,960
By the way, what a great lead-in to our next story, speaking of a lowest common denominator jokes.

2309
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:40,960
I was going to say speaking of flaming butt.

2310
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:48,960
Every time the lowest common denominator gets brought up, especially in games, you can't help but reference the game Choeniki.

2311
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:54,960
And if you don't know why Choeniki, just Google it. Just Google it and you'll see why.

2312
01:54:54,960 --> 01:55:00,960
Here's the thing. Choeniki is, this might come as a shock to you, the game is out on Virtual Console in Japan.

2313
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,960
It actually came out in Europe as well.

2314
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,960
Here's the thing.

2315
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:10,960
It's been rated by the ESRB.

2316
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,960
That would be the American board.

2317
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,960
They rated it E10 for mild suggestive themes.

2318
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,960
No, here's the other thing.

2319
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,960
It's been dated for Monday.

2320
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:23,960
I'm downloading Choeniki.

2321
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:32,960
By the time you hear this episode, if this story isn't bullshit, which when the ESRB is involved in, you may be able to play Choeniki on Virtual Console in America.

2322
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,960
The unthinkable has happened.

2323
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:37,960
Jamie has been so excited she dropped her mic.

2324
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:42,960
I'm happy. Choeniki is so much fun.

2325
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:46,960
I think it's kind of gay, actually.

2326
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,960
It is very, very, very gay.

2327
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,960
But in a good way.

2328
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:54,960
If you actually go and say, this game is gay, I'm actually going to agree with you.

2329
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,960
I'm going to be like, yep, it is gay.

2330
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:07,960
This game totally does it with other games of the same gender.

2331
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:10,960
Frisbee says it is on the Nintendo website.

2332
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:12,960
It's happening.

2333
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:17,960
And by the way, as if you care, Final Soldier is also supposed to come out tomorrow.

2334
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:20,960
Seriously, everything sucks compared to Choeniki.

2335
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:24,960
By the way, since we weren't here last week, we might want to mention some other games hit Virtual Console.

2336
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:29,960
Clu Clu Land, if you like strange floating objects with hooks trying to reveal coins.

2337
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:33,960
I actually played this game a lot in Animal Crossing, because it was one of the games you could get in your house.

2338
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,960
And then this little game, I don't know if you've heard of it.

2339
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,960
Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars.

2340
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:39,960
You ever heard of that game?

2341
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:40,960
Sweet!

2342
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:44,960
I think I read an article on it once in Nintendo Power, like in the back of the magazine.

2343
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,960
It is available now on Virtual Console.

2344
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,960
And boy was that a quiet release.

2345
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,960
It just came out on Labor Day while everyone was out of town.

2346
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:53,960
You know what I mean?

2347
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:58,960
It's kind of a little stealth release there, but I know a lot of people have been waiting for that in all seriousness.

2348
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,960
Legend of the Seven Stars, finally available on the Virtual Console for download.

2349
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,960
And as Loki in chat says, and I'm sure he would say if he were here in studio right now,

2350
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:10,960
Motherfucking Super Mario RPG!

2351
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:15,960
Word, Loki. Word.

2352
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:17,960
So, to continue on.

2353
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:19,960
Yes, more- Choaniki 2?

2354
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:20,960
No!

2355
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:21,960
Well, Tipo does want to point out-

2356
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:22,960
Sheet music!

2357
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:27,960
The first Choaniki game is the tamest in the series, and it is the first game.

2358
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:28,960
Sheet music, Rob. Sheet music.

2359
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,960
Yes, sheet music. What the sheet?

2360
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,960
Uh-huh-huh.

2361
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:39,960
Well, it's sheet music that is titled Killer Instinct 3 Main Title.

2362
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:47,960
It could be a fake, it could be photoshoppity, but it's been found somewhere.

2363
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:52,960
And it says, uh, a Killer Instinct 3-

2364
01:57:52,960 --> 01:58:00,960
And by the way, if anyone wants to hop out their MIDI recorder, it actually looks fairly complex, and I can't play that high, so whatever.

2365
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,960
I'm surprised nobody's tried to turn it into a MIDI file yet.

2366
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:06,960
But here's the thing, what if it's just printed out from Cakewalk?

2367
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:10,960
Like, it's not that hard to make a fake song and print it out with a fake title.

2368
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:11,960
Probably.

2369
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:15,960
I just, I don't know, I think it's, my BS meter is going off the charts on this.

2370
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:18,960
But you remember the Christmas card thing that Rare did before?

2371
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:19,960
Uh-huh.

2372
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:21,960
With the KI3 Christmas card?

2373
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:22,960
Mm-hmm.

2374
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:33,960
Well, there was that, now we have this music, and now there were other rumors that were floating around, like there was the Fulgore picture, remember?

2375
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:34,960
Yeah.

2376
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,960
So, it could happen.

2377
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,960
And it could not.

2378
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:39,960
I liked Killer Instinct.

2379
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:41,960
Me too, don't get me wrong, but I don't know.

2380
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:45,960
You know, that would be a hell of an announcement, maybe in 2009, we'll see.

2381
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:47,960
But I don't know, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

2382
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:57,960
I would love nothing more than this, but I can't help but feel like this is a fake, and we're all getting our legs pulled on this one, and I don't like being fooled.

2383
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:58,960
Are we being kill rolled?

2384
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:01,960
Yes, we're being kill rolled, and I don't like being lied to.

2385
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:05,960
And when I feel like I'm being lied to, whether I'm being lied to or not, I get kind of angsty.

2386
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:08,960
And when I get angsty, the FUs of the week happen.

2387
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:30,960
My FU of the week goes to the man with the small penis driving the truck that uses too much gas at the shopping center where I got my Starbucks from.

2388
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:33,960
Stop doing cocaine!

2389
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:39,960
Stop doing cocaine!

2390
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:41,960
I don't know how much I should say.

2391
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:47,960
My FU of the week goes to a particular individual I'm thinking of.

2392
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:51,960
No, I don't want to say it, because if you give it attention, it only grows.

2393
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:59,960
A particular individual I'm thinking of that really, really needs to stop stalking me.

2394
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:04,960
And this isn't a joke. It's not an OLR listener thing. It's something going on in my real life.

2395
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:12,960
I honestly feel like I'm being stalked by a certain individual that needs to cut the shit out and just move on with themselves, because it's so frustrating.

2396
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:21,960
Stop being immature. Grow up. Grow up. Grow up!

2397
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:23,960
That's it.

2398
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:24,960
I guess that's it, huh?

2399
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,960
Yeah, there's no one else here. Just you and me.

2400
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:29,960
Well, I'm sure that...

2401
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:31,960
Well, then I guess I'll do another story, huh?

2402
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:32,960
I was going to say so.

2403
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:41,960
All right. Xbox Live. Hey, if I want to take my aggressions out on something, I could punch people, and I will be able to do that in King of Fighters 98.

2404
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:44,960
This game is going to Xbox Live Arcade. You know, Fatal Fury...

2405
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,960
I have several versions of that game.

2406
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:56,960
Fatal Fury Special was on Xbox Live Arcade. I don't know if you all remember, but I guess it did well enough that Neo Geo and SNK, they're going to try it again with King of Fighters 98 going to Xbox Live Arcade.

2407
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:04,960
It is coming out. It's been re-released on the PlayStation 2 already. There were some extra features, like character balancing, and some new fighters on it.

2408
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,960
Hopefully the Xbox Live version will have all of this, too.

2409
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:12,960
There is no word of a release date yet, but sometime soon.

2410
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:20,960
Probably before the end of the year, I'd imagine. King of Fighters 98 on Virtual Console. I might have to check that out. We'll see.

2411
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:31,960
Well, in other news, and this makes me specifically happy, and this is what actually brought it to my attention, is that one of my Live Journal friends linked the trailer for Dissidia Final Fantasy.

2412
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:46,960
There's a YouTube video up, but basically it's a dramatic progressive action that's supposed to be like a fighting game with an RPG element, I think.

2413
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:50,960
But you move through a field map, and then you have to fight different people.

2414
02:01:50,960 --> 02:02:02,960
It's sort of actually, some of the fighting sequences are actually a lot like what was in Kingdom Hearts 2, where you run up walls and do all kinds of special stuff and earn points.

2415
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:08,960
But the cool thing about this is actually who the characters in the games are.

2416
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:18,960
Actually, you've got your villains and your heroes. You've got the Warrior of Light from Final Fantasy versus Garland. You have Frienel from Final Fantasy 2, Onion Knight.

2417
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:36,960
They've shown Squall and Zidane and Tidus. There's also, for some of the villains, there was the Emperor from Final Fantasy 2, Cloud of Darkness, Golbez, Exdeath, Kefka, Sephiroth, Ultimecia, Kuja, and Jecht from the other ones.

2418
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:47,960
I'm sure there's going to be more people from the other Final Fantasy games, some of the heroes coming into it, but I think that's going to be pretty cool. I'm looking forward to it.

2419
02:02:47,960 --> 02:03:00,960
I have to say, my inner fanboy is very pleased. This game's been a little bit off the radar, but it looks hot. I really want to check this out when it comes out, and I hate admitting that. You know what I mean? But this game looks awesome.

2420
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:08,960
It's supposed to be all the major heroes versus the major villains. It has freaking Garland in it. That's awesome.

2421
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:17,960
Nomura is doing the character designs, but trying to keep some of Amano's style to it, at least since some of the characters are.

2422
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:31,960
But they also said they used Jecht instead of Seymour for the Final Fantasy X references so they didn't have to put Yuna in it. I don't know.

2423
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:37,960
Well, there'd be too many people that would get too big of a thrill out of punching Yuna in the face, sadly. Sorry, Yuna fans.

2424
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:43,960
And they said that it's actually supposed to have twice as much dialogue as Crisis Core.

2425
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:47,960
Dang. All right. This could be fun. We'll see.

2426
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:49,960
I'm hoping so.

2427
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:58,960
All right. Well, another game that could be fun, Warhammer Online. As you noticed, if you're listening to part A, I had some fairly favorable things to say about the game during my little review of it.

2428
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:02,960
I played it at Penny Arcade Expo, and a lot of you have been getting the chance to check this out, too.

2429
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:13,960
The open beta launched this weekend playing Warhammer Online. The beta launched earlier this morning. Now, of course, it hasn't gone without some flaws.

2430
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:19,960
Apparently, some of the folks outside the United States are having a heck of a time trying to get a Warhammer Online, and they're not happy.

2431
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:26,960
And also, apparently, some problems with the server even here in the US. Some folks are having problems getting in, but that's what happens when thousands of people hit this.

2432
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:34,960
That's what a beta is for. It is a test process. And AK Ripper is in chat, and I even heard him on Bobby just before we went live. He was complaining about this.

2433
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,960
And he's in there right now saying, not working. So, yeah, it looks like there's a lot of problems with it.

2434
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:44,960
But in theory, the beta is open, but it's probably just going to take a couple days for it to be ironed out.

2435
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:53,960
But you know what? Let's look at the long-term thing. It's better this happened now than the day the game is actually supposed to come out and be on shelves and be out there for everybody, right?

2436
02:04:53,960 --> 02:05:01,960
Is it just me? I don't know. I'd rather this happen now. But of course, then again, if I were one of these people trying to work my butt off to get in, I would probably also be pretty pissed.

2437
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:08,960
Especially if I just happen to be outside the United States. That's never cool to get the shaft because of where you live.

2438
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:14,960
But in theory, it's up. Hopefully, it'll get ironed out in the next couple days. We'll see.

2439
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:24,960
Skype line will be open very soon at www.orangelaunchradio.com. Click on interact with us. Our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio or 1-877-GAMO-LR in the US and Canada.

2440
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:36,960
For people who are interested in Call of Duty 5, at least as far as our European listeners, the World at War multiplayer beta will be out for PC and Xbox 360 in October.

2441
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:43,960
The PS3 one has not yet been announced. There's a chance it may not happen and nothing about Wii.

2442
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:52,960
So, it will be... they say the boot camp will open its doors and they haven't named a date yet.

2443
02:05:52,960 --> 02:06:01,960
But the speculation, though, would be November 14th for the actual release date.

2444
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:08,960
So, they're thinking that it would probably correspond with the US one.

2445
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:17,960
At any rate, you'll be able to use the squad system, be able to try some of the other new modes in it, the multiplayer mode.

2446
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:28,960
So, it'll be pretty cool and I'd like to see what people think about it. Call of Duty 4 was really freaking cool, so I have high expectations for Call of Duty 5.

2447
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:41,960
Alright, well hopefully Call of Duty 5 does not disappoint. Well, that's just about all the video game news we have tonight, but there is one more story about something kind of related to video game and it's something I actually checked out this week.

2448
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:50,960
A new site launched. Now, you know, you've got your MySpace, you've got your Facebook, you've got your Twitter, of which, by the way, Orange Launch Radio is on all of those, your live journals and so on.

2449
02:06:50,960 --> 02:07:00,960
And I'm sure you're thinking, damn, I need another social networking site. Well, another one has launched. It's called Raptor, R-A-P-T-R.

2450
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:06,960
Notice there's no O in that. It's just R-A-P-T-R is a new social gaming network site.

2451
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:13,960
Here's how it works is basically you punch in all the various codes you have, your Wii code, your Xbox code, your Guitar Hero code.

2452
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:25,960
You can also download an optional PC client. And basically what it does is the service kind of watches you on all of these various sites and it tracks all of your gaming progress, so to speak, on one site.

2453
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:33,960
Also, it'll let your friends know when you're online and playing games. So if you're actually using the free PC client, like folks can see when I'm playing World of Warcraft.

2454
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:42,960
So if you're kind of one of those people that always has a hard time, you know, finding friends to play online games with or whatever, whenever they're online, Raptor could be an option.

2455
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:49,960
I definitely want to know more about this site. I'm going to try and get the folks to come on the show, the folks behind Raptor, so we'll see what happens in the upcoming weeks.

2456
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:56,960
But yeah, if you want to check it out, the beta is now open, but it is still a beta, so you know it might break, but it's raptor.com.

2457
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:05,960
But be careful because sometimes they ask for your Twitter address and stuff. If you put that info in there, it's going to post on Twitter every time you go in to launch a game, and I think that could get very annoying.

2458
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:12,960
So I did not link it to my Twitter for that reason. So be careful when you think about those things because these sites really try to get you to link to everything.

2459
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:20,960
And you know, they're just trying to hoard out to as many people as possible so that they can get their numbers up and to possibly sell ads or whatever they're going to do in the future.

2460
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:28,960
But it could be interesting. So we'll see, we'll see. I really would like to get them on the show and just ask them, you know, what's the point?

2461
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:33,960
And maybe they can justify it. I imagine there's got to be a reason to it. They've had a lot of money invested in it.

2462
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:45,960
And I believe it's from one of the co-creators of... God, what was the other thing he made? I don't remember. Was it Steam? Don't quote me on that. Somebody in chat will probably remember.

2463
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:48,960
The guy made something else that was really big and popular.

2464
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:50,960
I don't remember off the top of my head.

2465
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:58,960
I don't remember either. But I signed up for it. If you want to send me a friend request, I guess so. Sky is just my name on there, just like Twitter, S-K-I-E.

2466
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:04,960
So there you go. Unless you're my stalker, then you can't add me. Sorry.

2467
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:05,960
Well.

2468
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:08,960
Because I don't need that person finding me in Warcraft.

2469
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:15,960
All right. Are there any last minute stories in the house tonight before we open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR?

2470
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:16,960
I have none.

2471
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:20,960
You have none. I think I might have one. I'll get to it in a little bit. But let's do some calls first.

2472
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:23,960
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2473
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:24,960
GS68 here.

2474
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,960
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

2475
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:29,960
Last week, I got around to playing Street Fighter IV.

2476
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:31,960
And what did you think of Street Fighter IV?

2477
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:36,960
Well, I didn't really play it much, so I don't know much about the game mechanics and stuff.

2478
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:46,960
But in the first thing, you see the graphics, and they're really nice. My complaint is that the male fighters look a little too muscular.

2479
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:52,960
Do the female fighters have too big of boobies? Like everything is really overemphasized or what?

2480
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:53,960
I'm not sure.

2481
02:09:53,960 --> 02:10:00,960
One thing I liked about the setup here at San Jose State was that they had two cabinets, and they're linked up, so that way...

2482
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:07,960
Which is good because not only does each player have their own cabinet, like those Japanese cabinets, but...

2483
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:18,960
You can also play one-player mode if someone else is already playing in this mode called beginner mode, and it basically lets you go three rounds without anyone challenging you.

2484
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,960
Which is nice because I suck at fighting games.

2485
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:27,960
Give us an idea, how big is this game? I mean, were there just tons and tons of people there to play?

2486
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:34,960
There's always people playing. Usually around four or five people, at the least.

2487
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:39,960
Is this game really getting out there? I mean, I've been so distracted by all the other goings on in the PAX world and all that.

2488
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:43,960
I haven't really been following, but I know it was really big when it got into a couple arcades.

2489
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:48,960
Is it slowly finding its way into more and more and more places where it's not too hard to find now?

2490
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:56,960
I'm not sure. I had to go down there, only until I went down there to discover that we finally have Street Fighter IV here in the Bay Area.

2491
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:07,960
I mean, as I've said before, the arcade scene is dying. I mean, new arcade games tend to catch the gaming community as a whole by surprise these days.

2492
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:14,960
Whereas for games on PC and console, we know exactly when they come out, so there's no surprise to that.

2493
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:18,960
I do want to point out in chat, IkumaJP has some comments about the Street Fighter IV graphics.

2494
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:22,960
Says, the muscle is good, and Chun-Li has an elephant leg.

2495
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:25,960
So her legs are even thicker than ever?

2496
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:30,960
Chun-Li has amazing thighs. Sheik would put Mary Lou Rhett into shame.

2497
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:31,960
There you go.

2498
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:34,960
Okay, I actually have the hentai of her.

2499
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:38,960
GS68, any other thoughts on Street Fighter IV before we get to another call?

2500
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:45,960
Um, she has something else to say, but I forgot. Oh yeah, now that Super Mario RPG is out, I can't wait for all of you game fans to complain.

2501
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:48,960
Where's my Earthbound? Where's my Earthbound?

2502
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,960
I'll start. Where's my Earthbound?

2503
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:51,960
Oh.

2504
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:54,960
Alright, have a good one, GS68. Take care, buddy.

2505
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:55,960
You too.

2506
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:56,960
Bye.

2507
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:01,960
Pluckyguy in chat says, I kinda like Chun-Li's jungle booty.

2508
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:04,960
Nothing wrong with a big butt. 1877.

2509
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:06,960
Just rub like big butts and cannot lie.

2510
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,960
You other brothers can't deny.

2511
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:10,960
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype.

2512
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:16,960
Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call here live on this Sunday evening, September the 7th of 2008.

2513
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,960
Let's go to the phones.

2514
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,960
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2515
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:24,960
Hello?

2516
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,960
Hello, hi, who's this? You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2517
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:27,960
Hello, this is Seg.

2518
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:30,960
Hey, Seg, my friend. How are you?

2519
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:32,960
I'm doing quite alright, and yourself?

2520
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:34,960
I am doing awesome.

2521
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:35,960
Hello, I met you.

2522
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:36,960
Yep.

2523
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:37,960
Yep.

2524
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:39,960
Seg was one of my buddies. He lives in the Bay Area.

2525
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,960
The cupcake shop or store, right?

2526
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:44,960
Yes, he told the cupcake story, but nobody's gonna get that.

2527
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:47,960
He also wore the manly corset one day, which was great.

2528
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,960
That was a fabulously manly corset.

2529
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:51,960
Definitely showed off your hourglass figure.

2530
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:54,960
And only three jerks that day, too.

2531
02:12:54,960 --> 02:13:01,960
I was quite surprised that there weren't as many jerks there.

2532
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:02,960
Welcomely surprised.

2533
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:05,960
You know, just be glad you weren't the guy in the Princess Peach outfit,

2534
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:07,960
because his picture got a lot of stuff.

2535
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:09,960
Okay, I have standards.

2536
02:13:09,960 --> 02:13:11,960
I don't know. You know what? You've inspired me, Seg.

2537
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:14,960
Next year, I'm gonna push the cross-dressing envelope.

2538
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:16,960
No, no, no. I wasn't cross-dressing.

2539
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:18,960
I know you weren't. I know you weren't, but I'm just saying.

2540
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,960
I'm just making sure for everyone else listening in.

2541
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:26,960
I want to incorporate a little more femininity into my outfits.

2542
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:30,960
I don't know. I just think you need to parade through the con as Frank.

2543
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:33,960
Oh, should I bring my full Frank-N-Furter regalia next year?

2544
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:34,960
Bring it.

2545
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:35,960
If they'd let me in.

2546
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,960
And you also need the curly mullet wig.

2547
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:38,960
Forget it. I'm sorry.

2548
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:41,960
Seg probably had things he wanted to talk about that aren't corsets.

2549
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:43,960
What's on your mind, Seg?

2550
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:47,960
Well, it is in the similar vein of PAX.

2551
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:49,960
I couldn't really look up for any confirmation,

2552
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:54,960
but I heard talks that PAX is thinking about doing East Coast.

2553
02:13:54,960 --> 02:14:00,960
But what I want to propose out to listeners and all that is,

2554
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:04,960
how do you think the whole convention dynamic would change

2555
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:11,960
with a major East Coast specific for video games conference?

2556
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:12,960
I do want to say this real quick.

2557
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,960
It has been confirmed by the Penny Arcade Expo organizers,

2558
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:16,960
Boston in 2010.

2559
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:18,960
They have already booked the venue, apparently.

2560
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,960
Okay. I just wasn't 100%. I forgot where I read it.

2561
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:22,960
No, that's all right.

2562
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:24,960
Timing is everything, in my opinion.

2563
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,960
I think they can get away with doing two shows in a year

2564
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:28,960
if they're really well spaced out,

2565
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:31,960
especially if it's true that they're doing it in April,

2566
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:32,960
that's not a bad time to do it

2567
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:34,960
because you have a lot of game releases.

2568
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:35,960
When are most games released?

2569
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,960
They're released in the early summer,

2570
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:38,960
or they're released right before Christmas.

2571
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:42,960
So if you have your early April show promoting those spring games,

2572
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:45,960
and you have the August show promoting the holiday games,

2573
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:47,960
which PAX is kind of doing,

2574
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:49,960
I think they can pull it off.

2575
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:53,960
I would be very curious to see, though, if it ends up kind of,

2576
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:56,960
if each con kind of eats each other,

2577
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:57,960
but maybe that's what they want.

2578
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:58,960
And when I say that, I mean, you know,

2579
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,960
is attendance going to go down at one

2580
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:02,960
because now they have this other one available,

2581
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:04,960
but maybe in a way that's what they want.

2582
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:07,960
Maybe that's how they're trying to control Seattle from getting too big.

2583
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:08,960
Go ahead.

2584
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:13,960
Well, to me, as someone who lived in the East Coast and the Midwest,

2585
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:17,960
I grew up in Michigan and also lived in Boston for a few years.

2586
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:22,960
There are comic conventions.

2587
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:27,960
There's conventions that add on video games,

2588
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:30,960
but it wasn't front and center.

2589
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:34,960
And everything else that really makes front and center for video games

2590
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,960
is all pretty much predominantly on the West Coast.

2591
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:39,960
So I'm really interested to see.

2592
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:44,960
I personally think that if nothing else comes down,

2593
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:47,960
a large big name on the East Coast,

2594
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:51,960
that PAX really has a very interesting opportunity here

2595
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:57,960
to be something, to really fulfill a demand

2596
02:15:57,960 --> 02:16:00,960
that hasn't been filled yet with East Coast

2597
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:02,960
because you've got all the people that wanted to go

2598
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:04,960
but couldn't make that big, huge stretch out there.

2599
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:06,960
Now it's a little bit more easier.

2600
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,960
It's like, oh, it's just a weekend instead of,

2601
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:13,960
or it's less than a day to get there versus a flight across the country.

2602
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:15,960
There's a lot of people in chat saying that there's not enough game companies

2603
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:17,960
on the East Coast, but I kind of disagree.

2604
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:20,960
Harmonix, 2K.

2605
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,960
And don't forget the folks in Toronto.

2606
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:23,960
It's not that far away for them.

2607
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:26,960
It's closer for them to go there than to go to Seattle.

2608
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,960
So I don't know. I beg to differ.

2609
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:30,960
I think they could get a decent show out of it.

2610
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:33,960
And there will be those folks that travel.

2611
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:34,960
Why not?

2612
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:38,960
The Warhammer people were just in Texas the week before.

2613
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:41,960
A lot of these folks travel to these different things.

2614
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:43,960
Well, I know there's people that definitely travel,

2615
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:50,960
but there's a lot of friends I have in both of those regions

2616
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:55,960
that definitely can't schedule out such a huge disruption

2617
02:16:55,960 --> 02:16:58,960
to take a lot of time off board because they have to fly across the country.

2618
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:03,960
But if it was right in their hometown or very close by,

2619
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:05,960
that's a lot of names there.

2620
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:07,960
And as far as not as many,

2621
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:12,960
the total amount of studios between the coast definitely leans towards the West Coast.

2622
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:16,960
But there's still a lot of big-name studios that had to fly everything else over.

2623
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:19,960
And not every West Coast studio went to PAX either.

2624
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:22,960
I made fun of Capcom earlier, and Konami was another big name that wasn't there.

2625
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:24,960
Not everybody's going to PAX yet.

2626
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:25,960
Yeah, exactly.

2627
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:28,960
So I think that also works to their advantage, but they'll still get big names,

2628
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:33,960
but they're not going to be flooding the doors like, say, Comic-Con on vendors.

2629
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:36,960
It could be interesting. I wonder how many people would go to both.

2630
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:38,960
I'm crazy enough I would want to go to both.

2631
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:39,960
Me too.

2632
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:40,960
I love the East Coast and I wouldn't want to go visit.

2633
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:43,960
But I also have places to crash at. I have plenty of friends to crash at.

2634
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,960
Especially if the shows are different enough.

2635
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:48,960
If you do get those different exhibitors that show up on the East Coast versus the West Coast,

2636
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:51,960
I think it could be sustainable for two cons.

2637
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:54,960
And shit, if they're serious about doing the Europe con too,

2638
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:56,960
shit, people would probably go to that too.

2639
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:58,960
I mean, I don't know if we would because it's a lot harder.

2640
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:01,960
When you talk international flight, that's a big one.

2641
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:05,960
But I'm sure if they're doing Eurogamer Expo

2642
02:18:05,960 --> 02:18:07,960
and Leipzig is growing leaps and bounds,

2643
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:10,960
what they were saying, what, like 200,000 frickin' people at Leipzig or something?

2644
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:13,960
Hell, you know, my co-workers were at Leipzig.

2645
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:15,960
Yeesh. Yeesh.

2646
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:19,960
So, Bobby Black Wolf's in chat and says, I do eight hours from each.

2647
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:23,960
And a lot of folks in chat are saying, I would love to go to Paxi's

2648
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:24,960
and I know I would like to go too.

2649
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:27,960
And act deft, our poor listener in Mexico says,

2650
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:29,960
I would just like to have a Mexico con, please.

2651
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:31,960
Start one.

2652
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:32,960
You never know.

2653
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,960
Call it Mexican.

2654
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:36,960
Mexican? I like that.

2655
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:38,960
Yeah.

2656
02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:41,960
All right, Seg, we got a long call, but it's been a great call,

2657
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:42,960
but I got to wrap it up.

2658
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:45,960
Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we go to the next call?

2659
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:48,960
Well, you know, I have to self-promote.

2660
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,960
All cool and attractive people, and that includes you,

2661
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:55,960
must look into getting Strong Bad.

2662
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:57,960
Have to plug my own thing.

2663
02:18:57,960 --> 02:18:58,960
I didn't know if you wanted to talk about that,

2664
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:00,960
but yes, you worked on the Strong Bad game,

2665
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:02,960
so you're very excited about the release.

2666
02:19:02,960 --> 02:19:03,960
And I hear it's doing very well, right?

2667
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:05,960
What, third week in a row it's top of the charts on Wii?

2668
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:06,960
Third week on the top of the charts.

2669
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:08,960
All right, let's go for four.

2670
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:09,960
All right, take care.

2671
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:10,960
All right, take care, buddy.

2672
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:11,960
Yep.

2673
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:12,960
All right, bye-bye.

2674
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:15,960
All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

2675
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:16,960
our username on Skype.

2676
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:19,960
Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.

2677
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:22,960
I'd be so down with Pax Boston, wouldn't you?

2678
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:25,960
I would be down if someone would pay my way.

2679
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:27,960
If we can make it work, we never know.

2680
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:28,960
All right, let's get another phone call.

2681
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:29,960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2682
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:31,960
Who's this?

2683
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:32,960
Hey, it's the Rob D.

2684
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:33,960
Hey, Rob D.

2685
02:19:33,960 --> 02:19:34,960
Hello.

2686
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:36,960
What is on your mind, my friend?

2687
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:37,960
Not too much.

2688
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:38,960
I hope this connection actually works out pretty well

2689
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:42,960
because I'm on a new ISP, so this connection may drop.

2690
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:43,960
So far, so good.

2691
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:45,960
Just wanted to talk about Pax, really.

2692
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:48,960
Not too much.

2693
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:50,960
Well, what did you think of Pax, please?

2694
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:51,960
Walk us through it.

2695
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:52,960
Fair enough.

2696
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,960
I saw you guys there, which is excellent,

2697
02:19:53,960 --> 02:19:55,960
and actually I saw many all-gamers there.

2698
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:58,960
I think about 25 somewhere around there.

2699
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:00,960
It actually ended up being a very good all-games meetup,

2700
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:02,960
a very good OLR meetup.

2701
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:04,960
I had Kevin DDR from the OLR chat room

2702
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:06,960
and some other just really great people.

2703
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:08,960
I mean, I was really surprised that...

2704
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:09,960
Well, I shouldn't say that.

2705
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:10,960
I shouldn't say that I was surprised,

2706
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:13,960
but it was really great to see that everyone there

2707
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:14,960
was really just a cool person.

2708
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:19,960
No one misrepresented themselves online in any way.

2709
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:21,960
Everyone was just a lot of fun to be around.

2710
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:23,960
I know this is something we usually say in the past.

2711
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:25,960
I don't think all games really does this,

2712
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:27,960
but it was nice to see that everybody kind of adopted

2713
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:29,960
that creed of don't be a dick.

2714
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:31,960
Nobody was an asshole, which is a good thing.

2715
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:33,960
Well, that's because Wil Wheaton had a sign up

2716
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:35,960
that said don't be a dick.

2717
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:37,960
Except for me.

2718
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:38,960
I was an asshole.

2719
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:41,960
Rob was the biggest diva the whole time.

2720
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:43,960
I'm king of nice, damn it.

2721
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:44,960
No, but seriously, in all seriousness,

2722
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:46,960
everybody was cool.

2723
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:47,960
You know what I mean?

2724
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:49,960
Sometimes when you meet strangers from the internet,

2725
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:50,960
you get a few weirdos in there,

2726
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:52,960
but everybody was pretty cool.

2727
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:53,960
You know what I mean?

2728
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:54,960
Having dinner with you guys

2729
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:56,960
and actually being able to talk with you guys.

2730
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:59,960
I will admit that when we were actually broadcasting,

2731
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:02,960
just being surrounded by Bobby,

2732
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:05,960
you, Dark Sakura, and Loki,

2733
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:07,960
I was like, what am I doing here?

2734
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:08,960
I don't belong here.

2735
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:10,960
You were being awesome is what you were doing.

2736
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:11,960
It was great.

2737
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:13,960
Even when I was looking at some of the other people

2738
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:15,960
who I've listened to their shows,

2739
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:18,960
like Luke from Game Addict Hotline, Ninja Sister,

2740
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,960
some of the people that were there,

2741
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:22,960
just kind of hearing them,

2742
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:24,960
and I know people have said this about me too

2743
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:25,960
when they've met me,

2744
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:27,960
hearing them talk and hearing the radio voice

2745
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:29,960
as they're sitting right there in front of you

2746
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:30,960
is kind of strange.

2747
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:31,960
You know what I mean?

2748
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:34,960
I don't know if you felt that.

2749
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:36,960
It's weird because you're so used to hearing it in the iPod,

2750
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:38,960
you don't really see these people,

2751
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:39,960
myself included,

2752
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:42,960
but then to see it all unfold live at PAX

2753
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:43,960
was kind of weird.

2754
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:46,960
I think Decipher was one of the people that said that too.

2755
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:49,960
Man, it's kind of weird to actually see you guys

2756
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:51,960
while you're talking.

2757
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:53,960
Yeah, he definitely said that.

2758
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:56,960
He actually said that when he stepped up to the mic,

2759
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:57,960
he was shaking a little bit,

2760
02:21:57,960 --> 02:21:58,960
which I thought was kind of funny,

2761
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:00,960
although I shouldn't make fun of him too much.

2762
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:01,960
I mean, it's probably the first time

2763
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:03,960
he's ever done anything like that

2764
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:05,960
over the internet and broadcasting, that sort of thing.

2765
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:07,960
Yeah, you learn it's no big deal.

2766
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:09,960
Any schmo can get an internet show, right?

2767
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:10,960
It's true.

2768
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:11,960
All right.

2769
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:14,960
What about the actual games and sights and sounds of PAX?

2770
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:18,960
What kind of games did you play at PAX that you liked?

2771
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:20,960
Well, I played Mortal Kombat vs. DC,

2772
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:24,960
which surprised me because it was actually fun.

2773
02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:25,960
It's a Mortal Kombat game.

2774
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:26,960
It'll never be a competitive fighter.

2775
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:27,960
That's not what Mortal Kombat's for.

2776
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:31,960
Mortal Kombat's really just for the fatalities,

2777
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:33,960
all the fun party game stuff,

2778
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:36,960
watching someone break someone else's body over their back

2779
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:40,960
and seeing 18 tibias and fibulas fly,

2780
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:42,960
even though no human could possibly have

2781
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:44,960
that many bones in their body.

2782
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:48,960
They were all the same bone over and over.

2783
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,960
Exactly.

2784
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:52,960
But what else did I see?

2785
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:54,960
The TNA Impact game,

2786
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:56,960
which I am a little bit of a wrestling fan,

2787
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:58,960
so I had to play that.

2788
02:22:58,960 --> 02:22:59,960
It was sad.

2789
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:00,960
No one was playing that one.

2790
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:01,960
I actually went up there.

2791
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:02,960
One of the developers was there by himself

2792
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:03,960
playing his own game,

2793
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:06,960
which was kind of sad in a way.

2794
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,960
I went up there and played him,

2795
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:09,960
and it was a good time.

2796
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:11,960
You made his day, probably.

2797
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:13,960
Probably, although not as much as I made the day.

2798
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:15,960
I think it's Locks Quest, people,

2799
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:17,960
because one of them actually stood right by me

2800
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:19,960
and walked me through the game

2801
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:24,960
and explained the different steps of development.

2802
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:27,960
They have no idea who I am.

2803
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:29,960
They're hoping that I'm probably some gaming journalist,

2804
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:30,960
but I'm just a fan,

2805
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:31,960
and they're taking all this time to tell me

2806
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:33,960
because I'm probably the first person to go by there.

2807
02:23:33,960 --> 02:23:37,960
Tower Defense games are not exactly big things at PAX.

2808
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:38,960
Those poor guys.

2809
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:39,960
I've got to say, though,

2810
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:40,960
PAX does give a really good shot

2811
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:42,960
to the indie developers and stuff,

2812
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:44,960
especially with that PAX 10 thing.

2813
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:46,960
Those 10 indie games were right in the middle of the show floor.

2814
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:47,960
You can't miss them.

2815
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:49,960
That's probably how Jamie got caught

2816
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:51,960
with the sushi game and all that stuff.

2817
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:52,960
Those guys were great,

2818
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:54,960
but they were tucked away in the corner.

2819
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:57,960
They don't really have the Kensha Hall syndrome

2820
02:23:57,960 --> 02:23:58,960
that E3 has,

2821
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:00,960
where the weird stuff goes to Kensha Hall.

2822
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:01,960
You've got to go to the basement.

2823
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:03,960
You know what I mean?

2824
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:06,960
I never actually made my way over to the PAX 10,

2825
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:09,960
so I can't say whether that was actually good or not.

2826
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:11,960
From what I hear, it was okay, at the very least.

2827
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:13,960
I got so much swag from PAX.

2828
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:14,960
I got three different shirts.

2829
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:16,960
I got a bunch of Rockstar stickers.

2830
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:17,960
I got, what else did I get?

2831
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:20,960
I didn't actually manage to get one of those energy drink samples,

2832
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:22,960
which I don't know if you went by there.

2833
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:24,960
That energy drink booth that was kind of packed away in the corner.

2834
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:26,960
You thought they were giving away free cans of their drink,

2835
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:28,960
but it was really, I don't know,

2836
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:30,960
a hundred empty cans just sitting on the table.

2837
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:32,960
I know. I saw that one.

2838
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:34,960
They want you to sign up to win a case or something.

2839
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:35,960
Something like that.

2840
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:37,960
I did sign up, though, for the ECA,

2841
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:39,960
and they were giving out balls geek beer.

2842
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:41,960
Really? I didn't see that.

2843
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:42,960
Oh, it was so good.

2844
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:45,960
Root beer with caffeine.

2845
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:46,960
Ooh.

2846
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:48,960
That does sound good.

2847
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:49,960
What else did I see?

2848
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:51,960
I didn't manage to actually play any of the games that had a gigantic line,

2849
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,960
like Little Big Planet.

2850
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:54,960
I just kind of stayed away from those.

2851
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:55,960
Aw, you missed out.

2852
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:57,960
Little Big Planet was great.

2853
02:24:57,960 --> 02:24:59,960
Now, granted, you know, we were a little spoiled

2854
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:00,960
since we got to go in a little bit early.

2855
02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:01,960
You know, there wasn't a line for it.

2856
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:04,960
And we got to get walked through by the US producer.

2857
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:08,960
And, yeah, I was spoiled, but, man, so worth it.

2858
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:11,960
I'm all about Little Big Planet now.

2859
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:14,960
Yeah, I have expected the Sonic RPG to be horrible.

2860
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:15,960
I went by the Sega booth,

2861
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:17,960
which took me a little while to find at first

2862
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:21,960
until I realized that there was a gigantic Sega sign.

2863
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:25,960
Do you know we didn't even realize Sega was there until day two?

2864
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:27,960
I mean, they didn't exactly...

2865
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:29,960
Like, there weren't any Sega signs on the booth itself.

2866
02:25:29,960 --> 02:25:31,960
It was just the giant Sega sign hanging from the ceiling,

2867
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:33,960
and you wouldn't really notice that

2868
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:35,960
unless you were a really far distance away.

2869
02:25:35,960 --> 02:25:38,960
And by that point, you may have gotten distracted by tons of other booths.

2870
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:40,960
You know, you're going toward the Sega booth,

2871
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:42,960
and they're like, ooh, Afro Samurai, I should play that,

2872
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:43,960
which is also great.

2873
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:45,960
That game was hot.

2874
02:25:45,960 --> 02:25:49,960
I love the Little Red Riding Hood killing the zombies game.

2875
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:50,960
That was hot, too.

2876
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:51,960
That was funny.

2877
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:53,960
All right, Rob D., we got to wrap it up here

2878
02:25:53,960 --> 02:25:54,960
because we can probably get one more call,

2879
02:25:54,960 --> 02:25:59,960
but quickly, best thing about PAX and worst thing about PAX?

2880
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:02,960
Best thing about PAX, the people, without question.

2881
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:04,960
I like the con, I like the exhibitors hall,

2882
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:06,960
but, you know, actually being able to see everyone

2883
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:08,960
and talk with the people that I've been chatting with

2884
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,960
over the last few years was just,

2885
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:12,960
really just made for an unparalleled experience at any con I've been to.

2886
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:14,960
Aw, I'm getting a little choked up here.

2887
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:15,960
The amount of people.

2888
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:17,960
The amount of people, by far.

2889
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:19,960
I couldn't actually make it into any panel without waiting,

2890
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:21,960
like, at least an hour in line,

2891
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:24,960
and by the time I saw how long the lines were,

2892
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:27,960
I just, I didn't even try.

2893
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:30,960
Yeah, something was going to have to be done about that for next year.

2894
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:33,960
I don't know what, but they'll think of something fair.

2895
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:34,960
We'll see.

2896
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:36,960
Maybe they'll get to organize it,

2897
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:37,960
they'll figure out how to organize it better.

2898
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:39,960
I mean, the fact is that they've only had five years,

2899
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,960
which isn't really a long amount of time for any con,

2900
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:43,960
especially when they've been in the Seattle Convention Center for,

2901
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:44,960
I think, two years.

2902
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:45,960
True, very true.

2903
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:47,960
And there's a whole sixth floor,

2904
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:49,960
I bet they're going to have to open it next year, we'll see.

2905
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:50,960
Because what was going on?

2906
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:51,960
Thanks for taking my call.

2907
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:53,960
Gender odyssey was going on at the same time we were there?

2908
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:54,960
I think so.

2909
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:56,960
Yeah, they kind of kept that on the down low,

2910
02:26:56,960 --> 02:27:01,960
which is probably a good idea with how immature gamers can be on occasion.

2911
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:03,960
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't have cared, you know,

2912
02:27:03,960 --> 02:27:05,960
heck, with all the years I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show,

2913
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:06,960
I've seen everything.

2914
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:11,960
But, you know, I think it's kind of interesting how segregated they kept the two.

2915
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:12,960
Very interesting.

2916
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:14,960
All right, Rob D., thanks for the call.

2917
02:27:14,960 --> 02:27:15,960
Take care, buddy.

2918
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:16,960
And good to meet you.

2919
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:17,960
Yep, you too.

2920
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:18,960
We'll see you next year, right?

2921
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:19,960
Hopefully.

2922
02:27:19,960 --> 02:27:20,960
All right.

2923
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:21,960
Work on it.

2924
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:22,960
Save your pennies now.

2925
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:23,960
All right, see you.

2926
02:27:23,960 --> 02:27:25,960
That's all I'm going to have to do is start saving now.

2927
02:27:25,960 --> 02:27:28,960
I think we can fit in one more call.

2928
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:31,960
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2929
02:27:31,960 --> 02:27:35,960
I think after one more call we should be good here.

2930
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:37,960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2931
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:38,960
Who's this?

2932
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:39,960
Hello, guy.

2933
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:42,960
And, like, it's Blade 3.

2934
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:43,960
Blade 3?

2935
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:45,960
What is on your mind, Blade 3?

2936
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:46,960
Not much.

2937
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:47,960
It's kind of late where I am.

2938
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:48,960
Where are you?

2939
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:49,960
Are you on the East Coast?

2940
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:51,960
Yeah, it's 12.

2941
02:27:51,960 --> 02:27:52,960
All right.

2942
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:54,960
It's way past everyone's bedtime over there.

2943
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:55,960
But that's all right.

2944
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:56,960
We're trying to wrap up the show.

2945
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:57,960
See how I can go to bed.

2946
02:27:57,960 --> 02:27:58,960
What's on your mind?

2947
02:27:58,960 --> 02:27:59,960
What did you call in about tonight?

2948
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:03,960
Well, I just wanted to tell Rocky, because I'm sure he's still listening,

2949
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:08,960
that I figured out my own coding for my website.

2950
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:12,960
Oh, you sent us an email wanting Loki's source code.

2951
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:13,960
All right.

2952
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:16,960
Well, I'm sorry to hear he isn't going to give it up,

2953
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:17,960
but I understand at the same time.

2954
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:19,960
He still wants to make improvements to it and everything,

2955
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:23,960
and there's still probably a lot he wants to do with it.

2956
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:24,960
But that's good.

2957
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:27,960
You know, hey, nothing like being inspired by something else

2958
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:28,960
to make your own thing.

2959
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:31,960
In fact, I think that's kind of how Loki made that listener site,

2960
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:33,960
is that I think he saw some other stuff

2961
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:36,960
and kind of tried to make it even better.

2962
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:39,960
So that's how it was born.

2963
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:46,960
Yeah, so I made my own, and you can check it out at mmtsp.tk.

2964
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:47,960
Nice.

2965
02:28:47,960 --> 02:28:48,960
I love that he's working in a plug.

2966
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:51,960
What will I find on this wonderful PSP site?

2967
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:56,960
Right now it's in a shimmy data.

2968
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:58,960
Basically there's just one page,

2969
02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:02,960
and it just has links to other pages with nothing on them so far.

2970
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:03,960
All right.

2971
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:05,960
Well, you got to start somewhere.

2972
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:11,960
By the end of the week, I should have quite a few demos and DVDs,

2973
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:14,960
some funny videos, and some soundtracks from games.

2974
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:15,960
All right.

2975
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:17,960
All right, young entrepreneur,

2976
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:19,960
we wish you the best of luck with your site.

2977
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:22,960
Anything else you want to talk about tonight?

2978
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:23,960
One more thing.

2979
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:25,960
Yes.

2980
02:29:25,960 --> 02:29:28,960
I'm making a PSP site as an add-on to my regular site,

2981
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:34,960
and my regular site is masterman.tk.

2982
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:36,960
Plug, plug, plug, plug.

2983
02:29:36,960 --> 02:29:38,960
You know, we're going to start charging 50 bucks a plug,

2984
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:39,960
just so you know.

2985
02:29:39,960 --> 02:29:41,960
All right, best of luck with your sites, buddy.

2986
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:42,960
All right.

2987
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:43,960
Have fun.

2988
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:44,960
All right.

2989
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:46,960
So all of our listeners need to go visit these sites,

2990
02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:48,960
and if they're terrible, I want you to tear this guy apart.

2991
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:49,960
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2992
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:50,960
You got to start somewhere.

2993
02:29:50,960 --> 02:29:53,960
We're all about supporting the independents and new ideas.

2994
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:55,960
And, you know, PSP sites aren't really getting enough love.

2995
02:29:55,960 --> 02:29:57,960
I mean, sure, there's a few sites out there,

2996
02:29:57,960 --> 02:29:59,960
but, man, that's a whole universe.

2997
02:29:59,960 --> 02:30:01,960
It's not really being explored as well as it could be.

2998
02:30:01,960 --> 02:30:03,960
So, someday.

2999
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:05,960
All right, well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

3000
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:06,960
Sorry for those that didn't get through,

3001
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:07,960
but you can always send us an email,

3002
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:08,960
mailbagorangelaundry.com.

3003
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:10,960
Give Jamie some work to do next week.

3004
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:12,960
Make her read more emails, right, Jamie?

3005
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:13,960
No.

3006
02:30:13,960 --> 02:30:14,960
I actually have stories.

3007
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:15,960
Oh, you have a last-minute story or two?

3008
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:16,960
Things popped up.

3009
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:17,960
Go for it.

3010
02:30:17,960 --> 02:30:19,960
Just in case no one knew,

3011
02:30:19,960 --> 02:30:22,960
Microsoft actually did lower the download content prices.

3012
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:25,960
I have the list of what they lowered.

3013
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:26,960
Cool.

3014
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:27,960
Have we mentioned this before?

3015
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:28,960
I don't think so.

3016
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:32,960
I think it was a sale that was only for this weekend.

3017
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:33,960
I believe so.

3018
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:34,960
Could be wrong.

3019
02:30:34,960 --> 02:30:35,960
I don't remember.

3020
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:39,960
But Mass Effect went down to 300 points of Bring Down the Sky.

3021
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:42,960
Lost Odyssey Triple Bonus Pack went to 120.

3022
02:30:42,960 --> 02:30:45,960
Forza Motorsport 2, the Motegi Track Pack,

3023
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:51,960
and the September, December, March car packs went down to 240 each.

3024
02:30:51,960 --> 02:30:55,960
Oblivion Elder Scrolls IV Shivering Isles went to 1600.

3025
02:30:55,960 --> 02:30:57,960
Guitar Hero 3, Def Leppard, Foo Fighters,

3026
02:30:57,960 --> 02:31:00,960
Classic Rock Track Packs to 360.

3027
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:04,960
Beautiful Katamari, the Accessory ABCD set went to 120.

3028
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:06,960
Special Accessory as well.

3029
02:31:06,960 --> 02:31:08,960
Just Size stage went to 120.

3030
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:13,960
And the Big 10, 11 stages went to 140.

3031
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:16,960
So that's it.

3032
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:17,960
All right.

3033
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:18,960
I like sales.

3034
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:19,960
I like cheap things.

3035
02:31:19,960 --> 02:31:21,960
All right.

3036
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:22,960
I do have a last minute story real quick.

3037
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:24,960
It has to do with the Max Payne movie.

3038
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:25,960
Tiger Claw sent me this one.

3039
02:31:25,960 --> 02:31:27,960
I remember reading about this earlier in the week.

3040
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:28,960
It didn't make our show roll, though.

3041
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:32,960
But apparently the Max Payne movie has been rated R and not happy.

3042
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:34,960
John Moore, the director of the movie, is pissed.

3043
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:37,960
It was supposed to be a PG-13 movie.

3044
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:39,960
I'm hoping he's lobbying the MPAA.

3045
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:41,960
What a bunch of fuck wads.

3046
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:43,960
I mean, really, have you heard about some of the shit they pull?

3047
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:46,960
I just, I hate the MPAA.

3048
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:47,960
I really do.

3049
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:52,960
You know, the fact that they, God, that movies can be so freaking violent and crazy and,

3050
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:56,960
you know, they get an R, but heaven forbid you show a wiener or some titties and, you

3051
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:58,960
know, you risk getting an NC-17.

3052
02:31:58,960 --> 02:32:01,960
It's just horrible what they've done.

3053
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:07,960
Anyhow, the MPAA has slapped an R on this movie, which means it's not going to be able to be

3054
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:10,960
seen by teenagers, which who knows, maybe it really is for the best.

3055
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:12,960
Maybe we have blurred the lines too much with what is safe.

3056
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:14,960
Max Payne, I would definitely put an R on that.

3057
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:19,960
Well, apparently, though, he actually, he did try to dumb it down a little bit.

3058
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:22,960
Like, he actually kind of cut out some of the language.

3059
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:24,960
No heads are cut off.

3060
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,960
No eyeballs are ripped out or any of that stuff.

3061
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:30,960
He actually did tame it down a bit to try and get the PG-13 and still got the R.

3062
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:35,960
So he was kind of, kind of miffed about that, as you can understand.

3063
02:32:35,960 --> 02:32:36,960
But here's the thing.

3064
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:42,960
He actually goes, so far as to say, they gave The Dark Knight a PG-13 rating and basically

3065
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:44,960
sucked Warner Brothers' cock.

3066
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:46,960
His words, not mine.

3067
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:48,960
But you know, yeah, it's something to think about.

3068
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:51,960
You know, The Dark Knight was a pretty dark film too.

3069
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:57,960
I think it just goes to show the MPAA is fucked.

3070
02:32:57,960 --> 02:32:59,960
So fire them all, that's what I say.

3071
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:01,960
And then, yeah, that's another thing I've been thinking about.

3072
02:33:01,960 --> 02:33:04,960
And Quel Tipo brings us up, that Zack and Miri make a porno.

3073
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:05,960
I don't know if you've heard about this.

3074
02:33:05,960 --> 02:33:10,960
The Kevin Smith movie was originally rated NC-17 because, oh my God, porno.

3075
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:12,960
They were able to talk it down to an R somehow.

3076
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:17,960
But then they ended up banning the first poster for the movie because it implied that there

3077
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:19,960
was oral sex.

3078
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:21,960
Get over it.

3079
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:22,960
I don't know.

3080
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:25,960
It's just a little stupid.

3081
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:28,960
Quel Tipo does say though, and I think this is interesting, I'd be more willing to see

3082
02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:32,960
an R-rated Max Payne than a PG-13 version.

3083
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:33,960
Tigerclaw says, here's the thing.

3084
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:38,960
The first Mortal Kombat movie was PG-13 even though it was based on an M-rated game.

3085
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:41,960
The movie wins you back because of all the kick-ass fight sequences.

3086
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:43,960
Hmm, something to think about.

3087
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:45,960
So lots of good points made by everybody.

3088
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:48,960
All right, well, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3089
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:50,960
Hey, thanks, you guys, for sticking with us tonight.

3090
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:54,960
And myself and Dark Soccer are holding down the fort.

3091
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:58,960
It was very lovely having you all in chat tonight to help fill in as our third host tonight.

3092
02:33:58,960 --> 02:34:00,960
We always love having you guys on the program.

3093
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:02,960
Thank you, guys.

3094
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:06,960
And so we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.

3095
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:09,960
Final thoughts, Dark Soccer, your final thought?

3096
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:11,960
Poop.

3097
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:12,960
Lovely.

3098
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:16,960
My final thought is fart.

3099
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:19,960
Hey, no, no, you said fart, so I have to say dick.

3100
02:34:19,960 --> 02:34:21,960
All right.

3101
02:34:21,960 --> 02:34:23,960
We have some other final thoughts from chat.

3102
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:26,960
Shaq-Fu, that's a good final thought.

3103
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:28,960
Your Shaq-Fu moment of the day.

3104
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:29,960
All right, that's going to do it.

3105
02:34:29,960 --> 02:34:32,960
Hey, guys, thank you so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting

3106
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:35,960
like Orange Lounge Radio where dick and fart jokes are still okay.

3107
02:34:35,960 --> 02:34:37,960
We haven't sold out yet.

3108
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:39,960
What about boob and burp jokes?

3109
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:41,960
Boob and burp jokes are always welcome.

3110
02:34:41,960 --> 02:34:45,960
Thank you, guys, so much for supporting us and leaving us the nice things you have been on iTunes lately.

3111
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:47,960
There's been a couple people that added reviews.

3112
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:49,960
Thank you, guys, so much for your kind reviews.

3113
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:51,960
We'd always appreciate a few more five-star reviews.

3114
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:55,960
It really helps out our ranking and, therefore, as we get bumped up in the rankings, we're more visible.

3115
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:58,960
Even if you can't do that, just tell a couple friends about the show.

3116
02:34:58,960 --> 02:34:59,960
That's all we ask.

3117
02:34:59,960 --> 02:35:01,960
That's our super powers, extra visibility.

3118
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:02,960
You got it.

3119
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:03,960
Word of mouth.

3120
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:04,960
And how.

3121
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:05,960
We have no magazine.

3122
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:07,960
We have no corporate-funded website.

3123
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:09,960
We don't sell ads.

3124
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:12,960
It's all about the word of mouth, so we appreciate it.

3125
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:14,960
But I do sell my virtual body on the internet.

3126
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:15,960
Just kidding.

3127
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:21,960
Until next time and until the next Penny Arcade Expo to see some of you guys again in person,

3128
02:35:21,960 --> 02:35:22,960
although hopefully not.

3129
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:23,960
We'll see some of you guys around.

3130
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:29,960
There's certainly talk of ASEN for next year and definitely E for All for me, so we'll be seeing you guys later.

3131
02:35:29,960 --> 02:35:33,960
But until next week, when Loki will be back, this is Rob Roberts.

3132
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:34,960
She's Dark Sakura.

3133
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:36,960
He's at home listening, Loki.

3134
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:37,960
We'll all be back next week.

3135
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:38,960
We are together.

3136
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:40,960
Orange Lounge Radio.

3137
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:45,960
