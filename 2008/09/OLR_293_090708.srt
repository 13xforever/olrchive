1
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:25,207
[SPEAKER_09]: We take some time to decompress after Penny Arcade Expo, Luminous makes its way to yet another platform, and could a new Kingdom Hearts game be showing at Tokyo Game Show?

2
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:32,267
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

3
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:52,942
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

4
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,517
[SPEAKER_05]: She's replaced him with Rob's laundry Yes

5
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:23,932
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just kidding, of course.

6
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:28,394
[SPEAKER_03]: He's away at a thing for his day job today that he had to go to, so he won't be here tonight.

7
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,556
[SPEAKER_03]: But he'll be back next week, as we all will.

8
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have no guests tonight either.

9
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:41,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the lovely DarkSakura, myself, feeling the love with all you kids from our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

10
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have some stuff there in chat.

11
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:47,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Gsquared68 says, Orange Laundry Mower Radio.

12
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:49,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to get Dan to come tonight.

13
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:49,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

14
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:51,288
[SPEAKER_05]: What was his excuse?

15
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:52,029
[SPEAKER_05]: He had to work.

16
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:53,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, bummer.

17
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid job!

18
00:01:55,554 --> 00:02:00,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't you telling me that Dan, gosh, he so, so just worked and worn out.

19
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:02,658
[SPEAKER_03]: He was playing Street Fighter IV this week or something?

20
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:06,240
[SPEAKER_05]: It was at the Game Crazy Manager Conference.

21
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,384
[SPEAKER_05]: They either had it there or he went to an arcade that had one, but he played Street Fighter IV and said that it was pretty good, but the jumping was weird.

22
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:14,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

23
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:16,597
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks very slick from what I've seen.

24
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:18,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to getting my hands on it.

25
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

26
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:20,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Very excited.

27
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:22,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that's not the one I'm excited about.

28
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:22,988
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you excited about?

29
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:27,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Freakin' Capcom vs. Tatsunoko I had a feeling Any particular reason?

30
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:27,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Gatchaman!

31
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:47,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, Gatchaman And Dan was like, it doesn't have Joe in it I was like, but it has Ken, and it has Hurricane Polymer And Kashan, so it's all cool Alright, very nice And Techamon Gsquared68 is also mentioning in our chatroom San Jose State has it, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump from us So maybe we have to take a road trip at some point

32
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:48,748
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool.

33
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:49,208
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

34
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:52,430
[SPEAKER_03]: A little OLR road trip as if Seattle wasn't fun enough.

35
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Seattle, Penny Arcade Expo.

36
00:02:56,573 --> 00:03:04,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we did not get to do our own show just due to some technical difficulties, but we contributed to... Shut up.

37
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,298
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

38
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:08,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Due to... I'm going to come clean on this one.

39
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Due to when we were going to be doing a show, Jamie instead passed out.

40
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:16,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I had technical difficulties with my ability to stay awake.

41
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:17,127
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, Rob?

42
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:17,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

43
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:39,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fantastic.

44
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:41,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And some Bobby bonding as well.

45
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:42,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And some hatred of the Western Internet.

46
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Western Internet was sucky.

47
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:47,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And some bonding with our listeners.

48
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,956
[SPEAKER_03]: We had just a wonderful turnout.

49
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:53,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Such an experience with that superglue and duct tape, I swear.

50
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:57,584
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackWolf is clarifying in chat there was no bondage

51
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:26,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where that came from.

52
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:27,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of our chatters are going there.

53
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:28,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said bonding.

54
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:29,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I meant literally, you know.

55
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:30,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonding.

56
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:31,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It was that episode.

57
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:32,696
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

58
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:33,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

59
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:35,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so how was your Penny Arcade Expo, DarkSakura?

60
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we usually start with how was your gaming week, but seeing as Penny Arcade Expo was such a... We'll get to gaming week post-packs later.

61
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:42,928
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your Penny Arcade Expo?

62
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,750
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of stuff did you see at the show that you enjoyed?

63
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Walk us through your time at Penny Arcade Expo a little bit.

64
00:04:46,992 --> 00:05:01,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was in a daze, you know, that Friday, because I was just all like, pretty, shiny, Namco, hang out with Namco for an hour, you know, and they were just selling stuff, but I was like, dude, I don't care, because it's Namco, and I wanted a Dig Dug plushie and couldn't get one.

65
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:02,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you miss the memo that Namco hates us?

66
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Katamari, remember that?

67
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:05,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, forget it.

68
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So... I'm kidding.

69
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Namco!

70
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really like LittleBigPlanet.

71
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was pretty cool.

72
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:45,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked what I saw of Spore.

73
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:47,752
[SPEAKER_05]: We're probably gonna get it eventually.

74
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:52,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have much time to play it, so it's whenever Dan gets it.

75
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:54,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually liked Wii Music.

76
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,538
[SPEAKER_05]: because I thought that it was just neat.

77
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:10,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that, you know, and I like... I'm one of those people who likes finding, you know, MIDI programs and then redoing all the instruments in the MIDI to sound completely bizarre.

78
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:20,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's actually one of the things that I liked about Wii Music is that it just had that playing with MIDI tones type of thing to it.

79
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:23,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal Crossing, it was...

80
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal Crossing, and I really liked the Wario game.

81
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:30,435
[SPEAKER_05]: That one was kind of cool.

82
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:37,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went over to hang out with, okay, was it EA?

83
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:38,064
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't EA.

84
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,806
[SPEAKER_05]: EA had some of the crap.

85
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:42,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know, Bobby just disowned you because you like Wii music.

86
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say that I was going to play it.

87
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:46,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought it was neat.

88
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:52,417
[SPEAKER_05]: This comes from my old, what was my third major?

89
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:53,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Music major, right?

90
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:56,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on major number 12 now.

91
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be all over Wii Music if I was 12.

92
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I thought it was neat.

93
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be something that would be fun to waste some time with, I thought.

94
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:06,184
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate.

95
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:06,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say this.

96
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:14,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Wolf just said, I liked and Wii Music do not belong in the same sentence, unless in the context of, I liked to hate on Wii Music.

97
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:18,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we said this in an earlier show when we first talked about Wii Music.

98
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,327
[SPEAKER_03]: If it gets kids into real music, it's a good thing, regardless.

99
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:24,267
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I think.

100
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:28,788
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great platform into learning a bit more.

101
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:31,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Because really, it teaches tempo.

102
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,790
[SPEAKER_05]: It teaches a little bit of arrangement.

103
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it's a neat little concept.

104
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have totally loved to have something like this when I was little.

105
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:41,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Mario Paint.

106
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:43,432
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

107
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:44,942
[SPEAKER_05]: MarioPaint

108
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:04,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Sushi Bumper Sumo Fun Game

109
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:36,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I was saying earlier when Bobby called in, you play as a sushi plate and you have to keep the other piece of sushi away from the others.

110
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:40,203
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can knock you into the conveyor belt and you lose a piece of sushi.

111
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:46,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And whoever holds on to the sushi for the longest time within two minutes gets a higher score and wins.

112
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:47,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, keep away with sushi.

113
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:48,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

114
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,930
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a really fun, weird little game.

115
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I understand, it's supposed to be coming out on an Xbox Live Arcade, so I'm looking forward to that.

116
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:08,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really wish I had earplugs for all the people who couldn't sing that were playing Rock Band and Guitar Hero.

117
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:12,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I mean, you've got a bar telling you when you're out of tune, you should actually pay attention to it.

118
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:26,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I don't know if I've said so before on the show, but I hear perfect pitch, which drove me nuts in band, but I really can't filter out.

119
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I don't like to sing in front of people because I can hear it in myself.

120
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:30,871
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I don't sing.

121
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:40,274
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, other stuff that I saw that was really cool was Pink Godzilla because I bought stuff from Pink Godzilla.

122
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:44,495
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who doesn't know, my anniversary was on the 1st.

123
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:49,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and I have been married for three years and I bought him his anniversary present from Pink Godzilla.

124
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:53,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I got him a salamander pack for PSP.

125
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:55,359
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nerd love right there.

126
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,080
[SPEAKER_05]: That is nerd love.

127
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he got me an iPod that he got for free.

128
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:02,887
[SPEAKER_03]: He re-gifted for your anniversary?

129
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:03,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

130
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:04,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

131
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:05,590
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it's an iPod.

132
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:10,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's little in red and it says the GameStop Special Edition or some shit on it.

133
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:13,959
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, other fun stuff.

134
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:19,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked hanging out with the Commander 3 people.

135
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:19,987
[SPEAKER_05]: They were kind of cool.

136
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, they were really cool.

137
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:24,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually went to talk to some of the digital design students.

138
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:28,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Dork.

139
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:33,139
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do this in Wii Music, but you can do it in Mario Paint.

140
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,682
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually a pretty decent little arrangement.

141
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:43,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's my bucket so I can roll it at you?

142
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, couldn't resist.

143
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:46,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

144
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:48,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Music will never have the greatness of the Mario Paint.

145
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:50,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Paint was fantastic.

146
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:52,229
[SPEAKER_05]: We need Mario Paint the sequel.

147
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:55,450
[SPEAKER_05]: We need Mario Paint 2 Electric Boogaloo.

148
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:07,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Other stuff that I saw slash played or did, yeah, I was mentioning, I was talking to a lot of the digital design schools that try to get people to sign up for their schools.

149
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:15,110
[SPEAKER_05]: They really actually got a lot of good tips for myself as far as things to study in my current major.

150
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:22,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they were all like, we'd prefer you to go to our school, but there's a few of them that were actually beginning transfer programs I was kind of looking into.

151
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:27,859
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one in Sunnyvale, and that would just be really cool because then I'd be close to Capcom's testing grounds, and that would be sweet.

152
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:54,923
[SPEAKER_05]: um also um trying out all the fun restaurants going to Gameworks which was oddly disappointing because I couldn't win that Tales out of the Crane game and there was an incredible incredible lack of Planet Harriers so I wanted to cry and sob tears of you know of disappointment for having no Planet Harrier because Planet Harrier is one of the greatest arcade games ever ever are

153
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:57,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what?

154
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's looking like he's up to something, everybody.

155
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,947
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they just wanted to link to the YouTube and chat.

156
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:08,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just put it in there in true Mario Paint Roll fashion.

157
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:11,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I put, dude, this YouTube is so cool, and then put the link.

158
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see how many people click.

159
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Dork.

160
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I also played, actually I was very surprised about how much I liked it.

161
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:29,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the Ninja Gaiden demo on DS, and it was really, really cool, but there was another DS demo that actually was really freaking fun, and that was the Arkanoid demo.

162
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:38,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to play Arkanoid back in the day on the old, you know, Game Brick, the old Game Boy, and that was pretty fun.

163
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:43,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw people playing a WonderSwan, and I wished I had brought my WonderSwan.

164
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:46,871
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

165
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,962
[SPEAKER_05]: TurboGrafx Duo Laptop

166
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:32,573
[SPEAKER_05]: which had its own little screen and everything.

167
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:34,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Really freaking expensive.

168
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:36,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I saw someone who had one.

169
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:40,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got to meet my musical hero, Jonathan Coulton.

170
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:43,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to meet my geek hero, Wil Wheaton.

171
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:45,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

172
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:12,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just really fun.

173
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:16,504
[SPEAKER_05]: There were the free game panels, there were movies, there were performances.

174
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:18,025
[SPEAKER_05]: This wasn't like E3.

175
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,385
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a freaking convention.

176
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:20,446
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what this was.

177
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:26,368
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 is a media spectacle, I should say.

178
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:35,032
[SPEAKER_05]: PAX is like an anime con, but just video games.

179
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:42,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to say to all of you folks that went to Penny Arcade Expo, I'm quite proud of the majority of you for knowing how to bathe properly.

180
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:43,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I know!

181
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:55,016
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually a pretty pleasant smelling, I mean, don't get me wrong, there were a few people that smelled like fart, but some people, the most people It's the gym sock syndrome, you can tell who's been sleeping in the lounge.

182
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:57,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people were very well bathed, and I appreciate it.

183
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:02,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the all games people were well, well bathed, so thank you all.

184
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:05,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, I just really had a good time.

185
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:07,149
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, it felt a lot... Except for DMN.

186
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:08,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirty bastard.

187
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:10,410
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt a lot like going to Faname.

188
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the impression that you got?

189
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:17,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Kinda, but it was all games, so I felt like I understood it.

190
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like it was... As opposed to Faname.

191
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:25,816
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, I thought that it was very well organized as far as getting into some of the events, even though I didn't go to the one event I wanted to go to.

192
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:28,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that and the Nerdcore Rising.

193
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to see MC Frontalot, but I didn't buy anything from him.

194
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:31,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well.

195
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:37,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, but it was just really, I thought, well-organized in how they had everything together.

196
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:40,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And it gave everybody a fair opportunity.

197
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:44,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was even what impressed me a whole lot more.

198
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:45,515
[SPEAKER_05]: That and there was some cosplay.

199
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:46,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

200
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very convention-like.

201
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:49,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Except there was some really shitty cosplay.

202
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:52,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And whoever that was who cosplayed the bride who wasn't wearing underwear...

203
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:55,279
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to eat a steak, girl.

204
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

205
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:09,531
[SPEAKER_05]: When you can see someone's pelvic bones, their hips, no, that's a sign that somebody needs to freaking sit down with a porterhouse and chow down.

206
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:12,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, and nobody wants to see your ass.

207
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:12,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

208
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:17,163
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

209
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:32,480
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

210
00:16:48,513 --> 00:17:16,505
[SPEAKER_03]: has the potential to be neat or really really stale and right now it's feeling a little stale so I just really hope the internet functionality is built in there the way we're all dreaming of because that's going to be what saves this game the Wario Land game was great too but you know obviously that's something we've kind of already seen here in studio if you've been paying attention in the last few episodes as far as other stuff that Jamie didn't talk about because I don't think it's quite up her alley Warhammer Online I got to check out a little bit they had a booth set up there and

211
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:17,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot my name

212
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:42,032
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, which isn't a bad thing.

213
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,293
[SPEAKER_03]: WoW is a great formula.

214
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:48,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it has slightly nicer graphics and it, you know, kind of tracks your quests a little differently.

215
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,976
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, naturally, you have different classes, different races.

216
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not the exact same as WoW.

217
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:55,778
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just would have liked to have seen a little more on the floor.

218
00:17:55,818 --> 00:18:00,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand they showed some of this in panels, but, you know, those were impossible to get into without waiting forever.

219
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:01,862
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

220
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:22,203
[SPEAKER_03]: LittleBigPlanet, loved it, loved it.

221
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:23,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Game of the show for me, honestly.

222
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:28,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very surprised at just really how good Sony's booth was, all things considered.

223
00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:34,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually thought the games Sony was showing was probably better than the stuff Nintendo was showing on a whole.

224
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Sinkstar looked fun, I didn't get a chance to play it though

225
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:01,269
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

226
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Katana, she played Catwoman.

227
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:18,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that's right, we did play that.

228
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:18,886
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun!

229
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:20,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of fun.

230
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:23,531
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I said this when I was kind of trying to summarize the show in my live journal.

231
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:26,814
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never going to be as great as Marvel vs. Capcom.

232
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:36,744
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and Mortal Kombat has always been a little bit of a, I don't know, not so serious, at least to me, especially like in any Mortal Kombat game since like 2.0.

233
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:43,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like a real hardcore fighting game.

234
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:48,168
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of a game that seems to not take itself so seriously, at least in my mind.

235
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:49,068
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

236
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:52,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the trend continues here with DC Universe.

237
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,271
[SPEAKER_03]: You really are just kind of taking out Mortal Kombat characters and putting in DC Universe characters instead, but it's the same engine.

238
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:04,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's a game anyone's going to remember years from now or lavish praise on, but was it a lot of big dumb fun?

239
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:04,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

240
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:04,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

241
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:06,375
[SPEAKER_03]: D&D 4th Edition D&D 4th Edition D&D 4th Edition

242
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:46,746
[SPEAKER_03]: and then let's see there's another game at PAX Puzzle Quest Galactrix I'll say really quickly I got to play a little bit of they had that playable on the show floor and you just have to really think it's not like Bejeweled anymore I mean it is but now it's on a hexagon which completely changes the way you have to think about the game but I enjoy myself with that game I just hope it's not too I mean that well I'm kind of thinking you know I hope it's not too much of the same

243
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:51,850
[SPEAKER_03]: But they really did try to mix it up with putting it on the hexagon and kind of giving it the space theme.

244
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be kind of cool.

245
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:59,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very disappointed, though, that they were showing a trailer for Star Trek Online on the floor, but not any actual gameplay.

246
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:00,237
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't make me disappointed.

247
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:02,559
[SPEAKER_05]: That made my heart hurt because I'm totally going to play that.

248
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.

249
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping to see a little more on that.

250
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:05,022
[SPEAKER_03]: But I understand.

251
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:05,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's early.

252
00:21:05,502 --> 00:21:05,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It's early.

253
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:06,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not hating.

254
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:10,887
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, it got my hopes up only to be crushed by disappointment.

255
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:13,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And one more game I'll mention.

256
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:15,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Iron Chef America is crap

257
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:42,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be a lot of big dumb fun.

258
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:43,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I did like how you could garnish your plate.

259
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:44,439
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of fun.

260
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:45,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

261
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:48,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess part of it is presentation.

262
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

263
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:52,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was cool.

264
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:54,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at comments from chat.

265
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:57,362
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD says, Iron Mama, in a way.

266
00:21:58,202 --> 00:21:58,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

267
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:00,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at other comments from chat here.

268
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:04,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to add some things to the chat.

269
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:09,528
[SPEAKER_03]: and I can't say this name, K-H-A-S-N, Kassen.

270
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:10,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's how you say it.

271
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,210
[SPEAKER_03]: The game looks bad.

272
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:19,054
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphics aren't stellar, but it is on the Wii, which doesn't really do the high def stuff so well.

273
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:23,397
[SPEAKER_05]: A game is only... Play it first.

274
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:26,539
[SPEAKER_03]: A game with crappy graphics can still be fun.

275
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the old Atari 2600 games.

276
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's E.T.

277
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:35,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's not going to be anything you're going to remember for a lifetime, but for $20, it's a good waste of time.

278
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:38,347
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I guess that's all I really want to say about PAX.

279
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:40,628
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

280
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:45,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk some more about the whole PAX broadcast and all that in just a little bit when we get to housekeeping.

281
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to say, though, how was your gaming week after PAX?

282
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you play anything post-PAX that you want to talk about?

283
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:50,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Ragnarok.

284
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:54,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played a stellar game of Black Knight 2000 Pinball.

285
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:57,819
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, we are selling our Black Knight 2000 Pinball.

286
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, are you disappointed about that, or is it time?

287
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:01,002
[SPEAKER_05]: We want one with a better playfield.

288
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:01,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

289
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:04,744
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also selling our Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball.

290
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:07,966
[SPEAKER_05]: because, again, we want a better table.

291
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:08,827
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

292
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:11,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as long as you're going to get it back because I love Next Generation.

293
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:19,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And any listener who is willing to trade across the board, we will trade our creature from the Black Lagoon for a Lord of the Rings pinball, please.

294
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:25,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making a mention on behalf of my husband because I really don't care for a creature from the Black Lagoon anyway.

295
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:40,980
[SPEAKER_05]: um but no um i uh i did play uh a lot of uh i actually did play a lot of uh um solitaire just because i have that kind of time which is not really so

296
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:42,526
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about it.

297
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in school, so it's not like I have time to really do a lot of playing.

298
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:46,967
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

299
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:50,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of Rock Band and Guitar Hero this week.

300
00:23:50,848 --> 00:24:07,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I went back to kind of milk the last little bit out of those games that I'm going to before the new sequels come out because we're only a few days away from Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band 2 coming out, so I'm just kind of squeezing the last little bit out of those games because, yeah, I plan to export the Rock Band tracks and then get rid of the game.

301
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even if I only get a few bucks for it, I'll take it.

302
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:12,924
[SPEAKER_03]: because I don't really plan to play it much longer.

303
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:14,514
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you what bugs me about Rock Band.

304
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:26,703
[SPEAKER_03]: You freaking people that play online matches like in score battle or what have you and then when I'm beating you and I'm about to win the song with like 20,000 points over you, you freaking quit so I don't get credit for the song.

305
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:27,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that.

306
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:33,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been leaving negative feedback though on people that do that because that pisses me off and I encourage people to do that.

307
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:44,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget like if people quit early because they can't suck it up that someone beat them at the game, freaking leave them a negative review so it does affect their little score because I think that is such bull crap and the rock band should,

308
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:47,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I did actually have another edition of my gaming week.

309
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:47,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I received a game.

310
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:48,796
[SPEAKER_03]: My wonderful husband has finally brought me home.

311
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:51,056
[SPEAKER_03]: The world ends with you, so I'm going to be playing that.

312
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:51,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

313
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally!

314
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,321
[SPEAKER_03]: When you beat that, I want to borrow it.

315
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:14,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go and check that out.

316
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,042
[SPEAKER_05]: You will be first in line.

317
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,828
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

318
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,640
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

319
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,381
[SPEAKER_05]: This person sucks ass.

320
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:06,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sadly you can't filter down that good, but you can leave the reason why you're putting them on your frown list.

321
00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:07,884
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a smile list and a frown list.

322
00:26:08,204 --> 00:26:10,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to mark their frown because they quit early, you can do that.

323
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:13,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've done that for you rock band fools.

324
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:17,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start reading names on the show of gamer tags that have quit out on me.

325
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:17,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

326
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:22,670
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'll look up the name while you're reading the next story and call them out here on the program.

327
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,130
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be fun.

328
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:26,013
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

329
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:50,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

330
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:51,518
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

331
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:52,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live Arcade.

332
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I checked out Gin Rummy.

333
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:56,960
[SPEAKER_03]: The presentation of that game is actually really nice.

334
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish there was more to it than just Gin Rummy.

335
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:05,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think there's... Sierra, our masters, are doing card games on the computer and such.

336
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:08,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of nice to see them getting into it on Xbox Live Arcade.

337
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:09,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish there had been a little more to it.

338
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:13,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just didn't feel like the price justified it.

339
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:16,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know this sounds harsh, but I could get a real deck of cards.

340
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:17,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again...

341
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:21,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say the same thing about Uno, but yet Uno is so much fun on Xbox Live.

342
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:23,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't explain what it is, the difference.

343
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:32,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, I don't know, maybe it's the fact more people are on Uno or that Uno is so disgustingly simple and you can literally just sit down and play for five minutes and Rummy takes a little more time.

344
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

345
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:34,422
[SPEAKER_05]: How about rock band stuff?

346
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,781
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Rock Band stuff?

347
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:40,184
[SPEAKER_05]: There is actually a Rock Band 2 track list that is ranked by difficulty for Xbox 360.

348
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:41,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on, we're not in story chat.

349
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:43,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, sorry.

350
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:44,347
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

351
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I'm... I gotta get to housekeeping.

352
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,011
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, I thought that you had read your story and I completely blanked, so I'm sorry.

353
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:52,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're starting with a Rock Band story tonight.

354
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:52,893
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

355
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:53,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I thought that you...

356
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:55,795
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright, I'm done with my gaming week.

357
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do housekeeping and then we can talk about Rock Band, okay?

358
00:27:57,996 --> 00:27:59,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I go crawl under the couch now?

359
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:00,437
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're fine, you're fine.

360
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:02,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Housekeeping tonight.

361
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to mention of Penny Arcade coverage.

362
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:10,221
[SPEAKER_03]: The seven hours, eight hours worth of stuff we did at Penny Arcade Expo is up.

363
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really Bobby that did it all because he was there the whole time.

364
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:16,764
[SPEAKER_03]: But we, at least I, pretty much was there all day Friday and all day Saturday.

365
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,745
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura and Loki spent pretty much all their time there too.

366
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:21,066
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

367
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:21,446
[SPEAKER_03]: PAX...

368
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:29,909
[SPEAKER_03]: .allgames.com is there and that's where you can actually get now some video is being posted as well of the interviews that Bobby did.

369
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,630
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually has some interviews and I think I showed up in the first one.

370
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked a question of the JumpGate Evolution guy.

371
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's there and you can download it and it's neat.

372
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:38,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby did a very good job with the videos.

373
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:39,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very happy.

374
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:47,656
[SPEAKER_03]: E4ALL is the next expo on the radar and sadly all three of us are not going to be going to E4ALL but I am.

375
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:51,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go for E4ALL to represent Orange Launch Radio and I know a lot of folks might be thinking why

376
00:28:52,208 --> 00:29:21,634
[SPEAKER_03]: E4ALL does not appear to be having the big exhibitor list of other conventions and to me I actually think that's kind of the charm of it I want to go and promote Orange Lounge Radio to the gamers that will show up and from what I hear All Games is going to have a heck of a booth there their theme has to do with classic games I'm not sure how much I can and can't say about the booth but from what I've heard it's going to be a good time so if you're in the LA area you should come out and check us out at E4ALL I will be there also best for last

377
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,351
[SPEAKER_03]: OLRPSP.com

378
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,341
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

379
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:04,995
[SPEAKER_03]: or heck, if you want to tune in to some of the other programming, tune in at 4.45pm Pacific Sunday night.

380
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:12,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on your PSP to the Orange Lounge Radio All Games listener and you go right to All Games Radio and listen to everything.

381
00:30:12,418 --> 00:30:12,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

382
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:13,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

383
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say how great it is without sounding like I have an ego because Loki did it all.

384
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,722
[SPEAKER_03]: He really did a great job, not just for us representing Orange Lounge Radio but for representing allgames.com.

385
00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:27,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus he let out a series of colorful expletives while he was working on it, and that was pretty funny.

386
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:29,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was funny to watch, so good times.

387
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out, olrpsp.com.

388
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:35,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we're trying something new tonight.

389
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,127
[SPEAKER_03]: OhChat28 is giving an endorsement.

390
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:40,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It says the PSP All Games Radio is pretty damn cool.

391
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:43,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight we're trying something new.

392
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:47,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it is just DarkSakura and myself here in studio, our Skype line is going to be open all night.

393
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:49,771
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take calls as we get them tonight.

394
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:50,671
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying something new.

395
00:30:51,372 --> 00:30:54,633
[SPEAKER_03]: If you feel at any time you want to call in and give us a call, comment on what's going on.

396
00:30:54,913 --> 00:30:55,373
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR

397
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:20,949
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

398
00:31:45,789 --> 00:32:01,162
[SPEAKER_03]: which you know Gabe and Tycho at Penny Arcade they love that and the other cool thing the performers in the PAX pack were actually people that were at Penny Arcade Expo so even if you were not there live at the show it's kind of like you could have PAX in your house a little bit

399
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:07,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can play along to Skullcrusher Mountain by Jonathan Colton, which you gotta love that here at Orange Lounge Radio.

400
00:32:07,827 --> 00:32:08,728
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about that before.

401
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:14,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Livin' on the Corner of Dude and Catastrophe by MC Frontalot and Shhh by Darkest of the Hillside Thickets.

402
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:15,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Three bucks.

403
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:18,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Shhh, by the way, is a previously unreleased track.

404
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:22,818
[SPEAKER_03]: The other two songs have been released before and they are all master recordings.

405
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:29,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have Rock Band and you want to feel good about donating to Child's Play and get some music at the same time, there you have it.

406
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:31,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Band Packs Pack.

407
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:35,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do my story now.

408
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:38,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So, gee, DarkSakura, do you have anything you want to share with us by chance?

409
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:40,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, stop making fun of me, okay?

410
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't resist.

411
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:43,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my job.

412
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:45,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Infinite Undiscovery has an ad on this.

413
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:45,705
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

414
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that was pretty, too.

415
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:50,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention Infinite Undiscovery.

416
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:55,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought it, and I played it for an hour, and I was extremely disappointed.

417
00:32:56,144 --> 00:33:21,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to what I played at PAX I thought at PAX I had a good time at PAX But I really hated the opening of this game I think God, the whole ogre chase thing Is not a way to start the game That was a horrible idea And it really just made me disinterested almost in the whole thing It doesn't suck how like one poorly planned level Can just ruin an entire game I'm gonna try and stick it out and try to get to some of the parts I saw at Penny Arcade Expo But I was not happy with Infinite and Discovery Anyhow, sorry, go ahead

418
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:33,959
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, the song list that I mentioned before in order of difficulty is for Rock Band 2, sorry, is Eye of the Tiger, Float On, Today Hungry Like the Wolf, Cool for Cats, Pretend We're Dead.

419
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that song.

420
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,304
[SPEAKER_05]: My Own Worst Enemy, One Step Closer, We Got the Beat, That's What You Get, Rebel... Wait, this is guitar difficulty, right?

421
00:33:42,294 --> 00:33:51,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Rebel Girl, So What You Want, Drain You, New Kid in School, Hello There, Lump, American Woman, Mountain Song, Man in the Box, R-Truth, White Wedding, E-Pro, Solid, Psycho Killer,

422
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:06,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

423
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:07,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

424
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:08,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I meant Solid is the third stage.

425
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Psycho Killer, Spirit in the Sky, Kids in America, Feel the Pain.

426
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a good song, too.

427
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:34,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Give It Away, Conventional Lover, A Jagged Gorgeous Winter, Bad Reputation, Pump It Up, You Oughta Know, Go Your Own Way, Welcome to the Neighborhood, and then Moderate is PDA, Shooting Star, Living on a Prayer, Deluxe, Girls Not Gray, One Way or Another, Tangled Up in Blue, Alex Chilton, Alive, The Middle, Aqualung,

428
00:34:36,134 --> 00:34:37,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Aqualung, cool.

429
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:38,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Supreme Girl.

430
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:54,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Challenging, we have Down with the Sickness, Give It All, Where'd You Go, Come Out and Play, Everlong, Pinball Wizard, that's also really cool, Rob the President, Testify, Uncontrollable Urge, Any Way You Want It, Round and Round, Night Lies, and then, what?

431
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:58,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, thank you, Harmonix, for the journey.

432
00:34:58,708 --> 00:34:59,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

433
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:04,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Nightmare Level, now I'm thinking of Doom, you know, was the last one, hurt me plenty.

434
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:05,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

435
00:35:06,676 --> 00:35:07,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't want to die.

436
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:17,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Let There Be Rock, Alabama Getaway, Lazy Eye, Teenage Riot, The Trees, Vault Edition, Carry On, Wayward Son, Rockin' Me, Ace of Spades 08.

437
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:21,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I somehow missed that Carry On My Wayward Son is in that game.

438
00:35:21,795 --> 00:35:22,915
[SPEAKER_03]: That is awesome.

439
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:24,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

440
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:24,817
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good.

441
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:29,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually glad you're reading the whole list because I forgot about how some of these songs are in Rock Band 2.

442
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:30,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be pretty awesome.

443
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's why I just said to do the whole thing.

444
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:32,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Spoon Man makes me happy.

445
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:37,825
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, before Chris Cornell damaged his voice and doesn't sound as awesome as he used to.

446
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:47,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost Easy, Chop Suey, Shacklers, Revenge, and then Impossible Mode is Master Exploder, Ramblin' Man, Shoulder to the Plow, Get Clean,

447
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:58,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Colony of Birchmen, Peace Cells, Souls of Black, Battery, Panic Attack, Visions, Painkiller.

448
00:35:58,054 --> 00:35:59,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

449
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:06,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Now see, the only bummer is that a lot of the songs I really want to play are not in the difficult category.

450
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:08,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay, you know, I understand.

451
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:13,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they want the difficult songs to be the more guitar, metal stuff that I don't really listen to usually.

452
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:15,338
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, as a whole...

453
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:18,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Master Exploder Master Exploder Master Exploder

454
00:36:38,513 --> 00:36:42,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious what you guys think about the Rock Band 2 song list and the difficulties.

455
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,644
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Laundry.

456
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:49,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of curious if people are actually going to call or if everybody's going to wait until the end like usual.

457
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:51,933
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why this is an experiment tonight.

458
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:54,432
[SPEAKER_03]: More Rock Band.

459
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:59,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we just have a crap load of music game news tonight, especially, you know, as we're on the brink of a Rock Band 2 being released.

460
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:01,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of music game news tonight.

461
00:37:01,895 --> 00:37:07,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And the details are finally out for how you are going to get your Rock Band 1 songs into Rock Band 2.

462
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:09,137
[SPEAKER_03]: It is available to happen now.

463
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:13,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though Rock Band 2 is not technically out yet, you can start the exporting process.

464
00:37:13,138 --> 00:37:21,761
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole process takes about 10 minutes, and it'll set you back $5, and it'll allow you to take 55 songs, take them out of Rock Band 1, and put them into Rock Band 2.

465
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:23,202
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

466
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

467
00:38:07,315 --> 00:38:09,115
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

468
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:56,657
[SPEAKER_03]: and anything you've downloaded from before so that's that's gonna be a heck of a song list even though you know a lot of you have already played but that's neat I'm looking forward to that uh it is a bummer that they have to recharge you for that but I guess that's a licensing thing and there's just no way around it and admittedly five dollars not too bad not too bad

469
00:38:59,063 --> 00:39:05,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to do that quickly before Rock Band 2 comes out because you know there's going to be tons of people that are ripping the songs and then sell the game back.

470
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:12,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the game doesn't pull a gotcha and at some point you have to insert the original Rock Band disc or else we'll be screwed.

471
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:16,076
[SPEAKER_05]: How about some Guitar Hero World Tour news?

472
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:18,637
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes me happy because I'm a fangirl.

473
00:39:20,939 --> 00:39:25,723
[SPEAKER_05]: The latest who's going to be in the game as a playable character is Sting.

474
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:30,384
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me very, very happy because I was a big Police fan.

475
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:40,454
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also supposed to be recreating Jimi Hendrix, Ozzy Osbourne, Zach Wilde, and Billy Corgan.

476
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:42,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool.

477
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:48,381
[SPEAKER_05]: But you just have to find out, I guess, if anyone else is going to be in Guitar Hero World Tour when it comes out.

478
00:39:48,582 --> 00:39:48,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

479
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:51,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero Gorillaz Edition

480
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:19,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe so.

481
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong, but I don't believe so.

482
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:23,231
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had Radiohead.

483
00:40:23,331 --> 00:40:24,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure Chatwell will correct us if we're wrong.

484
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:25,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

485
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:28,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see a Gorillaz edition.

486
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:28,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

487
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:40,599
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's pretty rad is that in Rock Band 1, when you're playing online, you get a random song that you play against your opponent with, which I wish Guitar Hero did so that way everybody didn't pick Through the Fire and the Flames.

488
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:41,920
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

489
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:10,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Betelbum is in Rock Band

490
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:23,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that song.

491
00:41:24,229 --> 00:41:26,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, if I was gonna... Girls and Boys, hello.

492
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,370
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

493
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:30,792
[SPEAKER_05]: For just the guitar in it, because I'm sorry, even though he had to be an ass.

494
00:41:31,213 --> 00:41:40,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Graham Coxon is one of the, I would have to say, best guitar players out there, and I would love to have had Charmless Man in there.

495
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the guitar in that would be really fun.

496
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:47,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby's in chat saying, I want to play Rock Band with Rob, and I also want to play Civ Rev with Rob.

497
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:48,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it!

498
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:51,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Sivrev, Matthew Sweet

499
00:42:07,064 --> 00:42:34,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And this actually is a little bit older news, it came up last week, but Penny Arcade Expo was kind of distracting us Matthew Sweet is actually considering that he's going to be doing a lawsuit against Guitar Hero 2 He says, quote, I've been trying to see if I can get a lawsuit against them because they never asked to use the song A lot of kids have gotten into his music because of the inclusion of the song in the game Quote, I found out that the Romantics have a lawsuit going against the makers of that game because of the song What I Like About You

500
00:42:35,382 --> 00:42:38,312
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I don't know if the Romantics are going to win their suit, but it's really weird.

501
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:41,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never sued anyone in my life, and I don't think it would amount to much anyway.

502
00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:51,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's thinking about actually, even though he kind of admits more people get into the music, he wants to sue the people that did Guitar Hero for putting a song in there.

503
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it was probably his record label that signed it away.

504
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:56,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't make sense.

505
00:42:56,798 --> 00:43:03,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly though, because I was actually, I don't know if you remembered, I was really surprised to see Matthew Sweet songs in there.

506
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:08,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've actually been a fan of Matthew Sweet since I was in high school.

507
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever since...

508
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,360
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I take that back.

509
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:18,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever since college, because he did a couple of videos, one of them for a girlfriend that had clips from Cobra in it.

510
00:43:18,565 --> 00:43:19,666
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a big anime fan.

511
00:43:19,686 --> 00:43:20,506
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I found out.

512
00:43:20,727 --> 00:43:25,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And also one with lots of Urasayatsura clips in the video.

513
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:26,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been waiting.

514
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,311
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the other one.

515
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:54,012
[SPEAKER_05]: and on top of that I've been I picked up quite a number of his albums because I have my favorite album that he did is Altered Beast and he did one called Son of Altered Beast that has some of my favorite songs there so to hear that he's wanting to sue a video game company for promoting his music because I thought that me and five other people liked him that's just sort of ridiculous I think

516
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:58,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, you can be a fan of someone and still admit, you know, smack, what are you thinking?

517
00:43:58,551 --> 00:43:59,152
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, right?

518
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:04,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if one of my favorite musicians was doing this, I would say, you know, I like you, but what are you thinking, dude?

519
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:07,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ranma, yes, it was Space Adventure Cobra.

520
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:13,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lot of clips from the super uber long movie version.

521
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says sue someone.

522
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:16,101
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the American way.

523
00:44:17,102 --> 00:44:18,043
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the weird thing.

524
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:21,645
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Matthew Sweet references the romantics thing, but that was actually thrown out of court.

525
00:44:22,335 --> 00:44:23,396
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

526
00:44:41,332 --> 00:44:47,357
[SPEAKER_03]: You suing Guitar Hero will go over about as well as when Metallica sued Napster.

527
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:50,440
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually kind of understand why Metallica sued Napster.

528
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,862
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this case, why so upset?

529
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:55,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets more people into your music and so on.

530
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:58,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he just upset he's not getting more money out of the whole thing?

531
00:44:59,427 --> 00:45:02,129
[SPEAKER_03]: If you sell CDs because of it, what's the big fucking deal?

532
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:09,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now we've spawned a whole Takahashi anime thing in chat because I happen to mention Urasayatsura.

533
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:17,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I think that Fire Tripper is a little better than some of those if you have to go for individual stuff.

534
00:45:17,737 --> 00:45:18,037
[SPEAKER_05]: The end.

535
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:21,259
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, that interview is from the North County Times.

536
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:25,361
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to check that out for yourself, nctimes.com did the interview on August 21st.

537
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:27,957
[SPEAKER_03]: which was when we weren't here.

538
00:45:28,698 --> 00:45:36,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully he snaps out of it and doesn't end up suing the game because I think that would be a little silly and is just going to get a more negative publicity amongst the people playing this game than positive.

539
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:43,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if he has issues with it, he needs to take it up with his record company or whoever signed on the dotted line and licensed this song away.

540
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:48,145
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the person he needs to be going after if he doesn't want this to happen in the future, in my opinion.

541
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, your opinion counts because you are an internet celebrity.

542
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:52,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

543
00:45:53,466 --> 00:45:53,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

544
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:55,067
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

545
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:57,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'd say that, but okay, I'll take it.

546
00:45:58,138 --> 00:45:59,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on, the internet is serious business!

547
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:09,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, for something that... There is quite a bit of classic rock fans still left in the world.

548
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:11,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm one, definitely.

549
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:18,113
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some classic acts that are going to be re-recording some master tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour.

550
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:21,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these are actually in...

551
00:46:22,984 --> 00:46:27,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to say MC5's Kick Out the Jams is going to be one.

552
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:35,251
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually having some help from Alice in Chains member Jerry Cantrell and Guns N' Roses' Gilby Clark.

553
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:43,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Sex Pistols is putting up Pretty Vacant and Motorhead re-recorded Overkill.

554
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:45,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Motorhead, by the way.

555
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:47,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's pretty neat.

556
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:57,404
[SPEAKER_05]: There also, though, was apparently a little bit of trouble with some of the tracks they were wanting to put in, so they're all working on trying to get the bugs ironed out.

557
00:47:00,326 --> 00:47:00,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

558
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:01,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be interesting.

559
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:02,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

560
00:47:02,728 --> 00:47:03,729
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens with that.

561
00:47:04,902 --> 00:47:10,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we've been talking a lot about music games, but let's not forget the music game that started it all, at least for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

562
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:19,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution is still trucking along, and Hottest Party 2 and DDRX have gotten some more song announcements this week about some of the songs that you're going to find in the game.

563
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:46,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dice Revolution Hottest Party 2 it's completely made up of covers but actually now there's also going to be some Konami originals in the game and those were some of the songs they announced this week for example we have Desert Journey by DJ Taka a new song that's going to show up in the game Terra, Kyoka Suigetsu Rou is coming out and if you want to look at the full list yourself ddronlinecommunity.com if you want to see some of the other songs that are going to be in the game

564
00:47:48,044 --> 00:47:53,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to also mention the songs that are coming to DDRX on the PlayStation 2.

565
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:54,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Some new licensed songs.

566
00:47:54,866 --> 00:47:55,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this was interesting.

567
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:59,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Naropa is coming back and the reason why that's interesting is because they're one of the different drum artists.

568
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:02,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you have the different drum songs going on to PlayStation 2.

569
00:48:03,408 --> 00:48:06,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel is the song by Naropa that you're going to see in DDRX.

570
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:08,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Some more new edits.

571
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,971
[SPEAKER_03]: of old classic DDR songs.

572
00:48:11,011 --> 00:48:15,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Butterfly and Dubby Dub were getting recut and re-edited for DDRX.

573
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:16,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you heard about that.

574
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:19,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other songs got announced.

575
00:48:19,493 --> 00:48:20,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Hero is coming.

576
00:48:21,154 --> 00:48:21,654
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, remember?

577
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:23,194
[SPEAKER_03]: La-da-dee-da-da.

578
00:48:24,394 --> 00:48:25,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You are my hero.

579
00:48:27,255 --> 00:48:27,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, get this.

580
00:48:28,516 --> 00:48:31,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Get Up and Move is also getting a new edit.

581
00:48:31,457 --> 00:48:32,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember S&K?

582
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:33,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Get Up and Move.

583
00:48:35,218 --> 00:48:36,318
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't a good song.

584
00:48:37,403 --> 00:48:37,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Petshot Boys

585
00:48:52,888 --> 00:49:03,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Open from the Dub Pistols, synthesized from the punk label Fat Wreck Chords, the artist The Apixies was synthesized.

586
00:49:03,696 --> 00:49:04,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like a variety of music.

587
00:49:05,017 --> 00:49:08,900
[SPEAKER_03]: You have synth pop, punk, and bad music.

588
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,100
[SPEAKER_03]: All different genres.

589
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:10,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

590
00:49:12,188 --> 00:49:13,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Something for everyone in DDRX, it sounds like.

591
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:15,630
[SPEAKER_05]: The bottom of the barrel of the Konami originals.

592
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:16,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

593
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:18,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to see if there's comments from chat.

594
00:49:18,352 --> 00:49:23,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Some people are yelling out, get up and move.

595
00:49:24,276 --> 00:49:26,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee's remembering there was a sweet freestyle to it.

596
00:49:27,778 --> 00:49:30,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet there was some pretty awesome freestyle to that song, though, actually.

597
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen awesome freestyle done to really crappy songs, so...

598
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee also says that they need to do the R21 patch for DDRX Arcade.

599
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:41,923
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not thinking that's actually going to happen.

600
00:49:42,003 --> 00:49:43,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Needs more 2 Unlimited.

601
00:49:44,924 --> 00:49:45,444
[SPEAKER_05]: How about no?

602
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:49,606
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 Unlimited is like the quintessential jock jams band.

603
00:49:49,926 --> 00:49:50,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

604
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,406
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the Twilight Zone

605
00:50:13,632 --> 00:50:15,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Viva Pinata, Pocket Paradise, The Price is Right, The Game, Ubisoft

606
00:50:38,058 --> 00:50:39,238
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes you happy, doesn't it?

607
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:40,799
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not Bob Barker, is it?

608
00:50:40,899 --> 00:50:41,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

609
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:44,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things just don't need to be made into games.

610
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,640
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to do classic Price is Right for you.

611
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:53,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Also that does not need to be made into games, Hell's Kitchen is coming out on the Wii along with the Price is Right port on the Wii.

612
00:50:53,122 --> 00:50:57,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And Hell's Kitchen also making its way to the DS shows just how easy games can go back and forth between the DS and the Wii.

613
00:50:58,443 --> 00:51:00,704
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're more of a PC gamer, guess what?

614
00:51:00,744 --> 00:51:05,785
[SPEAKER_03]: You get Romance of the Three Kingdoms Part 11 comes out this week on PC.

615
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:09,622
[SPEAKER_05]: One would think that romance by now would be stale and dead.

616
00:51:11,103 --> 00:51:12,583
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd be on Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.

617
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:13,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.

618
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it means romance in the classical sense.

619
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:20,346
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there are just rabid, rabid fans of that series.

620
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:23,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think all the way back to when that series was on the NES.

621
00:51:24,028 --> 00:51:26,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I spent a lot of nights playing Nobunaga's Ambition.

622
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:28,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, those games were awesome.

623
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:29,170
[SPEAKER_03]: They really were.

624
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's neat that they've lived on through all this time.

625
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:36,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Maze of Fate DS, a new role-playing game coming out for the DS this week as well.

626
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:41,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dragon Ball Z Trilogy, because you just can never have enough Dragon Ball.

627
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:42,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out on the PlayStation 2.

628
00:51:43,297 --> 00:51:48,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, and if you want some packaged games, CSI Super Pack on the PC.

629
00:51:49,021 --> 00:51:49,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Little known fact.

630
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe this isn't a little known fact, but sometimes overlooked fact.

631
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:59,427
[SPEAKER_03]: The CSI games are designed by the same folks who are very popular for their recent Strong Bad game.

632
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:00,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So something to think about.

633
00:52:02,056 --> 00:52:04,978
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to laugh off a CSI game, it might not be as bad as you think.

634
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:06,479
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you know.

635
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:11,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I did play the Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people.

636
00:52:11,482 --> 00:52:11,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what'd you think?

637
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

638
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:15,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially with the 7-track player.

639
00:52:15,304 --> 00:52:19,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It said that it was short-lived because the faulty part of it was the on-switch.

640
00:52:19,587 --> 00:52:19,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

641
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:21,168
[SPEAKER_05]: There was none.

642
00:52:23,746 --> 00:52:28,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta read some comments here from chat because they're making fun of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms thing.

643
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,655
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD says, it needs to be like Madden.

644
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:33,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Romance of the Three Kingdoms 09 with a new roster.

645
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:38,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And GameGuru reminds us there has to be a marriage of the Three Kingdoms first for there to be a divorce.

646
00:52:38,586 --> 00:52:40,249
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been part four.

647
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:52,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's using romance in an all-encompassing way because right now they're on the ongoing legal battle for custody of the Petuala.

648
00:52:52,649 --> 00:52:59,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And Quiltipo makes the mandatory joke, in-joke here, how long can Lube and Cow-Cow go at it?

649
00:53:00,274 --> 00:53:02,216
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Quiltipo wants to know.

650
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:03,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, baby.

651
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:07,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what game he's been playing.

652
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:08,500
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, forget it.

653
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,010
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about other news?

654
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:12,651
[SPEAKER_05]: How about it?

655
00:53:12,811 --> 00:53:14,072
[SPEAKER_05]: More stuff!

656
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:15,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all coming out on the 12th.

657
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,115
[SPEAKER_05]: At least in Europe.

658
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:30,664
[SPEAKER_05]: We have GTR Evolution on PC, Baja on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and PS2, and R-Type Command on PSP.

659
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:31,685
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it!

660
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Drive Thru, Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200, You Lose, Good Day Sir

661
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:52,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats, I guess.

662
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they recognizing us?

663
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:54,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, it's a Thursday.

664
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:54,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

665
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:55,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they recognizing us?

666
00:53:55,492 --> 00:53:55,992
[SPEAKER_03]: A holiday now?

667
00:53:56,372 --> 00:53:57,553
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I asked off that day.

668
00:53:57,593 --> 00:53:59,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you go to San Francisco and go to art galleries?

669
00:53:59,894 --> 00:54:00,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gotcha.

670
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:01,795
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's actually Loki's birthday.

671
00:54:02,195 --> 00:54:02,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

672
00:54:02,595 --> 00:54:04,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that might be part of the reason he's not here.

673
00:54:04,436 --> 00:54:11,340
[SPEAKER_03]: He might be at a little thing for his day job, but I think secretly he might be wanting to spend some birthday time with the wife because his birthday is actually September 11th.

674
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You never forget when his birthday is.

675
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:14,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my birthday was the Waco thing.

676
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So what tragedy happens on yours?

677
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I did not get tragedy.

678
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:22,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some good things happen on my birthday.

679
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:25,922
[SPEAKER_03]: One, sodomy laws were abolished in Texas on my birthday.

680
00:54:28,162 --> 00:54:29,902
[SPEAKER_05]: My birthday was also the day before Hitler's birthday.

681
00:54:30,363 --> 00:54:33,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to also point out Strom Thurmond died on my birthday.

682
00:54:37,884 --> 00:54:40,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying, you know, you asked what happened on my birthday.

683
00:54:40,064 --> 00:54:40,484
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

684
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:43,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Draw whatever conclusions you want.

685
00:54:44,605 --> 00:54:45,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob I like pie Do you?

686
00:54:45,446 --> 00:54:46,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob I'll kill you Guess what?

687
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:06,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, look, let's move to Japan and the release date's over there.

688
00:55:06,779 --> 00:55:11,103
[SPEAKER_03]: On Thursday, September 11th, Viva Piñata, Garden Wa Dai Punch.

689
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:13,706
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that just here as Viva Piñata Part 2.

690
00:55:14,607 --> 00:55:15,548
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the subtitle for that?

691
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:16,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.

692
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:19,412
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Viva Piñata 2, Something in Paradise?

693
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:22,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a lot of people that are actually really into that game over here.

694
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:24,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Punching people in the face in Paradise?

695
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually seen a lot of really positive reviews on it.

696
00:55:27,076 --> 00:55:28,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to rent it or something.

697
00:55:28,216 --> 00:55:28,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Death to piñatas?

698
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:31,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you can kill the piñatas yet.

699
00:55:31,797 --> 00:55:35,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I am waiting for the minigame where you finally take a baseball bat to your damn piñatas.

700
00:55:37,118 --> 00:55:38,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we had that happen yet?

701
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:44,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And find that their guts are made out of, you know, Tootsie Pops and Jolly Ranchers.

702
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:52,533
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD in chat says, I leave you to envision Sky celebrated the abolishing of sodomy laws with Strom Thurmond on his birthday yourself.

703
00:55:53,874 --> 00:55:55,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just leave it to the imagination, folks.

704
00:55:56,616 --> 00:55:57,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you have to go there?

[SPEAKER_03]: Double Clutch comes out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

706
00:56:00,338 --> 00:56:01,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of double entendres.

707
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:04,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Infinite Undiscovery.

708
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

709
00:56:08,142 --> 00:56:11,104
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all ways that you could celebrate the repeal of sodomy laws.

710
00:56:11,184 --> 00:56:12,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Double Clutch and Infinite Undiscovery.

711

[SPEAKER_03]: Sega Ages 2500 Volume 33 Fantasy Zone Complete Collection Do you know how much this would cost you to import?

719
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,781
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, I think Sega heard that E all the way in Japan.

720
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:13,282
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 says, Jamie just fangasmed.

721
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get a mop in the studio, please?

722
00:57:40,129 --> 00:57:40,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

723
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:46,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually held the microphone away from my face so that I didn't break anybody's eardrums.

724
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:49,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you all owe me money now for saving you a medical expense.

725
00:57:49,994 --> 00:57:52,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and you know I love Princess Soft.

726
00:57:52,296 --> 00:57:57,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And Princess Soft is releasing a game called Sashu Shiken Kujira Alive.

727
00:57:57,398 --> 00:57:58,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet, so sweet.

728
00:57:58,439 --> 00:58:00,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out from Princess Soft on the PlayStation 2.

729
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can visit the handhelds real quick and then we'll get back to some of the gaming news.

730
00:58:04,722 --> 00:58:06,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob likes the handhelds, don't you?

731
00:58:06,363 --> 00:58:10,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Spore Creatures is coming out on the DS as well.

732
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,409
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, gosh, a bunch of other games.

733
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:22,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Gakenmu Henshubu Kanshu Chojujinsu Research File comes out on the Nintendo DS as well, as well as some DS Vision games.

734
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:25,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And a game called, what is this?

735
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:28,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Hoshizora no Comic Garden.

736
00:58:29,905 --> 00:58:30,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that's an anime.

737
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:30,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

738
00:58:31,647 --> 00:58:34,928
[SPEAKER_03]: because it has a limited edition, usually limited edition games or games based on animes.

739
00:58:35,288 --> 00:58:37,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the PSP this week, nothing.

740
00:58:39,229 --> 00:58:39,730
[SPEAKER_03]: No games for you.

741
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom, the game.

742
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing for you on PSP, sorry to say.

743
00:58:43,271 --> 00:58:43,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

744
00:58:43,891 --> 00:58:44,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull forward.

745
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:48,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm adding that, by the way, to the list of official Orange Jones Radio wanted games.

746
00:58:48,452 --> 00:58:49,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mom, the game?

747
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:49,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mom, the game.

748
00:58:49,753 --> 00:58:51,053
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you do in your mom, the game?

749
00:58:55,235 --> 00:58:55,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Zing.

750
00:58:58,476 --> 00:58:59,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.

751
00:59:02,482 --> 00:59:04,463
[SPEAKER_05]: You've caught me in a very weird mood.

752
00:59:04,683 --> 00:59:05,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

753
00:59:06,124 --> 00:59:07,345
[SPEAKER_05]: How about more news?

754
00:59:07,485 --> 00:59:07,865
[SPEAKER_02]: How about it?

755
00:59:07,885 --> 00:59:10,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Because no gnoos is good gnoos with Gary Gnu.

756
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:13,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And if none of you get that, then you're too young.

757
00:59:13,629 --> 00:59:14,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel old now.

758
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:41,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Eurogamer Expo Eurogamer is actually a very big, very popular site overseas and they carry lots of good news and have Eurogamer TV and I actually go to that site quite often but Eurogamer Network is having Eurogamer Expo and I've said Eurogamer a whole bunch of times in a row but it's at the Old Truman Brewery October 28th through 29th in London and

759
00:59:43,265 --> 00:59:48,290
[SPEAKER_05]: and there will be some more details up there but it will be two sessions each day 11 a.m.

760
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:48,950
[SPEAKER_05]: to 4 p.m.

761
00:59:49,271 --> 00:59:49,871
[SPEAKER_05]: and 5 p.m.

762
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:50,992
[SPEAKER_05]: to 10 p.m.

763
00:59:51,593 --> 01:00:05,505
[SPEAKER_05]: also I'm going to be playable there Street Fighter 4 Prince of Persia Mirror's Edge LittleBigPlanet Tomb Raider Underworld Far Cry 2 Fallout 3 Saints Row 2 and many more in other words all the shit we already played at PAX hey

764
01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:06,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

765
01:00:06,746 --> 01:00:07,746
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think this is a great idea.

766
01:00:07,826 --> 01:00:09,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just... Actually, we didn't get... I gotta haze a little.

767
01:00:09,887 --> 01:00:10,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

768
01:00:10,268 --> 01:00:10,448
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

769
01:00:10,468 --> 01:00:11,768
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get Street Fighter 4.

770
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:13,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, alright.

771
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:14,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't believe I saw any Prince of Persia.

772
01:00:16,771 --> 01:00:17,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just messing.

773
01:00:18,792 --> 01:00:20,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Gotta get your feathers all ruffled.

774
01:00:20,153 --> 01:00:22,514
[SPEAKER_05]: We did get Velvet Assassin and that girl needed to eat too.

775
01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:39,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So at any rate, I would actually very much love for any of our European listeners, if you're going, write us up, review, take photos, get back, get some internet celebrity for yourself through our site.

776
01:00:40,408 --> 01:00:44,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Which hopefully we'll have our new site done by the time Eurogamer Expo happens.

777
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:46,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally will be at a steampunk convention.

778
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:51,771
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think provoked the idea of a Eurogamer Expo?

779
01:00:53,437 --> 01:00:54,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't Really All They Have Is Leipzig

780
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:18,198
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to... I liked Tap House, but it was too hot.

781
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:19,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Tap House was cool.

782
01:01:19,499 --> 01:01:20,039
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the other one?

783
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:20,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Vons?

784
01:01:20,399 --> 01:01:20,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Vons.

785
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:23,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, like the supermarket chain here, but it's a bar up in Seattle.

786
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:31,901
[SPEAKER_05]: They had taps from different breweries all over the wall, and they had big, bold letters on their banner outside.

787
01:01:32,441 --> 01:01:33,821
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not serve bud.

788
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, this place is already fantastic.

789
01:01:38,602 --> 01:01:43,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they had really, really good food, and I tried some very interesting beer.

790
01:01:44,721 --> 01:01:45,682
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of my favorite places.

791
01:01:45,722 --> 01:01:50,609
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not have... I gotta say, Seattle folks, we did not have a single bit of bad food up in Seattle.

792
01:01:50,769 --> 01:01:51,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I really didn't.

793
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:53,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all know how to eat.

794
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:59,521
[SPEAKER_05]: We did eat some fairly... A couple places we went to were a bit more upscale than I think we were anticipating, but...

795
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:01,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, I've eaten some shitty food here locally.

796
01:02:02,002 --> 01:02:06,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I've eaten off the menu at Cheesecake Factory, which, you know, I don't enjoy their lunch at all.

797
01:02:06,463 --> 01:02:07,683
[SPEAKER_05]: They have good breakfast, though.

798
01:02:07,783 --> 01:02:10,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think... You don't go to Cheesecake Factory for the food.

799
01:02:10,784 --> 01:02:11,444
[SPEAKER_03]: You go for the cheesecake.

800
01:02:11,924 --> 01:02:17,326
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had some great food in Seattle, which, ironically, there was a lot of people going to Cheesecake Factory in Seattle, but I was kind of like, what's the point?

801
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:17,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You can eat that at home.

802
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:19,386
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to the Sega World Grill, and that was cute.

803
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:20,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega World Grill was great.

804
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:23,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Best burger I've ever had and really good pizza.

805
01:02:23,988 --> 01:02:24,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway.

806
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:24,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

807
01:02:24,748 --> 01:02:25,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

808
01:02:25,228 --> 01:02:25,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Foodio!

809
01:02:26,448 --> 01:02:26,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Launch Foodio.

810
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:31,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, we could eat some Foodio and play Halo 3.

811
01:02:32,496 --> 01:02:37,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo 3 Mythic was apparently spotted by some folks at Penny Arcade Expo.

812
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:41,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo 3 Mythic showed up just before the Penny Arcade Expo official kickoff

813
01:02:41,728 --> 01:02:44,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if one of the press folks actually snuck a picture of that, what was going on.

814
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:53,072
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently, Halo 3 Mythic is something that was kind of poking through, maybe something that shouldn't be announced yet that's going to be coming out soon.

815
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:58,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Halo 3 Mythic only has a multiplayer-only menu, and it's version 1.2.

816
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:01,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

817
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:27,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Which has no gamer score, but is an achievement nonetheless.

818
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:31,896
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see the full list of those, they are available on some various blogs out there.

819
01:03:31,956 --> 01:03:36,078
[SPEAKER_03]: They went originally on the Ascendant Justic Forum.

820
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:37,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

821
01:03:40,161 --> 01:03:40,702
[SPEAKER_03]: You Halo 3 fans.

822
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:46,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, other things to check out that would definitely enable some Halo 3 action.

823
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:52,269
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox 360 price cut is official, actually, as of the 5th of this month.

824
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:56,892
[SPEAKER_05]: They've dropped the price of the 60GB to $299, and the Xbox 360 Arcade to $199, and the 360 Elite to $399.

825
01:04:07,538 --> 01:04:17,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, I guess it's just going to pave the way for more sales, and I hope that they're not... I would think that they've gotten past where they were working at a loss on their consoles, don't you think?

826
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:24,376
[SPEAKER_03]: They might still be taking a little loss, but I think for them to be price point under the Wii, it might just be worth it.

827
01:04:25,442 --> 01:04:49,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, and to be perfectly honest, and this is again my opinion, and a system is only as good as the games that are on it, as I've said many times, but I think that the Xbox 360 right now has the better library, and I think them dropping the price of the systems while keeping the titles where they are now is a very smart move and should definitely turn in a profit for them.

828
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:50,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a very good idea.

829
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:51,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Because honestly...

830
01:04:52,009 --> 01:04:52,769
[SPEAKER_05]: The games are great.

831
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:56,731
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been very few things that I haven't really enjoyed playing on Xbox 360.

832
01:04:57,531 --> 01:04:59,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't like Cheap?

833
01:04:59,952 --> 01:05:00,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Who?

834
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:01,553
[SPEAKER_03]: No one.

835
01:05:01,793 --> 01:05:03,613
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that bought Yaris.

836
01:05:05,574 --> 01:05:05,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Zing.

837
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:06,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that.

838
01:05:07,355 --> 01:05:08,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, that's it.

839
01:05:09,836 --> 01:05:10,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't like Cheap?

840
01:05:12,837 --> 01:05:15,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like Cheap's cooking show on Parappa.

841
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:29,746
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if the price cuts move more systems, which a lot of folks are forecasting that it's going to move big amounts of systems because there's going to be people to go in trying to get Wii's and folks aren't going to be able to get it, so they're going to get an Xbox 360.

842
01:05:30,987 --> 01:05:31,328
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

843
01:05:32,388 --> 01:05:37,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Katamari's Forever in chat says, Oh no, now the Wii will have lower sales than the 360.

844
01:05:38,112 --> 01:05:40,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Really though, if you want Wii, you'll get Wii no matter what.

845
01:05:40,794 --> 01:05:41,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Scalper, anyone?

846
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:46,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Misty says, I still say poopy on arcade.

847
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:49,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Not enough storage space for my planned Rock Band downloads.

848
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:49,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point.

849
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:58,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though the system might be cheaper than the Wii, it's not the greatest Xbox 360 system and I think there's going to be a lot of people out there that are going to find this out the hard way.

850
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:03,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have to fork over that extra $100 anyway a little later on for the hard drive.

851
01:06:04,025 --> 01:06:05,106
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be tough.

852
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:27,747
[SPEAKER_03]: so we got one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week I can't stress this enough this is rumor and rumor only but apparently it's very interesting that this rumor is timed as soon after Penny Arcade Expo as it is and that rumor is that right now E3 the board behind E3 is in talks to make E3 public

853
01:06:28,587 --> 01:06:29,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

854
01:06:29,248 --> 01:06:33,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worked so well for Penny Arcade Expo, they are talking about making it public.

855
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:43,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, the idea has officially been brought forward to the Entertainment Software Association, and that could mean as soon as next year, the show could be public.

856
01:06:44,764 --> 01:06:45,685
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

857
01:07:10,723 --> 01:07:35,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Pax is an E3 and we've heard tons and tons of comparisons and that Pax is what everybody thought E3 was going to be when they heard about E3 and Pax is just all this stuff but just asking directly comparing the two shows since we've been fortunate to go to both and talking about old E3 and Pax at least I know what I noticed one thing I noticed people were way more laid back at Pax

858
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:36,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

859
01:07:37,008 --> 01:07:38,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was fantastic.

860
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:45,354
[SPEAKER_05]: With that level of... Keep in mind, you've got so many people in such an area.

861
01:07:47,155 --> 01:07:51,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Even as big as E3 was, there's going to be tensions running.

862
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:55,641
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a lot of professionals that have to get from appointment to appointment to appointment.

863
01:07:56,282 --> 01:07:59,424
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to do that, especially our last year at E3.

864
01:07:59,924 --> 01:08:02,946
[SPEAKER_05]: How many appointments did we set up trying to get interviews and visiting?

865
01:08:03,366 --> 01:08:03,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

866
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:04,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And

867
01:08:06,068 --> 01:08:33,546
[SPEAKER_05]: this without having because we didn't have to schedule interviews the developers were you know those who made it we're just there chatting about everything and being so open about about the games and letting everyone take pictures and not having all this crap especially screens people with a bug up their butt not letting you take pictures which they did this year here at PAX they were great about it but it was just so completely laid back everyone was friendly and even the enforcers I'd say they were all fantastic they did a great job and they were friendly and

868
01:08:33,686 --> 01:08:35,267
[SPEAKER_05]: They were very personable, the ones I dealt with.

869
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:39,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pardon my French, but everybody had to stick up their fucking ass at E3.

870
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:43,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's always been kind of my problem with E3 is that people are very snobby.

871
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:48,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's like the LA thing or what it is, but I don't like getting treated like shit at a video game expo.

872
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:56,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've heard the stories I've told on this show about some of these big media gatherings that we've been to in the past and how we're looked down on because, you know, independent podcast.

873
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,238
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have millions of listeners.

874
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like, there's a bunch... Whoa, I just threw something.

875
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:01,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so angry.

876
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:02,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

877
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:29,043
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know people a lot of people have sticks at their ass not to say everybody is like that E3 there's some very cool people at E3 but at PAX everybody was awesome and developers are out there on the floor mingling with people like you know Loki played some game and I watched the people come up to him and say oh so did you like it and Loki was like you know yeah he was trying to be nice and give a positive answer and they they actually said what did you like about it what what what was cool about it to you I like they were asking for feedback

878
01:09:29,463 --> 01:09:32,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know that guy from Guitar Hero, and I apologize, I forgot his name.

879
01:09:32,705 --> 01:09:34,686
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have a business card to give me.

880
01:09:34,806 --> 01:09:38,668
[SPEAKER_03]: He talked to us for quite some time after the interview he did on All Games Radio.

881
01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:39,468
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very cool.

882
01:09:39,828 --> 01:09:44,211
[SPEAKER_05]: And he did confirm for me that there is no bonus peripheral for studio mode.

883
01:09:44,411 --> 01:09:44,871
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

884
01:09:46,112 --> 01:09:48,493
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was very cool.

885
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:49,213
[SPEAKER_03]: People were just hanging out.

886
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:52,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy from Warhammer Online was hilarious when we had him on the show.

887
01:09:52,415 --> 01:09:56,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I saw him later on the show floor, and he was just hanging out, chilling, showing off the game.

888
01:09:57,196 --> 01:09:59,137
[SPEAKER_03]: People are so much more laid back at PAX.

889
01:09:59,337 --> 01:10:02,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran into my DM again and he waved at me.

890
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:08,161
[SPEAKER_03]: If they put it on the floor at PAX, they realize the pictures are going to be all over the internet.

891
01:10:08,422 --> 01:10:14,184
[SPEAKER_03]: People have finally kind of gotten over it and they don't try to control it so much at PAX because they realize it's a gamer thing.

892
01:10:14,605 --> 01:10:18,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So if E3 is going to take that step, that's a big step for E3.

893
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:21,408
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are going to have to change their attitudes.

894
01:10:21,428 --> 01:10:21,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom.

895
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:25,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

896
01:10:25,836 --> 01:10:31,164
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I still didn't have, I think, quite the problem that you guys had at E3.

897
01:10:31,805 --> 01:10:39,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that, you know, a lot of it has to do with... I'm just saying, look who didn't go to PAX.

898
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:40,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

899
01:10:42,559 --> 01:10:45,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people can't handle it, I guess.

900
01:10:45,142 --> 01:10:46,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Pax is too cool.

901
01:10:47,364 --> 01:10:54,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we actually asked this question on our pre-OLR twit on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR at us on Twitter.

902
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,133
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been quite a few people to have this week, so thank you guys very much for that.

903
01:10:57,373 --> 01:11:01,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And we hope you enjoyed the updates from Jamie's iPhone at Penny Arcade Expo.

904
01:11:01,937 --> 01:11:07,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in charge of the... And sometimes the pictures didn't attach with the text I included, so oops.

905
01:11:07,783 --> 01:11:07,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

906
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:08,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

907
01:11:26,252 --> 01:11:27,493
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

908
01:11:48,072 --> 01:11:50,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of other expos are public, so why not?

909
01:11:50,213 --> 01:11:52,654
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you pay for a pass and follow the rules, fair game.

910
01:11:53,034 --> 01:11:54,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Quiltipo says, Capital idea.

911
01:11:54,915 --> 01:11:56,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always wanted to meet D-list celebrities.

912
01:11:57,456 --> 01:12:00,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember, E3 went under because of Paris Hilton and stuff.

913
01:12:00,257 --> 01:12:02,057
[SPEAKER_03]: But even PAX had their D-list celebrities.

914
01:12:02,437 --> 01:12:05,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, if you consider Jonathan Colton, Will Wheaton, Freeze Pop.

915
01:12:05,599 --> 01:12:07,799
[SPEAKER_05]: But we had cool people there.

916
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:08,640
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

917
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,841
[SPEAKER_03]: People that actually cater to the nerd crowds.

918
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:13,482
[SPEAKER_05]: We had people there who worked for their fame.

919
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,962
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, E3 did have Adam West.

920
01:12:16,803 --> 01:12:17,223
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair.

921
01:12:22,794 --> 01:12:26,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I want to point out, MistyOLR responded and said, Public?

922
01:12:26,436 --> 01:12:29,218
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean it wasn't public enough with all the loopholes that got exploited?

923
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,801
[SPEAKER_03]: She says, Bad idea, I think, especially with your report of the last E3 you went to.

924
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:39,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says, Considering the success of Penny Arcade Expo, I think they want to emulate that to redeem themselves.

925
01:12:39,785 --> 01:12:40,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I do hope they get it right, though.

926
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:43,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize if I managed to announce this name.

927
01:12:44,348 --> 01:12:45,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Giovedia?

928
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:47,330
[SPEAKER_03]: G-I-O-V-E-D-E-A?

929
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:48,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Giovedia?

930
01:12:49,622 --> 01:12:50,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my bad.

931
01:12:51,043 --> 01:12:55,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Says, bad idea for the whole time, but good idea to open it public for a day.

932
01:12:55,787 --> 01:12:57,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an industry expo, not a convention.

933
01:12:57,809 --> 01:13:02,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, that's something I've heard a lot, is make it more like Tokyo Game Show, where it's closed for one day, but open for the rest.

934
01:13:02,352 --> 01:13:03,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that would be fair.

935
01:13:03,653 --> 01:13:04,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a good conclusion.

936
01:13:05,795 --> 01:13:10,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And DR of War C, I think that might be Doctor of Warcraft or something like that?

937
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:10,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

938
01:13:10,538 --> 01:13:13,821
[SPEAKER_03]: DR of War C says, screw E3 going public.

939
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:15,622
[SPEAKER_03]: PAX is the new thing in town.

940
01:13:16,103 --> 01:13:18,585
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, it wouldn't hurt to have the two West Coast shows.

941
01:13:18,945 --> 01:13:20,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget E for No One.

942
01:13:21,307 --> 01:13:21,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, wait a minute.

943
01:13:21,787 --> 01:13:22,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to E for No One.

944
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:23,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

945
01:13:23,448 --> 01:13:24,509
[SPEAKER_03]: It might actually be kind of cool.

946
01:13:24,529 --> 01:13:25,469
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know what might happen.

947
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:32,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you want to get the pre-OLR twits and respond to a story before the show goes live, check us out on Twitter.

948
01:13:33,054 --> 01:13:33,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Our username?

949
01:13:33,934 --> 01:13:34,475
[SPEAKER_03]: OLR.

950
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:36,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Really hard to remember, I know.

951
01:13:37,182 --> 01:13:37,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Really difficult.

952
01:13:38,063 --> 01:13:42,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we are about to go to... Ranma says, you butcher Japanese and Italian.

953
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:43,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

954
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:48,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, foreign language was my one weakness in high school, if it's not completely obvious here on the show, okay?

955
01:13:49,156 --> 01:13:50,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you go.

956
01:13:50,518 --> 01:13:51,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Komo Te Lama.

957
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:52,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, uh...

958
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Sakura, what should all the kids be playing this week?

959
01:14:17,808 --> 01:14:23,533
[SPEAKER_05]: The game of the week is actually quite the obscure little title called Puzzle and Descent.

960
01:14:23,994 --> 01:14:36,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, um, also if you happen to find the name actually written in Japanese text, the first part of it's in Katakana and the last part's in, no, the first part's in Hiragana and the second part's in Katakana, which is very weird.

961
01:14:36,885 --> 01:14:42,631
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, it's a little puzzle game where you're this guy with a pointy hat who looks like a naked gnome.

962
01:14:45,576 --> 01:14:48,063
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Travelocity gnome with no pants.

963
01:14:49,269 --> 01:14:56,012
[SPEAKER_05]: The game itself plays sort of like a combination of Pango, Columns, and Bomberman.

964
01:14:56,893 --> 01:15:08,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And the publisher on this game, for those who actually keep up with putting that on the wiki, is Nichibutsu Nihon Busan.

965
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:11,200
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually released on April 14, 1995.

966
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:16,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And I almost bought a copy at PAX, but I didn't.

967
01:15:18,364 --> 01:15:24,948
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, the way that it works is you've got these four different colored blocks and you have to make all of them touch.

968
01:15:25,048 --> 01:15:29,671
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if three of them touch, then they vanish.

969
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:36,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And you may actually lose the entire puzzle in the time limit that you're given because you haven't made all the blocks vanish.

970
01:15:36,876 --> 01:15:47,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually, because it is that weird and obscure, I'm going to be linking one of the images into the chat room so that they can see what it's like.

971
01:15:49,344 --> 01:16:04,697
[SPEAKER_05]: and honestly if you can people are playing emulators just freaking download it already it's a really fun little game but keep in mind as you get further and further into the game it actually comes up a bit more like Super Silkeban if anyone's played that

972
01:16:05,257 --> 01:16:31,828
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have such a massive challenge on trying to get your blocks touching basically you have to shove them in position but as you go further you'll get some with percentage marks on them that are immobile you get ice blocks that will dissipate when they touch another object you have arrow blocks which you can only push in the direction that they're pointing you've also got a

973
01:16:33,129 --> 01:16:36,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Block, because you can actually play multiplayer.

974
01:16:36,754 --> 01:16:40,559
[SPEAKER_05]: You can block other people from making different moves.

975
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you've got teleport blocks that you can move them around.

976
01:16:46,347 --> 01:16:47,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just very...

977
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:51,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting little game.

978
01:16:51,915 --> 01:16:54,279
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets very, very challenging.

979
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:58,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's definitely one, if you like a game, that makes you think a little bit.

980
01:16:58,706 --> 01:17:02,712
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is only... You cannot play against the computer.

981
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:03,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only against...

982
01:17:04,054 --> 01:17:05,134
[SPEAKER_05]: and many more.

983
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:29,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I want to say I've played a game like this too, and I don't know what the hell it is.

984
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:32,200
[SPEAKER_03]: But it drove me nuts.

985
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:32,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.

986
01:17:32,921 --> 01:17:33,942
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a hard game.

987
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,765
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will put the name of it in the chat room so they can look it up.

988
01:17:37,806 --> 01:17:41,289
[SPEAKER_03]: or you can actually look at the same YouTube I'm looking at here, Puzzle and Desu.

989
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:42,089
[SPEAKER_03]: D-E-S-U.

990
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:43,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Very easy to spell.

991
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:43,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

992
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:45,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to put the name in.

993
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:49,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll link the, if you want to, since you've got it up, if you'll link that in the chat room.

994
01:17:49,514 --> 01:17:49,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

995
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:51,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's really fun.

996
01:17:51,415 --> 01:17:56,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, if you want to see these links as they show up, you've got to listen live to us on Sunday nights.

997
01:17:56,519 --> 01:18:03,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com to join our chat room and AllGames.com is where we're broadcasting every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific time.

998
01:18:03,603 --> 01:18:06,085
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Puzzle and Desu.

999
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:09,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Very simple game that will drive you nuts.

1000
01:18:10,403 --> 01:18:15,567
[SPEAKER_03]: No calls during Part A. I guess people don't like the whole, or they're just not used to it, the whole calls during the show thing.

1001
01:18:16,007 --> 01:18:18,730
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll just have to open it up at the end of B like usual.

1002
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So much for that experiment.

1003
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:21,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we'll try new things.

1004
01:18:21,892 --> 01:18:22,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Call us!

1005
01:18:22,973 --> 01:18:24,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I already shut it off for now.

1006
01:18:24,394 --> 01:18:36,623
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Colton, come back on Part B. No, we're already an hour 20 for Part A, so we gotta take a break so we can get to Part B. Alright, we'll get on Part B. Don't worry, we'll have time for calls in Part B. It's just folks are used to the end of the show.

1007
01:18:37,682 --> 01:18:38,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll do that.

1008
01:18:38,124 --> 01:18:39,248
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a quick break.

1009
01:18:39,288 --> 01:18:42,419
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back though with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after a quick break.

1010
01:18:42,519 --> 01:18:43,081
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you then.

1011
01:18:52,547 --> 01:18:57,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here from Orange Lounge Radio with an important message.

1012
01:18:58,232 --> 01:19:03,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Every year thousands of yellow wizards are about to die from a horrible outbreak, food shooting.

1013
01:19:04,518 --> 01:19:09,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Shooting food causes the loss of life in many red warriors and green elves across the planet.

1014
01:19:09,923 --> 01:19:14,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Elf needs food badly, so please think twice before shooting food this holiday season.

1015
01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:23,218
[SPEAKER_03]: The Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault.

1016
01:19:23,799 --> 01:19:26,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, don't shoot food.

1017
01:19:32,307 --> 01:19:35,651
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of other things I just tell you when I remember.

1018
01:19:36,473 --> 01:19:37,514
[SPEAKER_00]: He's crazy.

1019
01:19:37,754 --> 01:19:43,682
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could not see the similarities in the personalities within like the first couple of episodes, you need brain surgery.

1020
01:19:43,922 --> 01:19:44,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously.

1021
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:44,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Slap.

1022
01:19:49,229 --> 01:19:49,750
[SPEAKER_00]: How?

1023
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,672
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hit me so hard.

1024
01:19:51,692 --> 01:19:52,753
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that hard.

1025
01:19:52,873 --> 01:19:57,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your hosts DJ Ranma S and Kuro Usagi.

1026
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:03,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Log on to DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.

1027
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:09,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Gsteel, and I just wanna say that you are all losers for listening to video game quote, music.

1028
01:20:10,475 --> 01:20:13,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Music from video games is just a bunch of beeps and blips.

1029
01:20:13,738 --> 01:20:20,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand how people say music from say, Final Fantasy, Streets of Rage, or Maximum Twin's music.

1030
01:20:20,584 --> 01:20:23,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It's from video games and therefore talentless garbage.

1031
01:20:23,767 --> 01:20:26,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Using Koshiro and Nubo Uematsu can partake of my genitalia.

1032
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:30,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Video games' life can go to hell from making a big deal out of electronic beeps.

1033
01:20:31,374 --> 01:20:34,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Go listen to real music because music that has no tolerance needs to be banned.

1034
01:20:35,196 --> 01:20:35,996
[SPEAKER_08]: K-Things 5.

1035
01:20:36,477 --> 01:20:36,797
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

1036
01:20:37,097 --> 01:20:41,099
[SPEAKER_08]: This PSA is brought to you by La Milana, home of the never-ending Hell Temple music.

1037
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:43,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming Radio.

1038
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:48,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1039
01:20:49,023 --> 01:20:50,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1040
01:20:55,219 --> 01:21:12,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 7th, 2008 For our 293rd episode, if you can believe it There was a little boo-boo in the numbering of the podcast last week And some folks think they got episode 291 twice But no, it was just misnumbering, an error on my part Shoot me

1041
01:21:13,806 --> 01:21:15,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, don't shoot Rob.

1042
01:21:15,907 --> 01:21:16,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob is not food.

1043
01:21:17,768 --> 01:21:18,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Not with us tonight, of course.

1044
01:21:18,968 --> 01:21:21,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Techmaster Loki is out for the night, but that's okay.

1045
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:25,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It's DarkSakura and myself feeling the love, but just platonically.

1046
01:21:25,491 --> 01:21:25,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:21:26,171 --> 01:21:26,611

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gay.

1049
01:21:27,491 --> 01:21:27,771
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1050
01:21:28,572 --> 01:21:30,452
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are filling in as the co-hosts tonight.

1051
01:21:30,492 --> 01:21:34,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have some things you want to say.

1052
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:38,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks commenting on the various commercials there that were being played during the break.

1053
01:21:39,038 --> 01:21:40,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Having to recycle a little bit.

1054
01:21:40,219 --> 01:21:45,663
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have some promos that you want to have played during our free break, send them on in to us.

1055
01:21:46,123 --> 01:21:47,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob at OrangeLaundry.com.

1056
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:48,145
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send me an email.

1057
01:21:51,087 --> 01:21:56,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some gaming news this week with some news on the PSP.

1058
01:21:57,597 --> 01:21:59,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony PSP and PlayStation 3

1059
01:22:14,446 --> 01:22:15,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can do that.

1060
01:22:15,467 --> 01:22:19,749
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be happening this fall in Japan, but probably is going to inevitably happen over here as well.

1061
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:21,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if there's money to be made, why not?

1062
01:22:22,711 --> 01:22:26,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony, by the way, is also going to be launching a new infrastructure mode.

1063
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:30,075
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that happens when you connect the PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3.

1064
01:22:31,996 --> 01:22:53,099
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can do this all wirelessly and then what happens is that you can actually do some type of like multiplayer modes through a PlayStation 3 connection for some games so you kind of use your PlayStation 3 as like a hub to kind of do wireless stuff between the PSP which is kind of interesting could be interesting to see what they do with that but certainly there's been a lot of love between the PSP

1065
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:55,141
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation 3.

1066
01:22:55,521 --> 01:22:57,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very neat to see those two work together.

1067
01:22:58,284 --> 01:23:05,170
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, it seems like Nintendo's just catching up in that regard with the whole DS demos finally making their way to the Wii just a couple months ago.

1068
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:06,771
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been waiting.

1069
01:23:07,472 --> 01:23:08,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh, nice.

1070
01:23:09,544 --> 01:23:16,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you other things that we've been waiting for, at least people who are fangirls like me or fanboys not like me because I'm a girl.

1071
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:26,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we all knew that Kingdom Hearts was going to be a PlayStation 3 exclusive and there's going to be something about that at Tokyo Game Show.

1072
01:23:29,776 --> 01:23:31,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, really though, it's a rumor.

1073
01:23:33,081 --> 01:24:00,318
[SPEAKER_05]: but, you know, we won't know unless we hear something official from Tokyo Game Show but I honestly though, given that Kingdom Hearts has already been pretty much strictly well, except for the DS version which doesn't count but seeing that Sony's been pretty much sticking sorry, Squeenix has been sticking with Sony for this franchise for the most part I wouldn't be surprised if it's going to be a PS3 exclusive so, we'll see

1074
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,012
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1075
01:24:21,008 --> 01:24:21,489
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

1076
01:24:43,323 --> 01:24:43,964
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up with that?

1077
01:24:44,164 --> 01:24:45,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I go places without Dan.

1078
01:24:46,285 --> 01:24:48,447
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not too happy about it, but I do.

1079
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:49,868
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1080
01:24:50,529 --> 01:24:51,230
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1081
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to video games and the real world and so on.

1082
01:24:53,652 --> 01:24:54,532
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's cool.

1083
01:24:54,572 --> 01:24:55,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope he has fun wherever he goes.

1084
01:24:55,814 --> 01:24:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: But he better not miss another Sunday or he's so fired.

1085
01:24:58,196 --> 01:24:58,616
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

1086
01:24:59,016 --> 01:24:59,276
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1087
01:25:00,649 --> 01:25:03,150
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation Network games also going to be simulaunched in the UMD form

1088
01:25:24,922 --> 01:25:31,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe is actually going to be releasing collections of PlayStation Network titles that are going to be on UMD.

1089
01:25:31,807 --> 01:25:36,291
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Power Pack, which is going to have the games Flow, Syphon Filter, Combat Ops, and Beats.

1090
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:40,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Puzzle Pack will include Lemmings, Go Puzzle, and Go Sudoku.

1091
01:25:40,574 --> 01:25:49,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you that didn't feel like getting the games on the PlayStation 3, or you've still been too cheap to get a PlayStation 3, now you can get these on UMD for the PlayStation Portable, which I think is kind of interesting there.

1092
01:25:50,783 --> 01:25:51,784
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting that...

1093
01:25:52,364 --> 01:25:56,407
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still that cohesiveness between PlayStation 3 and PSP.

1094
01:25:56,467 --> 01:26:07,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of interesting that the titles are so... I know we joke a lot about the DS and the Wii getting a lot of the same ports, but I mean, for real, you're seeing the exact same games, exact same thing, going between the PSP and the PlayStation 3.

1095
01:26:08,236 --> 01:26:09,117
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting.

1096
01:26:09,657 --> 01:26:11,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll be able to check that out in Europe.

1097
01:26:12,139 --> 01:26:17,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I imagine if it sells well over there, it's probably only a matter of time before that stuff comes out over here.

1098
01:26:17,563 --> 01:26:19,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, where there's money to be made, right?

1099
01:26:19,865 --> 01:26:20,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

1100
01:26:21,412 --> 01:26:21,733
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1101
01:26:21,873 --> 01:26:24,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's pretty much the way that it works, isn't it?

1102
01:26:25,455 --> 01:26:28,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at any rate, we do have some other news.

1103
01:26:29,498 --> 01:26:34,342
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have some information about a little big planet.

1104
01:26:34,362 --> 01:26:37,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be having a limited public beta this month.

1105
01:26:38,164 --> 01:26:39,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's pretty cool.

1106
01:26:41,147 --> 01:26:45,730
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no other details about it, but they said you'll be able to sign up for it.

1107
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:51,655
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't say how or when or well, but it will be made public right before the test is to be launched.

1108
01:26:52,335 --> 01:26:55,177
[SPEAKER_05]: They also do have an invite-only method.

1109
01:26:56,518 --> 01:26:59,381
[SPEAKER_05]: But they said they'll be large enough that people around the world will be able to have fun with it.

1110
01:26:59,401 --> 01:27:00,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like a Gmail thing?

1111
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:02,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when Gmail invites were very rare?

1112
01:27:02,683 --> 01:27:03,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Or wait, no, no, no, LiveJournal.

1113
01:27:04,004 --> 01:27:06,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when you got one invite code for LiveJournal?

1114
01:27:06,786 --> 01:27:07,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1115
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:07,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

1116
01:27:08,095 --> 01:27:09,076
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1117
01:27:37,765 --> 01:27:38,065
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Max DJ Max

1118
01:28:03,206 --> 01:28:05,009
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Max Games coming out.

1119
01:28:05,049 --> 01:28:08,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Pentavision has announced they are coming out with two new titles.

1120
01:28:09,454 --> 01:28:14,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me for horribly mispronouncing these names, but there's Klaziquil Edition and Black Square.

1121
01:28:14,841 --> 01:28:15,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I got that one right.

1122
01:28:16,303 --> 01:28:19,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Pentavision is actually going after both the hardcore and the casual gamers.

1123
01:28:20,669 --> 01:28:21,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really...

1124
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:22,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1125
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:41,301
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackSquare

1126
01:28:58,439 --> 01:28:58,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1127
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:04,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks in chat room are definitely feeling pretty hardcore about this.

1128
01:29:04,683 --> 01:29:07,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Gsquared68 is a fan of the game and says, Wait, what?

1129
01:29:07,424 --> 01:29:08,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're probably just limited editions.

1130
01:29:09,085 --> 01:29:12,047
[SPEAKER_03]: They need a feature that tracks percentage and not just score.

1131
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:15,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Scoring system equals combo based equals epic fail.

1132
01:29:16,069 --> 01:29:17,890
[SPEAKER_03]: But Actdeft says, Yay, DJ Max.

1133
01:29:19,451 --> 01:29:19,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1134
01:29:21,175 --> 01:29:38,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in other PlayStation news, and this should make some of our European listeners happy, is that there will be randomly selected PS3 owners in Europe who will be able to get the demo of Motorstorm Pacific Rift, which was only exclusive to the U.S.

1135
01:29:39,045 --> 01:29:41,947
[SPEAKER_05]: for people who bought copies of Core on PSN.

1136
01:29:43,207 --> 01:29:44,068
[SPEAKER_05]: For any of...

1137
01:29:46,438 --> 01:30:03,482
[SPEAKER_05]: The, uh, basically for any of the players in Europe who also, I do believe, purchased the game, it will be available, and it's supposed to include the Airzone track, so you can give it a try, and it has support for single player and two player split screen, so it'd be cool.

1138
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:08,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, it's supposed to be free for a few days before the official release.

1139
01:30:09,758 --> 01:30:10,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Motorstorm 2 is very pretty.

1140
01:30:11,218 --> 01:30:16,119
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very popular demo, so I didn't get to get my hands on it, but it looked very pretty from what I noticed.

1141
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:19,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the jungle scape much more than the dirt of the first one.

1142
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:25,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the jungle was a much better setting for the game, although I would like to see, I don't know if it's too much to ask for a game with a little more diversity.

1143
01:30:26,321 --> 01:30:27,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us some jungle and some dirt.

1144
01:30:27,842 --> 01:30:28,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the great racing games.

1145
01:30:29,002 --> 01:30:30,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Excite Truck did that.

1146
01:30:30,922 --> 01:30:31,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirt.

1147
01:30:32,042 --> 01:30:32,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1148
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:36,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what game you get to experience all over again.

1149
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:39,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,

1150
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:46,653
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, all over again.

1151
01:30:46,793 --> 01:30:53,242
[SPEAKER_03]: As if the PC wasn't enough, and the PSP wasn't enough, and the Xbox 360 wasn't enough.

1152
01:30:54,605 --> 01:30:58,907
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to get Shinin' and Luminous, and your mobile phones weren't enough.

1153
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,869
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to do this all over again on the PlayStation Network.

1154
01:31:02,909 --> 01:31:11,354
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, Luminous Supernova was announced for the PlayStation Network this week, and it is the same game you know and love, but with some new stuff.

1155
01:31:11,374 --> 01:31:15,135
[SPEAKER_03]: You know there's going to be some new skins, some new songs, and some new modes.

1156
01:31:15,176 --> 01:31:16,816
[SPEAKER_03]: They've announced Dig Down mode.

1157
01:31:17,357 --> 01:31:21,979
[SPEAKER_03]: You use the falling blocks to erase squares from the playfield that already has blocks on it.

1158
01:31:22,299 --> 01:31:22,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Driller!

1159
01:31:22,599 --> 01:31:22,699
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1160
01:31:22,739 --> 01:31:23,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm joking.

1161
01:31:45,444 --> 01:31:46,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Spice World was a crabby game

1162
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:05,113
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

1163
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:08,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Supernova, 40 unlockable skins in challenge mode.

1164
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:13,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, of course, skin edit, time attack, puzzle mission modes, two-player versus mode.

1165
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:25,031
[SPEAKER_03]: No release date set yet, and it's not known if it's going to take the microtransaction approach that made this game so controversial on the Xbox 360, where you only buy the base game and then have to buy everything separate.

1166
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:26,512
[SPEAKER_03]: My gut tells me no.

1167
01:32:27,193 --> 01:32:27,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Ness?

1168
01:32:27,693 --> 01:32:28,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Ness?

1169
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:53,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not net, it's Earthbound-like.

1170
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:57,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I only say that because it's a little kid wearing a baseball cap, so it reminds me of that.

1171
01:32:57,811 --> 01:32:58,352
[SPEAKER_03]: But there you have it.

1172
01:32:59,472 --> 01:33:01,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.

1173
01:33:02,973 --> 01:33:08,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of not interested because whatever they put in this game will be recycled into Luminous 3, which I'm sure is inevitable.

1174
01:33:08,934 --> 01:33:11,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they'll release this yet another microtransaction for Xbox Live Arcade, I bet.

1175
01:33:12,475 --> 01:33:14,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, the well mode doesn't sound that interesting.

1176
01:33:15,016 --> 01:33:16,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Sequencer mode sounds okay.

1177
01:33:16,696 --> 01:33:18,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like it better if you could use your own songs.

1178
01:33:19,857 --> 01:33:21,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, someday, maybe.

1179
01:33:21,633 --> 01:33:21,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1180
01:33:22,953 --> 01:33:40,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well every week here on Orange Lounge Radio we allow you guys to interact with us, not just through the chat room and the phone calls, but your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and every week DarkSakura digs into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite emails and reads them for you live here on Orange Lounge Radio and I'm sure the email's been collecting as we were away at PAX.

1181
01:33:41,317 --> 01:33:41,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Kinda.

1182
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:42,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get to it.

1183
01:33:42,837 --> 01:33:45,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if she has time to read them all, but she'll at least do some of her favorites tonight.

1184
01:33:46,498 --> 01:33:47,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I can read most of them.

1185
01:33:48,759 --> 01:33:53,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey OLR, ever since 2006, I was very excited for the Wii since it came out.

1186
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I purchased one early 2007.

1187
01:33:55,741 --> 01:33:57,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to work to pay it off all summer.

1188
01:33:58,582 --> 01:34:02,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought all the big Nintendo titles and played each of them for about 20 hours until I got stuck.

1189
01:34:03,223 --> 01:34:04,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I got an Xbox 360.

1190
01:34:04,664 --> 01:34:05,664
[SPEAKER_05]: They are incomparable.

1191
01:34:06,065 --> 01:34:09,507
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox 360 has good online experience and great high-definition graphics.

1192
01:34:09,967 --> 01:34:13,809
[SPEAKER_05]: After watching Nintendo's press conference, I have completely lost hope.

1193
01:34:14,309 --> 01:34:16,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, Nintendo doesn't need to do anything for us.

1194
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:24,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Long story short, my Wii is ending today on eBay, and I'm hoping to get a lot from it, seeing as how it still is in demand.

1195
01:34:25,316 --> 01:34:27,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts.

1196
01:34:27,557 --> 01:34:28,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is spelled H-E-A-R...

1197
01:34:30,058 --> 01:34:31,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Here are your thoughts on this.

1198
01:34:31,219 --> 01:34:32,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Love your show, keep it up.

1199
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,821
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, my name is Dan and my gamer tag is DanThe3rd.

1200
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:36,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you have a good name.

1201
01:34:39,323 --> 01:34:40,524
[SPEAKER_05]: That's up to you.

1202
01:34:40,584 --> 01:34:41,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not getting rid of my Wii.

1203
01:34:41,984 --> 01:34:43,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have stuff on that that I like to play.

1204
01:34:44,606 --> 01:34:46,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff on 360 I like to play.

1205
01:34:48,147 --> 01:34:50,869
[SPEAKER_05]: It just really depends on what type of things that you like.

1206
01:34:50,989 --> 01:34:53,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's stuff on PS3 that I like to play.

1207
01:34:54,611 --> 01:34:54,671
[SPEAKER_05]: It...

1208
01:34:55,267 --> 01:35:01,734
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's been a little while since we've reiterated the golden rule of gaming for our listeners, so why don't we remind the listeners of what the golden rule of gaming is.

1209
01:35:01,915 --> 01:35:04,498
[SPEAKER_05]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1210
01:35:05,971 --> 01:35:06,812
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1211
01:35:29,249 --> 01:35:33,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to hang on to my Wii because I want to try it out because it might actually be pretty cool with the internet in the room speak thing.

1212
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:34,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1213
01:35:35,231 --> 01:35:35,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Time will tell.

1214
01:35:36,811 --> 01:35:46,053
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wouldn't know if I sold my Wii back in a panic and they might be even harder to get when you want them again or you might think you make a profit off it now but it's a risky game.

1215
01:35:46,353 --> 01:35:47,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a risky game to play.

1216
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:53,975
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, if you're not enjoying your Wii and you're never playing your Wii and you don't think there's anything in the future, then sell it.

1217
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:55,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other family probably really wants it.

1218
01:35:55,976 --> 01:35:56,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1219
01:35:57,176 --> 01:36:00,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Make some money off it, but realize I've seen people do this.

1220
01:36:00,579 --> 01:36:06,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I've even seen a good friend of mine do this where he'll get a system, sell it back, buy the same system six months later, sell it back, buy it again.

1221
01:36:06,966 --> 01:36:08,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of like, what are you thinking?

1222
01:36:08,167 --> 01:36:10,469
[SPEAKER_03]: You're losing so much money doing that.

1223
01:36:10,549 --> 01:36:14,693
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think something's going to come out on it that you want to play in the future, hang on to it.

1224
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:16,475
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll save money in the long run.

1225
01:36:18,143 --> 01:36:21,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email up, and this is regarding Evangelion, actually.

1226
01:36:21,184 --> 01:36:25,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I have a friend that is obsessed with Evangelion, and I was wondering if there are any good games from that series.

1227
01:36:26,005 --> 01:36:26,765
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer is no.

1228
01:36:27,785 --> 01:36:33,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you like playing the dating sim kind, and then I've got, there was, you know, the Saturn ones that came out.

1229
01:36:33,887 --> 01:36:41,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was one on Nintendo 64, and there most recently came out one, I want to say on PS2, was it?

1230
01:36:42,748 --> 01:36:43,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't seek out these games.

1231
01:36:43,809 --> 01:36:46,751
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still making Eva games, so just look online.

1232
01:36:46,771 --> 01:36:48,012
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pachinko game is the best one.

1233
01:36:48,572 --> 01:36:48,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for that.

1234
01:36:49,072 --> 01:36:52,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, he says he is learning Japanese, so importing is not a problem.

1235
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:53,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1236
01:36:54,356 --> 01:36:57,778
[SPEAKER_05]: If it has that crazy intro theme from the anime, it gets bonus points.

1237
01:36:58,899 --> 01:36:59,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, they all do.

1238
01:36:59,659 --> 01:37:00,100
[SPEAKER_05]: They all do.

1239
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:07,184
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I can tell you from experience that at least one of the Saturn ones has a full opening like it was an episode.

1240
01:37:07,865 --> 01:37:09,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It's set up like an episode, basically.

1241
01:37:11,806 --> 01:37:15,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I would make him ask for himself, but I'm still working on converting him to OLR goodness.

1242
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:17,012
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys and Gal are great.

1243
01:37:17,532 --> 01:37:21,196
[SPEAKER_05]: You're funny, kicks my brain, and I enjoy it every week via podcast.

1244
01:37:21,236 --> 01:37:22,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday I will listen live.

1245
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:23,799
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not a threat, it's a promise.

1246
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:25,000
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1247
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,562
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, why do you hate Ayanami?

1248
01:37:27,002 --> 01:37:30,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she's boring and has the personality of a bedsheet.

1249
01:37:31,787 --> 01:37:33,068
[SPEAKER_05]: and Asuka could kick her ass.

1250
01:37:33,288 --> 01:37:34,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea what you're talking about, but it's funny.

1251
01:37:35,609 --> 01:37:37,710
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a clone girl with no personality.

1252
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:38,710
[SPEAKER_05]: PPS.

1253
01:37:39,351 --> 01:37:40,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope I avoided the grammar attack.

1254
01:37:40,992 --> 01:37:41,692
[SPEAKER_05]: That was scary.

1255
01:37:43,273 --> 01:37:43,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

1256
01:37:48,294 --> 01:37:49,834
[SPEAKER_03]: You did okay.

1257
01:37:50,135 --> 01:37:52,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me distract the Grammar Nazi, DarkSakura, with some chat comments.

1258
01:37:52,895 --> 01:37:59,397
[SPEAKER_03]: The last email generated a lot of chat comments talking about the kids wanting to sell back his Wii.

1259
01:37:59,437 --> 01:38:02,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylark in chat says, Fuck my Wii.

1260
01:38:02,318 --> 01:38:03,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it in four months.

1261
01:38:03,718 --> 01:38:04,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't sell it, though.

1262
01:38:04,598 --> 01:38:05,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Spent $300 on virtual console.

1263
01:38:08,385 --> 01:38:11,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, I've probably bought a lot on that too.

1264
01:38:11,847 --> 01:38:14,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylark also continues to say, only good for a party environment.

1265
01:38:14,748 --> 01:38:16,689
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD says, some other family wants it.

1266
01:38:16,769 --> 01:38:17,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of the children.

1267
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:19,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Sell your Wii.

1268
01:38:20,351 --> 01:38:22,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anyone thinking of the children?

1269
01:38:22,873 --> 01:38:26,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft would like to point out that bed sheets are warm and sometimes comfy.

1270
01:38:26,635 --> 01:38:28,256
[SPEAKER_05]: That's only when worn by other bodies.

1271
01:38:30,777 --> 01:38:34,299
[SPEAKER_05]: She has the personality of a stalactite.

1272
01:38:38,188 --> 01:38:41,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Xenovore, Yes I Eat Aliens, Munch Munch, Crunch Crunch, Slurp Gulp Happy

1273
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:56,292
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura++

1274
01:39:11,323 --> 01:39:11,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

1275
01:39:12,824 --> 01:39:13,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email.

1276
01:39:15,565 --> 01:39:19,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's time to check how the Eye of Judgment is doing in sales, don't you?

1277
01:39:19,766 --> 01:39:22,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen to you guys to put me to sleep.

1278
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:24,948
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're not that boring.

1279
01:39:24,968 --> 01:39:25,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, wait a minute.

1280
01:39:25,688 --> 01:39:26,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me finish.

1281
01:39:26,408 --> 01:39:27,149
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're not that boring.

1282
01:39:27,189 --> 01:39:28,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just more entertaining than music.

1283
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:31,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have not heard anything on the Eye of Judgment.

1284
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:33,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just me or did you forget?

1285
01:39:33,751 --> 01:39:35,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely yours, Richard, a.k.a.

1286
01:39:35,212 --> 01:39:36,312
[SPEAKER_05]: The Doctor, a.k.a.

1287
01:39:36,552 --> 01:39:38,133
[SPEAKER_05]: XGC The Doctor, a.k.a.

1288
01:39:38,173 --> 01:39:38,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That One Guy.

1289
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:42,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1290
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:45,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, it's not going to sell a million.

1291
01:39:45,321 --> 01:39:49,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to break it to you, but I will look up the numbers right now while DarkSakura reads the next email.

1292
01:39:50,384 --> 01:39:51,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR.

1293
01:39:51,304 --> 01:39:52,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Tybon here from Kenya.

1294
01:39:53,106 --> 01:39:56,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been able to take a picture of Samara's Cafe yet, but the pic is coming.

1295
01:39:57,128 --> 01:40:02,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally bought a Nintendo DS, so I'm looking for some recommendations on some RPGs I should import for the system.

1296
01:40:03,312 --> 01:40:06,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry for the shortness of my email, but I'm typing this out on my iPhone.

1297
01:40:06,534 --> 01:40:08,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the read on your show, Tybon...

1298
01:40:10,336 --> 01:40:10,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't pronounce it.

1299
01:40:10,936 --> 01:40:13,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, how are those iPhone sales doing in Kenya?

1300
01:40:13,517 --> 01:40:14,937
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all over the place.

1301
01:40:15,497 --> 01:40:18,358
[SPEAKER_05]: This message is brought to you by Kenya, home of the never-ending mud walls.

1302
01:40:18,778 --> 01:40:19,058
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1303
01:40:19,078 --> 01:40:20,358
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't my email address.

1304
01:40:20,398 --> 01:40:21,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I was banned from Gmail.

1305
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:23,839
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get banned from Gmail.

1306
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:25,779
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy is following me on Twitter.

1307
01:40:25,879 --> 01:40:26,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lie.

1308
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:27,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Admit why you are lying.

1309
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you do this?

1310
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's funny.

1311
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:32,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

1312
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:34,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the world ends with you.

1313
01:40:35,097 --> 01:40:36,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I have judgment.

1314
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:36,699
220,000.

1315
01:40:38,601 --> 01:40:39,021
[SPEAKER_03]: 22 million.

1316
01:40:39,061 --> 01:40:41,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're just over one-fifth of the way there.

1317
01:40:42,145 --> 01:40:43,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy VI.

1318
01:40:43,887 --> 01:40:47,611
[SPEAKER_05]: And then watch out for the Kenyans because they run really fast, according to that one commercial.

1319
01:40:48,472 --> 01:40:49,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, next email.

1320
01:40:50,894 --> 01:40:51,694
[SPEAKER_05]: How goes it?

1321
01:40:51,914 --> 01:40:52,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes.

1322
01:40:52,995 --> 01:40:57,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I tried to make some sense when typing, but I'm horrid with punctuation and grammar in general.

1323
01:40:58,237 --> 01:40:58,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

1324
01:40:59,117 --> 01:41:01,719
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something... This is the one that I sort of savaged before.

1325
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:08,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something I really picked up on and was in trouble a lot as a kid when you were supposed to learn all that stuff.

1326
01:41:08,601 --> 01:41:10,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that being said, it's me, Glider, a.k.a.

1327
01:41:10,802 --> 01:41:13,263
[SPEAKER_05]: the 56K-er, just had a few things to mention.

1328
01:41:13,703 --> 01:41:15,564
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit pissed about digital life this year.

1329
01:41:15,604 --> 01:41:19,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been going to the... For the past few years, gonna miss it this year, but oh well.

1330
01:41:20,186 --> 01:41:25,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Jet Set Radio, one of my personal faves, another unusual skating game that was on PlayStation 2, Yaya Cabalista.

1331
01:41:26,811 --> 01:41:27,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, City Skater.

1332
01:41:28,312 --> 01:41:31,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the crap out of it and was good very close to Jet Set Radio.

1333
01:41:31,914 --> 01:41:35,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It could use a little skateboard that you put on an analog stick and held the controller sideways.

1334
01:41:35,416 --> 01:41:37,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Very painful on the thumbs, but nonetheless fun.

1335
01:41:37,698 --> 01:41:40,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really good at reading run-in sentences, aren't I?

1336
01:41:43,261 --> 01:41:44,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I remember what else I was going to say.

1337
01:41:45,023 --> 01:41:45,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob!

1338
01:41:45,443 --> 01:41:45,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob!

1339
01:41:47,051 --> 01:41:50,054
[SPEAKER_05]: He put it all in caps, so I had to say it that way.

1340
01:41:50,254 --> 01:41:52,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard you crack the dial-up joke.

1341
01:41:52,556 --> 01:42:01,724
[SPEAKER_05]: The 56k has been my handle for almost 15 years now, so I'm not giving it up, even though I do have high-speed broadband 20 megabytes down and 8 megabytes up.

1342
01:42:02,105 --> 01:42:05,948
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about average these days.

1343
01:42:06,068 --> 01:42:11,533
[SPEAKER_05]: But real quick, I did used to use shotgun to 56k modems, you know, sync them and dial out.

1344
01:42:11,793 --> 01:42:14,074
[SPEAKER_05]: to different services with the same login.

1345
01:42:14,394 --> 01:42:17,515
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also a good way to blow out your MOBO and modems.

1346
01:42:18,095 --> 01:42:19,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, at least you're not the 300 bodder.

1347
01:42:19,636 --> 01:42:24,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, because when I was on the Commodore 64 back in the day calling BBSs, 300 bod, yo.

1348
01:42:24,418 --> 01:42:24,558
[SPEAKER_03]: 300 bod.

1349
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:29,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, keep up the good work.

1350
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Catch you guys later.

1351
01:42:30,121 --> 01:42:30,481
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1352
01:42:30,521 --> 01:42:33,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, I'm really trying to have better grammar and punctuation.

1353
01:42:33,181 --> 01:42:34,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please don't eat me.

1354
01:42:34,742 --> 01:42:35,282
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1355
01:42:37,463 --> 01:42:41,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Just remember that when your sentence ends, use a period.

1356
01:42:42,384 --> 01:42:45,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you're excited, use an exclamation point.

1357
01:42:45,505 --> 01:42:48,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you're asking a question, you use a question mark.

1358
01:42:49,526 --> 01:42:52,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you start your new sentence, you use the big letters.

1359
01:42:53,578 --> 01:42:56,784
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, that 300 baud modem, about the size of a Neo Geo cartridge.

1360
01:42:57,085 --> 01:42:57,366
[SPEAKER_03]: No joke.

1361
01:42:57,406 --> 01:42:57,787
[SPEAKER_05]: God, really?

1362
01:42:57,847 --> 01:42:58,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1363
01:42:58,909 --> 01:42:59,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email!

1364
01:42:59,831 --> 01:43:00,412
[SPEAKER_05]: We have three left.

1365
01:43:00,893 --> 01:43:02,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, this is- Three!

1366
01:43:03,939 --> 01:43:04,380
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1367
01:43:04,881 --> 01:43:05,121
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1368
01:43:05,882 --> 01:43:06,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's fine.

1369
01:43:06,882 --> 01:43:08,583
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a lot of stories left, so this fills time.

1370
01:43:08,603 --> 01:43:09,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, this is Blade 3.

1371
01:43:10,204 --> 01:43:14,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say I'm a long-time listener and I've never called in, but I'm going to try this weekend.

1372
01:43:14,746 --> 01:43:15,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please do.

1373
01:43:16,067 --> 01:43:19,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I wanted to ask your opinion about Counter-Strike Source and Knights of the Old Republic.

1374
01:43:19,809 --> 01:43:20,469
[SPEAKER_05]: KOTOR!

1375
01:43:21,129 --> 01:43:21,730
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've played them.

1376
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:23,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about my bad grammar.

1377
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:23,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm using my PSP.

1378
01:43:23,991 --> 01:43:24,371
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

1379
01:43:24,391 --> 01:43:25,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Yours are still better than the last email.

1380
01:43:26,332 --> 01:43:29,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I also wanted to tell Loki that I'm very impressed with the PSPOLR site.

1381
01:43:30,273 --> 01:43:31,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It is so good.

1382
01:43:31,653 --> 01:43:35,754
[SPEAKER_05]: On that note, I would like to ask his permission to use the source code for my own PSP site.

1383
01:43:36,074 --> 01:43:40,635
[SPEAKER_05]: The name and images and links and stuff would be different, but I'm having trouble with formatting, so it would be handy.

1384
01:43:40,755 --> 01:43:41,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1385
01:43:41,596 --> 01:43:42,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Good show as always.

1386
01:43:42,656 --> 01:43:43,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it up.

1387
01:43:43,276 --> 01:43:43,616
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1388
01:43:43,696 --> 01:43:48,177
[SPEAKER_05]: My site would be primarily used for PSP downloads such as videos, wallpapers, and demos directly to the PSP.

1389
01:43:48,517 --> 01:43:51,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Loki is not here to answer that question, so you'll have to ask him later.

1390
01:43:52,179 --> 01:43:53,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and he left chat.

1391
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:54,461
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always email him, though.

1392
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:56,383
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes getting emails.

1393
01:43:56,403 --> 01:43:58,045
[SPEAKER_05]: He loves email.

1394
01:43:58,065 --> 01:43:58,686
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them.

1395
01:43:59,247 --> 01:44:01,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially email about My Little Pony.

1396
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:04,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you sign him up for porn mail lists, he'll love that.

1397
01:44:04,492 --> 01:44:05,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he loves it so much.

1398
01:44:05,714 --> 01:44:06,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so much fun.

1399
01:44:06,775 --> 01:44:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we shouldn't be encouraging folks to do that because our website administrator probably would frown on that.

1400
01:44:11,097 --> 01:44:12,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, don't actually do that.

1401
01:44:12,298 --> 01:44:13,359
[SPEAKER_05]: He was in his big frowny faces.

1402
01:44:13,959 --> 01:44:15,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, as far as Kotor, I'm sorry.

1403
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:20,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a friend who used to playtest that, and I got too used to hearing her calling it Skrotor.

1404
01:44:20,903 --> 01:44:26,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have no ideas about the name, except I've been watching Udon Kru's art that they've been putting up on DeviantArt, and it looks pretty cool.

1405
01:44:27,785 --> 01:44:31,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I have no opinion on the game, I mean, KOTOR's okay from what I've seen of it.

1406
01:44:31,168 --> 01:44:32,529
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the other one, Counter-Strike?

1407
01:44:32,769 --> 01:44:33,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Counter-Strike, Source.

1408
01:44:33,630 --> 01:44:35,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my type of game, but Loki.

1409
01:44:35,411 --> 01:44:37,973
[SPEAKER_03]: See, it's a bummer Loki wasn't here because he really plays that.

1410
01:44:38,233 --> 01:44:40,235
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I don't really play the game, I turn to chat.

1411
01:44:40,755 --> 01:44:42,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob D says, Source was just fun.

1412
01:44:43,077 --> 01:44:47,080
[SPEAKER_03]: KOTOR was revolutionary for Star Wars games and revitalized them for a little while.

1413
01:44:48,422 --> 01:44:48,862
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

1414
01:44:50,669 --> 01:44:53,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kept hearing about, this game is buggy!

1415
01:44:53,552 --> 01:44:54,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate this glitch!

1416
01:44:55,033 --> 01:44:56,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of my friend, you.

1417
01:44:56,935 --> 01:45:01,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, I would like to comment on a story topic you folks talked about on your last show.

1418
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:05,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have called in then, but your 800 number was down at the time.

1419
01:45:05,703 --> 01:45:15,090
[SPEAKER_05]: In regards to the story about the reworked Space Invaders game that was done for art slash commentary purposes, I feel pretty much as Jamie does.

1420
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:16,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I know because I'm right all the time.

1421
01:45:17,272 --> 01:45:20,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just like to add my own two cents in the form of two rhetorical questions.

1422
01:45:21,335 --> 01:45:24,957
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how the First Amendment to our Bill of Rights guarantees us the right to free speech?

1423
01:45:25,318 --> 01:45:27,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what amendment guarantees the right to not be offended?

1424
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:29,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, there isn't one.

1425
01:45:30,001 --> 01:45:34,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, the whiny little fucker that was pissing and moaning about this issue really needs to get a grip.

1426
01:45:34,884 --> 01:45:45,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only that, but if I was in the guy's shoes and the guys that did the exhibit, I probably would not have only kept the exhibit up, I would have most likely cobbled something together as a response to the whining.

1427
01:45:46,051 --> 01:45:55,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, something along the lines of the player actually bringing the terrorists flying planes into Twin Towers but changed the plane into a flying pair of boobs or some phallic symbol instead of a plane.

1428
01:45:55,317 --> 01:45:57,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of y'all are just vindictive like that.

1429
01:45:58,859 --> 01:46:04,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus add a severed head, rampant cursing, a straight couple having sex, and two men kissing.

1430
01:46:04,823 --> 01:46:07,244
[SPEAKER_05]: All of this would be a roundabout way of saying fuck you to the whiners.

1431
01:46:08,365 --> 01:46:11,267
[SPEAKER_05]: One more thing that relates to this that I just remembered.

1432
01:46:11,327 --> 01:46:16,951
[SPEAKER_05]: The original intention of free speech in the First Amendment was to protect the voice opinions...

1433
01:46:17,831 --> 01:46:20,512
[SPEAKER_05]: of those whom are in a minority in a given issue.

1434
01:46:20,972 --> 01:46:27,715
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't mean like race or anything, but I mean like those people who have unpopular views like the KKK, people who think Bin Laden is cool, etc.

1435
01:46:28,055 --> 01:46:31,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Face it, not everyone has the same views slash opinions, etc.

1436
01:46:31,536 --> 01:46:32,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for reading this.

1437
01:46:32,557 --> 01:46:33,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

1438
01:46:33,962 --> 01:46:36,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, that's perfectly right.

1439
01:46:36,383 --> 01:46:49,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody, no matter how offensive or distasteful their opinions are, as long as they are a citizen or at least legally living within this country, they do have a right to voice that opinion.

1440
01:46:50,046 --> 01:46:52,627
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they do so in...

1441
01:46:55,447 --> 01:46:56,207
[SPEAKER_05]: An appropriate way.

1442
01:46:56,447 --> 01:46:57,267
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1443
01:46:58,188 --> 01:47:02,368
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some places, especially private ground, where people are not going to allow some people to say things.

1444
01:47:02,768 --> 01:47:09,130
[SPEAKER_05]: A private organization may not let somebody from an outside source say something on their property.

1445
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:14,251
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the United States, we do have freedom of speech, even if it is unpopular and people are wrong.

1446
01:47:16,631 --> 01:47:17,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's got a right to have an opinion.

1447
01:47:18,792 --> 01:47:22,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to really think for a minute what that email was even about because it's been so long.

1448
01:47:22,512 --> 01:47:24,593
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like two weeks ever since Penny Arcade Expo.

1449
01:47:24,633 --> 01:47:25,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Email Rob.

1450
01:47:25,862 --> 01:47:28,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not giving out the source code for the site.

1451
01:47:28,244 --> 01:47:28,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

1452
01:47:44,238 --> 01:47:45,658
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, he did work really hard on it.

1453
01:47:45,678 --> 01:47:46,159
[SPEAKER_03]: He did earn it.

1454
01:47:46,819 --> 01:47:47,639
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do want to say this.

1455
01:47:47,699 --> 01:47:52,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you could get Loki that chat thing he's been looking for, that other guy won't give up, maybe he'll make a trade.

1456
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:53,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1457
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:54,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just hypothesizing.

1458
01:47:54,821 --> 01:47:59,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki does go on to say, I've never played Counter-Strike, and no prawn email, please.

1459
01:47:59,042 --> 01:48:00,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I get enough spam in my OLR email.

1460
01:48:01,483 --> 01:48:01,943
[SPEAKER_03]: He's lying.

1461
01:48:01,983 --> 01:48:02,643
[SPEAKER_03]: He loves the porn.

1462
01:48:03,103 --> 01:48:03,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

1463
01:48:04,783 --> 01:48:05,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Last email?

1464
01:48:05,664 --> 01:48:05,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

1465
01:48:06,024 --> 01:48:08,384
[SPEAKER_03]: We all get a lot of spam in our Orange Launch Radio boxes.

1466
01:48:08,404 --> 01:48:09,585
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I deleted mine.

1467
01:48:09,705 --> 01:48:10,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerks.

1468
01:48:11,004 --> 01:48:11,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, yeah, this.

1469
01:48:11,824 --> 01:48:12,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Last email, please.

1470
01:48:12,765 --> 01:48:13,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1471
01:48:13,205 --> 01:48:18,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, I would like to comment on a story slash topic you folks have talked about on your last show.

1472
01:48:19,389 --> 01:48:20,489
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no comment at all.

1473
01:48:21,050 --> 01:48:21,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I just read this one.

1474
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:22,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you?

1475
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:22,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1476
01:48:22,550 --> 01:48:23,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, boo.

1477
01:48:23,851 --> 01:48:26,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey OLR, are you having a super special awesome Sunday?

1478
01:48:26,913 --> 01:48:28,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies for those who know the reference.

1479
01:48:29,014 --> 01:48:39,483
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, I was downloading some old podcasts from the OL Archive when you guys were away for a week, and I can safely say that you have been a really great podcast throughout the years.

1480
01:48:39,863 --> 01:48:44,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funny comparing your old expectations from the next-gen consoles and your usual antics.

1481
01:48:45,307 --> 01:48:48,870
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, DMN, Elebits is not a Katamari killer minus episode 200, sorry.

1482
01:48:51,212 --> 01:48:56,036
[SPEAKER_05]: To finish, I was at Blockbuster today and saw copies of DDRX and DDR Hottest Party 2 bundles.

1483
01:48:56,517 --> 01:49:01,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the release date is September 16th for both games, can retail stores sell the games beforehand?

1484
01:49:02,182 --> 01:49:02,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Not technically.

1485
01:49:03,363 --> 01:49:05,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Or does it really apply to street dates?

1486
01:49:05,865 --> 01:49:09,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I was mulling over this when DDR Supernova came out earlier two years ago.

1487
01:49:09,788 --> 01:49:12,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, great job at PAX and here's to another great episode.

1488
01:49:12,611 --> 01:49:13,892
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Katamari's Forever.

1489
01:49:14,622 --> 01:49:18,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes too, the bundles and the game by itself come out at different times.

1490
01:49:18,584 --> 01:49:19,884
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something really important to keep in mind.

1491
01:49:19,904 --> 01:49:21,525
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to be happening with Rock Band 2.

1492
01:49:22,045 --> 01:49:26,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Band 2 is coming out as a standalone game on the 360 for about a month until you start seeing the bundles hit streets.

1493
01:49:27,328 --> 01:49:30,249
[SPEAKER_03]: So always keep that in mind when you see those types of things out in the wild too.

1494
01:49:31,124 --> 01:49:31,484
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1495
01:49:31,604 --> 01:49:37,107
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my birthday at the time of reading this, September 7th, so it would really make my day if you read this.

1496
01:49:37,147 --> 01:49:37,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1497
01:49:37,848 --> 01:49:38,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday!

1498
01:49:38,748 --> 01:49:39,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy damn birthday!

1499
01:49:40,189 --> 01:49:40,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Cha-cha-cha.

1500
01:49:41,109 --> 01:49:46,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And in closing, if a Yaris crashes in the middle of nowhere and no one hears it, does the crappy game still exist?

1501
01:49:47,013 --> 01:49:47,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, yes.

1502
01:49:47,813 --> 01:49:49,635
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm actually thinking of getting a Yaris.

1503
01:49:49,655 --> 01:49:51,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be buying a new car for Christmas.

1504
01:49:51,196 --> 01:50:00,724
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be my Christmas present to myself, I've decided, because my previous Toyota I've had since 2001, and it's 98, so it officially turned 10 years old this year.

1505
01:50:00,985 --> 01:50:01,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done.

1506
01:50:01,565 --> 01:50:05,128
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to put a gunshot in it and lay it down for a little while.

1507
01:50:06,610 --> 01:50:07,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually thinking about a Yaris.

1508
01:50:08,211 --> 01:50:09,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Toyotas.

1509
01:50:09,452 --> 01:50:13,736
[SPEAKER_05]: If Rob gets one, that means if he gives us a ride somewhere, we can just say we're taking a ride in his crappy game.

1510
01:50:14,298 --> 01:50:14,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1511
01:50:15,579 --> 01:50:17,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring all the jokes on that you want.

1512
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:19,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really, really considering it.

1513
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:20,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Part done.

1514
01:50:22,102 --> 01:50:22,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, no more emails.

1515
01:50:25,123 --> 01:50:27,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at orangelauncher.com if you want to get in for next weekend.

1516
01:50:27,544 --> 01:50:29,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, open the floodgates of chat room.

1517
01:50:30,306 --> 01:50:31,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Knock at me for wanting to get a Yaris.

1518
01:50:31,747 --> 01:50:33,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if there were more emails, I'm not reading them.

1519
01:50:35,288 --> 01:50:39,770
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I could say I'm coming on here and getting any car and somebody would taunt me for my choice.

1520
01:50:39,991 --> 01:50:40,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a Lancer.

1521
01:50:40,771 --> 01:50:42,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to have to do my own research.

1522
01:50:42,772 --> 01:50:42,852
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1523
01:50:43,453 --> 01:50:44,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1524
01:51:01,559 --> 01:51:03,200
[SPEAKER_05]: He talks to dogs.

1525
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:04,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he's the dog whisperer.

1526
01:51:04,901 --> 01:51:11,465
[SPEAKER_03]: See, either you knew that because you actually know it, in which case I'm going to make fun of you, or you knew that because you looked over here at my screen, in which case I'm going to pinch you.

1527
01:51:11,505 --> 01:51:12,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a red show roll.

1528
01:51:12,566 --> 01:51:12,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1529
01:51:13,806 --> 01:51:14,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what he does.

1530
01:51:14,587 --> 01:51:15,928
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the dog whisperer.

1531
01:51:17,008 --> 01:51:18,910
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like the horse whisperer, but with dogs.

1532
01:51:19,230 --> 01:51:22,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, they're making a game out of it.

1533
01:51:24,433 --> 01:51:27,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm leaving that pause for you to contemplate what this means for gaming.

1534
01:51:27,435 --> 01:51:27,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Game!

1535
01:51:29,145 --> 01:51:31,447
[SPEAKER_03]: and Nintendogs It Ain't, that's for sure.

1536
01:51:31,507 --> 01:51:34,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It is actually a TV show on National Geographic Channel.

1537
01:51:34,989 --> 01:51:38,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It was rated by the ESRB and then it kind of slipped away for a little while.

1538
01:51:38,612 --> 01:51:39,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now there's box art.

1539
01:51:39,833 --> 01:51:42,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really happening and a PC version.

1540
01:51:42,955 --> 01:51:53,482
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea what exactly you do in this game, but damn if you, I mean, I know they say don't judge a game by its cover, but for real, how can I not?

1541
01:51:54,062 --> 01:51:56,304
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a freaking dog whisperer game.

1542
01:51:57,978 --> 01:51:58,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

1543
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:00,861
[SPEAKER_03]: This game has been judged.

1544
01:52:01,821 --> 01:52:02,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Gong.

1545
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:03,883
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

1546
01:52:04,624 --> 01:52:05,305
[SPEAKER_05]: The end.

1547
01:52:05,445 --> 01:52:06,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Dog Whisperer.

1548
01:52:06,286 --> 01:52:08,948
[SPEAKER_03]: GameGuru says, sounds like another crappy Ubisoft game.

1549
01:52:08,968 --> 01:52:10,309
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what most people are saying, actually.

1550
01:52:10,329 --> 01:52:10,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like dog poo.

1551
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:12,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the dog pooper.

1552
01:52:13,112 --> 01:52:15,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Poobisoft, says Frisbee.

1553
01:52:15,614 --> 01:52:16,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1554
01:52:16,635 --> 01:52:20,919
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be their new name, Poobisoft, whenever they have a crappy game we're talking about on the show.

1555
01:52:21,339 --> 01:52:21,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1556
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:23,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget that.

1557
01:52:23,081 --> 01:52:23,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Poobisoft.

1558
01:52:24,822 --> 01:52:30,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's in chat and says it's not as bad as travel games for dummies on the DS and the My Stop Smoking Coach.

1559
01:52:30,904 --> 01:52:34,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say we talked about that My Stop Smoking Coach a few weeks ago when it was first announced.

1560
01:52:35,366 --> 01:52:38,227
[SPEAKER_03]: That isn't nearly as bad as the freaking Dog Whisperer.

1561
01:52:38,347 --> 01:52:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of potential for My Stop Smoking.

1562
01:52:40,848 --> 01:52:41,848
[SPEAKER_03]: But Dog Whisperer?

1563
01:52:42,428 --> 01:52:42,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1564
01:52:44,089 --> 01:52:44,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1565
01:52:46,289 --> 01:52:46,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1566
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Dog Whisperer.

1567
01:52:50,431 --> 01:52:50,571
[SPEAKER_03]: How?

1568
01:52:52,213 --> 01:52:54,415
[SPEAKER_03]: PluckyGuy wants to see a Dog the Bounty Hunter game.

1569
01:52:55,196 --> 01:52:55,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

1570
01:52:56,077 --> 01:52:57,319
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a controversial individual.

1571
01:52:57,339 --> 01:52:58,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've heard the stories.

1572
01:52:59,441 --> 01:53:00,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, new story, new story.

1573
01:53:02,244 --> 01:53:05,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story has to do with Space Invaders the keyboard.

1574
01:53:07,249 --> 01:53:10,153
[SPEAKER_05]: They have made a Space Invaders keyboard.

1575
01:53:11,374 --> 01:53:11,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

1576
01:53:13,334 --> 01:53:19,878
[SPEAKER_05]: It has little letters on top of the little aliens on the keys and you really can't see them that well unless you're staring at them.

1577
01:53:20,478 --> 01:53:22,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it has the shooty thing on the space bar.

1578
01:53:25,041 --> 01:53:27,743
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Space Invader keyboard for PC.

1579
01:53:29,747 --> 01:53:30,267
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1580
01:53:54,161 --> 01:53:56,141
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm going to do when my keyboard dies?

1581
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:58,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially after I punch it in the face.

1582
01:53:58,322 --> 01:53:59,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if it had a face.

1583
01:53:59,762 --> 01:54:02,423
[SPEAKER_05]: For the stupid fucking drivers not working.

1584
01:54:02,643 --> 01:54:04,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God I'm moving to Linux.

1585
01:54:05,123 --> 01:54:07,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to repaint it.

1586
01:54:09,944 --> 01:54:10,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for fun?

1587
01:54:10,924 --> 01:54:12,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to paint a big Pac-Man on it.

1588
01:54:12,845 --> 01:54:14,745
[SPEAKER_03]: You should paint fire on it.

1589
01:54:15,125 --> 01:54:16,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to paint Pac-Man on it.

1590
01:54:16,105 --> 01:54:17,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Paint Pac-Man on fire.

1591
01:54:18,466 --> 01:54:19,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Paint your butt on fire.

1592
01:54:21,215 --> 01:54:21,375
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1593
01:54:21,415 --> 01:54:22,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't eat Chipotle today.

1594
01:54:23,037 --> 01:54:25,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

1595
01:54:26,821 --> 01:54:27,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

1596
01:54:27,281 --> 01:54:30,104
[SPEAKER_03]: You know this shows hit rock bottom when we start making poopy jokes.

1597
01:54:30,484 --> 01:54:30,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1598
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:52,558
[SPEAKER_03]: by the way what a great lead into our next story speaking of lowest common denominator jokes I was going to say speaking of flaming butt every time the lowest common denominator gets brought up especially in games you can't help but reference the game Choaniki and if you don't know why Choaniki just google it

1599
01:54:53,058 --> 01:54:54,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Google it and you'll see why.

1600
01:54:55,219 --> 01:54:55,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

1601
01:54:56,019 --> 01:54:59,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Cho Iniki is... Now, this might come as a shock to you.

1602
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:01,341
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is out on Virtual Console in Japan.

1603
01:55:01,681 --> 01:55:03,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually came out in Europe as well.

1604
01:55:03,521 --> 01:55:04,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

1605
01:55:05,862 --> 01:55:07,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been rated by the ESRB.

1606
01:55:10,844 --> 01:55:12,724
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the American board.

1607
01:55:13,505 --> 01:55:16,786
[SPEAKER_03]: They rated it E10 for mild suggestive themes.

1608
01:55:17,659 --> 01:55:18,680
[SPEAKER_03]: No, here's the other thing.

1609
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:21,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been dated for Monday.

1610
01:55:22,322 --> 01:55:24,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm downloading Cho Aniki!

1611
01:55:24,022 --> 01:55:33,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning, by the time you hear this episode, if this story isn't bullshit, which, you know, when the ESRP's involved, it may not... You may be able to play Cho Aniki on Virtual Console in America.

1612
01:55:33,688 --> 01:55:34,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I just dropped my mic.

1613
01:55:34,148 --> 01:55:35,609
[SPEAKER_03]: The unthinkable has happened.

1614
01:55:35,749 --> 01:55:38,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie has been so excited, she dropped her mic.

1615
01:55:40,591 --> 01:55:41,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy.

1616
01:55:41,832 --> 01:55:43,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Cho Aniki is so much fun.

1617
01:55:45,379 --> 01:55:47,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of gay, actually.

1618
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:49,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very, very, very gay.

1619
01:55:50,061 --> 01:55:50,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But in a good way.

1620
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:55,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you actually go and say this game is gay, I'm actually going to agree with you.

1621
01:55:55,383 --> 01:55:56,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be like, yep, it is gay.

1622
01:56:00,065 --> 01:56:06,288
[SPEAKER_04]: This game totally does it with other games of the same gender.

1623
01:56:08,248 --> 01:56:10,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says it is on the Nintendo website.

1624
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:12,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening.

1625
01:56:13,649 --> 01:56:16,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars

1626
01:56:39,628 --> 01:56:40,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of the Seven Stars

1627
01:57:01,323 --> 01:57:02,524
[SPEAKER_03]: on the virtual console for download.

1628
01:57:03,044 --> 01:57:09,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Loki in chat says, and I'm sure he would say if he were here in studio right now, motherfucking Super Mario RPG.

1629
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:12,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Word, Loki, word.

1630
01:57:16,095 --> 01:57:17,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So, to continue on.

1631
01:57:18,076 --> 01:57:19,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, more, Choaniki 2?

1632
01:57:20,598 --> 01:57:20,918
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

1633
01:57:20,938 --> 01:57:26,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Quelltipo does want to point out, the first Choaniki game is the tamest in this series, and it is the first game.

1634
01:57:28,286 --> 01:57:29,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Sheet music, Rob.

1635
01:57:29,227 --> 01:57:29,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Sheet music.

1636
01:57:29,667 --> 01:57:30,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sheet music.

1637
01:57:30,548 --> 01:57:31,088
[SPEAKER_03]: What the sheet?

1638
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:39,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's sheet music that is titled Killer Instinct 3 main title.

1639
01:57:40,977 --> 01:57:42,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a fake.

1640
01:57:43,859 --> 01:57:46,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be Photoshop-ity.

1641
01:57:46,661 --> 01:57:48,323
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's been found somewhere.

1642
01:57:48,703 --> 01:57:49,344
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says...

1643
01:57:51,406 --> 01:58:01,230
[SPEAKER_05]: A Killer Instinct 3 And by the way, if anyone wants to hop out their MIDI recorder, it actually looks fairly complex and I can't play that high, so whatever.

1644
01:58:01,330 --> 01:58:03,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised nobody's tried to turn it into a MIDI file yet.

1645
01:58:03,651 --> 01:58:07,153
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing, what if it's just printed out from Cakewalk?

1646
01:58:07,373 --> 01:58:11,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's not that hard to make a fake song and print it out with a fake title.

1647
01:58:12,415 --> 01:58:12,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1648
01:58:12,735 --> 01:58:15,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my BS meter is going off the charts on this.

1649
01:58:15,816 --> 01:58:19,077
[SPEAKER_05]: But you remember the Christmas card thing that Rare did before?

1650
01:58:19,457 --> 01:58:19,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

1651
01:58:20,318 --> 01:58:22,078
[SPEAKER_05]: With the KI3 Christmas card?

1652
01:58:22,298 --> 01:58:22,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1653
01:58:23,239 --> 01:58:25,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there was that, and now we have this music.

1654
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:29,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And now there were other rumors that were floating around.

1655
01:58:29,721 --> 01:58:33,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there was the Fulgore picture, remember?

1656
01:58:34,442 --> 01:58:34,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1657
01:58:35,202 --> 01:58:36,863
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could happen.

1658
01:58:37,759 --> 01:58:38,500
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could not.

1659
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:40,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked Killer Instinct.

1660
01:58:40,582 --> 01:58:41,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.

1661
01:58:41,043 --> 01:58:42,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, but I don't know.

1662
01:58:43,105 --> 01:58:45,227
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a hell of an announcement maybe in 2009.

1663
01:58:45,968 --> 01:58:46,409
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1664
01:58:46,869 --> 01:58:47,250
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

1665
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:48,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to hold my breath.

1666
01:58:49,051 --> 01:58:50,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love nothing more than this.

1667
01:58:51,894 --> 01:58:52,695
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1668
01:59:25,157 --> 01:59:33,784
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week goes to the man with the small penis driving the truck that uses too much gas at the shopping center where I got my Starbucks from.

1669
01:59:36,265 --> 01:59:37,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop doing cocaine!

1670
01:59:41,089 --> 01:59:42,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much I should say.

1671
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:44,352
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes to...

1672
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:46,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say it.

1673
01:59:46,781 --> 01:59:48,661
[SPEAKER_03]: A particular individual I'm thinking of.

1674
01:59:48,742 --> 01:59:51,623
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't want to say it because if you give it attention, it only grows.

1675
01:59:52,443 --> 01:59:59,647
[SPEAKER_03]: A particular individual I'm thinking of that really, really needs to stop stalking me.

1676
02:00:00,007 --> 02:00:01,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And this isn't a joke.

1677
02:00:02,028 --> 02:00:03,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an OLR listener thing.

1678
02:00:03,689 --> 02:00:04,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something going on in my real life.

1679
02:00:05,190 --> 02:00:12,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly feel like I'm being stalked by a certain individual that needs to cut the shit out and just move on with themselves because it's so frustrating.

1680
02:00:13,353 --> 02:00:14,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.

1681
02:00:15,037 --> 02:00:15,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop being immature.

1682
02:00:16,199 --> 02:00:16,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow up.

1683
02:00:17,562 --> 02:00:18,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow up.

1684
02:00:19,745 --> 02:00:20,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow up!

1685
02:00:21,989 --> 02:00:22,310
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1686
02:00:24,133 --> 02:00:25,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's it, huh?

1687
02:00:25,315 --> 02:00:26,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's no one else here.

1688
02:00:26,838 --> 02:00:27,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Just you and me.

1689
02:00:30,246 --> 02:00:31,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then I guess I'll do another story, huh?

1690
02:00:32,127 --> 02:00:32,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say so.

1691
02:00:33,008 --> 02:00:33,308
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1692
02:00:34,569 --> 02:00:35,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live.

1693
02:00:35,369 --> 02:00:41,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if I want to take my aggressions out on something, I could punch people, and I will be able to do that in King of Fighters 98.

1694
02:00:41,613 --> 02:00:44,174
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is going to Xbox Live Arcade.

1695
02:00:44,214 --> 02:00:45,115
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Fatal Fury?

1696
02:00:45,475 --> 02:00:47,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I have several versions of that game.

1697
02:01:13,476 --> 02:01:15,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably before the end of the year, I'd imagine.

1698
02:01:15,102 --> 02:01:17,610
[SPEAKER_03]: King of Finders 98 on Virtual Console.

1699
02:01:17,791 --> 02:01:18,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to check that out.

1700
02:01:19,457 --> 02:01:19,738
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1701
02:01:21,690 --> 02:01:31,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in other news, and this makes me specifically happy, and this is what actually brought it to my attention, is that one of my LiveJournal friends linked the trailer for Dissidia, Final Fantasy.

1702
02:01:34,074 --> 02:01:35,355
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a YouTube video up.

1703
02:01:35,715 --> 02:01:47,059
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, it's a dramatic progressive action that's supposed to be like a fighting game with an RPG element, I think.

1704
02:01:47,939 --> 02:01:51,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but you move through a field map and then you have to fight different people.

1705
02:01:51,182 --> 02:02:03,674
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's sort of actually, um, some of the, uh, fighting sequences are actually a lot like what was in Kingdom Hearts 2 where you run up walls and do all kinds of special stuff and earn points.

1706
02:02:04,334 --> 02:02:06,796
[SPEAKER_05]: But the cool thing about this is actually, um...

1707
02:02:07,737 --> 02:02:09,278
[SPEAKER_05]: who the characters in the games are.

1708
02:02:10,099 --> 02:02:12,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you've got your villains and your heroes.

1709
02:02:12,161 --> 02:02:16,364
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got the Warrior of Light from Final Fantasy versus Garland.

1710
02:02:16,785 --> 02:02:19,107
[SPEAKER_05]: You have Frianel from Final Fantasy 2 and Unite.

1711
02:02:19,727 --> 02:02:24,331
[SPEAKER_05]: They've shown Squall and Zidane and Tidus.

1712
02:02:24,891 --> 02:02:35,920
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also, for some of the villains, there was the Emperor from Final Fantasy 2, Cloud of Darkness, Golbez, X-Death, Kefka, Sephiroth, Ultimecia, Kuja, and Jax from the...

1713
02:02:36,721 --> 02:02:37,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Other ones.

1714
02:02:37,201 --> 02:02:43,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm sure there's going to be more people from the other Final Fantasy games, some of the heroes coming into it.

1715
02:02:43,626 --> 02:02:47,088
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's going to be pretty cool.

1716
02:02:47,208 --> 02:02:47,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to it.

1717
02:02:48,029 --> 02:02:50,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say, my inner fanboy is very pleased.

1718
02:02:51,411 --> 02:02:54,473
[SPEAKER_03]: This game's been a little bit off the radar, but it looks hot.

1719
02:02:54,894 --> 02:02:56,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I really want to check this out when it comes out.

1720
02:02:56,915 --> 02:02:57,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hate admitting that.

1721
02:02:58,136 --> 02:02:59,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know what I mean?

1722
02:03:00,305 --> 02:03:01,526
[SPEAKER_03]: But this game looks awesome.

1723
02:03:01,687 --> 02:03:04,750
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's supposed to be just all the major heroes versus the major villains.

1724
02:03:06,372 --> 02:03:07,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It has freaking Garland in it.

1725
02:03:07,934 --> 02:03:08,815
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

1726
02:03:09,609 --> 02:03:15,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Nomura is doing the character designs, but trying to keep some of Amano's style to it.

1727
02:03:16,353 --> 02:03:17,634
[SPEAKER_05]: At least some of the characters are.

1728
02:03:19,115 --> 02:03:28,421
[SPEAKER_05]: But they also said they used Jekt instead of Seymour for the Final Fantasy X references so they didn't have to put Yuna in it.

1729
02:03:31,303 --> 02:03:31,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1730
02:03:32,216 --> 02:03:36,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there'd be too many people that would get too big of a thrill out of punching Yuna in the face, sadly.

1731
02:03:37,038 --> 02:03:37,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Yuna fans.

1732
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:43,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said that it's actually supposed to have twice as much dialogue as Crisis Core.

1733
02:03:44,802 --> 02:03:45,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang.

1734
02:03:46,402 --> 02:03:46,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1735
02:03:47,043 --> 02:03:47,723
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be fun.

1736
02:03:48,023 --> 02:03:48,443
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1737
02:03:48,844 --> 02:03:49,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping so.

1738
02:03:50,313 --> 02:03:54,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well another game that could be fun, Warhammer Online.

1739
02:03:54,735 --> 02:03:59,377
[SPEAKER_03]: As you notice if you're listening to Part A, I had some fairly favorable things to say about the game during my little review of it.

1740
02:03:59,417 --> 02:04:03,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it at Penny Arcade Expo, and a lot of you have been getting the chance to check this out too.

1741
02:04:03,298 --> 02:04:08,981
[SPEAKER_03]: The open beta launched this weekend, playing Warhammer Online.

1742
02:04:09,041 --> 02:04:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: The beta launched earlier this morning.

1743
02:04:10,721 --> 02:04:13,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, of course, it hasn't gone without some flaws.

1744
02:04:13,883 --> 02:04:14,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently some of the

1745
02:04:15,083 --> 02:04:15,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1746
02:04:38,431 --> 02:04:40,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it looks like there's a lot of problems with it.

1747
02:04:40,712 --> 02:04:45,454
[SPEAKER_03]: But in theory, the beta is open, but it's probably just going to take a couple days for it to be ironed out.

1748
02:04:45,494 --> 02:04:45,974
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1749
02:04:46,314 --> 02:04:47,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at the long-term thing.

1750
02:04:48,135 --> 02:04:54,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better this happen now than the day the game is actually supposed to come out and be on shelves and be out there for everybody, right?

1751
02:04:54,317 --> 02:04:55,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just me?

1752
02:04:55,437 --> 02:04:55,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1753
02:04:56,038 --> 02:04:56,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather this happen now.

1754
02:04:57,018 --> 02:05:04,921
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, then again, if I were one of these people trying to work my butt off to get in, I would probably also be pretty pissed, especially if I just happen to be outside the United States.

1755
02:05:04,961 --> 02:05:07,122
[SPEAKER_03]: That's never cool to get the shaft.

1756
02:05:07,802 --> 02:05:09,024
[SPEAKER_03]: because of where you live.

1757
02:05:10,766 --> 02:05:11,768
[SPEAKER_03]: But in theory, it's up.

1758
02:05:12,549 --> 02:05:14,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, it'll get ironed out in the next couple days.

1759
02:05:14,392 --> 02:05:14,712
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1760
02:05:15,053 --> 02:05:18,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Skypline will be open very soon at www.orangelaunchradio.com.

1761
02:05:18,518 --> 02:05:23,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on Interact With Us, our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, or 1-877-GAME-OLR in the U.S.

1762
02:05:23,705 --> 02:05:24,046
[SPEAKER_03]: and Canada.

1763
02:05:25,447 --> 02:05:41,550
[SPEAKER_05]: for people who are interested in Call of Duty 5 at least as far as our European listeners the World at War multiplayer beta will be out for PC and Xbox 360 in October the PS3 one has not yet been announced there's a chance it may not happen and

1764
02:05:42,811 --> 02:05:43,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing about we.

1765
02:05:44,092 --> 02:05:52,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will be... They said the boot camp will open its doors and they haven't named a date yet.

1766
02:05:53,076 --> 02:06:01,179
[SPEAKER_05]: But the speculation though would be November 14th for the actual release date.

1767
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:02,160
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1768
02:06:04,150 --> 02:06:08,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're thinking that it would probably correspond with the US one.

1769
02:06:09,632 --> 02:06:17,715
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, you'll be able to use the squad system, be able to try some of the other new modes in it, the multiplayer mode.

1770
02:06:18,195 --> 02:06:20,956
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be pretty cool, and I'd like to see what people think about it.

1771
02:06:21,956 --> 02:06:28,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty 4 was really freaking cool, so I have high expectations for Call of Duty 5.

1772
02:06:30,599 --> 02:06:33,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well hopefully Call of Duty 5 does not disappoint.

1773
02:06:34,753 --> 02:06:35,414
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1774
02:06:54,935 --> 02:06:56,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Social Networking Site Raptor RAPTR

1775
02:07:14,609 --> 02:07:16,851
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also download an optional PC client.

1776
02:07:17,131 --> 02:07:25,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what it does is the service kind of watches you on all of these various sites, and it tracks all of your gaming progress, so to speak, on one site.

1777
02:07:26,138 --> 02:07:29,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it'll let your friends know when you're online and playing games.

1778
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:33,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're actually using the free PC client, folks can see when I'm playing World of Warcraft.

1779
02:07:34,224 --> 02:07:42,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're kind of one of those people that always has a hard time finding friends to play online games with or whatever, whenever they're online, Raptor could be an option.

1780
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:43,590
[SPEAKER_03]: RAPTOR.COM

1781
02:08:08,908 --> 02:08:12,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful when you think about those things because these sites really try to get you to link to everything.

1782
02:08:13,592 --> 02:08:20,656
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just trying to hoard out to as many people as possible so that they can get their numbers up to possibly sell ads or whatever they're going to do in the future.

1783
02:08:22,818 --> 02:08:23,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be interesting.

1784
02:08:25,459 --> 02:08:25,800
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1785
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:29,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I really would like to get them on the show and just ask them what's the point.

1786
02:08:29,942 --> 02:08:30,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they can justify it.

1787
02:08:30,883 --> 02:08:32,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine there's got to be a reason to it.

1788
02:08:32,104 --> 02:08:34,145
[SPEAKER_03]: They've had a lot of money invested in it.

1789
02:08:34,385 --> 02:08:36,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's from one of the co-creators of

1790
02:08:38,493 --> 02:08:39,714
[SPEAKER_03]: God, what was the other thing he made?

1791
02:08:41,294 --> 02:08:41,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1792
02:08:41,795 --> 02:08:43,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Steam?

1793
02:08:44,296 --> 02:08:44,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't quote me on that.

1794
02:08:44,916 --> 02:08:45,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody in chat will probably remember.

1795
02:08:46,917 --> 02:08:49,138
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy made something else that was really big and popular.

1796
02:08:49,859 --> 02:08:50,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember off the top of my head.

1797
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:52,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember either.

1798
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:53,441
[SPEAKER_03]: But I signed up for it.

1799
02:08:53,481 --> 02:08:55,422
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send me a friend request, I guess so.

1800
02:08:56,842 --> 02:08:57,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky is just my name on there.

1801
02:08:57,983 --> 02:08:58,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Twitter.

1802
02:08:58,643 --> 02:08:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: S-K-I-E.

1803
02:08:59,644 --> 02:09:00,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you go.

1804
02:09:01,325 --> 02:09:03,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're my stalker, then you can't add me.

1805
02:09:03,125 --> 02:09:03,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1806
02:09:06,207 --> 02:09:07,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't need that person finding me in Warcraft.

1807
02:09:09,286 --> 02:09:11,869
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 here Last week I got around to playing Street Fighter 4

1808
02:09:32,927 --> 02:09:41,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I didn't really play it much, so I don't know much about the game mechanics and stuff, but the first thing you see is the graphics, and they're really nice.

1809
02:09:42,453 --> 02:09:46,196
[SPEAKER_08]: My complaint is that the male fighters look a little too muscular.

1810
02:09:48,154 --> 02:09:50,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the female fighters have too big of boobies?

1811
02:09:50,115 --> 02:09:52,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everything is really overemphasized or what?

1812
02:09:52,997 --> 02:09:53,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

1813
02:09:54,458 --> 02:10:06,646
[SPEAKER_08]: What they liked about the setup here at San Jose State was that they had two cabinets and they're linked up so that way... Which is good because not only does each player have their own cabinet like those Japanese cabinets but...

1814
02:10:08,327 --> 02:10:14,994
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also play one player mode without if someone else is already playing in this mode called beginner mode.

1815
02:10:15,054 --> 02:10:18,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And it basically lets you go three rounds without anyone challenging you.

1816
02:10:19,378 --> 02:10:21,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is nice because I suck at fighting games.

1817
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:24,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us an idea, how big is this game?

1818
02:10:24,302 --> 02:10:26,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, were there just tons and tons of people there to play?

1819
02:10:27,926 --> 02:10:29,928
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always people playing.

1820
02:10:32,556 --> 02:10:36,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this game really getting out there?

1821
02:10:36,421 --> 02:10:40,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been so distracted by all the other goings on in the PAX world and all that.

1822
02:10:40,346 --> 02:10:43,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really been following, but I know it was really big when it got into a couple arcades.

1823
02:10:43,971 --> 02:10:47,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it slowly finding its way into more and more and more places where it's not too hard to find now?

1824
02:10:49,864 --> 02:10:51,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how to go down there.

1825
02:10:51,605 --> 02:10:55,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Only until I went down there did I discover that we finally have Street Fighter 4 here in the Bay Area.

1826
02:10:57,908 --> 02:11:01,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as I've said before, the arcade scene is dying.

1827
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:08,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, new arcade games tend to catch the gaming community as a whole by surprise these days.

1828
02:11:08,334 --> 02:11:14,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas for games on PC and console, we know exactly when they're going to come out, so there's no surprise to that.

1829
02:11:15,205 --> 02:11:19,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to point out in chat, AkumaJP has some comments about the Street Fighter 4 graphics.

1830
02:11:19,429 --> 02:11:22,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Says the muscle is good and Chun-Li has an elephant leg.

1831
02:11:23,533 --> 02:11:25,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So her legs are even thicker than ever?

1832
02:11:26,636 --> 02:11:28,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Chun-Li has amazing thighs.

1833
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:31,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Sheik would put Marilee Rett into shame.

1834
02:11:32,862 --> 02:11:35,524
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1835
02:11:35,544 --> 02:11:38,427
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68, any other thoughts on Street Fighter 4 before we get to another call?

1836
02:11:39,361 --> 02:11:41,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, shit ass, I need to also say I forgot.

1837
02:11:41,363 --> 02:11:47,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, now that Super Mario RPG is out, I can't wait for all of you game fans to complain, where's my Earthbound?

1838
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:48,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's my Earthbound?

1839
02:11:49,052 --> 02:11:50,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll start, where's my Earthbound?

1840
02:11:51,455 --> 02:11:51,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1841
02:11:52,316 --> 02:11:54,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have a good one GS68, take care buddy.

1842
02:11:55,239 --> 02:11:55,579
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

1843
02:11:55,699 --> 02:11:56,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1844
02:11:57,501 --> 02:12:00,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, PluckyGuy in chat says, I kinda like Chun-Li's Jungle Booty.

1845
02:12:02,130 --> 02:12:03,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing wrong with a big butt.

1846
02:12:03,511 --> 02:12:06,872
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877... Just rub like big butts and cannot lie.

1847
02:12:07,312 --> 02:12:08,233
[SPEAKER_03]: You other brothers can't deny.

1848
02:12:08,253 --> 02:12:16,236
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call here live on this Sunday evening, September the 7th of 2008.

1849
02:12:17,877 --> 02:12:18,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the phones.

1850
02:12:19,398 --> 02:12:20,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1851
02:12:20,778 --> 02:12:21,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1852
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:25,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

1853
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:26,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, hi, who's this?

1854
02:12:26,681 --> 02:12:27,321
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1855
02:12:27,341 --> 02:12:28,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, this is Sag.

1856
02:12:28,522 --> 02:12:30,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Sag, my friend.

1857
02:12:30,803 --> 02:12:31,303
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

1858
02:12:32,057 --> 02:12:33,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing quite alright, and yourself?

1859
02:12:34,039 --> 02:12:35,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I am doing awesome.

1860
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:36,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, I met you.

1861
02:12:38,023 --> 02:12:40,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Zeg was one of my buddies, lives in the Bay Area.

1862
02:12:40,345 --> 02:12:42,727
[SPEAKER_05]: The cupcake shop, or store, right?

1863
02:12:43,488 --> 02:12:45,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he told the cupcake story, but nobody's going to get that.

1864
02:12:46,410 --> 02:12:48,933
[SPEAKER_03]: He also wore the manly corset one day, which was great.

1865
02:12:48,953 --> 02:12:50,734
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a fabulously manly corset.

1866
02:12:50,995 --> 02:12:52,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely showed off your hourglass figure.

1867
02:12:53,417 --> 02:12:55,339
[SPEAKER_11]: And only three jerks that day, too.

1868
02:12:56,279 --> 02:12:57,881
[SPEAKER_11]: I was quite surprised.

1869
02:12:59,111 --> 02:13:02,453
[SPEAKER_11]: That there weren't as many jerks there.

1870
02:13:02,473 --> 02:13:03,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcomely surprised.

1871
02:13:03,895 --> 02:13:08,779
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just be glad you weren't the guy in the Princess Peach outfit because his picture got on blogs and stuff.

1872
02:13:10,701 --> 02:13:11,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1873
02:13:11,201 --> 02:13:11,481
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1874
02:13:11,501 --> 02:13:12,802
[SPEAKER_03]: You've inspired me, Seg.

1875
02:13:12,883 --> 02:13:15,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year, I'm going to push the cross-dressing envelope.

1876
02:13:16,555 --> 02:13:17,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't cross-dressing.

1877
02:13:18,036 --> 02:13:19,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you weren't, but I'm just saying.

1878
02:13:19,116 --> 02:13:22,117
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just making sure for everyone else listening in.

1879
02:13:22,277 --> 02:13:26,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to incorporate a little more femininity into my outfits.

1880
02:13:28,318 --> 02:13:28,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1881
02:13:28,718 --> 02:13:30,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think you need to parade through the con as Frank.

1882
02:13:31,839 --> 02:13:34,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I bring my full Frankenfurter regalia next year?

1883
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:36,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it.

1884
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also need the curly mullet wig.

1885
02:13:38,441 --> 02:13:38,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

1886
02:13:39,001 --> 02:13:39,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1887
02:13:39,341 --> 02:13:42,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Seg probably had things he wanted to talk about that aren't corsets.

1888
02:13:42,422 --> 02:13:43,202
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, Seg?

1889
02:13:44,232 --> 02:13:47,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it is in the similar vein of PAX.

1890
02:13:47,975 --> 02:13:53,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't really look up for any confirmation, but I heard talks that PAX is thinking about doing East Coast.

1891
02:13:55,061 --> 02:14:11,355
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I want to propose out to the listeners and all that is, how do you think the whole convention dynamic would change with a major East Coast specific for video games conference?

1892
02:14:12,287 --> 02:14:13,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to say this real quick.

1893
02:14:13,308 --> 02:14:16,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been confirmed by the Penny Arcade Expo organizers, Boston in 2010.

1894
02:14:16,929 --> 02:14:18,950
[SPEAKER_03]: They have already booked the venue, apparently.

1895
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:19,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1896
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:19,851
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wasn't 100%.

1897
02:14:20,411 --> 02:14:21,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot where I read it.

1898
02:14:21,631 --> 02:14:22,092
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's all right.

1899
02:14:23,032 --> 02:14:25,113
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, timing is everything, in my opinion.

1900
02:14:25,233 --> 02:14:29,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they can get away with doing two shows in a year if they're really well spaced out.

1901
02:14:29,535 --> 02:14:34,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, you know, if it's true that they're doing it in April, that's not a bad time to do it because you have a lot of game releases.

1902
02:14:34,798 --> 02:14:36,118
[SPEAKER_03]: When are most games released?

1903
02:14:36,379 --> 02:14:39,240
[SPEAKER_03]: They're released in the early summer or they're released right before Christmas.

1904
02:14:39,600 --> 02:15:08,904
[SPEAKER_03]: so if you have your early April show kind of promoting those spring games and you have the August show promoting the holiday games which PAX is kind of doing I think they can pull it off I would be very curious to see though if it ends up kind of if each con kind of eats each other but maybe that's what they want and when I say that I mean is attendance going to go down at one because now they have this other one available but maybe in a way that's what they want maybe that's how they're trying to control Seattle from getting too big go ahead

1905
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:17,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, to me, as someone who lived in the East Coast and the Midwest, I grew up in Michigan and also lived in Boston for a few years.

1906
02:15:18,722 --> 02:15:20,344
[SPEAKER_11]: There was... I mean, there are...

1907
02:15:22,196 --> 02:15:22,736
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1908
02:15:44,313 --> 02:16:01,480
[SPEAKER_11]: If nothing else comes down, a large big name on the East Coast, that PAX really has a very interesting opportunity here to be something, to really fill a demand that hasn't been filled yet with East Coast.

1909
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:05,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you've got all the people that wanted to go but couldn't make that big huge stretch out there.

1910
02:16:05,282 --> 02:16:06,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's a little bit more easier.

1911
02:16:07,122 --> 02:16:08,763
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, oh, it's just a weekend.

1912
02:16:10,144 --> 02:16:13,545
[SPEAKER_11]: It's less than a day to get there versus a flight across the country.

1913
02:16:14,175 --> 02:16:14,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Harmonix, 2K, Rockstar

1914
02:16:42,575 --> 02:16:59,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I know there's people that definitely travel, but there's definitely a lot of people, I mean, there's a lot of friends I have in both of those regions that definitely can't schedule out such a huge disruption to take a lot of time off work because they have to fly across the country, but

1915
02:17:00,481 --> 02:17:05,784
[SPEAKER_11]: If it was right in their hometown or very close by, that's a lot of names there.

1916
02:17:05,864 --> 02:17:12,907
[SPEAKER_11]: And as far as not as many, yeah, the total amount of studios between the coast definitely leans towards West Coast.

1917
02:17:13,207 --> 02:17:17,109
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's still a lot of big-name studios that had to fly everything else over.

1918
02:17:17,429 --> 02:17:19,591
[SPEAKER_03]: and not every West Coast studio went to PAX either.

1919
02:17:19,691 --> 02:17:23,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, I made fun of Capcom earlier and Konami was another big name that wasn't there.

1920
02:17:23,274 --> 02:17:25,216
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, not everybody's going to PAX yet.

1921
02:17:25,256 --> 02:17:25,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

1922
02:17:26,197 --> 02:17:33,263
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that also works to their advantage where they'll still get big names but they're not going to be flooding the doors like, say, Comic Con on vendors.

1923
02:17:34,527 --> 02:17:35,387
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it could be interesting.

1924
02:17:35,487 --> 02:17:36,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder how many people would go to both.

1925
02:17:37,108 --> 02:17:37,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm crazy enough.

1926
02:17:37,868 --> 02:17:38,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I would want to go to both.

1927
02:17:38,868 --> 02:17:39,848
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I love the East Coast.

1928
02:17:39,868 --> 02:17:40,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I would want to go visit.

1929
02:17:40,708 --> 02:17:42,149
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also have places to crash at.

1930
02:17:42,209 --> 02:17:44,029
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I have plenty of friends to crash at.

1931
02:17:44,089 --> 02:17:45,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if the shows are different enough.

1932
02:17:45,689 --> 02:17:52,031
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do get those different exhibitors that show up on the East Coast versus the West Coast, I think it could be sustainable for two cons.

1933
02:17:52,311 --> 02:17:56,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And shit, if they're serious about doing the Europe con too, shit, people will probably go to that too.

1934
02:17:57,452 --> 02:17:59,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know if we would, because it's a lot harder.

1935
02:17:59,514 --> 02:18:01,836
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you talk international flight, that's a big one.

1936
02:18:02,177 --> 02:18:10,945
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm sure, you know, if they're doing Eurogamer Expo and Leipzig is growing leaps and bounds, what they were saying, what, like 200,000 freaking people at Leipzig or something?

1937
02:18:11,485 --> 02:18:14,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, you know, my coworkers were at Leipzig.

1938
02:18:14,688 --> 02:18:14,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeesh.

1939
02:18:15,449 --> 02:18:15,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeesh.

1940
02:18:16,410 --> 02:18:20,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Bobby Blackwolf's in chat and says, I do eight hours from each.

1941
02:18:20,774 --> 02:18:24,718
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of folks in chat are saying I would love to go to PAX East and I know I would like to go too.

1942
02:18:25,058 --> 02:18:29,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And Actdeft, our poor listener in Mexico says, I would just like to have a MexicoCon, please.

1943
02:18:30,643 --> 02:18:31,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Start one.

1944
02:18:32,525 --> 02:18:32,966
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

1945
02:18:33,686 --> 02:18:34,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Call it Mexicon.

1946
02:18:35,248 --> 02:18:35,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexicon?

1947
02:18:36,529 --> 02:18:37,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1948
02:18:38,951 --> 02:18:43,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Seg, we got a long call but it's been a great call but I gotta wrap it up.

1949
02:18:43,055 --> 02:18:45,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we go to the next call?

1950
02:18:46,431 --> 02:18:48,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, I have to self-promote.

1951
02:18:49,372 --> 02:18:55,055
[SPEAKER_11]: All cool and attractive people, and that includes you, must, you know, look into getting Strong Bad.

1952
02:18:56,375 --> 02:18:57,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Have to plug my own thing.

1953
02:18:57,956 --> 02:19:04,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know if you wanted to talk about that, but yes, you worked on the Strong Bad game, so you're very excited about the release, and I hear it's doing very well, right?

1954
02:19:04,238 --> 02:19:06,199
[SPEAKER_03]: What, third week in a row it's top of the charts on Wii?

1955
02:19:06,259 --> 02:19:07,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Third week on the top of the charts.

1956
02:19:07,740 --> 02:19:08,640
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go for four!

1957
02:19:09,321 --> 02:19:10,081
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, take care.

1958
02:19:10,201 --> 02:19:10,941
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, take care, buddy.

1959
02:19:11,502 --> 02:19:11,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1960
02:19:11,882 --> 02:19:12,402
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, bye-bye.

1961
02:19:13,823 --> 02:19:19,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.

1962
02:19:20,791 --> 02:19:22,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be so down with PAX Boston, wouldn't you?

1963
02:19:23,894 --> 02:19:26,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be down if someone would pay my way.

1964
02:19:26,537 --> 02:19:27,978
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can make it work, we never know.

1965
02:19:28,379 --> 02:19:29,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get another phone call.

1966
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:31,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1967
02:19:32,583 --> 02:19:34,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's the Rob D. Hey, Rob D. Hello!

1968
02:19:34,706 --> 02:19:35,767
[SPEAKER_03]: What is on your mind, my friend?

1969
02:19:36,969 --> 02:19:37,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much.

1970
02:19:37,889 --> 02:19:42,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this connection actually works out pretty well, because I'm on a new ISP, so the Skype connection may drop.

1971
02:19:43,191 --> 02:19:43,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, so good.

1972
02:19:44,652 --> 02:19:46,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to talk about PAX, really.

1973
02:19:46,312 --> 02:19:46,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much.

1974
02:19:49,073 --> 02:19:50,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what did you think of PAX?

1975
02:19:50,774 --> 02:19:51,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, walk us through it.

1976
02:19:52,469 --> 02:19:52,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.

1977
02:19:53,269 --> 02:19:54,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw you guys there, which is excellent.

1978
02:19:54,490 --> 02:19:56,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I saw many all-gamers there.

1979
02:19:56,271 --> 02:19:58,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about 25, somewhere around there.

1980
02:19:58,792 --> 02:20:02,013
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually ended up being a very good all-games meetup, a very good OLR meetup.

1981
02:20:02,834 --> 02:20:07,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Kevin DDR from the OLR chatroom and some other just really great people.

1982
02:20:07,376 --> 02:20:10,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was really surprised that... Well, I shouldn't say that.

1983
02:20:10,137 --> 02:20:14,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't say that I was surprised, but it was really great to see that everyone there was really just a cool person.

1984
02:20:15,219 --> 02:20:18,601
[SPEAKER_01]: No one misrepresented themselves online in any way.

1985
02:20:19,969 --> 02:20:21,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone was just a lot of fun to be around.

1986
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:23,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is something we usually say in the past.

1987
02:20:23,931 --> 02:20:29,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think all games really does this, but it was nice to see that everybody kind of adopted that creed of don't be a dick.

1988
02:20:29,834 --> 02:20:32,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody was an asshole, which is a good thing.

1989
02:20:32,555 --> 02:20:35,177
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because Wil Wheaton had a sign up that said don't be a dick.

1990
02:20:36,577 --> 02:20:39,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for me, I was an asshole.

1991
02:20:39,598 --> 02:20:42,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob was the biggest diva the whole time.

1992
02:20:42,860 --> 02:20:43,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm king of nice, damn it.

1993
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:47,041
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but seriously, in all seriousness, everybody was cool.

1994
02:20:47,541 --> 02:20:48,362
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1995
02:20:48,402 --> 02:20:52,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes when you meet strangers from the internet, you get a few weirdos in there, but everybody was pretty cool.

1996
02:20:53,897 --> 02:20:56,959
[SPEAKER_01]: and having dinner with you guys and actually being able to talk with you guys.

1997
02:20:57,979 --> 02:21:08,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I will admit that when we were actually broadcasting, just being surrounded by Bobby, you, DarkSakura, and Loki, I was like, what am I doing here?

1998
02:21:08,203 --> 02:21:09,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't belong here.

1999
02:21:09,204 --> 02:21:11,085
[SPEAKER_03]: You were being awesome is what you were doing.

2000
02:21:11,265 --> 02:21:11,645
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.

2001
02:21:12,245 --> 02:21:13,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little bit, definitely.

2002
02:21:35,185 --> 02:21:35,886
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2003
02:21:52,691 --> 02:21:53,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he definitely said that.

2004
02:21:54,692 --> 02:22:00,856
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually said that when he stepped up to the mic, he was shaking a little bit, which I thought was kind of funny, although I shouldn't make fun of him too much.

2005
02:22:00,916 --> 02:22:06,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's probably the first time he's ever done anything like that, like over the internet and broadcasting and that sort of thing.

2006
02:22:06,460 --> 02:22:07,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you learn it's no big deal.

2007
02:22:07,901 --> 02:22:09,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Any schmo can get an internet show, right?

2008
02:22:10,522 --> 02:22:10,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

2009
02:22:11,043 --> 02:22:11,283
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2010
02:22:12,484 --> 02:22:15,506
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the actual games and sights and sounds of PAX?

2011
02:22:15,526 --> 02:22:17,587
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of games did you play at PAX that you liked?

2012
02:22:19,420 --> 02:22:24,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I played Mortal Kombat vs. DC, which surprised me because it was actually fun.

2013
02:22:25,041 --> 02:22:25,942
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Mortal Kombat game.

2014
02:22:25,982 --> 02:22:27,262
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll never be a competitive fighter.

2015
02:22:27,282 --> 02:22:28,502
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what Mortal Kombat's for.

2016
02:22:28,642 --> 02:22:44,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Mortal Kombat's really just for the fatalities, all the fun party game stuff, watching someone break someone else's body over their back and seeing 18 tibias and fibulas fly, even though no human could possibly have that many bones in their body.

2017
02:22:45,926 --> 02:22:48,207
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all the same bone over and over.

2018
02:22:49,795 --> 02:22:50,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

2019
02:22:51,096 --> 02:22:52,978
[SPEAKER_01]: But what else did I see?

2020
02:22:53,839 --> 02:22:58,784
[SPEAKER_01]: The TNA Impact game, which I am a little bit of a wrestling fan, so I had to play that.

2021
02:22:59,444 --> 02:22:59,905
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sad.

2022
02:22:59,985 --> 02:23:01,947
[SPEAKER_01]: No one was playing that when I actually went up there.

2023
02:23:02,027 --> 02:23:07,312
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the developers was there by himself playing his own game, which marked me as... It was kind of sad in a way.

2024
02:23:08,033 --> 02:23:09,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I went up there and played him, and it was a good time.

2025
02:23:10,175 --> 02:23:11,336
[SPEAKER_03]: You made his day, probably.

2026
02:23:11,356 --> 02:23:11,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2027
02:23:12,383 --> 02:23:24,111
[SPEAKER_01]: probably, although not as much as I made the day of the Lox Quest people because one of them actually stood right by me and walked me through the game and explained the different steps of development.

2028
02:23:25,672 --> 02:23:26,832
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no idea who I am.

2029
02:23:28,473 --> 02:23:34,377
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hoping that I'm probably some gaming journalist, but I'm just a fan and they're taking all this time to tell me that because I'm probably the first person to go by there.

2030
02:23:34,477 --> 02:23:36,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Tower defense games are not exactly big things at PAX.

2031
02:23:38,168 --> 02:23:38,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Those poor guys.

2032
02:23:38,729 --> 02:23:44,734
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I gotta say, though, PAX does give a really good shot to, like, the indie developers and stuff, especially with that PAX 10 thing.

2033
02:23:45,054 --> 02:23:47,537
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those 10 indie games were right in the middle of the show floor.

2034
02:23:47,597 --> 02:23:48,297
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't miss them.

2035
02:23:48,618 --> 02:23:51,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's probably how Jamie got caught with the sushi game and all that stuff.

2036
02:23:51,901 --> 02:23:54,883
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're pretty good about... Those guys were great, but they were tucked away in the corner.

2037
02:23:55,224 --> 02:24:01,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they don't really have, like, the Kensha Hall syndrome that E3 has, where, like, oh, the weird stuff goes to Kensha Hall.

2038
02:24:01,530 --> 02:24:02,330
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta go to the basement.

2039
02:24:02,350 --> 02:24:03,011
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

2040
02:24:04,637 --> 02:24:09,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I never actually made my way over to the PAX 10, so I can't say whether that was actually good or not.

2041
02:24:09,972 --> 02:24:11,637
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I hear, it was okay, at the very least.

2042
02:24:12,967 --> 02:24:14,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so much swag from PAX.

2043
02:24:14,227 --> 02:24:15,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I got three different shirts.

2044
02:24:15,668 --> 02:24:17,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bunch of Rockstar stickers.

2045
02:24:17,449 --> 02:24:18,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, what else did I get?

2046
02:24:18,869 --> 02:24:25,152
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't actually manage to get one of those energy drink samples, which I don't know if you went by there, that energy drink booth that was kind of packed away in the corner.

2047
02:24:25,752 --> 02:24:30,994
[SPEAKER_01]: You thought they were giving away free cans of their drink, but it was really like, I don't know, a hundred empty cans just sitting on the table.

2048
02:24:32,254 --> 02:24:35,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that one, and they want you to sign up to win a case or something.

2049
02:24:36,896 --> 02:24:39,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I did sign up, though, for the ECA, and they were giving out Balls Geek beer.

2050
02:24:41,325 --> 02:24:41,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

2051
02:24:41,785 --> 02:24:42,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see that.

2052
02:24:42,445 --> 02:24:43,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so good.

2053
02:24:43,766 --> 02:24:45,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Root beer with caffeine.

2054
02:24:46,766 --> 02:24:47,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

2055
02:24:47,846 --> 02:24:48,426
[SPEAKER_01]: That does sound good.

2056
02:24:48,867 --> 02:24:50,127
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did I see?

2057
02:24:50,147 --> 02:24:53,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't manage to actually play any of the games that had a gigantic line, like LittleBigPlanet.

2058
02:24:53,227 --> 02:24:54,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of stayed away from those.

2059
02:24:55,408 --> 02:24:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you missed out.

2060
02:24:56,188 --> 02:24:57,528
[SPEAKER_03]: LittleBigPlanet was great.

2061
02:24:58,008 --> 02:25:01,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, you know, we were a little spoiled since we got to go in a little bit early.

2062
02:25:01,249 --> 02:25:02,449
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there wasn't a line for it.

2063
02:25:02,729 --> 02:25:04,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to get walked through by the U.S.

2064
02:25:04,390 --> 02:25:04,810
[SPEAKER_03]: producer.

2065
02:25:05,350 --> 02:25:08,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, I was spoiled, but, man, so worth it.

2066
02:25:09,311 --> 02:25:10,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about LittleBigPlanet now.

2067
02:25:12,950 --> 02:25:15,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have expected the Sonic RPG to be horrible.

2068
02:25:15,573 --> 02:25:22,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I went by the Sega booth, which took me a little while to find at first until I realized that there was a gigantic Sega sign.

2069
02:25:23,002 --> 02:25:25,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know we didn't even realize Sega was there until day two?

2070
02:25:27,441 --> 02:25:30,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they didn't exactly, like, there weren't any Sega signs, like, on the booth itself.

2071
02:25:30,563 --> 02:25:39,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the giant Sega sign hanging from the ceiling, and you wouldn't really notice that unless you were a really far distance away, and by that point, you may have gotten distracted by tons of other booths.

2072
02:25:39,610 --> 02:25:44,154
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going toward the Sega booth, and they're like, ooh, Afro Samurai, I should play that, which is also great.

2073
02:25:44,174 --> 02:25:45,795
[SPEAKER_05]: That game was hot.

2074
02:25:46,912 --> 02:25:50,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the Little Red Riding Hood Killing the Zombies game.

2075
02:25:50,514 --> 02:25:51,134
[SPEAKER_05]: That was hot too.

2076
02:25:51,154 --> 02:25:51,795
[SPEAKER_03]: That was funny.

2077
02:25:52,215 --> 02:25:59,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Rob D, we've got to wrap it up here because we can probably get one more call, but quickly, best thing about PAX and worst thing about PAX?

2078
02:26:00,819 --> 02:26:02,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Best thing about PAX, the people, without question.

2079
02:26:02,780 --> 02:26:13,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the con, I like the exhibitors hall, but actually being able to see everyone and talk with the people that I've been chatting with over the last few years was just really just made for an unparalleled experience at any con I've been to.

2080
02:26:13,906 --> 02:26:14,926
[SPEAKER_03]: The worst thing, the amount of people.

2081
02:26:16,857 --> 02:26:18,299
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of people, by far.

2082
02:26:18,740 --> 02:26:21,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't actually make it into any panel without waiting at least an hour in line.

2083
02:26:22,785 --> 02:26:27,050
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I saw how long the lines were, I didn't even try.

2084
02:26:29,253 --> 02:26:31,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Something was going to have to be done about that for next year.

2085
02:26:31,697 --> 02:26:33,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what, but they'll think of something fair.

2086
02:26:34,482 --> 02:26:34,802
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

2087
02:26:35,162 --> 02:26:36,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they'll get to organize it better.

2088
02:26:36,743 --> 02:26:38,124
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll figure out how to organize it better.

2089
02:26:38,144 --> 02:26:45,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the fact is that they've only had five years, which isn't really a long amount of time for any con, especially when they've been in the Seattle Convention Center for, I think, two years.

2090
02:26:45,627 --> 02:26:45,827
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

2091
02:26:45,988 --> 02:26:46,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.

2092
02:26:46,628 --> 02:26:47,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a whole sixth floor.

2093
02:26:47,768 --> 02:26:49,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet they're going to have to open it next year.

2094
02:26:49,109 --> 02:26:49,429
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

2095
02:26:49,449 --> 02:26:50,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for taking my call.

2096
02:26:50,890 --> 02:26:51,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what was going on?

2097
02:26:51,610 --> 02:26:54,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Gender Odyssey was going on at the same time we were there.

2098
02:26:54,712 --> 02:26:55,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

2099
02:26:55,232 --> 02:26:58,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they kind of kept that on the down low, which is probably a good idea with...

2100
02:26:59,654 --> 02:27:02,457
[SPEAKER_01]: with how immature gamers can be on occasion.

2101
02:27:02,577 --> 02:27:07,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't have cared, you know, heck, with all the years I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show, I've seen everything.

2102
02:27:07,822 --> 02:27:12,406
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think it's kind of interesting how segregated they kept the two.

2103
02:27:12,887 --> 02:27:13,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

2104
02:27:13,747 --> 02:27:15,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Rob D., thanks for the call.

2105
02:27:15,349 --> 02:27:15,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, buddy.

2106
02:27:16,310 --> 02:27:16,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And good to meet you.

2107
02:27:16,850 --> 02:27:17,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, you too.

2108
02:27:17,451 --> 02:27:19,113
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next year, right?

2109
02:27:20,033 --> 02:27:20,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully.

2110
02:27:20,634 --> 02:27:20,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2111
02:27:21,615 --> 02:27:22,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Work on it.

2112
02:27:22,115 --> 02:27:22,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Save your pennies now.

2113
02:27:22,976 --> 02:27:23,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, see ya.

2114
02:27:24,585 --> 02:27:26,607
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm going to have to do is start saving now.

2115
02:27:27,087 --> 02:27:29,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can fit in one more call.

2116
02:27:29,289 --> 02:27:32,592
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2117
02:27:33,092 --> 02:27:35,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I think after one more call we should be good here.

2118
02:27:36,875 --> 02:27:37,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2119
02:27:37,936 --> 02:27:38,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2120
02:27:39,137 --> 02:27:41,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Guy, and Blade 3.

2121
02:27:43,241 --> 02:27:43,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Blade 3.

2122
02:27:43,981 --> 02:27:44,882
[SPEAKER_03]: What is on your mind, Blade 3?

2123
02:27:46,203 --> 02:27:46,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

2124
02:27:46,603 --> 02:27:47,825
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of late where I am.

2125
02:27:48,485 --> 02:27:48,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you?

2126
02:27:49,226 --> 02:27:49,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you on the East Coast?

2127
02:27:50,667 --> 02:27:51,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's 12.

2128
02:27:52,586 --> 02:27:55,747
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, it's way past everyone's bedtime over there, but that's all right.

2129
02:27:55,767 --> 02:27:57,348
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to wrap up the show so y'all can go to bed.

2130
02:27:58,028 --> 02:27:58,509
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

2131
02:27:58,529 --> 02:27:59,649
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you call in about tonight?

2132
02:28:00,630 --> 02:28:08,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just wanted to tell Loki, because I'm sure he's still listening, that I figured out my own coding for my website.

2133
02:28:09,413 --> 02:28:11,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you sent us an email wanting Loki's source code.

2134
02:28:12,595 --> 02:28:12,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

2135
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:13,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I made my own.

2136
02:28:42,304 --> 02:28:48,869
[SPEAKER_07]: and you can check it out at mmtsp.tk Nice, I love that he's working in a plug.

2137
02:28:49,429 --> 02:28:51,331
[SPEAKER_03]: What will I find on this wonderful PSP site?

2138
02:28:52,832 --> 02:28:55,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now it's in a semi-beta.

2139
02:28:57,475 --> 02:29:02,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically there's just one page and it just has links to other pages but nothing on them so far.

2140
02:29:03,620 --> 02:29:05,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well you gotta start somewhere.

2141
02:29:06,418 --> 02:29:14,983
[SPEAKER_07]: By the end of the week, I should have quite a few demos, some DVDs, some funny videos, and some soundtracks from games.

2142
02:29:15,863 --> 02:29:16,684
[SPEAKER_03]: One more thing.

2143
02:29:16,744 --> 02:29:21,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making a PSP site as an add-on to my regular site, and my regular site is masterman.pk.

2144
02:29:35,745 --> 02:29:36,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Plug, plug, plug, plug.

2145
02:29:36,990 --> 02:29:39,358
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're going to start charging 50 bucks a plug.

2146
02:29:39,820 --> 02:29:40,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know.

2147
02:29:40,502 --> 02:29:41,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, best of luck with your sites, buddy.

2148
02:29:42,881 --> 02:29:43,121
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2149
02:29:43,181 --> 02:29:43,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

2150
02:29:43,861 --> 02:29:44,141
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2151
02:29:45,042 --> 02:29:47,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of our listeners need to go visit these sites.

2152
02:29:47,042 --> 02:29:49,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're terrible, I want you to tear this guy apart.

2153
02:29:49,323 --> 02:29:49,823
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

2154
02:29:49,843 --> 02:29:50,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

2155
02:29:50,183 --> 02:29:50,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

2156
02:29:50,503 --> 02:29:51,343
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to start somewhere.

2157
02:29:51,824 --> 02:29:54,064
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all about supporting the independents and new ideas.

2158
02:29:54,104 --> 02:29:56,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, PSP sites aren't really getting enough love.

2159
02:29:56,685 --> 02:29:58,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sure, there's a few sites out there.

2160
02:29:58,505 --> 02:30:00,286
[SPEAKER_03]: But, man, that's a whole universe.

2161
02:30:00,326 --> 02:30:02,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really being explored as well as it could be.

2162
02:30:02,767 --> 02:30:03,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So someday.

2163
02:30:03,807 --> 02:30:04,407
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2164
02:30:04,427 --> 02:30:05,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2165
02:30:05,767 --> 02:30:06,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for those who didn't get through.

2166
02:30:06,748 --> 02:30:09,228
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

2167
02:30:09,268 --> 02:30:10,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Give Jamie some work to do next week.

2168
02:30:11,462 --> 02:30:12,183
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2169
02:30:28,511 --> 02:30:29,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

2170
02:30:29,152 --> 02:30:32,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a sale that was only for this weekend?

2171
02:30:33,376 --> 02:30:34,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe so.

2172
02:30:34,717 --> 02:30:35,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

2173
02:30:35,878 --> 02:30:39,742
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mass Effect went down to 300 points of Bring Down the Sky.

2174
02:30:40,282 --> 02:30:42,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Lost Odyssey triple bonus pack went to 120.

2175
02:30:43,265 --> 02:30:50,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Forza Motorsport 2, the Motegi track pack, and the September, December, March car packs went down to 240 each.

2176
02:30:52,293 --> 02:31:19,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Oblivion, Elder Scrolls 4, Shivering Isles went to $1,600 Guitar Hero 3, Def Leppard, Foo Fighters, Classic Rock Trackpacks to $360 Beautiful Katamari, the accessory ABCD set went to $120 Special accessory as well, Just Size stage went to $120 And the Big Ten 11 stages went to $140 So that's it Alright, I like sales, I like cheap things

2177
02:31:20,529 --> 02:31:23,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I do have a last minute story real quick.

2178
02:31:23,673 --> 02:31:25,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to do with the Max Payne movie.

2179
02:31:25,135 --> 02:31:26,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw sent me this one.

2180
02:31:26,377 --> 02:31:27,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember reading about this earlier in the week.

2181
02:31:27,899 --> 02:31:28,940
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't make our show roll though.

2182
02:31:29,301 --> 02:31:32,925
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently the Max Payne movie has been rated R and not happy.

2183
02:31:33,526 --> 02:31:35,369
[SPEAKER_03]: John Moore, the director of the movie, is pissed.

2184
02:31:35,869 --> 02:31:37,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to be a PG-13 movie.

2185
02:31:38,552 --> 02:31:40,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping he's lobbying the MPAA.

2186
02:31:40,653 --> 02:31:41,754
[SPEAKER_03]: What a bunch of fuckwads.

2187
02:32:00,422 --> 02:32:01,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible what they've done.

2188
02:32:02,724 --> 02:32:09,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the MPAA has slapped an R on this movie, which means it's not going to be able to be seen by teenagers.

2189
02:32:09,029 --> 02:32:09,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, who knows?

2190
02:32:09,569 --> 02:32:10,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it really is for the best.

2191
02:32:11,251 --> 02:32:12,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we have blurred the lines too much.

2192
02:32:13,272 --> 02:32:15,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Max Payne, I would definitely put an R on that.

2193
02:32:15,714 --> 02:32:19,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently, though, he actually, he did try to dumb it down a little bit.

2194
02:32:19,957 --> 02:32:22,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, he actually kind of cut out some of the language.

2195
02:32:23,879 --> 02:32:25,000
[SPEAKER_03]: No heads are cut off.

2196
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:27,122
[SPEAKER_03]: No eyeballs are ripped out or any of that stuff.

2197
02:32:27,162 --> 02:32:35,827
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually did tame it down a bit to try and get the PG-13 and still got the R. So he was kind of miffed about that, as you can understand.

2198
02:32:36,068 --> 02:32:36,588
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing.

2199
02:32:36,648 --> 02:32:44,253
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually goes so far as to say, they gave the Dark Knight a PG-13 rating and basically sucked Warner Brothers' cock.

2200
02:32:44,733 --> 02:32:45,494
[SPEAKER_03]: His words, not mine.

2201
02:32:46,636 --> 02:32:48,260
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, it's something to think about.

2202
02:32:48,521 --> 02:32:50,525
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dark Knight was a pretty dark film too.

2203
02:32:52,510 --> 02:32:54,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it just goes to show the MPAA is fucked.

2204
02:32:57,868 --> 02:32:59,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire em all, that's what I say

2205
02:33:25,814 --> 02:33:31,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Quotipo does say though, and I think this is interesting, I'd be more willing to see an R-rated Max Payne than a PG-13 version.

2206
02:33:32,841 --> 02:33:38,307
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw says, here's the thing, the first Mortal Kombat movie was PG-13, even though it was based on an M-rated game.

2207
02:33:38,707 --> 02:33:41,410
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie wins you back because of all the kick-ass fight sequences.

2208
02:33:41,950 --> 02:33:42,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, something to think about.

2209
02:33:44,238 --> 02:33:45,879
[SPEAKER_03]: So, lots of good points made by everybody.

2210
02:33:46,619 --> 02:33:49,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2211
02:33:49,501 --> 02:33:51,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thanks you guys for sticking with us tonight.

2212
02:33:51,742 --> 02:33:54,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself and DarkSakura holding down the fort.

2213
02:33:54,904 --> 02:33:59,386
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very lovely having you all in chat tonight to help fill in as our third host tonight.

2214
02:33:59,426 --> 02:34:01,527
[SPEAKER_03]: We always love having you guys on the program.

2215
02:34:01,547 --> 02:34:01,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.

2216
02:34:03,288 --> 02:34:05,970
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.

2217
02:34:06,970 --> 02:34:07,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts.

2218
02:34:07,931 --> 02:34:09,031
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2219
02:34:10,112 --> 02:34:10,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Poop!

2220
02:34:13,419 --> 02:34:15,960
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is fart.

2221
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:18,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, no, no.

2222
02:34:18,321 --> 02:34:19,841
[SPEAKER_05]: You said fart, so I have to say dick.

2223
02:34:20,181 --> 02:34:20,541
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2224
02:34:22,562 --> 02:34:24,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some other final thoughts from chat.

2225
02:34:24,202 --> 02:34:24,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaq Fu.

2226
02:34:25,102 --> 02:34:26,063
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good final thought.

2227
02:34:27,103 --> 02:34:28,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Your Shaq Fu moment of the day.

2228
02:34:28,783 --> 02:34:29,103
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2229
02:34:29,583 --> 02:34:30,184
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it.

2230
02:34:30,224 --> 02:34:36,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys, thank you so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting like Orange Lounge Radio, where dick and fart jokes are still okay.

2231
02:34:36,925 --> 02:34:37,765
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't sold out yet.

2232
02:34:38,326 --> 02:34:39,866
[SPEAKER_04]: What about boob and burp jokes?

2233
02:34:40,046 --> 02:34:41,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Boob and Burp jokes are always welcome.

2234
02:34:41,928 --> 02:34:46,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for supporting us and leaving us the nice things you have been on iTunes lately.

2235
02:34:46,052 --> 02:34:47,634
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a couple people that added reviews.

2236
02:34:47,654 --> 02:34:49,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for your kind reviews.

2237
02:34:49,756 --> 02:34:51,598
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd always appreciate a few more five-star reviews.

2238
02:34:51,678 --> 02:34:52,699
[SPEAKER_03]: It really helps out our ranking.

2239
02:34:53,140 --> 02:34:56,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, as we get bumped up in the rankings, we're more visible.

2240
02:34:56,963 --> 02:34:59,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you can't do that, just tell a couple friends about the show.

2241
02:34:59,246 --> 02:34:59,907
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we ask.

2242
02:34:59,987 --> 02:35:02,209
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our superpower is extra visibility.

2243
02:35:02,749 --> 02:35:03,209
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.

2244
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:03,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Word of mouth.

2245
02:35:04,130 --> 02:35:04,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And how.

2246
02:35:04,770 --> 02:35:05,931
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no magazine.

2247
02:35:06,251 --> 02:35:08,352
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no corporate funded website.

2248
02:35:08,412 --> 02:35:10,313
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't sell ads.

2249
02:35:10,653 --> 02:35:11,634
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the word of mouth.

2250
02:35:11,914 --> 02:35:12,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So we appreciate it.

2251
02:35:12,755 --> 02:35:14,616
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do sell my virtual body on the internet.

2252
02:35:15,076 --> 02:35:15,556
