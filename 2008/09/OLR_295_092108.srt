1
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:25,702
[SPEAKER_06]: September 21, 2008 Warcraft's expansion finally gets a release date, could Metal Slug get re-released in high definition, and Animal Crossing undergoes a strange name change overseas.

2
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

3
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:35,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:42,931
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:48,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We always tape live on Sunday nights at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on allgames.com.

6
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:50,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight.

7
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,263
[SPEAKER_02]: The show before us, the Bobby Blackwell Show, ran over just a smidge, but that's kind of our fault.

8
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:57,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

9
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:20,588
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.

10
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:21,328
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened?

11
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:27,329
[SPEAKER_11]: When it got a little bit cooler here, the wind picked up and blew all of the pollen around.

12
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:32,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And, well, I'm very prone to sinus infections, and I'm trying to fight off one.

13
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,591
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you need?

14
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:36,451
[SPEAKER_02]: A SARS mask.

15
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:37,391
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I need?

16
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:37,731
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

17
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:38,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Power thirst.

18
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:41,692
[SPEAKER_11]: It's made from lightning.

19
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:42,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

20
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:45,292
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

21
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:48,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So also say hello to the one and only Tech Master Loki.

22
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:48,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

23
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:51,535
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:19,245
[SPEAKER_13]: and LimeMutterPluckinB is the name of the guy that does it.

25
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:20,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Unique.

26
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:24,547
[SPEAKER_13]: They all flow together, each song, so that's why part of the song is on another track.

27
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:26,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha, because I was like, why is that song cut off?

28
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:26,848
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

29
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:29,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but it's one of those CDs that transitions from song to song.

30
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:29,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

31
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:30,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

32
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:32,490
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

33
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Ragnarok

34
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:02,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragnarok 2 Ragnarok 2

35
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:26,356
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

36
00:03:26,396 --> 00:03:28,278
[SPEAKER_11]: So, no, no, not three.

37
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:37,363
[SPEAKER_11]: It was about, no, it was about a, no, it was about two years that I played the beta because I started on the first closed beta, I think.

38
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:38,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Or before, no?

39
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:39,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the first closed beta.

40
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,318
[SPEAKER_02]: So a long time.

41
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:41,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

42
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So, wow, jeez.

43
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry if you haven't tried to get in on that beta, but I guess the whole, this is something about you have to have a Korean equivalent of a social security number to get in.

44
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:53,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I also looked more into it, and the only thing that I'm really interested in it is the soundtrack.

45
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,007
[SPEAKER_11]: It's by Yoko Kanno.

46
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:56,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

47
00:03:56,988 --> 00:04:03,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, as soon as I can find a reliable way to give it a go, I might try, but for right now, there's emulated ways.

48
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:04,593
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fair enough.

49
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:08,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if that's it for your gaming week, then Loki, how was your gaming week?

50
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,060
[SPEAKER_13]: It was alright.

51
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:12,963
[SPEAKER_13]: I played not a whole lot this week.

52
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:15,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Mainly three things.

53
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:16,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Grand Theft Auto 4, of course.

54
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:22,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Trying to keep on my winning streak, but there was a day that I let it get away from me for a game or so.

55
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,592
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's back now, so I'm still on my winning streak.

56
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:29,834
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I played...

57
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:32,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Some more of Mercenaries 2.

58
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:35,582
[SPEAKER_13]: And I swear, the more I play that game, the more broken it gets.

59
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:40,548
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's kind of entertaining just to see how bad the glitching will get.

60
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,794
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm about a third of the way through it now.

61
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:46,717
[SPEAKER_13]: And then...

62
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,604
[SPEAKER_13]: I also played Pure, which is pretty fun.

63
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:53,425
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an ATV off-road racing game.

64
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:57,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of a little similar to Excite Truck, sort of.

65
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Controls aren't exactly as tight as Excite Truck.

66
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:03,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's a little bit more realistic.

67
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:09,151
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, a lot of flying through the air and doing tricks and stuff like that.

68
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,451
[SPEAKER_13]: And lots of nitrous, so it's fun.

69
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:15,773
[SPEAKER_13]: But, yeah, that's pretty much it so far.

70
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:18,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, my gaming week.

71
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:20,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played something new this week.

72
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:23,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out and got a copy of Warhammer Online.

73
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:27,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided I was going to take the plunge and go ahead and start playing another MMO.

74
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and grabbed myself a copy of Warhammer Online.

75
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:33,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I don't know, MMOs are really hard to evaluate.

76
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:39,355
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it takes a long time because there's so much depth to them that they can take a long time to evaluate.

77
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:42,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not really sure what my full opinion of Warhammer Online is.

78
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:44,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still playing it, so that must be a good sign, right?

79
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:46,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend of mine quit after playing it for...

80
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Warhammer feels really clunky to me.

81
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:10,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Really clunky.

82
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,058
[SPEAKER_02]: There seems to be delay in some of the things I do.

83
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:23,326
[SPEAKER_02]: You could blame my computer's performance, but seeing as I just got a new quad-core 6GB RAM computer, I don't think it's necessarily the computer's specs that are slowing it down.

84
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:24,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

85
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:28,092
[SPEAKER_02]: The interface feels a little clunky to me.

86
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:35,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so bad that the game really suffers because I still will play it and everything, but it's a little bit clunky to me.

87
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:41,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, sometimes I find the interface to be messy, but it's highly, highly customizable, which is cool.

88
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really encourage people to customize this.

89
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:43,853
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

90
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:46,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things I do like about the game now.

91
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:52,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the way the game seems to be split off into these three different areas.

92
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,461
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your PvE stuff, which feels pretty much like Warcraft.

93
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:04,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to guy with exclamation point overhead, or in this case, little book with green book.

94
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:08,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Get quest, go do quest, turn in quest.

95
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:10,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very similar to...

96
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:12,710
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

97
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:33,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for instance, one of the Realm vs. Realm things I got into was this thing where it's, for those that have played Warcraft, it's very similar to a Rothy Basin, but you only have two nodes.

98
00:07:33,105 --> 00:07:36,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those that are playing Warhammer, I'm describing them canes and brace.

99
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:36,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's how you say it.

100
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:42,752
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's kind of cool about it, what I really liked is that, okay, so you have, you know, the order and you have chaos.

101
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:45,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're trying to capture both the nodes.

102
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:52,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And when one team captures both nodes, what's really cool is that it sets off this giant, like, alarm, like you hear a ROAR

103
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

104
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:08,571
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

105
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,187
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

106
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:49,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Warhammer Public Quests

107
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,351
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

108
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:28,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Beastmaster has a pair of ferrets

109
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,489
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he does not have a pair of ferrets.

110
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,232
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the Beastmaster over a dragon.

111
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,616
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a ferret Beastmaster later in the game.

112
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:00,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

113
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:02,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they called Kodo and Podo?

114
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:02,801
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

115
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

116
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:28,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's still a lot more of this game for me to explore.

117
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:30,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And the MMO is early.

118
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:40,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So while I might be criticizing the graphical interface and these sorts of things early on, there's going to be patches that will probably fix a lot of the stuff that bugs us.

119
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:44,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's face it, pretty much any MMO has a lot of issues when it first launches.

120
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:47,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another reason why I'm like, I can't really...

121
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:52,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Review this game in full yet because it still has a long way to grow and develop.

122
00:10:53,021 --> 00:11:00,087
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say this, if you're a PvPer, you really like the player versus player stuff, I think you're really going to enjoy Warhammer.

123
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:04,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're more of a PvE type person, there's something worth checking out here for you.

124
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:09,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm usually not a big PvPer, but I thought it was set up enough where I didn't feel like...

125
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wasting my time, if that makes sense.

126
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having a good time and I was enjoying the game.

127
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what it comes down to.

128
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do recommend, if you like MMOs, check out Warhammer online.

129
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,081
[SPEAKER_02]: At least do your research, check into it, see if it's something you like.

130
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:33,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, there's no trial for it, really, and I think that's one thing they're severely lacking and they need to get up and running in the next 60 days, is get a trial for the people who really want to check out what this game's all about.

131
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:34,212
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

132
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:55,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not at all interested in Warhammer.

133
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not really a big, big MMO player.

134
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:01,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you play Ragnarok, but you haven't enjoyed a lot of the other MMOs you've played.

135
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:02,998
[SPEAKER_02]: But Star Trek Online's coming out.

136
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:03,838
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different.

137
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:04,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a space one.

138
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:10,164
[SPEAKER_11]: But actually, I liked World of Warcraft until it turned out that it just wasn't worth my time.

139
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:11,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

140
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,928
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't play MMOs right now.

141
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:17,952
[SPEAKER_13]: And even when my wife joins Warcraft, I may not.

142
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:18,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Do that.

143
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:19,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

144
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:23,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Although when APB comes around, we'll talk again.

145
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well that's it for my gaming week.

146
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:28,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, just pretty much Rock Band 2 and games you've heard me talk about before.

147
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:32,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

148
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:35,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And tonight for housekeeping, Loki wants to talk about OLRPSP.com.

149
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was just going to say that I have a thread up in our forum right now.

150
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:44,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, allowing you guys to submit...

151
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:59,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Banners, because if you notice on the OLR PSP All Games Radio Player, that there's a little banner that keeps repeating, and you'll probably have noticed that there's only three of them, one including a banner for the PAX coverage, which is way old now.

152
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:06,031
[SPEAKER_13]: So we need more banners, and it's real easy, pretty much you can make a banner for...

153
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:14,031
[SPEAKER_13]: either one of the shows on the network, one of the inside jokes, something funny like one of the PSAs.

154
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:14,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Just anything.

155
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Just pretty much anything that's kind of show-related or network-related.

156
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:21,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Or indie production-related.

157
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:22,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

158
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:26,354
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically just 296 pixels by 32.

159
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:29,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is it such a weird-ass banner size?

160
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:31,016
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just the size I made it.

161
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:31,436
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

162
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:31,836
[SPEAKER_13]: And...

163
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,990
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

164
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,051
[SPEAKER_13]: And all the details are on our forums.

165
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:40,633
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can post your images there or email them to me.

166
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,815
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they're decent, then we'll throw them up there.

167
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:48,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the awesome, awesome OLRPSP.com.

168
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:53,039
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see this in action on that great all-games radio tuner on the PSP.

169
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

170
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

171
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:55,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

172
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:15,359
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for more stuff.

173
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,420
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need some stuff.

174
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you're going to hear a lot in tonight's free break because I don't want to recycle the same old crap over and over again.

175
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:23,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, I didn't have time to create anything new today.

176
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:26,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really rely on you guys for some of the extra stuff.

177
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:28,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Just send me an email or post on the forums.

178
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,090
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all that cool stuff on there.

179
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Redertainment is in chat, reading some comments from chat.

180
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,955
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, I have the latest version of the PSP hardware.

181
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:40,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to download the all-games player on olrpsp.com and it didn't work.

182
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on what might be going on?

183
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:42,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

184
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:44,679
[SPEAKER_13]: It should work.

185
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:47,660
[SPEAKER_13]: You just put it in this... It's probably the directory that you have it in.

186
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,321
[SPEAKER_13]: You probably set it in the wrong directory.

187
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:55,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Try downloading the official radio players off of Sony's website.

188
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:58,685
[SPEAKER_13]: If those work for you, then I don't know.

189
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:01,886
[SPEAKER_13]: But all you have to do is put them in the same directory as those and they'll work just fine.

190
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:05,507
[SPEAKER_02]: But you test on the latest PSP firmwares as they're released, right?

191
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:07,448
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but...

192
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:13,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Then again, it shouldn't matter though because they don't remove anything from the PSP firmwares.

193
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:22,231
[SPEAKER_13]: To be honest, I don't have any legitimate firmwares, but it doesn't matter because they're the exact same thing plus other added bonuses.

194
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:27,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read this comment from earlier, because I'm not sure if it's on the right track or not.

195
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaoran said, Jamie also has bad memories involving things like Warhammer, right?

196
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:34,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that true or not?

197
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:37,825
[SPEAKER_11]: The Warhammer with the little models, yeah.

198
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:38,665
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

199
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:42,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I had an ex who would play Warhammer to the exclusion of all else.

200
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:44,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Yikes.

201
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:46,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would have to sit and paint his models.

202
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that he's gotten sucked into this thing beyond belief at this point?

203
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:51,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I don't know.

204
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:53,216
[SPEAKER_11]: This is 12 years ago in Alabama.

205
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:56,287
[SPEAKER_02]: That was worth asking.

206
00:15:57,568 --> 00:15:58,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care what happened.

207
00:15:58,549 --> 00:15:59,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it Warhammer or Warhammer 40,000?

208
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,931
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Warhammer 40k.

209
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:09,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, my review comes from somebody who has never touched a Warhammer model or done any of that stuff.

210
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I did get vengeance on him once.

211
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:12,779
[SPEAKER_02]: How so?

212
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:18,543
[SPEAKER_11]: He had some sort of big figure that was like this hulking creature and I painted it hot pink.

213
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:20,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

214
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:21,905
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty cool.

215
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:22,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

216
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:23,924
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

217
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also pretty cool, some video game news.

218
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:28,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, start us off tonight, would you?

219
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:29,847
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

220
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:41,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this time, I mean, I think we may have talked about this a little bit before, but Rock Revolution, as if you needed more reasons why it's not going to be that great.

221
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:51,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Konami says that they're not actually going to put out any guitars for it, so you're going to need to find your own guitars, whether that be a Guitar Hero guitar, a Rock Band guitar, a third-party guitar.

222
00:16:52,759 --> 00:17:02,010
[SPEAKER_13]: you're just going to need another guitar because if you don't own a music game and for some reason you decide this is the one you want to start off with well all you're going to be able to get is just the drums and that's it.

223
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:03,358
[SPEAKER_13]: No guitars for you.

224
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:42,890
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing is, they're just not going to make a guitar whatsoever, and that's fine if they don't want to do it, but I've had Konami reps before tell me, oh, we're not in the peripheral business, but yet you have peripherals bundled with your DDR bundles, so you're a liar, basically.

225
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:50,035
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, they're not trying to be in the peripheral business, yet they're making a game with peripherals, so they're kind of...

226
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:54,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, plus the fact that it's not like Konami's never made a guitar controller before.

227
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:56,349
[SPEAKER_02]: They just didn't do it here.

228
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:58,470
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably they just don't want to make another one.

229
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:07,474
[SPEAKER_13]: They probably have reasons, and it's maybe something to do with the fact that they've licensed out their design for guitars to other companies or something.

230
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:12,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe there's something legal that we don't see yet.

231
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:17,579
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's part of the lawsuit or something, and that's why they didn't do it, and that's why they only did drum controller.

232
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:35,995
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking that's got to be the reason, because if you notice, the drum controllers that they have out there, they're not exactly rip-offs of the original Drum Mania controller, except for Konami's, which is obviously, it looks like kind of a rip-off of the original Drum Mania controller, but they can do that since it's theirs.

233
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,895
[SPEAKER_11]: And it sucked, for the record.

234
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:45,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so that's my thing, is that maybe these people are paying to license these guitars or something, and

235
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,361
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, a non-compete thing or something?

236
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:49,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

237
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:10,169
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

238
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:34,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think it's also, you know, the guitar not included.

239
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:37,770
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even remember if they have vocals in this as well.

240
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:44,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they... No, they don't have vocals in it before they were going to, but they axed it, it looks like.

241
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:57,582
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just a guitar and drums, and... I don't know, I don't think it's a big deal, because shit, you can buy used guitars, like used Guitar Hero 2 guitars for like $12, so... It doesn't really matter, but...

242
00:19:59,437 --> 00:19:59,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

243
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:00,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

244
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:01,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Do what they want to do.

245
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:02,239
[SPEAKER_13]: The game's going to suck anyways.

246
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,501
[SPEAKER_13]: You sure?

247
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:07,904
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, having not played it, what's your basis for this?

248
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:09,586
[SPEAKER_13]: My basis for it is it looks cheap.

249
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:11,688
[SPEAKER_13]: All the videos I've seen from it look cheap.

250
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:14,130
[SPEAKER_13]: All the gameplay from it I've seen looks very cheap.

251
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,272
[SPEAKER_13]: It just looks like a cheap knockoff.

252
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:21,296
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's sad because they were the ones that pioneered this, but it's just a cheap knockoff.

253
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:30,265
[SPEAKER_11]: What their problem was is they did it right to start with in Japan, but they didn't realize that their American user base would be interested in the same stuff too.

254
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:32,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So they started way too late.

255
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:39,515
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll quote Bobby that one of the icons for the drum is actually a dark gray.

256
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:41,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

257
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:42,758
[SPEAKER_13]: That's retarded.

258
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:44,048
[SPEAKER_13]: What were you thinking?

259
00:20:44,268 --> 00:21:00,872
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I've said this on the show before, I don't know if I want to continue to beat a dead horse, but, you know, in a way, if Konami is going to assume, you know, what happens about assuming that this stuff is not going to take off in America, you know, then they have no one to blame but themselves for what's happening now.

260
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:11,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, and this sounds all conspiracy theory-like, but I really think that they're making this so that it doesn't do well, so that they can sue them, so they have reason to...

261
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:15,696
[SPEAKER_13]: to say, hey, look, your game is causing our game not to sell.

262
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:21,900
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think that that would fly in court and they know it.

263
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,581
[SPEAKER_11]: They'd have to know better.

264
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:33,366
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, let's see what you guys, the listeners, thought because OLR is the show where every... How long ago did they register any licenses for Guitar Freaks or Drum Mania over here?

265
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:35,368
[SPEAKER_02]: They did Guitar Revolution a while back.

266
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:37,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they also had an arcade release of Guitar Freaks here.

267
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:39,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's years old.

268
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if that would count for a console.

269
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:41,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

270
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:45,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Revolution, Drummer Revolution, Rock Revolution

271
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,864
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think it's been pretty well known now that yes, it's working with both.

272
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:14,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a yes.

273
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:18,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Picaruno says, hell no, because that's the answer I gave last time.

274
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:20,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess during the show we must have asked this before once.

275
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:26,632
[SPEAKER_02]: TheSag said, no, I enjoy the careful selection Harmonix practices in their setlist.

276
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,574
[SPEAKER_02]: They are game designers of music.

277
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of going back to the setlist.

278
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:33,877
[SPEAKER_02]: K. Rose says, I won't buy it.

279
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:36,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I only like Konami games for the Japanese music.

280
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,701
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's localized, I'll get a better rhythm band game like Rock Band.

281
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:45,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting perspective that, you know, they didn't bring over anything from Japan, so there are folks that like that.

282
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:49,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, I gotta say though, you're kind of a niche market in that case.

283
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:57,145
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it would be nice if somebody would release a game that has some of the US stuff and that, but you're never gonna see a game released over here that's all that.

284
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:59,126
[SPEAKER_13]: You wanna hear something else that's kind of retarded about this too?

285
00:22:59,146 --> 00:22:59,306
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

286
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:02,806
[SPEAKER_13]: The game only version of this is coming out in early October.

287
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:09,148
[SPEAKER_13]: The actual instruments, the drums, and those bundles aren't coming until like mid-November.

288
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:12,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Band 2 is the same way.

289
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:24,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they're just doing that now because they have the exclusive for it, but it's still stupid because if you want to try their unique drums or whatever, how many people are going to buy this game and just go, eh, whatever, I'm not going to buy the drums now.

290
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:25,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they're stuck with a bunch of drums.

291
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, going back to the Twitter question, are you going to buy Rock Revolution?

292
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:32,814
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 says, I'm too ghetto to bother shelling out the monies for it.

293
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:39,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says no, because Konami failed to do this years ago, and they should have, and they're not even offering something at the level of Rock Band Guitar Hero.

294
00:23:39,938 --> 00:23:44,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Goldanthro says no, because if I was going to spend the money for a game like that, I'd buy Guitar Hero or Rock Band.

295
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:50,104
[SPEAKER_02]: MarinMarvel says no, it's too little too late for Konami to try to jump back into the music game business in the US.

296
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:51,545
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already failed hardcore.

297
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:55,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin says, all covers in an archaic interface?

298
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:55,887
[SPEAKER_02]: No thank you.

299
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus the drums look like ass.

300
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:58,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami missed the boat years ago.

301
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:02,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I can never say this name.

302
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Giovedea?

303
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:07,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Giovedea, I think?

304
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:10,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lessons on how to pronounce it last week, but I already forgot.

305
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:12,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Giovedea.

306
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:15,935
[SPEAKER_02]: As DJ Ranma S said, only if it works with the stuff I already have.

307
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:20,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Javier Altman says, because we already have enough plastic instrument stuff.

308
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami is too late for their own good.

309
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,243
[SPEAKER_02]: The last Bossa da Santa has been played.

310
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:31,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Sponge Twang says, I will wait out most likely into next year after the dust has settled.

311
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to figure which plastic instruments work with which games.

312
00:24:34,252 --> 00:24:39,658
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Tyrant says, depends on how good the execution is since it's compatible with Rock Band 2 Guitar Hero gear.

313
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:42,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I might pick it up, but they are very late to the party.

314
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:49,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, Chad28 says, No, because they are mostly songs that have already been used in other Guitar Hero Rock Band games and no master tracks.

315
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:51,242
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

316
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:54,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

317
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:56,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah.

318
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:00,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So, alright, well, we'll see what happens.

319
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:04,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's really hard to make an ultimate decision until the game actually comes out.

320
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:07,027
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just, if you're unsure about it, just wait, because...

321
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:08,988
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

322
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,341
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

323
00:25:57,378 --> 00:26:03,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be interesting, especially if the timetable is stepped up for the releases, what this annual subscription model could do.

324
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:04,648
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

325
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the subscription model a good idea, a bad idea?

326
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's a good idea.

327
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:08,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

328
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:09,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you don't know what's coming out.

329
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:10,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's...

330
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:12,401
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of stupid.

331
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:15,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows what they're going to put out and what frequency it's going to be coming out as.

332
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:18,984
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there might be a lot of stuff that you're not really interested in.

333
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:30,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say you'd have... I think the better deal is the way that Rock Band's doing it where you have a bundle of songs you can pay for and if you want all of them, you get it at a buck cheaper or something like that.

334
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:39,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you can buy individual songs because if you pay, say, $60 a year or whatever for the subscription model or whatever, what if it's not worth it to you?

335
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:41,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, all these songs coming out...

336
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:42,955
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

337
00:27:01,514 --> 00:27:03,375
[SPEAKER_11]: What if they did something to that effect?

338
00:27:03,775 --> 00:27:07,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Where they say, this is our exclusive featured track, you can only get it this way.

339
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:11,098
[SPEAKER_11]: However, if you don't want it, then choose something else.

340
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:13,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and then also the other thing comes too.

341
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:20,583
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nice that they want to do this, but is this actual model built into Xbox Live Marketplace or PlayStation Network?

342
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:23,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we know PlayStation Network can do it because they obviously have...

343
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:26,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Their core subscription model, and you can pay for stuff that way.

344
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:27,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

345
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:30,146
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two MMOs on Xbox 360 that have subscription models.

346
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:32,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Phantasy Star Universe and Final Fantasy XI.

347
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but those are done through their own individual servers.

348
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:37,448
[SPEAKER_11]: But you still pay for it on Xbox Live.

349
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:38,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

350
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:42,529
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case of the Phantasy Star Universe, you actually pay for that on Xbox Live.

351
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got to be there.

352
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,691
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually have you input all of your billing information right before you can start.

353
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:52,215
[SPEAKER_02]: VX Jason XV comes up with an interesting point in chat.

354
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:56,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you don't know what music comes out in the real world either until it's about to or does.

355
00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:59,460
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fundamentally nothing different from actual music subscription services.

356
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,783
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, I mean, to kind of... But at the same time, though, it's not necessarily just...

357
00:28:06,204 --> 00:28:07,405
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, what are they going to do?

358
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:11,828
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to pay for this service to get access to all the download content?

359
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:13,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Or are you just going to get access to the new stuff?

360
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:30,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like, say if I'm on Rhapsody or, you know, Napster or whatever Napster's got to have, I mean, I'm just pulling this number out of my butt But Napster's got to have hundreds of thousands of songs on it Exactly, that's a little different thing And Guitar Hero has a bucket full, maybe Not a room full, you know what I mean?

361
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:32,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly, it's totally different

362
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:41,415
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well... Unless they're going to start pumping out, you know, 20 tracks a week or something like that, then that's different, but I don't think they are.

363
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:47,583
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I notice a lot of people are kind of turning their noses up as subscription models, but, I mean, that's pretty much how all MMOs work.

364
00:28:47,623 --> 00:28:49,786
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, the other thing you have to look at, too, is...

365
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:50,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

366
00:29:11,404 --> 00:29:18,810
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm thinking might work is sort of what I'm going back to what I was saying before about having the exclusive subscription only stuff.

367
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:31,640
[SPEAKER_11]: If they have like certain things that are available only through subscription and they have their regular bundle packs that everybody has access to but there's only certain really good stuff available to people who are in the fan club.

368
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:42,166
[SPEAKER_02]: What about like a, just kind of really going off wild here, what about like a Guitar Hero magazine or something, or a tie-in with a rock magazine or something that would come with a CD with bonus tracks?

369
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:49,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm thinking rock bands kind of done that, like the Xbox, what, official Xbox magazine had like three bonus songs on it at once, so you can only get there.

370
00:29:50,011 --> 00:29:52,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think they came out for download eventually, but a long time later.

371
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:58,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was the deal about buying the soundtrack that gave you the bonus songs.

372
00:29:59,198 --> 00:29:59,338
Hmm.

373
00:30:00,154 --> 00:30:01,294
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, we'll see.

374
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:02,035
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

375
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:05,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, new ideas, never a bad thing to try new things.

376
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:07,696
[SPEAKER_02]: The worst that can happen is you fall on your face and fail.

377
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:12,417
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully they'll still keep kind of both options available, but we'll see what happens.

378
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:12,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

379
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:17,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it looks like Activision's getting something right in the UK and Ireland.

380
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

381
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:47,461
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be the same Red Octane one that's the Guitar Hero 3 peripheral for PS3.

382
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:51,984
[SPEAKER_11]: This is UK only, just to reiterate.

383
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:55,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're saying that there's a release date early November.

384
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:00,929
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty interesting, I think.

385
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:08,134
[SPEAKER_11]: But it would be available to any retailer and consumers can pre-order either online or in-store.

386
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:09,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I want free stuff.

387
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fair.

388
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but they're giving them old guitars.

389
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:15,524
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's free!

390
00:31:16,304 --> 00:31:16,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

391
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:18,426
[SPEAKER_13]: I gave you a kick in the balls.

392
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:18,966
[SPEAKER_13]: It's free.

393
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:20,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to hell.

394
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:26,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but unlike a kick in the balls, which is somewhat entertaining... Sorry, Rob.

395
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:27,893
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you know?

396
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a girl.

397
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,315
[SPEAKER_11]: They're very entertaining to watch.

398
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:32,416
[SPEAKER_11]: And deliver.

399
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:36,079
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll never be the recipient of one.

400
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

401
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:39,410
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway...

402
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:46,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it's actually, first of all, it's a good way to get rid of some overstock if that's half of the case.

403
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:49,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Another way, I think you can never have too many peripherals.

404
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:50,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I love peripherals.

405
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:54,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a room in my house dedicated to peripherals.

406
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:56,327
[SPEAKER_02]: You are also a freak in that regard.

407
00:31:56,487 --> 00:31:57,348
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

408
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:58,308
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen the vault.

409
00:31:58,368 --> 00:31:59,829
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean that with love.

410
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:01,649
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know you are a freak in that regard.

411
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:06,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I won't even get the fucking drum set for Rock Band because I'm like, I just don't need any more shit in my house.

412
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:08,472
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have a whole room.

413
00:32:09,773 --> 00:32:10,673
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to get a vault, Rob.

414
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:11,746
[SPEAKER_02]: No vault.

415
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:12,667
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the vault.

416
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:17,209
[SPEAKER_02]: My freaking garage is now an internet radio station hub.

417
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:18,990
[SPEAKER_11]: There is room here for a drum kit.

418
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,370
[SPEAKER_11]: A real one.

419
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not want.

420
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:22,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball machine, yes.

421
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:23,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Drum kit, no.

422
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:24,772
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to buy our Black Knight?

423
00:32:24,992 --> 00:32:25,793
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

424
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:26,233
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm poor.

425
00:32:27,073 --> 00:32:30,455
[SPEAKER_13]: The Rock Band 2 drums are actually being delivered to my work on Wednesday.

426
00:32:30,535 --> 00:32:32,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Your wife is going to punch you in the face.

427
00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:34,437
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting rid of the old ones.

428
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,337
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm upgrading.

429
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:35,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

430
00:32:35,897 --> 00:32:36,958
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do with the old ones?

431
00:32:37,737 --> 00:32:39,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, give them to my sister, I think.

432
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:40,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

433
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:41,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

434
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, so some other interesting stuff about Guitar Hero, and I guess this is a little bit of trivia.

435
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:55,651
[SPEAKER_13]: The Metallica mix of their brand new album is actually better in Guitar Hero than it is on the actual CD.

436
00:32:55,812 --> 00:33:07,302
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, the new Death Magnet album has been mixed too loud, they say, and is actually sacrificing audio quality in favor of a louder sounding product.

437
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:08,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Well...

438
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:15,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero, on the other hand, is actually a little bit more balanced, so you actually have a little bit more depth in the audio in there.

439
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:20,175
[SPEAKER_13]: So a lot of people are thinking, hey, let's just rip the audio from Guitar Hero instead.

440
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, wouldn't this be a matter of opinion, though?

441
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:27,337
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they actually looked at the audio.

442
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,797
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually ran it through a...

443
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:38,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Waveform Editor, and it showed how they had it capped in there for the CD audio versus Guitar Hero.

444
00:33:38,454 --> 00:33:42,978
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually was significantly better on Guitar Hero.

445
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:47,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this one of those things that only crazy audiophiles would really notice?

446
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:51,026
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Joe Average Headbanger?

447
00:33:51,586 --> 00:33:58,389
[SPEAKER_13]: They may not care, but I actually did listen to some of the portions of it when they were comparing it.

448
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,670
[SPEAKER_13]: It does sound distorted.

449
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like someone just recorded it too loud.

450
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:03,192
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's Metallica!

451
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:04,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be loud!

452
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:05,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

453
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:07,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of expected it to be distorted.

454
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:10,735
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supposed to be loud, but you're supposed to turn up your radio.

455
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:10,915
[SPEAKER_13]: To 11!

456
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:15,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, you're not supposed to record it loud and then turn it up, because then it'll sound all fucked up.

457
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:18,931
[SPEAKER_13]: They should know this.

458
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:19,631
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, hell.

459
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:20,332
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, come on.

460
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:21,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitstun agrees.

461
00:34:21,052 --> 00:34:27,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitstun says the CD has mad clipping and Alpha Cananogram agrees it's too much clicking in our chatroom.

462
00:34:27,754 --> 00:34:29,255
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they should replace everyone's CDs.

463
00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:30,355
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my opinion.

464
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,735
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that bad?

465
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:32,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

466
00:34:32,756 --> 00:34:33,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should.

467
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess so.

468
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:41,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, especially when the CD, in some regard, the old-fashioned CD market is struggling to survive in a way.

469
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:44,079
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a pretty big screw-up in that regard.

470
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,560
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what you get for buying CDs.

471
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:47,648
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just telling you.

472
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:49,549
[SPEAKER_13]: See, this is what Metallica thinks of you.

473
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:50,569
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all, fuck you guys.

474
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,551
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to just re-record it all fucked up.

475
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Ha, you bought the CD.

476
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:54,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Now you're stuck, bitches.

477
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow I doubt that.

478
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:57,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Somehow I doubt that.

479
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:59,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Play rock band or guitar hero.

480
00:34:59,986 --> 00:35:08,469
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, look, if you want to play more Guitar Hero, especially Guitar Hero World Tour, you can use your rock band drums with Guitar Hero World Tour.

481
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:11,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And this story is kind of making the rounds of the blog, so I don't know.

482
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I already kind of knew some of this, but whatever.

483
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:14,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

484
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:25,395
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens if you use a rock band drum set in Guitar Hero World Tour, and this is kind of demonstrated at a World Tour preview event that happened earlier this week, what

485
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:38,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what will happen is that the pad that's all the way on the right on the five note chart will actually kind of go over to the other orange pad instead.

486
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:41,111
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes there will be some other logic as well.

487
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:45,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if there's already an orange note in there, it might actually move it to a blue note.

488
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:50,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is, it's not just necessarily eliminating the fifth one altogether.

489
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:54,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and I think that's kind of where this is kind of resurfacing in news reports.

490
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:58,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think the early things we thought is that that fifth one would just get eliminated altogether.

491
00:35:58,494 --> 00:36:01,714
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, those notes are going to get moved, basically, to other drops.

492
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:03,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is kind of neat, in a way.

493
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:05,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is also good for score comparison and everything.

494
00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:08,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it truly cape everything on the same page?

495
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:09,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what?

496
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:10,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this going to be an advantage?

497
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:14,834
[SPEAKER_02]: using one controller over the other because one's four and one's five.

498
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:16,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it matters.

499
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,996
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I'm not super duper into drums as well, right?

500
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:20,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

501
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:21,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

502
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:22,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

503
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:24,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

504
00:36:24,257 --> 00:36:28,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got sent a link to a YouTube that's supposed to compare the two Metallica tracks.

505
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,279
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hear it a little bit?

506
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:29,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

507
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:30,980
[SPEAKER_13]: I've already listened to it.

508
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,680
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's hear it.

509
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:39,443
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear right there how it's all... Let's see.

510
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:39,883
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

511
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you this is a radio show.

512
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:12,206
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't get to see what we saw on our screen, which would show you which clips were Guitar Hero and which clips were the CD.

513
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:13,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you people at home couldn't tell the difference.

514
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:20,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, this show is delivered at a lower bitrate, but I think this is one of those things.

515
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see it in the visuals, absolutely.

516
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:24,336
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see, look at the waveforms.

517
00:37:24,396 --> 00:37:26,098
[SPEAKER_02]: They absolutely look different.

518
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:28,299
[SPEAKER_02]: But I bet you guys couldn't tell the difference.

519
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:31,322
[SPEAKER_11]: But what's the audio quality on YouTube?

520
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that great.

521
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:39,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that you're not going to be able to tell until you actually have the two side by side in person.

522
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:41,578
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, okay, here's an example.

523
00:37:43,098 --> 00:37:52,540
[SPEAKER_11]: When Symphony of the Night came out on Saturn, Dan and I actually did a side by side comparison because we had seen one done online that we couldn't hear the difference in the music quality.

524
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,620
[SPEAKER_11]: But when we did it on our TV, we could.

525
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:57,021
[SPEAKER_11]: When we had them both running side by side.

526
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:01,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, some people in chat room say, yes, I hear the difference.

527
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very clear.

528
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:02,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

529
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I think people just want to argue.

530
00:38:04,256 --> 00:38:06,097
[SPEAKER_02]: But alright, I'm going to be honest.

531
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:08,519
[SPEAKER_02]: If I closed my eyes, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell you the difference.

532
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,821
[SPEAKER_13]: All I can tell you is the Metallica album.

533
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:11,361
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand.

534
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:12,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see the difference.

535
00:38:12,902 --> 00:38:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the point.

536
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:15,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I get what you guys are saying.

537
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:18,725
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard the new album is mediocre anyway, so what do we even care about it?

538
00:38:18,885 --> 00:38:24,548
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like saying Barney is not in high def quality.

539
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:25,909
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just in normal quality.

540
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:26,950
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fuck?

541
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,750
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't matter.

542
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,350
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Barney.

543
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,211
[SPEAKER_13]: No one gives a shit.

544
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:33,213
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my comparison there.

545
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:34,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The real Tom Sawyer Yes I am

546
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:14,150
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual version of Tom Sawyer kicking off the Moving Pictures album is finally making its way to a rock band this week, they swear.

547
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:19,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, other songs like YYZ, Limelight, you know, those are all from Moving Pictures.

548
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:30,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of songs on that album, but considering it was kind of epic and the albums were only like seven or eight tracks back then and that The Camera Eye is an 11 freaking minute song.

549
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:34,515
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

550
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:01,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely picking it.

551
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:05,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I may not get the whole album, but I do love me some Tom Sawyer.

552
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,333
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of my favorite songs in the first rock band.

553
00:40:07,553 --> 00:40:09,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the real version is much better than the cover version.

554
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:12,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get that at least.

555
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:14,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe YYZ or Limelight.

556
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:15,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know yet.

557
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:20,795
[SPEAKER_02]: 11-minute song, do not want because that will show up in my random playlist, guaranteed.

558
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:23,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get the whole album, sorry.

559
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Tom Sawyer is a really, really freaking good song That's a great album in general It is

560
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:33,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Canada knows how to rock.

561
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:34,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's your proof.

562
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:34,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

563
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:36,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

564
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:49,013
[SPEAKER_13]: So another interesting thing about Guitar Hero, and this has been kind of circling around a little bit, that mystery instrument that G4 hinted to, it's not really an instrument at all, it's a MIDI sequencer.

565
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:50,454
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

566
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:54,775
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to be adding a MIDI sequencer that will allow you to...

567
00:40:56,796 --> 00:41:19,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Import creations like MIDI files from your PC into Guitar Hero World Tour, as well as allowing you to, I guess, at least on the PS3, you'll be able to import different tracks including instruments, rhythm lead, guitar, bass, keyboards, and drum tracks.

568
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,754
[SPEAKER_13]: However, on the 360, you'll only be limited to drums due to hardware issues.

569
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:32,099
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand what hardware issues they could be having that would prevent them from doing this, but whatever.

570
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,281
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I guess it's kind of interesting.

571
00:41:35,401 --> 00:41:40,044
[SPEAKER_13]: No word on price or when it's going to be released, but a MIDI sequencer.

572
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:45,227
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're really hardcore into making, I guess, tracks on there.

573
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:46,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually sounds kind of awesome, though.

574
00:41:47,523 --> 00:41:48,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'd use it.

575
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:04,317
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat says, I think you could also create techno on that.

576
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:04,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you?

577
00:42:05,098 --> 00:42:07,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you make different genres of music and stuff?

578
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:08,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not, right?

579
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:20,649
[SPEAKER_13]: You could make... Well, I was telling them about drum and bass stuff, and they said that, yeah, you can make whatever to your heart's content on there, so you could make a drum and bass track or a techno track if you're that creative.

580
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:22,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

581
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:28,014
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the only thing that kind of makes me want to buy maybe just the game-only version or something, just to check that out.

582
00:42:29,568 --> 00:42:29,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

583
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:30,788
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll wait and see.

584
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:56,527
[SPEAKER_11]: and what was that show, Out of Control?

585
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:58,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of Control, yes.

586
00:42:58,427 --> 00:42:59,607
[SPEAKER_11]: That show was great.

587
00:43:02,628 --> 00:43:03,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Kids in the Hall.

588
00:43:03,268 --> 00:43:04,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Kids in the Hall, like Matt just said.

589
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:08,610
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is that dish with the french fries with gravy, poutain or whatever?

590
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,790
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff is good.

591
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:12,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff is awesome.

592
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:12,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And maple syrup.

593
00:43:14,932 --> 00:43:15,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, maple.

594
00:43:16,232 --> 00:43:16,852

[SPEAKER_02]: And hockey.

597
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:23,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I think Blackwell's just giving us a hard time.

598
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:26,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's really starting to argue with us just for the sake of arguing.

599
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:27,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what's happening.

600
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:29,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, how about some release dates?

601
00:43:30,537 --> 00:43:31,178

[SPEAKER_13]: Forgot that that's actually coming out.

608
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:26,390

614
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:30,333
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, you go to a GameStop and you ask them, Hey, when are the Symbols coming out?

636
00:46:34,036 --> 00:46:36,758

637
00:46:37,499 --> 00:46:41,002

[SPEAKER_02]: No, we can't.

639
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:47,548
[SPEAKER_02]: By cutting out the games that not a single OLR listener cares about.

640
00:46:47,648 --> 00:46:48,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a one.

641
00:46:49,278 --> 00:46:52,060
[SPEAKER_13]: That is being biased right there.

642
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,781

643

646
00:46:57,624 --> 00:46:58,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you're full of poop.

647
00:46:58,644 --> 00:47:01,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Something that says, hey, look, I know you like games, but I hate you.

648
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:02,407
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that kind of thing.

00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:50,820
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

721
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:50,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

722
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I see secret cosplay.

723
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:23,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like a lot of fanboy fantasies might come true with that game, so you might want to check that out.

724
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:25,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a fetish game.

725
00:53:25,632 --> 00:53:26,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice!

726
00:53:26,673 --> 00:53:27,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a fetish game.

727
00:53:28,073 --> 00:53:28,533
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

728
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:29,754
[SPEAKER_11]: It's secret cosplay.

729
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:45,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out in Japan on the Nintendo DS, Gabu Gabu Planet, Knights in the Nightmare, Princess Maker 4 Special Edition, and a game you might know from here in the US, Guitar Hero on Tour makes its way to Japan on the Nintendo DS this week.

730
00:53:47,122 --> 00:54:14,541
[SPEAKER_02]: also lastly on the Sony PSP taking a look to see if anything is coming out next week Patapon gets a price reduction because that game has been very popular Princess Maker 5 Portable it is a Princess Maker week this week you got new ones on the PSP and a price reduction on the DS what a week there you have it your Japanese release dates alright let's get back into some news after the release dates

731
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:19,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, in other news, sorry.

732
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:25,693
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is actually very happy for me because I love freakin' Metal Slug.

733
00:54:26,953 --> 00:54:28,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't we all know this already, right?

734
00:54:29,095 --> 00:54:29,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a rumor.

735
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:44,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it looks like SNK is going to be doing a high def version sort of like how some of the other old school games have gone.

736
00:54:45,092 --> 00:54:46,233
[SPEAKER_11]: So that might be cool.

737
00:54:48,253 --> 00:54:50,734
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want it to still play like Metal Slug.

738
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:53,834
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want it to be 3D.

739
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:58,095
[SPEAKER_11]: I want it to be 2D with very high res pretty pretties.

740
00:54:58,817 --> 00:54:59,177
[SPEAKER_13]: Fogger going 3D

741
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:30,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something was always weird about that.

742
00:55:30,867 --> 00:55:40,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I think that they would be in their best interest to keep the 2D or to go the, you know what I mean by the 2.5D, sort of like how Street Fighter 4 is doing.

743
00:55:40,892 --> 00:55:42,934
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, where it's 3D but plays 2D.

744
00:55:44,114 --> 00:55:45,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for the 2.5D.

745
00:55:45,695 --> 00:55:47,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, what was it?

746
00:55:47,776 --> 00:55:48,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantasy Zone.

747
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:51,597
[SPEAKER_11]: The Sega Ages one that I have.

748
00:55:52,198 --> 00:55:54,859
[SPEAKER_11]: It still played just like the 2D one.

749
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:56,119
[SPEAKER_11]: It was all cel-shaded.

750
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:04,203
[SPEAKER_11]: You couldn't really tell it was 3D, except it would do rotations in some places, and it gave it a little bit more depth to it.

751
00:56:04,743 --> 00:56:08,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that they should do something like that, or if not, just go the high-res route.

752
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:14,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see if we get more information on this soon.

753
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:18,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

754
00:56:19,182 --> 00:56:25,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, in other news, and this is actually pretty cool, Nintendo may actually have a chance to redeem itself.

755
00:56:26,486 --> 00:56:31,349
[SPEAKER_13]: They're actually holding a media summit in early October, supposedly on the 2nd and 3rd.

756
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:33,791
[SPEAKER_13]: This has already been confirmed for Japan.

757
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:37,147
[SPEAKER_13]: What they're going to talk about, who knows?

758
00:56:38,248 --> 00:56:40,670
[SPEAKER_13]: But the event also, there's supposed to be a U.S.

759
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,532
[SPEAKER_13]: event as well taking place in San Francisco around the same time.

760
00:56:45,093 --> 00:57:00,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Guesses, of course, would be the announcement of Disaster Day of Crisis, since it's already been announced for the Japanese market, obviously, since it's coming out next week, and for Europe, because it's coming out in October, but no word on a U.S.

761
00:57:00,805 --> 00:57:01,426
[SPEAKER_13]: release yet.

762
00:57:02,974 --> 00:57:20,693
[SPEAKER_13]: and you know other rumors or thoughts may be that they're going to announce that Conduit's being published by them now maybe some new games or something like that but we'll have to see maybe a storage solution who knows I would like to hear that that would be a wonderful announcement

763
00:57:21,547 --> 00:57:22,748
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

764
00:57:39,696 --> 00:57:42,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft's gonna buy Nintendo and they're gonna conquer the world.

765
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:48,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's kind of interesting, there actually was kind of a little bit of truth to that.

766
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:53,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was explained by Peter Moore, who was talking in an interview this week.

767
00:57:54,018 --> 00:57:55,500
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually mentioned during the interview...

768
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:07,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Balmer wanted to know, and that was an individual that he worked with at Microsoft, Steve Balmer, wanted to know how it was going to win for Microsoft, how we were going to take on Sony, how we would compete with or acquire Nintendo.

769
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:09,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the conversations in those days.

770
00:58:09,392 --> 00:58:11,234
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a classic build-or-buy conversation.

771
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, we were just completely fixated on Sony.

772
00:58:13,996 --> 00:58:15,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo didn't even come into the conversation.

773
00:58:16,198 --> 00:58:17,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice that way he said that, though.

774
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Compete with or acquire Nintendo.

775
00:58:20,602 --> 00:58:21,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

776
00:58:21,443 --> 00:58:23,143
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf chimes in and says Nintendo laughed at Microsoft.

777
00:58:23,163 --> 00:58:24,444
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually did have a meeting.

778
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:55,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when you've got a very, very American company and a very, very Japanese company in that regard, it kind of doesn't surprise me.

779
00:58:56,842 --> 00:58:57,323
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

780
00:58:58,503 --> 00:59:05,867
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think sometimes our perspective might be a little skewed, being over here at what's just a ginormous company and what power Nintendo has.

781
00:59:06,287 --> 00:59:11,230
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting that in some regards, in that way, they've kind of worked together a bit.

782
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:12,050
Hmm.

783
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:16,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, other neat things, Nintendo.

784
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:22,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, they only teased this very briefly during the E3 media event.

785
00:59:23,624 --> 00:59:28,926
[SPEAKER_13]: But Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, now there's a little bit more details coming out from Nintendo Power.

786
00:59:29,906 --> 00:59:34,848
[SPEAKER_13]: And the game itself is actually going to be a cel-shaded isometric game.

787
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:37,128
[SPEAKER_13]: It is still going to be M-rated.

788
00:59:37,188 --> 00:59:38,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, it's still going to be a crime drama.

789
00:59:39,129 --> 00:59:42,650
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually had some screenshots to look... It sort of resembles, I guess...

790
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:50,426
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit like the old Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2, just kind of shot a little different.

791
00:59:51,507 --> 00:59:53,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Almost like the Grand Theft Auto cell phone games that they had.

792
00:59:54,571 --> 00:59:55,993
[SPEAKER_13]: But it looks neat.

793
00:59:56,213 --> 00:59:57,495
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be interesting to check out.

794
00:59:59,377 --> 01:00:02,781
[SPEAKER_13]: So as a Grand Theft Auto fan, you're interested?

795
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:04,927
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm interested to check it out.

796
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:09,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the artwork looks kind of weird, but it'll be interesting to see how the game plays.

797
01:00:09,892 --> 01:00:14,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be definitely willing to check it out because it's Grand Theft Auto and I love Grand Theft Auto.

798
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:20,682
[SPEAKER_13]: They're saying, though, that the game is going to take place in a sizable portion of Liberty City.

799
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:20,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

800
01:00:25,086 --> 01:00:28,890
[SPEAKER_13]: The map has been altered from, of course, the console version, which only makes sense.

801
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:33,654
[SPEAKER_13]: And the missions will also be shorter and can easily be restarted upon failure.

802
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:38,779
[SPEAKER_13]: The D-pad is going to be used for aiming while the R button activates an auto-targeting.

803
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:47,427
[SPEAKER_13]: And there is going to be a subtle auto-steering built into the driving controls as well, so you can shoot out the window and stuff like that.

804
01:00:48,047 --> 01:00:48,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

805
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:05,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

806
01:01:06,048 --> 01:01:12,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to backtrack just a little bit, go into the last story, because sometimes our chat room is a little behind because of the delay from when we say something to when it goes out over the radio.

807
01:01:12,654 --> 01:01:17,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But kind of a comment on the whole Microsoft Nintendo thing and how I mentioned that Microsoft kind of plays nicely with the DS.

808
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,523
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClock gives an interesting comment in our chat room, chat.orange.radio.com.

809
01:01:21,823 --> 01:01:22,504
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

810
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:53,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a feeling that if they were to get into the handheld market, it wouldn't be with the Zune.

811
01:01:54,371 --> 01:01:58,014
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they did, I don't think they'd have trouble passing up the PSP.

812
01:01:58,575 --> 01:02:03,299
[SPEAKER_13]: The DS, on the other hand, though, I don't think they'd be able to beat.

813
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:05,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 3 is coming soon!

814
01:02:22,468 --> 01:02:26,671
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have to kind of clear out the cache first, though, before the download will actually happen there.

815
01:02:27,051 --> 01:02:40,040
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you get the new updates, there's going to be a brand new ranking system, some changes to the playlist, some brand new achievements, which will be cool, a complete overhaul to Bungie.net, which is pretty cool, and the Bungie.net website is slowly changing throughout the next week.

816
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:48,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So, pretty cool there, and I know some of you achievement whores are very excited about new achievements, so you'll be able to check that out this Tuesday with the free update to Halo 3.

817
01:02:50,226 --> 01:02:50,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

818
01:02:54,093 --> 01:02:59,115
[SPEAKER_11]: And other MMO news, there actually have been some more details put out about Star Trek Online.

819
01:03:00,135 --> 01:03:02,196
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that a few of us have been looking forward to this.

820
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:17,283
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually said on the website that there are going to be more details coming out soon, but for right now, the ships are going to be something like naval combat using traditional MMO gameplay.

821
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:42,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Klingon ships are going to be different a bit more reflecting of their culture everything will be very customizable you can modify and customize the uniforms of the characters but they still have to look like a uniform so the options are going to take things from the show and bring in some new things so it's supposed to be cool and is it supposed to be out in the next three years?

822
01:03:43,789 --> 01:03:44,849
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a long wait

823
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:46,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's worth it.

824
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:07,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, other fun PC games, of course, Spore, and one of the biggest complaints about Spore, of course, is some of the DRM restrictions.

825
01:04:08,393 --> 01:04:12,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, EA has heard your pleas, and they have decided to loosen them up a bit.

826
01:04:12,976 --> 01:04:17,519
[SPEAKER_13]: So now, some of the changes that they've had, and of course, without...

827
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Deauthorize machines and move authorizations to new machines.

828
01:04:44,779 --> 01:04:52,585
[SPEAKER_13]: On top of that, they're going to allow you to log in multiple characters into each account.

829
01:04:52,605 --> 01:05:01,132
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to be able to have up to five different players on each of your activations.

830
01:05:02,012 --> 01:05:02,573
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of cool.

831
01:05:03,186 --> 01:05:03,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Dream on!

832
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just the way it's going to be.

833
01:05:21,932 --> 01:05:23,073
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the day and age we live in.

834
01:05:23,113 --> 01:05:24,874
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what they're going to try to do to protect their games.

835
01:05:25,194 --> 01:05:30,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it still does kind of suck that people crack it days before the release and the legitimate users have to suffer.

836
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:33,982
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like having a car alarm in your car.

837
01:05:34,002 --> 01:05:37,585
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's not going to prevent people from stealing stuff out of your car.

838
01:05:37,985 --> 01:05:39,246
[SPEAKER_13]: It just makes it more difficult.

839
01:05:39,847 --> 01:05:42,569
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just like the Securarm stuff and DRM stuff.

840
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:43,530
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just going to make people...

841
01:05:44,488 --> 01:05:45,149
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

842
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:07,012
[SPEAKER_02]: R.A.T.H.

843
01:06:07,032 --> 01:06:07,893
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Lich King

844
01:06:29,703 --> 01:06:30,984
[SPEAKER_02]: November 13th, 2008.

845
01:06:32,165 --> 01:06:36,109
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have some Warcrack addicted friends, expect them to call in sick on this day.

846
01:06:36,569 --> 01:06:43,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they probably will be working on heading up to Northrend and some of the new areas up there like the Howling Fjord and trying to level the characters to 80.

847
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:51,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe playing some Lake Wintergrasp, running some of the new instances, leveling Inscription or their new Death Knight.

848
01:06:52,082 --> 01:06:54,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Millions of different things to do in the new Warcraft expansion.

849
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to the dance studio myself.

850
01:06:58,077 --> 01:07:01,183
[SPEAKER_02]: You can teach characters new dances now, apparently, which is badly needed.

851
01:07:01,805 --> 01:07:03,368
[SPEAKER_02]: And also you can get your characters some haircuts.

852
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,996
[SPEAKER_02]: So, very interesting how you can almost...

853
01:07:09,676 --> 01:07:11,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Micromanage even more.

854
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:14,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the last thing our MMO needed, more micromanaging.

855
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:15,823
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

856
01:07:16,304 --> 01:07:21,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's a new add-on coming to World of Warcraft, and it's Bejeweled.

857
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:27,497
[SPEAKER_13]: And oddly enough, this game started off as a kind of a third-party knockoff Bejeweled.

858
01:07:28,058 --> 01:07:29,640
[SPEAKER_13]: It was called Besharded.

859
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:39,504
[SPEAKER_13]: and the developer Frumwiller actually kind of made it as a method of killing time during long raids and farming sessions.

860
01:07:40,485 --> 01:07:57,833
[SPEAKER_13]: But apparently PopCap caught wind of it and instead of having them stop making it, they actually hired him on to create a more polished version of the application that will be released for the game.

861
01:07:59,016 --> 01:08:00,857
[SPEAKER_13]: So you'll be able to play Bejeweled.

862
01:08:01,718 --> 01:08:03,279
[SPEAKER_13]: And my wife was excited to hear this.

863
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:11,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So now if your wife gets sucked into getting World of Warcraft... Yeah, she's just going to be playing Bejeweled in there.

864
01:08:11,363 --> 01:08:12,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Just sitting there playing Bejeweled.

865
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:15,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

866
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:17,787
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll go, Warcraft's the best game ever.

867
01:08:19,248 --> 01:08:20,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it has Bejeweled in it.

868
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:23,866
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no, you were telling this on Bobby's show.

869
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:25,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you told it on our show, though.

870
01:08:25,628 --> 01:08:28,710
[SPEAKER_02]: The wife is actually signing up for a Warcraft account thanks to Extifer.

871
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:31,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, she's trying the 14-day trial.

872
01:08:32,213 --> 01:08:39,399
[SPEAKER_13]: She may actually do a month and 14 days because Extifer wants to get... I guess you get some recruitment bonuses or something like that.

873
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:46,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of like the military or something where you get special mounts or triple experience or some shit.

874
01:08:46,224 --> 01:08:46,625
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

875
01:08:46,685 --> 01:08:47,465
[SPEAKER_13]: It's retarded, but...

876
01:08:48,426 --> 01:09:11,523
[SPEAKER_13]: um so she may indulge him in that but um yeah she's gonna try it i have to install it on this laptop that i'm using right now because you're that i buy her a new laptop she wants me to buy her a mac and i'm like fuck that shit oh my god i think now the wife is purposely trying to get into things that you don't like just to piss you off i don't know

877
01:09:12,642 --> 01:09:15,263
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think she... The thing is, you have to know her.

878
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:16,624
[SPEAKER_13]: She doesn't have the patience for it.

879
01:09:17,105 --> 01:09:19,126
[SPEAKER_13]: And she's going to quit very fast.

880
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:27,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be very surprised if she actually... We should take bets on what level Nelly will quit at.

881
01:09:28,211 --> 01:09:30,252
[SPEAKER_02]: How far she gets her character up before she quits.

882
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:31,693
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm down with that.

883
01:09:33,214 --> 01:09:34,074
[SPEAKER_02]: What would the bet be?

884
01:09:34,895 --> 01:09:36,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

885
01:09:36,796 --> 01:09:38,457
[SPEAKER_02]: What does the loser have to do?

886
01:09:38,657 --> 01:09:40,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what does the loser get?

887
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:40,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Or winner get...

888
01:09:42,316 --> 01:09:44,397
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

889
01:10:11,752 --> 01:10:13,674
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

890
01:10:39,349 --> 01:10:47,738
[SPEAKER_11]: For lack of a better game, I picked Snake Rattle and Roll because I know it's a game that somebody I think is great really likes.

891
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:49,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, me?

892
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:50,742
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

893
01:10:51,963 --> 01:10:52,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like it.

894
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:58,325
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I put it on there for Sauce, although I think it's been a while since she's played it.

895
01:10:58,906 --> 01:11:04,654
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was a game that was made by Rare, and it came out on the NES in 1990.

896
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:10,822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the earliest platform games, but it's a 3D isometric playing field, sort of like how Marble Madness was.

897
01:11:11,783 --> 01:11:18,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, they, uh, actually, it didn't really sell all that great, but it was actually kind of a fun little game.

898
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:19,168
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really difficult, too.

899
01:11:19,628 --> 01:11:26,272
[SPEAKER_11]: But the whole point is that you are two snakes called Battle and Roll, and you have to eat these little things called Nibbly Pibblies and race to the moon.

900
01:11:27,773 --> 01:11:29,093
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's what you play.

901
01:11:29,193 --> 01:11:32,735
[SPEAKER_11]: There was supposed to be a sequel called Snakes and Things, but it was never made.

902
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:41,240
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was Sneaky Snakes for Game Boy in 1991, and it had a version come out on the Mega Drive in 1993.

903
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:43,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's pretty cool.

904
01:11:44,202 --> 01:11:45,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I never knew there was a Mega Drive version of this.

905
01:11:45,903 --> 01:11:46,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat.

906
01:11:46,624 --> 01:11:46,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

907
01:11:48,955 --> 01:11:50,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like this game quite a bit.

908
01:11:50,095 --> 01:11:50,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a lot of fun.

909
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:52,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of sad we never got that sequel.

910
01:11:52,597 --> 01:11:53,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a Rare game.

911
01:11:54,299 --> 01:12:00,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yet again, here's another great franchise that Rare could go back and revisit someday on, I don't know, Xbox Live Arcade.

912
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But I somehow think they never will.

913
01:12:03,246 --> 01:12:03,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is sad.

914
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:04,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me cry.

915
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:06,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

916
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:08,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it looks like that's it.

917
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your Classic Game of the Week, folks!

918
01:12:10,271 --> 01:12:11,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Snake, Rattle, and Roll.

919
01:12:12,993 --> 01:12:14,474
[SPEAKER_02]: For the Nintendo Entertainment System.

920
01:12:15,475 --> 01:12:16,896
[SPEAKER_02]: But also on the Mega Drive, apparently.

921
01:12:17,076 --> 01:12:17,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I just learned tonight.

922
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:23,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, on that note, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

923
01:12:24,268 --> 01:12:26,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we're going to talk about Mega Man 9.

924
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,872
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also talk about a new Suikoden game.

925
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:30,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk about Project Gotham Racing 5.

926
01:12:30,956 --> 01:12:33,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all coming up in Part B. So hey, don't go anywhere.

927
01:12:33,619 --> 01:12:34,220
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.

928
01:12:42,148 --> 01:12:43,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a bad day?

929
01:12:44,069 --> 01:12:45,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Job getting you down?

930
01:12:46,349 --> 01:12:48,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking for something to pick you up?

931
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:50,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you a laugh all at the same time?

932
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:53,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Then oh brother do I have the show for you.

933
01:12:55,912 --> 01:13:03,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Brad Boyer and join me each week on The Geek Spin as I scour the net to bring you the best in comedy music.

934
01:13:04,354 --> 01:13:07,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Check us out www.TheGeekSpin.com

935
01:13:12,107 --> 01:13:14,729
[SPEAKER_02]: How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?

936
01:13:14,749 --> 01:13:18,311
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have a rape carnival.

937
01:13:20,713 --> 01:13:22,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them to rape things because rape is funny.

938
01:13:25,816 --> 01:13:28,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk around the neighborhood and rape cats in your neighborhood.

939
01:13:28,338 --> 01:13:29,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold a plastic knife.

940
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:30,079
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to have a plastic knife.

941
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:31,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And take pictures.

942
01:13:33,982 --> 01:13:36,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, rape isn't funny.

943
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:38,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless if it's clown rape.

944
01:14:01,357 --> 01:14:01,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Brad.

945
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:02,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Glenn.

946
01:14:02,778 --> 01:14:03,499
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm Christina.

947
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:07,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're from the PodCulture Podcast and PodCulture.net.

948
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:13,847
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're done here and you find yourself hungry for some more geeky goodness, head on over and check us out at PodCulture.net.

949
01:14:14,127 --> 01:14:19,451
[SPEAKER_03]: From A-plus shows to grade Z movies and everything else in between like comics and video games.

950
01:14:19,731 --> 01:14:23,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Along with the occasional special musical guest, there's something for the geek in us all.

951
01:14:23,574 --> 01:14:27,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So let your geek flag fly and head on out to our little corner of the burst.

952
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:29,979
[SPEAKER_05]: www.podculture.net.

953
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:30,980
[SPEAKER_00]: PodCulture.

954
01:14:31,571 --> 01:14:32,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Equal Opportunity GeekNet.

955
01:14:33,353 --> 01:14:33,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Be seeing ya.

956
01:14:43,376 --> 01:14:47,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.

957
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:53,162
[SPEAKER_09]: To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.

958
01:14:53,462 --> 01:14:55,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, except that asshole.

959
01:14:55,864 --> 01:14:58,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.

960
01:14:58,826 --> 01:15:07,791
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.

961
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:12,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back kids to Orange Lounge Radio.

962
01:15:13,157 --> 01:15:15,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 21st, 2008.

963
01:15:17,278 --> 01:15:20,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Five weeks to go until episode 300, if you can believe it.

964
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:25,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we've been on the air that long to have done 300 weekly episodes.

965
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we've missed a week here and there, so it's taken us a little over six years to get here.

966
01:15:30,741 --> 01:15:33,082
[SPEAKER_02]: But quite an accomplishment.

967
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:36,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know many other shows, if any, that have gotten to the 300 weekly show mark.

968
01:15:37,463 --> 01:15:40,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, now we're trying to decide what exactly we're going to do to celebrate.

969
01:15:41,005 --> 01:15:42,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try to get some big guests on the show that week.

970
01:15:42,786 --> 01:15:48,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I'm going to try to start sending some emails this week and just have a potpourri of big names on the show that week.

971
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:51,791
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, I'm not sure what other surprises we have in store.

972
01:15:51,831 --> 01:15:55,713
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have suggestions, please email us or email me directly.

973
01:15:55,753 --> 01:15:57,854
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get all our contact information on the website.

974
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:02,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, we've got lots more gaming news to discuss and only a little bit of time to do it, so let's get back to it.

975
01:16:02,979 --> 01:16:05,222
[SPEAKER_02]: During the break, we heard some music from the new Mega Man 9.

976
01:16:06,343 --> 01:16:10,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, folks on the podcast don't get to hear that because of the whole copyright and all that stuff.

977
01:16:10,647 --> 01:16:16,694
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't offer it up for download, but live listeners did hear it, and I believe Loki's going to start us off with some Mega Man 9 news tonight.

978
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:29,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, in fact, if you liked Mega Man 9's music, you're going to like it even more when you can actually buy the game, which comes out on the 22nd or tomorrow if you're listening to us live on the WiiWare download service.

979
01:16:29,977 --> 01:16:35,818
[SPEAKER_13]: If you do not own a Wii and you own a PS3, you will be able to purchase it on the PlayStation Network on the 25th.

980
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:40,179
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you want it on the 360, well, you're going to have to wait until October 1st.

981
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:44,561
[SPEAKER_13]: It will be available soon, and that's awesome.

982
01:16:45,341 --> 01:16:50,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Another thing that will be available shortly after all that comes out is some download content for Mega Man 9.

983
01:16:51,705 --> 01:16:55,568
[SPEAKER_13]: The first new playable character they're going to include is Proto Man.

984
01:16:56,888 --> 01:16:58,930
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to actually be able to use him.

985
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:08,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the stuff that you get, like the Rush Adapters, actually change to Proto Adapters in the game, including the Proto Sled, Proto Coil, etc.

986
01:17:09,076 --> 01:17:10,256
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it's all just kind of...

987
01:17:11,477 --> 01:17:15,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, it's just crazy that there's download content for like an old school Nintendo game in a way.

988
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,581
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of cool.

989
01:17:16,781 --> 01:17:17,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

990
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:18,182
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really, really cool.

991
01:17:19,043 --> 01:17:19,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

992
01:17:19,703 --> 01:17:26,048
[SPEAKER_13]: So that'll be available on October 6th for two bucks or the equivalent thereof.

993
01:17:26,288 --> 01:17:33,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, even though we can't play the entire Mega Man 9 soundtrack or so on the live show, we can play a little clip.

994
01:17:33,353 --> 01:17:34,854
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's what some of the music sounds like.

995
01:17:34,914 --> 01:17:37,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a clip from Tornado Man's stage.

996
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:51,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see it has all that same retro goodness of the old school of Mega Man games, like you knew it was going to have.

997
01:17:51,351 --> 01:17:51,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

998
01:17:51,811 --> 01:17:52,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

999
01:17:52,371 --> 01:18:05,874
[SPEAKER_13]: And some other cool stuff, if you happen to be all nostalgic and love playing Mega Man 9, well, I don't know if you remember that fake, well, I guess old school box art they had going out for Mega Man 9.

1000
01:18:06,634 --> 01:18:08,815
[SPEAKER_02]: The really human face for Mega Man.

1001
01:18:08,835 --> 01:18:09,975
[SPEAKER_02]: That was scary.

1002
01:18:10,676 --> 01:18:24,341
[SPEAKER_13]: You now can actually purchase the fake box, a fake NES cart, and I guess it may come with the Asset CD that they were handing out before because these were for press release stuff.

1003
01:18:24,641 --> 01:18:26,722
[SPEAKER_13]: They had screenshots and all sorts of stuff.

1004
01:18:27,142 --> 01:18:34,885
[SPEAKER_13]: But they are available on the Capcom store, so you can find those at capcom-unity.com and

1005
01:18:35,965 --> 01:18:37,687
[SPEAKER_13]: They will be exceedingly rare.

1006
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:44,473
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're interested in getting it, you might want to put an order in as soon as possible.

1007
01:18:45,214 --> 01:18:45,714
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of neat.

1008
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:48,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, how much do you think those things will start going for on eBay?

1009
01:18:48,897 --> 01:18:49,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1010
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:51,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Quite a bit, I'd imagine.

1011
01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:55,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone in here planning to get that game this week?

1012
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:56,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1013
01:18:57,085 --> 01:18:57,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to.

1014
01:18:59,338 --> 01:19:05,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, of course, having a little trouble with her voice tonight because of the allergies, but I think she just said they think they're going to get it this week.

1015
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:13,903
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to because I think the D-pad on the Wii is pretty awesome, whereas the D-pad on the 360, not so awesome.

1016
01:19:14,023 --> 01:19:17,744
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I love achievement points, so therefore I will be getting none of that, too.

1017
01:19:18,089 --> 01:19:21,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I'm going to be holding off on the 360 version, even though the controller bugs the crap out of me.

1018
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:28,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of hoping that's one of the things Microsoft's going to fix in 09, based on what we saw at the Leipzig show.

1019
01:19:29,075 --> 01:19:29,695
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I'm hoping.

1020
01:19:30,316 --> 01:19:30,636
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1021
01:19:31,757 --> 01:19:36,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, other games and other big franchises that people are really excited about.

1022
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:36,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Suikoden!

1023
01:19:36,879 --> 01:19:38,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've got a few Suikoden fans in the house.

1024
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,902
[SPEAKER_02]: A brand new Suikoden game was announced for DS.

1025
01:19:40,962 --> 01:19:46,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a numbered Suikoden game, but a new game called Suikoden Tyrkriz is the new game that's coming out.

1026
01:19:47,185 --> 01:19:48,706
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is kind of neat.

1027
01:19:48,746 --> 01:19:58,114
[SPEAKER_02]: What's kind of cool about this game, again, the big niche of the Suikoden series, you could say, is that it's a classic JRPG, but you have 108 characters in it.

1028
01:19:58,134 --> 01:20:00,516
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just tons and tons and tons of characters.

1029
01:20:00,576 --> 01:20:06,842
[SPEAKER_02]: What's kind of cool about this one is that with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection now, you can actually play...

1030
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:33,677
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're leveling one of the 108 people but somebody else can level the other characters so you can kind of like all kind of participate in leveling up the different characters so it provides a new way to level up characters and creates a little bit of a community and apparently when they say Nintendo Wi-Fi connection they are talking the internet not just a local Wi-Fi connection so that could be very interesting I'm kind of curious to see how this plays out so more information to come on that

1031
01:20:34,217 --> 01:20:38,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, this was shown at a Konami event that we weren't invited to this year.

1032
01:20:39,259 --> 01:20:39,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

1033
01:20:39,659 --> 01:20:40,580
[SPEAKER_02]: But I heard it was in New York.

1034
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,260
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably why.

1035
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:42,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1036
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:43,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably wasn't on our coast.

1037
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:44,201
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure it was.

1038
01:20:44,741 --> 01:20:45,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well.

1039
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:48,823
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they couldn't fly us out there, even though they flew everybody else out there.

1040
01:20:48,883 --> 01:20:49,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

1041
01:20:49,263 --> 01:20:50,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we're going to be bitter much.

1042
01:20:50,884 --> 01:20:52,305
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can't really tell you much more about the game.

1043
01:20:52,385 --> 01:20:53,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, darn.

1044
01:20:53,425 --> 01:20:56,826
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't play Rock Revolution, maybe have a positive impression of it.

1045
01:20:56,866 --> 01:20:59,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think maybe that's why you didn't get an invite?

1046
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:00,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no, I don't think so.

1047
01:21:01,348 --> 01:21:01,989
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, you know what?

1048
01:21:02,049 --> 01:21:03,831
[SPEAKER_02]: If a game stinks, we're not going to hold back at the same time.

1049
01:21:03,871 --> 01:21:08,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more important we have integrity than, you know... I could have... But see, that's the thing.

1050
01:21:08,317 --> 01:21:12,363
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm only taking it based off of, you know, screenshots and stuff.

1051
01:21:12,383 --> 01:21:13,404
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not very accurate.

1052
01:21:13,484 --> 01:21:17,670
[SPEAKER_13]: And with, you know, outplaying it, I can't really give you my true impression, but...

1053
01:21:18,902 --> 01:21:31,517
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, who cares, it's not important so anyway, Suikoden looks interesting though I've missed out on some of the more recent Suikoden games, but I did enjoy the ones on Playstation 1, so I might have a reason to check it out, I think the online component sounds neat

1054
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:38,778
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Peter Molyneux, he actually, of course, has this little game coming out called Fable 2.

1055
01:21:39,879 --> 01:21:49,705
[SPEAKER_13]: And you may remember there were some games released on Xbox Live Arcade called the Fable 2 Pub Games, where you can earn gold to use in the actual game.

1056
01:21:50,346 --> 01:21:56,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, of course, people found exploits and glitches to be able to make a lot of money really quick.

1057
01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:06,798
[SPEAKER_13]: and according to Peter Molyneux, that was intentional in that they're going to be in for a surprise when they actually start the game.

1058
01:22:07,258 --> 01:22:12,282
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course now there's a patch being put out that fixes that and all that stuff.

1059
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:16,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Somehow I think he's full of shit, to be honest, and I don't think it was intentional.

1060
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:22,531
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think maybe if you try it with this new patch, it will do trigger something, but I think...

1061
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:32,580
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're doing it, and besides, you can also clear out your hard drive cache or whatever and erase these updates and cheat anyways, I don't think it's going to matter.

1062
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:34,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of curious to see what happens.

1063
01:22:35,182 --> 01:22:43,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I do claim bullshit on the fact that it was premeditated, but I think there is some legitimacy to the fact that something will happen in the game if you cheat it.

1064
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they will be able to

1065
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:45,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1066
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:01,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not saying something about the game.

1067
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:07,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm saying that the Xbox Live Arcade game is going to have to be patched in order for it to be able to detect the cheating.

1068
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:18,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think that you're going to try it, and if you try the same technique to cheat now, now that they have it patched in, that it's going to raise a flag or something that's going to cause it to trigger in the game.

1069
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,402
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're that worried about it, just flush your...

1070
01:23:21,483 --> 01:23:24,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Fable 2 pub games file and flush your hard drive.

1071
01:23:24,924 --> 01:23:27,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly, just do it offline.

1072
01:23:27,165 --> 01:23:29,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And the patch is actually already live, according to Zushi.

1073
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:30,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is already live.

1074
01:23:30,847 --> 01:23:34,408
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't actually played the pub games yet, even though I got them.

1075
01:23:34,428 --> 01:23:37,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I played them for like five minutes.

1076
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:41,611
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is just basically a fancy slot machine, which brings nothing new to the table.

1077
01:23:42,091 --> 01:23:44,512
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one is kind of like a weird version of roulette.

1078
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:48,674
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pyramid game was interesting, but it didn't hold my attention for long enough.

1079
01:23:49,594 --> 01:23:49,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly.

1080
01:23:51,275 --> 01:23:56,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people were just getting it to exploit the hell out of it for when the game actually comes out, but I don't know.

1081
01:23:56,677 --> 01:23:57,738
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think in chat?

1082
01:23:57,758 --> 01:24:01,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it was intentional the whole time that they intended to have an exploit in there?

1083
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:06,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does definitely kind of tie into the whole good versus evil thing that Fable has, but I think it's crap.

1084
01:24:07,162 --> 01:24:15,646
[SPEAKER_13]: He likes to sound like a smarty pants and just, you know, trying to, oh, I did all this stuff because I think outside the box, I think greater than loss.

1085
01:24:15,766 --> 01:24:17,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think he thought anything.

1086
01:24:17,206 --> 01:24:18,047
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just a glitch.

1087
01:24:18,608 --> 01:24:22,658
[SPEAKER_13]: That now they're patching in some sort of repercussion if you try it.

1088
01:24:23,661 --> 01:24:24,723
[SPEAKER_13]: So, whatever.

1089
01:24:25,646 --> 01:24:26,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Big freaking whoop.

1090
01:24:27,788 --> 01:24:33,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows if we'll get a new Fable game next year, but one game we'll probably get next year is a brand new James Bond game.

1091
01:24:33,692 --> 01:24:37,794
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, Activision has said that they are planning to put out yearly Bond games.

1092
01:24:37,854 --> 01:24:43,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the movies only seem to come out every other year, they're going to actually be trying to crank out yearly Bond titles.

1093
01:24:43,338 --> 01:24:45,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, right now the game they're trying to put out is Quantum of Solace.

1094
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:51,203
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually based on the Call of Duty 4 engine, and obviously the movie tie-in they've got this year.

1095
01:24:51,363 --> 01:24:51,904
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1096
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,702
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1097
01:25:31,344 --> 01:25:33,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that they've been wonderful, but who knows?

1098
01:25:34,425 --> 01:25:35,045
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

1099
01:25:35,426 --> 01:25:38,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, just really quickly, I wanted to go over some of the responses.

1100
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:40,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Was the pub games intentional or not?

1101
01:25:42,088 --> 01:25:44,349
[SPEAKER_02]: James Patrick says, Peter M isn't a typical guy.

1102
01:25:44,469 --> 01:25:47,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could very well be intentional.

1103
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:51,151
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru says, they should keep the cheat in, but have it make you more evil.

1104
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:53,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, yeah, you can cheat, but it's an evil act.

1105
01:25:54,032 --> 01:25:54,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.

1106
01:25:55,253 --> 01:25:56,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see what happens.

1107
01:25:58,494 --> 01:25:58,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1108
01:26:00,179 --> 01:26:03,080
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want to comment on our stories chat.orangeloungeradio.com

1109
01:26:04,249 --> 01:26:05,029
[SPEAKER_11]: We want comments.

1110
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:11,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this actually is good news for our European listeners, or anybody listening or not, but we hope you're listening.

1111
01:26:12,551 --> 01:26:16,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut on the 19th of September.

1112
01:26:17,132 --> 01:26:18,052
[SPEAKER_11]: The 360 Arcade is going to £129.

1113
01:26:18,092 --> 01:26:21,513
[SPEAKER_11]: The 60GB Pro is going to £169, and the 120GB Elite is to £29.

1114
01:26:21,553 --> 01:26:21,833
[SPEAKER_11]: So, good news.

1115
01:26:34,256 --> 01:26:35,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, cheaper things!

1116
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:41,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad, you know, because Europe sometimes gets the shaft in a lot of our news stories, so it's nice to hear them getting a break once in a while.

1117
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:46,457
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too bad they didn't get it the same time we did, but hey, better late than never, right?

1118
01:26:47,058 --> 01:26:47,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1119
01:26:48,258 --> 01:26:58,584
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a big old rumor coming out about Project Gotham 5, saying now that it's being developed by the Forza development team, and that there could be an announcement for it next week.

1120
01:26:59,224 --> 01:27:06,548
[SPEAKER_13]: According to a website called Addict Gaming, they have a reliable source saying,

1121
01:27:07,569 --> 01:27:08,230
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1122
01:27:24,702 --> 01:27:25,583
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.

1123
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:48,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Heaven forbid, Microsoft and G4 could have been lying to us and it's actually going to happen.

1124
01:27:49,321 --> 01:27:51,261
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, once again, we'll see you next week.

1125
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:52,202
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1126
01:27:52,482 --> 01:28:02,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think, I don't know, if I were G4 Television and I had a big exclusive thing that I was going to be dedicating, you know, five hours of programming to, don't you think I would have started advertising it like six weeks ago?

1127
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:09,845
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because if they want to be a surprise, and this was the agreement with Microsoft to keep it hush-hush super secret until the very end, you know.

1128
01:28:09,925 --> 01:28:11,085
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the point of a surprise?

1129
01:28:11,205 --> 01:28:12,005
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1130
01:28:12,265 --> 01:28:12,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

1131
01:28:13,045 --> 01:28:14,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying it's bullshit, that's all.

1132
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:37,311
[SPEAKER_13]: and that there's an announcement coming soon.

1133
01:28:37,391 --> 01:28:39,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe this announcement could come at the same time.

1134
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:44,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Just saying there's kind of smoke here that they're maybe going to announce something soon about something.

1135
01:28:44,554 --> 01:28:49,917
[SPEAKER_13]: So I still don't believe they're going to do a five-hour long thing on G4, but who knows?

1136
01:28:50,037 --> 01:28:52,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe there's something somewhere in the middle ground that's coming.

1137
01:28:53,178 --> 01:28:57,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Just saying because, you know, all those Microsoft rumors, you know, they always seem to come true somehow.

1138
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:58,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

1139
01:28:59,827 --> 01:29:01,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some people are very excited about this rumor.

1140
01:29:01,993 --> 01:29:06,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft in chat says, Project Gotham Racing 5, developed by the Forza team, do want...

1141
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:10,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not as into the Project Gotham and Forza games as much as I am the more simple ones.

1142
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Racing games, so to speak.

1143
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:42,302
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not, like, super into cars, but I like the more Need for Speed, Burnout-type games, but I love dumb, simple, like, dumb, dumb, dumb, simple racing games like F-Zero and Mario Kart.

1144
01:29:42,662 --> 01:29:48,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love it if they would make a next-gen, like, dumb racing game that's like F-Zero.

1145
01:29:48,103 --> 01:29:49,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want, like, a next-gen F-Zero game.

1146
01:29:49,683 --> 01:29:50,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't you tell?

1147
01:29:50,444 --> 01:29:51,804
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times have I said it on the show?

1148
01:29:53,244 --> 01:29:56,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish that would be what they'd announce at Nintendo's press events coming up.

1149
01:29:56,925 --> 01:29:57,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be nice?

1150
01:29:58,803 --> 01:29:59,344
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1151
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:16,120
[SPEAKER_02]: and some new download content that's coming out.

1152
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:17,481
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the 8-Ball Pack.

1153
01:30:17,521 --> 01:30:18,681
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be coming out this fall.

1154
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:23,562
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be two brand new multiplayer things and eight new cars, hence the name of the 8-Ball Pack.

1155
01:30:24,022 --> 01:30:30,843
[SPEAKER_02]: A McLaren F1 GTR, a Honda S2000, a 1971 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am are some of the new things you can look for.

1156
01:30:31,523 --> 01:30:34,504
[SPEAKER_02]: The expansion will be released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1157
01:30:35,144 --> 01:30:42,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to also bring some new achievements thanks to four new achievements, 100 gamers score, of course on the PlayStation 3, that would be trophies.

1158
01:30:43,265 --> 01:30:58,171
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's also going to be some new multiplayer events as well it's pretty cool not quite specific on what the price is going to be for this or what the exact release date is but just plan on it soon as in this fall if you're a grid player

1159
01:30:58,971 --> 01:31:04,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, something else that's coming soon is the PlayStation firmware 2.5.

1160
01:31:05,716 --> 01:31:09,019
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to be likely later October.

1161
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:14,203
[SPEAKER_13]: And supposedly, simultaneously with that, it will be the release of Home 1.0.

1162
01:31:16,064 --> 01:31:45,554
[SPEAKER_13]: so finally the beta will be over and you'll actually well the beta won't necessarily be over but you'll actually be able to participate in it and it says they're waiting for a system software update to the PS3 to deal with this I guess some sporadic network issues that they have with home right now and then they're going to reopen it sometime I guess this week for thousands of new testers but in October is when they're supposed to bite the bullet and actually

1163
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,903
[SPEAKER_13]: launch this thing they've been teasing for a long time now.

1164
01:31:53,667 --> 01:31:58,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Wouldn't it be funny if they just came out in October and go, uh, yeah, it's coming out spring of 2009.

1165
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:00,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd laugh.

1166
01:32:00,453 --> 01:32:03,456
[SPEAKER_02]: No, haven't they, like, guaranteed that it's coming out this year?

1167
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:04,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

1168
01:32:04,317 --> 01:32:10,663
[SPEAKER_13]: They guaranteed that the PlayStation 3 was coming out in the spring and ended up getting delayed to the fall, so nothing's guaranteed.

1169
01:32:11,143 --> 01:32:11,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

1170
01:32:12,867 --> 01:32:15,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I... Are you looking forward to trying out Home?

1171
01:32:15,650 --> 01:32:16,450
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't really care.

1172
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:17,211
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really care?

1173
01:32:17,591 --> 01:32:18,292
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll test it out.

1174
01:32:18,312 --> 01:32:20,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about Home.

1175
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:22,356
[SPEAKER_13]: I honestly don't think it's going to be that great.

1176
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:23,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just going to be kind of eh.

1177
01:32:24,478 --> 01:32:25,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at what we can do.

1178
01:32:25,499 --> 01:32:26,079
[SPEAKER_13]: We're different.

1179
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:26,780
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, great.

1180
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:31,064
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a way to differentiate themselves, but we'll see how they actually use it.

1181
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:32,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1182
01:32:32,405 --> 01:32:32,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1183
01:32:33,379 --> 01:32:35,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, you know what's kind of funny we're talking about?

1184
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:42,261
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just joking around in chat right now, and people were talking about racing games, and Alpha Cananogram said there is a next-gen racing game.

1185
01:32:42,301 --> 01:32:45,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Crazy Woman Driver, also known as Excite Truck.

1186
01:32:45,682 --> 01:32:48,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like, they should make a game called Crazy Woman Driver.

1187
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:50,263
[SPEAKER_02]: But it should be like, not really.

1188
01:32:50,303 --> 01:32:51,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to say that with malice.

1189
01:32:51,903 --> 01:32:58,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I don't think all women are crazy drivers, but I think there should be a game based around crazy women driving.

1190
01:32:59,165 --> 01:33:01,288
[SPEAKER_11]: So then we get the sequel, Small Penis Trucking?

1191
01:33:02,249 --> 01:33:02,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure!

1192
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:04,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, fine by me.

1193
01:33:04,072 --> 01:33:05,413
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have Small Penis Trucking.

1194
01:33:05,493 --> 01:33:05,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

1195
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:06,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair is fair.

1196
01:33:06,975 --> 01:33:07,676
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have both.

1197
01:33:08,177 --> 01:33:10,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how about this?

1198
01:33:11,261 --> 01:33:13,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Great Big Rims, Itty Bitty Penis.

1199
01:33:14,974 --> 01:33:15,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1200
01:33:44,676 --> 01:33:45,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how can you forget her, right?

1201
01:33:45,917 --> 01:33:53,662
[SPEAKER_02]: She was the one on YouTube that her boyfriend taped her doing the whole hula hooping thing and obviously showing off her assets.

1202
01:33:54,222 --> 01:33:55,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very controversial.

1203
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:57,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Tyra Banks had that couple on the show.

1204
01:33:58,525 --> 01:34:05,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, Tyra helped this girl kind of get her revenge on the guy.

1205
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:12,675
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy was actually... The boyfriend was on the show playing and he actually...

1206
01:34:13,587 --> 01:34:14,568
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1207
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:50,227
[SPEAKER_13]: The only time I ever hear about the Tyra Banks show is when I'm watching the soup because they make fun of her because she's retarded.

1208
01:34:51,489 --> 01:34:51,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1209
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:59,217
[SPEAKER_13]: She did something way back with World of Warcraft where they destroyed some dude's CDs or something like that.

1210
01:34:59,497 --> 01:35:01,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you installed the game, you dipshit.

1211
01:35:04,477 --> 01:35:18,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually walked by at work and I saw that Tyra was on because they have a TV at work and they have different channels on during the day and I saw that the Tyra Banks show was on and I actually kind of looked up and I noticed they were showing the YouTube of the Wii Fit girl.

1212
01:35:18,186 --> 01:35:22,128
[SPEAKER_02]: She was getting ready to introduce her and I was kind of looking at it going, this must be a rerun.

1213
01:35:22,148 --> 01:35:23,309
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like 90 days old.

1214
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:25,350
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't.

1215
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:27,372
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a brand new episode.

1216
01:35:28,312 --> 01:35:29,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Too little, too late.

1217
01:35:29,673 --> 01:35:30,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Too little, too late.

1218
01:35:30,753 --> 01:35:35,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, late stories, I don't know about you guys, but they make me a little bit angsty.

1219
01:35:36,196 --> 01:35:38,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is when we get into the FUs of the week.

1220
01:35:54,244 --> 01:36:01,928
[SPEAKER_11]: My idea of the week goes towards my sinuses, my allergies, my lungs, and lots and lots of mucus.

1221
01:36:02,249 --> 01:36:03,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss having a voice.

1222
01:36:03,789 --> 01:36:07,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate having to eat or drink something hot just to be perfectly audible.

1223
01:36:08,652 --> 01:36:15,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, Rob... That's the only cool part of it.

1224
01:36:15,836 --> 01:36:16,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Old joke is old.

1225
01:36:17,357 --> 01:36:19,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki.

1226
01:36:20,519 --> 01:36:20,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1227
01:36:21,385 --> 01:36:27,671
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess my FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm going to have to wake up early tomorrow because I have to take my wife's car in.

1228
01:36:28,191 --> 01:36:38,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently she was driving down the street or whatever, doing 50 or something, and then the car all of a sudden stopped accelerating and the check engine light came on.

1229
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:41,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Then it started accelerating again, so that's usually not a good thing.

1230
01:36:43,344 --> 01:36:45,406
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I hate waking up early.

1231
01:36:47,606 --> 01:36:54,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my FU of the week goes to something I've been spending a lot of time on lately, and my FU of the week goes to Proposition 8.

1232
01:36:54,695 --> 01:37:04,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't usually get very politically motivated on the show, but seeing as this is something that directly affects my rights, and, you know, we've done this show for free for how long?

1233
01:37:04,226 --> 01:37:05,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon me while I get on my soapbox for a minute.

1234
01:37:06,648 --> 01:37:12,930
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in California, even if you don't live in California, please tell people that you know that live in California to vote no on Proposition 8.

1235
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:22,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposition 8 is basically an initiative on the ballot that's looking to ban same-sex marriage, which is already legal in California, thanks to a court decision a few months ago.

1236
01:37:23,854 --> 01:37:25,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in equality and fairness for all.

1237
01:37:26,475 --> 01:37:36,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, despite however a person might feel about gay marriage personally, it's not going to hurt you if two guys or two women get married and, you know, go on with their lives and raise a family.

1238
01:37:37,023 --> 01:37:46,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just, I think the whole thing is so stupid and I can't believe that people pour millions and millions of dollars into what I basically see as, in this opinion, hate.

1239
01:37:47,852 --> 01:37:51,134
[SPEAKER_02]: When I see people donating money to this YesOn8 campaign, I see hate.

1240
01:37:51,655 --> 01:37:52,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what it is.

1241
01:37:52,375 --> 01:37:54,297
[SPEAKER_02]: It's discrimination of the 21st century and it stinks.

1242
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:56,460
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also ignorance.

1243
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just ignorance.

1244
01:37:57,683 --> 01:37:58,184
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ignorant!

1245
01:37:58,424 --> 01:37:58,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

1246
01:38:00,413 --> 01:38:01,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, I could go on for days.

1247
01:38:01,854 --> 01:38:03,315
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, I fully agree with you.

1248
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:04,356
[SPEAKER_11]: It's absolutely disgusting.

1249
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:08,838
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, honestly, I would love to see marriage made illegal to begin with.

1250
01:38:10,019 --> 01:38:10,739
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

1251
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:11,100
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand.

1252
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:16,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Marriage be strictly reduced to a religious institution.

1253
01:38:17,344 --> 01:38:18,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Separation of church and state.

1254
01:38:18,985 --> 01:38:22,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Have that wall that Jefferson intended when he wrote the damn phrase.

1255
01:38:23,267 --> 01:38:23,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1256
01:38:24,268 --> 01:38:25,829
[SPEAKER_11]: And have the government should...

1257
01:38:26,349 --> 01:38:27,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1258
01:38:45,957 --> 01:38:50,262
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, it's very, very important that we defeat Proposition 8 on the ballot.

1259
01:38:50,302 --> 01:38:52,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It pisses me off that they lie.

1260
01:38:52,305 --> 01:38:53,146
[SPEAKER_02]: They freaking lie.

1261
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:59,513
[SPEAKER_02]: When they call people, they say that if this proposition is defeated, the churches are going to be forced to marry.

1262
01:38:59,593 --> 01:39:02,457
[SPEAKER_02]: That Mormon churches and churches that don't want to do it are going to be forced to marry.

1263
01:39:02,677 --> 01:39:03,438
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not true.

1264
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:04,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Churches are private organizations.

1265
01:39:04,419 --> 01:39:05,461
[SPEAKER_02]: It's straight up not true.

1266
01:39:05,561 --> 01:39:17,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's like, the Catholic Church, actually, they're very strict in who they can and can't marry, because they both have to be Catholic, as far as I'm aware, and all this other stuff is... No, you're absolutely right.

1267
01:39:18,037 --> 01:39:20,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's stupid and ridiculous.

1268
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,781
[SPEAKER_11]: We should dedicate a podcast just to it.

1269
01:39:22,961 --> 01:39:23,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1270
01:39:23,741 --> 01:39:24,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just go on for days and days and days.

1271
01:39:25,061 --> 01:39:25,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you know what?

1272
01:39:25,922 --> 01:39:32,043
[SPEAKER_02]: For those folks that think that gay marriage is going to ruin the sanctity of marriage, I've got three words for you.

1273
01:39:32,524 --> 01:39:33,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Britney fucking Spears.

1274
01:39:35,885 --> 01:39:36,125
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1275
01:39:36,165 --> 01:39:36,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to video games.

1276
01:39:37,265 --> 01:39:37,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Hug, hug, kiss, kiss.

1277
01:39:38,685 --> 01:39:39,226
[SPEAKER_13]: I love everybody.

1278
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:39,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do.

1279
01:39:39,986 --> 01:39:40,766
[SPEAKER_11]: You're so zilly.

1280
01:39:40,786 --> 01:39:41,526
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1281
01:39:42,046 --> 01:39:43,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Britney fucking Spears.

1282
01:39:43,107 --> 01:39:43,527
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.

1283
01:39:45,051 --> 01:39:45,732
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1284
01:39:45,992 --> 01:39:46,232
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1285
01:39:46,592 --> 01:39:46,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

1286
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:49,095
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another podcast.

1287
01:39:49,295 --> 01:39:51,137
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do a political podcast someday.

1288
01:39:51,217 --> 01:39:59,824
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I actually, actually, and I will go ahead and say this on the air, you know, because you know me, I'm very opinionated about my libertarian ideas.

1289
01:39:59,964 --> 01:40:00,225
[SPEAKER_02]: You?

1290
01:40:00,945 --> 01:40:01,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Opinionated?

1291
01:40:01,666 --> 01:40:01,706
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1292
01:40:01,726 --> 01:40:02,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

1293
01:40:02,367 --> 01:40:02,487
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1294
01:40:04,844 --> 01:40:05,945
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm just messing.

1295
01:40:06,225 --> 01:40:11,807
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe we should do some type of a new sub-podcast, a political cast.

1296
01:40:11,827 --> 01:40:15,048
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do something called, I don't know if Loki's down with it.

1297
01:40:15,489 --> 01:40:16,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Two pissed off nerds.

1298
01:40:16,629 --> 01:40:17,690
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we should call the show.

1299
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:18,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Two pissed off nerds.

1300
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:18,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined the ECA.

1301
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:19,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1302
01:40:19,631 --> 01:40:20,551
[SPEAKER_11]: I joined the ECA.

1303
01:40:21,291 --> 01:40:21,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.

1304
01:40:21,811 --> 01:40:23,412
[SPEAKER_11]: So we get lots of information from them.

1305
01:40:23,472 --> 01:40:23,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

1306
01:40:24,253 --> 01:40:24,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1307
01:40:25,053 --> 01:40:28,755
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's about time people put their foot down and said, screw you guys.

1308
01:40:28,955 --> 01:40:29,695
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going that way.

1309
01:40:29,915 --> 01:40:34,556
[SPEAKER_13]: No, and I'm pissed off that Comcast is limiting my bandwidth to 250 gigabytes a month.

1310
01:40:34,656 --> 01:40:35,116
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1311
01:40:35,156 --> 01:40:36,777
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something else to get pissed off about.

1312
01:40:36,797 --> 01:40:40,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different political thing, but yeah, that is angry.

1313
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:41,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.

1314
01:40:41,798 --> 01:40:42,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Two pissed off nerds.

1315
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:43,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if there's already a podcast.

1316
01:40:43,598 --> 01:40:44,139
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be.

1317
01:40:44,419 --> 01:40:46,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's one called Angry Nerds or something.

1318
01:40:46,699 --> 01:40:51,580
[SPEAKER_13]: They basically say that's 62,500 songs at 4 megabytes per song.

1319
01:40:51,801 --> 01:40:54,941
[SPEAKER_13]: That's basically 125 standard definition movies.

1320
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:55,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know what?

1321
01:40:56,142 --> 01:40:57,282
[SPEAKER_13]: I download that much.

1322
01:40:58,883 --> 01:40:59,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I don't.

1323
01:40:59,763 --> 01:41:04,305
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do monitor my downloading now.

1324
01:41:04,385 --> 01:41:05,526
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 says, pissed off nerds.

1325
01:41:05,566 --> 01:41:06,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be Under Sedation Live?

1326
01:41:07,106 --> 01:41:07,706
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.

1327
01:41:07,726 --> 01:41:09,067
[SPEAKER_02]: They might already have a corner on that market.

1328
01:41:09,087 --> 01:41:12,408
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have the angry video game nerd who's kind of retarded.

1329
01:41:12,488 --> 01:41:13,409
[SPEAKER_11]: But he's awesome.

1330
01:41:13,429 --> 01:41:16,510
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different, though, because that's actually about video games.

1331
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:21,992
[SPEAKER_11]: And he plays the games and talks shit about them, and they usually are shitty games.

1332
01:41:22,998 --> 01:41:25,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know what, I'm not going to state my opinion on the show.

1333
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:28,021
[SPEAKER_11]: He was the angry Nintendo nerd and he became the angry video game nerd.

1334
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:30,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fan of independent productions, we'll just leave it at that.

1335
01:41:30,763 --> 01:41:31,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, let's do it.

1336
01:41:32,744 --> 01:41:33,545
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look into it.

1337
01:41:33,585 --> 01:41:34,946
[SPEAKER_11]: When do Twin Powers activate?

1338
01:41:35,126 --> 01:41:36,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Form of a bucket.

1339
01:41:36,026 --> 01:41:37,027
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll explore the possibilities.

1340
01:41:37,067 --> 01:41:37,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, video games!

1341
01:41:38,128 --> 01:41:38,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

1342
01:41:38,968 --> 01:41:43,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess what's coming out on Virtual Console overseas?

1343
01:41:44,352 --> 01:41:47,974
[SPEAKER_11]: They're getting the Master System Sonic the Hedgehog.

1344
01:41:49,363 --> 01:41:52,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Commodore 64, Rob, Boulder Dash Jumpman

1345
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:12,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Jumpman Jr.

1346
01:42:12,972 --> 01:42:16,753
[SPEAKER_02]: was the first game I ever owned on my Commodore 64.

1347
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:21,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Jumpman, if I'm right, this is the Jumpman that led to us getting Donkey Kong.

1348
01:42:23,035 --> 01:42:23,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't it?

1349
01:42:23,415 --> 01:42:24,255
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way, yeah.

1350
01:42:24,295 --> 01:42:26,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar the way they were laid out.

1351
01:42:26,396 --> 01:42:31,358
[SPEAKER_11]: But the first hero in Donkey Kong was called Jumpman before he became Mario.

1352
01:42:31,898 --> 01:42:32,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember?

1353
01:42:32,802 --> 01:42:33,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Mouse Trap, didn't they?

1354
01:42:59,032 --> 01:43:00,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh... Yeah, they did Mousetrap.

1355
01:43:00,653 --> 01:43:01,073
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that game.

1356
01:43:01,093 --> 01:43:04,216
[SPEAKER_02]: They did, but I thought Epix did Jump... But they did Jumpman Jr.

1357
01:43:04,416 --> 01:43:05,037
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Epix.

1358
01:43:05,097 --> 01:43:07,119
[SPEAKER_11]: I was reading it wrong because I'm dead.

1359
01:43:07,299 --> 01:43:09,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Epix did, like, summer games and winter games.

1360
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:12,443
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a lot of great, great... Epix did a lot of games on Clicovision.

1361
01:43:13,344 --> 01:43:13,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1362
01:43:14,805 --> 01:43:16,627
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I played it on, was the Clicovision.

1363
01:43:17,187 --> 01:43:17,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1364
01:43:17,768 --> 01:43:20,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta play a little bit here of just some of the stuff from Jumpman Jr.,

1365
01:43:25,089 --> 01:43:28,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's Jumpman Jr., not Jumpman, but it's the same freaking thing.

1366
01:43:30,874 --> 01:43:33,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember setting it up to go really fast, and it was funny.

1367
01:43:34,357 --> 01:43:36,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can set your speed in this game.

1368
01:43:36,219 --> 01:43:40,903
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the amazing thing about it, is that, like, you could have the speed be so freaking fast, it was, like, unreal.

1369
01:43:43,946 --> 01:43:45,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So where's some actual gameplay noise?

1370
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:47,270
[SPEAKER_13]: I love that game.

1371
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:48,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this game was so amazing.

1372
01:43:49,571 --> 01:43:49,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1373
01:43:50,472 --> 01:43:52,973
[SPEAKER_02]: We're living in our little retro world.

1374
01:43:53,313 --> 01:43:54,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you have to avoid that killer dot.

1375
01:43:57,435 --> 01:43:57,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

1376
01:43:57,995 --> 01:43:58,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1377
01:43:58,396 --> 01:43:59,076
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done reminiscing.

1378
01:43:59,596 --> 01:44:00,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that game.

1379
01:44:01,237 --> 01:44:01,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

1380
01:44:01,977 --> 01:44:02,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1381
01:44:02,818 --> 01:44:04,419
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good virtual console update.

1382
01:44:05,699 --> 01:44:08,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's not fair that they get it there and we don't get it.

1383
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:08,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1384
01:44:08,981 --> 01:44:10,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I'm on my little boycott.

1385
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:12,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I might break my boycott for Jumpman, honestly.

1386
01:44:13,363 --> 01:44:13,863
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1387
01:44:14,803 --> 01:44:15,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we will, though.

1388
01:44:16,331 --> 01:44:17,391
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think.

1389
01:44:48,556 --> 01:44:49,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, only us.

1390
01:44:50,237 --> 01:44:54,561
[SPEAKER_13]: We can only make that transition from virtual console to porn.

1391
01:44:55,442 --> 01:44:58,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, so... From jacking off to PlayStation 3 news.

1392
01:44:58,964 --> 01:45:01,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

1393
01:45:03,008 --> 01:45:05,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Sony, how you make the funnies.

1394
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:14,137
[SPEAKER_13]: I seriously wonder if they're trying this on purpose now, but apparently the Sony PlayStation 3 just launched into the Malaysia region.

1395
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:20,418
[SPEAKER_13]: and during their little party that they were talking about

1396
01:45:21,772 --> 01:45:22,613
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1397
01:45:51,943 --> 01:45:53,044
[SPEAKER_13]: How did they not catch that?

1398
01:45:54,825 --> 01:45:56,546
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1399
01:45:56,586 --> 01:45:58,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Did someone just get the wrong CD in the mixer, maybe?

1400
01:45:59,688 --> 01:46:01,149
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a really wrong CD.

1401
01:46:01,169 --> 01:46:04,792
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that shouldn't have even been in the building, right?

1402
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:06,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1403
01:46:07,073 --> 01:46:07,934
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was kind of funny.

1404
01:46:08,154 --> 01:46:10,075
[SPEAKER_13]: They have the video on YouTube.

1405
01:46:10,095 --> 01:46:12,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely check it out because it's pretty funny.

1406
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:15,239
[SPEAKER_13]: That is it.

1407
01:46:16,229 --> 01:46:20,050
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, Kotaku ran the story, or one of the stories.

1408
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:22,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Even the Imperial Marshal would have been a better choice.

1409
01:46:25,092 --> 01:46:25,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1410
01:46:26,632 --> 01:46:30,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, every week on this program, we like to give you a chance to give us some feedback.

1411
01:46:30,813 --> 01:46:36,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just through the chat room at chat.orange.com or the phone calls, which we'll get to later, but through our mailbag.

1412
01:46:36,175 --> 01:46:42,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And every week you guys send us emails, and we pick a few of them to read on the show, or in tonight's case, we're probably going to read a lot of them on the show tonight, actually.

1413
01:46:44,157 --> 01:46:45,718
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a segment we call the OLR Mailbag.

1414
01:46:47,881 --> 01:46:49,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1415
01:47:15,222 --> 01:47:15,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Robway

1416
01:47:30,799 --> 01:47:33,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting theory, but would Kingdom Hearts be on the 360?

1417
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:34,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

1418
01:47:34,901 --> 01:47:37,322
[SPEAKER_02]: An Infinite Discovery, I think, is a 360 exclusive.

1419
01:47:37,682 --> 01:47:39,843
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be a killer exclusive.

1420
01:47:39,943 --> 01:47:44,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think most people have kind of already chalked up the fact that, and the rumors are saying that Kingdom Hearts is going to be on the 360.

1421
01:47:44,984 --> 01:47:50,607
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you remember, they develop all their games on PC, so it wouldn't matter anyways.

1422
01:47:50,627 --> 01:47:50,927
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1423
01:47:51,127 --> 01:47:52,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, absolutely.

1424
01:47:52,347 --> 01:47:55,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a cross-platform thing, but just something to think about.

1425
01:47:55,328 --> 01:47:56,529
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, he also wants to add a PS3.

1426
01:47:57,949 --> 01:48:02,391
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't yet played the game, early on in the game is a village called New Land.

1427
01:48:02,671 --> 01:48:03,811
[SPEAKER_02]: This is spoiler free, don't worry.

1428
01:48:04,211 --> 01:48:09,893
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to ensure you don't have to restart the game, save the game as soon as you find the save point.

1429
01:48:10,253 --> 01:48:13,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not overwrite that save until you have completed the task there.

1430
01:48:14,555 --> 01:48:18,116
[SPEAKER_02]: A tip from Rob with two Bs that might save some of you guys some headaches.

1431
01:48:19,666 --> 01:48:20,907
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another question here.

1432
01:48:21,508 --> 01:48:29,474
[SPEAKER_02]: This individual did not sign their email, but I think it's Spazinator, because I see it in the email address, even though I'm not going to give the whole email address, but we'll just say that.

1433
01:48:29,995 --> 01:48:31,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi folks, I have some questions for you again.

1434
01:48:31,476 --> 01:48:34,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you don't mind that most of them are of a semi-quasi-political in nature.

1435
01:48:34,859 --> 01:48:35,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, no, that's okay.

1436
01:48:35,579 --> 01:48:37,261
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of on a political tangent tonight.

1437
01:48:38,181 --> 01:48:43,526
[SPEAKER_02]: One, given that we're experiencing all this economic turmoil, do you see this affecting the video game industry in any way, shape, or form?

1438
01:48:45,034 --> 01:48:45,615
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

1439
01:48:45,735 --> 01:48:49,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Would the current economy situation affect the video game industry?

1440
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:54,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's a lot of banks that are going poor, so it's not like... I mean, people...

1441
01:48:56,215 --> 01:48:56,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1442
01:49:17,543 --> 01:49:21,105
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, and this is not the dumbest answer, in some ways yes, in some ways no.

1443
01:49:22,045 --> 01:49:26,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, because people have less disposable income and video games are funded by disposable income.

1444
01:49:26,847 --> 01:49:30,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, because video games are a global market, not just made for the U.S.

1445
01:49:30,909 --> 01:49:37,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think they're necessarily going to stop developing games because they still sell in Japan, they still sell in Europe and other countries and they might not be experiencing the same thing we're experiencing.

1446
01:49:37,892 --> 01:49:39,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So, something to think about.

1447
01:49:40,013 --> 01:49:53,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, with the election coming up not too long from now and given the fact that both Obama and McCain are in a virtual tie currently in polls, do you think either one of them will reach out to gamers, seeing as a good chunk of the population are gamers, most of which are old enough to vote?

1448
01:49:54,591 --> 01:49:55,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, you want my honest answer?

1449
01:49:56,253 --> 01:49:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1450
01:49:57,034 --> 01:49:57,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Voldemort

1451
01:50:12,131 --> 01:50:20,036
[SPEAKER_02]: and people that, you know, video games are bad and bloody and violent and, you know, it's that old mentality that Dungeons and Dragons makes people kill people in real life.

1452
01:50:20,477 --> 01:50:21,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that's still around.

1453
01:50:22,138 --> 01:50:30,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So, unfortunately, I don't think you're ever going to see Obama and McCain siding with the gamers in that respect because I think it would, for them, sadly, would do more harm than good.

1454
01:50:31,704 --> 01:50:43,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sad, don't get me wrong, but that's why it's important that gamers, you know, that's why things like ECA and so on are important because gamers get a voice, then gamers get their political clout known, etc., etc.,

1455
01:50:45,311 --> 01:50:50,752
[SPEAKER_02]: This one isn't so much a question, back to the email, as it is a random idea or a thought I had and would like to have you guys be my sounding board.

1456
01:50:51,052 --> 01:50:57,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it may be a decent idea if sometime down the road there was a political post, either on a volunteer basis or salaried, that had two functions?

1457
01:50:57,794 --> 01:51:02,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Advise the president on all things video game entertainment related and also did some public education on video games.

1458
01:51:02,875 --> 01:51:07,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically dispelling myths, misconceptions, stereotypes, and anything Jack Douchebag says about video games.

1459
01:51:08,116 --> 01:51:12,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking that if something like this was in place, perhaps things will eventually simmer down.

1460
01:51:13,378 --> 01:51:14,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like it is in place.

1461
01:51:14,559 --> 01:51:15,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the ECA.

1462
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:18,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not officially government sanctioned.

1463
01:51:18,302 --> 01:51:21,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're on the right track with what you're thinking about.

1464
01:51:21,864 --> 01:51:27,229
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, for the same reasons I stated before, you're not going to see the government just start to embrace video games like that.

1465
01:51:27,509 --> 01:51:27,989
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1466
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:34,715
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what you're talking about, that's the type of thing that the ECA is looking to bring awareness to.

1467
01:51:35,155 --> 01:51:39,278
[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out if you haven't already because I think they're looking for politically minded people like you.

1468
01:51:40,559 --> 01:51:40,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Agree?

1469
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:41,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Disagree?

1470
01:51:44,038 --> 01:51:44,278
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1471
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:45,299
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an I think so.

1472
01:51:45,459 --> 01:51:45,739
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1473
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to the next email.

1474
01:51:48,761 --> 01:51:51,783
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from IMAB.

1475
01:51:53,224 --> 01:51:53,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, OLR.

1476
01:51:54,005 --> 01:51:57,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you guys are still going to do Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

1477
01:51:57,868 --> 01:51:58,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, when is it?

1478
01:51:59,149 --> 01:52:02,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, keep up the great work, and I hope to see you guys in future cons.

1479
01:52:02,311 --> 01:52:03,812
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm afraid we may have missed it.

1480
01:52:04,232 --> 01:52:05,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot completely about it.

1481
01:52:05,533 --> 01:52:06,254
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't missed it yet.

1482
01:52:06,274 --> 01:52:07,094
[SPEAKER_13]: The game hasn't come out yet.

1483
01:52:07,134 --> 01:52:07,635
[SPEAKER_13]: It's moved.

1484
01:52:08,135 --> 01:52:10,457
[SPEAKER_13]: But I thought it was supposed to be the day after Silent Hill 2's release.

1485
01:52:11,751 --> 01:52:16,692
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I think we were doing, just to make it easy, the release of Silent Hill Homecoming.

1486
01:52:16,712 --> 01:52:18,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't Homecoming come out in like two weeks?

1487
01:52:18,993 --> 01:52:19,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's on the 30th.

1488
01:52:20,193 --> 01:52:26,455
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I always thought, oh, it's almost around that same time anyway, because September 25th, so that would be like in four days.

1489
01:52:26,775 --> 01:52:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

1490
01:52:26,935 --> 01:52:29,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like the day, no, I'm sorry, September 24th.

1491
01:52:29,275 --> 01:52:30,075
[SPEAKER_02]: 25th would be the Wednesday.

1492
01:52:30,476 --> 01:52:33,756
[SPEAKER_02]: September 24th was the day that it was originally released on the PlayStation 2 in 2001.

1493
01:52:33,816 --> 01:52:38,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, 25th would be, yeah, just do it on the 30th, it makes it easy.

1494
01:52:39,898 --> 01:52:40,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Or for Halloween.

1495
01:52:41,397 --> 01:52:42,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Play a Silent Hill game.

1496
01:52:56,947 --> 01:53:02,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Play a Silent Hill game like Silent Hill 2 that's really good, and then wait for our review after the game comes out.

1497
01:53:02,472 --> 01:53:05,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's good, you'll buy that too, and that's how you can praise Pyramid Head.

1498
01:53:06,035 --> 01:53:15,743
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do want to take little pictures of Pyramid Heads and send them in to us, or creative Pyramid Head usage in public, then I would love to run them on the front page of our site.

1499
01:53:15,803 --> 01:53:16,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be fun.

1500
01:53:17,904 --> 01:53:20,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe just kind of like a general end of September review.

1501
01:53:21,936 --> 01:53:26,600
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know about having a rape appreciation day, if people would like that too much.

1502
01:53:27,021 --> 01:53:28,702
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's only rape of monsters, remember.

1503
01:53:29,623 --> 01:53:30,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Not rape of humans.

1504
01:53:31,525 --> 01:53:31,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1505
01:53:33,627 --> 01:53:35,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go on to another email.

1506
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:40,252
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes from... Let's see...

1507
01:53:42,381 --> 01:53:42,982
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not signed.

1508
01:53:43,022 --> 01:53:43,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes it is.

1509
01:53:43,803 --> 01:53:44,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Geekboy2424.

1510
01:53:44,363 --> 01:53:46,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

1511
01:53:46,285 --> 01:53:47,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally got an Xbox 360.

1512
01:53:48,067 --> 01:53:49,229
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG, it is so awesome.

1513
01:53:49,269 --> 01:53:51,772
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even imagine the happy vibes coming off me right now.

1514
01:53:52,132 --> 01:53:53,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, what are your guys' gamer tags?

1515
01:53:53,674 --> 01:53:55,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll add you on live if you have any space on your friends list.

1516
01:53:56,277 --> 01:53:57,378
[SPEAKER_02]: My gamer tag is Geekboy2424.

1517
01:53:57,418 --> 01:53:59,320
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys on live.

1518
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:02,584
[SPEAKER_02]: This email is brought to you by me, home of the endless amounts of happiness.

1519
01:54:03,464 --> 01:54:05,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the forums in the Oil Army thread.

1520
01:54:05,446 --> 01:54:07,727
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole thread where we're exchanging gamer tags.

1521
01:54:08,128 --> 01:54:21,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, my friends list is full, but if you send me a really nice message, I'll usually try to find somebody on there who hasn't signed into Xbox Live in like 30 days and delete them to make room for new listeners or just somebody who I've never exchanged a message with or anything.

1522
01:54:21,817 --> 01:54:24,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, send me a message if you want.

1523
01:54:24,979 --> 01:54:27,861
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead of giving you the gamer tags out over the air, we're going to make it work for it.

1524
01:54:28,342 --> 01:54:30,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So head on over to the forums and check that out.

1525
01:54:31,263 --> 01:54:57,793
[SPEAKER_02]: or listen to a previous episode where we did give it out um I think there was one other email I wanted to read here and we're not going to be able to get to all the emails this week but I think we'll read this one and this will be the last one for tonight and it comes to us from Dan Shadow hey guys Dan Shadow here hope you all had a great talk like a pirate day this last Friday I had my fair share of grog I can tell you that hmm talk like a pirate day did you guys do anything to celebrate

1526
01:54:58,806 --> 01:54:59,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I said R once.

1527
01:55:00,088 --> 01:55:00,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't.

1528
01:55:00,669 --> 01:55:01,390
[SPEAKER_02]: R, matey.

1529
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:02,972
[SPEAKER_02]: You acted like one, though.

1530
01:55:03,472 --> 01:55:05,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I posted it on my Twitter.

1531
01:55:05,575 --> 01:55:08,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, ZeroDayLeetWares coming to my site.

1532
01:55:08,419 --> 01:55:09,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out, dudes.

1533
01:55:10,041 --> 01:55:11,403
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my talk like a pirate thing.

1534
01:55:12,144 --> 01:55:13,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Some...

1535
01:55:13,766 --> 01:55:14,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1536
01:55:40,621 --> 01:55:41,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Not necessarily.

1537
01:55:41,361 --> 01:55:44,522
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the driving's good in it, and it's not really a crappy game.

1538
01:55:44,642 --> 01:55:50,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, however, there are crappy minigames that they threw in there, like crappy bowling, crappy darts, and crappy billiards.

1539
01:55:51,644 --> 01:55:56,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that does suck, and that does feel very tacked on and is crappy.

1540
01:55:57,306 --> 01:55:57,926
[SPEAKER_13]: But the game itself?

1541
01:55:58,166 --> 01:55:58,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Fun.

1542
01:56:00,086 --> 01:56:03,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think that it's a crappy shooter and crappy driving game?

1543
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:05,592
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not at all.

1544
01:56:05,692 --> 01:56:12,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Having played some of the other multiplayer Grand Theft Auto games, which were only on PSP, unfortunately, they fixed a lot of things.

1545
01:56:12,198 --> 01:56:17,924
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of things they haven't fixed, but they each have their own little nuances.

1546
01:56:18,344 --> 01:56:20,326
[SPEAKER_13]: My problem with Grand Theft Auto is...

1547
01:56:20,967 --> 01:56:21,488
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1548
01:56:37,387 --> 01:56:43,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wonder if the developers are having problems with moving a genre forward without having to distract the gamer with aspects of more popular games.

1549
01:56:44,311 --> 01:56:49,433
[SPEAKER_02]: This has worked so far, but I don't want to see RPG elements in every single game, nor do I want to have a driver in my RPG.

1550
01:56:49,874 --> 01:56:57,237
[SPEAKER_02]: On the surface, you'll see big-time shooters that are hardcore on the surface, but once you go online, you're riddled with customization, experience points, and guild systems.

1551
01:56:58,038 --> 01:56:59,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you think the genres are going?

1552
01:56:59,899 --> 01:57:03,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's room for more than one great single genre game each year?

1553
01:57:05,314 --> 01:57:18,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but you know what the problem is, I think, and thanks for your email, I think a big part of the problem is that because of the way Christmas is, a lot of games get overlooked because they all come out between September to December.

1554
01:57:18,381 --> 01:57:22,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I think more great games will get recognized if they would learn how to evenly space them out throughout the year.

1555
01:57:22,623 --> 01:57:24,164
[SPEAKER_02]: They're starting to get that.

1556
01:57:24,544 --> 01:57:28,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a little bit, yes, but my god, I feel overwhelmed right now with all the games I want to play.

1557
01:57:29,106 --> 01:57:29,687
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, really.

1558
01:57:30,687 --> 01:57:48,431
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing too also is that what they're trying to do is attract more people to their game and the problem is if they keep putting out the same game and not trying to incorporate these little elements that maybe will attract an RPG player or maybe will attract someone who's really into bowling or something.

1559
01:57:50,031 --> 01:57:51,332
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really what they're trying to do.

1560
01:57:51,372 --> 01:57:53,272
[SPEAKER_13]: They're trying to branch out a little bit.

1561
01:57:53,352 --> 01:57:56,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the real problem comes down to these companies putting out games that aren't

1562
01:57:57,213 --> 01:57:58,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1563
01:58:03,442 --> 01:58:03,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything.

1564
01:58:04,103 --> 01:58:04,963
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, seriously.

1565
01:58:05,103 --> 01:58:06,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Mercenaries 2, what the fuck?

1566
01:58:06,765 --> 01:58:07,965
[SPEAKER_13]: That game is not done.

1567
01:58:08,025 --> 01:58:12,429
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no way that they can say, oh yeah, we've ironed out all the bugs in that one.

1568
01:58:12,529 --> 01:58:13,209
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they did not.

1569
01:58:13,369 --> 01:58:24,197
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, they probably will just look at it, figure out what's wrong with it, and then later on they can go patch it because it made better business sense for them at the time to release it when they did because there wasn't a lot coming out around then.

1570
01:58:24,377 --> 01:58:26,539
[SPEAKER_13]: And they figure they're going to get a lot more sales that way.

1571
01:58:26,559 --> 01:58:28,601
[SPEAKER_13]: At the same time, people say their game is shit.

1572
01:58:29,381 --> 01:58:31,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting comment from Xenocore in our chatroom.

1573
01:58:32,282 --> 01:58:35,503
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is the same reason we all have these big budget games.

1574
01:58:35,903 --> 01:58:37,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many suits in the industry.

1575
01:58:38,744 --> 01:58:41,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of curious to see what XNA is going to do to all of this.

1576
01:58:41,905 --> 01:58:42,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep talking about it.

1577
01:58:42,745 --> 01:58:44,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think this is going to be a big freaking deal.

1578
01:58:44,785 --> 01:58:46,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I make a big deal about it on the show, but come on.

1579
01:58:47,446 --> 01:58:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is a distribution platform for independent games to really get noticed.

1580
01:58:51,707 --> 01:58:53,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very curious to see what this does to gaming.

1581
01:58:54,594 --> 01:58:55,955
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, I could be wrong.

1582
01:58:56,335 --> 01:58:58,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have the impact of just a little pebble.

1583
01:58:58,657 --> 01:59:01,759
[SPEAKER_13]: I think if they do anything right, it could be a big volcano, too.

1584
01:59:01,799 --> 01:59:09,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hate to say this, like the Apple App Store, where a lot of people are putting stuff on there, and it spreads like wildfire really quick.

1585
01:59:09,565 --> 01:59:15,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of the reason why, sorry, Loki, but the iPhone is murdering, is because you don't see that type of...

1586
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:26,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure some angry emailer who's anti-Apple and pro-Sprint or whatever is going to email me telling me about things I'm not considering.

1587
01:59:26,496 --> 01:59:35,021
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever, Apple's doing a great job marketing their marketplace and getting it out there that any idiot can make these applications.

1588
01:59:35,061 --> 01:59:39,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are very exciting, like the whole built-in Twitter and just everything they've got.

1589
01:59:41,074 --> 01:59:41,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1590
01:59:42,055 --> 01:59:46,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's part of why the iPhone's kicking a lot of butt and why everybody really wants one.

1591
01:59:47,097 --> 01:59:48,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not everybody, but a lot of people.

1592
01:59:48,817 --> 01:59:49,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that was it for Mailbag.

1593
01:59:49,858 --> 01:59:52,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, why don't you send us an email for consideration to be read up next week.

1594
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:56,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com Very sorry to those emails we didn't get to this week.

1595
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:57,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Just realized we didn't run out of time.

1596
01:59:58,181 --> 02:00:01,362
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did read them all and we lulled at your improper grammar.

1597
02:00:01,943 --> 02:00:02,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

1598
02:00:02,603 --> 02:00:04,143
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also praised you when you had good grammar.

1599
02:00:04,904 --> 02:00:05,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get back to some gaming news.

1600
02:00:05,864 --> 02:00:06,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

1601
02:00:06,364 --> 02:00:06,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1602
02:00:07,565 --> 02:00:10,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the big trend now is to release...

1603
02:00:10,936 --> 02:00:12,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1604
02:00:36,085 --> 02:00:59,078
[SPEAKER_13]: so we'll have to see if this actually ends up happening because you know like other games like Halo it doesn't end up coming out so yeah I think great let's see if there's a good quality movie made here but unfortunately so far track record hasn't been too favorable I am I do have a little bit of

1605
02:01:00,302 --> 02:01:01,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Postal was not good.

1606
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:27,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Far Cry Far Cry Far Cry Far Cry

1607
02:01:51,047 --> 02:01:57,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm waiting for the fluke to happen where all of a sudden it's just cinematic mastery, but it's not.

1608
02:01:57,911 --> 02:01:59,132
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really not going to be good.

1609
02:01:59,412 --> 02:02:02,394
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, TigerClaw reminds me of something I read on the internet this week.

1610
02:02:02,634 --> 02:02:05,896
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, oh, speaking of Weibull, he's also coming out with his own video game.

1611
02:02:05,916 --> 02:02:06,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear about that?

1612
02:02:07,036 --> 02:02:08,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Tunnel Rats.

1613
02:02:09,037 --> 02:02:11,419
[SPEAKER_13]: When we interviewed him, he actually talked about that a little bit.

1614
02:02:11,639 --> 02:02:13,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's supposed to be coming out next year.

1615
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:15,141
[SPEAKER_13]: They had a trailer for the game.

1616
02:02:16,627 --> 02:02:19,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Which looks okay, I guess.

1617
02:02:19,328 --> 02:02:22,509
[SPEAKER_13]: It looked kind of boring, but the graphics were alright.

1618
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:29,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if ruining one entertainment genre wasn't enough... Or as Actdeft calls him, Uwe Balls.

1619
02:02:30,473 --> 02:02:33,754
[SPEAKER_13]: He really just needs to find his niche that he's good at.

1620
02:02:33,894 --> 02:02:35,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, games aren't it.

1621
02:02:36,075 --> 02:02:39,196
[SPEAKER_13]: And he just really wants to use games because it's an excuse to make genre films.

1622
02:02:39,216 --> 02:02:41,097
[SPEAKER_02]: How about meditating, far away from here?

1623
02:02:41,738 --> 02:02:42,218
[SPEAKER_02]: What's his niche?

1624
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:42,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Sucking.

1625
02:02:45,011 --> 02:02:50,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he just wants to make genre films, but it's kind of like, oh, I just want to play around with making movies.

1626
02:02:51,042 --> 02:02:52,765
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not even really that serious about it.

1627
02:02:52,945 --> 02:02:58,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee suggests in chatroom the wonderfully mature name of Boobway Balls.

1628
02:03:01,243 --> 02:03:02,064
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1629
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,481
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't help but turn your head and go, I wonder how bad it is.

1630
02:03:20,681 --> 02:03:24,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we have to warn people, because there are some people that are like, ooh, Far Cry.

1631
02:03:25,282 --> 02:03:26,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, Far Cry, video game movie.

1632
02:03:27,402 --> 02:03:37,464
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, sadly enough, the thing is, obviously we can't reach a lot of people, but the people that listen to us can reach their friends, and their friends will reach their friends.

1633
02:03:37,864 --> 02:03:44,286
[SPEAKER_13]: And eventually, more of these movies will make it less into the theaters, more direct-to-video, and less people will buy them.

1634
02:03:44,986 --> 02:03:51,012
[SPEAKER_13]: because unfortunately these sell like crazy on DVD and I don't know why because people apparently are stupid.

1635
02:03:51,052 --> 02:03:52,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people like their bad movie collection.

1636
02:03:53,254 --> 02:03:55,616
[SPEAKER_11]: It's MST3K syndrome, right?

1637
02:03:55,817 --> 02:03:56,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1638
02:03:56,457 --> 02:03:56,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1639
02:03:57,058 --> 02:04:02,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually wanting to know if any of those riff tracks have been done to an Uwe Boll film because I bet that would be funny.

1640
02:04:03,464 --> 02:04:04,105
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

1641
02:04:04,705 --> 02:04:05,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1642
02:04:06,782 --> 02:04:12,427
[SPEAKER_11]: For people who are Sega fans like myself, there are actually going to be a new game coming out.

1643
02:04:13,267 --> 02:04:17,411
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Harley-Davidson King of the Road.

1644
02:04:17,431 --> 02:04:22,896
[SPEAKER_11]: They did Harley-Davidson and LA Riders not too long ago, like 10 years ago.

1645
02:04:24,577 --> 02:04:45,155
[SPEAKER_11]: but now they're going to have it on a full-size Harley on a 62-inch screen and it's going to have a very 70s rock soundtrack with Deep Purple and Steppenwolf and it was on display at the Tokyo Amusement Show.

1646
02:04:46,176 --> 02:04:49,379
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want... Awesome.

1647
02:04:50,626 --> 02:04:53,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Harley Games Elevator Action Elevator Action

1648
02:05:20,208 --> 02:05:20,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1649
02:05:20,388 --> 02:05:20,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1650
02:05:46,676 --> 02:05:47,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1651
02:05:47,196 --> 02:05:48,277
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the question of the day.

1652
02:05:48,537 --> 02:05:49,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta know.

1653
02:05:50,378 --> 02:05:54,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Australian folks, did I just insult you by saying folk?

1654
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:55,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what I want to know.

1655
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:58,661
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm very, very curious about.

1656
02:05:58,841 --> 02:06:01,062
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it so insulting about city folk?

1657
02:06:02,643 --> 02:06:03,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Folk you, Rob.

1658
02:06:04,264 --> 02:06:05,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's it.

1659
02:06:06,085 --> 02:06:06,485
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1660
02:06:08,446 --> 02:06:11,867
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing I was going to say, well, I mean, they've done this in the past with other games.

1661
02:06:11,907 --> 02:06:16,109
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, another perfect example would be in the Asian region after

1662
02:06:17,097 --> 02:06:21,180
[SPEAKER_13]: is no longer known as Africa, it's known as Hakuna Matata.

1663
02:06:41,158 --> 02:06:41,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney will sue.

1664
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:45,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Xenocore says it's now known as Jumbo Safari.

1665
02:06:45,302 --> 02:06:47,905
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they're going to sell more copies of it.

1666
02:06:47,985 --> 02:06:48,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish.

1667
02:06:49,226 --> 02:06:49,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish.

1668
02:06:50,507 --> 02:06:51,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well one more story for you guys.

1669
02:06:51,949 --> 02:06:53,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to open up our Skype line.

1670
02:06:53,651 --> 02:06:57,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can call us at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1671
02:06:59,256 --> 02:07:02,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a story about EA, Microsoft, and GameStop.

1672
02:07:02,439 --> 02:07:04,061
[SPEAKER_02]: What do these three companies have in common?

1673
02:07:04,442 --> 02:07:11,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they were recently awarded perfect scores for the treatment of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender employees.

1674
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:14,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.

1675
02:07:15,493 --> 02:07:19,037
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all in the 2009 Corporate Equity Index.

1676
02:07:20,157 --> 02:07:28,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a comment on this from GamePolitics.com, a comment from the president of the HRC Foundation, Joel Solmones.

1677
02:07:28,962 --> 02:07:41,948
[SPEAKER_02]: The 2009 Corporate Equality Index shows that corporate America understands that a diverse workforce is critical to remaining successful and competitive in the absence of a federal law that prohibits workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression.

1678
02:07:42,368 --> 02:07:43,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1679
02:08:03,018 --> 02:08:03,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

1680
02:08:04,778 --> 02:08:08,159
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of sad, but you might be thinking, well, why is this news?

1681
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:14,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sadly, there are some companies out there where it's okay to discriminate based on that stuff.

1682
02:08:14,541 --> 02:08:17,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's time to get out of your cave.

1683
02:08:17,542 --> 02:08:21,463
[SPEAKER_13]: And really, to be honest, GameStop, they just treat everyone like shit.

1684
02:08:23,203 --> 02:08:23,963
[SPEAKER_13]: But at least it's fair.

1685
02:08:23,983 --> 02:08:24,984
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't discriminate, though.

1686
02:08:25,044 --> 02:08:25,784
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it's fair.

1687
02:08:25,925 --> 02:08:27,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody is treated equally.

1688
02:08:27,746 --> 02:08:31,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is treated like shit, so at least it's non-discriminatory.

1689
02:08:31,047 --> 02:08:31,888
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the important thing.

1690
02:08:32,508 --> 02:08:35,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm fine with that, as long as everybody's treated like shit.

1691
02:08:35,670 --> 02:08:44,815
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, we're going to treat you like shit now when you call us at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1692
02:08:44,855 --> 02:08:45,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

1693
02:08:45,315 --> 02:08:47,796
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't treat you like shit unless you deserve it.

1694
02:08:48,697 --> 02:08:51,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, do you have any last-minute stories, Loki?

1695
02:08:52,738 --> 02:08:53,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I do have a few.

1696
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:57,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Some stuff that didn't make our show roll this week.

1697
02:08:59,343 --> 02:09:08,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, there was an ISO loader being in development for the homebrew community, much to the dislike of the homebrew community.

1698
02:09:09,291 --> 02:09:12,853
[SPEAKER_13]: And the developer, Wanicoco, apparently...

1699
02:09:14,269 --> 02:09:16,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It got leaked out, which is not good.

1700
02:09:16,731 --> 02:09:20,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And now the developer said, you ain't getting the full version then, so fuck you all.

1701
02:09:21,235 --> 02:09:21,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Yikes.

1702
02:09:21,856 --> 02:09:23,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go to the phone real quick and then we'll come back to the story.

1703
02:09:23,878 --> 02:09:24,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1704
02:09:24,758 --> 02:09:25,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1705
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:27,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Yo, what up, guys?

1706
02:09:27,081 --> 02:09:28,262
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.

1707
02:09:28,522 --> 02:09:30,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Xenocore from Ultimate Quest.

1708
02:09:30,063 --> 02:09:31,044
[SPEAKER_02]: What is on your mind, my friend?

1709
02:09:32,245 --> 02:09:32,986
[SPEAKER_15]: A few things.

1710
02:09:33,106 --> 02:09:36,909
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, duck the new Knight Rider for public safety type thing, you know.

1711
02:09:37,070 --> 02:09:37,930
[SPEAKER_15]: Duck it, duck it, duck it.

1712
02:09:38,211 --> 02:09:39,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

1713
02:09:39,532 --> 02:09:40,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that premiere tonight or something?

1714
02:09:41,602 --> 02:09:46,123
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but I caught it on Hulu, and it's like, how many sharks can you jump in one show?

1715
02:09:46,243 --> 02:09:48,324
[SPEAKER_15]: My God, are you going for a world record or something?

1716
02:09:48,564 --> 02:09:49,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't even have David Hasselhoff.

1717
02:09:49,424 --> 02:09:50,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody call back Hasselhoff.

1718
02:09:50,225 --> 02:09:51,485
[SPEAKER_15]: He knows how to do the show.

1719
02:09:52,765 --> 02:09:54,666
[SPEAKER_02]: No Hasselhoff equals instant fail.

1720
02:09:54,826 --> 02:09:57,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it doesn't take a genius to recognize that.

1721
02:09:58,607 --> 02:10:09,751
[SPEAKER_15]: The only cool thing I liked in there was, even though I disliked the whole mission support type thing going on, the one Asian chick in there that speaks nine languages that's always throwing off one-liners is hilarious.

1722
02:10:09,791 --> 02:10:11,191
[SPEAKER_15]: But other than that, that show's garbage.

1723
02:10:11,351 --> 02:10:14,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Potential for a good video game out of the new Knight Rider series?

1724
02:10:15,232 --> 02:10:15,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Hell no.

1725
02:10:15,752 --> 02:10:16,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Too many effects.

1726
02:10:16,953 --> 02:10:18,973
[SPEAKER_15]: They put ground effects on Kit for crying out loud.

1727
02:10:19,093 --> 02:10:22,774
[SPEAKER_15]: He jumped over guys and there's glowing on the bottom that said KR.

1728
02:10:23,134 --> 02:10:25,255
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, what, this thing run through the hood or something?

1729
02:10:25,275 --> 02:10:25,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Get some rims?

1730
02:10:26,275 --> 02:10:27,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I miss spinning?

1731
02:10:27,476 --> 02:10:30,837
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, good lord, how much crap can you bolt on him?

1732
02:10:31,357 --> 02:10:34,398
[SPEAKER_15]: And he transformed into an F-150 of all things.

1733
02:10:34,478 --> 02:10:35,998
[SPEAKER_15]: My god, I got so much hate for this show.

1734
02:10:36,178 --> 02:10:38,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well look, I know you didn't call in just to bash on Knight Rider.

1735
02:10:38,739 --> 02:10:40,119
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on here?

1736
02:10:40,679 --> 02:10:54,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, from what I've seen of the new Knight Rider show, I thought the little TV movie that they did that kind of piloted the thing, I thought it was pretty good.

1737
02:10:54,804 --> 02:10:55,824
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't know.

1738
02:10:56,684 --> 02:10:59,225
[SPEAKER_15]: I did have hope until I saw episode one.

1739
02:11:00,685 --> 02:11:02,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless the Hoff's involved, I'm not watching it anymore.

1740
02:11:03,386 --> 02:11:04,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you didn't call in to talk just about Knight Rider.

1741
02:11:04,927 --> 02:11:05,827
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on the gaming world?

1742
02:11:07,509 --> 02:11:09,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, have you played Warhammer Online yet?

1743
02:11:09,192 --> 02:11:09,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.

1744
02:11:09,492 --> 02:11:10,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1745
02:11:10,213 --> 02:11:13,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you came into the show late tonight, but I talked about it during my gaming week in Part A.

1746
02:11:14,782 --> 02:11:15,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I kind of missed that.

1747
02:11:15,843 --> 02:11:16,824
[SPEAKER_15]: I was busy with some stuff.

1748
02:11:16,904 --> 02:11:17,344
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's alright.

1749
02:11:17,364 --> 02:11:18,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm liking it so far, man.

1750
02:11:19,745 --> 02:11:20,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like it?

1751
02:11:20,306 --> 02:11:20,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's my thing.

1752
02:11:21,186 --> 02:11:22,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some likes and I had some dislikes.

1753
02:11:22,727 --> 02:11:26,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked some of the new things that Warhammer brought to the table, especially in the PvP area.

1754
02:11:26,929 --> 02:11:29,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked some of the RVR combat that I played.

1755
02:11:29,611 --> 02:11:31,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought some of the scenarios were pretty awesome.

1756
02:11:31,492 --> 02:11:36,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked the idea of the public questing, but I thought the interface was very clunky.

1757
02:11:36,535 --> 02:11:37,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's just me.

1758
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:43,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the interface to be really clunky, especially compared to some more fluid interfaces that I've used.

1759
02:11:43,639 --> 02:11:43,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Well,

1760
02:11:44,793 --> 02:11:48,915
[SPEAKER_15]: The interface for me, I actually was able to manage all the information well.

1761
02:11:49,075 --> 02:11:54,458
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, maybe it's because I'm used to looking at cluttered screens, but I saw everything I needed to see in there.

1762
02:11:54,478 --> 02:11:55,878
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't need to pull up a disk.

1763
02:11:56,058 --> 02:12:01,161
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like if they would have buried it into a window that you have to pull up, nobody would really want to use it.

1764
02:12:01,481 --> 02:12:09,004
[SPEAKER_15]: I just put everything up there, just make the colors bright enough to where you can still see the stuff, even though it's just like one or two pixels wide, and it works.

1765
02:12:09,645 --> 02:12:12,426
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can still see a lot of the game and have all the information that you need.

1766
02:12:13,127 --> 02:12:18,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus a lot of the stuff for the interface that they included on the backend, like highlighting quest areas and everything else, I thought was kind of brilliant.

1767
02:12:19,749 --> 02:12:27,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's kind of a nice plus, is that it actually kind of shows you where to go for quests, which, you know, you might be thinking, well, it's helping you cheat on the game, but you know what?

1768
02:12:27,512 --> 02:12:29,153
[SPEAKER_02]: God, people do that with WoW all the time.

1769
02:12:29,173 --> 02:12:33,294
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're just looking up online how to beat the quests, so, you know, why not build it into the game a little bit?

1770
02:12:34,535 --> 02:12:38,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like people aren't going to tell you specifically where to go or show you on your app.

1771
02:12:38,556 --> 02:12:40,077
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it works in the roleplay sense.

1772
02:12:40,997 --> 02:12:41,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1773
02:12:41,735 --> 02:12:43,256
[SPEAKER_15]: But orcs are finally done right.

1774
02:12:43,356 --> 02:12:45,418
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the way orcs are supposed to be, people.

1775
02:12:45,858 --> 02:12:48,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Blizzard stole it from Games Workshop.

1776
02:12:48,841 --> 02:12:50,382
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the way they're supposed to be.

1777
02:12:50,842 --> 02:12:54,465
[SPEAKER_15]: You must be a chaos player.

1778
02:12:56,046 --> 02:12:56,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I am.

1779
02:12:57,667 --> 02:13:01,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried the human side and was like, this is boring.

1780
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:02,431
[SPEAKER_15]: I do this and wow.

1781
02:13:02,471 --> 02:13:04,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me switch over to the other one.

1782
02:13:04,653 --> 02:13:06,795
[SPEAKER_15]: All the dark elves listen to metal.

1783
02:13:06,815 --> 02:13:08,056
[SPEAKER_15]: They refuse to dance.

1784
02:13:08,816 --> 02:13:09,617
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the way it should be.

1785
02:13:11,446 --> 02:13:12,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing a high elf.

1786
02:13:12,547 --> 02:13:13,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been kind of fun.

1787
02:13:13,628 --> 02:13:15,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like I'm going around judging everyone.

1788
02:13:15,829 --> 02:13:16,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

1789
02:13:17,690 --> 02:13:18,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I loved it.

1790
02:13:18,630 --> 02:13:22,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time I clicked on Slash Dance, it's like, so-and-so refuses to dance.

1791
02:13:22,733 --> 02:13:24,133
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the way it should be, right there.

1792
02:13:24,313 --> 02:13:26,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you suggesting that your night elf is Judge Dredd?

1793
02:13:28,416 --> 02:13:30,797
[SPEAKER_15]: No, she's more of Judge Hershey, actually.

1794
02:13:30,857 --> 02:13:31,617
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, whatever.

1795
02:13:33,058 --> 02:13:34,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the one on Divorce Court?

1796
02:13:36,139 --> 02:13:38,840
[SPEAKER_15]: No, there's a Judge Hershey in Judge Dredge, just a female one.

1797
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:41,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, okay, I'm thinking, okay, I'm thinking a TV show.

1798
02:13:41,981 --> 02:13:45,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I noticed a female one, but whatever.

1799
02:13:45,382 --> 02:13:46,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're liking Warhammer Online.

1800
02:13:47,003 --> 02:13:55,025
[SPEAKER_02]: For somebody that's never played an MMO before in their life, let's say they're just turned off by the whole MMO idea, is there anything for them in Warhammer that might change their mind?

1801
02:13:55,906 --> 02:14:00,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, this is a good gateway drug for a WoW-like experience, definitely.

1802
02:14:00,267 --> 02:14:03,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially with the public quests, you get to see what a large...

1803
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:04,881
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1804
02:14:28,428 --> 02:14:45,523
[SPEAKER_15]: and also when you go Realm vs. Realm, like if you actually go into the closed capture the flag and stuff like that, they took a note from City of Heroes and sidekick you up to an appropriate level so that way you can actually do something at level one if you wanted to.

1805
02:14:45,643 --> 02:14:46,484
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so funny.

1806
02:14:46,544 --> 02:14:47,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought up the same point.

1807
02:14:47,785 --> 02:14:48,686
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was great too.

1808
02:14:49,106 --> 02:14:49,687
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was great.

1809
02:14:50,768 --> 02:14:52,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but that's all I had, guys.

1810
02:14:52,269 --> 02:14:53,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

1811
02:14:53,801 --> 02:14:57,925
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate your phone call and appreciate the review on Warhammer Online.

1812
02:14:58,586 --> 02:15:01,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, not a lot of folks, it sounds like, have checked it out yet.

1813
02:15:02,229 --> 02:15:04,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick plug for your show, then we'll take another call.

1814
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:07,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimate Quest, every Thursday after Video Game Outsiders.

1815
02:15:07,855 --> 02:15:10,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Give us a listen and give us some feedback.

1816
02:15:11,698 --> 02:15:12,739
[SPEAKER_02]: What topics on the show this week?

1817
02:15:12,799 --> 02:15:13,320
[SPEAKER_02]: More Warhammer?

1818
02:15:14,818 --> 02:15:22,323
[SPEAKER_15]: This week we're kind of on hiatus, mainly due to real life issues, but we plan on doing another show next week, and hopefully I'll have some new content for you by then.

1819
02:15:22,763 --> 02:15:28,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, tell your listeners, we need more banners on the OLR PSP All Games Radio player.

1820
02:15:28,246 --> 02:15:29,467
[SPEAKER_13]: So we need an Ultimate Quest banner.

1821
02:15:29,667 --> 02:15:30,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1822
02:15:30,167 --> 02:15:32,048
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to make it happen.

1823
02:15:32,088 --> 02:15:35,110
[SPEAKER_15]: As soon as Foodie's done with his thesis, I'll flog him and get him right on it.

1824
02:15:35,310 --> 02:15:35,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, sounds good.

1825
02:15:36,691 --> 02:15:37,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Take care, Xenobor.

1826
02:15:38,392 --> 02:15:38,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1827
02:15:39,653 --> 02:15:45,157
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a great radio voice, too, so you know that show is gonna be fun, because you can hear him calling in R's, you can just tell.

1828
02:15:45,517 --> 02:15:53,022
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's certain people that call in this show that have really good radio voices, like VX Jason's another good one, Rob D. Bobby's got a great radio voice.

1829
02:15:53,782 --> 02:15:55,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby has a wonderful radio voice.

1830
02:15:55,023 --> 02:15:55,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop being mean.

1831
02:15:56,906 --> 02:15:58,648
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just mad because he censors you on his show.

1832
02:15:58,929 --> 02:15:59,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

1833
02:16:00,070 --> 02:16:04,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wouldn't be your friend on PlayStation Network or something.

1834
02:16:04,075 --> 02:16:04,536
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

1835
02:16:04,996 --> 02:16:06,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, more calls.

1836
02:16:06,598 --> 02:16:09,902
[SPEAKER_02]: 877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1837
02:16:09,922 --> 02:16:12,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there any more to the mod story you were talking about?

1838
02:16:14,148 --> 02:16:15,650
[SPEAKER_13]: No, just that I'm not going to finish it now.

1839
02:16:17,173 --> 02:16:19,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Fine, be that way, asshole.

1840
02:16:19,654 --> 02:16:21,456
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have something real quick, and this is awesome.

1841
02:16:22,356 --> 02:16:30,641
[SPEAKER_13]: What show, or I should say, what game had a show that was on PBS with a doo-wop group that is now going to be on the DS?

1842
02:16:31,301 --> 02:16:34,483
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego coming to the DS?

1843
02:16:34,503 --> 02:16:34,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes!

1844
02:16:35,083 --> 02:16:35,844
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

1845
02:16:36,764 --> 02:16:38,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it have the doo-wop group?

1846
02:16:38,805 --> 02:16:40,266
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it does not have the doo-wop group.

1847
02:16:40,506 --> 02:16:41,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Find it, find it, find it, find it.

1848
02:16:42,137 --> 02:16:43,600
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an adventure game with a learning curve.

1849
02:16:44,722 --> 02:16:48,369
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got high-standing 3D graphics.

1850
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:53,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never heard that description before, but coming sometime soon.

1851
02:16:53,939 --> 02:16:54,240
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1852
02:16:54,881 --> 02:16:55,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Where?

1853
02:16:56,002 --> 02:16:58,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Rockapella.

1854
02:16:58,344 --> 02:16:59,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I want this fucking song in Rock Band.

1855
02:17:00,045 --> 02:17:02,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I realize there's no guitar or drums.

1856
02:17:03,028 --> 02:17:04,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a shit.

1857
02:17:20,712 --> 02:17:29,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Carmen Sandiego God, I loved Carmen Sandiego.

1858
02:17:29,835 --> 02:17:32,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just the show, but the game itself was actually a shitload of fun.

1859
02:17:32,296 --> 02:17:33,557
[SPEAKER_13]: They also had a cool cartoon series.

1860
02:17:34,037 --> 02:17:34,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1861
02:17:34,837 --> 02:17:40,539
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the best theme song to any game show ever.

1862
02:17:43,444 --> 02:17:44,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, love it.

1863
02:17:44,625 --> 02:17:46,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Our phone's not really ringing tonight.

1864
02:17:46,105 --> 02:17:48,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we have a very apathetic... Someone call us!

1865
02:17:48,306 --> 02:17:49,627
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a very apathetic crowd tonight.

1866
02:17:49,647 --> 02:17:50,547
[SPEAKER_02]: At least one more call.

1867
02:17:50,627 --> 02:17:54,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no offense to Xenocore, but I don't want him to be the only one that's on the show tonight.

1868
02:17:55,290 --> 02:18:06,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, Wiis are going to be harder to mod now that they are being... Some of their drive ICs are now being encased in epoxy, so you actually have to dissolve that shit before you can mod it.

1869
02:18:06,815 --> 02:18:09,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Or you can use one of the contacts on the bottom of the board.

1870
02:18:09,116 --> 02:18:11,257
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not impossible, but just making it a little harder.

1871
02:18:12,517 --> 02:18:27,367
[SPEAKER_13]: and if you're not into booting say backed up games you can still do import games with a bunch of new stuff including Gecko OS version 1.07 which will now allow you to boot import games without a mod chip.

1872
02:18:29,489 --> 02:18:32,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello Ranma, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, what's up?

1873
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:34,301
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1874
02:18:52,943 --> 02:18:53,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1875
02:18:53,744 --> 02:18:54,364
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

1876
02:18:54,384 --> 02:18:54,985
[SPEAKER_02]: What a shock.

1877
02:18:55,405 --> 02:18:57,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Why four?

1878
02:18:57,706 --> 02:18:58,187
[SPEAKER_02]: What now?

1879
02:18:58,247 --> 02:18:59,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get out the list.

1880
02:18:59,568 --> 02:19:02,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we should actually, you know what we should have?

1881
02:19:02,810 --> 02:19:03,210
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

1882
02:19:03,270 --> 02:19:04,131
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I want to do?

1883
02:19:04,231 --> 02:19:05,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we need to do this.

1884
02:19:05,091 --> 02:19:05,572
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we do this?

1885
02:19:05,832 --> 02:19:08,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, in the studio, I don't know if you see on Justin TV right now.

1886
02:19:08,574 --> 02:19:12,837
[SPEAKER_02]: In the studio, there's a big blank, I'm sorry, there's a big blank space right here.

1887
02:19:13,217 --> 02:19:19,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking what we ought to do is we ought to start over here like a giant poster board and just a big list.

1888
02:19:19,761 --> 02:19:22,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that piss us off about GameStop.

1889
02:19:22,984 --> 02:19:27,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll just have a list and start adding to it as people call in and what have you.

1890
02:19:28,462 --> 02:19:29,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that!

1891
02:19:29,663 --> 02:19:30,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, what do you guys think in chat?

1892
02:19:30,883 --> 02:19:32,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a good idea, a bad idea?

1893
02:19:32,104 --> 02:19:32,724
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

1894
02:19:33,505 --> 02:19:38,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it should be like, put them on notice.

1895
02:19:39,347 --> 02:19:41,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting things on notice this week?

1896
02:19:42,149 --> 02:19:43,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it should be a whiteboard.

1897
02:19:44,250 --> 02:19:46,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to go to Target this week and get a whiteboard.

1898
02:19:46,591 --> 02:19:50,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're either going to do a GameStop list or a list of things on notice this week.

1899
02:19:51,474 --> 02:19:51,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

1900
02:19:52,374 --> 02:19:54,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, Rama, sorry, I know that's not what you wanted to talk about.

1901
02:19:54,875 --> 02:19:56,236
[SPEAKER_02]: What pissed you off about GameStop?

1902
02:19:57,338 --> 02:20:03,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, me and a roommate were planning on picking up Rock Band 2, and he loves the drums, so we're like, let's get the new drum kit.

1903
02:20:03,923 --> 02:20:10,928
[SPEAKER_12]: So I called over to make sure they had it in stock, then I asked them, are you buying back the old Rock Band 1 drum kit?

1904
02:20:10,948 --> 02:20:13,650
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, they should, and they're like, oh no, we're not buying them back.

1905
02:20:13,810 --> 02:20:14,690
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, how come?

1906
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:16,091
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just not, click.

1907
02:20:17,933 --> 02:20:19,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, what wonderful customer service.

1908
02:20:20,775 --> 02:20:21,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1909
02:20:22,156 --> 02:20:26,819
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're probably going to end up putting them on Craigslist and going to another place to buy the drum kit.

1910
02:20:27,512 --> 02:20:28,272
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, what the hell?

1911
02:20:28,893 --> 02:20:29,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

1912
02:20:29,633 --> 02:20:33,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember calling GameStop once and they were like, I'm too busy to answer your question.

1913
02:20:33,775 --> 02:20:34,715
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to come to the store.

1914
02:20:34,815 --> 02:20:40,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that they might actually be really busy, but there's just better ways to say it.

1915
02:20:40,718 --> 02:20:41,218
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1916
02:20:41,278 --> 02:20:45,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Like working in customer service myself, I'm kind of an ass when it comes to things like that.

1917
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:46,100
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1918
02:20:46,740 --> 02:20:49,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of like, you know, just, hey dude, just tell me, you know.

1919
02:20:50,462 --> 02:20:53,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I have a line of about five people right now.

1920
02:20:53,664 --> 02:20:58,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you possibly call back in a little bit or, you know, just, you know, could I take your number and call you back, you know, or something.

1921
02:20:59,567 --> 02:21:04,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, I wish they would do something like that, but I'm dreaming of a perfect world.

1922
02:21:04,069 --> 02:21:06,230
[SPEAKER_02]: You and me both.

1923
02:21:06,830 --> 02:21:08,531
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is going on in your gaming world?

1924
02:21:08,631 --> 02:21:08,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranma?

1925
02:21:10,312 --> 02:21:11,933
[SPEAKER_12]: I've just been playing a lot more of my 360 and...

1926
02:21:14,142 --> 02:21:18,065
[SPEAKER_12]: On a bit of a sad note to you, Rob, I'm not going to be able to do the game fly audition.

1927
02:21:18,725 --> 02:21:19,225
[SPEAKER_12]: The game what?

1928
02:21:20,186 --> 02:21:21,186
[SPEAKER_12]: The game fly audition.

1929
02:21:22,587 --> 02:21:23,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it didn't work out.

1930
02:21:23,748 --> 02:21:24,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

1931
02:21:24,248 --> 02:21:24,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't you do it?

1932
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:29,452
[SPEAKER_12]: More people got fired at my job, so guess who's covering shifts?

1933
02:21:30,692 --> 02:21:31,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, bummer.

1934
02:21:31,413 --> 02:21:31,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1935
02:21:31,793 --> 02:21:33,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know you can still send in a tape.

1936
02:21:33,434 --> 02:21:34,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you should give up.

1937
02:21:34,295 --> 02:21:35,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should send in a tape.

1938
02:21:36,536 --> 02:21:42,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I probably will end up doing it since I get a free moment because I had Joe Diaz camcorder here, so he might be able to pull that off.

1939
02:21:42,259 --> 02:21:42,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

1940
02:21:43,971 --> 02:21:44,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for saying the name.

1941
02:21:44,851 --> 02:21:45,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I'll remember it this time.

1942
02:21:47,412 --> 02:21:51,614
[SPEAKER_12]: She lowed when I told her you almost died trying to pronounce her name.

1943
02:21:52,374 --> 02:21:54,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying, I'm trying.

1944
02:21:54,195 --> 02:21:56,356
[SPEAKER_02]: How many different languages have I had to learn on this program?

1945
02:21:56,396 --> 02:21:58,016
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Japanese, now Italian.

1946
02:21:58,276 --> 02:22:00,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying.

1947
02:22:02,178 --> 02:22:04,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to share tonight with listeners, Ranma?

1948
02:22:06,343 --> 02:22:14,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Pax, 2009, OLL Army of New York in California, getting together, we're getting a suite, it's gonna happen.

1949
02:22:14,609 --> 02:22:16,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy fucking shit, yes please.

1950
02:22:16,891 --> 02:22:17,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes please.

1951
02:22:18,111 --> 02:22:18,792
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to say.

1952
02:22:20,393 --> 02:22:20,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1953
02:22:21,834 --> 02:22:22,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.

1954
02:22:22,254 --> 02:22:23,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, Ranma.

1955
02:22:23,675 --> 02:22:23,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma.

1956
02:22:23,876 --> 02:22:24,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranchan.

1957
02:22:25,377 --> 02:22:25,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart.

1958
02:22:25,637 --> 02:22:26,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesukchan.

1959
02:22:26,938 --> 02:22:27,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart.

1960
02:22:28,359 --> 02:22:29,460
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Heart's on Friday.

1961
02:22:30,362 --> 02:22:33,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, we're going to see Heart.

1962
02:22:34,124 --> 02:22:35,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to have a voice by then.

1963
02:22:36,105 --> 02:22:39,907
[SPEAKER_02]: You know DarkSakura loves her heart and I love my journey and they are touring together.

1964
02:22:39,927 --> 02:22:47,651
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be here on Friday and we are going to the concert and I'm so excited I can hardly contain myself.

1965
02:22:47,972 --> 02:22:50,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob is so excited he can hardly contain his bladder.

1966
02:22:51,093 --> 02:22:52,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to go to the bathroom right now.

1967
02:22:52,994 --> 02:22:54,895
[SPEAKER_12]: She's coming right with you because she loves hearts too.

1968
02:22:55,155 --> 02:22:56,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, she should totally teleport out here.

1969
02:22:57,317 --> 02:22:58,637
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have an extra ticket right now.

1970
02:22:58,657 --> 02:22:59,338
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to get rid of it.

1971
02:23:00,418 --> 02:23:00,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.

1972
02:23:01,319 --> 02:23:03,582
[SPEAKER_12]: She will find her way out in one way or another.

1973
02:23:03,863 --> 02:23:06,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if it means she has to pull a GTA and steal somebody's car and do it.

1974
02:23:07,568 --> 02:23:08,529
[SPEAKER_02]: She better start driving.

1975
02:23:08,549 --> 02:23:09,450
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got a long way to go.

1976
02:23:09,730 --> 02:23:10,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we gotta let you go.

1977
02:23:10,431 --> 02:23:11,633
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta see if any more calls come in.

1978
02:23:11,973 --> 02:23:12,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, buddy.

1979
02:23:12,574 --> 02:23:13,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, bye.

1980
02:23:13,696 --> 02:23:13,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1981
02:23:14,737 --> 02:23:17,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if anyone in Sacramento wants to come along...

1982
02:23:18,908 --> 02:23:19,449
[SPEAKER_02]: That we know.

1983
02:23:19,809 --> 02:23:22,071
[SPEAKER_02]: No strangers, please, because, you know, that might be weird.

1984
02:23:22,331 --> 02:23:23,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1985
02:23:23,372 --> 02:23:23,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1986
02:23:24,413 --> 02:23:26,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.

1987
02:23:26,695 --> 02:23:27,555
[SPEAKER_14]: It is Jason.

1988
02:23:27,715 --> 02:23:28,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Jason land.

1989
02:23:29,017 --> 02:23:30,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Orange Lounge Radio.

1990
02:23:30,298 --> 02:23:31,018
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

1991
02:23:31,839 --> 02:23:46,912
[SPEAKER_14]: So, speaking of heart, have you guys seen the article that Heart published, that had published in a magazine, I believe it was sometime this last week, about the Republican National Committee, specifically McCain, using Barracuda in one of his ads?

1992
02:23:47,791 --> 02:23:51,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I somehow had a bad feeling you were going to take this show back to politics.

1993
02:23:52,332 --> 02:23:54,573
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys mentioned it earlier.

1994
02:23:54,613 --> 02:23:55,653
[SPEAKER_14]: You were talking about the tour.

1995
02:23:55,673 --> 02:23:58,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to ask to make sure you guys have actually seen it because it was priceless.

1996
02:23:59,154 --> 02:23:59,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine, yes.

1997
02:23:59,874 --> 02:24:14,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those that aren't in the know, Hart got their feathers ruffled big time because one of the nicknames for Sarah Palin, who's the vice presidential nominee issued over the Republican Party, one of her nicknames in Alaska was Sarah Barracuda.

1998
02:24:14,817 --> 02:24:15,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see Russia from my house.

1999
02:24:16,458 --> 02:24:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Barracuda.

2000
02:24:17,839 --> 02:24:26,730
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually played Barracuda at the Republican National Convention, which is, as you know, a very popular Heart song, where you gamers probably know it from Guitar Hero 3, because it's in that game.

2001
02:24:27,571 --> 02:24:28,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And Heart was pissed.

2002
02:24:29,349 --> 02:24:31,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think that they're anything but Republican.

2003
02:24:31,932 --> 02:24:38,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, a lot of musicians get pissed off when that stuff is used because it makes it look like the musician endorses that candidate when they often don't.

2004
02:24:39,239 --> 02:24:39,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happens both ways.

2005
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:42,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember when Reagan used Born in the USA?

2006
02:24:42,763 --> 02:24:49,870
[SPEAKER_11]: And Springsteen threw a hissy over that, especially since the song was pretty much about nothing the Republican Party stands for.

2007
02:24:50,490 --> 02:25:06,533
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm sure it works both ways like you know there's a lot of artists like country artists and you know I think you've seen people on the convention that were Republican and they probably don't want their songs being used in Obama's campaign so it's just politics what a big mess

2008
02:25:07,850 --> 02:25:16,852
[SPEAKER_14]: I seem to remember when I was reading through the news that that's actually like the third time that artists have not been asked, not been directly compensated, and threw a hissy fit over it.

2009
02:25:17,252 --> 02:25:19,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, specifically for the public inside of the campaign.

2010
02:25:19,413 --> 02:25:22,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever's been getting the music clearances over there needs to be sacked.

2011
02:25:22,734 --> 02:25:25,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And then whoever hired that person also needs to be sacked.

2012
02:25:26,274 --> 02:25:28,715
[SPEAKER_14]: This is quite possibly going to be a very short answer.

2013
02:25:28,975 --> 02:25:31,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to step out because I really needed to get some food during the show.

2014
02:25:32,036 --> 02:25:37,317
[SPEAKER_14]: But have we covered the epic rock band crash and character transfer of Doom tonight?

2015
02:25:37,890 --> 02:25:38,910
[SPEAKER_14]: No, what's this about?

2016
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:39,290
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up?

2017
02:25:39,851 --> 02:25:47,673
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it was SSJ100Matt published a, put a link in chat like an hour and a half ago, pretty shortly after the show started.

2018
02:25:48,333 --> 02:26:02,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently for, it looks to be kind of skimmed, but for local games, characters, created Rock Band 2 characters would switch profiles that they were bound to, like they would be written out to the wrong gamer tag.

2019
02:26:03,277 --> 02:26:06,398
[SPEAKER_14]: So when one person goes back and plays, his character is completely gone.

2020
02:26:08,091 --> 02:26:29,009
[SPEAKER_14]: and apparently band progress is getting completely deleted apparently randomly perhaps when the console freezes up and just really really poorly there's about 11 pages on the rock band forums that talk about all these problems people have been having and quite unfortunately I kind of don't want to play the game until I hear of a patch

2021
02:26:29,716 --> 02:26:38,104
[SPEAKER_13]: No, what's funny is one thing I did do is I signed up on the Rock Band forums or whatever and you can link your gamertag to the actual community.

2022
02:26:38,444 --> 02:26:40,566
[SPEAKER_13]: It's only shown my Rock Band 1 stuff.

2023
02:26:42,027 --> 02:26:43,669
[SPEAKER_14]: I did that with the original Rock Band.

2024
02:26:43,709 --> 02:26:45,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't done that since I got 2 yet.

2025
02:26:45,475 --> 02:26:50,636
[SPEAKER_13]: But they don't have any of my Rock Band 2 stuff on there, even though I've been playing it online for like a while now.

2026
02:26:50,756 --> 02:26:56,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably takes a while to catch up, though, because there's probably like tons and tons and tons of people that are all playing this game online right now.

2027
02:26:56,638 --> 02:27:00,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably what's causing the crashes, too, is just like, you know, they're just probably overwhelmed.

2028
02:27:00,559 --> 02:27:03,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, on one hand, you ought to think they know how popular their game's going to be.

2029
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:07,981
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you know, you don't really know the strain until you put it out there.

2030
02:27:08,081 --> 02:27:08,521
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

2031
02:27:08,561 --> 02:27:12,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can test and test and test all you want, but you just don't know until it's out there.

2032
02:27:13,419 --> 02:27:20,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I'll restate that I only skimmed it, but I seem to remember that it was limited to local games and not quite online.

2033
02:27:21,126 --> 02:27:29,653
[SPEAKER_14]: In which case, the whole thing comes up of, do people really test it in such a narrow instance that they never had these problems when the game was being developed?

2034
02:27:29,753 --> 02:27:36,558
[SPEAKER_02]: It just really shocks me that the scores are just resetting, because I would think at least a backup copy saved on your local drive, if nothing else.

2035
02:27:37,119 --> 02:27:37,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I would imagine.

2036
02:27:38,040 --> 02:27:40,061
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one thing that bugs me more than anything is...

2037
02:27:40,982 --> 02:27:41,182
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't.

2038
02:27:41,203 --> 02:27:41,223
[SPEAKER_14]: I...

2039
02:27:56,581 --> 02:27:58,101
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a button code out there.

2040
02:27:58,141 --> 02:28:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to ruin it for everybody, but if you want to search the internet, there's a button code that you can do on the cheat menu that will unlock all the songs automatically.

2041
02:28:05,603 --> 02:28:06,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that temporary, though?

2042
02:28:07,003 --> 02:28:09,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Doesn't it not save your progress when you use any of those?

2043
02:28:09,704 --> 02:28:10,764
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they disabled it this time.

2044
02:28:11,164 --> 02:28:12,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's what it does.

2045
02:28:13,284 --> 02:28:21,606
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same code as in the first Rock Band game, and what it does on the cheat menu is it adds a toggle where you can toggle all songs off or all songs on.

2046
02:28:22,746 --> 02:28:28,267
[SPEAKER_13]: and if you turn them on then you can't save but you know it's more for like parties and that kind of thing.

2047
02:28:28,287 --> 02:28:33,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Right I was just going to say that sounds perfect for if I have a bunch of people over really want to play and I just throw it in quick play or something.

2048
02:28:33,989 --> 02:28:40,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah you can toggle it on and off once you've done it it'll save that little toggle on there and you can turn it on off or whatever.

2049
02:28:40,450 --> 02:28:43,051
[SPEAKER_13]: It's under the game modifier section under options.

2050
02:28:44,011 --> 02:28:47,554
[SPEAKER_14]: So first correction, it was Sephiroth1215, it wasn't SSJ100Matt.

2051
02:28:48,795 --> 02:28:58,502
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently, I don't know if the forum is just overloaded or if they shit-canned this thread or something, but I'm getting an error when I tried to browse to it again.

2052
02:28:58,962 --> 02:29:05,307
[SPEAKER_14]: I posted it in chat in case anybody else was curious, but something tells me nobody else is going to have any more luck than I am right now.

2053
02:29:06,309 --> 02:29:11,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I was trying to load the thread, too, and I had the same problem.

2054
02:29:11,795 --> 02:29:13,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, something's up.

2055
02:29:13,977 --> 02:29:14,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.

2056
02:29:14,457 --> 02:29:14,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2057
02:29:16,379 --> 02:29:20,103
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right, well, Jason, hey, we're going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the show, all right?

2058
02:29:20,724 --> 02:29:21,024
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.

2059
02:29:21,264 --> 02:29:22,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, my friend, though.

2060
02:29:22,105 --> 02:29:22,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, guys.

2061
02:29:23,166 --> 02:29:25,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, before you go, you're a drummer, right?

2062
02:29:25,989 --> 02:29:26,229
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2063
02:29:27,290 --> 02:29:28,071
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a drummer, right?

2064
02:29:29,418 --> 02:29:35,060
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily, yeah you need to join the band that Shane and I have starting because we need a drummer what are you guys doing?

2065
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:58,446
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a band called the Emergency Kittens I'll contact you with more info later sweet, sounds good alright, later yes, drummer recruited I mean, I could have gone to Bobby Blackwolf but he said that he's got like a million people that he's playing with I'd always play a game with Bobby Blackwolf too if he wants to look me up and any drummer, really alright, real quick, one more call real quick, one more call, who's this?

2066
02:29:59,994 --> 02:30:00,994
[SPEAKER_08]: This is James Patrick.

2067
02:30:01,074 --> 02:30:01,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, James Patrick.

2068
02:30:01,975 --> 02:30:02,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick question.

2069
02:30:02,455 --> 02:30:02,955
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2070
02:30:05,556 --> 02:30:09,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been listening to the whole show, but have you guys talked about Monster Hunter 3 Tri?

2071
02:30:10,118 --> 02:30:11,519
[SPEAKER_08]: The information that's come out about it?

2072
02:30:11,639 --> 02:30:12,099
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not.

2073
02:30:12,119 --> 02:30:13,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you share that information with our audience?

2074
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:18,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a bunch of screenshots and stuff from Famitsu has come out recently.

2075
02:30:18,982 --> 02:30:22,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It's confirmed for player online.

2076
02:30:23,704 --> 02:30:26,185
[SPEAKER_08]: The city will act as a lobby, apparently.

2077
02:30:27,265 --> 02:30:28,686
[SPEAKER_08]: It will appear at TGS.

2078
02:30:30,691 --> 02:30:36,194
[SPEAKER_08]: The engine has been completely rebuilt apparently for the first time since the first Monster Hunter game.

2079
02:30:38,995 --> 02:30:46,259
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, there's just a bunch of screenshots out there showing the game and it looks like Capcom is actually putting forth a lot of effort into this Wii game.

2080
02:30:47,260 --> 02:30:47,780
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty.

2081
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:50,021
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it that you love so much about Monster Hunter?

2082
02:30:51,262 --> 02:30:51,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played it.

2083
02:30:55,442 --> 02:30:59,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I know people who've played it and they're very enthusiastic about it.

2084
02:30:59,803 --> 02:31:03,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I'll try it with this game.

2085
02:31:03,265 --> 02:31:07,346
[SPEAKER_02]: 4Player Online.

2086
02:31:07,866 --> 02:31:11,887
[SPEAKER_08]: If they use the WeSpeak, I guess that might be the thing that gets me to get WeSpeak.

2087
02:31:17,803 --> 02:31:32,243
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got underwater battles as well, and you can go underwater and the monsters can go up above and underwater too apparently, and you can fight them in a different environment.

2088
02:31:32,764 --> 02:31:34,166
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like it might be interesting.

2089
02:31:34,844 --> 02:31:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh, sounds like it could be a pretty cool game.

2090
02:31:36,846 --> 02:31:46,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, James Patrick, thank you so much for the heads up, and we'll be counting down the days until this, and call us back and let us know how it plays out, because unfortunately I've got so many games I'm playing, I probably won't get around to this one.

2091
02:31:46,713 --> 02:31:48,034
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look to you for a review, okay?

2092
02:31:49,575 --> 02:31:50,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

2093
02:31:52,077 --> 02:31:52,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2094
02:31:53,157 --> 02:31:54,618
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2095
02:31:54,718 --> 02:32:01,719
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't get through tonight and still want to talk to us, hey, there's always the email bag or our chat room or our MySpace, our Facebook, our LiveJournal, our Twitter.

2096
02:32:01,959 --> 02:32:04,460
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a million different ways to find us and interact with us.

2097
02:32:04,600 --> 02:32:06,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know we love reaching out to you guys.

2098
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:07,880
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys help us make the show.

2099
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:09,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more last-minute stories, Loki?

2100
02:32:09,441 --> 02:32:09,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2101
02:32:09,761 --> 02:32:14,822
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, you would have heard about this early on Twitter because I posted it on Twitter before the news got out.

2102
02:32:15,302 --> 02:32:20,503
[SPEAKER_13]: But Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts RE Chains of Memories is coming

2103
02:32:20,943 --> 02:32:26,044
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, you posted it on your personal Twitter and not the OLR Twitter, and folks may not know you have your own personal.

2104
02:32:26,144 --> 02:32:27,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, whatever.

2105
02:32:27,885 --> 02:32:35,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, so it's the remake that, of course, came out with Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix is now coming to the U.S.

2106
02:32:35,607 --> 02:32:39,368
[SPEAKER_13]: to PlayStation 2 in December on the 2nd for $29.99.

2107
02:32:40,428 --> 02:32:41,649
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's not a bad deal.

2108
02:32:41,949 --> 02:32:46,730
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, they're adding some new stuff along with that, a brand new voice cast, new minigames.

2109
02:32:48,366 --> 02:32:50,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, 30 bucks, that's not bad at all.

2110
02:32:50,227 --> 02:32:53,267
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently Rockband.com is down right now.

2111
02:32:54,048 --> 02:32:56,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, some other stuff.

2112
02:32:57,068 --> 02:33:00,069
[SPEAKER_13]: And this wasn't on Cheryl at all, but I just remembered it.

2113
02:33:01,209 --> 02:33:09,992
[SPEAKER_13]: You remember last year how they did bundles with the Xbox 360 and you got free games for no additional cost?

2114
02:33:11,292 --> 02:33:16,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they're doing that again this holiday and I have what games and which consoles?

2115
02:33:18,413 --> 02:33:24,977
[SPEAKER_13]: The arcade system actually is getting, I don't know if this is that great, but Sega Superstars Tennis.

2116
02:33:26,378 --> 02:33:32,482
[SPEAKER_13]: And the elite and pro systems are both getting two games each.

2117
02:33:33,203 --> 02:33:37,325
[SPEAKER_13]: And those would be Kung Fu Panda and Lego Indiana Jones.

2118
02:33:38,686 --> 02:33:40,668
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's not bad for free for the holidays.

2119
02:33:41,208 --> 02:33:47,332
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess they're trying to target more of that family audience to fill that hole in their demographic there.

2120
02:33:48,590 --> 02:33:50,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, and let's see here.

2121
02:33:52,214 --> 02:34:01,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Lastly, I was going to mention that around the time when LittleBigPlanet comes out, they're going to be offering some free download content, one of which is a spacesuit.

2122
02:34:01,963 --> 02:34:04,025
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, you can be a spaceman as well.

2123
02:34:04,065 --> 02:34:05,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that only for pre-orders or something?

2124
02:34:05,627 --> 02:34:11,313
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's just they're going to offer it for a limited time during the first week when it comes out.

2125
02:34:11,813 --> 02:34:33,074
[SPEAKER_13]: and also you can get a rare t-shirt in it that says I was there for week one um those are both gonna be free to download and um the very last thing this kind of goes back to if you're listening live and heard our little funk remixes on there uh you too can check those out for free um they're all free to download off of the guys website um

2126
02:34:33,875 --> 02:34:38,098
[SPEAKER_13]: B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K

2127
02:35:01,394 --> 02:35:02,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Lyd Bjork.

2128
02:35:02,935 --> 02:35:03,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

2129
02:35:03,915 --> 02:35:05,836
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, those are all free to download.

2130
02:35:05,876 --> 02:35:14,779
[SPEAKER_13]: He has, uh, Nintensploitation, and then there's another album, uh, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo, which, uh, when I was playing one of those Aug files, it crashed my computer, so.

2131
02:35:15,260 --> 02:35:15,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't.

2132
02:35:16,180 --> 02:35:16,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh,

2133
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:17,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so I stopped playing those.

2134
02:35:18,041 --> 02:35:21,922
[SPEAKER_13]: But the first album that he has, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo, is a lot of Mega Man stuff.

2135
02:35:22,042 --> 02:35:32,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of the other games he remixes, Disney's DuckTales, there's a few tracks on there from that, and Gunsmoke, and of course, oh, there's one from Maniac Mansion.

2136
02:35:32,326 --> 02:35:32,886
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of cool.

2137
02:35:34,346 --> 02:35:35,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, very cool.

2138
02:35:35,727 --> 02:35:38,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them are good, some of them are alright.

2139
02:35:38,188 --> 02:35:44,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, there was one from Mario Brothers or something that's kind of weird.

2140
02:35:46,525 --> 02:35:48,188
[SPEAKER_13]: or Link's Got a Bop Gun.

2141
02:35:48,208 --> 02:35:49,289
[SPEAKER_13]: That was kind of a weird one.

2142
02:35:50,987 --> 02:35:52,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So, alright, that's it.

2143
02:35:52,568 --> 02:35:53,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, awesome.

2144
02:35:53,589 --> 02:35:58,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, DarkSakura, I'd ask if you have any last minute stories, but I know your voice is not doing too hot.

2145
02:35:58,772 --> 02:35:58,933
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2146
02:35:59,313 --> 02:36:01,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, I hope you feel better.

2147
02:36:02,335 --> 02:36:10,801
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, I hope the allergies die down and stop scratching at your throat, because that's very rude when you're a radio person to do that.

2148
02:36:10,821 --> 02:36:14,083
[SPEAKER_11]: It feels like an undead bird crawled into my throat and made a nest.

2149
02:36:14,744 --> 02:36:15,284
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you.

2150
02:36:15,324 --> 02:36:16,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, fuck.

2151
02:36:16,745 --> 02:36:20,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will ask for one more thing from you tonight, and that is your final thought.

2152
02:36:21,659 --> 02:36:22,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank God I don't like Heath bars.

2153
02:36:44,055 --> 02:36:48,078
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is frozen yogurt sounds really awesome right now.

2154
02:36:48,138 --> 02:36:48,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want.

2155
02:36:49,559 --> 02:36:50,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want frozen yogurt right now.

2156
02:36:51,380 --> 02:36:52,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thank you guys so much.

2157
02:36:52,641 --> 02:36:54,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the frozen yogurt place closes at 9 and it's now 9.05.

2158
02:36:56,824 --> 02:37:01,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for staying up and listening to us tonight and supporting independent radio.

2159
02:37:01,067 --> 02:37:04,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if you like what you heard, tell two friends about our show.

2160
02:37:04,729 --> 02:37:05,750
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we spread the word.

2161
02:37:05,790 --> 02:37:07,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all via word of mouth, you guys.

2162
02:37:08,131 --> 02:37:08,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.

2163
02:37:08,992 --> 02:37:10,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could leave us a five-star review on iTunes.

2164
02:37:11,434 --> 02:37:12,975
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a few people do that this week.

2165
02:37:13,015 --> 02:37:13,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.

2166
02:37:13,635 --> 02:37:16,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So much to the new five-star reviews we've had left on iTunes.

2167
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:17,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.

2168
02:37:17,681 --> 02:37:19,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheeseburger, message me with dongle.

2169
02:37:21,006 --> 02:37:23,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw Dongle show up on Twitter.

2170
02:37:24,469 --> 02:37:33,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, we had MozartFX left a nice five-star review, and Skylark91 left a nice one, WarriorBob a few days ago.

2171
02:37:33,675 --> 02:37:36,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan Shadow, who emailed us, left a nice five-star review not that long ago.

2172
02:37:36,697 --> 02:37:39,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys so much who have left the nice reviews for us on iTunes.

2173
02:37:39,559 --> 02:37:40,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Every little bit helps.

2174
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:42,101
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate it.

2175
02:37:42,121 --> 02:37:44,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we got any one-star reviews on there?

2176
02:37:44,923 --> 02:37:49,446
[SPEAKER_02]: If we did, I would not acknowledge them on this program because we don't want to encourage more people to do it.

2177
02:37:50,206 --> 02:37:52,187
[SPEAKER_02]: because actually one star reviews really hurt.

2178
02:37:52,487 --> 02:37:56,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, if you want to give the show a one star review, don't do that.

2179
02:37:56,188 --> 02:37:59,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Go give a show you like more a five star review.

2180
02:37:59,350 --> 02:38:00,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much more impactful.

2181
02:38:00,510 --> 02:38:04,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Go help a show you do like then because it's just kind of rude to leave a one star review in my opinion.

2182
02:38:05,252 --> 02:38:07,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's it.

2183
02:38:07,233 --> 02:38:07,773
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of here.

2184
02:38:07,893 --> 02:38:08,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night everybody.

2185
02:38:08,653 --> 02:38:13,975
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next week with episode 296 of Orange Lounge Radio as we inch closer to that big 300 mark.

2186
02:38:14,015 --> 02:38:14,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes!

2187
02:38:15,996 --> 02:38:18,757
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2188
02:38:19,298 --> 02:38:22,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2189
02:38:22,959 --> 02:38:31,603
[SPEAKER_06]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2190
02:38:32,104 --> 02:38:43,709
[SPEAKER_06]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2191
02:38:44,269 --> 02:38:45,110
[SPEAKER_06]: See you next week!
