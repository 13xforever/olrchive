00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, September 21st, 2008

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Warcraft's expansion finally gets a release date

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Could Metal Slug get re-released in high definition?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And Animal Crossing undergoes a strange name change overseas

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are that podcast on the internet

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And the gamer lifestyle

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We always tape live on Sunday nights

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
At about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
On AllGames.com

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Although we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The show before us, The Bobby Black Wolf Show

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ran over just a smidge

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But that's kind of our fault

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Because we're always on at the end of his show

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And then we had a little teeny weeny snafu

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Transitioning between shows

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So we're a little bit late start tonight

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But we are live and running

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And my name is Rob Roberts

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I join you here every week on the program

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And also join you every week

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Say hello to the one and only

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Jamie Summers

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hi

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How are you doing, Jamie Summers?

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I have no voice

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Did you eat a frog?

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No, I didn't

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What happened?

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When it got a little bit cooler here

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The wind picked up and blew all of the pollen around

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And well, I'm very prone to sinus infections

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And I'm trying to fight off one

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You know what you need?

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A SARS mask

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You know what I need?

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What?

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Power thirst

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's made from lightning

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Awesome

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Alright, so also say hello to the one and only

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Techmaster Loki

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Knock it off

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sorry, Loki, not you

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's up, Loki?

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Not much

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I figured out why that song cut off pre-show

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, hold on

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We gotta explain now

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
For the people listening on the podcast

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Before we go live

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We always like play a song

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
To kind of transition from the previous show

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
To our show

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And tonight was

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What is this?

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A Funk to the Past

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Was the song that we played

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, Ninten-sploitation

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Uh-huh

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Nintendo-sploitation

70
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's by

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Lime Mutterplucken B

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is the name of the guy that does it

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Unique

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It all

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They all flow together each song

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So that's why part of the song is on another track

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Gotcha, because I was like

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why is that song cut off?

79
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's weird, okay

80
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But it's one of those CDs that transitions

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
From song to song

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I get it

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Alrighty

84
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, if you would like to join us

85
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And give your input on the show

86
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What's going on

87
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can always join our chat room

88
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Or if you only have an IRC client or whatever

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You can always point yourself to the Game Surge Network

91
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
At gamesurge.net

92
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And our chat room is Channel Orange Lounge

93
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's not just a clever name

94
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So we are going to get into tonight's show

95
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We always kick it off with a little bit of insight

96
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
On our gaming weeks and the games we've been playing

97
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

98
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Um

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I played Ragnarok

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ragnarok

101
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And um

102
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, I played something else

103
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Here's my occasional question on

104
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Where's Ragnarok 2?

105
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Whatever happened to Ragnarok 2?

106
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's in beta still

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Still?

108
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hasn't it been beta for like a year and a half?

109
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Usually it's been forever

110
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Do you know how long the first Ragnarok was in beta?

111
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
A long, long time?

112
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I played the beta for about three years

113
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Geez

114
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Wow

115
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Alright

116
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So, no, no, not three

117
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It was about

118
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, it was about two years that I played the beta

119
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because I started on the

120
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The first closed beta

121
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I think

122
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Or before

123
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No?

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, the first closed beta

125
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So a long time

126
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah

127
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, wow, geez

128
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry you haven't tried to get in on that beta

129
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's just something about you have to have a Korean

130
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Equivalent of a social security number to get in

131
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I also looked more into it

132
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And the only thing that I'm really interested in is the soundtrack

133
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's done by Yoko Kanno

134
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh nice

135
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, I mean

136
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
As soon as I can find a reliable way to give it a go

137
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I might try, but for right now

138
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There's emulated ways

139
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Alright, fair enough

140
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, if that's it for your gaming week

141
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then, Loki, how was your gaming week?

142
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Um, it was alright

143
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I played

144
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Not a whole lot this week

145
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Mainly

146
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I played a lot of things

147
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Grand Theft Auto IV, of course

148
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Trying to keep on my winning streak

149
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But there was a day that I let it get away from me

150
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
For a game or so

151
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But it's back now

152
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So I'm still on my winning streak

153
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And then, um

154
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I played

155
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Some more Mercenaries 2

156
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I swear

157
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The more I play that game

158
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The more broken it gets

159
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But it's kind of entertaining

160
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Just to see how bad

161
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The glitching will get

162
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And so I'm about

163
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
To get my way through it now

164
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then

165
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I also played

166
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Pure, which is pretty fun

167
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's an ATV off-road racing game

168
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Kind of a little similar

169
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
To Excite Truck, sort of

170
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Um

171
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Controls aren't exactly as tight as Excite Truck

172
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I mean, it's a little bit more realistic

173
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But, um

174
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You know, a lot of flying through the air

175
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And doing tricks and stuff like that

176
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And lots of nitrous, so it's fun

177
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But, um

178
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, that's pretty much it so far

179
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Alright, well

180
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
My gaming week, I actually played something new

181
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This week, I went out and got a copy

182
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Of Warhammer Online

183
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I decided I was gonna take the plunge and go ahead and

184
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Start playing another MMO

185
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So I went and grabbed myself a copy of Warhammer Online

186
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And, um

187
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know, MMOs are really hard to evaluate

188
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You know, it takes a long time because there's so

189
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Much depth to them

190
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That they can take a long time to evaluate

191
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I'm not sure what my full opinion of Warhammer Online is

192
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm still playing it, so that must be a good sign, right?

193
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I had a friend of mine quit after playing it for

194
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
About ten minutes

195
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Saying it was garbage

196
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So, I mean, I guess I was into it long enough

197
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
To keep going past that

198
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So, you know

199
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Here's the thing, I'll start with what I don't like

200
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
About the game

201
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I actually don't care for the graphics

202
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Even though some of the textures are very pretty

203
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And some of the shadow is very cool

204
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
For some reason, Warhammer

205
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Feels really clunky to me

206
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Really clunky

207
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There seems to be delay in some of the things I do

208
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And, you know, you could blame my computer's

209
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Performance, but seeing as I just got a new

210
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Quad-core 6GB RAM computer

211
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't think it's necessarily the computer's

212
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Specs that are slowing it down

213
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You know, it's just

214
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The interface feels a little clunky to me

215
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's not so bad that the game

216
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Really suffers because I still

217
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Will play it and everything

218
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But it's a little bit clunky to me

219
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And, I don't know, sometimes I find

220
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The interface to be messy, but it's highly

221
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Highly customizable, which is cool

222
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And they really encourage people to customize this, that's cool

223
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Alright, so, some of the things I do like about the game now

224
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I do like kind of the way

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That the game seems to be kind of

226
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Split off into these three

227
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Different areas, you have your PVE

228
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Stuff, which feels pretty much

229
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Like Warcraft, you know, and it's

230
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Go to

231
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Guy with exclamation point overhead

232
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Or in this case, a little book with

233
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A green book, get quest

234
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Go do quest, turn in quest

235
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You know, it's very, very similar to

236
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Kind of the

237
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Warcraft, but what I thought was

238
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Kind of cool was now the different branches

239
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That the game would go down, and that was something

240
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Called Realm vs Realm, which is

241
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Similar, I guess you could say, to PvP

242
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Like, for instance, one of the

243
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Realm vs Realm things I got into was

244
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This thing where it's

245
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
For those that have played Warcraft, it's very

246
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Similar to Arathi Basin

247
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But you only have two nodes, and for those that are playing

248
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Warhammer, I'm describing Kain's Embrace

249
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think that's how you say it

250
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But what's kind of cool about it, what I really liked

251
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is that, okay, so you have, you know, the order

252
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And you have chaos, and you're trying to capture

253
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Both the nodes, and when one

254
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Team captures both nodes

255
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What's really cool is that it sets off this

256
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Giant, like, alarm, like you hear

257
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
A rrrrrrrrr sound, and then

258
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
After ten seconds, giant

259
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Explosions happen at both

260
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The nodes to kind of reset the board

261
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So, like, you'll see one team captures the nodes

262
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And then you'll hear the big horn

263
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And then you'll see everybody start running away

264
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because they want to get out of the explosion

265
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because if you get into the explosion, you instantly die

266
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And I actually had a lot of fun with it

267
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It was cracking me up, and I thought it was actually

268
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Really well done, so I can

269
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Tell already that the PvP

270
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In this game is pretty well thought out

271
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And done really well, and I

272
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Really like the fact that the game kind of

273
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Gives you buffs, so that, like, let's say

274
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This particular

275
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
RVR experience

276
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Is a one versus ten

277
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They call it ranks in Warhammer, but you notice

278
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Levels, let's say it's a level one

279
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Through ten, you know, RVR

280
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Instance, everybody gets bumped up

281
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
To rank eight, so that way

282
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You know, even if you're kind of lower

283
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You get the stats of a rank eight character

284
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So that way the playing field seems a little

285
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
More level, it seems like they've really

286
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Kind of tested this out and really

287
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Kind of tweaked the PvP in this

288
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I think if you're, like, a PvP player mostly

289
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're gonna be drawn to

290
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Warhammer, I think, a lot more

291
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Than WoW, and Warhammer does

292
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Have some PvE elements in it

293
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And the other thing, kind of the other road that Warhammer

294
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Goes down that I thought was kind of cool was the idea

295
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Of public quests, which is

296
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Kind of neat, like, you can go into an area

297
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And there might be an event going on, and again

298
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
To compare this to Warcraft, because that's what, you know

299
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I just do that because that's what most you MMO players

300
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Know, I would say, like, imagine

301
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You could just walk into a 25 man

302
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Raid and walk out as you please

303
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's kind of what a public quest is

304
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You'll go into an area and there might be an event

305
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Going on, like an early event that I played

306
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Was one where you kill 30

307
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Guards, then you protect 30 guards

308
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Then you have to kill a giant dragon

309
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And his Beastmaster, and like that

310
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Whole event kind of goes on, it takes about 15

311
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Minutes to complete, and you can run in and play

312
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
As much or as little as you want

313
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But the more you participate in it, the better

314
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Your role is going to be for the loot at the end

315
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then as you play it, your reputation

316
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Kind of goes up slowly

317
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Does Beastmaster have a pair of ferrets?

318
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No, he does not have a pair of ferrets

319
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He's the Beastmaster over, like, a dragon

320
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There might be a ferret Beastmaster later in the game

321
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know, but uh...

322
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Are they called Kodo and Podo?

323
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No. But yeah, I thought that was kind of neat

324
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That you could slowly gain the

325
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You know, kind of the experience that way

326
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So there's many different ways to

327
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Experience in the game and different types

328
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Of, you know, you have your

329
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Renown is one

330
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And then your experience

331
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You meet the different things to accomplish

332
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But, like, I haven't really gotten a chance

333
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
To tackle the crafting

334
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So I feel like there's still a lot more of this game

335
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
For me to explore

336
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And the MMO is early

337
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So, you know, while I might be criticizing

338
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The graphical interface and these sorts of things

339
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Early on, there's gonna be

340
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Patches that will probably fix a lot of the stuff

341
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That bugs us. I mean, let's face it

342
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Pretty much any MMO has a lot of issues

343
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
When it first launches. So that's another reason

344
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why I'm like, hmm, I can't really

345
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Review this game in full yet

346
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because it still has a long way to grow

347
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And develop. But I will say this

348
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If you're a PvPer

349
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You really like the player versus player stuff

350
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I think you're really gonna enjoy Warhammer

351
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Even if you're more of a PvE type person

352
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There's something worth

353
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Checking out here for you. Like, I'm usually not a big

354
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
PvPer, but I thought it was set up enough where

355
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't feel like

356
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I was wasting my time

357
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If that makes sense. Like, I was having a good time

358
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And I was enjoying the game. And that's really what it comes down to

359
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So I do recommend

360
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If you like MMOs, check out Warhammer

361
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Online. At least do your research

362
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Check into it. See if it's something you like

363
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Sadly there's no trial for it, really

364
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And I think that's one thing they're severely lacking

365
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And they need to get up and running in the next 60 days

366
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Is get a trial for the people who really

367
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Want to check out what this game's all about

368
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Because they can get away with it for right now

369
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Because the game's got a lot of hype and they're gonna have a lot of initial user base

370
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But I really think if they want to

371
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Really try to sway people

372
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They're gonna need to have a trial similar to

373
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What Warcraft has where you can experience the first

374
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
20 levels or so. I think that's what

375
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Warhammer badly needs. Would you guys check out

376
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Warhammer if they had something like that?

377
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Where you didn't have to drop the dollars to check it out? No? Why?

378
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not at all interested in Warhammer

379
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're not really a big, big MMO player

380
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I mean, you play Ragnarok, but you haven't enjoyed

381
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
A lot of the other MMOs you've played. You didn't enjoy

382
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Warcraft, you didn't. That's different.

383
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's a space one. But I actually

384
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I liked World of Warcraft until

385
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It turned out that it just wasn't worth my time

386
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Loki?

387
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, I don't play MMOs right now

388
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And even when

389
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
My wife joins Warcraft, I may not

390
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Do that. Alright, fair enough.

391
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Although when APB comes around

392
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We'll talk again

393
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Alright, well that's it for my gaming week, otherwise

394
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Just pretty much Rock Band 2 and games you've heard me

395
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Talk about before. So

396
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight

397
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And tonight for housekeeping, Loki wants to

398
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Talk about olrpsp.com

399
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, I was just gonna say that I have a thread

400
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Up in our forum right now

401
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Basically

402
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Allowing you guys to

403
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Submit banners

404
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Because if you notice on the

405
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Olrpsp all games radio player

406
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That there's a little banner

407
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That keeps repeating, and you'll probably have noticed

408
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That there's only three of them. One including

409
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
A banner for the PAX

410
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Coverage, which is way old now.

411
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So we need more banners

412
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And it's real easy

413
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Pretty much you can make a banner for

414
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You know, either one of the shows

415
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
On the network, one of the

416
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Inside jokes, something

417
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You know, funny like one of the PSAs

418
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Just anything. Just pretty much

419
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Anything that's kind of show related

420
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Or network related

421
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Or indie production related

422
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah, and basically

423
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Just 296 pixels

424
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
By 32, and

425
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Why is it such a weird ass banner size?

426
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's just the size I made it

427
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And there you go

428
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And all the details are on our forums

429
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And you can post your

430
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Images there

431
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Or email them to me

432
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And if they're decent

433
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Then we'll throw them up there

434
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And you can see the awesome

435
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Olrpsp.com, you can see this in action

436
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
On that great all games radio

437
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Tuner on the PSP

438
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Awesome

439
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Speaking of please for stuff

440
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You know, we've been having to recycle a lot of the

441
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Audio bumpers we used during our free breaks

442
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
In the middle of the show

443
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We haven't done any new stuff lately

444
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So please if you have an independent show you want to plug

445
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You host your own podcast or whatever

446
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Please send me commercials

447
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Fake PSAs, whatever you want to send

448
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's not for profit

449
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We're looking for more stuff, we really need some stuff

450
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't think you're going to hear a lot in tonight's free break

451
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Because I don't want to recycle the same old crap over and over again

452
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Sadly I didn't have time to create anything new today

453
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So we really rely on you guys

454
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
For some of the extra stuff

455
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Just send me an email or post on the forums

456
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There's all that cool stuff on there

457
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Rhetortainment is in chat

458
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Reading some comments from chat, he says

459
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I have the latest version of the PSP hardware

460
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I tried to download the all games player on

461
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
OLRPSP.com and it didn't work

462
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Any thoughts on what might be going on?

463
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I have no idea

464
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It should work, you just put it in this

465
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's probably the directory that you have it in

466
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You probably set it in the wrong directory

467
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Try downloading the official radio players

468
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Off of Sony's website

469
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If those work for you

470
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Then I don't know

471
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's probably the same directory as those

472
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But you test on the latest

473
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
PSP firmwares as they're released right?

474
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No

475
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Then again it shouldn't matter

476
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
They don't remove anything

477
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
From the PSP firmwares

478
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
To be honest I don't have any legitimate

479
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Firmwares

480
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It doesn't matter because they're the exact

481
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Same thing plus other added bonuses

482
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want to read this comment

483
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
From earlier because I'm not sure

484
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If it's on the right track or not

485
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Jamie also has bad memories

486
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Involving things like Warhammer right?

487
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Is that true or not?

488
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The Warhammer with the little models

489
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah

490
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What happened?

491
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I had an ex who would play Warhammer to the exclusion of all else

492
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yikes

493
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And I would have to sit and paint his models

494
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Do you think that he's gotten

495
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Sucked into this thing beyond belief at this point?

496
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Dude I don't know

497
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is 12 years ago in Alabama

498
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It was worth asking

499
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't care what happened

500
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Was it Warhammer or Warhammer 40,000?

501
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It was Warhammer 40k

502
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Keep in mind

503
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
My review comes from somebody who has never

504
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Touched a Warhammer model

505
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Or done any of that stuff

506
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I did get vengeance on him once

507
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How so?

508
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He had some sort of big figure that was

509
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This hulking creature

510
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And I painted it hot pink

511
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Nice

512
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That was pretty cool

513
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well also pretty cool

514
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Some video game news!

515
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Loki, start us off tonight would you?

516
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Alright

517
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
This time

518
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think we may have talked about this a little bit before

519
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But Rock Revolution

520
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
As if you needed more reasons

521
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Why it's not gonna be that great

522
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Well Konami says that they're not actually gonna put out

523
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Any guitars for it

524
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So you're gonna need to find your own guitars

525
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Whether that be a Guitar Hero guitar

526
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
A rock band guitar

527
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Or you're just gonna need another guitar

528
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Cause if you don't own any music game

529
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And for some reason you decide this is the one you

530
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Want to start off with

531
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Well all you're gonna be able to get is just the drums

532
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And that's it. No guitars for you

533
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You know what do you think of this? Because at first

534
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I was kinda like laughing to myself

535
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Going, well geez this just kinda goes to show

536
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
About this game

537
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Then as I was thinking about it I was like

538
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But at the same time I really don't need another freaking

539
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Guitar in my house

540
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So in a way I'm thankful

541
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Not necessarily I mean they should

542
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They have the option of buying the game by itself

543
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Or the bundle

544
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But the thing is they're just not gonna make a guitar

545
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Whatsoever and that's fine if they don't want to do it

546
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But I've had you know Konami reps

547
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Before tell me oh we're not in the

548
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We're not in the peripheral business

549
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But yet you have peripherals bundled with

550
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Your DDR bundles so

551
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You're a liar

552
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Basically

553
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But yeah they're not trying to be in the peripheral business

554
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yet they're making a game with peripherals

555
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So they're kind of

556
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well plus the fact that

557
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's not like Konami's never made a guitar controller

558
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Before they just didn't do it

559
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Here it's probably they just don't want to make another

560
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
One they probably have reasons

561
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And it's maybe something to do with

562
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You know the fact that they've licensed out there

563
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Designed for guitars

564
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
To other companies or something maybe there's something

565
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Legal

566
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That we don't see

567
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yet I mean that's part of the lawsuit

568
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Or something that's why they didn't do it

569
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And that's why they only did drum controller

570
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Maybe I'm thinking

571
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That's got to be the reason because if you notice the drum

572
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Controllers that they have out there

573
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They're not exactly rip offs

574
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Of the original

575
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Drum mania controller

576
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Except for Konami's which is obviously

577
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It looks like kind of a rip off of the original

578
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Drum mania controller but they can do that since it's theirs

579
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And it sucked for the record

580
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah so

581
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's my thing is that maybe they

582
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
These people are paying to license

583
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You know these guitars or something

584
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I don't know

585
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Non compete thing or something I don't know

586
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You know Bobby Blackwolf

587
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Is in our chat right now and he obviously does the show

588
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Before us here on All Games he says

589
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I find it funny this is news when Konami has always

590
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Said this Konami told me at E3 that they are

591
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Only making a drum peripheral and really

592
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's one less plastic instrument you have to buy

593
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And yeah I want to say Loki saw something

594
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
In the retail world that indicated this is going to be

595
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
True a while ago too but it's kind of

596
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Interesting because you see the trailers for Rock Revolution

597
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Hitting this week and there's really no

598
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Hint at this whole thing

599
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And what about the fact that people are going to be

600
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Buying this game maybe expecting that there's

601
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Going to be a guitar with it because that's what you see

602
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
In the other bundles

603
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Well it will just have to be very clear on the box

604
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That it's not going to happen

605
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You and I both know it will be in tiny tiny print

606
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Somewhere, guitar not included

607
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well I think it's also you know the guitar

608
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Not included I don't even remember if they have

609
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Vocals in this as well I think

610
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No they don't have

611
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Vocals in it before they were going to

612
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But they accidentally

613
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So it's just a guitar and drums

614
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And

615
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't know I don't think it's a big deal because

616
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Shit you can buy used guitars like used

617
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Guitar Hero 2 guitars for like 12 bucks

618
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So

619
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Doesn't really matter but

620
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't know

621
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Whatever do what they want to do the game is going to suck anyways

622
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Are you sure?

623
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And again

624
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Having not played it what's your basis for this?

625
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
My basis for it is it looks cheap

626
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
All the videos I've seen from it look cheap

627
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
All the gameplay from it I've seen looks very cheap

628
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It just looks like a cheap knock off

629
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And that's sad because you know

630
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
They were the ones that pioneered this

631
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But it's just a cheap knock off

632
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What their problem was is they

633
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Did it right to start with in Japan

634
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But they didn't realize that their American

635
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
User base would be interested in the same stuff too

636
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So it was they started way

637
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Too late

638
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And I'll quote Bobby that there is

639
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
One of the icons for the drum

640
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Is actually a dark grey

641
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Come on

642
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's retarded what were you thinking

643
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You know and I've said this on the show before

644
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I don't know if I want to continue to beat a dead horse

645
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But you know in a way

646
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If Konami is going to assume

647
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You know what happens about assuming

648
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That this stuff is not going to

649
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Take off in America you know then they have

650
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No one to blame but themselves for what's happening now

651
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I mean and this

652
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Sounds all conspiracy theory

653
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Like but I really think

654
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That they're making this so that it doesn't

655
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Do well so that they can sue

656
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Them so they have reason

657
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
To say hey look your game is causing

658
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Our game not to sell

659
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But

660
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't think that that

661
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Would fly in court and they know it

662
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They'd have to know better

663
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Alright well let's see what you guys

664
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The listeners thought because OLR is the show

665
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
How long did they register any

666
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Licenses for Guitar Freak

667
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
For Guitar Freak Surger Mania

668
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They did Guitar Revolution a while back

669
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Well they also had an arcade release of Guitar Freaks here

670
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So you know that's years old

671
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't know if that would count for a console

672
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Well now that I think of it Guitar Revolution and Drum Revolution

673
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh Rock Revolution here we go

674
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Alright anyhow

675
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Let's go to the pre-OLR

676
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Twitter to see what you guys

677
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Out there thought and we asked on our Twitter

678
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Our username on Twitter if you're a Twitter user you should

679
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Add us it's just simply OLR

680
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Before every show we ask questions

681
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This week we asked are you getting Rock Revolution

682
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Why or why not

683
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
DGRamaS said possibly problem is

684
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Real estate space but if the game works with

685
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Guitar Hero Rock Band Controllers then yes

686
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And I think it's been pretty well known now that

687
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yes it will work with both

688
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So that's a yes

689
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Picaruno says hell no because that's the answer I gave

690
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Last time I guess during the show we must

691
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Ask this before once

692
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The SEG said no I enjoy the

693
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Careful selection harmonics practices

694
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
In their set list they are game designers

695
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Of music so kind of going back to the set list

696
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
K Rose

697
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Says I won't buy it

698
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I only like Konami games for the Japanese music

699
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If it's localized I'll get a better

700
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Rhythm band game like Rock Band

701
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Interesting perspective that you know they didn't

702
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Bring over anything from Japan so

703
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
There are folks that like that although I gotta say

704
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Though you're kind of a niche

705
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Market in that case you know

706
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I think it would be nice if somebody would

707
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Release a game that has some of the US stuff

708
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And that but you're never

709
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Going to see a game released over here

710
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's kind of retarded about this too

711
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The game only version of this is coming out in early

712
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
October the

713
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Actual instruments the drums

714
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And those bundles aren't coming until like

715
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Mid November

716
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Well Rock Band 2 is the same way

717
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well they're just doing that now because they have the

718
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Exclusive for it but it's still

719
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Stupid because if you want to try their

720
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Unique drums or whatever how many people are going to

721
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Buy this game and just go eh

722
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Whatever you know I'm not going to buy the drums

723
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Now they're stuck with a bunch of drums

724
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Alright going back to the Twitter question

725
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Are you going to buy Rock Revolution

726
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
GS68 says I'm too ghetto to bother shelling

727
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Out the moneys for it. Act Def says no

728
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Because Konami failed to do this years ago and they

729
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Should have and they're not even offering something

730
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
At the level of Rock Band Guitar Hero

731
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Gold Anthro says no because if I was going to spend

732
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The money for a game like that I'd buy Guitar Hero or

733
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Rock Band. Marin Marvel says

734
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
No it's too little too late for Konami to try to

735
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Jump back into the music game business in the US

736
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
They've already failed hardcore

737
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Joosten says all covers in an

738
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Archaic interface? No thank you

739
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Plus the drums look like ass. Konami

740
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Missed the boat years ago

741
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I can never say this name

742
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Giove Dea

743
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Giove Dea

744
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I think

745
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I got lessons on how to pronounce it last week but I

746
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Already forgot. I think it's Giove Dea

747
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
As DJ Rama S said

748
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Only if it works with the stuff I already have

749
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Javier Altman says

750
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Because we already have enough plastic

751
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Instrument stuff. Konami is

752
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Too late for their own good. The last Bossa

753
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
De Sanna has been played

754
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Sponge Twang says I will wait out

755
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Most likely into next year after

756
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The dust has settled. I need to figure which

757
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Plastic instruments work with which games

758
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
DJ Tyrant says depends on how good the

759
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Execution is since it's compatible

760
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
With Rock Band 2 Guitar Hero gear

761
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I might pick it up but they are very late to the party

762
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And lastly Chad28 says

763
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
No because they are mostly songs

764
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That have already been used in other Guitar Hero

765
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Rock Band games and no Master Tracks

766
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
There you have it

767
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

768
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And um

769
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah

770
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So alright well we'll see what happens

771
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I mean it's really hard to make an ultimate

772
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Decision until the game actually comes out

773
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I would just if you're unsure about it

774
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Just wait cause

775
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You know in the past there have been other games that haven't

776
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Performed very well and the price drops

777
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Come very quickly so

778
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Alright we'll see what happens

779
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Alright well let's move on talking about Guitar Hero

780
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Since we're kind of on music game news right now

781
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Very interesting story being teased this week is that

782
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It was the CEO of Publishing

783
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
For Activision, Mike Griffith

784
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
He has actually kind of come out and said

785
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
According to Shaq News that

786
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
They might be looking at a subscription

787
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Model for Guitar Hero

788
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So where as you know Rock Band and Guitar Hero

789
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
To date function with their download content

790
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Kind of like iTunes, imagine a system that was

791
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
More like Napster where it's more

792
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Subscription based

793
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Apparently 20 million individual

794
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Songs have already been downloaded for Guitar Hero

795
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Which is pretty impressive when you consider that

796
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
There's not nearly as much

797
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
As there is for Rock Band, I mean there's some good stuff

798
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And not nearly as much

799
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Just it could be interesting

800
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
If especially if the timetable is

801
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Stepped up for the releases

802
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What this annual subscription model could do

803
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What do you guys think, is the subscription model a good idea

804
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Bad idea? I don't think it's a good idea

805
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Why is that? Because you don't know what's coming out

806
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I mean that's

807
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Kind of stupid, who knows what they're going to put out

808
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
What frequency it's going to be coming out as

809
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I mean there might be a lot of stuff that you're not

810
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Really interested in

811
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I would say you'd have

812
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I think the better deal is the way that Rock Band's doing it

813
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Where you have a bundle of songs

814
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That you can pay for

815
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And if you want all of them you get it like a buck cheaper

816
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Or something like that

817
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Or you know you can buy individual songs

818
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because if you pay like say 60 bucks a year or whatever

819
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
For the subscription model or whatever

820
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What if it's not worth it to you

821
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Because all these songs coming out

822
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And you have them and you're just like eh

823
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What do you think, Dark Sakura?

824
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What if for a subscription model

825
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
If they had it like

826
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Okay you know how it used to be like if you did like

827
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
BMG music or something

828
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
How you would

829
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
They had their featured CD

830
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And then you could refuse it if you want to

831
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And picked what you wanted to order

832
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What if they did something to that effect

833
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Where they say this is our exclusive featured

834
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Track, you can only get it this way

835
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
However if you don't want it

836
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Then choose something else

837
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And then also the other thing comes too

838
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's nice that they want to do this

839
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But is this actual model built into

840
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Xbox Live, Marketplace

841
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Or Playstation Network

842
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Now we know Playstation Network can do it

843
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Because they obviously have their core subscription model

844
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And you can pay for stuff that way

845
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Why not? There's two MMOs on Xbox 360

846
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That have subscription models

847
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Fantasy Star Universe and Final Fantasy XI

848
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah but those are done through their own individual servers

849
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But you still pay for it on Xbox Live

850
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That's true, in the case of the

851
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Fantasy Star Universe you actually pay for that on

852
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Xbox Live, so it's got to

853
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Be there

854
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
They actually have you input all of your billing information

855
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Right before you can start

856
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
VXJ6V comes up with an interesting point in chat

857
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Loki you don't know what music comes out in the real world

858
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Either until it's about to or does

859
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
This is fundamentally nothing different from

860
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Actual music subscription services

861
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But at the same time I mean to kind of

862
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But at the same time though it's not necessarily

863
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Just

864
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I mean what are they going to do? You have to pay

865
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
To this service to get

866
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Access to all the download content

867
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Or you're just going to get access to the new stuff

868
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Like say if I'm on Rhapsody or

869
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You know Napster or whatever

870
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Napster's got to have, I mean I'm just pulling

871
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
This number out of my butt, but Napster's got to have

872
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Hundreds of thousands of songs on it

873
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Exactly, that's a little different thing

874
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Guitar Hero has a bucket full

875
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Maybe, not a room full

876
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You know what I mean? Exactly

877
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's totally different

878
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Unless they're going to start pumping out

879
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
20 tracks a week

880
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Or something like that, then that's different

881
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But I don't think they are

882
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I notice a lot of people are kind of turning their noses

883
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Up as subscription models, but I mean

884
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That's pretty much how all MMOs work

885
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And also the other thing you have to look at too

886
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Are people really going to start

887
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Wanting all this

888
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Licensed music

889
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Which is good, but at the same time

890
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
With Guitar Hero World Tour now you're going to have

891
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
All this independently made music

892
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
All the stuff through the

893
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Song creator or whatever

894
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That you can download for free

895
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So

896
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
What I'm thinking might work

897
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Is sort of, I'm going back to what I was saying before

898
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
About having the exclusive

899
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Subscription only stuff

900
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
If they have like

901
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Certain things that are available only

902
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Through subscription and they have their regular

903
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Bundle packs that everybody has access to

904
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But there's only certain

905
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Really good stuff available

906
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
To people who are in the fan club

907
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
What about like a

908
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Just kind of really going off wild here

909
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
What about like a Guitar Hero magazine or something

910
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Or a tie in with a rock magazine

911
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Or something that would come with a CD with bonus tracks

912
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because I'm thinking rock bands kind of done that

913
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Like the Xbox

914
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
What, official Xbox magazine had like three bonus

915
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Songs on it at once so you could only get there

916
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Well I think they came out for download eventually

917
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But a long time later

918
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And there was the deal about buying the soundtrack

919
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
That gave you the

920
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Bonus songs

921
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Alright well, we'll see, we'll see what happens

922
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I mean, new ideas, never a bad

923
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Thing to try new things, the worst that can happen

924
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Is you fall on your face and fail

925
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But hopefully they'll still keep kind of both

926
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Options available, but we'll see what happens

927
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Who knows

928
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Well it looks like Activision's getting something right

929
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
In the UK and Ireland

930
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
They're actually stating

931
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That there's going to be

932
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
A bundle pack called the Super Bundle

933
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That is for, it's 150 pounds

934
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It has the

935
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Game, the guitar, the microphone, and the drum kit

936
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But you also get a free bass guitar

937
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Well, I mean

938
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You don't have to at least pay the 50 pounds for the guitar

939
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You just have, you just get it in your Super Bundle

940
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's going to be

941
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The same Red Octane

942
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
One

943
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That's the Guitar Hero 3

944
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Peripheral for PS3

945
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
This is UK

946
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Only, just to reiterate

947
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And they're saying that there's a release date

948
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Early November

949
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So

950
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's pretty, pretty

951
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Interesting, I think

952
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But it would be available

953
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
To any retailer

954
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And consumers can pre-order either online or in-store

955
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I want free stuff

956
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It's not fair

957
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, but they're giving them old guitars

958
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But it's free!

959
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh, okay. I give you a kick in the balls

960
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's free

961
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Now

962
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, but unlike a kick in the balls

963
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Which is somewhat entertaining

964
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Sorry, Rob

965
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
How would you know?

966
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm a girl, they're very entertaining to watch

967
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And deliver

968
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You'll never be the recipient of one

969
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Exactly

970
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But anyway

971
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I think that

972
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's actually, first of all

973
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's a good way to get rid of some overstock

974
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
If that's half the case

975
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You could never have too many peripherals

976
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I love peripherals, I have a room in my house

977
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Dedicated to peripherals

978
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You are also a freak in that regard

979
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You know what? You've seen the vault

980
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
No, I mean that with love

981
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But you know you are a freak in that regard

982
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Whereas I won't even get the fucking drum set

983
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
For Rock Band, because I'm like, I just don't need any more shit in my house

984
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But I have a whole room

985
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You know I'm actually getting

986
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You have to get a vault, Rob

987
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
No vault, this is the vault

988
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
My freaking garage is now an internet

989
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Radio station hub

990
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There is room here for a drum kit

991
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Do not want

992
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Pinball machine, yes, drum kit, no

993
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You wanna buy our Black Knight?

994
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm poor

995
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The Rock Band 2 drums are actually being delivered to my work

996
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
On Wednesday

997
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Your wife is gonna punch you in the face

998
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm getting rid of the old ones

999
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm upgrading, whatever

1000
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What are you gonna do with the old ones?

1001
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Give them to my sister, I think

1002
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Anyways

1003
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Some other interesting stuff about Guitar Hero

1004
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And I guess this is a little bit of trivia

1005
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The Metallica mix of their brand new album

1006
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Is actually

1007
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Better in Guitar Hero

1008
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Than it is on the actual CD

1009
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
In fact, the new Death Magnet album

1010
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Has been mixed too loud

1011
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
They say

1012
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And is actually sacrificing audio quality

1013
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
In favor of a louder

1014
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Sounding product

1015
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Well, Guitar Hero on the other hand

1016
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's actually

1017
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
A little bit more balanced

1018
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So you actually have a little bit more depth

1019
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Than the audio in there

1020
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So a lot of people are thinking

1021
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Hey, let's just rip the audio from Guitar Hero instead

1022
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Okay, wouldn't this be a matter of opinion though?

1023
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
No, they actually

1024
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They looked at the audio

1025
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
They actually ran it through

1026
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You know, a

1027
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Waveform editor or whatever

1028
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And it showed, you know, how they had it

1029
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Capped in there for the CD audio

1030
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Versus Guitar Hero

1031
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Which is significantly better on

1032
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Guitar Hero

1033
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Is this one of those things that only like

1034
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Crazy audio files would really notice?

1035
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Like, what about

1036
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Joe Average Headbanger?

1037
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You know, they get some Metallica CDs

1038
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
They may not care, but you know

1039
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I actually did listen to some of the portions of it

1040
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
When they were comparing it

1041
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It does sound distorted

1042
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Sounds like someone just recorded it too loud

1043
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But it's Metallica! It's supposed to be loud!

1044
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You know what I mean?

1045
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's supposed to be loud, but you're supposed to turn up

1046
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Your radio to 11!

1047
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Okay, you're not supposed to record it loud

1048
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And then turn it up, because it'll sound all fucked up

1049
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
They should know this! I mean, hell

1050
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I mean, come on! Hitstun agrees, Hitstun says

1051
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The CD has mad clipping, and Alpha

1052
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Kananagram agrees it's too much clicking

1053
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In our chatroom, chat.com

1054
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I think they should replace everyone's CDs

1055
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That's my opinion

1056
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's that bad? Really?

1057
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Well, I guess so

1058
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Especially when the CD

1059
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
In some regard, the old-fashioned CD market

1060
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Is struggling to survive in a way

1061
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This is a pretty big screw-up

1062
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This is what you get for buying CDs

1063
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm just telling you

1064
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
See, this is what Metallica thinks of you

1065
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
They're all, fuck you guys, we're gonna just record it all fucked up

1066
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Ah, you bought the CD

1067
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Now you're stuck, bitches

1068
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Somehow I doubt that

1069
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You should play Rock Band or Guitar Hero

1070
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Alright, well look, if you want to play more

1071
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Guitar Hero, especially Guitar Hero World Tour

1072
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You can use your

1073
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Rock Band drums with Guitar Hero World Tour

1074
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And this story's kind of making the rounds of the

1075
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Blogs, although I don't know, I thought I already

1076
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Kinda knew some of this, but whatever

1077
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Here's the thing, what happens

1078
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
If you use a Rock Band

1079
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Drum set in Guitar Hero

1080
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
World Tour, and this is kind of

1081
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Demonstrated a World Tour preview event that happened

1082
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Earlier this week

1083
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Basically what'll happen is that the pad

1084
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That's all the way on the right

1085
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
On the five

1086
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Note chart

1087
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Will actually kind of go over

1088
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
To the other orange pad instead

1089
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But sometimes there will be some other

1090
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Logic as well, like if there's

1091
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Already an orange note in there, it might actually

1092
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Move it to a blue note

1093
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So there is, it's not just necessarily

1094
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Eliminating the fifth one altogether

1095
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Like, and I think that's kind of where this is

1096
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Kind of resurfacing in news reports

1097
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Cause I think the early things we thought

1098
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Is that that fifth one would just get eliminated altogether

1099
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But no, those notes are gonna get moved

1100
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Basically to other drops

1101
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Which is kind of neat in a way

1102
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Which is also good for score comparison and everything

1103
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Does it truly keep everything on the same page

1104
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Or what, is this gonna be an advantage?

1105
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Using one controller over the other

1106
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Because one's four and one's five

1107
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't think it matters

1108
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But then again I'm not super duper into drums as well

1109
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Right? Yeah

1110
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So

1111
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So I got sent a link to a YouTube

1112
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That's supposed to compare the two Metallica tracks

1113
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You wanna hear it a little bit?

1114
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I've already listened to it

1115
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Okay

1116
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Okay

1117
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Here's the thing

1118
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I bet you, this is a radio show

1119
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You didn't get to see what we saw on our screen

1120
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Which would show you which clips were guitar hero

1121
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And which clips were the CD

1122
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I bet you people at home couldn't tell the difference

1123
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Now granted this show is delivered at a lower bit rate

1124
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But I think this is one of those things

1125
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And you can see it in the visuals

1126
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Absolutely, you can see, look at the waveforms

1127
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
They absolutely look different

1128
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Where the guitar hero wants to prep

1129
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But what's the audio quality on

1130
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
YouTube?

1131
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Not that great

1132
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So I think you're not gonna be able to tell

1133
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Until you actually have the two side by side

1134
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
In person

1135
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's like, okay, here's an example

1136
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
When Symphony of the Night came out on Saturn

1137
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Dan and I actually did

1138
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
A side by side comparison

1139
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Because we had seen one done

1140
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Online that we couldn't hear the difference in the music quality

1141
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But when we did it on our TV

1142
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
We could

1143
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Have them both running side by side

1144
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Alright, some people in chat rooms say

1145
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yes, I hear the difference, it's very clear

1146
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I don't know, sometimes I think people just want to argue

1147
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But alright, I'm gonna be honest

1148
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
If I closed my eyes, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell you the difference

1149
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
All I can tell you is the metallica

1150
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But I understand, I can see the difference

1151
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Okay, I get the point

1152
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I get what you guys are saying

1153
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I heard the new album is mediocre anyway

1154
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So what do we even care about it?

1155
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's just like saying, you know

1156
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Barney is not in high def quality

1157
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You know, it's just in normal quality

1158
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What the fuck, you know

1159
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It doesn't matter, it's Barney, no one gives a shit

1160
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Hmm

1161
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That's my comparison there

1162
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Alright, well look, not only

1163
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Do we have that going on in the rock band world

1164
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That there is the news about

1165
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
How you're gonna use the rock band drums on Guitar Hero World Tour

1166
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But, hey look, this is a much more

1167
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Important clip, because

1168
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Hey, coming to the rock band download store this week

1169
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Finally

1170
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
After a very, very, very

1171
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Very long wait

1172
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
The real Tom Sawyer

1173
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Hell yeah

1174
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The actual version of Tom Sawyer

1175
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
One of my favorite songs

1176
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Kicking off the Moving Pictures album

1177
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Is finally making its way to a rock band this week

1178
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
They swear, and of course, you know

1179
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Other songs like YYZ, Limelight

1180
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You know, those are all from Moving Pictures

1181
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Not a lot

1182
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Of songs on that album, considering

1183
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It was kind of epic, and the albums were

1184
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Only like 7 or 8 tracks back then

1185
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And that The Camera Eye is an 11

1186
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Freaking minute song

1187
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Epic release is very epic

1188
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And, as if this wasn't enough

1189
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You kind of get the feeling that this

1190
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Late delivery of this album was just added

1191
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
On top of what was already going to be released

1192
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Because you got 6 other just kind of like

1193
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Kind of potpourri songs

1194
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Just kind of a hodgepodge mix

1195
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Of songs from Bad Religion, The Cult

1196
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Hot Hot Heat, Caspian

1197
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Caspian, Sleater Kenny

1198
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And Stone Roses all have songs

1199
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Coming out this week, so

1200
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Very cool

1201
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Very cool

1202
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I may not get the whole album

1203
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But I do love me some Tom Sawyer, that was like one of my favorite

1204
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Songs in the first rock band, and I think the real

1205
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Version is much better than the cover version

1206
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I want to get that at least

1207
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Maybe YYZ or

1208
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Limelight, I don't know yet

1209
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
11 minute song, do not want

1210
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Because that will show up in my random playlist

1211
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Guaranteed

1212
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So I don't want to get the whole album, sorry

1213
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Tom Sawyer

1214
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Is a really, really freaking good

1215
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Song, that's a great album in general

1216
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It is

1217
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Canada knows how to rock, is your proof

1218
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Alright

1219
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So, another

1220
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Interesting thing about Guitar Hero

1221
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And this has been kind of circling around

1222
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
A little bit

1223
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Every instrument that G4 hinted to

1224
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's not really an instrument at all

1225
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It's a MIDI sequencer

1226
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That's right

1227
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
They're going to be adding a MIDI sequencer

1228
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That will allow you to

1229
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Import creations

1230
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Like

1231
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
MIDI files from your PC

1232
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Into Guitar Hero World Tour

1233
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
As well as

1234
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Allowing you to

1235
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I guess

1236
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
At least on the PS3

1237
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
To import different tracks

1238
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Including instruments

1239
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Rhythm lead, guitar, bass

1240
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Keyboards, and drum tracks

1241
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
However on the 360 it will only be limited to drums

1242
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Due to hardware issues

1243
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Which, whatever

1244
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I don't understand what hardware issues they could be having

1245
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That would prevent them from doing this

1246
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But whatever

1247
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So yeah

1248
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I guess kind of interesting

1249
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
No word on price or when it's going to be released

1250
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But

1251
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You're really hardcore into making

1252
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I guess

1253
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Tracks on there

1254
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
That actually sounds kind of awesome though

1255
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I think I'd use it

1256
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I think it's a neat idea for an expansion

1257
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You know the results could be iffy

1258
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But I think that's really taken this franchise

1259
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
In a different direction

1260
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't know how often it will actually be used though

1261
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Tiger Clawed Chat says

1262
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think you could also create techno on that

1263
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Could you?

1264
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Could you make different genres of music and stuff?

1265
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You could make

1266
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Well I was telling them about drum and bass stuff

1267
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
They said that yeah you can make

1268
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Whatever to your heart's content on there

1269
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So you could make a drum and bass

1270
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Track or a techno track if you're that creative

1271
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Interesting

1272
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
That's the only thing that kind of makes me

1273
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Want to buy maybe just the game only version

1274
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Or something

1275
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Just to check that out

1276
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I don't know I'll wait and see

1277
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So Black Wolf and I are having a little bit of an argument

1278
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
In chat room right now over the last story

1279
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And he says Rush is the only good thing

1280
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
To come out of Canada

1281
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And I said wait a minute no no no no

1282
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Degrassi

1283
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Hello

1284
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You can't do that on television

1285
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
He says I still lose

1286
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Degrassi is not a great thing to come out of Canada

1287
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And I think you're full of poop sir

1288
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And what was that show?

1289
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Out of Control

1290
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Out of Control

1291
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000

Kids in the Hall

1293
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And what is that dish

1294
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
With the french fries with gravy

1295
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Poutain or whatever

1296
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That stuff is good

1297
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000

1298
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000

1299
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000

And hockey

1302
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Alright I think Black Wolf is just giving us a hard time

1303
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Now he's really starting to argue with us

1304
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Just for the sake of arguing

1305
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Alright how about some release dates

1306
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
That game is gonna be great

1331
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Forgot that that's actually coming out

1332
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Anyways Nintendo's been doing a great job marketing that

1333
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Oh yeah

1334
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I mean not really

1335
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah that's gonna be a

1336
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
As good as the DS one fortunately

1337
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Who knows maybe there'll be an onslaught of

1338
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Marketing Blitz in the game itself

1339
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I hope so, the game's awesome

1340
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It really is better than I think a lot of people are expecting it to be

1341
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Well

1342
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000

1343
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We've got

1344
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
The Price is Right coming to PC

1345
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000

1346

1347
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000

PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

1349
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Wasn't that Price is Right game supposed to be out last week?

1350
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
This is the PC version

1351
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
They may have delayed it from last week so

1352
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh

1353
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Let's see, same with the Hell's Kitchen PC game

1354
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So I'm guessing it came out last week

1355
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Kirby Superstar Ultra

1356
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
On the DS which they actually did

1357
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Some pretty good marketing for that

1358
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
They had like little Kirby clouds

1359
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Which is kinda neat

1360
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And I doubt this is coming out but apparently the

1361
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Symbol pack, 2 pack

1362
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
2 is supposed to be out

1363
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I heard that it's supposed to be October

1364
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And of course you go to a GameStop and you ask them

1365
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Hey one of the symbols coming at your website says the 22nd

1366
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And we're like I don't know

1367
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So the hell with them

1368
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
You can get a box set of

1369
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000

1384
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Coming to the Wii

1385
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000

And 5 and 6 coming to the DS

1396
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Hey, quick question

1397
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Does anyone give a shit about Brain Quest

1398
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Grade 3, 4, 5, 6

1399
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Cause I'm thinking we can make this segment

1400
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
A little shorter

1401
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
No we can't

1402
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
By cutting out the games that not a single

1403
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
OLR listener cares about, not a one

1404
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
That is being

1405
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Biased right there

1406
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It is completely biased, but also true

1407
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Hey, we've got parents to listen, who knows

1408
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Maybe they want to get something for their kid

1409
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Maybe you're full of poop

1410
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Something that says, hey look, I know you like games, but I hate you

1411
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You know, that kind of thing

1412
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And they might also get them Barbie Fashion Show

1413
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000

Dinosaur King, coming out for the DS

1416
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
What better way to tell your child I hate you

1417
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Sing Star Pop Volume 2

1418
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000

1422
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000

1423
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Line Rider 2

1427
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Unbound on PC

1428
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And DS this week, I believe

1429
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway

1430
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1431
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Also Dragon Ball Z

1432
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
trilogy coming out on Playstation 2

1433
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
We've also got

1434
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Time Hollow on the DS

1435
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Which is a Konami

1436
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Role-playing game

1437
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Pipe Mania is a puzzle game

1438
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Kind of like Pipe Dream

1439
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And also the hacking in Bioshock

1440
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
That's on PSP

1441
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And I want to say the Wii also

1442
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Lego Batman

1443
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Pretty much on every single system out there

1444
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Playstation 2, 3

1445
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
360, Wii, DS, and PSP

1446
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Lost in Blue Shipwrecked on the Wii

1447
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
My Japanese coach

1448
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That moved to October

1449
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So that date's wrong

1450
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Bastards have incorrect dates on their website

1451
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Rebel Raiders

1452
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
On the Wii

1453
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Although that game sucks balls

1454
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So I wouldn't recommend buying it

1455
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Lots of stuff this week, I guess

1456
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000

1457
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000

Samba de Amigo

1460
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Coming out on Wii this week

1461
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And I believe the Maracas come out this week as well

1462
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000

1464
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000

1465
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I think we're almost done here

1466
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000

1467
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Sorry

1468
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Hi Hamtaro Ham Ham Challenge

1469
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Cause it's a cute hamster game on the DS

1470
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And

1471
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Disgaea DS

1472
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Disgaea DS

1473
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Is gonna be coming out as well

1474
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And

1475
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
God damn there's a lot of shit this week

1476
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Come on

1477
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Well while you're trying to figure it out

1478
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I looked up cause I was curious

1479
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
What's on that Sing Star Pop Volume 2

1480
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And kind of an interesting

1481
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
mix of songs

1482
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Nelly Furtado, Permisqueous

1483
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Jenny from the Block by Jennifer Lopez

1484
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
This is definitely a top 40 mix here

1485
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Fergie, Big Girls Don't Cry

1486
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The Sweet Escape, Gwen Stefani

1487
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And uh

1488
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I don't know Dark Soccer maybe you'll like this one

1489
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Rihanna, Umbrella, Ella

1490
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Ella, A

1491
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I actually don't like that song

1492
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I like the remix

1493
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Under My Umbrella, Ella, Ella, A

1494
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I only like the remix

1495
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Alright alright enough of that

1496
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
That's annoying seriously

1497
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Rhapsody a Musical Adventure on the DS

1498
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Rob

1499
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
What?

1500
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Knock it out

1501
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Can I turn off her mic? How do I unplug her mic?

1502
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I don't know

1503
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Pitfall, The Big Adventure on the Wii

1504
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And that's it

1505
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Done

1506
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Finally, alright no I'm just kidding

1507
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Alright let's look at Japan release dates and see what's coming out over in Japan this week

1508
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
On the 25th

1509
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
The Japanese language version

1510
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Of Infinite Undiscovery and the English language version

1511
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Make their way to regions outside Japan

1512
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Sometimes I get some general

1513
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Asia release dates

1514
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Like I said this Friday for regions outside Japan

1515
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
But in Japan you get a game called

1516
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Janline comes out in Japan this Friday

1517
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Also Madden NFL 09

1518
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And Tiger Woods PGA Tour on 09

1519
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Finally come out in Japan this Friday

1520
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Because they usually get localized versions of our sports games

1521
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Just a little later than we do

1522
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Also coming out on the

1523
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
PlayStation 3

1524
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Aquanauts Holiday comes out in Japan

1525
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
From Sony Entertainment

1526
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Also a new headset will come out

1527
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Madden NFL 09

1528
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Quest for Booty comes out

1529
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Again that's an Asia release not just Japan

1530
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But just Japan would be

1531
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09

1532
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Going to some of the other systems

1533
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Taking a look at the

1534
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Nintendo Wii

1535
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Bomberman comes out on

1536
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
September 25th as does

1537
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Disaster Day of Crisis

1538
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
SimCity Creator

1539
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
The simple 2000 series for the Wii

1540
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The Table Game volume 1

1541
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So Loki you like the simple series on the

1542
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Game Boy Advance right?

1543
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So now they have these games coming out on the Wii

1544
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I used to check out some of the stuff on the PlayStation 2

1545
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
The Wii stuff

1546
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I've gotten like a couple

1547
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But I haven't actually played them

1548
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
They have all the kind of weird stuff

1549
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I don't play my Zhong

1550
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So a lot of that doesn't apply to me

1551
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
An interesting looking game called

1552
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Soul Eater Monotone Princess

1553
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Also comes out from Squeenix on the Wii

1554
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So that's a Square Enix game

1555
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And it looks a little bit like

1556
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Action kind of mixed with the whole

1557
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Anime type of cutscenes

1558
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Going on so

1559
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Looks like it could be interesting if you're a fan of those types of games

1560
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
That's it for the Nintendo Wii this week

1561
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Let's take a look at the

1562
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
PlayStation 2 since they're still cranking stuff out for that

1563
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And I do want to point out

1564
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Secret of Evangelion is going to be

1565
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
A best hit now in Japan

1566
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
As of September 25th

1567
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So will Angel Profile that will also be

1568
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Getting a price reduction

1569
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But if you're looking for some new stuff

1570
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Anyway there's quite a bit

1571
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
There's Super Robot Taisen Z comes out

1572
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
As well as Sugar Plus Spice

1573
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Anoko no Suteken no Name no Kamo

1574
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Comes out as well

1575
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And let's see

1576
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Soul Cradle

1577
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Well that's another best hit

1578
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
How about this one though

1579
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Nojizaka

1580
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Tsunku no Himitsu

1581
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Cosplay

1582
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Hajime Mashita

1583
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
That is the game coming out

1584
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And all I have to say is that

1585
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's got a girl dressed as a maid

1586
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
On the cover of it

1587
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And some of the screenshots from the game

1588
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Some of the screenshots from the game

1589
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Topless Bathing Sun Beauties

1590
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Actually inside the game

1591
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And Women in Nurse Outfits

1592
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Sweet

1593
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Oh the name of it right there

1594
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Jamie's looking at the name there

1595
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
To see if she can figure out

1596
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I see Secret Cosplay

1597
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Secret Cosplay

1598
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Looks like a lot of fanboy fantasies might come true

1599
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
With that game so you might want to check that out

1600
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I think it's a fetish game

1601
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Nice

1602
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000

1611
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Also lastly

1612
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
On the Sony PSP

1613
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Taking a look to see if anything

1614
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Is coming out next week

1615
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Patapon gets a price reduction

1616
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Because that game has been very popular

1617
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Princess Maker 5 portable

1618
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
It is a Princess Maker week

1619
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
PSP and a price reduction on the DS

1621
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
What a week

There you have it your Japanese release dates

1623
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Alright let's get back

1624
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Into some news

1625
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
After the release dates

1626
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Well in other news

1627
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Sorry

1628
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And this is actually very happy for me

1629
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Because I love

1630
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Freaking Metal Slug

1631
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Don't we all know this already right?

1632
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I heard a rumor

1633
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Well

1634
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It looks like

1635
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
SNK is going to be

1636
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Doing

1637
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
A high def

1638
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Version sort of like

1639
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
How some of the other old school games

1640
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Have gone

1641
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So that might be cool

1642
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I just want it to still play

1643
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Like Metal Slug

1644
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I don't want it to be 3D

1645
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I want it to be 2D

1646
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
With very high res pretty

1647
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Pretty pretties

1648
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Well I think that's probably what they're going to do

1649
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Because they did the same thing with King of Fighters 12

1650
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yeah

1651
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
But I think

1652
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
A lot of times

1653
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
This has happened with a lot of different franchises

1654
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Originally

1655
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
2D that they've put to 3D

1656
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Is that if they

1657
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Try to like

1658
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Okay remember the Street Fighter EX series

1659
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Now I liked the later EX games

1660
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
But they still weren't right

1661
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Or

1662
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Fogger going 3D

1663
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Yeah something was always weird about that

1664
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah so I think that they would be in their best interest

1665
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
To keep the 2D

1666
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Or to go the

1667
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You know what I mean by the 2.5D

1668
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
They're doing

1669
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
You know where it's 3D but plays 2D

1670
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I'm all for the 2.5D

1671
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Like what was it

1672
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Fantasy Zone

1673
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
The Sega Ages one that I have

1674
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It still played

1675
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Just like the 2D one

1676
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It was all cel shaded

1677
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
You couldn't really tell it was 3D

1678
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Except it would do rotations in some places

1679
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It gave it a little bit more depth to it

1680
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I think that they should do something

1681
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Like that

1682
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
In the high res route

1683
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Well we'll see if we get more information on this soon

1684
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Let's see

1685
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Well in other news

1686
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And this is actually pretty cool

1687
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Nintendo may actually have a chance to redeem itself

1688
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
They're actually holding a media summit

1689
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
In early October

1690
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Supposedly on the 2nd and 3rd

1691
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
This has already been confirmed for Japan

1692
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
But what they're going to talk about

1693
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Who knows

1694
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But the event also

1695
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
There's supposed to be a US event as well

1696
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Taking place in San Francisco around the same time

1697
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Guesses of course

1698
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Would be the announcement of Disaster Day of Crisis

1699
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Since it's already been announced

1700
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
For the Japanese market

1701
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Obviously since it's coming out next week

1702
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And for Europe

1703
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Because it's coming out in October

1704
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
But no word on

1705
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
A US release yet

1706
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And

1707
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Other rumors or thoughts maybe

1708
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
That they're going to announce that

1709
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Conduit's being published by them now

1710
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Maybe some new games or something like that

1711
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But we'll have to see

1712
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Maybe a storage solution

1713
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Who knows

1714
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I would like to hear that

1715
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
That would be a wonderful announcement

1716
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
We'll see

1717
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Well you know it's almost kind of like

1718
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It was a fanboy story almost going around a while back

1719
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
That Microsoft

1720
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You've probably heard this before

1721
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Nintendo

1722
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
What if oh yeah Microsoft's going to buy Nintendo

1723
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Especially kind of back before the Wii was announced

1724
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Used to hear these kind of rumors

1725
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Remember hearing this like oh yeah

1726
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Microsoft's going to buy Nintendo and they're going to conquer the world

1727
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Well what's kind of interesting

1728
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
There actually

1729
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Was kind of a little bit of truth to that

1730
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And that was explained by Peter Moore

1731
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Who was talking in an interview this week

1732
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
He actually mentioned during the interview

1733
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Balmer wanted to know

1734
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And that was an individual that he worked with at Microsoft

1735
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Wanted to know how he was going to win

1736
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
For Microsoft

1737
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
How we were going to take on Sony

1738
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
How we would compete with or acquire Nintendo

1739
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Those were the conversations in those days

1740
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It was a classic build or buy conversation

1741
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Interestingly we were just completely fixated on Sony

1742
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Nintendo didn't even come into the conversation

1743
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Notice that way he said that though

1744
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Compete with or acquire

1745
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Nintendo

1746
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But now after the massive success of the Wii

1747
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
The world may never know what would have happened

1748
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
If Microsoft and Nintendo had merged

1749
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Very interesting huh

1750
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
But it might also kind of give some background as to why

1751
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Microsoft is a little more willing to put some of their

1752
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Stuff out on DS like Viva Pinata

1753
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Kind of has that DS game

1754
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And they're not really competing with Nintendo on that market

1755
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
They really have their heart set on Sony

1756
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Black Wolf chimes in and says

1757
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Nintendo laughed at Microsoft

1758
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
They actually did have a meeting

1759
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And you know when you've got a very

1760
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Very American company and a very

1761
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Very Japanese company in that regard

1762
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It kind of doesn't surprise me

1763
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
You know what I mean

1764
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So I think sometimes our perspective

1765
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Might be a little skewed being over here

1766
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
What's just a ginormous company

1767
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And what power Nintendo has

1768
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But it's interesting that in some

1769
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Regards in that way they've kind of worked together

1770
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
A bit

1771
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Well

1772
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Other neat things

1773
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Nintendo of course they only

1774
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Teased us very briefly

1775
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
During the E3 media

1776
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Event

1777
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars now

1778
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
There's a little bit more details coming out from

1779
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Nintendo Power

1780
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And the game itself is actually

1781
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Going to be a cel-shaded

1782
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Isometric game

1783
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It is still going to be M-rated

1784
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Of course it's still going to be a crime drama

1785
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
They actually had some screenshots to look

1786
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It sort of resembles I guess

1787
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
A little bit like the

1788
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Old Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2

1789
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Just kind of shot a little different

1790
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Kind of

1791
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Grand Theft Auto cell phone games that they had

1792
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
But it looks neat

1793
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
It'll be interesting to check out

1794
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
They said that the

1795
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So as a Grand Theft Auto fan

1796
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
You're interested

1797
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm interested to check it out

1798
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Some of the artwork looks kind of weird

1799
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
But it'll be interesting to see how the game plays

1800
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Be definitely willing to

1801
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Check it out because it's Grand Theft Auto

1802
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And I love Grand Theft Auto

1803
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
They were saying though that

1804
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It's going to be a sizable

1805
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Or the game's going to take place in a sizable

1806
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Portion of Liberty City

1807
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
The map has

1808
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Been altered from of course the console version

1809
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Which only makes sense

1810
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
And the missions will also be shorter and can

1811
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Easily be restarted upon failure

1812
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
The D-pad is going to be used for aiming

1813
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
While the R button activates in

1814
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Auto-targeting

1815
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And there's going to be a subtle

1816
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Auto-steering built into

1817
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
The driving controls as well so you can

1818
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Shoe out the window and stuff like that

1819
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
But they're going to bring back the over the top weapons

1820
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Like the minigun, the flamethrowers

1821
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And pretty much a lot of the stuff that was in

1822
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Like say

1823
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2

1824
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
So it'll be pretty cool

1825
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And it's still due out this winter

1826
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Which I think January is the month

1827
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Very interesting

1828
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I want to backtrack just a little bit going to the last story

1829
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Because sometimes our chat room is a little behind

1830
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Because of the delay from when we say something to when it goes out over the radio

1831
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But kind of a comment on

1832
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
The whole Microsoft Nintendo thing and how

1833
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Microsoft kind of plays nicely with the DS

1834
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Tigerclaw gives an interesting comment in our chat room

1835
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
chat.orangelsonshooter.com

1836
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Microsoft is sort of getting into the handheld

1837
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Gaming market with the release of the second gen

1838
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Zune which will play

1839
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Games so that's true this new

1840
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Zune thing they got does the games

1841
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
But at the same time I kind of when I first read that

1842
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I saw it more of a response to the iPhone

1843
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm not so much

1844
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The DS but I mean it's an interesting

1845
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Point though it's not that like

1846
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Microsoft doesn't do handheld games of any sort

1847
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
But I sort of see it more as like an iPhone

1848
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Type of game in my opinion

1849
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I have a feeling that

1850
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
If they were to get into the handheld market

1851
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
It wouldn't be with the Zune

1852
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And if they did I don't think they'd have trouble

1853
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Passing up the PSP

1854
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
The DS on the other hand

1855
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
The DS on the other hand though I don't think

1856
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
They'll be

1857
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Well one game that probably won't find its way

1858
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
To the Zune unless they find some way to

1859
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Have a spin off would be Halo

1860
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Halo 3 specifically and Halo 3

1861
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Is going to be getting a new title update

1862
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And guess when it's coming?

1863
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Tuesday September the 23rd so maybe by the time

1864
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
A lot of you guys hear this

1865
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Halo 3 update will be there it's going to be an automatic download

1866
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You may have to kind of clear out the cash

1867
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
First though before the download will actually

1868
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Happen there but once you get the new updates

1869
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
There's going to be a brand new ranking system

1870
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Some changes to the playlist

1871
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Some brand new achievements which will be cool

1872
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
A complete overhaul to Bungie.net

1873
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Which is pretty cool and the Bungie.net

1874
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Website is slowly changing throughout the next week

1875
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So pretty cool there

1876
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And I know some of you achievement whores are very excited

1877
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
About new achievements so you'll be able to check that out

1878
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
This Tuesday with the free update

1879
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
To Halo 3

1880
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So there you go

1881
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Well in

1882
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Other MMO news

1883
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
There actually have been some more details put out

1884
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
About Star Trek Online

1885
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I know that a few of us have been looking forward to this

1886
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
They actually said

1887
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
On the website that there are going

1888
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
To be more

1889
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Details coming out soon but for right now

1890
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
The ships are going to be something

1891
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Like naval combat

1892
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Using traditional MMO game

1893
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Gameplay

1894
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Klingon ships are going to be

1895
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Different

1896
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
A bit more reflecting of

1897
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Their culture

1898
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Everything will be very customizable

1899
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You can modify and customize

1900
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
The uniforms of the characters but they still have to look like

1901
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
A uniform

1902
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So the options are going to

1903
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Be things from the show and bring in some new things

1904
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
So it's supposed to be cool

1905
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And is it supposed to be out in the next three years?

1906
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
That's

1907
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
A long wait

1908
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That sometimes means more towards

1909
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
The end of that three years so like

1910
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
2011 that's going to be a long wait

1911
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Whew

1912
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I hope it's worth it

1913
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Definitely

1914
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Well other

1915
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Fun PC games of course

1916
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Spore

1917
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
One of the biggest complaints about Spore

1918
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Of course is some of the DRM restrictions

1919
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Well EA has heard your pleas

1920
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And they have decided to loosen them up

1921
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
A bit so now

1922
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Some of the changes that they've had

1923
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And of course without

1924
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You know of course they were

1925
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Bitching and moaning about having to do it

1926
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
But they did it anyways

1927
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
They expanded the number of eligible

1928
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Machines that you can install the product on

1929
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
From three to five

1930
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
They will offer ways for you to

1931
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Request additional activations

1932
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Where warranted

1933
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And also developing a system that

1934
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Will allow the consumer to deauthorize machines

1935
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And move authorizations to new machines

1936
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And on top of that

1937
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
As well they're going to allow you to

1938
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Log in multiple characters

1939
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Into each account

1940
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So you're going to be able to have I think up to

1941
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Five different

1942
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Players

1943
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
On each

1944
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Of your activations

1945
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So that's kind of cool

1946
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I wish they would get rid of secure ROM though

1947
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That's the part that's kind of weird

1948
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
But you know at least they're trying to meet you halfway on this stuff

1949
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I think that's the one component that really still needs to happen

1950
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Is that whole secure ROM thing

1951
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
But at the same time it's kind of like you know

1952
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
If you think there's going to be no DRM in these games

1953
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Whatsoever, dream on

1954
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I mean that's just the way it's going to be

1955
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
This is the day and age we live in

1956
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
This is what they're going to try to do to protect their games

1957
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Although it still does kind of suck that you know

1958
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Days before the release and the legitimate users

1959
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Have to suffer

1960
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's just like having a car alarm in your car

1961
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I mean it's not going to prevent people from

1962
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Stealing stuff out of your car

1963
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It just makes it more difficult

1964
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And it's just like you know the secure ROM stuff

1965
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And the DRM stuff, it's just going to make people

1966
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Have to try that much harder to

1967
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Crack it to be able to steal your product

1968
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And make it as hard for them as possible

1969
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Although it's not very hard

1970
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
And it's not

1971
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Too much of an inconvenience

1972
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It's not at all an issue

1973
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
It's not as easy as say you know

1974
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Bob down the street gets a game

1975
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And there's no DRM and just copies it

1976
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
For all of his friends

1977
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Well one game that's very hard to copy

1978
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Because you have to have your own individual

1979
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Account to play online

1980
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
These are the games that are hard to copy

1981
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
MMOs

1982
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Unless you have the whole private server and that whole stuff

1983
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
But hey, World of Warcraft obviously

1984
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Doesn't have too big a problem with piracy

1985
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Because they've got what like 7 million people playing the game

1986
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And they are all looking forward to the brand new expansion

1987
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Wrath of the Lich King

1988
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Which finally got dated this week

1989
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
November 13th, 2008

1990
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
If you have some war crack addicted friends

1991
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Expect them to call in sick on this day

1992
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Because they probably will be

1993
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Working on heading up to Northrend

1994
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And some of the new areas up there like the Howling Fjord

1995
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And trying to level the characters to 80

1996
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Maybe playing some Lake Wintergrasp

1997
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Running some of the new instances

1998
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Leveling Inscription

1999
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Or their new Death Knight

2000
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Millions of different things to do in the new Warcraft expansion

2001
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I'm looking forward to the dance studio

2002
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Myself

2003
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You can teach characters new dances now apparently

2004
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Which is badly needed

2005
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And also you can get your characters some haircuts

2006
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
So very interesting

2007
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
How you can almost

2008
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Micro manage

2009
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Even more

2010
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
That's the last thing our MMO needed

2011
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
More micromanaging

2012
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Well there's a new add on coming to

2013
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
World of Warcraft

2014
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And it's Bejeweled

2015
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Oddly enough this game started off

2016
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
As a third party knock off

2017
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Bejeweled

2018
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It was called Becharted

2019
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And the developer from Willer

2020
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Actually

2021
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Kind of made it as a method

2022
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Of killing time during long raids

2023
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And farming sessions

2024
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
But apparently

2025
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
PopCap caught wind of it

2026
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And instead of having them

2027
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Stop making it

2028
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
They actually

2029
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Wanted him to

2030
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Or they hired him on to create a more polished

2031
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Version of the application

2032
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
That will be released for the game

2033
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So you'll be able to play

2034
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Bejeweled

2035
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And my wife was excited to hear this

2036
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
So now if your wife gets sucked into

2037
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Getting World of Warcraft

2038
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Yeah she's just going to be playing Bejeweled

2039
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And they're just sitting there playing Bejeweled

2040
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I know

2041
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
World of Warcraft is the best game ever

2042
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Cause it has

2043
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Bejeweled in it

2044
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So no you were telling this on Bobby's show

2045
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I don't think you told it on our show though

2046
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
The wife is actually signing up for a Warcraft account

2047
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Thanks to Extifer

2048
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
She's trying the 14 day trial

2049
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
She may actually do

2050
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
A month in 14 days because

2051
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Extifer wants to get I guess you get some

2052
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Recruitment bonuses or something like that

2053
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Kind of like the military or something where you get

2054
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Like a special mounts

2055
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Or triple experience or some shit

2056
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I don't know it's retarded but

2057
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
So she may

2058
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Indulge him in that but

2059
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yeah she's going to try it

2060
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I have to install it on this laptop that I'm using

2061
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Right now cause

2062
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
You're that I buy her a new laptop

2063
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
She wants me to buy her a Mac and I'm like

2064
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Fuck that shit

2065
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Oh my god

2066
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I think now the wife is purposely trying to get into

2067
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Things that you don't like just to

2068
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Piss you off I don't know

2069
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I don't think she

2070
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
The thing is you have to know her

2071
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
She doesn't have the patience for it

2072
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And she's going to quit like very fast

2073
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I will be very surprised

2074
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
If she actually

2075
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
We should take bets on what level

2076
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Nellie will quit at

2077
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
How far she gets her character up before she quits

2078
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I'm down with that

2079
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
What would the bet be?

2080
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I don't know

2081
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Like what does the loser have to do

2082
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Or what does the loser get

2083
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Or win or get

2084
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I don't know I don't even care

2085
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
DarkSakura can you think of anything

2086
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
That's not too extreme like no tingle dressing up

2087
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
For a bet like this

2088
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
We have to poop? Well I think everybody does that

2089
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
On a semi regular basis if you're not

2090
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
You might want to see a doctor

2091
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Alright

2092
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
We'll figure something out maybe make a bet

2093
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
In part B

2094
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I just don't think she'll have the time for this game

2095
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Seriously I think she'll probably

2096
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Level to about 5 and then stop

2097
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
We'll see

2098
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
We'll see

2099
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Alright anyhow hey

2100
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Maybe there's some other games that Loki's wife

2101
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Should be checking out because there's a classic

2102
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Gaming archive that dates

2103
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Years and years and years that have

2104
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of games

2105
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
In it and every week

2106
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Here on this program DarkSakura selects

2107
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
One of them to highlight here

2108
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
On this program and we call it the classic

2109
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Video game of the week

2110
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
So what should the

2111
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Kids be playing this week DarkSakura?

2112
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
For lack of a better

2113
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Game I picked Snake Rattle and Roll

2114
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Because I know it's a

2115
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
A game that somebody I

2116
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Think is great really likes

2117
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So um

2118
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Oh me? No

2119
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I really like it

2120
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
No I put it on there for

2121
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Sauce although I think it's been a while since

2122
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
She's played it but it was a game that was

2123
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Made by Rare

2124
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And it came out on the NES

2125
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
In 1990 it's one of the

2126
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Earliest platform games

2127
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
It was a 3D isometric playing field sort of like

2128
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
How Marble Madness was

2129
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
They uh

2130
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Actually it didn't really sell all that

2131
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Great but it was actually kind of a fun little game

2132
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It was really difficult too

2133
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
But the whole point is that you are two snakes called

2134
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Rattle and Roll and you have to eat these little things

2135
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Called Nibley Pibleys and race to the moon

2136
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So

2137
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
That's what you play. There was supposed to be a sequel

2138
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Called Snakes to Snakes but

2139
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
It was never made but there was Sneaky Snakes

2140
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
For Game Boy in 1991

2141
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And it had a version come out on

2142
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Sega on the uh

2143
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Mega Drive in 1993

2144
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
So that's pretty cool

2145
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I never knew there was a Mega Drive version of this

2146
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It's kind of neat

2147
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Huh. Well I like this game quite a bit

2148
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
It's actually a lot of fun. I'm kind of sad we never got that sequel

2149
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And this is a Rare game

2150
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So yet again here's another great

2151
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Franchise that Rare could go back and revisit

2152
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Someday on I don't know Xbox Live

2153
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Arcade but I somehow think they never will

2154
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Which is sad

2155
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It makes me cry

2156
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Alright

2157
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Well it looks like that's it. That's your classic game of the week folks

2158
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Snake, Rattle and Roll

2159
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
For the Nintendo Entertainment System

2160
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
But also on the Mega Drive apparently

2161
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Which I just learned tonight

2162
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Alright on that note

2163
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
We're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back

2164
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

2165
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And yes we're going to talk about Mega Man 9

2166
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
We'll also talk about a new sweet code and game

2167
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And we'll talk about Project Gotham Racing 5

2168
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It's all coming up in part B

2169
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So hey don't go anywhere we'll be right back

2170
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Having a bad day

2171
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Job getting you down

2172
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Are you looking for something to pick you up

2173
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Give you a laugh all at the same time

2174
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Then oh brother do I have the show for you

2175
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I am Brad Boyer

2176
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And join me each week on The Geek Spin

2177
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
As I scour the net to bring you the best

2178
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
In comedy music

2179
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Check us out

2180
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:26,000
www.thegeekspin.com

2181
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Ladies and gentlemen

2182
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Rape isn't funny

2183
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Unless if it's clown rape

2184
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Rape of people is not funny

2185
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Rape of monsters is funny

2186
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Because monsters are bad

2187
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And when bad people

2188
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
What I'm just not going to keep going

2189
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I'm digging myself a hole

2190
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I'm Brad

2191
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I'm Glenn

2192
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And I'm Christina

2193
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And we're from the Pod Culture Podcast

2194
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And podculture.net

2195
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
When you're done here and you find yourself hungry

2196
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
With some more geeky goodness

2197
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Head on over and check us out

2198
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
At podculture.net

2199
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
From A-plus shows to Grade Z movies

2200
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And everything else in between

2201
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Like comics and video games

2202
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Along with the occasional special musical guest

2203
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
There's something for the geek in us all

2204
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
And head on over to our little corner of the verse

2205
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000

2206

2207
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Equal Opportunity Geek Month

2208
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:58,000
See you soon

2209
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Welcome back

2210
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Kids to Orange Lounge Radio

2211
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Here on this lovely Sunday evening

2212
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
September the 21st, 2008

2213
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Five weeks to go until episode 300

2214
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
If you can believe it

2215
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Yes, we've been on the air that long

2216
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
To have done 300 weekly episodes

2217
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
You know, and obviously we've missed a week here and there

2218
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
So, you know, it's taken us a little over six years to get here

2219
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
But quite an accomplishment

2220
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I don't know many other shows, if any, that have gotten to the 300 weekly show mark

2221
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
So, yeah, now we're trying to decide what exactly we're going to do to celebrate

2222
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
We're going to try to get some big guests on the show that week

2223
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I know that I'm going to try to start sending some emails this week

2224
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And just have a potpourri of big names on the show that week

2225
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
But otherwise I'm not sure what other surprises we have in store

2226
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
But if you have suggestions please email us

2227
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Or email me directly

2228
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
You can get all our contact information on the website

2229
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Anyhow, we've got lots more gaming news to discuss

2230
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And only a little bit of time to do it

2231
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
So let's get back to it

2232
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
During the break we heard some music from the new Mega Man 9

2233
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Unfortunately folks on the podcast don't get to hear that

2234
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Because, you know, the whole copyright and all that stuff we can't offer it up for download

2235
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
But the live listeners did hear it

2236
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And I believe Loki's going to start us off with some Mega Man 9 news tonight

2237
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Yes, in fact, if you liked Mega Man 9's music

2238
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
You're going to like it even more when you can actually buy the game

2239
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Which comes out on the 22nd

2240
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Or tomorrow if you're listening to us live

2241
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
On the WiiWare download service

2242
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
If you do not own a Wii and you own a PS3

2243
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You'll be able to purchase it on the Playstation Network on the 25th

2244
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And if you want it on the 360

2245
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Well you're going to have to wait until October 1st

2246
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
But it will be available soon

2247
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And that's awesome

2248
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Another thing that will be available shortly after all that comes out

2249
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Is some download content for Mega Man 9

2250
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And the first new playable character they're going to include

2251
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Is Protoman

2252
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And you're going to actually be able to use him

2253
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Some of the stuff that you get like the rush adapters

2254
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Actually change to proto adapters in the game

2255
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And including like the proto sled, proto coil, etc

2256
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I guess it's all just kind of

2257
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I'm sorry, it's just crazy that there's download content

2258
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
For like an old school Nintendo game in a way

2259
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
It's just kind of cool, I don't know why

2260
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
It's just really really cool

2261
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Yes, so that will be available on October 6th

2262
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
For $2 or the equivalent thereof

2263
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And by the way, even though we can't play the entire Mega Man 9 soundtrack

2264
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Or so on the live show

2265
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
We can play a little clip

2266
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
So here's what some of the music sounds like

2267
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Here's a clip from Tornado Man's stage

2268
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
So you can see it has all that same retro goodness

2269
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Of the old school Mega Man games

2270
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Like you knew it was going to have

2271
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And some other cool stuff

2272
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
If you happen to be all nostalgic

2273
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
And love playing Mega Man 9

2274
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Well, I don't know if you remember that fake

2275
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Well I guess old school box art they had

2276
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Going out for Mega Man 9

2277
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
The really human face for Mega Man

2278
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
That was scary, yeah

2279
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
You now can actually purchase the fake box

2280
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
A fake NES cart

2281
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And I guess it may come with the asset CD

2282
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
That they were handing out before

2283
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Because these were for press release stuff

2284
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
They had screenshots and all sorts of stuff

2285
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
But they are available on the Capcom store

2286
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
So you can find those at capcom-unity.com

2287
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And they will be exceedingly rare

2288
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
So if you're interested in getting it

2289
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
You might want to put an order in as soon as possible

2290
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It's kind of neat

2291
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah, how much do you think those things will start going for on eBay?

2292
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Who knows? Quite a bit I'd imagine

2293
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Anyone in here planning to get that game this week?

2294
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Yes

2295
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I think we're going to

2296
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Jamie of course having a little trouble with her voice tonight

2297
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Because of the allergies

2298
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
But I think she just said she

2299
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
They think they're going to get it this week

2300
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I want to because I think the d-pad on the Wii is pretty awesome

2301
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Whereas the d-pad on the 360 not so awesome

2302
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
However, I love achievement points

2303
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
So therefore I will be getting out of that too

2304
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Yeah, I think I'm going to be holding off on the 360 version

2305
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Even though the controller bugs the crap out of me

2306
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'm kind of hoping that's one of the things Microsoft is going to fix in 09

2307
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Based on what we saw at the Leipzig show

2308
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
At least I'm hoping

2309
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
We'll see

2310
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Anyhow, other games and other big franchises that people are really excited about

2311
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Suikoden!

2312
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I know we got a few Suikoden fans in the house

2313
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
A brand new Suikoden game was announced for DS

2314
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
It's not a numbered Suikoden game

2315
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
But a new game called Suikoden Tier Crease is the new game that's coming out

2316
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
And this is kind of neat

2317
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
What's kind of cool about this game

2318
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Again, the big niche of the Suikoden series

2319
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
You could say is that it's a classic JRPG

2320
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
But you have 108 characters in it

2321
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
There's just tons and tons and tons of characters

2322
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
What's kind of cool about this one is that

2323
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
With the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection now

2324
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You can actually play where you're leveling one of the 108 people

2325
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
But somebody else can level the other characters

2326
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And you can all participate in leveling up the different characters

2327
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
So it provides a new way to level up characters

2328
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And creates a little bit of a community

2329
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And apparently when they say Nintendo Wi-Fi connection

2330
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
They are talking the internet

2331
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Not just a local Wi-Fi connection

2332
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
So that could be very interesting

2333
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I'm kind of curious to see how this plays out

2334
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
So more information to come on that

2335
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Apparently this was shown at a Konami event

2336
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
That we weren't invited to this year

2337
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Sad

2338
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
But I heard it was in New York

2339
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That's probably why

2340
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Yeah

2341
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
It wasn't on our coast

2342
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I'm sure it was

2343
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Oh well

2344
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
They couldn't fly us out there

2345
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Even though they flew everybody else out there

2346
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Oh well

2347
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Not that we're going to be bitter much

2348
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
But we can't really tell you much more about the game

2349
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Because we didn't see it

2350
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Oh darn

2351
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I couldn't play Rock Revolution

2352
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Maybe have a positive

2353
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Do you think maybe that's why you didn't get invited?

2354
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Well

2355
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
No I don't think so

2356
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
But hey

2357
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
You know what

2358
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
If the game stinks we're not going to hold back at the same time

2359
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
It's more important we have integrity

2360
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Than you know

2361
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I could have

2362
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
But see that's the thing

2363
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I'm only taking it based off of

2364
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
You know screenshots and stuff

2365
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
That's not very accurate

2366
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
And with you know

2367
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Out playing it

2368
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I can't really give you my true impression

2369
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
But whatever

2370
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Who cares

2371
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It's not important

2372
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So anyway

2373
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Sweet Coding looks interesting though

2374
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I you know

2375
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I've missed out on some of the more recent Sweet Coding games

2376
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
But I did enjoy the ones on Playstation 1

2377
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
So I might have a reason to check it out

2378
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I think the online component sounds neat

2379
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So Peter Molyneux

2380
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
He actually of course

2381
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Has this little game coming out called Fable 2

2382
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
And you may remember

2383
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
There were some games released on Xbox Live Arcade

2384
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Called the Fable 2 Pub Games

2385
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Where you can earn gold to use in the actual game

2386
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Well of course people found you know

2387
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Exploits and glitches

2388
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
To be able to make a lot of money really quick

2389
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
And according to Peter Molyneux

2390
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
That was intentional

2391
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
And that they're going to be in for a surprise

2392
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
When they actually start the game

2393
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And of course now there's

2394
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
You know a patch being put out that fixes that

2395
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And all that stuff

2396
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Somehow I think he's full of shit

2397
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
To be honest

2398
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And I don't think it was intentional

2399
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
And I think maybe if you try it with this new patch

2400
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It will do trigger something

2401
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
But I think

2402
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
If you're doing it and besides you can also

2403
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
You know clear out your hard drive cache or whatever

2404
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And erase these updates and cheat anyways

2405
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I don't think it's going to matter

2406
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I'm kind of curious to see what happens

2407
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I do claim bullshit on the fact that it was premeditated

2408
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
But I think there is some legitimacy

2409
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
To the fact that something will happen in the game

2410
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
If you cheat it I think they will be able to

2411
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Enable that

2412
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Because sometimes even if you buy it

2413
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Like even if the game had already like pretty much gone gold

2414
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Or whatever and there wasn't time to add in

2415
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Something to you know get the cheaters

2416
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
They could patch it in

2417
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
When the release happens

2418
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Because how many times have you bought a new Xbox game

2419
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And it patches day one

2420
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Well I know that

2421
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I'm not saying something about the game

2422
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I'm saying that the Xbox Live Arcade game

2423
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Is going to have to be patched

2424
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
In order for it to be able to detect the cheating

2425
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Because I think that you're going to try it

2426
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And you know if you try the same technique

2427
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
To cheat now

2428
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Now that they have it patched in

2429
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
That it's going to raise a flag or something

2430
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
That's going to cause it to you know trigger in the game

2431
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
If you're that worried about it

2432
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Just flush your you know

2433
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Your Fable 2 pub games file

2434
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And flush your hard drive

2435
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Exactly just do it offline or whatever

2436
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And the patch is actually already live according to Zushi

2437
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yes it is already live

2438
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
And so I haven't actually played the pub games yet

2439
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Even though I got them

2440
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Yeah I played them for like five minutes

2441
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
And honestly they're I mean especially like

2442
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
One of them is just basically a fancy slot machine

2443
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Which brings nothing new to the table

2444
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
The other one is kind of like a weird version of roulette

2445
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
The pyramid game was interesting

2446
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
But it didn't hold my attention for long enough

2447
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Honestly

2448
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I think a lot of people were just getting it to exploit the hell out of it

2449
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
For when the game actually comes out

2450
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
But I don't know what do you guys think in chat

2451
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Do you think it was intentional the whole time

2452
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
That they intended to have an exploit in there

2453
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I mean it does definitely kind of tie into the whole good versus evil thing

2454
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Yeah but it also makes it sound like he's

2455
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
He likes to sound like a smarty pants

2456
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And just you know trying to

2457
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Oh I did all this stuff

2458
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Because I think outside the box

2459
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I think greater than all this

2460
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I don't think he thought anything

2461
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I think it's just a glitch

2462
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
That now they're patching in some sort of

2463
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Reprecussion if you try it

2464
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
So whatever

2465
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Big freaking whoop

2466
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Well who knows if we'll get a new Fable game next year

2467
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
But one game we'll probably get next year

2468
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Is a brand new James Bond game

2469
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Right Activision has said that they are planning to put out

2470
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Yearly Bond games

2471
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Even though the movies only seem to come out every other year

2472
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
They're going to actually be trying to crank out

2473
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Yearly Bond titles

2474
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Of course right now the game they're trying to put out is Quantum of Solus

2475
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's actually based on the Call of Duty 4 engine

2476
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And you know obviously the movie tie in

2477
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
They've got this year

2478
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
But they may do these games even if there is no movie

2479
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
To go off of

2480
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
They haven't mentioned what the genre will be

2481
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
They haven't mentioned who's going to develop them

2482
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
What systems are going to be made for

2483
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
They're going to be aggressive in milking this James Bond franchise

2484
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
For all it's worth

2485
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
And frankly I don't really blame them

2486
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
People everywhere love their James Bond

2487
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's not surprising at all

2488
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
They're going to try to milk this franchise

2489
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
And let's face it you know one of the greatest video games

2490
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
On the Nintendo 64 ever

2491
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Was the James Bond game

2492
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
GoldenEye

2493
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
That game made me so sick

2494
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
But you know sometimes

2495
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I know there was a James Bond game I played

2496
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
That wasn't necessarily based off a movie

2497
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
But there have been a few

2498
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Not that they've been wonderful

2499
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
But who knows we'll see what happens

2500
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Anyway just really quickly I wanted to go over some of the responses

2501
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Was the pub games intentional or not?

2502
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
James Patrick says

2503
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Peter M. isn't a typical guy

2504
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I think it could very well be intentional

2505
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Game Guru says

2506
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
They should keep the cheat in

2507
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
But have it make you more evil

2508
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
So that yeah you can cheat but it's an evil act

2509
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Oh interesting

2510
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
So we'll see what happens

2511
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
So

2512
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
If you want to comment on our stories

2513
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com

2514
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
We want comments

2515
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Well this actually is good news for our European listeners

2516
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Or anybody listening or not

2517
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
But we hope you're listening

2518
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Actually the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut

2519
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
On the 19th of September

2520
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
The 360 arcade

2521
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Is going to

2522
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
129 pounds

2523
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Excuse me

2524
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
The 60 gigabyte pro

2525
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Is going to 169

2526
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And the 120 gigabyte elite

2527
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Is 229 pounds

2528
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
So good news

2529
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Yay cheaper things

2530
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
And I'm glad you know because Europe

2531
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Sometimes gets the shaft in a lot of our news stories

2532
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So it's nice to hear them getting a break once in a while

2533
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
It's just too bad they didn't get it the same time

2534
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
We did but hey better late than never

2535
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Right?

2536
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
There's a big old rumor coming out about

2537
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Project Gotham 5 saying now that

2538
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's being developed by the Forza

2539
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Development team

2540
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And that there could be an announcement for it

2541
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Next week

2542
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
According to a website called Addict

2543
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Gaming

2544
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
They have a reliable source

2545
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
That the game

2546
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Will be unveiled next week

2547
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And also mentions

2548
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
That this may be

2549
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
This is supposed to take place during the new

2550
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Xbox experience announcement

2551
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Scheduled for next week which a lot of people have already

2552
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Debunked as being false

2553
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
There could be this like 5 hour long

2554
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Thing on G4

2555
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I mean granted I can see how they could do that

2556
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Since there's nothing really plain on G4 except

2557
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Reruns of cops and cheaters

2558
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Haven't we already had a rumor about a G4 marathon

2559
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Of something that got debunked?

2560
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
This is the same thing but this is saying that

2561
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
This is going to be part of that announcement

2562
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
So it could all be bullshit or you know

2563
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Heaven forbid

2564
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Microsoft and G4 could have been

2565
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Lying to us and it's actually going to happen

2566
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I mean but you know

2567
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Once again we'll see you next week

2568
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You know what don't you think

2569
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I don't know if I were G4 television and I had a big

2570
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Exclusive thing that I was going to be dedicating

2571
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You know 5 hours of programming to

2572
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Don't you think I would have started advertising it like 6 weeks ago?

2573
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
No because if they want to be a surprise

2574
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Then this was the agreement with Microsoft

2575
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
To keep it hush hush super secret

2576
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Until the very end you know

2577
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
What's the point of a surprise?

2578
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I don't know I don't know

2579
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I'm just saying it's bullshit that's all

2580
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
All I'm saying there's other stuff happening

2581
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And that may be completely bullshit

2582
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But there are other things

2583
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Including I think a story that didn't make

2584
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
It was in show roll but didn't make

2585
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Our show roll

2586
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
About how they had

2587
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
That new Halo game or whatever

2588
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Is being teased on Bungie's site

2589
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And that there's an announcement

2590
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Coming soon maybe this announcement

2591
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Could come at the same time just saying

2592
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
There's kind of smoke here

2593
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
That maybe they're going to announce something soon

2594
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
About something so

2595
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
It's still I don't believe they're going to do

2596
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
A 5 hour long thing on G4 but who knows

2597
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Maybe there's something

2598
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Somewhere in the middle ground that's coming

2599
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Just saying cause you know all those Microsoft rumors

2600
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
You know they always seem to come true somehow

2601
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So I don't know

2602
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Well some people are very excited about this rumor

2603
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Acteft in chat says Project Gotham Racing 5

2604
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Developed by the Forza team do want

2605
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Could be very interesting

2606
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I'm kind of I want to see

2607
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
You know what I'm actually more excited about

2608
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
As sad as this is

2609
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
What game Blizzard

2610
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Not Blizzard

2611
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
What game Bazaar is developing

2612
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
With Blizzard, Activision

2613
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You know that whole thing

2614
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I'm curious what the new thing is they're making

2615
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And I'm hoping you know I'm not as into the Project Gotham

2616
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And Forza games as much as I am

2617
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
The more simple racing games so to speak

2618
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
You know I'm not like super into cars

2619
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
But I like the more need for speed burnout type games

2620
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
But I love

2621
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Dumb simple like dumb dumb dumb

2622
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Simple racing games like F-Zero and Mario Kart

2623
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And I would love it if they would make

2624
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
A next gen like dumb racing game

2625
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
That's like F-Zero

2626
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I really want like a next gen F-Zero game

2627
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Can't you tell how many times have I said it on the show

2628
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I wish that would be what

2629
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
They'd announce at Nintendo's press events

2630
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Coming up, wouldn't that be nice

2631
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Well meanwhile there are other games you can play

2632
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
One of them is Grid

2633
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
It's a game I didn't particularly care for it

2634
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
But hey I do like I do support when games

2635
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Further extend the life

2636
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
With some extra content and Grid is going to be

2637
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Extending its life with some new cars

2638
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And some new events

2639
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And some new download content that's coming out

2640
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
It's called the 8 Ball Pack

2641
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
It's supposed to be coming out this fall

2642
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
There's going to be two brand new multiplayer things

2643
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
And eight new cars, hence the name of the 8 Ball Pack

2644
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
A McLaren F1 GTR

2645
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
A Honda S2000

2646
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
A 1971 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am

2647
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Are some of the new things you can look for

2648
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
The expansion will be released for the Xbox 360

2649
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
And Playstation 3

2650
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's going to also bring some new achievements

2651
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Four new achievements, 100 gamer score

2652
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Of course on the Playstation 3 that would be trophies

2653
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
So there's also going to be some new multiplayer events as well

2654
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
It's pretty cool

2655
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Not quite specific on what the price is going to be for this

2656
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Or what the exact release date is

2657
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
But just plan on it soon

2658
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
As in this fall

2659
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
If you're a Grid player

2660
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Well something else that's coming soon

2661
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Is the Playstation firmware 2.5

2662
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
That's going to be likely later October

2663
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And supposedly simultaneously with that

2664
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
It will be the release of Home 1.0

2665
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
So finally the beta will be over

2666
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And you'll actually be able to participate in it

2667
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And it says they're waiting for a system software update

2668
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
To the PS3 to deal with this

2669
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I guess some sporadic network issues

2670
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
That they have with Home right now

2671
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And then they're going to

2672
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Reopen it sometime

2673
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I guess this week for thousands of new testers

2674
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
But in October is when they're supposed to bite the bullet

2675
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,000
And actually launch this thing that they've been teasing for a long time now

2676
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Wouldn't it be funny if they just came out in October and go

2677
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Yeah it's coming out spring of 2009

2678
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I'd laugh

2679
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Haven't they guaranteed that it's coming out this year?

2680
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
It doesn't matter. They guaranteed that the Playstation 3 was coming out in the spring

2681
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And ended up getting delayed through the fall

2682
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So nothing's guaranteed

2683
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Fair enough

2684
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Are you looking forward to trying out Home?

2685
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
No I don't really care

2686
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
You don't really care?

2687
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I'll test it out

2688
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I'm excited about Home. I'll have PS3

2689
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
I honestly don't think it's going to be that great

2690
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I think it's just going to be kind of eh

2691
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Look at what we can do. We're different

2692
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I mean great. It's a way to differentiate themselves

2693
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
We'll see how they actually use it

2694
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Alright

2695
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Well hey, you know what's kind of funny we're talking about

2696
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
We're just joking around in chat right now

2697
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And people were talking about racing games

2698
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
And AlphaCananagram said there is a next gen racing game

2699
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
It's called Crazy Woman Driver

2700
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Also known as Excite Truck

2701
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
And I was kind of like, they should make a game called Crazy Woman Driver

2702
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
But it should be like, not really

2703
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I'm not trying to say that with malice

2704
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Obviously I don't think all women are crazy drivers

2705
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
But I think there should be a game based around

2706
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Crazy Women Driving

2707
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
So then we get the sequel Small Penis Trucking

2708
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Sure

2709
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Sure fine by me

2710
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
We can have Small Penis Trucking

2711
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Fair enough. Fair is fair

2712
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
We can have both

2713
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Or how about this

2714
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Great Big Rims

2715
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Itty Bitty Penis

2716
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
That could be a sequel

2717
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Would that work for you? I don't know

2718
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Anyhow

2719
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
The reason why I'm saying that is

2720
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I'm tying this into a story about

2721
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
The Power

2722
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Because the Tyra Banks show

2723
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
This is a show that airs during the day

2724
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And actually I have to admit

2725
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I kind of like the Tyra Banks show

2726
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Because in one of those cheesy

2727
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Over the top type of ways

2728
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Tyra Banks is a very cheesy over the top host

2729
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Well do you remember the Wii Fit Girl?

2730
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I mean how can you forget her right?

2731
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
She was the one on YouTube

2732
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
That her boyfriend taped her

2733
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Doing the whole hula hooping thing

2734
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Obviously showing off her assets

2735
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
And it was very controversial

2736
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Well Tyra Banks had that couple on the show

2737
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
And apparently

2738
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Tyra

2739
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Helped this girl kind of get

2740
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Her revenge on the guy

2741
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And the guy was actually

2742
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
The boyfriend was on the show playing

2743
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And

2744
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
He actually had to take

2745
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
His pants off

2746
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
And play Wii Fit

2747
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
In his undies to be a delight of the audience

2748
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And that was actually the

2749
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Audience clapping along there

2750
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
And apparently that was done during a commercial break

2751
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Or something and released as a viral video

2752
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
And in

2753
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Retrospect it's kind of stupid I mean this story

2754
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Is like how old like two months old

2755
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Listen Tyra Banks is trying to be

2756
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Edgy and trying to be all like

2757
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
She's edgy like 90 days late

2758
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
The only

2759
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Time I ever hear about the Tyra Banks show is when I'm

2760
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Watching the soup because they make fun

2761
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Of her because she's retarded

2762
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And I don't know

2763
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
But she also was she did something

2764
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Way back with like World of Warcraft

2765
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Where they destroyed some dudes CDs

2766
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Or something like that

2767
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Yeah you installed the game you dipshit

2768
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
You know I actually walked by at work

2769
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
And I saw that Tyra

2770
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Was on because they have a TV at work and you know

2771
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
They have different channels on during the day and I saw that the Tyra Banks

2772
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Show was on and I actually

2773
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Kind of looked up and I noticed they were showing

2774
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
The YouTube of the Wii Fit girl

2775
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
She was getting ready to introduce her and I was kind of looking

2776
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
At it going this must be a rerun

2777
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
This is like 90 days old

2778
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
No it wasn't it was

2779
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
It was a brand new episode

2780
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Too little too late

2781
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Too little too late so you know

2782
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Late stories I don't know about you

2783
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Guys but they make me a little bit angsty

2784
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So this is when we get into the FUs of the week

2785
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
My FU of the week was towards

2786
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
My sinuses my allergies

2787
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
My lungs and lots and lots of mucus

2788
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I miss having a voice

2789
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I miss having to eat or drink something hot

2790
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Just to be perfectly audible

2791
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
And um Rob

2792
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

2793
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
That's the only cool part of it

2794
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Old joke is old

2795
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Alright Loki

2796
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Um I guess

2797
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
My FU of the week goes to the fact

2798
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
That I have to wake up early tomorrow

2799
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Because I have to take my wife's car in

2800
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Apparently she was driving down the street

2801
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Or whatever um doing 50

2802
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,920
year or something and then the car like all sudden stopped accelerating and the

2803
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:40,400
check engine light came on then it started accelerating again so that's

2804
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:49,160
usually not a good thing so yeah I hate waking up really um my a few of the week

2805
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,880
goes to something I've been spending a lot of time on lately and my a few of

2806
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,840
the week goes to Proposition 8 I don't usually get very politically motivated

2807
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:00,920
on the show but amen seeing as this is something that directly affects my

2808
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:04,760
rights and you know we've done this show for free for how long pardon me while I

2809
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:08,680
get on my soapbox for a minute if you live in California even if you don't

2810
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:11,840
live in California please tell people that you know that live in California to

2811
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,480
vote no on Proposition 8 and Proposition 8 is basically an initiative on the

2812
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,760
ballot that's looking to ban same-sex marriage which is already legal in

2813
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:24,360
California thanks just a court decision a few months ago and I believe in

2814
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:28,720
equality and fairness for all and you know despite however a person might feel

2815
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:33,560
about gay marriage personally it's not gonna hurt you if two guys or two women

2816
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:37,160
get married and you know go on with their lives and raise a family and I

2817
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:41,440
think it's just I think the whole thing is so stupid and I can't believe that

2818
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:45,400
people pour millions and millions of dollars into what I basically see as in

2819
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:50,080
this opinion hate when I see people donating money to this yes on a campaign

2820
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,920
I see hate because that's what it is a discrimination of the 21st century and

2821
01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:00,920
it stinks ignorance it's just ignorance it's ignorant I mean I know I know I

2822
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:04,440
could go on for days no no I fully agree with you it's absolutely disgusting I

2823
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:10,080
mean honestly I would love to see marriage made illegal to begin with no

2824
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:17,920
no no I understand be strictly reduced to a religious institution separation of

2825
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,600
church and state have that wall that you know Jefferson intended when he wrote

2826
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:27,000
the damn phrase right now and have the government should anyone would think

2827
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,280
that the government wouldn't love for there to be more married people it's it's

2828
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:36,320
good for the economy tax taxes and think of other wedding money that goes in the

2829
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,260
economy but anyway anyway look I could go on for days and days it's a video

2830
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:44,000
game show I don't want to but you know just please you know this is gonna set a

2831
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
precedent for the nation here and you know it's very very important that we

2832
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,360
defeat proposition 8 on the ballot it just it pisses me off that they lie they

2833
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:56,880
freaking lie when they call people they say that if this proposition is defeated

2834
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,920
the churches are going to be forced to marry that Mormon churches the church

2835
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:04,520
that don't want to do are going to be forced to marry that is not true it's

2836
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:08,360
straight-up not true look like the Catholic Church actually they're very

2837
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:12,960
strict they can and can't marry because they have both have to be Catholic as

2838
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,040
far as I'm aware and all this other stuff is no you're absolutely right I

2839
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:22,600
think it's stupid and ridiculous and those should dedicate a podcast just to

2840
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:26,040
it oh god oh I could just go on for days and days days anyway you know what for

2841
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:30,360
those folks to think that you know gay marriage is gonna ruin the sanctity of

2842
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:36,280
marriage I've got three words for you Britney fucking Spears all right back to

2843
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:42,280
video games hug hug kiss kiss I love everybody I really all right Britney

2844
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:49,520
fucking Spears that's awesome you know what what that's another pocket we need

2845
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:53,680
to do a political podcast someday you know I actually actually and I will go

2846
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:57,840
ahead and say this on the air you know cuz you know me I'm very opinionated

2847
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:07,600
about my ideas you know Rob I'm just messing but maybe maybe we should do

2848
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:12,680
some type of a new sub podcast a political can we should do something

2849
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:16,760
called I don't know if Loki's down with it I just like to pissed off nerds I

2850
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:22,320
should call the show to pissed off huh I joined the ECA yeah there you get lots

2851
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:26,520
of information from them why not maybe you know it's about time people put

2852
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,640
their foot down and said screw you guys I'm going belly know what I'm pissed off

2853
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:35,240
that podcast is limiting my bandwidth to 250 gigabytes a month you know what that

2854
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:37,920
is something else to get pissed off that's a different political thing but

2855
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,960
yeah that is angry I like that idea to pissed off nerds we'll see if there's

2856
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:49,000
already a pot there's got to be I'm sure there's one called angry that's 62,500

2857
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:54,040
songs at four megabytes per song that that's basically our 125 standard

2858
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:59,800
definition movies well you know what I download that much actually I don't but

2859
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:05,920
I do monitor my downloading now gs68 says pissed off nerds wouldn't that be

2860
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,800
under sedation life that's a good point they might already have a corner on that

2861
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,320
mark they also have an angry video game nerd who's kind of retarded he's awesome

2862
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:17,360
that's different though because that's actually about video games awesome any

2863
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:21,360
place he plays the games and talk shit about them and they usually are shitty

2864
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:26,800
games I'm I don't know what I'm not gonna say my show Nintendo nerd didn't

2865
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:30,480
begin the angry video game I'm a fan of independent productions we'll just leave

2866
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:34,800
it up but let's do it well so we'll look into it when two twin powers activate

2867
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,880
will love a bucket explore the possibilities all right video games hey

2868
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:44,840
damn it guess what's coming out a virtual console overseas they're getting

2869
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:51,680
the master system Sonic the Hedgehog isn't that pretty cool and then some

2870
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:57,800
Commodore 64 games Rob Boulder dash do Boulder dash is awesome and guess what

2871
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,240
there was like a million of those Boulder dash games I know what else

2872
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:06,840
jump man cool jump man I'd love jump man why are we getting these over here I

2873
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:11,560
played jump man standards I think they had it over here our jump man jump man

2874
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,360
generous no I don't I know we had those I had jump man junior was the first game

2875
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,880
I ever owned on my Commodore 64 well jump man if I'm if I'm right this is the

2876
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:24,680
jump man that led to us getting Donkey Kong wasn't in a way yeah I mean it's

2877
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:29,400
very similar the way they were laid out but the first hero in Donkey Kong was

2878
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:33,800
called jump man before he became Mario remember yeah but it's not I mean the

2879
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:38,040
games aren't related but I mean the but well they're they're not related in

2880
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:42,560
design but they're related in the fact that they kind of are similar with the

2881
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,320
ladders checks and ladders type of gameplay I always thought that they were

2882
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:50,360
related but oh well I just beat me no different design companies one was

2883
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:55,280
Japanese one was American yeah um this one says it was a pixie they did um

2884
01:42:55,280 --> 01:43:01,920
mousetrap didn't they uh yeah they did mouse trap I love that they did but I

2885
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:05,440
thought epics did jump but then they did jump in junior um it is epic someone was

2886
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:09,360
reading it wrong yeah dead epics did like summer games and winter games it had

2887
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:15,960
a lot of great great games on clique of vision that's what I played it on is the

2888
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:19,920
clique of vision yeah I got to play a little bit here of just some of this

2889
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,040
stuff from jump man jr.

2890
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:30,400
I know it's jumping jr. not jump man but it's the same same same freaking thing

2891
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:35,480
I remember setting it up to go really fast funny yeah you could set your speed

2892
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:38,360
in this game that was the amazing thing about it is that like you could have the

2893
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:43,680
speed be so freaky fast it was like unreal

2894
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:48,160
so where's some actual gameplay noise I love that game oh this game was so

2895
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:54,600
amazing sorry we're living in a little dot oh yes you have to avoid that killer

2896
01:43:54,600 --> 01:44:02,640
dot anyway sorry okay we're done reminiscing uh me too I don't know that

2897
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:07,280
was it that was a good virtual console update well it's not fair that they get

2898
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,520
it there we don't get it I know even though I'm on my little boy I might

2899
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:15,600
break my boycott for jump man honestly that's awesome I think that we will

2900
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:22,040
though you know I think the tiger class said what the fuck is that sound it

2901
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:27,160
sounds like someone jacking off at warp speed it was the sound of him running

2902
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:31,120
you have to see that go go YouTube jump man jr. you'll see it funny or what's

2903
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:38,600
faster it is it's super slow too you can choose the pace that you want to jack

2904
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:51,480
off at a medium pace yeah anyhow oh yes we can only make that you know

2905
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:57,960
transition from virtual console the porn anyways so from jacking off to

2906
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:06,400
PlayStation 3 news yeah exactly Oh Sony how you make the funnies I seriously

2907
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:10,760
wonder if they're trying this on purpose now but apparently the Sony PlayStation

2908
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:18,840
3 just launched into the Malaysia region and during their little party that they

2909
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:24,520
were you know talking about you know how great Sony is and stuff like that they

2910
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:31,720
were introducing different speakers and stuff including one of which is now a

2911
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:37,160
pseudo the managing director of Sony Malaysia and he was taken to the stage

2912
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:43,400
with a very familiar not Sony related video game theme and it's absolutely

2913
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:48,240
hilarious because they were playing the Legend of Zelda theme for him walking up

2914
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:56,920
to the stage wow how did they not catch that I don't know but of course someone

2915
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:02,560
just get the wrong CD in the mixer maybe that's a really wrong CD wrong platform

2916
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,920
only that's something you shouldn't have even been in the building right exactly

2917
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:10,360
so that was kind of funny they have the video on YouTube you know definitely

2918
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:17,720
check it out because it's pretty funny so that is it and of course Kotaku ran

2919
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:22,040
the story the or one of the stories is that even the Imperial March would have

2920
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:28,440
been a better choice all right well every week on this program we like to

2921
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:32,360
give you a chance to give us some feedback not just through the chat room

2922
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:35,720
at chat.org.com or the phone calls which we'll get to later but through our mail

2923
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:39,000
bag and every week you guys send us emails and we pick a few of them to read

2924
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,040
on the show or in tonight's case we're probably gonna read a lot of them on the

2925
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:50,600
show tonight actually it's a statement we call the OLR mailbag

2926
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:55,360
wrong thing I know but I felt like singing anyway by the way I know I still

2927
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:00,800
do that when I hear it I still hear it in my head. You've ruined me Rob, you've ruined me.

2928
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,080
usually dark soccer reads the emails but as you know she's a little bit under the

2929
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:08,440
weather tonight thanks to stuff in the air so I will be taking over since my

2930
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:11,960
voice seems to be in good shape even though I was shouting most of the day

2931
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:16,880
gay or straight no on eight anyway moving on we're gonna start off with an

2932
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:21,800
email from Robway it's Rob with two B's I just got infinite undiscovery I noticed

2933
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,520
the action RPG fights a lot like say Kingdom Hearts could this be an initial

2934
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:33,040
run with a new RPG engine any thoughts hmm interesting theory but would Kingdom

2935
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:36,720
Hearts be on the 360 I don't think so an infinite of discovery I think is a 360

2936
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:40,880
exclusive but it would be a killer exclusive but I think most people have

2937
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,680
kind of already chalked up the fact that in the rumors are saying the Kingdom

2938
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:47,040
Hearts is gonna be on the 360 but if you remember they don't be on PlayStation

2939
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:50,320
3 if you remember they develop all their games on PC so it wouldn't matter

2940
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:54,360
anyway true so you know yeah absolutely it could be a cross-platform thing but

2941
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:58,520
just something to think about by the way he also wants to add a PS if you haven't

2942
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:02,920
yet played the game early on in the game is a village called new land this is

2943
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:06,640
spoiler free don't worry in order to ensure you don't have to restart the

2944
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:11,600
game save the game as soon as you find the save point do not overwrite that

2945
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:16,440
save until you have completed the task they're a tip from Rob with two B's that

2946
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:20,960
might save some of you guys some headaches we have another question here

2947
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:25,920
this individual did not sign their email but I think it's spasnator because I see

2948
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,480
it in the email address even though I'm not gonna give the whole email address

2949
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,740
but we'll just say that hi folks I have some questions for you again I hope you

2950
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:35,120
don't mind that most of them are of a semi quasi political in nature hey no

2951
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:38,800
that's okay we're kind of on a political tangent tonight one given that we're

2952
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,080
experiencing all this economic turmoil do you see this affecting the video game

2953
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:46,340
industry in any way shape or form what do you guys think with the reset with

2954
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:51,440
the current economy situation affect the video game industry well it's a lot of

2955
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:57,480
banks that are going poor so it's not like I mean people really aren't seeing

2956
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:00,440
a lot of people becoming poor because of the situation that's going on right now

2957
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:05,720
unless I guess you're you own a bank and in which case you probably before but no

2958
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:10,040
I don't think it's gonna affect anything if this continues on for a few years or

2959
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:13,360
something like that then yeah it's gonna be bad and probably people will be more

2960
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:18,400
conservative with their game spending so they won't buy as much in my opinion and

2961
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:22,560
this is only the dumbest answer in some ways yes in some ways no yes because

2962
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,040
people have less disposable income and video games are funded by disposable

2963
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:30,400
income but no because video games are a global market not just made for the US

2964
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:33,200
so I don't think they're necessarily gonna stop developing games because they

2965
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,800
still sell in Japan they still sell in Europe and other countries and it might

2966
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:39,120
not be experiencing the same thing we're experiencing so something to think about

2967
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:42,680
number two with the election coming up not too long from now and given the fact

2968
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:47,000
that both Obama and McCain are in a virtual tie currently in polls do you

2969
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,600
think either one of them will reach out to gamers seeing as a good chunk of the

2970
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:55,200
population or gamers most of which are old enough to vote honestly you want my

2971
01:49:55,200 --> 01:50:00,840
honest answer no because unfortunately there's still that stigma in the the

2972
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:04,440
place out there and I'm not reading from the email this is my off the top of my

2973
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:09,300
head I say no because there's still a big negative aura that goes with video

2974
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:13,800
games thanks to people like Jack Voldemort and people that you know video

2975
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:17,280
games are bad and bloody and violent and you know it's that old mentality that

2976
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:21,040
Dungeons & Dragons makes people kill people in real life unfortunately that's

2977
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:24,600
still around so unfortunately I don't think you're ever gonna see Obama McCain

2978
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:29,120
siding with the gamers in that respect because I think it would for them sadly

2979
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:33,960
would do more harm than good and it's sad don't get me wrong but that's why

2980
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:37,680
it's important that gamers you know that's why things like ECA and so on are

2981
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:42,120
important because gamers get a voice then gamers get their political clout

2982
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:47,480
known etc etc this one isn't so much a question back to the email as it is a

2983
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:50,540
random idea or thought I had and would like to have you guys be my sounding

2984
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:53,560
board do you think it may be a decent idea if sometime down the road there was

2985
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:57,400
a political post either on a volunteer basis or salaried that had two functions

2986
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,960
advise the president on all things video game entertainment related and also did

2987
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,920
some public education on video games basically dispelling myths

2988
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:07,800
misconceptions stereotypes and anything Jack douchebag says about video games I

2989
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:11,240
was thinking that if something like this was in place perhaps things will

2990
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:16,120
eventually simmer down something like it is in place it's called the ECA it's

2991
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:19,920
just not officially government sanctioned but that's you know you're on

2992
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,560
the right track with what you're thinking about but again for the same

2993
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,560
reasons I stated before you're not going to see the government just start to

2994
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:29,520
embrace video games like that you know what I mean but I think what you're

2995
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,480
talking about that's the type of thing that the ECA is looking to bring

2996
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:37,600
awareness to so check it out if you haven't already because I think they're

2997
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:44,080
looking for politically minded people like you agree disagree I think so all

2998
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:49,360
right that was and I think so all right moving on to the next email this is from

2999
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:56,440
I am a B hi olr I was wondering if you guys are still going to do pyramid head

3000
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:00,520
rape appreciation day and if so when is it anyways keep up the great work and I

3001
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:04,000
hope to see you guys in future cons you know I'm afraid we may have missed it I

3002
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,920
forgot completely about it we haven't missed the other game hasn't come out

3003
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:09,920
yet it's moved so I thought it was supposed to be the day after Silent Hill

3004
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:15,240
2's release no I think we were doing this just to make it easy the release of

3005
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:18,600
Silent Hill homecoming doesn't homecoming come out in like two weeks

3006
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:21,960
yeah it's on the 30th see I always thought oh it's it's almost around that

3007
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:26,640
same time anyway because September 25th so that would be like in four days what

3008
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:30,520
is it yeah it's like the day no I'm sorry September 24th the Wednesday so

3009
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:33,600
her 24th was the day that it was originally released on the PlayStation

3010
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:38,080
2 in 2001 I just I don't know if it would be yeah just do it on the 30th it

3011
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:43,680
makes it easy or for Halloween you know I don't think we have any officially run

3012
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:48,580
events this year but I think what you should do you should if it's go see

3013
01:52:48,580 --> 01:52:52,160
the hard thing is I don't want to say run out by Silent Hill homecoming

3014
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:56,080
because I don't know it might suck so what you should do is play a Silent Hill

3015
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:59,800
game yeah play a Silent Hill game like Silent Hill 2 that's really good and

3016
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:03,120
then wait for our review I'm after the game comes out and if it's good you'll

3017
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:06,720
buy that too and that's how you can praise pyramid head but if you do want

3018
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:10,320
to take little pictures of pyramid heads and send them in to us or creative

3019
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:15,240
pyramid head usage in public then I would love to run them on the front page

3020
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:20,160
of our site I think that would be fun so maybe just kind of like a general end of

3021
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:25,520
September time frame I don't know about having a rape appreciation day people

3022
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:30,120
would like that too much but the only rape of monsters remember not rape of

3023
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:42,640
humans all right let's go on to another email that comes from see it's not

01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:11,960
gamer tags sadly my friends list is full but if you send me a really nice message

3031
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,880
I'll usually try to find somebody on there who hasn't signed in xbox live in

3032
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,640
like 30 days and delete them to make room for new listeners or just somebody

3033
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:24,280
who I've never exchanged a message with or anything so yeah send me a message if

3034
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:27,200
you want but instead of giving you the gamer tags out over the air we're gonna

3035
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:31,600
make it work for it so I head on over the forums and check that out or listen

3036
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:37,280
to a previous episode where we did give give it out I think there was one other

3037
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:40,720
email I wanted to read here and we're not gonna be able to get to all the

3038
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,000
emails this week but I think we'll read this one and this will be the last one

3039
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,200
tonight and it comes to us from Dan shadow hey guys Dan shadow here hope you

3040
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:51,880
all had a great talk like a pirate day this last Friday I had my fair share of

3041
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:57,440
grog I can tell you that hmm talk like a pirate day did you guys do anything to

3042
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:02,920
celebrate I said our once I didn't are like a pirate you acted like one though

3043
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:08,240
yeah I think I posted on my Twitter hey zero day leet where's coming to my site

3044
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:14,440
check it out dudes that was my talk like a pirate thing some some things have

3045
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:17,880
been on my mind lately it seems the only way developers can move forward is to

3046
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:22,000
move laterally we have been seeing games adopt aspects of other genres to fix

3047
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,320
some of their problems this has been incredibly popular so far look at look

3048
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:29,000
Grand Theft Auto for instance when this game was went 3d all they did was to

3049
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,800
take a crappy driving game with a crappy shooter put you in the big world to play

3050
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,440
in it seems to me that if there's an abundance of things to do people will

3051
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:41,560
overlook the quality of the gameplay retort not necessarily I think the

3052
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:45,360
driving is good in it and it's not really a crappy game now however they're

3053
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,880
crappy minigames that they threw in there like crappy bowling crappy darts

3054
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:54,680
and crappy billiards yes that does suck and that does feel very tacked on and

3055
01:55:54,680 --> 01:56:01,760
this crappy but the game itself fun do you think that it's a so you don't think

3056
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,560
it's a crappy shooter and crapping driving game kind of no not all I think

3057
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,760
they I mean having played some of the other multiplayer Grand Theft Auto games

3058
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:12,520
which were only on PSP unfortunately they fixed a lot of things there's a lot

3059
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:17,160
of things they haven't fixed but you know they each have their own little

3060
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:22,160
nuances my problem with Grand Theft Auto is now that I've finished the game

3061
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:26,560
unless I play multiplayer there's not much for me to do in it it's not really

3062
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:33,640
fun anymore there's not a lot of I don't know fun things to do in it I

3063
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:38,440
guess I have more to this email from Dan shadow I just wonder if the developers

3064
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:41,840
are having problems with moving a genre forward without having to distract the

3065
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,760
gamer with aspects of more popular games this work so far but I don't want to see

3066
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,960
RPG elements in every single game nor do I want to have a driver in my RPG on the

3067
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:53,320
surface you'll see big-time shooters that are hardcore on the surface once

3068
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:56,440
you go online you're riddled with customization experience points and

3069
01:56:56,440 --> 01:57:00,320
guild systems where do you think the genres are going do you think there's

3070
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:05,880
room for more than one great single genre game each year yes but you know

3071
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:09,760
what the problem is I think and thanks for your mouth I think a big prior the

3072
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,920
problem is that because of the way like Christmas is a lot of games get

3073
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:18,560
overlooked because they all come out between September to December I think

3074
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:21,760
more great games we get recognized if they would learn how to evenly space

3075
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,640
them out throughout the years starting to get that I I think a little bit yes

3076
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:29,240
but my god I feel overwhelmed right now with all the games I want to play I mean

3077
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:34,640
really the other thing too also is that I mean what they're trying to do is

3078
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:38,920
attract more people to their game and the problem is if they keep putting out

3079
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:42,480
the same game and not trying to incorporate these little elements that

3080
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:46,000
maybe will attract an RPG player or maybe we'll attract someone who's really

3081
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,920
into bowling or something that's really what they're trying to do to get they're

3082
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:54,560
kind of trying to branch out a little bit I think the real problem comes down

3083
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:59,440
to these companies but not games that aren't finished or aren't working

3084
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:04,880
correctly or haven't been properly bug tested or anything I mean seriously

3085
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:09,080
mercenaries to what the fuck that game is not done there is no way that they

3086
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:13,720
can say oh yeah we've ironed out all the bugs in that one no they did not in fact

3087
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:16,760
they probably will just look at it figure out what's wrong with it and then

3088
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:20,360
later on they can go patch it because it made better business sense for them at

3089
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:23,600
the time to release it when they did because there wasn't a lot coming out

3090
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:26,640
around then and they figure they're gonna get a lot more sales that way at

3091
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:31,200
the same time people say their game is shit interesting comment from Xenocore

3092
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:35,320
in our chat room the problem is the same reason we all have these big-budget games

3093
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:40,800
too many suits in the industry I'm kind of curious to see what XNA is gonna do

3094
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:43,360
to all this you know you know I keep talking about I really think this is

3095
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:46,120
gonna be a big freaking deal and I know I make a big deal about it on the show

3096
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:50,680
but come on I mean it is a distribution platform for independent games to really

3097
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:55,480
get noticed I'm very curious to see what this does to gaming if anything I could

3098
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:59,120
be wrong it could have the impact of just a little pebble I think if they do

3099
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:02,720
anything right they could be a big volcano too and I hate to say this like

3100
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:07,360
the Apple App Store where a lot of people putting stuff on there and it

3101
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:11,120
spreads like wildfire really quick and that's part of the reason why sorry

3102
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:15,960
Logie but the iPhone is murdering is because you don't see that type of in

3103
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:19,760
enabling on other phones that are out there like the instinct and all those

3104
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:23,280
other things you know I'm and I'm sure some angry emailer who's anti Apple and

3105
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,600
pro sprint or whatever's gonna email me telling me about things I'm not

3106
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:30,320
considering but whatever Apple's doing a great job marketing their marketplace

3107
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:33,920
and getting it out there that you know any idiot can make these applications

3108
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:37,240
that you know some of them are very exciting like you know the whole built

3109
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:43,280
in Twitter and you know just everything they've got it's great so that's part of

3110
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:47,320
why the iPhones kicking a lot of button why everybody really wants one well not

3111
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:50,240
everybody but a lot of people all right that was it for mailbag hey why don't

3112
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:53,200
you send us an email for consideration to be read up next week mailbag at

3113
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:56,760
orange laundry calm very sorry to those emails we didn't get to this week just

3114
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:00,320
realized we didn't run out of time but we did read them all and we lulled at

3115
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:03,840
your improper grammar just kidding but we also praised you when you had good

3116
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:09,560
grammar let's get back some gaming news Loki yes well the big trend now is to

3117
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:14,280
release movies based on games release talk about it so of course the next game

3118
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:19,320
that they're talking about making a movie for would be Mass Effect and

3119
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:27,680
apparently AV Arad I guess the guy behind a bunch of good comic book movie

3120
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:36,160
franchises is has been rumored to be or to have optioned the game for movie so

3121
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:41,320
we'll have to see if this actually ends up happening because you know like other

3122
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:50,800
games like Halo it doesn't end up coming out so yeah I think great let's see if

3123
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:54,960
there's a good quality movie made here but unfortunately so far track record

3124
02:00:54,960 --> 02:01:02,480
hasn't been too favorable I am I do have a little bit of I guess moderately high

3125
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:07,920
hopes for Max Payne because that looks kind of cool and hit man I guess wasn't

3126
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:14,360
that bad but I didn't see it so I can't really judge was not good well if one

3127
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:17,760
movie wasn't enough there's another movie coming out is coming out in Germany

3128
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:23,440
why Germany because that's right the man who brought you postal among with other

3129
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:28,400
great cinematic fair label has made a new movie it's called far cry yippie

3130
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:33,360
skippy and it's getting its German premiere on October 2nd so expect the

3131
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:40,520
first reviews to hit the internet around them I call it a far cry from good now

3132
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:45,040
now you can't hate it until you've seen it no I can hate it because it's doable

3133
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:51,400
or available and yes his track record speaks for himself I'm sorry I'm waiting

3134
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:56,200
for the fluke to happen where all sudden it's just cinematic you know mastery but

3135
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:00,800
it's not it's really not going to be good by the way I'm Tiger Claw reminds

3136
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:03,860
me of something I read on the internet this week he says oh speaking of label

3137
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:07,480
he's also coming out with his own video games you hear about that yeah tunnel

3138
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:11,840
rats when we interviewed him he actually talked about that a little bit I think

3139
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:16,680
it's supposed to come out like next year and they had a trailer for the game which

3140
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:22,360
looks okay I guess it looked kind of boring but the graphics were all right

3141
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:28,040
because if ruining one entertainment genre wasn't enough or Zach deft calls

3142
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:33,680
him way balls he really just he needs to find his niche that he's good at

3143
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:38,200
obviously games aren't it and he just really wants to use games because it's

3144
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:45,200
an excuse about meditating far away from here what's his name talking well he

3145
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:49,080
just wants to make genre films but it's like kind of like oh I just want to play

3146
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:52,740
around with making movies you know he's not even really that serious about it

3147
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:59,920
frisbee suggests in chat room the wonderfully mature name of boob way balls

3148
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:03,920
why not we give new people we give people new names on this show all the

3149
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:08,880
time maybe we should officially call him boo boy balls you know what what why do

3150
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:13,880
we give him press I don't know because sometimes you can't help it's like a

3151
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:18,280
train wreck you know you don't want to look but you can't help but turn your

3152
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:22,200
head and go because I wonder how bad it is because we have to warn people

3153
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:26,440
because there are some people that are like ooh Far Cry Far Cry video game

3154
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:32,720
movie you know sadly enough the thing is you know obviously we can't reach a lot

3155
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:36,320
of people but the people that listen to us can reach their friends and their

3156
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,760
friends will reach their friends and eventually more these movies will make

3157
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:43,920
it less into the theaters more direct-to-video and less people will buy

3158
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:49,240
them because unfortunately these sell like crazy on DVD and I don't know why

3159
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:52,200
because people apparently are stupid well people like their bad movie

3160
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:58,040
collection it's MST 3k syndrome right exactly it is I'm actually wanting to

3161
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:01,120
know if the any of those riff tracks have been done to a new a bowl film

3162
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:07,440
because I bet that would be funny anyway awesome moving on um for people who are

3163
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:13,200
Sega fans like myself there are actually going to be a new game coming out it's

3164
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:19,000
Harley Davidson king of the road and you know they did Harley Davidson in LA

3165
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:27,680
writers not too long ago well like ten years ago but now they're going to have

3166
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:35,720
it on a full-size Harley on a 62 inch screen and it's gonna have a very 70s

3167
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:43,320
rock soundtrack with Deep Purple and Steppin Wolf and it's on display it was

3168
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:49,720
on display the Tokyo amusement show so I want awesome

3169
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:54,760
very cool uh Harley games that could be kind of awesome it could also be kind of

3170
02:04:54,760 --> 02:05:01,840
bad but hopefully not yeah I was gonna say there was another arcade game that

3171
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:05,560
was supposed to be coming out that didn't make our show roll but uh

3172
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:11,720
elevator action was getting a new arcade game with an actual elevator door on the

3173
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:18,560
arcade cabinet nice and it's now a shooter game which is interesting so

3174
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:23,960
kind of cool anyways another thing that's getting changed a little bit is

3175
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:28,320
Animal Crossing for the Wii the name is actually changed a little bit in

3176
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:32,960
Australia for some reason apparently city folk is not welcome in Australia

3177
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:39,600
but let's go to the city is so Animal Crossing shall now be known as Animal

3178
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:47,040
Crossing let's go to the city in Australia make it so why I don't know

3179
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:51,720
that's the question of the day like is is I gotta know Australian folks is is

3180
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:55,760
fault did I just insult you by saying folk I mean that's what I want to know

3181
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:01,760
that's I'm very very curious about what is it so in insulting about city folk

3182
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:09,360
folk you rub I don't think that's it I don't know the other thing I was gonna

3183
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:12,360
say well I mean they've done this in the past with other games I mean another

3184
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:17,960
perfect example would be in the Asian region Africa is no longer known as

3185
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:23,360
Africa it's known as a kuna matata kuna matata I love it do we talk about that

3186
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:27,160
last week yes we did Oh God that's a great now see if they'd called the game

3187
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:32,440
that originally I would be all over that you know what I mean we wouldn't I was a

3188
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:36,440
game coming I'll call her kuna matata how wondering if they don't do that

3189
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:43,840
because Disney would be like you're sued yeah Disney will sue Xenocore says it's

3190
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:47,960
now known as Jumbo Safari that's why they're gonna sell more copies of it I

3191
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:52,480
wish I wish alright well one more story for you guys then we're gonna open up

3192
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:56,560
our skype line and you can call us at orange lounge radio on skype or our

3193
02:06:56,560 --> 02:07:00,400
phone number one eight seven seven game olr and this is a story about EA

3194
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:05,040
Microsoft and GameStop what did these three companies have in common well they

3195
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:10,160
were recently awarded perfect scores for the treatment of gay lesbian bisexual

3196
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:15,080
and transgender employees and that's by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and

3197
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:21,760
it's all in the 2009 corporate equity index here's a comment on this from game

3198
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:26,600
politics comm a comment from the president of the HRC Foundation Joel

3199
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:31,600
soul Moness the 2009 corporate equality index shows that corporate America

3200
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:35,400
understands that a diverse workforce is critical to remaining successful and

3201
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:38,360
competitive in the absence of a federal law that prohibits workplace

3202
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:41,360
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or

3203
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:45,400
expression it is up to employers to take the lead and implement policies that

3204
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:49,800
ensure all of their employees are protected game related companies which

3205
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:55,760
also receive perfect scores include retailers Best Buy and Target PC Dell HP

3206
02:07:55,760 --> 02:08:05,520
Intel eBay Google Yahoo and Apple so nice very nice you know it's it's kind

3207
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:09,240
of sad but you know you might be thinking well why is this news because

3208
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:13,680
sadly there are some companies out there where it's okay to discriminate based on

3209
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:18,840
that stuff and it's time to get out of your cave and really to be honest it's

3210
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:25,640
GameStop they just treat everyone like shit so but at least at least it's fair

3211
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:30,040
everybody is treated everybody is treated like shit so at least it's it's

3212
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:33,840
non-discriminatory that's the important thing and I'm fine with that as long as

3213
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:37,520
everybody's treated like shit all right anyway we're gonna treat you like shit

3214
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:41,880

3217
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:57,520
stories Loki yes I do have a few some stuff that I didn't make our show roll

3218
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:03,980
this week apparently there was a ISO loader being in development for the

3219
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:10,080
homebrew community much to the dislike of the homebrew community and the

3220
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:17,080
developer when it cocoa apparently it got leaked out which is not good and now

3221
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:21,160
the developer said you didn't get the full version then so fuck you all

3222
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:23,960
yikes alright let's go to the phone real quick we'll come back to the story how

3223
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:27,720
you're on orange on radio is this you know what up guys it's in a corporate

3224
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:28,520
quest

3225
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:33,000
hey Zina core from ultimate quest what is on your mind my friend a few things

3226
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,880
first of all ducked a new Knight Rider for public safety type thing you know

3227
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:41,040
that get that get that get that did that premiere tonight or something

3228
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:45,440
no but I caught it on Hulu and that's it's like how many sharks can you jump

3229
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:52,840
in one show my god record or something it doesn't know how to do the show no

3230
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:56,720
hassle Hoff equals instant fail I mean it doesn't take a genius to recognize

3231
02:09:56,720 --> 02:10:02,480
that the only cool thing I liked in there was even though I dislike the

3232
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:06,200
whole mission support type thing going on the one Asian chick in there that

3233
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:09,920
speaks my languages that's always throwing off one-liners is hilarious but

3234
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:13,240
other than that that shows garbage potential for a good video game out of

3235
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:17,880
the new Knight Rider series hell no too many effects they put ground effects on

3236
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:21,560
kit for crying out loud he jumped over guys and there's shit glowing on the

3237
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:24,960
bottom that said kr it's like what this thing run through the hood hood or

3238
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:29,800
something get some rims like I missed spinning like good lord how much crap

3239
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:34,280
can you bolt on him I mean and he transformed into an f-150 of all things

3240
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:37,120
my god I got so much hate for the show all right well look I know you didn't

3241
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:40,040
call in just to bash on Knight Rider what what's going on here what what

3242
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:48,880
actually what from what I've seen of the new Knight Rider show I thought the

3243
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:53,240
little of you know TV movie that they did that kind of like pilot the thing I

3244
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:57,320
thought it was pretty good I mean I don't know all right look I did have

3245
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:01,760
hope until I saw episode one okay like no spirit unless the hoffs involved I'm

3246
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:04,800
not watching it anywhere but anyway I don't even talk just about Knight Rider

3247
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:09,080
what's on the gaming world all right Rob have you played Warhammer online yet I

3248
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:11,720
have I I don't know I think you came into the show late tonight but I talked

3249
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:15,960
about during my gaming week in part a hmm yeah I kind of missed that I was

3250
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:19,200
busy with some stuff no that's right yeah I'm like so far man what do you

3251
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:22,120
what do you do you like it now here's my thing I had some likes I had some

3252
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:25,280
dislikes I liked some of the new things that Warhammer brought to the table

3253
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:29,200
especially in the PvP area like I really liked some of the RVR combat that I

3254
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:32,320
played I thought some of the scenarios are pretty awesome and I like the idea

3255
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:36,720
of the public questing but I thought the interface was very clunky I don't know

3256
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:40,360
if it's just me I found the interface to be like really clunky especially

3257
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:45,760
compared to some more fluid interfaces that I've used well the interface for me

3258
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:50,000
I actually was able to manage all the information well I mean maybe it's

3259
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,840
because I'm used to looking at cluttered screens but I saw everything I needed to

3260
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:57,000
see in there I don't need to pull up at this it's like if they would have buried

3261
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,960
it into like a window that you have to pull up nobody would really want to use

3262
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:05,000
it I just want to just put everything up there just make the colors bright enough

3263
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,440
so where you can still see the stuff even though it's just like one or two

3264
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:11,520
pixels wide and it worked and you can still see a lot of the game and have all

3265
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:14,800
the information that you need plus a lot of this stuff for the interface that

3266
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:17,760
they include on the back end like highlighting quest areas and everything

3267
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:21,160
else I thought was kind of brilliant so yeah that's kind of a nice plus is that

3268
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:24,160
yeah it actually kind of shows you where to go for quests which you know you

3269
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:27,640
might be thinking well it's helping you cheat on the game but you know what god

3270
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:30,520
people do that with Wow all the time you know they're just looking up online how

3271
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:34,600
to beat the quest so you know why not build it into the game a little bit it's

3272
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:38,040
not like people aren't going to tell you specifically where to go or show you on

3273
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:42,600
your app you know it works in the roleplay sense yeah but orcs are finally

3274
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:46,640
done right this is the way orcs are supposed to be people blizzard stole it

3275
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:51,200
from from games workshop this is the way they're supposed to be oh you know the

3276
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:57,920
cut yes it fungus though you must be a chaos player oh yeah I am I just I tried

3277
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:02,760
the the human side was like this is boring I do this and wow let me switch

3278
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:06,360
over to the other one and you know like all the all the dark elves listen the

3279
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:10,720
metal they refused to dance it's like that's the way it should be it's not

3280
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:14,400
evil I've been playing a high elf it's been kind of fun because I feel like I'm

3281
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:19,480
going around judging everyone it's fun yeah yeah I loved it every time I click

3282
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:24,040
on slash dance like so-and-so refuses to dance it's like I should be right there

3283
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:29,880
are you suggesting that your night elf is judge dread no she's more of a judge

3284
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:36,200
Hershey actually but you know whatever isn't that the one on divorce court no

3285
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:39,800
there's a judge Hershey in judge dreads just a female one oh god okay I'm

3286
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:45,440
thinking okay I'm thinking a TV show I noticed a female once but whatever so so

3287
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:49,000
you're like in Warhammer online for somebody that's never played an MMO

3288
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,520
before in their life let's say they're just turned off by the whole MMO idea is

3289
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:56,520
there anything for them in Warhammer that might change your mind well this is

3290
02:13:56,520 --> 02:14:00,760
a good gateway drug for a while like experience definitely especially with

3291
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:05,520
the public quests you get to see what a large-scale battle would be like without

3292
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,680
having to worry about getting ganked in the back and all this other stuff by

3293
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:13,120
other players so that's the good entry entry level once they include the like

3294
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:16,200
like a free trial or something for people to get in they don't be kind of

3295
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:19,520
good that's a really good way of explaining is you know core I think it's

3296
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:22,920
the best way you kind of explain it is like you're getting to sample what end

3297
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:29,400
game is like at level five that's what's kind of awesome and also when you go

3298
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:34,800
around versus realm like if you actually go into like the the closed like a was

3299
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:40,240
it they captured a flag and stuff like that they they took a note from City of

3300
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,600
Heroes and sidekick you up to those appropriate levels so that way you can

3301
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:46,800
actually do something at level one if you wanted to that is so I brought up

3302
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:50,960
the same point I thought it was great too I thought it was great yeah but

San Diego coming to the yes does it have the doo-wop group no it does not have to

3328
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:44,720
walk right if I find it but it's an adventure game with learning curve it's

3329
02:16:44,720 --> 02:16:49,440
got a you know a high-standing 3d graphics I've never heard that

3330
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:56,280
description before but uh coming some time soon I don't know where ladies and

3331
02:16:56,280 --> 02:17:17,600
gentlemen I give you I want this fucking song in rock band yes I realize there's

3332
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:31,400
no guitar drums I don't give a shit not just the show but the game itself was

3333
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:37,120
actually she also had a cool cartoon series yes that that's the best theme

3334
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:45,720
song to any game show ever love it we're not our phones not really ringing

3335
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:50,040
tonight I guess we're very we have a very apathetic crowd and I at least one

3336
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:52,840
more call I mean no offense to Xenocore but I don't want him to be the only one

3337
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:57,840
that's on the show tonight apparently we are going to be harder to mod now that

3338
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:03,600
they are being in case some of their drive I season are being encased epoxy

3339
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:07,640
so you actually have to dissolve that ship freakin mod it or you can use one

3340
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:10,400
of the contacts on the bottom of the board so it's not impossible but just

3341
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:18,000
making it a little harder and if you're not into booting say backed-up games you

3342
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:23,160
can still do import games with a bunch of new stuff including gecko OS version

3343
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:29,720
1.07 which will now allow you to boot import games without a mod chip hello

3344
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:34,660
Rama you're on orange lounge radio what's up not too much holy call cuz you

your game world this week although not too much on me and my roommate we're

3349
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:58,080
kind of pissed at GameStop huh really hmm yeah what a shock why why what now

3350
02:18:58,080 --> 02:19:01,360

3353
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:11,880
studio there's a big blank I'm sorry it's better there's a big blank space

3354
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:16,400
right here and I'm thinking what we ought to do is we ought to start over

3355
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:20,960
here like a giant poster board and just a big list things that piss us off about

3356
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:26,680
GameStop and we'll just have a list and start adding to it as people call in and

3357
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:30,600
and what have you I like that maybe I don't know what do you guys think in

3364
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:59,960
GameStop well me and the roommate we were planning on picking up rock band

3365
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:04,880
two and he loves the drums so like let's get the new drum kit so we I called over

3366
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:09,160
to make sure they had it in stock that I asked him are you buying back the old

3367
02:20:09,160 --> 02:20:13,200
rock band one drum kit I'm like they should know like oh no we're not buying

3368
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:18,920
them back and I'm like how come we're just not click Wow a wonderful customer

3369
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:24,480
service yeah so we're probably end up putting them on Craigslist and going to

3370
02:20:24,480 --> 02:20:30,000
another place to buy the arm the drum kit what the hell yeah I know I remember

3371
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:33,840
calling GameStop once and they were like I'm too busy to answer your question you

3372
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:37,680
just have to come in the store and I understand that they might actually be

3373
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:41,360
really busy but there's just better ways to say it you know what I mean like

3374
02:20:41,360 --> 02:20:45,080
working in customer service myself I'm kind of an ass saying when it comes to

3375
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:48,440
things like that you know what I mean it's kind of like you know just just hey

3376
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:52,960

3409
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:29,400
this hello orange lounge radio land it is Jason hello Jason land it's orange

3410
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:34,800
lounge radio what's on your mind so speaking apart have you guys seen the

3411
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:40,280
article that Hart published that had published in the magazine I believe it

3412
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:43,560
was some time this last week about the Republican National Committee

3413
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:48,960
specifically McCain using Barracuda in one of his ads yes I somehow had a bad

3414
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:53,800
feeling you were gonna take this show back to politics what is it you guys

3415
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:56,720
mentioned earlier you were talking about the tour I had to ask to make sure you

3416
02:23:56,720 --> 02:24:00,080
guys have actually seen it because it was priceless it's fine yes and for

3417
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:04,680
those that aren't in the know Hart got their feathers ruffled big time because

3418
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:08,920
one of the nicknames for Sarah Palin who's the vice presidential nominee

3419
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:13,560
issued over the Republican Party one of her nicknames in Alaska with Sarah

3420
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:18,600
Barracuda I can see Russia from my house Sarah Barracuda so they actually played

3421
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:21,480
Barracuda at the Republican National Convention which is as you know a very

3422
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:25,280
popular heart song where you gamers probably know it from Guitar Hero 3

3423
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:30,120
because in that song in that game and heart was pissed yeah I think they're

3424
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:34,160
anything but Republican yeah you know and you know a lot of musicians get

3425
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:36,200
pissed off and that stuff is used because it makes it look like the

3426
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:39,560
musician endorses that candidate when they often don't remember when it happens

3427
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:44,360
both remember when Reagan used born in the USA and Springsteen threw a hissy

3428
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:48,320
over that especially since the song was pretty much about nothing the American

3429
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:52,800
the Republican Party stands for and I'm sure it works both ways like you know

3430
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:55,720
there's a lot of artists like country artists and you know I think you've seen

3431
02:24:55,720 --> 02:25:01,960
people on the convention they that were Republican and they probably don't want

3432
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:06,120
their songs being used and Obama's campaign so it's just politics what a

3433
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:10,400
big mess I seem to remember when I was reading through the news that's actually

3434
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:14,960
like the third time that artists have not been asked not been directly

3435
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:18,960
compensated and through a hissy fit over it well specifically public inside of

3436
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:21,800
the campaign whoever has been getting the music clearances over there needs to

3437
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:26,520
be sacked and then whoever hired that person also needs to be sacked this is

3438
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:30,040
quite possibly gonna be a very short answer I had to step out because I

3439
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:33,560
really needed to get some food during the show but have we covered the epic

3440
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:38,640
rock band crash and character transfer of doom tonight no what's this about

3441
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:44,560
what's up I believe it was ssj 100 Matt published a put a link in chat like an

3442
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:49,080
hour and a half ago pretty short shortly after the show started and apparently

3443
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:56,120
for it looks to be I kind of skimmed but for local games characters created rock

3444
02:25:56,120 --> 02:26:00,920
band two characters would switch profiles that they were bound to like

3445
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:04,560
they would be written out to the wrong gamertag so when one person goes back

3446
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:10,480
and plays his characters completely gone and apparently band progress is getting

3447
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:16,320
completely deleted apparently randomly perhaps when the console freezes up and

3448
02:26:16,320 --> 02:26:22,640
just really really poorly about 11 pages on the rock band forms to talk about all

3449
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:26,800
these problems people have been having and quite unfortunately I kind of don't

3450
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:31,080
want to play the game until I hear of a patch know what's funny is one thing I

3451
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:34,600
did do is I signed up on the rock band forms or whatever you can link your

3452
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:42,600
gamertag to the actual community it's only shown my rock band one stuff I did

3453
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:45,720
that with you rock then I haven't done that since I've gotten to yet but they

3454
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:48,280
don't have any of my rock band two stuff on there even though I've been playing

3455
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:51,880
it online for like a while now it probably takes a while to catch up

3456
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:55,240
because there's probably like tons and tons and tons of people that are all

3457
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:57,760
playing this game online right now and that's probably what's causing the

3458
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:01,000
crashes to is just like you know they're just probably overwhelmed me on one

3459
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,880
hand you ought to think they know how popular their games gonna be but at the

3460
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:07,960
same time you know you don't really know the strain until you put it out there

3461
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:11,040
you know what I mean like you can test it test and test all you want but you

3462
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:15,920
just don't know until it's out there again I'll restate that I only skimmed

3463
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:20,160
it but I seem to remember that it was limited to local games and not quite

3464
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:24,280
online in which case the whole comes the whole thing comes up of do people really

3465
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:28,760
tested and such a narrow instance that they never had these problems when the

3466
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:31,720
game was being developed it just really shocks me that the scores are just

3467
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:35,560
resetting because I would think at least a backup copy saved on your local drive

3468
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:40,080
if nothing else I would imagine the one thing that bugs me more than anything is

3469
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:44,280
it is a you know progress and achieving further things in the game I'm already

3470
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:46,960
kind of turned off just because of the fact that the initial songs are so

3471
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:50,520
terrible in my opinion you know oh I might lay that about the exercise

3472
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:55,040
there's a way you can unlock them all right off the bat you know right I don't

3473
02:27:55,040 --> 02:28:00,280
there's no button code out there I don't want to ruin it for everybody but if you

3474
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:03,320
want to search the internet there's a button that you can do on the cheat menu

3475
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:05,320
that will unlock all the songs automatically

3476
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:09,760
well here's the thing isn't it not safe your progress when you use enables no

3477
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:12,360
they disabled it this time it did well here's what it does

3478
02:28:12,360 --> 02:28:16,540
you can use it's the same code as in the first rock band game and what it does on

3479
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:22,900
the cheat menu is it adds a toggle where you can toggle all songs off or all songs on.

3480
02:28:22,900 --> 02:28:27,980
And if you turn them on then you can't save, but it's more for like parties and that kind

3481
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:28,980
of thing.

3482
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:31,540
Right, I was just going to say, that sounds perfect for if I have a bunch of people over

3483
02:28:31,540 --> 02:28:33,900
really want to play and I just throw it in quick play or something.

3484
02:28:33,900 --> 02:28:38,260
Yeah, you can toggle it on and off once you've done it, it'll save that little toggle on

3485
02:28:38,260 --> 02:28:40,500
there and you can turn it on, off, or whatever.

3486
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:44,060
It's under the game modifiers section under options.

3487
02:28:44,060 --> 02:28:49,780
So first correction, it was Sephiroth1215, it was an SSJ100 mat, and apparently, I don't

3488
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:54,420
know if the forum is just overloaded or if they shit-canned this thread or something,

3489
02:28:54,420 --> 02:28:58,860
but I'm getting an error when I tried to browse to it again.

3490
02:28:58,860 --> 02:29:03,360
I posted it in chat in case anybody else was curious, but something tells me nobody else

3491
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:07,380
is going to have any more luck than I am right now.

3492
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:08,380
So...

3493
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:13,060
You know, I was trying to load the thread too and I had the same problem, so yeah, something's

3494
02:29:13,060 --> 02:29:14,060
out.

3495
02:29:14,060 --> 02:29:15,060
Lovely.

3496
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:16,060
Interesting.

3497
02:29:16,060 --> 02:29:19,620
So, alright, well, Jason, hey, we're going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the

3498
02:29:19,620 --> 02:29:20,620
show, alright?

3499
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:21,620
Alrighty.

3500
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:22,620
Have a good one, my friend, though.

3501
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:23,620
Hi, guys.

3502
02:29:23,620 --> 02:29:27,340
And hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, before you go, you're a drummer, right?

3503
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:28,340
You're a drummer, right?

3504
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:29,340
Primarily, yeah.

3505
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:33,780
You need to join the band that Shane and I have starting because we need a drummer.

3506
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:35,340
What are you guys doing?

3507
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:37,420
We have a band called the Emergency Kittens.

3508
02:29:37,420 --> 02:29:40,180
I'll contact you with more info later.

3509
02:29:40,180 --> 02:29:41,180
Sweet, sounds good.

3510
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:42,180
Alright, later.

3511
02:29:42,180 --> 02:29:43,180
Thanks.

3512
02:29:43,180 --> 02:29:44,180
Alright.

3513
02:29:44,180 --> 02:29:45,180
Yes, drummer recruited.

3514
02:29:45,180 --> 02:29:50,380
I mean, I could have gone to Bobby Black Wolf, but he said that he's got like a million people

3515
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:51,380
that he's playing with.

3516
02:29:51,380 --> 02:29:53,820
I'd always play a game with Bobby Black Wolf, too, if he wants to look me up.

3517
02:29:53,820 --> 02:29:55,900
And any drummer, really, that listens to Xbox Live.

3518
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:57,220
Alright, real quick, one more call.

3519
02:29:57,220 --> 02:29:58,220
Real quick, one more call.

3520
02:29:58,220 --> 02:29:59,220
Who's this?

3521
02:29:59,220 --> 02:30:00,220
This is James Patrick.

3522
02:30:00,220 --> 02:30:01,220
Hey, James Patrick.

3523
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:02,220
Quick question.

3524
02:30:02,220 --> 02:30:03,220
What's on your mind?

3525
02:30:03,220 --> 02:30:09,020
I haven't been listening to the whole show, but have you guys talked about Monster Hunter

3526
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:11,660
3 Try, the information that's come out about it?

3527
02:30:11,660 --> 02:30:12,660
We have not.

3528
02:30:12,660 --> 02:30:14,380
Why don't you share that information with our audience?

3529
02:30:14,380 --> 02:30:20,340
Yeah, a bunch of screenshots and stuff from Famitsu has come out recently.

3530
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:23,700
It's confirmed four player online.

3531
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:27,260
The city will act as a lobby, apparently.

3532
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:30,700
It will appear at TGS.

3533
02:30:30,700 --> 02:30:35,500
The engine has been completely rebuilt, apparently, for the first time since like the first Monster

3534
02:30:35,500 --> 02:30:39,100
Hunter game.

3535
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:43,100
And yeah, it's just a bunch of screenshots out there showing the game and it looks like

3536
02:30:43,100 --> 02:30:47,220
Capcom is actually putting forth a lot of effort into this Wii game.

3537
02:30:47,220 --> 02:30:48,220
It looks pretty.

3538
02:30:48,220 --> 02:30:51,460
What is it that you love so much about Monster Hunter?

3539
02:30:51,460 --> 02:30:55,300
Haven't played it.

3540
02:30:55,300 --> 02:30:56,300
What is it that makes you highly anticipated?

3541
02:30:56,300 --> 02:31:01,980
I know people who've played it and they're very enthusiastic about it, but I think I'll

3542
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:03,200
try it with this game.

3543
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:06,340
What makes you so excited about this release?

3544
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:07,820
Four player online.

3545
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:12,380
If they use the Wii Speak, I guess that might be the thing that gets me to get Wii Speak.

3546
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:13,600
Good point.

3547
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:16,740
Wii Speak has the potential to be pretty cool.

3548
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:17,740
We'll see.

3549
02:31:17,740 --> 02:31:21,380
It also has the potential to really suck, so I'm very curious to see how that kind of

3550
02:31:21,380 --> 02:31:22,380
plays out.

3551
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:23,380
Could be very interesting.

3552
02:31:23,380 --> 02:31:28,380
It's got underwater battles as well, and you can go underwater and the monsters can go

3553
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:32,780
up above and underwater too, apparently, and you can fight in a different environment.

3554
02:31:32,780 --> 02:31:34,660
That sounds like it might be interesting.

3555
02:31:34,660 --> 02:31:35,660
Huh.

3556
02:31:35,660 --> 02:31:36,660
Sounds like it could be a pretty cool game.

3557
02:31:36,660 --> 02:31:40,460
Well, James Patrick, thank you so much for the heads up, and we'll be counting down the

3558
02:31:40,460 --> 02:31:41,460
days to tell this.

3559
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:44,660
Call us back and let us know how it plays out, because unfortunately, I've got so many

3560
02:31:44,660 --> 02:31:46,820
games I'm playing, I probably won't get around to this one.

3561
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:48,300
We'll look to you for a review, okay?

3562
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:49,300
All right.

3563
02:31:49,300 --> 02:31:50,300
All right.

3564
02:31:50,300 --> 02:31:51,300
Have a good one, buddy.

3565
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:52,300
All right.

3566
02:31:52,300 --> 02:31:54,780
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

3567
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:56,980
If you didn't get through tonight and still want to talk to us, hey, there's always the

3568
02:31:56,980 --> 02:32:01,620
email bag or our chat room or our MySpace, our Facebook, our live journal, our Twitter.

3569
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:05,560
There's like a million different ways to find us and interact with us, and you know we love

3570
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:06,860
reaching out to you guys.

3571
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:08,260
You guys help us make the show.

3572
02:32:08,260 --> 02:32:09,420
Any more last minute stories, Loki?

3573
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:10,420
Yes.

3574
02:32:10,420 --> 02:32:13,680
In fact, you would have heard about this early on the Twitter, because I posted it on Twitter

3575
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:15,380
before the news got out.

3576
02:32:15,380 --> 02:32:20,980
But Kingdom Hearts, chains of, or, Kingdom Hearts RE Chains of Memories is coming to...

3577
02:32:20,980 --> 02:32:24,540
To be fair, you posted it on your personal Twitter and not the OLR Twitter, and folks

3578
02:32:24,540 --> 02:32:26,420
may not know you have your own personal...

3579
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:27,940
Yeah, whatever.

3580
02:32:27,940 --> 02:32:33,940
Anyways, so it's the remake that of course came out with Kingdom Hearts to Final Mix

3581
02:32:33,940 --> 02:32:40,460
is now coming to the US to PlayStation 2 in December on the 2nd for $29.99.

3582
02:32:40,460 --> 02:32:45,020
So that's not a bad deal, and of course they're adding some new stuff along with that, a brand

3583
02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:50,580
new voice cast, new minigames, but hey, 30 bucks, that's not bad at all, and apparently

3584
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:54,580
Rockband's down, or Rockband.com's down right now.

3585
02:32:54,580 --> 02:33:01,220
Anyways, some other stuff, and this wasn't on show at all, but I just remembered it.

3586
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:08,780
You remember last year how they did bundles with the Xbox 360 and you got free games for

3587
02:33:08,780 --> 02:33:10,500
no additional cost.

3588
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:18,380
Well, they're doing that again this holiday, and I have what games in which consoles.

3589
02:33:18,380 --> 02:33:24,580
The arcade system actually is getting, I don't know if it's that great, but Sega Superstars

3590
02:33:24,580 --> 02:33:33,700
Tennis, and the Elite and Pro systems are both getting two games each, and those would

3591
02:33:33,700 --> 02:33:38,700
be Kung Fu Panda and Lego Indiana Jones.

3592
02:33:38,700 --> 02:33:41,100
So that's not bad for free, for the holidays.

3593
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:46,420
I guess they're trying to target more of that family audience to fill that hole in their

3594
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:48,020
demographic there.

3595
02:33:48,020 --> 02:33:51,740
Alright, and let's see here.

3596
02:33:51,740 --> 02:33:57,580
Lastly, I was going to mention that around the time when LittleBigPlanet comes out, they're

3597
02:33:57,580 --> 02:34:02,620
going to be offering some free download content, one of which is a spacesuit, so yes, you can

3598
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:03,940
be a spaceman as well.

3599
02:34:03,940 --> 02:34:05,700
Is that only for pre-orders or something?

3600
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:10,740
No, it's just, they're going to offer it for a limited time during the first week when

3601
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:15,660
it comes out, and also you can get a rare t-shirt in it that says, I was there for week

3602
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:16,660
one.

3603
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:21,460
They're both going to be free to download, and the very last thing, this kind of goes

3604
02:34:21,460 --> 02:34:26,980
back to if you're listening live and heard our little funk remixes on there, you too

3605
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:29,620
can check those out for free.

3606
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:40,500
They're all free to download off of the guy's website, which is LIDBJORK.HOMELINX.ORG slash

3607
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:45,620
Nintendo, and the website's called Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo.

3608
02:34:45,620 --> 02:34:57,300
You can also catch them on MySpace dot com slash H-E-N-R-I-K-L-I-D-B-J-O-R-K, and all

3609
02:34:57,300 --> 02:34:58,300
those are free to download.

3610
02:34:58,300 --> 02:34:59,300
B-J-O-R-K?

3611
02:34:59,300 --> 02:35:00,300
Bjork?

3612
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:01,300
Bjork, yes.

3613
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:02,300
Yeah, LIDBJORK.

3614
02:35:02,300 --> 02:35:03,300
Nice.

3615
02:35:03,300 --> 02:35:05,940
And those are all free to download.

3616
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:11,940
He has Nintenseploitation, and then there's another album, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo,

3617
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:17,460
which when I was playing one of those AUG files, it crashed my computer, so I stopped

3618
02:35:17,460 --> 02:35:18,460
playing those.

3619
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:22,100
But the first album that he has, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo, is a lot of Mega Man stuff,

3620
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:28,060
and some of the other games he remixes, Disney's DuckTales, there's a few tracks on there from

3621
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:34,140
that, and Gunsmoke, and of course, oh there's one from Maniac Mansion, that's kind of cool.

3622
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:35,780
Alright, very cool.

3623
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:39,580
Some of them are good, some of them are alright.

3624
02:35:39,580 --> 02:35:47,740
There was one from Mario Brothers, or something that's kind of weird, or Link's Got a Bop

3625
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:50,340
Gun, that was kind of a weird one.

3626
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:52,420
Alright, that's it.

3627
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:53,420
Awesome, awesome.

3628
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:56,920
Well, DarkSakura, I'd ask if you have any last minute stories, but I know your voice

3629
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:58,740
is not doing too hot.

3630
02:35:58,740 --> 02:35:59,740
No.

3631
02:35:59,740 --> 02:36:02,300
So, well, I hope you feel better.

3632
02:36:02,300 --> 02:36:07,860
In the meantime, I hope the allergies die down, and stop scratching at your throat,

3633
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:10,820
because that's very rude when you're a radio person, to do that.

3634
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:14,340
It feels like an undead bird crawled into my throat and made a nest.

3635
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:15,340
You, you.

3636
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:16,340
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

3637
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:20,140
Alright, well I will ask for one more thing from you tonight, and that is, your final

3638
02:36:20,140 --> 02:36:21,140
thought.

3639
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:23,380
Oh, that one's really easy.

3640
02:36:23,380 --> 02:36:26,380
You know what it is?

3641
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:31,380
Dying of fire, immediately.

3642
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:33,940
Loki, your final thought.

3643
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:39,780
My final thought is the Baskin-Robbins, I guess their Heath Shake, has 2300 calories

3644
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:40,780
in it.

3645
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:44,060
Thank God I don't like Heath bars.

3646
02:36:44,060 --> 02:36:48,260
My final thought is Frozen Yogurt sounds really awesome right now.

3647
02:36:48,260 --> 02:36:49,260
That's what I want.

3648
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:51,260
I really want Frozen Yogurt right now.

3649
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:54,660
Hey, thank you guys so much for, unfortunately the Frozen Yogurt place closes at 9, and it's

3650
02:36:54,660 --> 02:36:55,660
now 9.05.

3651
02:36:55,660 --> 02:37:00,780
Thank you guys for staying up and listening to us tonight, and supporting Independent

3652
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:01,780
Radio.

3653
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:04,900
If you like what you heard, tell two friends about our show.

3654
02:37:04,900 --> 02:37:05,900
That's how we spread the word.

3655
02:37:05,900 --> 02:37:08,300
It's all via word of mouth, you guys.

3656
02:37:08,300 --> 02:37:09,300
Really appreciate it.

3657
02:37:09,300 --> 02:37:11,500
Or you could leave us a five-star review on iTunes.

3658
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:13,140
We've had a few people do that this week.

3659
02:37:13,140 --> 02:37:16,880
Thank you guys so much to the new five-star reviews we've had left on iTunes.

3660
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:17,880
Really appreciate it.

3661
02:37:17,880 --> 02:37:20,580
Cheeseburger messaged me with dongle.

3662
02:37:20,580 --> 02:37:23,860
Yeah, I saw dongle show up on Twitter.

3663
02:37:23,860 --> 02:37:24,860
Dongle.

3664
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:31,060
Let's see, we had Mozart FX left a nice five-star review, and Skylark91 left a nice one, Warrior

3665
02:37:31,060 --> 02:37:32,060
Bob a few days ago.

3666
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:33,060
They did the crappy review.

3667
02:37:33,060 --> 02:37:34,060
We call you out.

3668
02:37:34,060 --> 02:37:37,140
Dan Shadow, who emailed us, left a nice five-star review not that long ago, so thank you guys

3669
02:37:37,140 --> 02:37:39,780
so much who have left the nice reviews for us on iTunes.

3670
02:37:39,780 --> 02:37:41,140
Every little bit helps.

3671
02:37:41,140 --> 02:37:42,140
We really appreciate it.

3672
02:37:42,140 --> 02:37:43,140
Spread the word.

3673
02:37:43,140 --> 02:37:44,940
Have we got any one-star reviews on there?

3674
02:37:44,940 --> 02:37:48,700
If we did, I would not acknowledge them on this program, because we don't want to encourage

3675
02:37:48,700 --> 02:37:52,620
more people to do it, because actually one-star reviews really hurt.

3676
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:56,220
Look, if you want to give the show a one-star review, don't do that.

3677
02:37:56,220 --> 02:37:59,420
Go give a show you like more a five-star review.

3678
02:37:59,420 --> 02:38:00,540
It's much more impactful.

3679
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:04,260
Go help a show you do like then, because it's just kind of rude to leave a one-star review

3680
02:38:04,260 --> 02:38:05,260
in my opinion.

3681
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:06,260
All right.

3682
02:38:06,260 --> 02:38:07,260
That's it.

3683
02:38:07,260 --> 02:38:08,260
We're out of here.

3684
02:38:08,260 --> 02:38:09,260
Have a good night, everybody.

3685
02:38:09,260 --> 02:38:13,460
We'll see you next week with episode 296 of Orange Lounge Radio as we inch closer to that

3686
02:38:13,460 --> 02:38:14,460
big 300 mark.

3687
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:15,460
Yikes.

3688
02:38:15,460 --> 02:38:16,460
