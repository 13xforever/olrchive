00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:22,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, September 28, 2008, a Banjo-Kazooie remake gets dated, Dance Hero gets trademarked, and an old friend of ours gets the boot.

2
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:33,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

3
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:36,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:39,142
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that podcast on the internet where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:43,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Because every week we talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:46,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And we invite you to come be a part of our program.

7
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:48,888
[SPEAKER_09]: You can join us in chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

8
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:50,109
[SPEAKER_09]: You can talk to us by phone later.

9
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:50,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Send us an email.

10
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,110
[SPEAKER_09]: However you want to do it.

11
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,731
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are going to help steer the show tonight.

12
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,032
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll be here.

13
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:58,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Leading you through the next few hours where we talk about the latest and greatest video gaming.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,642
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts.

15
00:00:59,662 --> 00:01:02,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:03,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

17
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:04,233
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing?

18
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:05,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay.

19
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:07,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Your voice sounds a little better this week.

20
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:08,114
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

21
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:08,734
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

22
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:09,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to hear.

23
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:12,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:12,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

25
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:13,836
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

26
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:14,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

27
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:16,257
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a stack of cheese.

28
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:20,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if the Justin TV users can see this or they can't because it's hidden behind your laptop here.

29
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:23,020
[SPEAKER_09]: He has a stack of cheeseburgers.

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,760
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only two.

31
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:28,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I mean, McDonald's cheeseburgers are like micro cheeseburgers.

32
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:32,284
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm laughing because he literally has a stack of cheeseburgers.

33
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:40,707
[SPEAKER_08]: As we'll get into it a little bit later in the program, I can't put them on the floor because there's acts of nature attack.

34
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:44,388
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like here in the studio, which we have a real high-tech studio.

35
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,128
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a converted garage.

36
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:49,590
[SPEAKER_09]: We have ants or something that live under the floor.

37
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:59,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So the funny thing is if you put food on the ground, the ants will rise up from underneath and just storm the food is what Loki found out last week.

38
00:01:59,133 --> 00:01:59,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

39
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:00,437
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was a fluke.

41
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:06,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, ants in the garage?

42
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:07,982
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no ants in the garage.

43
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:09,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Ants in my garage?

44
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:10,263
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

45
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's also say hello to a special guest we have tonight.

46
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:17,125
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not very often that we have a fourth person joining us in the studio anymore.

47
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:18,366
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened to the locals?

48
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:19,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Locals don't love us anymore.

49
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:20,747
[SPEAKER_09]: They found women.

50
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:22,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess so.

51
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so we had to bring a woman on our show.

52
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,389
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had to bring a non-local woman on our show.

53
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:28,289
[SPEAKER_09]: But we love her.

54
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Her name is Tiara, all the way from Las Vegas.

55
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello.

56
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:32,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

57
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:32,871
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

58
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad.

59
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,739
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

60
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,480
[SPEAKER_09]: How was the flight?

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:35,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Good?

62
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,260
[SPEAKER_00]: The flight was really good.

63
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,481
[SPEAKER_00]: They messed up my ticket.

64
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:45,583
[SPEAKER_00]: The terminals were down for the automatic ticket printing instead of having to go to the flight attendant type people.

65
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:46,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

66
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:47,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got upgraded to first class for $20.

67
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:48,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

68
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:49,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

69
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see anyone famous in first class?

70
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:53,005
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just a bunch of old people.

71
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Famous old people.

72
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:57,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

73
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,653
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, welcome to the show tonight.

74
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:06,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, the other reason why Tiara was here, she didn't come to join us just for Orange Lounge Radio, although, you know, that would be nice.

75
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:07,798
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I came for Journey.

76
00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:12,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, part of the reason Tiara came so we could go see Journey and Heart and Cheap Trick.

77
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,483
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks, you know, we don't talk about games.

78
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:16,443
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about our personal lives.

79
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:18,185
[SPEAKER_09]: We love Journey.

80
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:20,507
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're Jamie, we love Heart.

81
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:23,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, you love both, honestly.

82
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:23,750
[SPEAKER_09]: You really do.

83
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,170
[SPEAKER_09]: And Cheap Trick.

84
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Heart is great.

85
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheap Trick, they're okay, although they're a bunch of divas because I met them years ago.

86
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,256
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, Heart and Journey are great.

87
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, here's the sad news is that we went to the concert, right?

88
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,542
[SPEAKER_09]: As a lot of folks have been listening to us weeks and weeks, we talk about this.

89
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,563
[SPEAKER_09]: We finally went to the concert.

90
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:41,407
[SPEAKER_09]: What should have been a 40-minute drive up to Marysville took us two and a half hours.

91
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:42,829
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

92
00:04:11,303 --> 00:04:11,783
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura

93
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:37,917
[SPEAKER_03]: We played some rock band over the weekend.

94
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:45,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan downloaded Mega Man 9, which was really, really, really cool.

95
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:52,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was totally just in old school heaven watching a lot of the stuff.

96
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:57,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course I played a little Ragnarok as usual.

97
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:04,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really, really about it for my gaming week.

98
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:05,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

99
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:09,015
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one thing I love about Mega Man 9... I was busy dealing with other things.

100
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:09,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.

101
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:17,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't able to get Mega Man 9 this week because I have my little thing going on with the Wii where I'm not downloading anything else on the Wii.

102
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:21,620
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't have a PlayStation 3 yet, although I'm thinking next week's the week.

103
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,401
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Xbox 360.

104
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:24,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

105
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:30,023
[SPEAKER_09]: I just can't imagine playing a classic video game on that Xbox 360 controller because that D-pad kind of sucks.

106
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,624
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think I'm going to have to get it on PlayStation 3 if nothing else.

107
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:33,085
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

108
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,186
[SPEAKER_09]: hopefully soon, but I love listening to the soundtrack.

109
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:40,147
[SPEAKER_09]: It's perfect for an old school Mega Man game.

110
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You can even use flicker to your advantage.

111
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:43,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

112
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:49,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you get hit and you're going through a tough spot, you just get hit once so that you flicker enough to get through the hard stuff.

113
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:50,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

114
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:52,830
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe there's a reason not to turn it off.

115
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,011
[SPEAKER_03]: It's old school Mega Man, that's all I can say.

116
00:05:58,471 --> 00:05:58,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

117
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:00,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

118
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:02,432
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week was alright.

119
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:02,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

120
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:14,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a bit of Mercenaries, Mercenaries 2, and actually this week I finally got to try the co-op online and it's pretty fun actually.

121
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:22,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing with my friend Sean who just picked up the game and I swear to God this game gets even more glitchier the longer I play it.

122
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome though, I like that.

123
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Did Loki just say more glitchier?

124
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:27,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he did.

125
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:29,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, more glitchier.

126
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, more glitchier.

127
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:35,939
[SPEAKER_08]: I could say it gets even glitchier, but no, it's more glitchier.

128
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,180
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a technical term.

129
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,922
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the most smartest host I've ever met.

130
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:39,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I am the most smartest.

131
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:41,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Smarterest.

132
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:43,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we get that in an iTunes review, please?

133
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Most smarterest.

134
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:48,470
[SPEAKER_09]: The show is great, but it could be more glitchier.

135
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,931
[SPEAKER_08]: More glitchier, yeah.

136
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:52,071
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

137
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:15,584
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a brand new helicopter, too.

138
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:19,825
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy had just dropped it off for me, got in the helicopter, propeller would not spin.

139
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, well, this is useless.

140
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:22,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you were just too fat for the copter.

141
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:23,407
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

142
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:29,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, remember, this is my in-game persona, not real life.

143
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my bad.

144
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto 4.

145
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you just have maybe too much baggage in the back?

146
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:36,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think that's what happened to Aaliyah.

147
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:43,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was carrying around this guy from United Petroleum, the fake oil company in the game.

148
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:45,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

149
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,788
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, the game is just horribly glitched out, which is awesome.

150
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:53,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, on to other things.

151
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:58,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a game, a Flash game actually, called, I want to say it was Me and My Dad.

152
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,671
[SPEAKER_08]: It's by the same people that do Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers.

153
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:05,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's basically you're this...

154
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:13,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it's like some sort of demon kid who goes around beating up other kids.

155
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like most of the people in the game are completely harmless, and just running around, you just brutally beat them to death.

156
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:21,963
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

157
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:23,924
[SPEAKER_08]: This sounds like a Loki dream game.

158
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:25,144
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

159
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:30,146
[SPEAKER_08]: So I played that a little bit, and let's see.

160
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:31,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Also...

161
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:34,036
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

162
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:54,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

163
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:25,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I never saw the guy's dad at any point in this... Well, actually, the title screen did have a larger version of the main character, who I guess was his dad, but I don't understand what Mia... Maybe it's like a twist ending.

164
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:30,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, I don't know, but maybe your dad joins you later and you can beat more people up.

165
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:33,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but it's... Yeah, that's what it was called, at least.

166
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:38,818
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a link on Destructoid for it, so if you want to check it out, just kind of browse back a few pages.

167
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:39,919
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um...

168
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:43,033
[SPEAKER_08]: T-ara, do you have anything you want to share with your gaming week?

169
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:45,155
[SPEAKER_08]: What types of games have you been playing?

170
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:16,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I haven't really had a chance to play a lot of games recently since I just started with school again.

171
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:27,108
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did play Ragnarok with Jamie, and we played rock band, and we made Dan download Jimmy Buffett so that I could sing Margaritaville.

172
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:28,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

173
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,429
[SPEAKER_09]: So you were the singer?

174
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.

175
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me guess, Jamie's bass player?

176
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:36,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I did play a bit of bass, but I also made Dan get Skullcrusher Mountain.

177
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:37,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

178
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:42,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's pretty much it then?

179
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:44,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Band and learning?

180
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

181
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,954
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Final Fantasy Tactics and Joan of Arc on the PSP.

182
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:52,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know much about Joan of Arc.

183
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:52,817
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this game?

184
00:10:53,708 --> 00:11:12,322
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a tactics game, like Final Fantasy Tactics, except for it stars Joan of Arc, and it takes the whole history of what happened during the time when she was around, and turns it into this thing where magical demons are attacking, and you have to defeat them to save France.

185
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:16,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

186
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on a true story.

187
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:18,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

188
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:22,263
[SPEAKER_09]: They took some creative liberties, I think, but okay.

189
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:23,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just a few.

190
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:25,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

191
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:26,050
[SPEAKER_09]: But is it fun?

192
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,092
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the question.

193
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:29,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you like tactics games, then yes, it's fun.

194
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:37,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's kind of smart, even though they replaced all the people that were invading France and everything with quote-unquote demons.

195
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:41,867
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still like if a kid played it, they might learn some history out of it.

196
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:47,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of it is based on actual fact, but then you've got the weird stuff.

197
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the demons and the magic.

198
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

199
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,130
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, cool.

200
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:54,541
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

201
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:17,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Then World of Warcraft, of course.

202
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:22,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess the only new thing I really checked out this week was Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Marketplace.

203
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,410
[SPEAKER_08]: How could I forget playing that?

204
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,191
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think, Loki?

205
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:27,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's awesome.

206
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:29,252
[SPEAKER_09]: It's exactly how I remembered it.

207
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:32,833
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, except I was kind of surprised that, well, I'm not.

208
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:37,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's basically like the Doom port where they didn't really redo anything.

209
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:38,295
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

210
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:45,178
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does bring back a lot of great memories because, man, I played a lot of Duke Nukem 3D when I was in college.

211
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:48,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wish they had it, but I understand why they didn't have it.

212
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish they had the build editor in there to make your own levels.

213
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:52,621
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be awesome.

214
00:12:53,181 --> 00:13:01,104
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too bad that you can't do some type of... Or the other thing I'm disappointed in is there's no Atomic Edition in there as well, either.

215
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:09,668
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a few added weapons and the brand new levels, including the one that parodied Disneyland.

216
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:11,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm disappointed that wasn't in there.

217
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:13,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's a download pack later.

218
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

219
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:14,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Download content.

220
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

221
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,010
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a very faithful port.

222
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,192
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you've never played Duke Nukem 3D, at least check out the demo.

223
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:20,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I think

224
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:21,993
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

225
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,892
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

226
00:13:53,467 --> 00:14:02,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had to pull out of E4ALL, which kind of stinks, but I am not going to be attending E4ALL this weekend after all, and I really apologize to those listeners that were planning on going.

227
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:08,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Please still continue to go to the All Games booth, which is being co-run by the Championship Gaming Series.

228
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:09,921
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be pretty cool.

229
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:19,350
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have some old school gaming celebrities there, and I think that's kind of like one of the themes they're going with is old school, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun, and I'm really sad I can't go, but

230
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry, it's gallbladder.

231
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:21,892
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very common...

232
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:47,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be fine.

233
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:48,172
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's that.

234
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,764
[SPEAKER_09]: and at about, most of them have been three hours apiece.

235
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some were two, some were three.

236
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:13,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's say you said like two and a half hours for each one.

237
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,172
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still like what?

238
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:19,776
[SPEAKER_09]: 750 hours at least of content we've done over the years.

239
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,699
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like a million bajillion hours.

240
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:22,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

241
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Of content.

242
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:23,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Tons.

243
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:24,843
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

244
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:28,375
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyway, let's move on.

245
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:28,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming news.

246
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:30,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

247
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:36,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's a Nintendo 64 game that's quite a classic that I never played, but looks interesting nonetheless.

248
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:38,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Banjo-Kazooie.

249
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,321
[SPEAKER_08]: We knew this was coming, the sort of remake or update to it.

250
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:53,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is coming now exclusively to the Xbox Live Arcade on November 26th, and it will be running you 1,200 Microsoft points.

251
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Banjo-Tooie early 2009

252
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,411
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty cool.

253
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:23,236
[SPEAKER_08]: One other unique thing about this as well, there will be a stop and swap mode.

254
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:32,464
[SPEAKER_08]: And what that's exactly going to do is progress that's made in the Xbox Live Arcade game will unlock things in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.

255
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:34,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool.

256
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:39,890
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an interesting little crossover, but just kind of a ploy to get people to spend their money twice, right?

257
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:40,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

258
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:41,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Castle Crashers, right?

259
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:42,449
[SPEAKER_08]: New character if you have them both?

260
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:42,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

261
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:12,595
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too childish for me now.

262
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:40,017
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura,

263
00:17:57,036 --> 00:18:00,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Real estate is too packed right now.

264
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:03,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I have too many games I have to play in a short amount of time.

265
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:08,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row 2 is going to be coming out and I won't give a shit about this game when Saints Row 2 comes out.

266
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:11,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Kiki Nico in chat says, Rob, it's one of the best on Nintendo 64.

267
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:13,349
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand.

268
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:13,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize that.

269
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,330
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just I never got around to it.

270
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:17,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Do either of you ladies have an opinion on Banjo-Kazooie?

271
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:18,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I never liked it.

272
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Why, same theme?

273
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Too childish, or?

274
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:27,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I mean, this is also coming from the person who just, what, a couple years ago was ranting and raving about Magic Pen Gel?

275
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:29,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, Magic Pen Gel is fucking awesome.

276
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:31,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I still say they need another one.

277
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:33,159
[SPEAKER_03]: With the penis monster that squirts?

278
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:35,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, we're so mature.

279
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,983
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just never cared for how the game plays.

280
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:39,864
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just me.

281
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:49,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I never liked the sort of... It was like it would be more fun if it was actually side, but it was that behind view that just didn't seem very fun to me.

282
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:51,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, interesting.

283
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:54,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't really have a hate or like opinion on it.

284
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:55,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I just flat out never really played it.

285
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:58,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting, though, that overall in studio here were negative.

286
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,871
[SPEAKER_09]: But to balance this out, there's positive in chat.

287
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:03,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says Banjo-Kazooie equals heart.

288
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:07,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Kikaniko says they're not liking this BK Bashcast.

289
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not bashing the game, it's just like, I don't want to play it.

290
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:15,123
[SPEAKER_08]: It just doesn't look like something I would enjoy.

291
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:21,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a question I'll ask you though, is that, you know, one place that Microsoft's really been struggling is appealing to the family demographic.

292
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,486
[SPEAKER_09]: They've always kind of been the hardcore gaming system.

293
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:28,428
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a lot better than Rocky and Bullwinkle, or the fucking crappy Spongebob game that they had on there.

294
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:31,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, wasn't there like a Shrek game on there too?

295
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, those all sucked.

296
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather have, like, you know, you're going to have kids playing an Xbox Live or a K-Game?

297
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:37,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

298
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:37,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

299
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:39,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect for them.

300
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:40,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

301
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't let them play that crappy, like, Spongebob crap.

302
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:45,143
[SPEAKER_09]: That Rocky and Bullwinkle game was very disappointing.

303
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:49,127
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you love Rocky and Bullwinkle, too, it just pains you to look at that game.

304
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:54,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that it may have been good in, like, the 80s or earlier.

305
00:19:55,192 --> 00:20:02,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just now, it's like they tried to bring back, what was that, the, um, what was the race game?

306
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:03,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Wacky Racist.

307
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:05,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Wacky Races is great.

308
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Wacky Races is great for the people that remember it.

309
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:10,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Kids do not know what the fuck Wacky Races is.

310
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:13,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even think I know what Wacky Races is.

311
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:15,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I barely know what Wacky Races is.

312
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:18,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Wacky Races was also in the same tone as the Laugh Olympics.

313
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:19,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

314
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:20,935
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

315
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:26,898
[SPEAKER_03]: All the Hanna-Barbera characters in big competitions, only Wacky Races was... Oh, okay.

316
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:28,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I remember now.

317
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:28,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

318
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:30,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally preferred the Laugh Olympics.

319
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,742
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like the Justice League of these types of cartoons, right?

320
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:38,366
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was all Hanna-Barbera, so you had the great grape ape and hair bears.

321
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:42,269
[SPEAKER_09]: And Huckleberry Hound and all those people were doing battle with the Flintstones.

322
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:42,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Hanna-Barbera.

323
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:43,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I remember.

324
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,172
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that wasn't in this one.

325
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:48,714
[SPEAKER_08]: At least this game did not have the Flintstones or anything.

326
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:50,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

327
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:54,280
[SPEAKER_09]: The licensing fee for a game like that would be nuts.

328
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,962
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says there should be a LaughOlympics video game.

329
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:58,083
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be cool.

330
00:20:58,143 --> 00:21:00,726
[SPEAKER_09]: But the licensing fee would be atrocious, I would think.

331
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:07,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's all Hanna-Barbera, so I would think that LaughOlympics would probably be a lot better than Wacky Races.

332
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:08,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Wacky Races sucked, so...

333
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:10,998
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's that.

334
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:28,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess to make sure you're not burning a copy of the game or something?

335
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:29,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

336
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:52,017
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't work very well.

337
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:59,361
[SPEAKER_08]: If I didn't want to play Spore Online, I could easily crack that stupid code with one little patch.

338
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:03,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I've already installed it on my system.

339
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that it really matters.

340
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not playing the game anyway.

341
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:16,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a class action lawsuit has been filed against Electronic Arts this week over that DRM and specifically kind of targeting Securom.

342
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:25,614
[SPEAKER_09]: This class action lawsuit is claiming that Spore contains, quote, a second undisclosed program called Securom, a form of digital rights management for computer games.

343
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:27,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Consumers are not warned about the program.

344
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:32,157
[SPEAKER_09]: The program installs without any notice and they cannot uninstall the program either.

345
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:50,781
[SPEAKER_09]: The program is, quote, secretly installed at the command and control center of the computer, ring zero, or the kernel, and surreptitiously operated, overseeing function and operation on the computer, preventing the computer from operating under certain circumstances and or disrupting hardware operations.

346
00:22:51,201 --> 00:23:00,903
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was a class action lawsuit filed against Electronics Arts, who's put this game out there, basically saying, you are installing a second program without my consent on my computer.

347
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:02,203
[SPEAKER_09]: That's basically the core of it.

348
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:04,540
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree with that.

349
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:12,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree that that makes sense because they aren't saying, hey, we're installing this on here or giving you a way to uninstall it, say, if you uninstall the game.

350
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:13,747
[SPEAKER_08]: It stays on your computer.

351
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:15,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Forever.

352
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,630
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

353
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:19,732
[SPEAKER_09]: What will become of this lawsuit?

354
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:21,433
[SPEAKER_09]: And I posed this question in our chat room as well.

355
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:23,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think this lawsuit has any merit?

356
00:23:23,175 --> 00:23:24,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a sue-happy America?

357
00:23:25,356 --> 00:23:26,317
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going to happen, you think?

358
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:27,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Settlement?

359
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:29,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Any thoughts?

360
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:35,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I think that they're going to have to settle, at least just to get people to shut up.

361
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,409
[SPEAKER_03]: But other companies have been doing this for ages.

362
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:52,778
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, I think Dell does the DNA program, I think, to see if you're... God, I can't remember what exactly it's about, but they install a program.

363
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,880
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, I guess if you buy a Dell, you know you're eventually going to get this on there.

364
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,762
[SPEAKER_03]: But there should have... What?

365
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:02,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say that probably they're not going to end up getting any money out of this.

366
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:15,218
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably just going to be agreeing that... I think this has happened in the past with other games that had Secure ROM where the agreement was that there is an uninstall program but you have to get it from Secure ROM to uninstall the game.

367
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:18,261
[SPEAKER_08]: But they keep changing the version so it doesn't work, I don't think, anymore.

368
00:24:19,262 --> 00:24:21,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's not easy to uninstall it.

369
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:26,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there should have been something in the manual.

370
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:33,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe just like a little icon on the box that has some sort of Securom logo on it or something.

371
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I happen to have the box right here.

372
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:41,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm sorry, I just have to interrupt with something hilarious.

373
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:41,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Please, that's why you're here.

374
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:52,686
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just, like, I was reading an article about how You Know Who was disbarred, and somebody made a cake and wrote, Dear You Know Who, congrats on the disbarment, you douchebag.

375
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, you're getting to the next story.

376
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,400
[SPEAKER_09]: You're getting a little ahead.

377
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,500
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright.

378
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:02,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at the box, and I'm looking at the inside of the box.

379
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:05,383
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little, you know, what's all in the game.

380
00:25:05,763 --> 00:25:07,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at the back of the box.

381
00:25:07,204 --> 00:25:09,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm even looking at the fine print that gives the system requirements.

382
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:12,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Internet connection is required.

383
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:17,048
[SPEAKER_09]: EA terms and conditions and feature updates can be found at www.ea.com.

384
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:20,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see the word Secure ROM anywhere here on this box.

385
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So they don't tell you.

386
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:50,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly, I do honestly think, I mean, you know, the primary rule is let the buyer beware but still, I think that if they are going to install something without your knowledge when you think you're getting a game and all of a sudden you're getting, you know, this other business even though it's to protect their information I honestly think that there should be some sort of warning so that the buyer can be aware and not beware, you know what I mean?

387
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,470
[SPEAKER_09]: and not have to rely strictly on Amazon reviews.

388
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

389
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:59,211
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing, too, I mean, does your copy of Warhammer have SecureM on it?

390
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:00,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's also EA.

391
00:26:01,172 --> 00:26:01,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

392
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:02,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

393
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:08,014
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm looking at the box for Warhammer, which I also happen to have right here, and I don't think I see anything on here either.

394
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:08,994
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, would I?

395
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:09,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not.

396
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:14,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I do notice a lot of the very same blah, blah, blah on here that I saw on the other box.

397
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:14,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

398
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:22,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I don't like the idea that... I mean, I don't have a problem with a program that's making sure my copy of the game I'm running is legit.

399
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:22,876
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

400
00:26:23,837 --> 00:26:29,900
[SPEAKER_08]: But the problem is, this program is also supposed to mess up your CD burning software or something like that.

401
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:36,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily, it hasn't with mine, because I've been able to burn DVDs quite easy.

402
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:37,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

403
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:40,835
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Drew Nami has a good point in our chatroom.

404
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Warhammer doesn't need Securon.

405
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:46,861
[SPEAKER_09]: It is impossible to play... Well, I mean, I guess never say never.

406
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:51,085
[SPEAKER_09]: But virtually impossible to play this game without buying your own copy.

407
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:55,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it being an MMO, you have to have a key to go online and play the game.

408
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And it needs an internet connection by nature.

409
00:26:58,232 --> 00:26:59,273
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's very easily verifiable.

410
00:26:59,293 --> 00:27:00,034
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

411
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:00,855
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a game.

412
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:01,596
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a copy.

413
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:01,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

414
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,933
[SPEAKER_08]: They do that with Final Fantasy XI.

415
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:10,790
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to have a copy, you know, a content code or something like that to prove that you bought, you know, the game, so...

416
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,580
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw asks, did the end user license agreement state anything about copy protection?

417
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,941
[SPEAKER_09]: It may not mention about secure ROM.

418
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,601
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw said it did not.

419
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:21,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

420
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:25,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it did, I think they might have a claim that it's not visible enough.

421
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:28,423
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people really read those end user license agreements?

422
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:29,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

423
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:29,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

424
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:37,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy before us here on All Games Radio, says the Galactic Edition box also does not state secure ROM.

425
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:38,686
[SPEAKER_09]: He has the Special Edition.

426
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:39,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

427
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:41,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

428
00:27:41,478 --> 00:27:46,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says people actually checked the end-user license agreement and never saw Secure ROM.

429
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:48,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee had another really good point here earlier.

430
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to find it.

431
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,361
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to tell people when you install stuff in a PC it's an invasion of piracy.

432
00:27:54,761 --> 00:27:55,861
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw also says this.

433
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:59,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope this lawsuit goes through because digital rights management is bad enough as it is.

434
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:04,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder, though, when you install the game, there's probably an end-user... That's where that second discussion went on.

435
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,685
[SPEAKER_08]: It's spyware.

436
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:12,710
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a spyware or a trojan, basically, because it's a program that's being installed without you knowing.

437
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is just not right.

438
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:19,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember years ago when CDs, I believe it was Sony?

439
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:21,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the Sony Rootkit.

440
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:21,998
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

441
00:28:22,058 --> 00:28:23,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Rootkit was what it was called.

442
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,642
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a big stink over that, and they had to end up...

443
00:28:27,763 --> 00:28:53,237
[SPEAKER_09]: either replacing discs or something well they had to put an uninstalled program out there for this and people found out you could get around this by drawing a line with a sharpie pen on your disc to basically fuck up the data track on your CD because data tracks go at the end it's a little different I guess but here's the crazy thing about that I was actually reading about Rootkit on Wikipedia not that long ago did you know that not only could you go to the website to get the program

444
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:59,820
[SPEAKER_09]: The Windows official... You know how Windows has their own spyware removal program or whatever that comes out every month?

445
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Like sometimes you see it in Windows Update.

446
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:05,585
[SPEAKER_09]: The rootkit removal ended up being a part of that months later.

447
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:08,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just always thought that was kind of fascinating.

448
00:29:08,868 --> 00:29:10,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So, very interesting.

449
00:29:12,003 --> 00:29:14,584
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, GameGuru says it's a rootkit and no one warned it.

450
00:29:15,324 --> 00:29:17,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering if this isn't going to go along the same route.

451
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:21,967
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, that rootkit thing kind of set a precedent in this regard.

452
00:29:22,047 --> 00:29:26,809
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I think that, yeah, this might be justified because you're installing extra shit that someone didn't ask for.

453
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:38,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if they're going to follow by previous... Because I do believe that, isn't it, once it hits the federal level, if it's gone through court, what, at least three times that...

454
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes a basically... Oh, God, I can't remember.

455
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:44,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I took that law class a long time ago.

456
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:46,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get what you're saying, though.

457
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:53,078
[SPEAKER_03]: But usually, if there's been a precedent set for it, they tend to stick by previous rulings.

458
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:54,659
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

459
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:59,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you have some thoughts on this, you can join us in our chat room, or you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

460
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:00,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll let Rob read it.

461
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on with the news.

462
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:10,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Tiara gave us a hint of what's to come, but please, DarkSakura, give us the wonderful, glorious news that happened this week.

463
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,612
[SPEAKER_03]: In baking news, there's been cakes made regarding... No.

464
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:23,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as stated by Sauce earlier, we have no more of he who shall not be named practicing law.

465
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:29,555
[SPEAKER_03]: He has been permanently disbarred and he's already throwing a hissy fit and going...

466
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:33,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the whole thing.

467
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:43,262
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically saying that it's a retaliation for a book he wrote about the Florida Supreme Court trying to...

468
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:57,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Get past this faith-based activism against the American entertainment industry.

469
00:30:57,586 --> 00:31:02,809
[SPEAKER_03]: He's quoted saying this rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit.

470
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:09,252
[SPEAKER_03]: With enemies this foolish Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has.

471
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:10,573
[SPEAKER_03]: That's his statement.

472
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:18,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft in chat is suggesting that we shall change the name from He Who Shall Not Be Named to He Who Shall Not Practice Law.

473
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:20,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I endorse this.

474
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I endorse it as well.

475
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:22,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

476
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:24,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fine with that.

477
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:27,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hope we don't have to talk to him anymore.

478
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:29,080
[SPEAKER_09]: He Who Shall Not Practice Law.

479
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it is getting a little old, isn't it?

480
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:33,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's already been.

481
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:35,602
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a little old a long time ago.

482
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:55,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Just though, and this is what I was saying when Bobby made his call to us earlier, is, I mean, keep in mind, this is the same guy who went after Two Life Crew back in the day, went after Ice-T for his cop killer thing, and basically, as far as I'm concerned, this man is anti-First Amendment.

483
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:58,588
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what he needs to refocus his efforts on?

484
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:05,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Like reality TV shows that appear on MTV, like The Real World and The Hills.

485
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:07,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Those need to be taken off TV.

486
00:32:08,256 --> 00:32:13,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Even more though, going back to what I was trying to say about, I don't think he's specifically anti-First Amendment.

487
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,821
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pro-First Amendment as long as it's whatever he wants to say.

488
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,002
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

489
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:52,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually, like I was saying earlier, I think this is a long time coming ever since, you know, the late 80s.

490
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:54,117
[SPEAKER_03]: God, what is this now?

491
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:57,379
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years this has been coming?

492
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:08,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm finally glad to see, you know, basically the duct tape thrown over his mouth and, you know, hopefully he'll stop bitching and realize that no one really cares.

493
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:10,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe he'll take up knitting.

494
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:11,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

495
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:11,689
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

496
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:12,970
[SPEAKER_10]: I said maybe he'll take up knitting.

497
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:14,431
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

498
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:16,103
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

499
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,540
[SPEAKER_03]: including this guy.

500
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose this is the biggest defense ever, huh?

501
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:41,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, the Florida people don't like me because I wrote a mean book about them.

502
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:46,851
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they disbarred you because you're a big fucking moron.

503
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:48,472
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

504
00:33:49,687 --> 00:33:51,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

505
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:12,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully we'll never have a story about this guy again, for real real.

506
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:15,748
[SPEAKER_09]: One more time, the FUs of the week.

507
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,769
[SPEAKER_09]: As inspired by a story about this guy.

508
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:37,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a multiple part FU, and it begins with a certain event that occurred on Tuesday.

509
00:34:38,948 --> 00:34:46,516
[SPEAKER_03]: On Tuesday I was driving school, minding my own, and paying attention to the road, and then CRASH.

510
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:53,623
[SPEAKER_03]: The Silver Lancer of Love is now the totaled out Silver Lancer of Death.

511
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It is gone RIP Lancer.

512
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:57,707
[SPEAKER_03]: My baby.

513
00:34:58,007 --> 00:34:58,988
[SPEAKER_03]: My poor, poor baby.

514
00:35:01,997 --> 00:35:04,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I did actually end up hurting my hip kind of bad.

515
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been kind of limping about, but I'm going to see my chiropractor next week, which is Poppy.

516
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:24,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as my week progresses, Dan ends up going into the hospital for, I had to spend like, what, three, four hours in the ER with Dan, with his knee being sprained.

517
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:33,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it was just sort of one thing after another, but everything was happy when I went to the airport and picked us up.

518
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:35,535
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been great.

519
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:40,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for this morning when I had to spend four hours at the car dealership signing papers.

520
00:35:41,357 --> 00:35:44,298
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the signing papers part that took longer than the test driving part.

521
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:53,242
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I now have a happy Toyota vibe, as in Matrix with the Pontiac exterior.

522
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:55,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the big question is, what are you going to name it?

523
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Because your last car was Vic Viper, right?

524
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:02,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my last car was Vic Viper, and the one before that was the Twindy.

525
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:03,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's this one going to be now?

526
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the ship and R-Type is.

527
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:09,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan suggested that it should be Raider.

528
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,092
[SPEAKER_00]: That way she would have a Pontiac vibe Raider.

529
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

530
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:20,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that'll be its secret.

531
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Lord British because it's not red.

532
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan pointed that out to me because I was going to name it Lord British.

533
00:36:26,757 --> 00:36:27,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

534
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:31,160
[SPEAKER_08]: If you named it Ribbon, it would be one letter away from Vibribbon.

535
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:32,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Vibribbon?

536
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:35,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft's Contributed Tonight

537
00:37:03,852 --> 00:37:05,914
[SPEAKER_09]: That's two pretty big deals there.

538
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Add it on the wiki, my car has a name.

539
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:10,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, there you go.

540
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:11,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your FU of the week.

541
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:15,144
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU of the week goes to your aunt.

542
00:37:16,964 --> 00:37:18,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, they're annoying.

543
00:37:18,826 --> 00:37:20,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what did my aunt do to you?

544
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:23,710
[SPEAKER_09]: She's sitting in a house in the middle of Elk Grove somewhere, just tending to the pigs.

545
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:29,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, well that aunt's fine, but the other hunter that you have underneath this floor here, that kind of sucked.

546
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:38,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I put the food, or I should say the trash, next to the mixing board, so if the sound starts to go out and we notice a big horde of ants, we'll know why.

547
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:39,843
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

548
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,955
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week goes to my gallbladder.

549
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:45,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it sucks!

550
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, I don't like you, Rob.

551
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:52,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get all inflamy and stuff inside you.

552
00:37:52,823 --> 00:37:54,684
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're going to have to have a surgery to take me out.

553
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:57,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Thankfully, gallbladder surgery is no big deal.

554
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had plenty of people reassure me it's...

555
00:37:59,068 --> 00:37:59,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a big deal.

556
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:06,169
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, just the method of it all and having to get all the pre-screenings and having to go through it.

557
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:12,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be in bed for two weeks, which is going to suck because I won't be able to do the show, among other things.

558
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:18,712
[SPEAKER_09]: But I should be able to get a whole lot of DS playing in at that time because, you know, I haven't reviewed a DS game on this program in like six months.

559
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:27,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to be the blessing about gallbladder surgery is, damn it, I'm going to catch up on every single handheld game I've been waiting to catch up on in a long freaking time.

560
00:38:27,754 --> 00:38:29,855
[SPEAKER_08]: So F you to the gallbladder for hating me.

561
00:38:30,295 --> 00:38:34,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly enough, Rob's gallbladder is easier to remove than secure, Rob.

562
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:39,798
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been sitting here all night long with that punchline, haven't you?

563
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, just last minute.

564
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:43,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Asshole.

565
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiara, do you have any F yous of the week?

566
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:50,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like to say to Drew that you suck for not coming to my brunch yesterday.

567
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:55,044
[SPEAKER_00]: So F you, Drew, for ruining my vacation by being a loser and not showing up.

568
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:55,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Aww.

569
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:58,173
[SPEAKER_00]: How sad.

570
00:38:59,456 --> 00:38:59,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

571
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:02,843
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

572
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:03,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy use of the week.

573
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:08,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Nate432 says, Rob, you need to give the PSP some more love.

574
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:13,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I do love the PSP, and you know I'm going to love it a whole lot more when it's the only way I can watch movies for a couple weeks.

575
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:17,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hey, PSP is the perfect post-surgery device.

576
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:18,255
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

577
00:39:18,335 --> 00:39:18,776
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that?

578
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:21,398
[SPEAKER_09]: You get your movies, your music, and your games all in one.

579
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:23,200
[SPEAKER_09]: There's your PSP love.

580
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:24,901
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

581
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:28,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Securom is the new gator, says Jurnami.

582
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Gator?

583
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I remember Gator.

584
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:32,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Good stuff.

585
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:33,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Gator sucked.

586
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:34,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Gator doesn't.

587
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever happened to Gator?

588
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:36,962
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably still around.

589
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:38,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to look that up on Wikipedia right now.

590
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:38,883
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

591
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:40,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, another story.

592
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:46,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, tomorrow or today or whenever you're having a listen to this, Monday.

593
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:55,112
[SPEAKER_08]: September 29th, Xbox Live Arcade will be... Or Xbox Live completely will be down the entire day.

594
00:39:56,112 --> 00:40:06,296
[SPEAKER_08]: 24 hours so that they can do some necessary improvements to prep for the next Xbox experience.

595
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Or new Xbox experience.

596
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:11,558
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, with all the fancy avatars and...

597
00:40:12,558 --> 00:40:14,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Other crap that they're adding to it.

598
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:20,283
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's not the day that it's coming out, but it will be the day that they're working on stuff.

599
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,766
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have to find some offline games to play during that time.

600
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:27,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

601
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:30,749
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

602
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to give you some dumb little program that would sneak Gator on there as part of it.

603
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:57,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, that was it.

604
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,803
[SPEAKER_09]: It was weather scope, precision time.

605
00:41:01,104 --> 00:41:01,644
[SPEAKER_09]: That was it.

606
00:41:02,064 --> 00:41:04,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the time on your computer accurate?

607
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,566
[SPEAKER_09]: That was their big thing.

608
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:08,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

609
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:11,608
[SPEAKER_09]: There was this all back and forth stuff.

610
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:16,730
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2006, Claria said they were going to exit the adware business and focus on search technology.

611
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:17,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

612
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,231
[SPEAKER_09]: September 26, 2008, two days ago,

613
00:41:21,932 --> 00:41:30,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Jelly Cloud, which is what Claria changed its name to in June, has laid off all its employees, shut down all operations, and has liquidated all assets.

614
00:41:32,084 --> 00:41:34,727
[SPEAKER_09]: So Gator officially bid it this week.

615
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:38,051
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you like that for late-breaking news?

616
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:41,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would have never known if we didn't joke about it on tonight's show.

617
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:44,762
[SPEAKER_09]: So Xbox Live down for a full day, really?

618
00:41:44,943 --> 00:41:54,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I had to make the preparations last week so we're ready to go back to playing System Link Saints Row 1.

619
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:57,833
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're going to do on Monday.

620
00:41:58,554 --> 00:42:00,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to go a full day without Rock Band?

621
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:01,937
[SPEAKER_09]: What am I going to do?

622
00:42:02,317 --> 00:42:02,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding.

623
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:05,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Xbox Live going down a whole day really that big a deal?

624
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:07,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

625
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:08,262
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't be the end of the world.

626
00:42:09,776 --> 00:42:20,021
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a big deal if you happen to, I don't know, have a new system that requires you to be logged into Xbox Live so that it knows that you purchased certain things.

627
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:24,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise they show up as demos or just don't work.

628
00:42:25,123 --> 00:42:34,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that'll be bad for those folks that haven't done the resetting of their licenses and all that stuff.

629
00:42:34,407 --> 00:42:35,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's play more Mercenaries 2.

630
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:37,944
[SPEAKER_09]: and Watch Heroes.

631
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,132
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

632
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:18,379
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

633
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:48,720
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

634
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:17,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's a thought.

635
00:44:18,814 --> 00:44:25,176
[SPEAKER_09]: If they had never teased this as being an element of the game, I... It would have looked really awesome.

636
00:44:25,336 --> 00:44:27,796
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have looked really awesome when it finally came out.

637
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:35,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So in a way, I think the lesson to be learned here is don't tempt us with things that you're not going to be able to because this is the kind of stories that are going to happen.

638
00:44:36,419 --> 00:44:36,739
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?

639
00:44:37,379 --> 00:44:38,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, people would have been none the wiser.

640
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you there still would have been a lot of anticipation over Fable 2 because, you know, Fable did have its fans on Xbox One.

641
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:45,242
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

642
00:44:45,262 --> 00:44:45,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

643
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:48,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of a lesson to be learned, I suppose.

644
00:44:48,503 --> 00:44:52,684
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, at least they are patching it that soon.

645
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:54,385
[SPEAKER_08]: At least it's not coming like a year later.

646
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:54,885
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope.

647
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:55,766
[SPEAKER_08]: This is in theory.

648
00:44:56,066 --> 00:44:56,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

649
00:44:56,786 --> 00:45:06,530
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, there are a lot of games that are put out by certain companies like EA that come out flawed and patches don't come that quick at all.

650
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,732
[SPEAKER_08]: And I find it hard to believe that, oops, we just didn't catch some of these bugs.

651
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:12,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Mercenaries 2.

652
00:45:14,793 --> 00:45:15,133
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just...

653
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:17,156
[SPEAKER_08]: The Romantic

654
00:45:40,013 --> 00:45:43,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a villager on a perfect date or tag along to one.

655
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:48,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Meaning that it looks like most achievements will be obtainable in co-op modes as well.

656
00:45:48,923 --> 00:45:54,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is kind of interesting because is that part of the programming where I guess once the trigger's hit, it's hit no matter who did it?

657
00:45:55,249 --> 00:46:01,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Or was that something that was always intended to try and get more people to play the game together or whatever?

658
00:46:03,117 --> 00:46:03,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

659
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick comments from chat room.

660
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,002
[SPEAKER_09]: There's quite a few comments coming in here.

661
00:46:35,224 --> 00:46:40,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf says, I've never heard of a movie being taken out of the theaters to be given a new ending and put back in theaters.

662
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:41,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait.

663
00:46:41,392 --> 00:46:42,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I have, I have.

664
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:42,614
[SPEAKER_09]: 28 days later.

665
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:44,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember?

666
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,663
[SPEAKER_09]: They re-released it with like the additional ending or the special ending?

667
00:46:47,823 --> 00:46:48,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

668
00:46:48,303 --> 00:46:50,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes they do, I mean, you know, I get the point.

669
00:46:50,806 --> 00:46:53,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's trying to say that you're doing an apples and oranges thing with that comparison.

670
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:58,733
[SPEAKER_09]: But they do sometimes re-release movies with extra crap to try and get people to go see it a second time.

671
00:46:58,813 --> 00:47:00,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Or completely change it all around.

672
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:00,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, George Lucas.

673
00:47:01,296 --> 00:47:01,416
But...

674
00:47:02,677 --> 00:47:03,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's true.

675
00:47:04,298 --> 00:47:04,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

676
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:09,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Gerardabo says, but are people really not going to play Fable 2 because there's no co-op in it?

677
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:10,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I think not.

678
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:10,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still Fable.

679
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I think at the end of the day, he's right.

680
00:47:13,283 --> 00:47:13,703
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

681
00:47:14,824 --> 00:47:17,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody that was going to buy the game is still going to buy it because they know it is coming.

682
00:47:17,926 --> 00:47:21,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And anybody that wasn't going to buy the game is just going to throw this onto the list of what they don't like.

683
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:28,091
[SPEAKER_08]: At least they came out and said that the online co-op isn't in there instead of releasing it with the online co-op and it doesn't work.

684
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:30,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And then go, oops, we've got to patch it later.

685
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:30,613
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

686
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:32,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Very true.

687
00:47:32,923 --> 00:47:37,666
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, honestly, at the end of the day, is this going to change anything about Fable 2?

688
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:38,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not.

689
00:47:38,886 --> 00:47:39,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not.

690
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,529
[SPEAKER_09]: But, will this maybe set a really bad precedent?

691
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:46,190
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're all kind of... Wait, I don't think so.

692
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,392
[SPEAKER_08]: The precedent's already been set a long time ago.

693
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:54,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, now that we have consoles that can patch games, that doesn't mean that the game has to come out perfect.

694
00:47:55,444 --> 00:47:57,426
[SPEAKER_08]: And not that it really mattered before that either.

695
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:13,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of the games that came out before the 360 and stuff like that, there weren't as many glitches and problems because they spent more time testing them and making sure that they worked right.

696
00:48:13,478 --> 00:48:18,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it doesn't matter because if people discover glitches later on, we'll just go and fix it.

697
00:48:20,143 --> 00:48:21,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's kind of lazy.

698
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:25,007
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of sucks that you buy a product and it doesn't work correctly.

699
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,075
[SPEAKER_08]: because of sheer laziness.

700
00:48:28,896 --> 00:48:31,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like there will be a lot of people that want to call in and talk about this later.

701
00:48:31,717 --> 00:48:32,718
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to keep it moving though.

702
00:48:32,758 --> 00:48:39,222
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting into the show here and we've got a lot of stories to still cover like whatever DarkSakura is going to talk about next.

703
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:49,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it looks like, you know how people were saying that the 360 wasn't necessarily so popular in Japan, but it looks like it overtook the PS3, actually, again.

704
00:48:50,866 --> 00:48:59,271
[SPEAKER_03]: With the recent price cut, it went down, it actually managed to get out 13,777 units, as opposed to PS3's 8,156.

705
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:01,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's seriously giving it the smackdown.

706
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:16,161
[SPEAKER_03]: However, in software titles, it's still basically in Nintendo's pocket.

707
00:49:17,662 --> 00:49:33,352
[SPEAKER_03]: For software, Pokemon Platinum is the top seller, then Dragon Ball Origins, Rhythm Tengoku Gold, and the top three are all DS games, followed by Trusty Bell, Chopin's Dream on PS3, the reprise.

708
00:49:35,123 --> 00:49:42,708
[SPEAKER_09]: So Microsoft really needs to be, like, praising, you know, whatever deity they believe in for Tales of Vesperia right about now, right?

709
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:43,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

710
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:48,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, following down even the next two games after, that are more Nintendo games.

711
00:49:48,591 --> 00:49:53,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Quiz Magic Academy DS and Wii Fit are five and six, respectively.

712
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:57,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven is a Katakyo Hitman Reborn Battle Arena on PSP.

713
00:49:58,077 --> 00:50:00,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Eighth is Wiz Samurai Portable PSP.

714
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:03,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine, One Piece Unlimited Cruise on Wii and then Mario Kart Wii.

715
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:09,763
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very much dominated by Nintendo.

716
00:50:09,783 --> 00:50:18,285
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as hardware sales, number one is the DS, two is the Wii, three is PSP, four Xbox 360, five PS3, and six PS2.

717
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:21,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is actually still impressive, selling over 7,000 units.

718
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:29,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting comment from chat, and I apologize in advance for horribly mispronouncing your name, which I'm sure I'm going to do.

719
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:35,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Hephaestus says, I love the fact that 360 outselling PS3 in Japan for a week is news.

720
00:50:35,578 --> 00:50:37,198
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of is, in a way.

721
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:50,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it really is that, wow, the 360, because a lot of folks say, oh, Xbox is failing in Japan, Microsoft is failing, they don't know what they're doing, da-da-da, or that it's never going to sell in Japan, and then finally it takes one really, really good game

722
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:53,784
[SPEAKER_09]: for that audience to really start moving these systems.

723
00:50:54,324 --> 00:50:58,548
[SPEAKER_09]: The turnaround is somewhat notable.

724
00:50:59,649 --> 00:51:03,932
[SPEAKER_09]: The question is, will it have momentum, or is this just going to be a one-trick pony?

725
00:51:04,452 --> 00:51:10,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, though, that's more than twice as many units that went out.

726
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that

727
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:35,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps if, you know, if it basically, it does have to do with Squeenix support, if I think that they might put the effort into trying to get more of those major party developers, at least for the Japanese market, to try to get more things on their systems, you know, that might help them out in the long run if they can keep that kind of support.

728
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:43,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they need to throw a lot of money at Capcom to get another Monster Hunter game exclusive for the 360.

729
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:45,856
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll sell plenty of systems.

730
00:51:45,876 --> 00:51:46,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Fire Emblem.

731
00:51:48,078 --> 00:51:50,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire Emblem will never be on that system.

732
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:52,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not Fire Emblem.

733
00:51:53,962 --> 00:51:55,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's a Nintendo title.

734
00:51:55,142 --> 00:51:55,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what I was thinking.

735
00:51:55,983 --> 00:51:58,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking actually what you were saying.

736
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:00,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting the name mixed up.

737
00:52:00,146 --> 00:52:01,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

738
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:02,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

739
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on.

740
00:52:20,934 --> 00:52:27,801
[SPEAKER_08]: What we got after the countdown was done is a teaser for a Halo 3 campaign expansion.

741
00:52:27,881 --> 00:52:38,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know this because on Xbox Live, the description for the video that's on there is a new Halo 3 campaign experience.

742
00:52:39,673 --> 00:52:41,535
[SPEAKER_08]: But what exactly this...

743
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:44,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Experience will be, who knows.

744
00:52:45,139 --> 00:52:48,824
[SPEAKER_08]: The thoughts are it's not going to be Master Chief as the main character.

745
00:52:49,826 --> 00:52:51,909
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually they have a whole bunch of...

746
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakdown on the trailer and stuff.

747
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:58,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I know on Xbox, was it on 360 Fanboy?

748
00:52:59,069 --> 00:53:01,011
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a pretty cool video breakdown there.

749
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Obsessive fans analyzing each and every frame.

750
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:04,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

751
00:53:04,174 --> 00:53:04,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

752
00:53:04,654 --> 00:53:10,660
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, along with analyzing every single frame, they thought that they found a date within the movie itself.

753
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, it was January 6, 2009, which would be a Tuesday.

754
00:53:15,584 --> 00:53:18,386
[SPEAKER_08]: So this might be possibly coming soon.

755
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:22,188
[SPEAKER_08]: In January, I guess we'll have to see, but that's kind of exciting.

756
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:26,790
[SPEAKER_08]: At least they're going to be expanding the game some, in case it's gotten a little stale.

757
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Free expansion, hopefully?

758
00:53:29,651 --> 00:53:37,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so, but I think this is actually kind of like Shivering Isles or something like that.

759
00:53:38,074 --> 00:53:40,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Something of that size, because it's a whole new portion of the game.

760
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:44,316
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of neat to see something like that in a non-RPG type game, though.

761
00:53:44,456 --> 00:53:46,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of neat to see the extended life of the game.

762
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:47,733
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

763
00:54:07,643 --> 00:54:25,927
[SPEAKER_08]: to be honest I haven't ever I mean I've played Halo 2 a little bit and Halo 1 multiplayer a little bit but I never really actually played through the storylines of those so I couldn't really tell you what the hell that was going on in the trailers but it looked cool and it's um interesting I mean this will probably mean a lot more to a Halo fan so

764
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:27,828
[SPEAKER_09]: HALO MMO

765
00:54:48,780 --> 00:55:00,423
[SPEAKER_09]: They were working on a MMO centered in the Halo universe and apparently even some pictures have surfaced from what the Halo MMO was supposed to look like and it kind of looked like wow in the Halo universe.

766
00:55:00,483 --> 00:55:01,423
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of interesting.

767
00:55:01,483 --> 00:55:04,384
[SPEAKER_09]: It looked to be kind of simple like World of Warcraft is.

768
00:55:04,564 --> 00:55:08,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Very similar layout for those that play Warcraft or even Warhammer Online.

769
00:55:08,545 --> 00:55:10,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually the interface almost looks more like Warhammer Online to me.

770
00:55:11,545 --> 00:55:12,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of the way it is.

771
00:55:12,106 --> 00:55:16,787
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see characters wheeling dual swords as well as guns and all that stuff.

772
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:16,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So

773
00:55:18,971 --> 00:55:19,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

774
00:55:49,632 --> 00:55:50,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to miss Ensemble.

775
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:12,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to pour salt in the wound there.

776
00:56:12,997 --> 00:56:13,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very interesting, too.

777
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:20,405
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't often hear about what these studios are necessarily working on, the secret projects, when these studios are closed.

778
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:23,369
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of neat that we got to hear a little something about it.

779
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:25,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Dancing Stage Supernova 2, Playstation 2

780
00:56:54,109 --> 00:57:02,462
[SPEAKER_03]: FIFA 09 on damn near everything Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations on DS after that

781
00:57:05,663 --> 00:57:07,244
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

782
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:37,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, the Sonic DS made by BioWare, coming to the DS.

783
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:44,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, Silent Hill Homecoming, coming to the PC, 360, and PS3 this week.

784
00:57:45,353 --> 00:57:46,334
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty awesome.

785
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:50,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Pipe Mania, coming out on Wii, 360, and PC.

786
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:55,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's on the 360, maybe that's an Xbox Live Arcade game.

787
00:57:59,581 --> 00:58:00,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard that one.

788
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

789
00:58:02,637 --> 00:58:05,311
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of games that are coming out.

790
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:09,275
[SPEAKER_08]: DT Carnage on PSP Car Combat Game

791
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:35,063
[SPEAKER_08]: PC.

792
00:58:36,084 --> 00:58:41,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, we've got a bunch of games coming out.

793
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:42,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the highlights though.

794
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:46,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

795
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:49,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

796
00:58:51,954 --> 00:58:53,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me read this chat comment really quick because it's funny.

797
00:58:53,855 --> 00:58:54,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I load for real.

798
00:58:55,256 --> 00:58:58,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, Silent Hill got a 6.5 by IGN, I think.

799
00:58:58,538 --> 00:59:00,399
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes a little annoyed face.

800
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And Frisbee says, IGN gets a 6.5 sometimes.

801
00:59:05,002 --> 00:59:05,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

802
00:59:05,962 --> 00:59:11,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Supposedly, I guess on PC, and I thought this already came out already, but it says Limbo of the Lost is coming.

803
00:59:12,266 --> 00:59:18,050
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you remember that god-awful song they made you guys listen to a little bit ago.

804
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:19,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was from that game.

805
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:20,871
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

806
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, let's see here.

807
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate for PC.

808
00:59:29,683 --> 00:59:31,023
[SPEAKER_08]: We Cheer on the Wii.

809
00:59:33,644 --> 00:59:36,006
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see here.

810
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:41,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, Harvest Moon, Tree of Tranquility on the Wii.

811
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Goody, more Harvest Moon.

812
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:44,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

813
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:46,469
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

814
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:47,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that it?

815
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,770
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

816
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move over to Japan where it's kind of a slower week.

817
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:55,573
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a whole lot of new stuff coming out, but there is Raiden 4 coming out on the Xbox 360.

818
00:59:55,853 --> 00:59:58,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you like your Raiden games, there's a brand new one.

819
00:59:58,134 --> 00:59:59,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even know there was one in development.

820
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:00,015
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

821
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:00,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out on the 360.

822
01:00:01,796 --> 01:00:03,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving over to the PlayStation 3.

823
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:09,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot of new stuff, but you do get some price reductions on Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion and Warhawk are moving into the best series.

824
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:14,381
[SPEAKER_09]: As well as, hey, if you need it, a new Dusk Guard filter coming out in black and white.

825
01:00:14,421 --> 01:00:15,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Dusk Guard Filter 3.

826
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:18,343
[SPEAKER_09]: DustGuard Filter 3 on the Nintendo Wii.

827
01:00:18,363 --> 01:00:22,085
[SPEAKER_09]: GQ Powerful Major League 3 is the only new game coming out this week.

828
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:24,186
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a new game from Konami.

829
01:00:24,306 --> 01:00:26,867
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes out this week on the Nintendo Wii.

830
01:00:36,272 --> 01:00:37,312
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

831
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:06,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Unknown Soldier, Mokuba no Hoku comes out this week in Japan.

832
01:01:06,787 --> 01:01:15,932
[SPEAKER_09]: As well as Nakamura, Sumiko, Tetai, Shidou, Shin, Twig, Test, One High, One Fun, DS Lesson from the Rocket Company.

833
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to figure out what exactly is the lesson that will be learned in this game.

834
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:19,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

835
01:01:19,794 --> 01:01:21,976
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like it might be writing of some sort.

836
01:01:22,336 --> 01:01:22,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's English.

837
01:01:23,176 --> 01:01:23,596
[SPEAKER_09]: It's English.

838
01:01:23,797 --> 01:01:24,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Learning English.

839
01:01:26,741 --> 01:01:28,004
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

840
01:01:37,353 --> 01:01:38,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole lot.

841
01:01:38,614 --> 01:01:40,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like there's about three new games here.

842
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:53,485
[SPEAKER_09]: To Love, Rue Trouble, Doki Doki, Rinkai Gakuhen comes out on the PSP, as well as Iki Tosen, Eloquent Fist comes out, regular and limited edition.

843
01:01:53,625 --> 01:02:02,132
[SPEAKER_08]: To make a correction to the comment in the chatroom that we had, Silent Hill Homecoming hasn't been rated or reviewed by...

844
01:02:04,316 --> 01:02:32,694
[SPEAKER_08]: IGN yet they do have one press rating which is from and that is a 6.5 that's from the official Xbox magazine so all your hate needs to be directed to the official Xbox magazine at this time IGN you can hate on it a little bit later alright that's it for Japanese release dates well how about more news cause no good news is good good news how about it anyway well um

845
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:41,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Hideo Kojima is the hero of many, many a gamer for giving us the Metal Gear franchise.

846
01:02:42,103 --> 01:02:52,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's saying that he's got ideas for Metal Gear Solid 5, three concepts, but he doesn't want anyone to use them because that means he has to get involved and he doesn't want to.

847
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:57,607
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he was going to be stepping back out of Metal Gear Solid, the whole series.

848
01:02:57,927 --> 01:03:01,768
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, I think that...

849
01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:05,180
[SPEAKER_03]: He should have some involvement with it.

850
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It was his story from the beginning.

851
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:23,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that starting a story and leaving it in the hands of other people, especially if you've controlled it so far, it could probably have less of a bizarre ending than Metal Gear Solid 4 had, maybe, but I don't know.

852
01:03:23,411 --> 01:03:25,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked his weird storytelling.

853
01:03:25,712 --> 01:03:31,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can tell you what one of his ideas were for the new Metal Gear Solid game, and I'll give you...

854
01:03:31,918 --> 01:03:33,359
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of a vague idea here.

855
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:41,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, a couple of Snake's cronies will be coming to visit him.

856
01:03:42,606 --> 01:03:46,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, when they arrive there, they will figure out that he's dead.

857
01:03:48,351 --> 01:03:57,097
[SPEAKER_08]: To which they have to convince everyone around him that he's still alive by moving his arms and stuff and hanging out on the beach and that kind of fun stuff.

858
01:03:58,158 --> 01:04:00,260
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not getting the weekend at Bernie's Treatment.

859
01:04:02,328 --> 01:04:03,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was Dead or Alive.

860
01:04:03,348 --> 01:04:05,510
[SPEAKER_09]: The most dorkest thing I've ever heard.

861
01:04:05,891 --> 01:04:07,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here's the thing though.

862
01:04:07,892 --> 01:04:13,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's interesting because he might have actually really meant it this time when he said he wasn't doing another Metal Gear game.

863
01:04:13,197 --> 01:04:14,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Because doesn't he always say that?

864
01:04:14,338 --> 01:04:15,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I'm not going to do it.

865
01:04:15,279 --> 01:04:15,799
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to do it.

866
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:16,580
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm not going to do it.

867
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

868
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:23,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Now he's kind of like, this kind of is like, well, I don't really want to do it.

869
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:27,729
[SPEAKER_09]: But if, you know, they wanted me to do it, I have an idea.

870
01:04:27,749 --> 01:04:27,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

871
01:04:28,496 --> 01:04:32,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was some other type of experimental game that he was working on.

872
01:04:32,863 --> 01:04:39,333
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, as long as he writes this... Sorry.

873
01:04:39,914 --> 01:04:41,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need a Solid Snake party game.

874
01:04:42,418 --> 01:04:43,499
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

875
01:05:07,672 --> 01:05:11,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Hefeistus in chat says, it's like, ooh, please beg me to do it and I'll reluctantly agree.

876
01:05:12,774 --> 01:05:14,074
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of what this amounts to.

877
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:15,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

878
01:05:17,095 --> 01:05:21,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll see if he ends up coming back in a larger capacity or if he really means it this time.

879
01:05:22,077 --> 01:05:27,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly think he really means it, but he's not going to be able to resist contributing in some way.

880
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:29,540
[SPEAKER_09]: But he's just going to probably scale back his involvement.

881
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:29,840
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

882
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, the weekend at Bernie's thing.

883
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:33,501
[SPEAKER_08]: That's comedy gold, man.

884
01:05:33,841 --> 01:05:34,522
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be awesome.

885
01:05:36,063 --> 01:05:42,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, there's something out there that you can play for free on your PS3.

886
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:42,929
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

887
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:48,074
[SPEAKER_08]: There is actually an MMO available in Japan called Angel Love Online.

888
01:05:48,754 --> 01:05:50,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is a free-to-play MMO.

889
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:58,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are instructions online to allow you to set up your own account and basically create your own account.

890
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:01,438
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess login.

891
01:06:01,498 --> 01:06:10,790
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't have a PlayStation Network login for Japanese PlayStation Network, then you can create one and also help you create a login for this game.

892
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:23,254
[SPEAKER_08]: To create your Japanese PlayStation Network login, the easiest way to do that is actually go to a website called JapanesePSN.com and they'll walk you through it.

893
01:06:23,894 --> 01:06:31,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as creating your own login for this game, you can actually go to PS3Fanboy.com.

894
01:06:31,877 --> 01:06:33,458
[SPEAKER_08]: They have an article on there for that.

895
01:06:33,638 --> 01:06:34,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And also...

896
01:06:35,419 --> 01:06:48,987
[SPEAKER_08]: NeoGAF.com their forums there's another article the game itself actually looks a little bit like Ragnarok online kind of except really like chibi with a bunch of people like are you trying to just get Tiara and Jamie interested in this game

897
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:53,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really, I mean, but I'm just saying, you know, hey, it's a free-to-play game.

898
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know what the point of the game is.

899
01:06:55,453 --> 01:06:58,536
[SPEAKER_08]: There is someone riding a giant beetle, so, I mean, that's kind of cool.

900
01:06:58,656 --> 01:07:01,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and there's another giant, like, frog or something.

901
01:07:01,638 --> 01:07:03,779
[SPEAKER_08]: But lots of people dressed up really weird.

902
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone's in a giant cat monster, or cat robot thing.

903
01:07:07,682 --> 01:07:10,804
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I'm sure this will appeal to somebody.

904
01:07:10,904 --> 01:07:13,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the point of this game is or purpose, because it's all in Japanese.

905
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,287
[SPEAKER_08]: So, haha, funny.

906
01:07:15,747 --> 01:07:16,247
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um...

907
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:17,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, check it out.

908
01:07:17,789 --> 01:07:18,209
[SPEAKER_08]: It's free.

909
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:20,891
[SPEAKER_08]: So, free is awesome.

910
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:22,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it sucks, hey, you know what?

911
01:07:22,653 --> 01:07:24,594
[SPEAKER_08]: At least this game looks a little bit better than yours.

912
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:28,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that going to be your new thing?

913
01:07:28,618 --> 01:07:29,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, at least it's better than yours.

914
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:31,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is better than yours.

915
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel Love Online.

916
01:07:34,062 --> 01:07:36,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Also better than Yaris are price drops!

917
01:07:36,124 --> 01:07:36,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray!

918
01:07:37,245 --> 01:07:45,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was rumored that a big ol' price drop is coming for the Sony PlayStation 3, but it looks like it's actually mostly kind of contained to Blockbuster.

919
01:07:46,593 --> 01:07:49,496
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like they appear to be unloading some extra consoles there.

920
01:07:49,756 --> 01:07:51,418
[SPEAKER_09]: This happened on Friday and it was caught from a

921
01:07:51,858 --> 01:07:52,919
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

922
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:15,420
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

923
01:08:39,706 --> 01:08:45,062
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have to drop the price of those because the new 160 is coming out in like November sometime.

924
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:45,785
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

925
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and that's not surprising.

926
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:53,924
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, this is not the price drop you're looking for there, not dropping the system down $200 or anything like that.

927
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:55,684
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just clearing them out.

928
01:08:56,185 --> 01:09:05,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, because with all these games you usually have to install on the systems, you probably want to get a bigger hard drive now that we're learning what it's for, and that is installing the games on your drive, basically.

929
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Which reminds me, I need to get a bigger hard drive for the Xbox.

930
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:12,574
[SPEAKER_09]: My 20 gig drive is finally starting to fill up to the point where I can't fit much more on it.

931
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,216
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's because of freaking Rock Band.

932
01:09:15,576 --> 01:09:19,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been kind of clearing out old games and stuff and I just, I have a lot of crap on there.

933
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,344
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, keep in mind, seven of the 20 gigs gets taken up with that emulation stuff.

934
01:09:25,065 --> 01:09:29,489
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think I might finally have to cave and get, you know, a bigger drive.

935
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:34,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say, you know, hell freezes over and I want to reinstall Final Fantasy XI on my Xbox someday.

936
01:09:34,093 --> 01:09:35,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wouldn't be able to do it without a bigger hard drive.

937
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:37,256
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

938
01:09:37,336 --> 01:09:38,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Or get a second hard drive.

939
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:39,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

940
01:09:40,714 --> 01:09:41,194
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

941
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:36,541
[SPEAKER_09]: on the 360 yep and movies from $2.99 and up $2.99 and up for the HD movies they were still too expensive and I didn't want yeah you know the $2.99 ones are usually kind of crappy things that aren't even real movies usually those types of things that just show off the power of HD players like you know National Geographic you know Discover the World and stuff which you know you might want to watch once to go ooh and ah but that's about it right so anyway sorry tangent my bad

942
01:10:37,296 --> 01:10:39,818
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a show without tangents?

943
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:56,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's some good news for all of our Sonic fans, and hopefully it won't be like some of the previous ones, but Yuji Naka is working on something with Prope, which is the new development studio.

944
01:10:56,290 --> 01:11:02,434
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a website posted that says that it's a new experience that can be played by penguins.

945
01:11:05,953 --> 01:11:06,895
[SPEAKER_10]: How do penguins play video games?

946
01:11:06,915 --> 01:11:08,097
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'll be something with Sega.

947
01:11:09,018 --> 01:11:11,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, maybe it'll be Sonic.

948
01:11:11,122 --> 01:11:13,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it'll be Outrun.

949
01:11:13,266 --> 01:11:14,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I doubt it's Sonic.

950
01:11:14,067 --> 01:11:14,989
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be something new.

951
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:17,633
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a game where he makes snow cones.

952
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:18,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Pengo!

953
01:11:19,332 --> 01:11:20,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you build igloos.

954
01:11:20,553 --> 01:11:21,053
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be fun.

955
01:11:21,354 --> 01:11:24,256
[SPEAKER_03]: But the site... Frostbite 2008.

956
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:26,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll link it in the chat room.

957
01:11:27,278 --> 01:11:33,623
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's got this little flash thingy with a penguin in front of a screen.

958
01:11:33,783 --> 01:11:38,667
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually at probe.sega.jp.

959
01:11:38,887 --> 01:11:39,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go look.

960
01:11:40,468 --> 01:11:44,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully this means that the game will involve penguins because that'll be cute.

961
01:11:44,512 --> 01:11:45,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I love penguins.

962
01:11:46,253 --> 01:11:47,094
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm hoping for.

963
01:11:48,514 --> 01:11:52,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks basically like a blurred out TV, like a widescreen TV in the background.

964
01:11:53,337 --> 01:11:59,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a penguin in front of it with the exclamation point and a question mark and a word bubble.

965
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's looking off to the side.

966
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:04,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And the penguin doesn't look very confused.

967
01:12:04,103 --> 01:12:05,083
[SPEAKER_03]: He just looks flappy.

968
01:12:06,524 --> 01:12:07,564
[SPEAKER_03]: But Rob likes penguins.

969
01:12:08,985 --> 01:12:09,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I love penguins.

970
01:12:09,766 --> 01:12:15,009
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I'm hoping that it's a whole new... I hope it is like a new version of Pango or something.

971
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:17,570
[SPEAKER_03]: It means the next Sega game will be released only on Linux.

972
01:12:19,454 --> 01:12:20,136
[SPEAKER_09]: I somehow doubt that.

973
01:12:20,497 --> 01:12:20,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

974
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:24,085
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be written in Penguinese.

975
01:12:24,747 --> 01:12:26,872
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot understand it right.

976
01:12:27,033 --> 01:12:28,276
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to pay for the game in fish.

977
01:12:30,894 --> 01:12:33,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll see in a few more days when they announce it.

978
01:12:34,937 --> 01:12:54,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Something else that's going to be coming, possibly soon, would be the new Sonic Genesis collections, which is supposed to be coming out on the 360 and PS3, according to some retail listings dug up, and it says each with ship dates of February 2009.

979
01:12:54,652 --> 01:12:57,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, what could that be?

980
01:12:57,534 --> 01:12:59,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Could that actually be coming out?

981
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, retail listings, I wouldn't have seen that either, would I?

982
01:13:06,943 --> 01:13:23,870
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, so, I don't know, it's probably a collection of all the Sonic games It's supposed to be pretty cheap from what I hear And I'd imagine it probably just has the Sonic Sega Genesis games Don't we already kind of have the Genesis games on Xbox Live Arcade?

983
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's the Sonic Mega Collection or something like that, you know

984
01:13:26,872 --> 01:13:27,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

985
01:13:46,653 --> 01:13:47,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee echoes my thoughts exactly.

986
01:13:47,974 --> 01:13:48,834
[SPEAKER_09]: A Sega compilation.

987
01:13:48,854 --> 01:13:50,775
[SPEAKER_09]: That's called the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox Ones.

988
01:13:50,815 --> 01:13:51,815
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like we've seen all this before.

989
01:13:51,855 --> 01:13:53,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the GameCube and Xbox.

990
01:13:54,016 --> 01:13:55,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we get achievements.

991
01:13:55,877 --> 01:13:56,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

992
01:13:59,378 --> 01:13:59,658
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

993
01:14:00,322 --> 01:14:04,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, Sonic is a classic though, despite the fact that they release it over and over and over again.

994
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:05,607
[SPEAKER_09]: It still is a classic game.

995
01:14:06,048 --> 01:14:10,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And we love to pay Classic Games some tribute here on this program.

996
01:14:10,432 --> 01:14:15,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why every week DarkSakura likes to bring us her classic video game of the week.

997
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:23,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So DarkSakura, please go into the Dusty Archives of Gaming and find a game that should be highlighted this week on the program in the Classic Game of the Week segment.

998
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's classic game is Mega Man 2.

999
01:14:29,505 --> 01:14:35,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm saying Mega Man 2 instead of the first one because honestly I think Mega Man 2 was a much better game.

1000
01:14:36,193 --> 01:14:39,398
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to roll that beautiful bean footage, Rob.

1001
01:14:39,998 --> 01:14:40,479
Mega Man 2

1002
01:14:44,966 --> 01:14:46,727
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of us remember that noise?

1003
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:48,887
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Metal Man's music.

1004
01:14:50,768 --> 01:14:55,129
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, it's, you know, it's... Okay, who in our chatroom does not know Mega Man?

1005
01:14:55,229 --> 01:14:56,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have to really explain it?

1006
01:14:56,889 --> 01:15:08,773
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a little blue robot, and you go through all these different stages, fighting off these cute little robotic enemies, and you pick up power-ups on the way, like a big giant Mega Man head.

1007
01:15:11,149 --> 01:15:14,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you don't know who Mega Man is, he's like Bender from Futurama.

1008
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:15,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.

1009
01:15:19,034 --> 01:15:23,196
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, as you make it through the level, you have to fight a robot master.

1010
01:15:23,216 --> 01:15:26,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew, they have whips and chains and... never mind.

1011
01:15:27,418 --> 01:15:37,144
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, basically you have to fight these different robots that each have a different ability and their theme of their stage is, you know, goes along with whatever their ability is.

1012
01:15:37,464 --> 01:15:39,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Mega Man shoots out metal blades.

1013
01:15:40,826 --> 01:15:51,291
[SPEAKER_03]: and Bubble Man shoots out bubbles that don't do much except for the very end of the game where there's only three places that you use the weapon at all.

1014
01:15:51,972 --> 01:15:57,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Although there are some robots that if you do it in a certain order, some are weaker to others.

1015
01:15:59,215 --> 01:16:02,277
[SPEAKER_03]: This music here is Quick Man Stage, which is like the single most annoying stage.

1016
01:16:03,617 --> 01:16:08,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you have fantastic timing, it's almost impossible to get past those beans that shoot across.

1017
01:16:08,846 --> 01:16:09,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Use Flashman power.

1018
01:16:09,908 --> 01:16:10,970
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, use Flashman power.

1019
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:13,254
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Dan can do it without using Flashman's thing.

1020
01:16:13,274 --> 01:16:13,995
[SPEAKER_09]: That's insane.

1021
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:15,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen him do it.

1022
01:16:15,217 --> 01:16:17,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not believe he could do it until I saw him do it.

1023
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:21,484
[SPEAKER_09]: And plus you need that Flashman power to beat the boss.

1024
01:16:21,604 --> 01:16:23,026
[SPEAKER_09]: It really helps beating the boss.

1025
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:26,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you can take like a third of his life away instantly if you have all the Flashman power.

1026
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:36,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like I was saying earlier, each of the enemies in the game have a particular weakness to the other bosses' master's powers.

1027
01:16:37,681 --> 01:16:38,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can...

1028
01:16:39,482 --> 01:16:46,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for like Airman, which you can only really get him with the regular shot and the metal blades work on him too.

1029
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:48,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're supposed to use Leaf Shield if you have it.

1030
01:16:48,931 --> 01:16:49,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I think.

1031
01:16:49,812 --> 01:16:50,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I might be wrong.

1032
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:51,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I always just started off with Airman.

1033
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:54,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I either started off with Metal Man or Airman.

1034
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:55,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I started with Metal Man.

1035
01:16:55,757 --> 01:16:56,778
[SPEAKER_03]: That person just did it, see?

1036
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you have to have impeccable timing to be able to get past this part though.

1037
01:17:02,043 --> 01:17:03,264
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to have it memorized.

1038
01:17:04,056 --> 01:17:09,103
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to link that one in the chatroom, because I was very... And he even got the power-up, too.

1039
01:17:09,203 --> 01:17:10,344
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the part that always got me.

1040
01:17:11,406 --> 01:17:11,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1041
01:17:12,387 --> 01:17:13,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, it was... Yeah, it was this one, sorry.

1042
01:17:15,992 --> 01:17:18,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I know this is really great radio, but I...

1043
01:17:21,309 --> 01:17:24,010
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually one of my all-time favorite games.

1044
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:25,490
[SPEAKER_03]: It is up there on the list.

1045
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:32,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I even got so bored one day that I cracked the code by myself just experimenting with it.

1046
01:17:32,592 --> 01:17:39,814
[SPEAKER_03]: The password code where you put in the red blocks and blue blocks wherever to get past whatever and get all of the power-ups and everything.

1047
01:17:40,214 --> 01:17:42,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wrote it on a pair of torn up blue jeans.

1048
01:17:43,855 --> 01:17:46,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually had it rolled up like a scroll.

1049
01:17:46,577 --> 01:17:47,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Scroll and everything?

1050
01:17:47,257 --> 01:17:48,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Scroll.

1051
01:17:48,157 --> 01:17:49,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a scroll and everything.

1052
01:17:49,238 --> 01:17:53,280
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my special thing to get past that.

1053
01:17:54,261 --> 01:18:07,628
[SPEAKER_03]: The other cool thing about this one is that they actually had to fight to get this one out since the first Mega Man didn't have, well, Rockman, I should say, in Japan, didn't really have that big of a following.

1054
01:18:08,348 --> 01:18:21,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But since they put more work into the game and improved the graphics and the overall play of it, they were able to get this out and since then it's become basically a staple of almost anyone's classic collection.

1055
01:18:22,515 --> 01:18:30,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it spawned so many sequels that we've lost count, including a couple of fighting games, the Power Battles, and a few...

1056
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:36,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Other, uh, there's even the whole, um, uh, Mega Man EXE series.

1057
01:18:36,861 --> 01:18:38,522
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we wouldn't have that without this.

1058
01:18:39,062 --> 01:18:41,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I think we'd be better off without it, because I don't really care for it personally.

1059
01:18:43,203 --> 01:18:49,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it also made, um, GameSpot's, uh, greatest games of all time.

1060
01:18:49,544 --> 01:18:53,425
[SPEAKER_03]: It was number 33 in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever list.

1061
01:18:54,566 --> 01:18:54,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1062
01:18:56,283 --> 01:18:57,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It also had a novelization.

1063
01:18:58,045 --> 01:19:00,708
[SPEAKER_03]: They released a novel of it.

1064
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:09,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it was only in the U.S., but it was put out by Scholastic like every other dance kid's book in the late 80s and early 90s.

1065
01:19:09,058 --> 01:19:11,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that the same guy who did the Blaster Master books and all that stuff?

1066
01:19:12,012 --> 01:19:13,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I... It doesn't say.

1067
01:19:13,454 --> 01:19:13,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

1068
01:19:13,755 --> 01:19:14,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't say.

1069
01:19:16,499 --> 01:19:19,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It also had, like, one of the best worst cover arts ever.

1070
01:19:21,025 --> 01:19:23,588
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because it had him holding the gun and everything and had the visor.

1071
01:19:23,829 --> 01:19:25,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just stupid and ugly.

1072
01:19:26,072 --> 01:19:28,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there was a Navi mode in the game.

1073
01:19:29,196 --> 01:19:49,790
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got the Rockman Complete Works discs that came out on PlayStation in 1999 in Japan, which were the NES versions with the tons of bonuses, but also had a sort of, I guess a commentary kind of mode for playing through the game.

1074
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also included in the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.

1075
01:19:53,813 --> 01:19:56,935
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on PS2 and GameCube and Xbox.

1076
01:19:59,776 --> 01:20:00,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's one of my favorite games.

1077
01:20:01,017 --> 01:20:03,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, this is the game that gave us Rush, remember?

1078
01:20:03,797 --> 01:20:08,379
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get the platform, or the jet, or the other Rush thing that I forget.

1079
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:11,179
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it, the one that wrote up walls?

1080
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:12,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Number 3.

1081
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1082
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:19,662
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also had the e-tank, so you could get your full refill system and everything.

1083
01:20:20,562 --> 01:20:26,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the one that I think set the stage for the releases afterwards.

1084
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:30,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really the one that Mega Man 9 is even modeled after.

1085
01:20:30,724 --> 01:20:33,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you don't have the power slide or a lot of that stuff that came even in 3.

1086
01:20:34,606 --> 01:20:35,626
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't see that in 9.

1087
01:20:35,686 --> 01:20:39,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, 9 is in some ways a direct sequel to 2, not to 8.

1088
01:20:40,289 --> 01:20:41,869
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the way it plays, it does.

1089
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:48,413
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be technical, there was actually... For 8 and 9, there was a game that came in between.

1090
01:20:49,293 --> 01:20:54,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to say that it was Mega Man and Bass...

1091
01:20:56,423 --> 01:21:01,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when Mega Man and Bass came out, it was actually under development.

1092
01:21:01,507 --> 01:21:03,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It was titled Rock 8.5.

1093
01:21:04,809 --> 01:21:12,454
[SPEAKER_03]: So, 9 is supposed to be a direct sequel, I mean an actual full sequel to 8 following through that whole thing.

1094
01:21:13,355 --> 01:21:22,441
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, this is the one I will sit back and go, and for a little while, I can't do it now because of course it's been a while since I've played this game regularly.

1095
01:21:22,761 --> 01:21:24,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be able to do the dragon part blindfolded.

1096
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:28,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's the same pattern, if you know the pattern.

1097
01:21:29,124 --> 01:21:34,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would die sometimes, but if you know the pattern, then it wasn't really all that hard, because it did the same damn thing every time.

1098
01:21:38,013 --> 01:21:42,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, if you don't have all your... That's more impressive than being able to do the quick man beams, in my opinion.

1099
01:21:43,257 --> 01:21:51,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, if you don't know how to do... Well, if you don't save all your crash blocks to that one, like, right towards the end, then you're screwed for the whole rest of the game.

1100
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:53,935
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1101
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:25,778
[SPEAKER_09]: although I would recommend instead of getting it on virtual console just get, even though I know people at the GameCube version of the Mega Man Collection just get the Mega Man Collection

1102
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:28,744
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you have to have the Nintendo.

1103
01:22:55,049 --> 01:22:56,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa, what is going on over there?

1104
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:57,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I dropped the microphone.

1105
01:22:58,514 --> 01:23:00,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's about ready to just run out of here now that it's break time.

1106
01:23:00,998 --> 01:23:01,378
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

1107
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:03,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1108
01:23:10,342 --> 01:23:11,103
[SPEAKER_09]: XBOX 360 CODE FOR FEEDING FRENZY 2

1109
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:41,087
[SPEAKER_09]: All you have to do is send us an email and please make sure it's an email we can get back to you at because that's where we're sending the code.

1110
01:23:41,107 --> 01:23:42,027
[SPEAKER_09]: If you win, it's feeding frenzy 2.

1111
01:24:06,043 --> 01:24:33,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Giveaway here on Orange Lounge Radio We'll give that away next week live Gaming Radio, so uncensored That even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us Orange Lounge Radio And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday evening September the 28th of 2008 if you can believe it October's almost here and then pretty soon it'll be 2009

1112
01:24:35,486 --> 01:24:36,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Where does the time go?

1113
01:24:36,487 --> 01:24:37,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anymore

1114
01:25:05,973 --> 01:25:06,513
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1115
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:31,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, one of the routes that they're going with this is I guess it's going to support using SD memory cards.

1116
01:25:32,411 --> 01:25:38,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll be able to transfer stuff back and forth from your Wii system to your DS.

1117
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:43,837
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be able to load songs onto it as well through that.

1118
01:25:45,358 --> 01:25:48,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And the newspaper looks like Nikkei.

1119
01:25:50,009 --> 01:25:54,034
[SPEAKER_08]: They are expecting that the system will be priced under 20,000 yen.

1120
01:25:54,274 --> 01:26:00,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Nintendo DS Lite currently is priced at 16,800 yen in Japan.

1121
01:26:04,028 --> 01:26:14,990
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks like the new DS will launch first in Japan with other countries seeing an allocation of several hundred thousand units before anybody else overseas sees them.

1122
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:31,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting and funny because this kind of goes in with the other story that's come out a couple days ago about how Nintendo will be doing a media event on October 2nd and 3rd.

1123
01:26:34,005 --> 01:26:38,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, a little interesting that this comes out in a newspaper.

1124
01:26:40,048 --> 01:26:43,649
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think that they would run rumors.

1125
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:50,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And what other announcements could we possibly expect from this media event?

1126
01:26:50,212 --> 01:26:55,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this is, I think, their opportunity to save face from E3.

1127
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:04,791
[SPEAKER_08]: My guess, which is interesting, my guess would be, of course, announcing Disaster Day of Crisis since it's already out in Japan.

1128
01:27:05,371 --> 01:27:06,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Europe is right around the corner.

1129
01:27:06,552 --> 01:27:07,912
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't announced a date for the U.S.

1130
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,312
[SPEAKER_08]: yet.

1131
01:27:09,412 --> 01:27:15,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other thing I wouldn't be surprised if I saw was that they're publishing Conduit.

1132
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:21,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you notice, for a game that doesn't have a publisher, there's sure a lot of screenshots coming out every single day.

1133
01:27:22,374 --> 01:27:25,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And kind of the whole marketing campaign is in full force.

1134
01:27:26,135 --> 01:27:32,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of makes you go, hmm, why would they be trying to market this game so strongly right now when they don't even have a publisher yet?

1135
01:27:32,717 --> 01:27:35,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Because usually the publisher is the one that does the marketing for them.

1136
01:27:36,819 --> 01:27:39,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting to think about that maybe this game is right around the corner.

1137
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe Nintendo's publishing it.

1138
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,081
[SPEAKER_08]: After all, it was in Nintendo's booth at PAX.

1139
01:27:47,382 --> 01:27:47,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Might be a guess.

1140
01:27:49,203 --> 01:27:53,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hey, before the show, and that DS is supposed to be out this year.

1141
01:27:54,332 --> 01:27:59,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So that could be, you know, that's probably some of the strongest evidence as to why they would need a special press conference to announce it.

1142
01:27:59,995 --> 01:28:00,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1143
01:28:00,295 --> 01:28:01,096
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out this year.

1144
01:28:01,816 --> 01:28:02,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

1145
01:28:02,336 --> 01:28:02,816
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

1146
01:28:02,856 --> 01:28:05,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you buy a DS for the camera and the music and all this stuff?

1147
01:28:06,058 --> 01:28:06,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1148
01:28:06,879 --> 01:28:07,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe?

1149
01:28:07,599 --> 01:28:07,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1150
01:28:07,919 --> 01:28:08,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to see if it's worth it.

1151
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I expected you to say give me a flat up no.

1152
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of surprised.

1153
01:28:13,654 --> 01:28:18,318
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is, what other applications on the homebrew site could use this camera and stuff?

1154
01:28:19,318 --> 01:28:20,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be more interested to see that.

1155
01:28:20,519 --> 01:28:21,560
[SPEAKER_08]: You just want to hack it.

1156
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:22,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1157
01:28:22,701 --> 01:28:23,642
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what do you think?

1158
01:28:24,463 --> 01:28:25,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't waste my money on it.

1159
01:28:25,804 --> 01:28:27,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I already have 50 million other things that do all that.

1160
01:28:28,606 --> 01:28:29,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an iPhone.

1161
01:28:29,367 --> 01:28:32,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need anything else that takes pictures or plays music.

1162
01:28:33,831 --> 01:28:35,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiara, any thoughts for you on this?

1163
01:28:37,008 --> 01:28:40,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said on Twitter, if it's not broke, don't fix it.

1164
01:28:40,471 --> 01:28:43,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I already have a DS that works, so there's no reason for me to buy another one.

1165
01:28:44,534 --> 01:28:48,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Twitter, let's go over there and look at the answers to tonight's pre-show question.

1166
01:28:48,497 --> 01:28:55,103
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a Twitter account at OLR, simply our Twitter name, and sometimes we ask some questions before the show and read some of our favorite answers on the air.

1167
01:28:55,143 --> 01:29:00,467
[SPEAKER_09]: We asked, would you buy the Nintendo DS again if they re-release it with a camera and music playback abilities?

1168
01:29:01,328 --> 01:29:04,891
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a lot of replies tonight, so I'm going to try to read from people we don't usually hear from.

1169
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,213
[SPEAKER_09]: in the chat room or on Skype.

1170
01:29:07,833 --> 01:29:13,057
[SPEAKER_09]: JohnnyG44 says, no, because almost everyone has a phone that can do both of those things.

1171
01:29:13,378 --> 01:29:15,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I would buy a new DS with onboard memory storage, though.

1172
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:20,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Crows says, I have a cell phone with two megapixels and an iPod with 30 gigabytes.

1173
01:29:20,884 --> 01:29:21,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need those features.

1174
01:29:22,165 --> 01:29:23,406
[SPEAKER_09]: It would just make it cost like 300 bucks.

1175
01:29:26,735 --> 01:29:32,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says, no, most people have an MP3 player, a digital camera, a camera MP3 phone, and a DS already.

1176
01:29:32,439 --> 01:29:34,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Why pay for all three of these all over again?

1177
01:29:35,582 --> 01:29:42,707
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkCircuitry says, I don't have a DS in the first place, but I'd happily buy one if it had those extra features, albeit at a lower price than it is now.

1178
01:29:43,728 --> 01:29:45,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Decipher13 says, I'm still packing a fat...

1179
01:29:46,744 --> 01:30:02,343
[SPEAKER_09]: A fat, a DS fat I've held off on getting a light so far But I do collect Nintendo handhelds I may eventually I collect Nintendo handhelds Can you imagine though if they did have storage Like say a gig of storage space on there How bad that would make the Wii look

1180
01:30:02,978 --> 01:30:06,021
[SPEAKER_08]: GBA Multiplayer Compatibility Back, but the camera would be flippin' awesome.

1181
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So kind of a wide variety of answers on our Twitter.

1182
01:30:29,582 --> 01:30:32,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even read them all, but it's very varied in the yeses and nos there.

1183
01:30:33,065 --> 01:30:34,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to everybody that replied on Twitter.

1184
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:37,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to those that didn't get through, but I tried to focus on those that usually don't join us in chat.

1185
01:30:39,031 --> 01:30:40,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting, the diverse amount of responses.

1186
01:30:41,113 --> 01:30:44,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there were enough yeses, though, that this is going to be successful if they release it.

1187
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:47,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're not really having trouble selling DSs right now, I think.

1188
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,541
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're not really...

1189
01:30:50,802 --> 01:30:54,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the PSP is getting close to them anytime soon.

1190
01:30:54,548 --> 01:30:57,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is obviously competing against Apple.

1191
01:30:57,792 --> 01:31:06,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because now that they're becoming the gaming portable system, I mean, that's hard to swallow, but you know.

1192
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe this is the compete with them.

1193
01:31:09,983 --> 01:31:10,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's cheaper.

1194
01:31:11,445 --> 01:31:11,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

1195
01:31:12,026 --> 01:31:16,611
[SPEAKER_09]: This seems kind of a long ways afterwards to compete with PSP.

1196
01:31:17,032 --> 01:31:23,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And now that we have camera functionality, I mean, how long will it be before we get gimmicky shit to go along with that?

1197
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:24,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know.

1198
01:31:26,304 --> 01:31:26,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

1199
01:31:26,832 --> 01:31:36,397
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, you know, if they hadn't moved enough copies of the DS Lite, maybe doing some charitable work would convince more people to get a DS, and that is just what is happening.

1200
01:31:37,918 --> 01:31:42,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazon has actually released a new version of the Nintendo DS, apparently, on their site.

1201
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:56,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what's called the Polar White Console, but one special difference between this and a normal DS is that it actually has the pink breast cancer awareness ribbon, kind of like a universal logo, if you will, right there on the DS itself.

1202
01:31:56,887 --> 01:32:13,191
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be $129.99, which is what any other DS would cost, but Nintendo is donating $5 from every purchase of one of these Nintendo DSs to a cancer research charity, a very commonly heard one in breast cancer awareness circles, Susan G. Komen for the cure.

1203
01:32:13,551 --> 01:32:15,832
[SPEAKER_09]: The minimum donation promised is $100,000.

1204
01:32:16,672 --> 01:32:19,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go, if you want to do a little bit of charity.

1205
01:32:20,322 --> 01:32:21,162
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1206
01:32:43,747 --> 01:32:49,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see myself going out and buying another DS just for this when I could donate $20 myself.

1207
01:32:49,512 --> 01:32:50,012
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1208
01:32:50,873 --> 01:32:52,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1209
01:32:52,914 --> 01:32:57,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to ask a question I think is out there, but some people might be too afraid to ask.

1210
01:32:57,918 --> 01:32:59,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to put it out there.

1211
01:32:59,939 --> 01:33:03,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this another way that Nintendo is trying to get women?

1212
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:13,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I hate to say it's a marketing ploy, but in a way, look at what they've been advertising lately.

1213
01:33:13,085 --> 01:33:14,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Carrie Underwood, Pink DSes.

1214
01:33:15,986 --> 01:33:19,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a way for them to try and attract women to the Nintendo DS?

1215
01:33:20,389 --> 01:33:29,274
[SPEAKER_00]: I would totally date Nintendo DS if he got a better job and could prove that he's into being committed to our relationship.

1216
01:33:31,642 --> 01:33:34,444
[SPEAKER_09]: What does him adoring a pink ribbon do for you?

1217
01:33:34,664 --> 01:33:36,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it make him that much sexier?

1218
01:33:38,707 --> 01:33:39,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

1219
01:33:39,928 --> 01:33:48,093
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to donate $5 towards breast cancer, I could just donate $5 instead of going out and buying a whole new DS.

1220
01:33:48,253 --> 01:33:55,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I could donate however much I want and get that as a tax write-off, where it doesn't work that way if you buy the pink DS and let Nintendo give them $5.

1221
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:55,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1222
01:33:57,299 --> 01:34:11,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, on top of that, with all of these, you know, for example, the runs, the marketing going in behind this, that's money they're spending on marketing and organizing events that actually just could go to the research.

1223
01:34:11,962 --> 01:34:21,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially for, you know, as poorly coordinated as a lot of the research is right now, they should put, you know, the money into... We're all aware.

1224
01:34:22,143 --> 01:34:23,304
[SPEAKER_03]: The awareness is there.

1225
01:34:23,964 --> 01:34:25,624
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that the money is better...

1226
01:34:26,505 --> 01:34:31,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can go on the- Apply towards the event, you know, towards not the awareness of, but the treatment thereof.

1227
01:34:32,272 --> 01:34:35,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't know how to donate, I mean, you can go to their website online.

1228
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:40,201
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so simple and pretty much, I mean, there's links to tell you how to donate right there.

1229
01:34:40,221 --> 01:34:43,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean- Komen.org, K-O-M-E-N.org.

1230
01:34:43,906 --> 01:34:44,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1231
01:34:44,326 --> 01:34:44,767
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1232
01:34:46,775 --> 01:34:51,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, but this is, it does seem kind of like a cheap attempt to get women to play their damn console.

1233
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:56,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I hate to say it, but you know a lot of people are thinking it.

1234
01:34:56,623 --> 01:35:01,287
[SPEAKER_08]: If you really want to make an impact to breast cancer and you don't really care about this console, donate $129.99 to breast cancer then.

1235
01:35:01,307 --> 01:35:01,707
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1236
01:35:05,558 --> 01:35:12,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think there's a happy medium somewhere, but it's just... Or charge a little more money for it.

1237
01:35:12,404 --> 01:35:13,986
[SPEAKER_09]: They do that with postage stamps, right?

1238
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:17,569
[SPEAKER_09]: They charge a little more money for it, but it's that extra money that goes towards the research.

1239
01:35:17,589 --> 01:35:18,370
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like a donation.

1240
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:18,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1241
01:35:19,471 --> 01:35:22,554
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just so that they can come out later on and go, look, we donated $100,000 to breast cancer.

1242
01:35:22,574 --> 01:35:22,874
[SPEAKER_08]: We're so...

1243
01:35:26,175 --> 01:35:27,177
[SPEAKER_08]: We're so helpful.

1244
01:35:27,538 --> 01:35:28,861
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all for PR.

1245
01:35:28,901 --> 01:35:30,044
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all to make them look good.

1246
01:35:30,525 --> 01:35:36,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Giovedea in our chatroom says, Sorry, but as a girl, I'd probably break a pink DS with a hammer because it would be fun.

1247
01:35:38,188 --> 01:35:48,031
[SPEAKER_09]: So sometimes, you know, you don't always get all the women with the pink and all that, but my question would be, but what do you think of the white DS with the pink ribbon?

1248
01:35:48,831 --> 01:36:05,155
[SPEAKER_08]: What about, you know, because they always talk about breast cancer and stuff, and they have really good campaigns for breast cancer and cervical cancer and that kind of stuff, but heart disease, just lung cancer, you know, diabetes, stuff like that, you know, that kills a lot more people than breast cancer, so...

1249
01:36:06,001 --> 01:36:08,022
[SPEAKER_08]: How about donating to that instead, too?

1250
01:36:09,143 --> 01:36:09,443
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1251
01:36:09,503 --> 01:36:12,204
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no ribbon for that, unfortunately, so, you know.

1252
01:36:12,304 --> 01:36:15,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly some controversial opinions in the community.

1253
01:36:15,466 --> 01:36:16,486
[SPEAKER_09]: We look forward to hearing yours.

1254
01:36:16,546 --> 01:36:17,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orange.radio.com.

1255
01:36:17,947 --> 01:36:19,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie will read them all live on air.

1256
01:36:19,908 --> 01:36:21,809
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1257
01:36:21,829 --> 01:36:23,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like she'll read the next story.

1258
01:36:26,117 --> 01:36:35,966
[SPEAKER_03]: The next story is Orange Lounge Radio host Rob Roberts ended up being found in the garbage, chopped to tiny bits, with a I told you so from co-host.

1259
01:36:36,186 --> 01:36:36,847
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sad.

1260
01:36:37,968 --> 01:36:38,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, only to you.

1261
01:36:39,249 --> 01:36:45,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, for our wee friends, who are wee little friends...

1262
01:36:46,355 --> 01:36:57,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are not only virtual console users, but love NEC and Hudson and all the things associated with the PC Engine slash TurboGrafx.

1263
01:36:57,748 --> 01:36:59,730
[SPEAKER_03]: We are getting SuperGrafx games!

1264
01:37:00,291 --> 01:37:03,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to apologize to Bobby for what I...

1265
01:37:04,575 --> 01:37:06,356
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of incorrectness on my comment.

1266
01:37:06,377 --> 01:37:25,971
[SPEAKER_03]: The Super Graphics actually was the successor to the PC Engine, especially the PC Engine Duo with the arcade card units, as 100% backwards compatible and had new Super Hue card games that you could play.

1267
01:37:28,292 --> 01:37:40,657
[SPEAKER_03]: and also these other peripherals that never ended up coming out for it, including a fully functional, well, a full representation of a flight joystick like they've got for, you know, the flight simulators on PC now.

1268
01:37:41,177 --> 01:37:45,358
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, Super Graphics games are going to be coming to Virtual Console.

1269
01:37:45,939 --> 01:37:51,401
[SPEAKER_03]: The first of them being Dai Makai Mura, which was Ghouls and Ghosts.

1270
01:37:52,761 --> 01:38:03,749
[SPEAKER_03]: and honestly I've seen the Super Graphics version of it and it's one of the best ever as far as any type of home system port so I am personally very excited about that.

1271
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:12,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo hasn't announced a US release but there are NEC console and ports on the shop channel so hey.

1272
01:38:14,035 --> 01:38:14,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll be getting it.

1273
01:38:15,275 --> 01:38:16,156
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be pretty cool.

1274
01:38:16,816 --> 01:38:25,577
[SPEAKER_03]: But on top of that, other games that we could be looking forward to that came out on Super Graphics in Japan was 1941 Counter-Attack.

1275
01:38:27,998 --> 01:38:43,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, really, I think that's about all the ones that we're going to know for sure, except for there was a rumor that Strider was, there was a prototype for it, so we could be getting a really good version of Strider if they decided to do a release on that, although the last PC Engine release of that was a

1276
01:38:43,781 --> 01:38:47,085
[SPEAKER_03]: The Arcade Card Version for PC Engine Duo.

1277
01:38:50,008 --> 01:38:50,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited.

1278
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:55,094
[SPEAKER_03]: The Super Graphics... The games were expensive, dude.

1279
01:38:55,114 --> 01:38:59,538
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like $110 a piece for HuCards.

1280
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:04,584
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have done better if it wasn't so expensive.

1281
01:39:07,305 --> 01:39:09,008
[SPEAKER_09]: How many of these are actually out there?

1282
01:39:09,369 --> 01:39:10,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot, right?

1283
01:39:10,130 --> 01:39:12,434
[SPEAKER_03]: There were seven created.

1284
01:39:13,776 --> 01:39:14,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Two were unreleased.

1285
01:39:16,079 --> 01:39:18,102
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them... No, I'm not talking about the games.

1286
01:39:18,122 --> 01:39:19,344
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about the systems itself.

1287
01:39:19,605 --> 01:39:20,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the systems.

1288
01:39:20,266 --> 01:39:21,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's not a lot of them out there, right?

1289
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:24,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Potato, Akihabara, Duo LT

1290
01:39:47,011 --> 01:39:51,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking right now on eBay, just curious what people would charge for these.

1291
01:39:51,035 --> 01:39:54,237
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see one NEC Super Graphic System with Battle Ace.

1292
01:39:54,398 --> 01:39:56,419
[SPEAKER_09]: New, very rare.

1293
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:58,541
[SPEAKER_09]: $89.99, which isn't bad, but there's six days left on it.

1294
01:39:58,601 --> 01:40:00,163
[SPEAKER_09]: So who knows what that's going to look like.

1295
01:40:00,303 --> 01:40:05,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that auction going to about $200, $250, like what this one was.

1296
01:40:05,507 --> 01:40:08,030
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, you can also buy a...

1297
01:40:09,771 --> 01:40:11,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll find out how many of them they produced

1298
01:40:25,407 --> 01:40:38,275
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, anyhow, regardless, you know, it's going to bring a whole, you know, even though I guess not a whole lot of new games, but certainly something that probably a lot of people never have experienced before to the market via virtual console.

1299
01:40:38,295 --> 01:40:39,556
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's neat, I suppose.

1300
01:40:40,917 --> 01:40:42,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you'll be checking out some of these games, DarkSakura.

1301
01:40:44,068 --> 01:40:52,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely interested in getting Daimakai Mora, although, honestly, I have the Saturn release, which was the arcade version.

1302
01:40:53,471 --> 01:41:02,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'd be cool, I mean, to have it on, especially getting that over Super Ghouls N' Ghosts, because, honestly, that game was kind of crap for being in that series.

1303
01:41:03,115 --> 01:41:08,176
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the... Cho Makai Mora was the name for that one, even going by the original name.

1304
01:41:09,237 --> 01:41:09,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1305
01:41:11,618 --> 01:41:17,561
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm checking it out and I don't see exactly how many were made.

1306
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:20,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they should just release all the games at once.

1307
01:41:20,482 --> 01:41:22,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Just have a big Super Graphics week.

1308
01:41:23,023 --> 01:41:24,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I somehow doubt that'll happen.

1309
01:41:25,299 --> 01:41:32,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But it actually seems pretty cool, though, that it used two independently scrolling background layers as far as its graphics.

1310
01:41:32,722 --> 01:41:47,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I put sort of like how the Genesis did, which, you know, was like one of the... In fact, they had a problem with some of the releases of the games for one system versus the other because of if it was a single or dual layer for the app, it had used two video chips.

1311
01:41:47,587 --> 01:41:49,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pretty advanced system for its time.

1312
01:41:49,868 --> 01:41:52,589
[SPEAKER_03]: It just was pretty darn expensive.

1313
01:41:52,609 --> 01:41:52,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1314
01:41:54,147 --> 01:41:58,090
[SPEAKER_09]: FaceDistantChat asks, wait, five games were released for the console.

1315
01:41:58,130 --> 01:42:00,031
[SPEAKER_09]: How long a life could that have on virtual console?

1316
01:42:00,371 --> 01:42:12,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know if it's necessarily about trying to milk the life of the system, but let's face it, Nintendo or the companies behind it share in the profits of however much they're going to charge for each one of these games.

1317
01:42:12,818 --> 01:42:15,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say $7 for each sale.

1318
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:19,562
[SPEAKER_09]: That's $7 they weren't going to get before, especially for a lot of people who have never played.

1319
01:42:19,702 --> 01:42:20,402
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1320
01:42:35,251 --> 01:42:35,591
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1321
01:42:56,189 --> 01:42:56,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Pippin

1322
01:43:15,885 --> 01:43:16,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about that, but...

1323
01:43:36,738 --> 01:43:39,439
[SPEAKER_08]: A plethora of other awesome animated films.

1324
01:43:39,799 --> 01:43:42,380
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be doing the animation for that title as well.

1325
01:43:44,141 --> 01:43:48,343
[SPEAKER_08]: To make the game unique, it will come with a Magic Master Book.

1326
01:43:48,923 --> 01:43:54,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that will be shared by the main character of the game, which needs to be referred to while playing the game.

1327
01:43:57,527 --> 01:43:59,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, they will be making a console version at some point.

1328
01:44:01,038 --> 01:44:01,739
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool.

1329
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:07,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to see some pretty solid animated games coming to the DS.

1330
01:44:08,344 --> 01:44:10,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Have we had a new Studio Ghibli movie in a while?

1331
01:44:11,366 --> 01:44:11,927
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't seen one.

1332
01:44:11,947 --> 01:44:15,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought there was a new one coming.

1333
01:44:15,129 --> 01:44:17,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought there was one that was coming out this year or something.

1334
01:44:17,712 --> 01:44:18,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I just haven't heard much of it.

1335
01:44:18,612 --> 01:44:20,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it already came out in Japan and it's not out here yet.

1336
01:44:20,894 --> 01:44:30,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't, ever since I got out of the movie department, and, you know, I haven't really been paying attention to what new movies are coming out from that studio, so, uh, yeah.

1337
01:44:30,802 --> 01:44:33,244
[SPEAKER_08]: But all of them are gold, I mean, seriously.

1338
01:44:33,524 --> 01:44:34,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're good movies.

1339
01:44:35,185 --> 01:44:40,610
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very curious to see what kind of game comes out of this, because it could either be really good or just one of those things that looks good on paper.

1340
01:44:42,074 --> 01:44:44,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Level 5 is not stopping there with that partnership.

1341
01:44:44,176 --> 01:44:47,718
[SPEAKER_09]: They are also going to be making some new games for the PSP.

1342
01:44:48,558 --> 01:44:51,420
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't really have anything to do with the Studio Ghibli project.

1343
01:44:51,721 --> 01:44:54,963
[SPEAKER_09]: However, they are doing some other games on the PSP.

1344
01:44:55,103 --> 01:44:57,204
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them is called Ushiro.

1345
01:44:58,045 --> 01:45:01,287
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a scary RPG, if you want to say, for the PSP.

1346
01:45:02,027 --> 01:45:05,250
[SPEAKER_09]: You will actually kind of play as a Shingami.

1347
01:45:05,310 --> 01:45:07,751
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a god of death in Japanese lore.

1348
01:45:08,412 --> 01:45:11,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And you will fight monsters and also grant people's wishes.

1349
01:45:12,114 --> 01:45:15,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Dambol Senki Cardboard War Machine RPG Projects for the PSP coming from level 5

1350
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:37,204
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1351
01:45:59,246 --> 01:46:00,848
[SPEAKER_08]: No more ports on the PSP!

1352
01:46:02,749 --> 01:46:04,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they actually kind of port it in reverse a lot of times.

1353
01:46:04,890 --> 01:46:06,451
[SPEAKER_08]: They port PSP games to PS2.

1354
01:46:06,872 --> 01:46:08,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I kind of thought that was interesting.

1355
01:46:08,072 --> 01:46:09,894
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't want ports on the PSP.

1356
01:46:11,595 --> 01:46:13,696
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm thinking, well, they've still got some big sellers.

1357
01:46:13,736 --> 01:46:16,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Puzzle Quest would be a port that's a big sell, right?

1358
01:46:16,899 --> 01:46:17,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would you want to say no to that?

1359
01:46:17,899 --> 01:46:21,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think they were looking for games that are developed specifically for the PSP.

1360
01:46:21,962 --> 01:46:25,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a lot of the games that come out, the PSP version isn't exactly that strong.

1361
01:46:26,445 --> 01:46:40,735
[SPEAKER_08]: and so it's making the console look kind of weak but I think they need I don't know it's like a double edged sword there they need more units to be sold so more publishers get interested in it but they need more publishers interested in it so they can get more units sold

1362
01:46:41,656 --> 01:46:44,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Before DarkSakura gets to the next story, I got the answer to the question I was looking for.

1363
01:46:44,459 --> 01:46:50,664
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea just came out from Studio Ghibli.

1364
01:46:51,105 --> 01:46:54,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought I heard something about that that was the name of the new movie.

1365
01:46:54,387 --> 01:46:56,529
[SPEAKER_09]: But correct me if I'm wrong, it's only out in Japan, right?

1366
01:46:56,549 --> 01:47:00,253
[SPEAKER_09]: It hasn't come out here because Disney has to do their thing with the translation and all that.

1367
01:47:00,573 --> 01:47:03,876
[SPEAKER_09]: We probably won't see it until early next year, probably.

1368
01:47:06,038 --> 01:47:07,459
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we can move on with gaming news.

1369
01:47:08,099 --> 01:47:08,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, DarkSakura?

1370
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:09,960
[SPEAKER_03]: That we can.

1371
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:14,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is some news for City of Heroes.

1372
01:47:14,402 --> 01:47:16,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there are plenty of people who still play that.

1373
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:23,385
[SPEAKER_03]: That the mission editor is actually going to be delayed.

1374
01:47:23,586 --> 01:47:27,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So now issue 13 is to be retitled Power and Responsibility.

1375
01:47:27,727 --> 01:47:28,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1376
01:47:30,048 --> 01:47:39,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else was supposed to come out with the architect mode and an extension for the sidekick buddy system that's a leveling pact.

1377
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:46,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically it lets you and your friends synchronize your experience so that you're always at the same level.

1378
01:47:48,535 --> 01:47:50,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if one person plays more than the other.

1379
01:47:50,556 --> 01:47:54,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can play together more on an even keel.

1380
01:47:54,457 --> 01:47:55,058
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of cool.

1381
01:47:55,878 --> 01:48:00,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there's multi-builds, so you can keep two different versions of the same character.

1382
01:48:01,723 --> 01:48:07,027
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also day jobs, power sets, and merit rewards will be included as well.

1383
01:48:07,067 --> 01:48:10,530
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say that the architect, mission, editor will be coming out later.

1384
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:19,177
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, part of the thing in it is supposed to let you create your own NPCs for those missions.

1385
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:20,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

1386
01:48:21,259 --> 01:48:21,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

1387
01:48:23,141 --> 01:48:23,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Well,

1388
01:48:23,826 --> 01:48:24,527
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1389
01:48:41,926 --> 01:48:49,754
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, Punisher will be getting not only a new movie this year, but a new game thanks to the PlayStation Network.

1390
01:48:50,415 --> 01:49:00,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Punisher No Mercy is exclusive to the PlayStation Network and will be coming to us from Zen Studios, who unfortunately don't have much of a...

1391
01:49:02,521 --> 01:49:10,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, resume, but, uh, Rocky and Bullwinkle, the Xbox Live Arcade game, and the new Mushroom Man game, which look kind of, eh, alright.

1392
01:49:10,926 --> 01:49:11,567
[SPEAKER_08]: But who knows?

1393
01:49:11,627 --> 01:49:13,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe this is the, uh, Diamond in the Rough.

1394
01:49:14,048 --> 01:49:22,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it will be powered by the Unreal 3 engine, and of course we'll follow, uh, you know, Frank Castle as he seeks revenge.

1395
01:49:23,314 --> 01:49:26,716
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, they've got some screenshots out for the game so far.

1396
01:49:26,756 --> 01:49:27,776
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually looks pretty good.

1397
01:49:28,457 --> 01:49:30,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no word on how it's gonna play.

1398
01:49:30,818 --> 01:49:31,118
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um...

1399
01:49:32,557 --> 01:49:38,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently also, I guess, I don't know.

1400
01:49:38,558 --> 01:49:40,739
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no word on when exactly it's going to be released.

1401
01:49:40,779 --> 01:49:42,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I would imagine maybe around the time of the film.

1402
01:49:44,259 --> 01:49:45,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's what it says.

1403
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:49,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Aiming to release the game in line with the new Punisher film.

1404
01:49:50,281 --> 01:49:56,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And it will include both single and multiplayer modes as well, character customizations and trophies.

1405
01:49:58,678 --> 01:50:00,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did everyone hate Rocky and Bullwinkle?

1406
01:50:24,338 --> 01:50:29,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, the fun factor was kind of missing from that game, especially for something so nostalgic.

1407
01:50:30,281 --> 01:50:32,262
[SPEAKER_09]: The game just kind of felt cheap to me.

1408
01:50:34,062 --> 01:50:38,484
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really hard to put my finger on it, but it just kind of felt like it wasn't any fun.

1409
01:50:38,964 --> 01:50:45,207
[SPEAKER_09]: The minigames were kind of like they might make you smile for a second, but then you're like, I can't see myself playing this again.

1410
01:50:45,227 --> 01:50:46,568
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have been a better game on the Wii.

1411
01:50:47,228 --> 01:50:47,589
[SPEAKER_09]: You think?

1412
01:50:48,249 --> 01:50:49,291
[SPEAKER_09]: With the motion control and everything?

1413
01:50:49,451 --> 01:50:49,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1414
01:50:50,332 --> 01:50:56,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just the Wii seems to be the party game machine, but at the same time it's getting overkill with that stuff.

1415
01:50:56,499 --> 01:50:58,702
[SPEAKER_08]: That genre is way too much on there.

1416
01:50:59,162 --> 01:51:07,132
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like if you want to call the Xbox 360 a first person shooter console, then the Wii is definitely the party game console.

1417
01:51:09,281 --> 01:51:10,563
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, moving on.

1418
01:51:10,763 --> 01:51:15,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is going to, you know, our longtime fans, you know, because I think we mentioned this quite often.

1419
01:51:15,128 --> 01:51:17,431
[SPEAKER_09]: We had started originally way back on episode one.

1420
01:51:17,471 --> 01:51:25,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a show really revolving around music-based video games, and especially DDR was a big focus of this game, of that era of Orange Launch Radio.

1421
01:51:26,222 --> 01:51:36,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure a lot of our listeners who remember that still follow what goes on in the DDR world are going to find this news very interesting because it isn't about DDR, but a possible new competitor to DDR.

1422
01:51:37,149 --> 01:51:42,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot is known about it, but we do know that a patent has been filed with the official U.S.

1423
01:51:42,272 --> 01:51:47,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Patent and Trademark Office by Activision for a game called Dance Hero.

1424
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:51,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero, Dance Hero, Video Game Controllers

1425
01:52:18,792 --> 01:52:20,613
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1426
01:52:35,262 --> 01:52:54,857
[SPEAKER_09]: and rebuild the game from the ground up and in a way I think that's exactly what's going to happen here with what Activision is doing is that they're going to take a dance game concept and rebuild it from the ground up so that could be very interesting and I'm not ready to scream theft just yet because I have a feeling this could be something kind of new and innovative

1427
01:52:56,254 --> 01:52:56,714
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1428
01:52:57,034 --> 01:52:57,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1429
01:52:57,355 --> 01:52:57,855
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

1430
01:52:58,235 --> 01:52:59,135
[SPEAKER_08]: New and innovative.

1431
01:52:59,756 --> 01:53:07,199
[SPEAKER_08]: From a company who ripped off Guitar Freak's Drum Mania and beat Mania.

1432
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:08,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Might make it better.

1433
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:09,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Might make it better.

1434
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,821
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, I don't think they're really going to change it.

1435
01:53:10,921 --> 01:53:19,766
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably going to look like a guitar hero type of game, but instead of maybe notes scrolling down the screen, it's going to be arrows or steps or feet or something.

1436
01:53:19,786 --> 01:53:20,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1437
01:53:20,686 --> 01:53:21,386
[SPEAKER_08]: To that effect.

1438
01:53:21,947 --> 01:53:22,167
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1439
01:53:25,146 --> 01:53:26,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I hear you.

1440
01:53:26,488 --> 01:53:28,991
[SPEAKER_09]: They're whoring the brand to death, seriously.

1441
01:53:29,311 --> 01:53:30,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, right.

1442
01:53:30,292 --> 01:53:36,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see all those concerns, but at the same time, I kind of feel like, oh, somebody might be finally reinventing the approach to the dance game.

1443
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:40,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Because let's face it, every other dance game that's come out in the groove...

1444
01:53:41,765 --> 01:53:44,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the, the, what am I thinking of?

1445
01:53:44,586 --> 01:53:49,488
[SPEAKER_09]: The freaking game that you can use your own CDs on that was terrible on the PS2?

1446
01:53:49,988 --> 01:53:50,668
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell was that game?

1447
01:53:50,688 --> 01:53:51,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Dance Factory.

1448
01:53:52,229 --> 01:53:53,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Factory or whatever, yeah, Dance Factory or whatever.

1449
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:56,130
[SPEAKER_09]: They've all pretty much been the same damn thing.

1450
01:53:56,190 --> 01:53:57,711
[SPEAKER_09]: It's four arrows that you stomp to.

1451
01:53:58,703 --> 01:54:00,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe this could be something different.

1452
01:54:16,397 --> 01:54:18,819
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Hero sounds like guitar hero, but exchange the guitar for a DJ turntable.

1453
01:54:18,839 --> 01:54:22,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if you could use the DJ turntable in your game.

1454
01:54:37,817 --> 01:54:40,738
[SPEAKER_08]: and Guitar Hero because it probably is just another controller.

1455
01:54:41,159 --> 01:54:46,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of the strum bar, it's scratching and instead of the fret buttons, it's keys.

1456
01:54:46,481 --> 01:54:47,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

1457
01:54:47,602 --> 01:54:50,043
[SPEAKER_08]: So much innovation, it blows my mind!

1458
01:54:51,263 --> 01:54:54,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Will I be able to get Star Power 2 by shaking the turntable?

1459
01:54:54,585 --> 01:54:57,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, maybe I'll have a crossfader for that, you know?

1460
01:54:57,986 --> 01:54:58,527
[SPEAKER_08]: God!

1461
01:54:59,567 --> 01:55:00,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1462
01:55:00,568 --> 01:55:01,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not interested.

1463
01:55:01,228 --> 01:55:02,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bet you, you know what?

1464
01:55:02,368 --> 01:55:02,729
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why?

1465
01:55:06,988 --> 01:55:14,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they have Guitar Hero behind them, and they have these games behind them, they're going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted for DDR.

1466
01:55:14,874 --> 01:55:17,596
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not going to have to fill up a song list with originals.

1467
01:55:17,716 --> 01:55:24,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, we as DDR fans have come to know and love those Konami originals, but it's part of the reason why the game didn't sell as well over here.

1468
01:55:24,821 --> 01:55:27,363
[SPEAKER_09]: They're having to rely on a lot of Japan-centric songs.

1469
01:55:27,724 --> 01:55:31,106
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted in DDR.

1470
01:55:31,446 --> 01:55:31,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And they know it.

1471
01:55:32,367 --> 01:55:33,229
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1472
01:55:40,626 --> 01:55:42,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Speculation Speculation

1473
01:56:09,167 --> 01:56:09,407
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

1474
01:56:09,627 --> 01:56:10,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all speculation.

1475
01:56:11,048 --> 01:56:11,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Track record.

1476
01:56:11,909 --> 01:56:13,150
[SPEAKER_08]: They hoard this thing.

1477
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:16,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God, they hoard this thing so bad.

1478
01:56:16,912 --> 01:56:24,277
[SPEAKER_08]: You watch next year when Guitar Hero has four to six game releases and people are going, my God.

1479
01:56:24,697 --> 01:56:30,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero... Five cents.

1480
01:56:30,461 --> 01:56:30,941
[SPEAKER_09]: No, more than that.

1481
01:56:31,041 --> 01:56:36,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero will sell more copies than Beat Mania did here in this country.

1482
01:56:36,425 --> 01:56:38,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can guarantee that will happen.

1483
01:56:38,866 --> 01:56:44,310
[SPEAKER_09]: and I don't know if I can make the same thing for Dance Hero because, you know, it has done very, very well.

1484
01:56:44,350 --> 01:56:46,011
[SPEAKER_08]: But DJ Hero will sell by its name alone.

1485
01:56:46,251 --> 01:56:49,333
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be the worst game ever, but people go, oh my god, I want to be a DJ.

1486
01:56:49,393 --> 01:56:50,974
[SPEAKER_09]: But what if it's not bad?

1487
01:56:51,695 --> 01:56:53,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying DJ Hero will be bad.

1488
01:56:54,116 --> 01:56:55,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying Dance Hero will be bad.

1489
01:56:55,778 --> 01:56:56,558
[SPEAKER_03]: What if it's not?

1490
01:56:56,918 --> 01:56:57,899
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna suck.

1491
01:56:58,159 --> 01:56:59,120
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna suck.

1492
01:56:59,260 --> 01:56:59,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1493
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Big time.

1494
01:57:01,301 --> 01:57:07,404
[SPEAKER_03]: If it sells more than... Okay, how many copies of Guitar Hero, the first Guitar Hero sold?

1495
01:57:07,704 --> 01:57:08,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't know.

1496
01:57:09,185 --> 01:57:11,586
[SPEAKER_03]: During its first month of release.

1497
01:57:12,646 --> 01:57:13,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Not enough until it went on 360.

1498
01:57:14,127 --> 01:57:15,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think.

1499
01:57:16,408 --> 01:57:19,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, plus they had to get the first game out there to license the songs everybody wanted to play.

1500
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:27,053
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter anyways, because this game will never... So, say that it sells more in its first month than Guitar Hero did...

1501
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:33,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Dance Hero will not sell more than Guitar Hero did in its first month.

1502
01:57:33,382 --> 01:57:37,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you bet you're... Oh, oh, oh, no, I disagree, sir.

1503
01:57:37,185 --> 01:57:38,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a bet forming here.

1504
01:57:39,026 --> 01:57:40,727
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there is not a bet forming here.

1505
01:57:40,807 --> 01:57:43,849
[SPEAKER_08]: The only bet is the Eye of Judgment, okay?

1506
01:57:44,049 --> 01:57:45,550
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just a registered trademark.

1507
01:57:45,570 --> 01:57:47,171
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know what this is at all.

1508
01:57:47,431 --> 01:57:51,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So why are you thinking that it's going to... Because I saw the Eye of Judgment.

1509
01:57:51,854 --> 01:57:53,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, wow, that is a piece of shit.

1510
01:57:53,815 --> 01:57:55,296
[SPEAKER_03]: But you haven't seen Dance Hero.

1511
01:57:55,316 --> 01:57:56,657
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the point of this game?

1512
01:57:56,957 --> 01:57:57,477
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1513
01:58:19,008 --> 01:58:25,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we can go ahead and take the devil's advocate thing, but the fact of the matter is they need a peripheral with every one of these fucking hero games.

1514
01:58:25,395 --> 01:58:28,118
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is the magic peripheral that's going to come along with this?

1515
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:31,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And really, is it going to innovate anything other than having a better song list?

1516
01:58:34,878 --> 01:58:35,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1517
01:58:55,114 --> 01:58:55,895
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, though?

1518
01:58:56,615 --> 01:58:57,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's a matter of time.

1519
01:58:57,416 --> 01:58:58,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Track record is two words.

1520
01:58:58,817 --> 01:59:00,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Speculation is one word.

1521
01:59:00,178 --> 01:59:01,500
[SPEAKER_00]: You were supposed to sum it up in one word.

1522
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:04,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, you are disqualified and your opinion is thrown out.

1523
01:59:05,343 --> 01:59:06,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I make my own damn rules.

1524
01:59:07,805 --> 01:59:10,628
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay because we're entitled to make our own rules and change them at will.

1525
01:59:13,290 --> 01:59:13,831
[SPEAKER_03]: You lose.

1526
01:59:14,311 --> 01:59:19,015
[SPEAKER_03]: A man will never win an argument with a woman because we're awesome and men aren't.

1527
01:59:19,195 --> 01:59:19,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1528
01:59:19,435 --> 01:59:19,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

1529
01:59:19,816 --> 01:59:20,396
[SPEAKER_03]: You should know that.

1530
01:59:20,416 --> 01:59:21,017
[SPEAKER_03]: You're married.

1531
01:59:21,037 --> 01:59:21,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1532
01:59:21,657 --> 01:59:22,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1533
01:59:25,194 --> 01:59:28,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Nelly, if you're listening, come up here and lay down the law.

1534
01:59:29,156 --> 01:59:29,516
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1535
01:59:30,797 --> 01:59:31,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1536
01:59:31,157 --> 01:59:32,098
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1537
01:59:32,118 --> 01:59:32,538
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1538
01:59:33,018 --> 01:59:33,398
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1539
01:59:33,498 --> 01:59:34,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of good, you know what?

1540
01:59:35,259 --> 01:59:39,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether you agree with Loki or not, you know, lots of good points being brought up around the board.

1541
01:59:39,341 --> 01:59:41,422
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure we're going to have some calls on it later as well.

1542
01:59:41,782 --> 01:59:48,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, no offense to Dan's here, but I think the logical step for them would be to do like a keyboard hero because that's at least something you can add.

1543
01:59:48,446 --> 01:59:49,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we haven't had keyboard mania.

1544
01:59:49,706 --> 01:59:50,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1545
01:59:51,247 --> 01:59:52,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we haven't had DDR either.

1546
01:59:53,028 --> 01:59:56,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, fuck Konami with a big chainsaw for disbanding that series.

1547
01:59:56,591 --> 01:59:57,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, Keyboard Mania was fantastic.

1548
01:59:57,852 --> 02:00:00,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Keyboard Mania I was actually pretty good at.

1549
02:00:00,354 --> 02:00:02,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is in charge of the DDR series now?

1550
02:00:02,815 --> 02:00:04,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it like on autopilot or something?

1551
02:00:04,537 --> 02:00:06,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I mean, what is seriously happening?

1552
02:00:07,519 --> 02:00:19,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do think they should bring a keyboard thing out because in that way you can add it to Guitar Hero World Tour You can have keyboards with a lot of stuff Who doesn't want to play Van Halen's Jump?

1553
02:00:19,888 --> 02:00:28,214
[SPEAKER_09]: We need sax maniacs This is going to lead to Bagpipe Hero and Didgeridoo Hero Sitar Hero Let's move on

1554
02:00:30,697 --> 02:00:32,818
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and reads a few of her favorites.

1555
02:00:57,570 --> 02:00:58,655
[SPEAKER_09]: After she drinks some soda.

1556
02:00:59,278 --> 02:01:00,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the music's playing.

1557
02:01:00,222 --> 02:01:00,805
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we going to do?

1558
02:01:00,846 --> 02:01:01,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Just sit here and wait?

1559
02:01:02,182 --> 02:01:04,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can stare at the ants.

1560
02:01:04,864 --> 02:01:05,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there more ants now?

1561
02:01:05,884 --> 02:01:08,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but they're attacking something on the floor and I don't really know what.

1562
02:01:08,186 --> 02:01:09,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw like a trail of them.

1563
02:01:09,927 --> 02:01:10,608
[SPEAKER_08]: They're running over there.

1564
02:01:10,748 --> 02:01:11,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm off to get the raid.

1565
02:01:11,949 --> 02:01:13,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I can't because I don't smell like raid in here.

1566
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:14,490
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it.

1567
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:16,452
[SPEAKER_09]: How about a fire?

1568
02:01:16,472 --> 02:01:17,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Email time.

1569
02:01:17,572 --> 02:01:19,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's set fire to the floor and burn all the ants.

1570
02:01:19,934 --> 02:01:24,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever watch that YouTube video of the guy burning the hornet's nest on his child's swing set?

1571
02:01:24,537 --> 02:01:25,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

1572
02:01:25,398 --> 02:01:28,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Setting it on fire with as many different flammable things as he could find.

1573
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:29,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, stupid.

1574
02:01:30,121 --> 02:01:31,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'll be looking that up right now.

1575
02:01:32,983 --> 02:01:33,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1576
02:01:33,424 --> 02:01:34,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Setting fire to swing set.

1577
02:01:34,525 --> 02:01:36,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Look up fucking moron and you'll find him.

1578
02:01:36,888 --> 02:01:38,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that could be a ton of videos on there.

1579
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:39,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta look fire swing set.

1580
02:01:40,132 --> 02:01:40,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1581
02:01:40,853 --> 02:01:43,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fire and hornets, but anyway.

1582
02:01:43,316 --> 02:01:47,181
[SPEAKER_03]: First email comes from Hunter Red, aka Redertainment.

1583
02:01:47,902 --> 02:01:48,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, y'all.

1584
02:01:50,205 --> 02:01:52,686
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can't say y'all without saying it in accent.

1585
02:01:53,106 --> 02:01:53,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all.

1586
02:01:54,407 --> 02:02:01,470
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, the season where the masses choose which douchebag will represent them is upon us and I have a question to that end.

1587
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:13,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to send an email to all the douchebags running for Congress in my district and I want to ask them how they feel about video games and the legislation that is currently pending about them.

1588
02:02:13,835 --> 02:02:18,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a way I should phrase my email so that I can get a response from them other than not calling them douchebags?

1589
02:02:18,537 --> 02:02:19,498
[SPEAKER_08]: That's gonna smell, man.

1590
02:02:22,102 --> 02:02:22,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have done it.

1591
02:02:24,264 --> 02:02:24,924
[SPEAKER_08]: But it'll smell.

1592
02:02:25,965 --> 02:02:29,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that because I would have done it.

1593
02:02:30,228 --> 02:02:36,033
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Sky, that means you, Mr. I've-left-the-studio-try-to-set-fire-to-the-ant.

1594
02:02:36,073 --> 02:02:36,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I was getting fire.

1595
02:02:38,435 --> 02:02:43,378
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Sky, if you hate the influence of the Mormon church and politics in California, you should come to Utah.

1596
02:02:43,619 --> 02:02:45,220
[SPEAKER_03]: They're everywhere and are everything.

1597
02:02:46,522 --> 02:02:59,487
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I've heard about Utah, and it's, you know, it's just, you know, you guys, if you listened to the show last week, you already know how I feel about Proposition 8 and how it's, you know, setting civil rights back about 50 years, but, you know, what can you do?

1598
02:02:59,867 --> 02:03:04,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, if you want to see the influence of the Mormon church, just go talk to a, you know, Boy Scout troop.

1599
02:03:07,210 --> 02:03:12,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, love the show, you do what I ask for any podcasts I listen to, work to do, inform, entertain, and make me laugh.

1600
02:03:12,833 --> 02:03:14,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again, Hunter Red, a.k.a.

1601
02:03:14,954 --> 02:03:15,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Redertainment.

1602
02:03:16,291 --> 02:03:16,831
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

1603
02:03:18,292 --> 02:03:18,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one?

1604
02:03:19,732 --> 02:03:19,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1605
02:03:20,553 --> 02:03:21,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys.

1606
02:03:22,333 --> 02:03:25,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan Shadow here with your helpful hints for Warhammer Online.

1607
02:03:26,435 --> 02:03:30,437
[SPEAKER_03]: There are thousands of tome unlocks and hundreds of titles you can earn.

1608
02:03:30,777 --> 02:03:33,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to help you get some of the nicer title unlocks.

1609
02:03:34,338 --> 02:03:35,579
[SPEAKER_03]: First, take off all your clothes.

1610
02:03:37,125 --> 02:03:40,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, use 100 abilities to be known as the show-off.

1611
02:03:41,147 --> 02:03:44,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Third, talk to 100 citizens while naked to be a flirt.

1612
02:03:45,229 --> 02:03:48,531
[SPEAKER_03]: If you target another naked player 100 times, you'll become the ogler.

1613
02:03:49,371 --> 02:03:53,533
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get a nice title that doesn't involve nudity, then jump off a cliff and die.

1614
02:03:54,174 --> 02:03:57,716
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do this 25 times, you can have the word AHHHHH floating above your head.

1615
02:03:59,076 --> 02:04:00,657
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the helpful hints for this week.

1616
02:04:01,017 --> 02:04:05,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got into the LittleBigPlanet beta, so I'll let you guys know how that one goes when I can.

1617
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:05,920
[SPEAKER_03]: See ya!

1618
02:04:07,219 --> 02:04:09,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to be in the little big planet beta so that I don't even have a PS3.

1619
02:04:09,962 --> 02:04:12,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want a key to say I'm in it and you're not.

1620
02:04:12,405 --> 02:04:15,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be in a game and have, ah, floating over my head.

1621
02:04:15,849 --> 02:04:17,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Or remember there was Impossible Mission.

1622
02:04:18,292 --> 02:04:20,454
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge.

1623
02:04:20,574 --> 02:04:21,535
[SPEAKER_09]: No, OLR's not over.

1624
02:04:21,615 --> 02:04:21,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1625
02:04:23,778 --> 02:04:24,659
[SPEAKER_09]: And the show's canceled.

1626
02:04:24,699 --> 02:04:25,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night, everyone.

1627
02:04:26,561 --> 02:04:27,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

1628
02:04:28,604 --> 02:04:34,668
[SPEAKER_03]: My question for OLR this week is, do you guys have a backlog of video games to play slash finish and how large is the backlog?

1629
02:04:34,748 --> 02:04:36,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit, you really want me to answer that?

1630
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:41,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I have a backlog on PS2 and even on the Xbox 360, which I only purchased a couple months ago.

1631
02:04:42,133 --> 02:04:44,575
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority are some RPGs and some action games.

1632
02:04:44,895 --> 02:04:50,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that DDR and World of Warcraft sometimes eat up a lot of my free time, but I'm not sure what stops me from finishing some games.

1633
02:04:51,179 --> 02:04:55,702
[SPEAKER_03]: As promised, Triple A to an old school DDR song, Burn in the Floor, in honor of OLR and 300th show.

1634
02:04:58,243 --> 02:04:59,564
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually sent a picture of it too.

1635
02:05:00,064 --> 02:05:02,985
[SPEAKER_03]: This email is brought to you by DarkSakura School of Dancing Ferrets.

1636
02:05:03,045 --> 02:05:04,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out and AAA Jammer Jones.

1637
02:05:05,926 --> 02:05:10,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Off the top of my head, Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, Final Fantasy XII.

1638
02:05:11,227 --> 02:05:13,168
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all games I need to... Kingdom Hearts 2.

1639
02:05:13,248 --> 02:05:14,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit, I never finished that one.

1640
02:05:14,268 --> 02:05:15,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I got really far but I didn't finish it.

1641
02:05:15,969 --> 02:05:17,009
[SPEAKER_09]: There's tons of games I need to finish.

1642
02:05:17,089 --> 02:05:18,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a gaming ADD.

1643
02:05:18,129 --> 02:05:19,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I've said it a million times on this show.

1644
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:21,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially this time of year.

1645
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:22,790
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge ass freaking picture.

1646
02:05:22,871 --> 02:05:23,831
[SPEAKER_09]: How can you play...

1647
02:05:24,711 --> 02:05:26,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one game this time of year.

1648
02:05:26,394 --> 02:05:30,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like every week leading up to Christmas, there's a new freaking game coming out that I have to play.

1649
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:35,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Fable 2 is coming out soon, and I barely have touched Warhammer, Spore even.

1650
02:05:35,346 --> 02:05:37,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've sunk maybe five hours into Spore, tops.

1651
02:05:38,150 --> 02:05:39,632
[SPEAKER_09]: And already there's new games coming out I want.

1652
02:05:40,385 --> 02:05:41,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1653
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:15,366
[SPEAKER_09]: and a perfect score I'll tell you the big one here's the big one Strong Bad, the episodic Strong Bad's games I freaking know people that have worked on those games and I keep saying I'm going to support them and I want to play the games I haven't even touched them yet just because there's been so much else that have been grabbing my attention but I really do want to play the Strong Bad games at some point

1654
02:06:15,686 --> 02:06:18,987
[SPEAKER_03]: My present backlog is I actually do want to go back and finish Kingdom Hearts 2.

1655
02:06:19,707 --> 02:06:30,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually never finished Final Fantasy X because I got so pissed off that I had rushed through leveling the game that I got to one of the battles with What's-His-Stupid-Face with his ugly blue hair.

1656
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:35,612
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to the Glyph Mine battle past that and none of my characters were high enough to stand one hit.

1657
02:06:36,232 --> 02:06:37,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my own bad.

1658
02:06:37,952 --> 02:06:38,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And I...

1659
02:06:41,147 --> 02:06:44,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to finish Kingdom Hearts 2, but I glitched the game in a major way.

1660
02:06:45,692 --> 02:06:45,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1661
02:06:46,333 --> 02:06:50,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I skipped some level, and now I can't get into doing the Pride Lands.

1662
02:06:51,058 --> 02:06:52,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty stupid.

1663
02:06:53,441 --> 02:06:55,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I did Halloween Town twice in a row or something.

1664
02:06:56,144 --> 02:06:56,284
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

1665
02:06:57,325 --> 02:06:57,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

1666
02:06:57,886 --> 02:06:58,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

1667
02:07:20,305 --> 02:07:37,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering and I just started listening to the podcast so I'm not certain if you guys have talked about this what you guys thought about the makers of Psychonauts making a sequel seeing as how I think it was rated as 14th greatest Xbox even though it wasn't a great seller to my knowledge Xbox Live Gamer Tag Quick Sticks

1668
02:07:39,289 --> 02:07:40,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent question.

1669
02:07:41,810 --> 02:07:43,411
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another one of those games I didn't play a lot of.

1670
02:07:43,431 --> 02:07:46,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I have played Psychonauts, just not a lot in depth.

1671
02:07:47,652 --> 02:07:49,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see how it's a bad thing, though.

1672
02:07:49,553 --> 02:07:55,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Psychonauts had a lot of fans, and a lot of people have been slowly discovering that game over the years.

1673
02:07:55,535 --> 02:07:57,776
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like a cult game, like a cult movie.

1674
02:07:58,236 --> 02:08:01,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot of people see it when it first comes out, but it sells really well on DVD.

1675
02:08:01,897 --> 02:08:03,158
[SPEAKER_09]: People want to go back and check it out later.

1676
02:08:03,178 --> 02:08:03,878
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of what Psychonauts is.

1677
02:08:03,898 --> 02:08:08,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those games that people get together and sacrifice virgins on altars in the basement of their building.

1678
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:09,580
[SPEAKER_09]: and Drink the Kool-Aid.

1679
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:10,561
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not that kind of game.

1680
02:08:11,081 --> 02:08:18,264
[SPEAKER_09]: But I didn't play enough of the first one to really say, oh, I'm excited about a sequel.

1681
02:08:18,644 --> 02:08:24,266
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know that the first game was unique enough with a cool sense of humor about it that I think a second game will be welcome.

1682
02:08:24,306 --> 02:08:26,467
[SPEAKER_09]: And I bet you more people check out the sequel than the first one.

1683
02:08:27,047 --> 02:08:32,850
[SPEAKER_09]: And making a sequel, honestly, will get more people to check out the original, which is available as an Xbox Live original, if I'm not mistaken.

1684
02:08:35,278 --> 02:08:57,429
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our listeners, I guess, I'm not ever quite sure how to pronounce it, but I think it's Nige, but anyway, one of our British listeners saw a story on the BBC News website and linked it to us, which is a Germany arrest over gamer death where a man is arrested in Germany on suspicion of the murder of a 20-year-old internet gamer in Nottingham.

1685
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:02,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking out the article as soon as it loads up.

1686
02:09:04,921 --> 02:09:11,548
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll link the article in the chat room since it's very nice to share that with us as soon as the damn thing loads.

1687
02:09:12,609 --> 02:09:19,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Matthew Pike, 20, was found stabbed in his flat above the Orange Tree Pub on North Sherwood Street on Friday.

1688
02:09:19,856 --> 02:09:24,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So the one arrested was a guy from Lindbergh and

1689
02:09:26,282 --> 02:09:29,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So does that mean if you can't beat them, you should gank them?

1690
02:09:29,423 --> 02:09:29,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1691
02:09:56,287 --> 02:09:57,668
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you for sharing that with us.

1692
02:09:58,389 --> 02:10:06,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Cheeseburger, somebody go smack Cheeseburger around with the large trout in the chat room for me, because the email was dongle.

1693
02:10:08,198 --> 02:10:08,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1694
02:10:10,711 --> 02:10:11,412
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1695
02:10:26,781 --> 02:10:27,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Last email.

1696
02:10:28,182 --> 02:10:30,484
[SPEAKER_03]: This comes from Isabel.

1697
02:10:30,945 --> 02:10:34,348
[SPEAKER_03]: These are just some photos me and my friend took for Pyramid Head Day.

1698
02:10:34,828 --> 02:10:39,893
[SPEAKER_03]: We made cupcakes with little Pyramid Head heads on top of them and I made a Pyramid Head costume.

1699
02:10:40,213 --> 02:10:41,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Pyramid Head Day.

1700
02:10:41,414 --> 02:10:43,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope Silent Hill Homecoming is awesome.

1701
02:10:43,436 --> 02:10:46,799
[SPEAKER_03]: But none of you get to see them because I haven't actually uploaded them anywhere.

1702
02:10:46,819 --> 02:10:48,360
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on our email.

1703
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:52,804
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are funny and cute and Pyramid Head is tasty delicious.

1704
02:10:57,657 --> 02:10:58,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray for Peahitty Day.

1705
02:10:58,357 --> 02:11:02,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm really glad that people actually went and celebrated Pyramid Head Day.

1706
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:03,881
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wonderful.

1707
02:11:04,101 --> 02:11:06,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope we get more pictures over the coming weeks.

1708
02:11:06,602 --> 02:11:07,523
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Peahitty Day.

1709
02:11:07,763 --> 02:11:08,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Peahitty Day.

1710
02:11:08,943 --> 02:11:10,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Vote or Peahitty will kill you.

1711
02:11:11,685 --> 02:11:12,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1712
02:11:12,325 --> 02:11:14,306
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for email.

1713
02:11:14,447 --> 02:11:14,667
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1714
02:11:14,707 --> 02:11:18,649
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to send us an email next time, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

1715
02:11:19,346 --> 02:11:19,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Bungie

1716
02:11:43,723 --> 02:11:49,068
[SPEAKER_08]: The game developer believes that game companies should pocket money from used game sales.

1717
02:11:49,948 --> 02:11:59,436
[SPEAKER_08]: And it seems, I guess, that they feel since the used sales, like for example, had a big impact on Halo.

1718
02:12:00,096 --> 02:12:06,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you have a multi-million dollar seller game and I guess they're losing money on used copies of the game.

1719
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:08,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're wrong though, because that's retarded.

1720
02:12:09,022 --> 02:12:14,868
[SPEAKER_08]: If I buy something and I sell it to somebody else, why should you get a piece of that?

1721
02:12:29,980 --> 02:12:38,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like if I sell, you know, my refrigerator to someone else because I'm going to get a newer, fancier refrigerator, I don't have to send Maytag 20 bucks.

1722
02:12:38,644 --> 02:12:39,725
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1723
02:12:39,825 --> 02:12:45,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's basically like, you know, I saw like some comments or something, talkbacks about it.

1724
02:12:45,648 --> 02:12:52,191
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you own your money 100% and it's all bartering basically because you're trading your money.

1725
02:12:52,771 --> 02:12:55,253
[SPEAKER_08]: for 100% ownership of said game.

1726
02:12:55,833 --> 02:13:04,579
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they want a portion of when you sell that game, then you should get a portion of the money that they spend on, say, when they buy groceries.

1727
02:13:05,699 --> 02:13:07,440
[SPEAKER_09]: CD industry's had to deal with this for years.

1728
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:08,321
[SPEAKER_09]: It hasn't killed them.

1729
02:13:08,501 --> 02:13:10,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Piracy killed the CD industry.

1730
02:13:10,623 --> 02:13:11,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1731
02:13:11,803 --> 02:13:12,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, I mean...

1732
02:13:14,125 --> 02:13:25,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Use game sales can be good because you say a consumer doesn't really want to buy your game at full price and say they buy Halo 1 and then they like it and then they go out and buy Halo 2 when it comes out.

1733
02:13:25,789 --> 02:13:26,649
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's extra sales.

1734
02:13:26,789 --> 02:13:30,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see how this is a bad thing and besides, you already got paid.

1735
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:31,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

1736
02:13:32,491 --> 02:13:39,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, why are they even complaining about the fact that they don't sell as many units because they've already sold those units to retail stores.

1737
02:13:39,653 --> 02:13:42,194
[SPEAKER_08]: The retail stores now have to sell them

1738
02:13:44,007 --> 02:13:50,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they decide to sell used games over new games, like a lot of these game stores like GameStop, they push their used sales.

1739
02:13:50,991 --> 02:13:54,473
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, if they have a used copy, they'll be like, hey, do you want the used copy instead?

1740
02:13:56,134 --> 02:13:58,755
[SPEAKER_08]: They push those first because they're making more money off of them anyway.

1741
02:13:58,815 --> 02:13:59,476
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's it matter?

1742
02:13:59,516 --> 02:14:01,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they've already paid you for the product.

1743
02:14:02,594 --> 02:14:03,615
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not losing out on anything.

1744
02:14:03,915 --> 02:14:05,395
[SPEAKER_09]: TheRobD has an interesting comment in chat.

1745
02:14:05,455 --> 02:14:06,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess what, developers?

1746
02:14:06,776 --> 02:14:07,737
[SPEAKER_09]: DLC exists.

1747
02:14:08,037 --> 02:14:09,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us a reason to keep it.

1748
02:14:09,437 --> 02:14:11,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Even better, make additional content free.

1749
02:14:11,378 --> 02:14:11,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1750
02:14:11,819 --> 02:14:12,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us a reason to keep your game.

1751
02:14:13,079 --> 02:14:17,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Download content where it's at because that's a way you can make more money off of each game you sell.

1752
02:14:19,903 --> 02:14:20,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1753
02:14:21,183 --> 02:14:26,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I definitely don't think that they should ever get to the point where they have to get a portion of you to sell.

1754
02:14:26,946 --> 02:14:27,927
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just stupid.

1755
02:14:28,803 --> 02:14:32,526
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, moving on to other people that want a piece of the pie.

1756
02:14:33,507 --> 02:14:35,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Activision Blizzard has gone on the record.

1757
02:14:35,649 --> 02:14:47,400
[SPEAKER_09]: The CEO, Bobby Kotick, has said basically a response to what the Warner Music executive, Edgar Bronfman, said previously.

1758
02:14:47,881 --> 02:14:54,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And what he had said was that the royalty rates for songs that are used in Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and so on are paltry.

1759
02:14:54,807 --> 02:14:55,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1760
02:15:24,341 --> 02:15:27,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe people should be paying them to put their songs in the game.

1761
02:15:27,702 --> 02:15:28,883
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like free advertising.

1762
02:15:31,023 --> 02:15:32,644
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because the songs make the game.

1763
02:15:32,764 --> 02:15:37,666
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to take that route and like, well, we're not going to put any songs in our game unless you pay us to do it.

1764
02:15:38,346 --> 02:15:41,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go right ahead and see what your song list looks like then.

1765
02:15:42,107 --> 02:15:43,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, that's a very good point.

1766
02:15:43,208 --> 02:15:45,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Without these songs, then the game is going to be nothing.

1767
02:15:45,428 --> 02:15:52,391
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, there's kind of a fine line here because I think if these guys get too greedy, especially if it's one company over the others...

1768
02:15:53,011 --> 02:15:59,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Then they'll be able to still put out a perfectly solid game from music from other labels that are out there.

1769
02:15:59,474 --> 02:16:03,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just look at some other companies doing similar things.

1770
02:16:03,717 --> 02:16:10,180
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop, and I'm sure this is true for a lot of other retailers as well, they charge companies to put their games in the store.

1771
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:12,201
[SPEAKER_08]: They charge them for shelf space.

1772
02:16:12,941 --> 02:16:20,065
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually, when they have signage in their store for a certain game, they make those companies pay for that signage to be in their store.

1773
02:16:20,825 --> 02:16:21,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's just ridiculous.

1774
02:16:22,046 --> 02:16:23,387
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing with this.

1775
02:16:23,807 --> 02:16:28,631
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying, oh, well, our game is immensely popular, and because of it, your music is becoming more popular.

1776
02:16:28,711 --> 02:16:31,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the reason people buy that game in the first place is because of your song list.

1777
02:16:32,474 --> 02:16:35,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And if your song list sucks, then people won't buy your game.

1778
02:16:36,057 --> 02:16:37,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you won't have your popularity.

1779
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:44,604
[SPEAKER_09]: In my mind, both sides stand to lose something if they can't agree on it.

1780
02:16:45,224 --> 02:16:48,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would say then, I think it should stay the way it is.

1781
02:16:49,246 --> 02:16:49,947
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1782
02:17:16,027 --> 02:17:22,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Sonic M88 in chat says, over at chat.orange.com says, I discovered a lot of great songs in the Guitar Hero games.

1783
02:17:22,291 --> 02:17:25,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I love playing the game despite the fact that I didn't know most of the songs.

1784
02:17:26,313 --> 02:17:31,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, but there are music game fans that are going to play these games no matter what, even if they don't know a single song in them.

1785
02:17:31,777 --> 02:17:39,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think certainly part of the reason why Guitar Hero really kind of broke out in some sense is because it was a lot of those songs you've always wanted to play on the guitar.

1786
02:17:39,221 --> 02:17:39,662
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1787
02:17:40,182 --> 02:17:42,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, they did a really good job marketing their game.

1788
02:17:43,544 --> 02:17:44,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I think as well.

1789
02:17:44,265 --> 02:17:45,907
[SPEAKER_09]: They got it out there in the press.

1790
02:17:46,307 --> 02:17:50,912
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember when that guy went over to Jamie's house and you guys got interviewed for the news?

1791
02:17:51,452 --> 02:17:56,738
[SPEAKER_09]: That was probably because Red Octane put out a press release about the game and was able to call attention to it.

1792
02:17:57,018 --> 02:17:59,681
[SPEAKER_09]: They were very good at getting themselves in the papers and everything.

1793
02:18:01,257 --> 02:18:01,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of a thought.

1794
02:18:02,098 --> 02:18:03,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also pretty fun.

1795
02:18:04,259 --> 02:18:14,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, on top of that, it just seemed to me like there was a much better appreciation to the gamers themselves that actually wanted to work with the community.

1796
02:18:15,145 --> 02:18:15,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1797
02:18:15,325 --> 02:18:17,747
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, let's move on with some more news.

1798
02:18:21,112 --> 02:18:22,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghostbusters Game

1799
02:18:41,599 --> 02:18:48,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, for all those rumors been floating around about another Ghostbusters movie, that might actually be a little bit more likely.

1800
02:18:48,607 --> 02:18:49,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1801
02:18:50,909 --> 02:18:51,349
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope.

1802
02:18:54,453 --> 02:18:55,594
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as he's not too old for it.

1803
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:57,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll see.

1804
02:18:57,441 --> 02:19:05,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe he's realizing that some of these other movies he's making aren't exactly as good as, you know, he hasn't exactly been on a big movie streak lately.

1805
02:19:06,068 --> 02:19:06,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1806
02:19:06,389 --> 02:19:10,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I just couldn't see that Ghostbusters 3 would actually be that big of a movie if they did one.

1807
02:19:10,292 --> 02:19:10,832
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1808
02:19:11,012 --> 02:19:13,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe a lot of it depends on star power and who they get in the movie.

1809
02:19:14,055 --> 02:19:19,079
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they don't have the right people in the movie, I don't know if there'd really be that much interest in a Ghostbusters 3.

1810
02:19:19,119 --> 02:19:19,840
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1811
02:19:21,092 --> 02:19:23,655
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw says there is a third Ghostbusters movie in the works.

1812
02:19:23,715 --> 02:19:25,276
[SPEAKER_09]: It's being written by the writers of The Office.

1813
02:19:25,557 --> 02:19:26,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that only a rumor?

1814
02:19:27,018 --> 02:19:27,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a rumor.

1815
02:19:27,839 --> 02:19:28,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1816
02:19:30,682 --> 02:19:33,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, there's one of the games that they were talking about at E3.

1817
02:19:34,045 --> 02:19:38,910
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Mag the Massive Action Game, I guess.

1818
02:19:39,871 --> 02:19:44,974
[SPEAKER_08]: It will apparently be not free to play.

1819
02:19:45,014 --> 02:19:50,257
[SPEAKER_08]: They are going to plan on charging either a yearly or monthly fee.

1820
02:19:50,957 --> 02:19:56,220
[SPEAKER_08]: They will also have one-time fees for content downloads as well.

1821
02:19:57,320 --> 02:20:04,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I guess it mentions that they may have hosting partners like EA and Activision.

1822
02:20:06,155 --> 02:20:30,444
[SPEAKER_08]: hmm but uh I don't know I guess this is sort of it didn't really seem like an MMO to me but it is kind of surprising though that an online game like this won't be free to play but I guess when you have like 256 players you probably need some serious network hardware for that hmm I don't know we'll just hopefully make the game cheap the buy then if that's the case you know like Warhawk or something where it's 40 bucks instead of 60 yeah

1823
02:20:32,827 --> 02:20:33,027
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1824
02:20:33,207 --> 02:20:35,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, remember when we used to learn a lot of things from our games?

1825
02:20:36,230 --> 02:20:40,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was a little piece that's been circulating around different gaming blogs this week.

1826
02:20:40,273 --> 02:20:47,038
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from the Educational Games Research blog, which kind of puts out information regularly about educational games.

1827
02:20:47,338 --> 02:20:52,262
[SPEAKER_09]: They compiled a list this week, the top 10 most influential educational video games from the 1980s.

1828
02:20:52,642 --> 02:20:54,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, keep in mind, it's just one guy's opinion.

1829
02:20:54,644 --> 02:20:55,284
[SPEAKER_09]: It's someone who...

1830
02:20:56,725 --> 02:20:57,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Number 3, SimCity

1831
02:21:18,328 --> 02:21:19,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Number four, Reader Rabbit.

1832
02:21:20,369 --> 02:21:21,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Reader Rabbit?

1833
02:21:21,729 --> 02:21:25,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Number five, Math Blaster, which was very similar to Reader Rabbit.

1834
02:21:25,771 --> 02:21:29,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Or no, no, it weren't that they were similar, but it seems like both those games were kind of like hand-in-hand games.

1835
02:21:29,852 --> 02:21:33,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about you guys, but it seemed like when I was younger, those games kind of were hand-in-hand.

1836
02:21:33,634 --> 02:21:35,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Number six, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.

1837
02:21:36,775 --> 02:21:38,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Number seven, Lemonade Stand.

1838
02:21:40,362 --> 02:21:41,364
[SPEAKER_09]: 8.

1839
02:21:40,602 --> 02:21:41,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Number Munchers 9.

1840
02:21:43,066 --> 02:21:43,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Zork 10.

1841
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:44,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Windows Solitaire

1842
02:21:55,334 --> 02:22:23,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's something that you're supposed to you learn how to use the mouse with it so it's an educational game which I can see that but it's just very odd to see that on this list and number 11 M U L E which is strange because it's a top 10 list but they put Mule on this list as well which is a great game that I guess you know you kind of learn about barter and exchange in that game but I don't know if I'd call that an educational game either of particular interest why this story kind of piqued my interest because I've seen this around on different gaming blog sites this week um

1843
02:22:24,324 --> 02:22:33,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I tackled this same topic a year ago on my personal blog that I was running for a while back when the All Games Radio Ning site was a little more popular.

1844
02:22:33,430 --> 02:22:34,872
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I'll link it here in chat.

1845
02:22:35,112 --> 02:22:36,533
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually read my list here.

1846
02:22:37,934 --> 02:22:40,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for those guys that are listening on the podcast.

1847
02:22:40,335 --> 02:22:45,199
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't see this, but just go to allgamesradio.ning.com and look for my profile and you'll find this.

1848
02:22:46,139 --> 02:22:51,363
[SPEAKER_09]: This was my list of the top 10 edutainment games of all time because I used to play a lot of them growing up.

1849
02:22:51,803 --> 02:22:53,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Number 10, The Incredible Machine.

1850
02:22:54,025 --> 02:22:55,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Rocky's Boots is a hell of a lot of fun.

1851
02:22:55,166 --> 02:22:55,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Number eight, I just...

1852
02:23:18,266 --> 02:23:21,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Apple Logo, because it was kind of like your first programming language that you would learn in school.

1853
02:23:22,389 --> 02:23:24,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Number seven, I also put Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.

1854
02:23:25,332 --> 02:23:27,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Number six, I also put Math Blasters.

1855
02:23:27,974 --> 02:23:30,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Number five, I put a game called Cave of the Word Wizard.

1856
02:23:31,216 --> 02:23:47,729
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a game that you had on the Commodore 64, and what made this game notable is that it actually used the Commodore 64's speech chip to actually say the names of words that you would have to spell out to the Word Wizard, where he'd take away your health, or your flashlight battery, and then if your battery goes out, you basically die of death.

1857
02:23:48,919 --> 02:23:50,200
[SPEAKER_09]: You get eaten alive by bats.

1858
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:52,982
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't know, but you don't want your flashlight battery to run out.

1859
02:23:53,423 --> 02:23:56,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And I put number four, where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego.

1860
02:23:56,806 --> 02:23:59,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Number three, The Island of Dr. Brain.

1861
02:23:59,508 --> 02:24:01,390
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a great educational title.

1862
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:03,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it wasn't the 80s, so that's probably why it wasn't on the other guy's list.

1863
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:07,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I put number two, Number Munchers, and number one, The Oregon Trail.

1864
02:24:08,035 --> 02:24:16,602
[SPEAKER_09]: So kind of funny that I don't know, you know, I don't profess to be an educational games expert, yet my list was pretty similar, except for the fact I had a couple games from the 90s in there.

1865
02:24:16,983 --> 02:24:17,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1866
02:24:18,137 --> 02:24:19,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I just thought I'd share that.

1867
02:24:20,879 --> 02:24:23,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody read the article when I posted it the first time.

1868
02:24:23,321 --> 02:24:24,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's Lee's Resuit, Larry?

1869
02:24:25,062 --> 02:24:27,965
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not an educational game, Loki.

1870
02:24:29,045 --> 02:24:31,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care what you think you learned from it.

1871
02:24:31,327 --> 02:24:33,389
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not technically an educational game.

1872
02:24:35,632 --> 02:24:39,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Amaze Satsuma is looking at my blog saying, man, did number munchers really look that bad?

1873
02:24:39,435 --> 02:24:39,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it did.

1874
02:24:39,896 --> 02:24:40,856
[SPEAKER_09]: The first version did.

1875
02:24:41,157 --> 02:24:45,120
[SPEAKER_09]: They made prettier versions of it as time went on, but the very first version was very plain looking.

1876
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:47,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Atari 2600 style graphics.

1877
02:24:48,022 --> 02:24:49,964
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, enough about educational games.

1878
02:24:50,004 --> 02:24:51,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get back to brain rotting games.

1879
02:24:52,506 --> 02:24:56,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's not brain rotting, it's just, um, well, violent.

1880
02:24:56,428 --> 02:24:57,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And violence is always good.

1881
02:24:58,549 --> 02:25:00,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps release tension or something.

1882
02:25:01,651 --> 02:25:15,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, basically, this is, uh, some very good news for all of those people who had always, you know, had the, uh, you must defeat Shenlong to stand a chance and thinking it was, uh, you know, this was a hidden character or something.

1883
02:25:16,438 --> 02:25:44,232
[SPEAKER_03]: um actually uh Goken who was supposed to be uh Ryu and Ken's uh teacher uh is going to be a uh a hidden character in the game but he's not playable he's just going to show up every so often beat the crap out of you toasty um but it is uh there is an unlock procedure for it but um he's gonna be hardcore tough sweet

1884
02:25:44,798 --> 02:25:46,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's pretty happy.

1885
02:25:46,619 --> 02:25:51,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, I have a feeling that someone's going to find some way to control him.

1886
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:52,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah.

1887
02:25:52,281 --> 02:25:53,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Or he'll be a download character.

1888
02:25:54,261 --> 02:25:54,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1889
02:25:54,841 --> 02:25:55,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something.

1890
02:25:55,542 --> 02:25:56,262
[SPEAKER_03]: A pay to unlock.

1891
02:25:56,522 --> 02:25:56,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1892
02:25:57,702 --> 02:26:05,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if there's going to be another Grand Theft Auto game coming out, then there's got to be another controversy coming with it.

1893
02:26:06,105 --> 02:26:11,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, with the announcement of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, and now that more details are leaking out about it,

1894
02:26:12,062 --> 02:26:13,803
[SPEAKER_08]: People are throwing a fit.

1895
02:26:13,883 --> 02:26:26,129
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, the British tabloid The Sun, which for some reason is now covering video game stuff every now and then, has a headline called Fury Over Drug Deal Vid Game.

1896
02:26:27,009 --> 02:26:35,974
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, includes comments from a guy named Darren Gold of a support group called Drugs Line.

1897
02:26:36,654 --> 02:26:40,376
[SPEAKER_08]: And anything using drug dealing as entertainment is sending out the wrong message.

1898
02:26:41,196 --> 02:26:48,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Glamourism doesn't help our work in trying to educate kids of the dangers of substance misuse.

1899
02:26:50,079 --> 02:26:50,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome!

1900
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:51,360
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

1901
02:26:51,620 --> 02:26:57,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with you in the fact that kids should be taught about drugs and how bad they are and stuff.

1902
02:26:57,742 --> 02:27:03,204
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing is kids shouldn't be playing this game because it's rated M. So, my god, people, please.

1903
02:27:03,524 --> 02:27:07,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And in case, if you didn't notice, you can sell drugs in this game.

1904
02:27:07,906 --> 02:27:08,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Because...

1905
02:27:09,892 --> 02:27:13,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto likes to piss people off and controversy sells.

1906
02:27:13,676 --> 02:27:14,877
[SPEAKER_08]: So, awesome.

1907
02:27:14,977 --> 02:27:18,761
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember, parents, the ratings are on the box for a reason.

1908
02:27:19,162 --> 02:27:22,806
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, if you don't really give a shit about the ratings, then do your kids a favor and buy them porn.

1909
02:27:25,339 --> 02:27:28,060
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Darkknight in chat says, Winners don't use drugs.

1910
02:27:28,821 --> 02:27:29,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the old FBI warning?

1911
02:27:30,202 --> 02:27:42,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, have you ever noticed that in, I don't think it's in Rock Band 1, but in Rock Band 2, there's an arcade level that you play in, and you can, if you actually look at the screens, one of them has that little FBI warning on it that says, Winners don't use drugs.

1912
02:27:43,068 --> 02:27:44,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was pretty awesome.

1913
02:27:44,089 --> 02:27:46,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Kudos to whoever at Harmonix snuck that in.

1914
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:47,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, you.

1915
02:27:49,140 --> 02:27:52,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claw posted a link in chat of some pictures of the drug dealing minigame.

1916
02:27:53,424 --> 02:27:57,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is strange because haven't no pictures of this game been released?

1917
02:27:57,408 --> 02:27:58,189
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they have been.

1918
02:27:58,229 --> 02:28:03,955
[SPEAKER_08]: They were in a game magazine called Game... Was it Nintendo Power?

1919
02:28:04,095 --> 02:28:05,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm sure no one's heard of it.

1920
02:28:06,057 --> 02:28:06,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1921
02:28:07,819 --> 02:28:09,100
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like saying, oh my god, fire's hot.

1922
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:09,240
[SPEAKER_08]: It is?! !

1923
02:28:36,483 --> 02:28:39,027
[SPEAKER_09]: One more piece of kind of late breaking news for you guys.

1924
02:28:39,087 --> 02:28:41,831
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very big rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor.

1925
02:28:42,324 --> 02:28:57,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, over at an Xbox India event that has happened over in Delhi, India, apparently it has been confirmed, I use that term loosely though, that there will be a slim Xbox 360 console that will be released in 2009.

1926
02:28:58,955 --> 02:29:01,137
[SPEAKER_09]: This is coming from some Indian gaming blogs.

1927
02:29:02,077 --> 02:29:11,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they are also saying that India is going to be getting some time with Fable 2, Gears of War 2, and Fallout 3 a week earlier than supposedly anyone else is supposed to be.

1928
02:29:12,504 --> 02:29:13,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, I'm quite skeptical.

1929
02:29:13,885 --> 02:29:17,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they may get to try it a week before it comes out, but big deal.

1930
02:29:17,287 --> 02:29:18,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

1931
02:29:19,488 --> 02:29:20,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, though.

1932
02:29:20,609 --> 02:29:25,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess a redesign of the console makes sense, although they never redesigned the original Xbox.

1933
02:29:25,912 --> 02:29:27,893
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't really let it live its full life, either.

1934
02:29:27,933 --> 02:29:29,915
[SPEAKER_09]: They kind of rushed the 360 out, you know?

1935
02:29:31,016 --> 02:29:33,298
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, Major Nelson has actually commented on it.

1936
02:29:33,378 --> 02:29:40,706
[SPEAKER_09]: He told popular blog Xbox360Fanboy that quote, I have no knowledge of an event in India and therefore anything related to one.

1937
02:29:41,066 --> 02:29:44,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all know that if we had something to say, we'd be saying it.

1938
02:29:45,290 --> 02:29:45,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1939
02:29:46,502 --> 02:29:47,083
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1940
02:30:08,786 --> 02:30:11,908
[SPEAKER_08]: A digital camera built in to a console.

1941
02:30:12,388 --> 02:30:14,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because a console really uses the camera.

1942
02:30:14,529 --> 02:30:16,870
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, that reminds me, I got a buy... It was a DS joke.

1943
02:30:17,110 --> 02:30:18,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know it was a DS joke.

1944
02:30:18,351 --> 02:30:19,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I caught that.

1945
02:30:19,232 --> 02:30:20,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, really?

1946
02:30:20,512 --> 02:30:21,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that something we talked about earlier?

1947
02:30:22,013 --> 02:30:22,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was.

1948
02:30:23,294 --> 02:30:24,855
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what we call like a loopback joke.

1949
02:30:25,175 --> 02:30:26,455
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, that's so crazy.

1950
02:30:26,515 --> 02:30:30,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like... Have you been paying attention for the past hour?

1951
02:30:30,457 --> 02:30:33,299
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like foreshadowing, but in reverse, backshadowing.

1952
02:30:36,058 --> 02:30:38,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other smart-ass comments before I open up the Skype line?

1953
02:30:38,219 --> 02:30:46,984
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was gonna say that more people will need to buy a camera for LittleBigPlanet, I guess, when it comes out, because it uses the PlayStation Eye heavily.

1954
02:30:47,124 --> 02:30:49,906
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you encouraging people to run out and buy Eye of Judgment so they can get the camera?

1955
02:30:49,946 --> 02:30:51,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck no, but it's a waste of money.

1956
02:30:51,106 --> 02:30:52,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy the camera, it's cheaper.

1957
02:30:52,927 --> 02:30:53,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1958
02:30:53,207 --> 02:30:56,389
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call.

1959
02:30:56,429 --> 02:30:58,010
[SPEAKER_09]: We have time for a couple of calls here tonight.

1960
02:30:58,350 --> 02:31:01,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1961
02:31:01,112 --> 02:31:01,912
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all one word.

1962
02:31:01,972 --> 02:31:03,033
[SPEAKER_09]: You can call us right now.

1963
02:31:03,073 --> 02:31:04,534
[SPEAKER_09]: The Skype line is open.

1964
02:31:05,711 --> 02:31:06,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1965
02:31:06,831 --> 02:31:07,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1966
02:31:08,071 --> 02:31:09,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

1967
02:31:09,172 --> 02:31:10,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Ranma, how you doing?

1968
02:31:10,972 --> 02:31:11,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty good.

1969
02:31:12,012 --> 02:31:14,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Tired from this weekend, but other than that, I'm doing all right.

1970
02:31:14,833 --> 02:31:19,514
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I got pictures on my cell phone from you this weekend, so I know what this means.

1971
02:31:19,974 --> 02:31:22,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma went to another con yet again.

1972
02:31:22,834 --> 02:31:24,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have a surprise.

1973
02:31:24,295 --> 02:31:26,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I want you to take a look at this picture I just posted in the chat room.

1974
02:31:26,995 --> 02:31:27,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1975
02:31:27,255 --> 02:31:28,855
[SPEAKER_07]: You might call him a con man.

1976
02:31:29,956 --> 02:31:31,156
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm a con whore.

1977
02:31:32,236 --> 02:31:35,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I was dressed up as Ranma and people were stopping for my picture half the time

1978
02:32:00,407 --> 02:32:02,407
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very nice, cool little outfit though.

1979
02:32:02,507 --> 02:32:04,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm looking at the gallery though at the bottom of this page.

1980
02:32:04,668 --> 02:32:05,868
[SPEAKER_09]: There's somebody dressed as Kirby.

1981
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:06,588
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks cute.

1982
02:32:07,989 --> 02:32:13,870
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually somebody tall, but the costume is designed where they can just sit down inside it and roll around, kind of, sort of.

1983
02:32:14,750 --> 02:32:15,990
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a cute little Kirby.

1984
02:32:16,370 --> 02:32:19,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, now you've got me ogling these pictures of cosplay.

1985
02:32:19,211 --> 02:32:20,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how was the con?

1986
02:32:20,811 --> 02:32:23,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, you know, the gaming components of it.

1987
02:32:23,152 --> 02:32:25,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Were there lots of gaming cosplay at the con?

1988
02:32:26,698 --> 02:32:31,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, and when it comes to gaming, what is this gaming that you speak of?

1989
02:32:32,162 --> 02:32:32,683
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean?

1990
02:32:33,623 --> 02:32:36,545
[SPEAKER_07]: There was only one game at the convention.

1991
02:32:37,426 --> 02:32:38,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, what was that?

1992
02:32:39,848 --> 02:32:42,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Ubisoft's Naruto 2 for Xbox 360.

1993
02:32:42,830 --> 02:32:45,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, because that ties directly back into anime.

1994
02:32:46,260 --> 02:32:49,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they had like two big screens up for demo play.

1995
02:32:49,203 --> 02:32:50,424
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the only game that they had.

1996
02:32:50,825 --> 02:32:53,127
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a cool little Kingdom Hearts cosplay.

1997
02:32:53,187 --> 02:32:54,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the game room?

1998
02:32:55,049 --> 02:32:55,590
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the game room?

1999
02:32:55,630 --> 02:32:56,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh damn.

2000
02:32:56,611 --> 02:33:01,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I know this is horrible radio, but I'm looking at this Kingdom Hearts cosplay of somebody dressed up as a Heartless.

2001
02:33:01,176 --> 02:33:02,257
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty awesome, actually.

2002
02:33:03,686 --> 02:33:05,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen a few of those running around.

2003
02:33:05,426 --> 02:33:08,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So not a lot of gaming content at this convention.

2004
02:33:08,067 --> 02:33:12,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just because they just want to brandish themselves as strictly, you know, it is an anime festival after all.

2005
02:33:12,588 --> 02:33:14,829
[SPEAKER_09]: They just want to be strictly anime and nothing else?

2006
02:33:14,889 --> 02:33:16,729
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's no general rule.

2007
02:33:16,769 --> 02:33:18,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's just what people wanted.

2008
02:33:18,630 --> 02:33:23,071
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just mostly, I really didn't see a lot of cosplay myself.

2009
02:33:23,131 --> 02:33:25,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was in the dealer's room in the thicket of it all.

2010
02:33:26,352 --> 02:33:31,393
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of weird though because it looks like there was quite a bit of gaming cosplay for a con that didn't really have gaming.

2011
02:33:34,551 --> 02:33:35,371
[SPEAKER_07]: GoFig, you know?

2012
02:33:36,211 --> 02:33:36,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's cool.

2013
02:33:36,732 --> 02:33:39,772
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a whole little trio there dressed up like the Whirlwinds with you, those characters.

2014
02:33:40,652 --> 02:33:41,373
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of neat.

2015
02:33:42,333 --> 02:33:42,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

2016
02:33:43,953 --> 02:33:45,493
[SPEAKER_07]: So, good con?

2017
02:33:45,894 --> 02:33:46,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun time?

2018
02:33:47,554 --> 02:33:50,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an improvement over last year's, but it could have been better.

2019
02:33:50,415 --> 02:33:52,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I walked in, and I'm like, where's the con?

2020
02:33:53,015 --> 02:33:56,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, it's downstairs in the basement where it was last year.

2021
02:33:56,256 --> 02:34:01,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm thinking, since there was no digital life, it's going to be upstairs like Comic-Con was, but it wasn't.

2022
02:34:03,035 --> 02:34:05,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this was the convention that goes on the same time as Digital Life?

2023
02:34:06,558 --> 02:34:06,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2024
02:34:07,538 --> 02:34:10,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so Digital Life would have happened this past weekend.

2025
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:10,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2026
02:34:11,521 --> 02:34:12,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, interesting.

2027
02:34:14,283 --> 02:34:17,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, anything else you want to say about the convention before we get some more calls?

2028
02:34:17,905 --> 02:34:21,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Only thing that really annoyed me is that you have to pay extra for concerts and autographs.

2029
02:34:21,628 --> 02:34:24,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to get Almanos autographed was $60.

2030
02:34:25,111 --> 02:34:25,391
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2031
02:34:26,511 --> 02:34:27,312
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little weird.

2032
02:34:27,332 --> 02:34:28,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard of cons doing that before.

2033
02:34:29,033 --> 02:34:29,914
[SPEAKER_09]: They get away with it, though?

2034
02:34:30,663 --> 02:34:33,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, comic book conventions are known for doing it, but not anime conventions.

2035
02:34:34,085 --> 02:34:39,829
[SPEAKER_07]: But since I could not get Jamie her autograph, I got her a little gift to really cheer her up.

2036
02:34:40,029 --> 02:34:42,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm posting a picture of it in the chat room right now.

2037
02:34:42,110 --> 02:34:44,892
[SPEAKER_07]: It has something to do with one of her all-time favorite movies.

2038
02:34:47,233 --> 02:34:48,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to look right now, too.

2039
02:34:48,594 --> 02:34:49,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha!

2040
02:34:49,855 --> 02:34:50,695
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

2041
02:34:52,356 --> 02:34:53,097
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

2042
02:34:53,717 --> 02:34:54,238
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it?

2043
02:34:54,358 --> 02:34:56,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Winchester Tavern?

2044
02:34:56,719 --> 02:34:57,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see Shaun of the Dead?

2045
02:34:58,736 --> 02:35:00,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, okay.

2046
02:35:00,897 --> 02:35:01,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2047
02:35:02,338 --> 02:35:03,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought three of those.

2048
02:35:03,999 --> 02:35:05,900
[SPEAKER_09]: That is kind of randomly awesome.

2049
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:06,500
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so sweet.

2050
02:35:07,880 --> 02:35:10,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Where the hell did you find that at an anime con?

2051
02:35:11,462 --> 02:35:13,603
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on a dealer's table with shirts.

2052
02:35:13,703 --> 02:35:17,005
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're actually showing it today at cosplay now, so why not?

2053
02:35:17,865 --> 02:35:20,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw that at a couple other cons I've been to.

2054
02:35:21,147 --> 02:35:25,929
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they had Shaun of the Dead on the big screen in San Francisco not that long ago.

2055
02:35:26,317 --> 02:35:27,138
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2056
02:35:56,718 --> 02:35:58,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

2057
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:04,484
[SPEAKER_06]: It is he who likes to whore a bunch of time in live shows and podcasts.

2058
02:36:04,504 --> 02:36:07,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was going to say, you were just on Bobby's show like three hours ago.

2059
02:36:07,866 --> 02:36:08,587
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's all right.

2060
02:36:08,667 --> 02:36:12,049
[SPEAKER_09]: We welcome you to our program, especially with all the work you've done for our show.

2061
02:36:12,830 --> 02:36:14,251
[SPEAKER_09]: How can we not have you on the program?

2062
02:36:14,271 --> 02:36:16,592
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have a good radio voice, so I have something good to say.

2063
02:36:16,672 --> 02:36:18,314
[SPEAKER_09]: So what does he want to say tonight, Jason?

2064
02:36:19,595 --> 02:36:28,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of offended by Loki's remarks going, I'm not just whoring time, I'm whoring time about the exact same thing all over again.

2065
02:36:28,599 --> 02:36:34,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to take some offense to what Loki was saying about Fable 2 and all that nonsense.

2066
02:36:35,321 --> 02:36:36,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, say that again?

2067
02:36:37,022 --> 02:36:42,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's developers are lazy, Fable 2, no online co-op immediately, this, that, and the other.

2068
02:36:43,925 --> 02:36:46,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to take a little bit of offense to that.

2069
02:36:46,366 --> 02:36:46,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that?

2070
02:36:47,850 --> 02:37:12,883
[SPEAKER_06]: developers are not lazy and maybe it's a bit of respect that I'm getting out of the fact that I work at a job that has a lot of developers and when things don't go right and you find out about them it becomes a losing situation no matter what you try to do you either cut the feature out you push the product back you release it in a hodgepodge and everybody complains and you fix it again

2071
02:37:15,891 --> 02:37:18,676
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no simple matter, and developers typically aren't lazy.

2072
02:37:18,816 --> 02:37:20,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Lazy developers are the people who make big rigs.

2073
02:37:21,440 --> 02:37:26,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides that and New World Order, those people don't really exist in the software industry that means anything.

2074
02:37:28,571 --> 02:37:37,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, what about the fact that this was one of the biggest things that they were pushing in this game and now it's not there anymore?

2075
02:37:37,995 --> 02:37:42,238
[SPEAKER_09]: That to me is kind of what makes it what they're doing here newsworthy.

2076
02:37:42,538 --> 02:37:45,959
[SPEAKER_09]: If it had been just a little feature, I bet most of us wouldn't have blinked an eye at it.

2077
02:37:46,259 --> 02:37:52,462
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is a pretty big thing that they were selling in the game and now they've just basically said, well, it's not really going to be there the first day.

2078
02:37:52,602 --> 02:37:52,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

2079
02:37:53,003 --> 02:37:53,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2080
02:37:53,743 --> 02:37:56,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and the game was really big and the engine to power it too.

2081
02:37:57,645 --> 02:38:00,047
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have the game before you have the online component.

2082
02:38:00,967 --> 02:38:06,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they had detrimental lag, rendering issues, or anything.

2083
02:38:06,791 --> 02:38:11,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't even read into the details, but just on a purely... I don't even know what the word is.

2084
02:38:11,594 --> 02:38:16,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Just on a purely basic level, things don't go perfectly as planned.

2085
02:38:17,217 --> 02:38:18,998
[SPEAKER_06]: How long have they had this release date?

2086
02:38:19,943 --> 02:38:24,689
[SPEAKER_06]: that they're going to make because they're going to finish without this feature.

2087
02:38:24,869 --> 02:38:28,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not push the release date two weeks back to give us all the features?

2088
02:38:29,568 --> 02:38:56,697
[SPEAKER_06]: basically what it boils down to is there's no right or wrong way to do it but no matter what you do if you don't have a perfect product and nobody does if you don't have a perfect product it's a no-win situation something as big as this is definitely worse but it's a no-win situation to the developers who try and try and try and make one of these decisions because they're trying to make things better for their consumers

2089
02:38:57,265 --> 02:38:58,425
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2090
02:39:25,302 --> 02:39:41,771
[SPEAKER_06]: BigRig's New World Order like I said there are definitely the examples but those people who are that blatant go away never to be heard from again and we laugh them on the way out well not really because I mean look at like EA a lot of their recent sports games have had pretty bad problems in them

2091
02:39:42,411 --> 02:39:43,212
[SPEAKER_08]: and Mercenaries 2.

2092
02:39:43,472 --> 02:39:47,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to keep going back to this but seriously, oh my god.

2093
02:39:48,455 --> 02:39:53,919
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no way that these glitches, they couldn't have caught this stuff because I run into them so often in this game.

2094
02:39:54,359 --> 02:39:59,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody playtesting this stuff through would have run into at least a dozen of these each time.

2095
02:39:59,963 --> 02:40:05,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to say though, sometimes I gotta, just in defense of people who QA games because I know we have a lot of them that actually listen to this show.

2096
02:40:05,807 --> 02:40:09,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes they find these bugs and they report back and their superiors just don't care.

2097
02:40:09,770 --> 02:40:11,751
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of one of those things where it's like we don't have the time to fix it.

2098
02:40:12,932 --> 02:40:17,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well then, either way, it looks bad on the publishing company then.

2099
02:40:21,477 --> 02:40:24,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, any other thoughts on this?

2100
02:40:26,721 --> 02:40:27,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I have spent my time.

2101
02:40:28,542 --> 02:40:31,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have to echo SSJ100 Matt, though.

2102
02:40:31,965 --> 02:40:36,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I did play NHL 08, the demo at least, but I'm sure that was indicative enough of the actual game.

2103
02:40:37,677 --> 02:40:43,141
[SPEAKER_06]: and I had pucks going through the ice and I had a lot of funny things happening.

2104
02:40:43,641 --> 02:40:45,883
[SPEAKER_06]: NHL 09 has been pretty solid so far.

2105
02:40:47,084 --> 02:40:48,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely enjoying that.

2106
02:40:48,145 --> 02:40:49,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the first sports game.

2107
02:40:49,446 --> 02:40:50,947
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a simulation that I like.

2108
02:40:53,448 --> 02:40:54,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Even better than Blades of Steel?

2109
02:40:56,311 --> 02:40:57,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, simulation.

2110
02:40:57,892 --> 02:41:01,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else of that age was arcade style.

2111
02:41:01,234 --> 02:41:03,576
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually a sim that I'm thoroughly enjoying.

2112
02:41:04,127 --> 02:41:04,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough, fair enough.

2113
02:41:05,128 --> 02:41:07,530
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, Jason, we're going to let you go so we can try and get one more call.

2114
02:41:07,570 --> 02:41:09,491
[SPEAKER_09]: But thanks, of course, for the call and the insight.

2115
02:41:09,732 --> 02:41:10,252
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate it.

2116
02:41:10,272 --> 02:41:10,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

2117
02:41:10,893 --> 02:41:11,473
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, have a good one.

2118
02:41:11,493 --> 02:41:12,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2119
02:41:12,234 --> 02:41:17,658
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2120
02:41:17,698 --> 02:41:24,244
[SPEAKER_09]: If you'd like to give us a call, we'll probably take like one more call and then call it a night here at Orange Lounge Radio and get to wrapping up the show.

2121
02:41:25,424 --> 02:41:28,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick, though, while we wait for the call, do we have any last-minute stories?

2122
02:41:29,071 --> 02:41:31,293
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop store their consoles in their bathroom

2123
02:41:42,788 --> 02:41:42,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Ew.

2124
02:41:43,429 --> 02:41:48,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I heard this also from that, was it that Zero... I don't remember.

2125
02:41:48,836 --> 02:41:52,802
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy that was mimicking Zero Punctuation, but bashing GameStop.

2126
02:41:52,822 --> 02:41:55,966
[SPEAKER_08]: He said the same thing about consoles in the bathroom, and now they had video of it.

2127
02:41:56,106 --> 02:41:58,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And it got taken down off of YouTube, apparently.

2128
02:41:58,589 --> 02:41:58,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

2129
02:41:59,698 --> 02:42:11,661
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, and I can say this from my experience with being in a number of game stops in the area, sometimes they're given such little storage space they actually have no choice but to put things in the bathroom.

2130
02:42:12,381 --> 02:42:23,483
[SPEAKER_03]: But if anyone is urinating or defecating on the console, I would definitely think there'd be a way to tell by the box it's contained in.

2131
02:42:25,644 --> 02:42:25,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

2132
02:42:27,952 --> 02:42:29,093
[SPEAKER_09]: What smells in here?

2133
02:42:30,334 --> 02:42:32,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Must be something the Sony's putting in the PlayStation.

2134
02:42:32,815 --> 02:42:36,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's absolutely no problem with them keeping a console in the bathroom.

2135
02:42:36,898 --> 02:42:41,541
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as, you know, it's kept away from the toilet and sink, it's fine.

2136
02:42:42,041 --> 02:42:44,242
[SPEAKER_03]: If they need the storage space, they need the storage space.

2137
02:42:44,262 --> 02:42:53,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't understand why a GameStop as a company, though, can't just, I don't know, spend some of that $7.5 billion that you're making or whatever and maybe... Two words.

2138
02:42:54,329 --> 02:42:54,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Bottom line.

2139
02:42:55,623 --> 02:43:04,392
[SPEAKER_09]: as long as no one's dipping their balls on them that's the most important thing next time I go buy a console it's a feature, what?

2140
02:43:04,773 --> 02:43:09,197
[SPEAKER_09]: alright Luke, we've got somebody on hold on the line, I want to get to him hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2141
02:43:10,078 --> 02:43:13,562
[SPEAKER_04]: hey there Orange Lounge Radio, this is Deekman hey Deekman, what's on your mind buddy?

2142
02:43:14,278 --> 02:43:14,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not a lot.

2143
02:43:14,738 --> 02:43:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to pimp a game that I don't think I've really heard anybody talking about the last couple of weeks.

2144
02:43:18,819 --> 02:43:19,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, please, by all means.

2145
02:43:20,460 --> 02:43:22,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Da Blob for Wii.

2146
02:43:22,561 --> 02:43:25,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys have seen this game, but it's awesome.

2147
02:43:25,441 --> 02:43:28,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing it pretty much all day, and it's freaking fantastic.

2148
02:43:28,462 --> 02:43:29,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I saw it at PAX.

2149
02:43:29,883 --> 02:43:31,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched Loki play it at PAX, actually.

2150
02:43:31,903 --> 02:43:34,524
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember the Blob game where you were painting the walls different colors?

2151
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:36,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was alright.

2152
02:43:36,705 --> 02:43:37,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just been loving it.

2153
02:43:37,505 --> 02:43:39,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like playing Katamari Damacy.

2154
02:43:40,146 --> 02:43:42,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It just gives me that same feeling of just a fun time.

2155
02:43:44,622 --> 02:43:44,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2156
02:43:44,902 --> 02:43:46,643
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of what makes this game to you?

2157
02:43:46,663 --> 02:43:49,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Because keep in mind, we only saw a few minutes of it at an expo.

2158
02:43:49,564 --> 02:43:51,966
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't really form a full opinion on the game based on that.

2159
02:43:52,026 --> 02:43:54,507
[SPEAKER_09]: So is it just the fun factor?

2160
02:43:54,747 --> 02:43:56,168
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of stuff do you do in this game?

2161
02:43:56,188 --> 02:43:56,868
[SPEAKER_09]: What makes it so fun?

2162
02:43:57,428 --> 02:44:06,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, you just play as a gelatinous blob that can take on different colors, and then you roll around the city, and every time you touch a building or an object, it just explodes with color.

2163
02:44:07,373 --> 02:44:12,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And you start off in a completely black and white, desolate world, and then you start touching buildings, and the whole city just comes to life.

2164
02:44:13,496 --> 02:44:16,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really quite impressive, especially for a third-party Wii title.

2165
02:44:18,038 --> 02:44:20,419
[SPEAKER_03]: That was that one that we saw at PAX, right?

2166
02:44:20,899 --> 02:44:22,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't remember if you were there.

2167
02:44:22,779 --> 02:44:23,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you were elsewhere on the show.

2168
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:24,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there.

2169
02:44:25,320 --> 02:44:26,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I grabbed the little comic book that came out with it.

2170
02:44:27,841 --> 02:44:29,602
[SPEAKER_03]: That was lots of fun.

2171
02:44:30,082 --> 02:44:32,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I really am interested in that one.

2172
02:44:33,743 --> 02:44:36,464
[SPEAKER_09]: So you literally get to paint the town red, as Frisbee says in chat.

2173
02:44:37,025 --> 02:44:37,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

2174
02:44:39,165 --> 02:44:39,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

2175
02:44:39,605 --> 02:44:40,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, check it out if you get the chance.

2176
02:44:41,736 --> 02:44:42,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2177
02:44:42,117 --> 02:44:43,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, we might have to check that out.

2178
02:44:43,579 --> 02:44:45,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it only on Wii, or did they put it on other systems?

2179
02:44:45,942 --> 02:44:49,907
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's only on Wii, but like I said, it is easily the best third-party Wii title I've ever seen.

2180
02:44:50,287 --> 02:44:50,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

2181
02:44:50,968 --> 02:44:51,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

2182
02:44:52,190 --> 02:44:53,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anything else you've been playing you want to share with us?

2183
02:44:55,114 --> 02:44:56,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody Amigo for the Wii.

2184
02:44:57,417 --> 02:44:58,378
[SPEAKER_09]: How'd that turn out?

2185
02:45:00,307 --> 02:45:00,607
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

2186
02:45:00,787 --> 02:45:01,768
[SPEAKER_09]: How did that game turn out?

2187
02:45:01,788 --> 02:45:04,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've been curious to pick it up, but there's just so much other stuff I'm playing right now.

2188
02:45:04,789 --> 02:45:06,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't had a chance.

2189
02:45:06,350 --> 02:45:07,890
[SPEAKER_04]: The controls are kind of here and there.

2190
02:45:07,930 --> 02:45:13,513
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really touchy, but I think that once you play with it for a couple of hours, you really get the idea of how to control the game.

2191
02:45:13,953 --> 02:45:15,394
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's really the only problem I've had with it.

2192
02:45:15,434 --> 02:45:16,714
[SPEAKER_04]: The track list is fantastic.

2193
02:45:16,774 --> 02:45:18,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm enjoying it.

2194
02:45:20,216 --> 02:45:20,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

2195
02:45:21,256 --> 02:45:21,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

2196
02:45:22,257 --> 02:45:22,597
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2197
02:45:27,904 --> 02:45:29,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you had fun posing in Samba de Amigo?

2198
02:45:29,726 --> 02:45:30,587
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the most important part.

2199
02:45:31,487 --> 02:45:33,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, and the hustle mode?

2200
02:45:33,349 --> 02:45:34,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.

2201
02:45:34,650 --> 02:45:35,591
[SPEAKER_04]: They really beefed it up.

2202
02:45:36,272 --> 02:45:37,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play that mode more than the regular mode.

2203
02:45:38,694 --> 02:45:39,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2204
02:45:39,454 --> 02:45:40,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well thanks so much for the call, Dekeman.

2205
02:45:40,836 --> 02:45:42,157
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta go and wrap up the show.

2206
02:45:42,757 --> 02:45:43,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, no worries.

2207
02:45:43,338 --> 02:45:43,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, guys.

2208
02:45:43,959 --> 02:45:44,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one.

2209
02:45:46,428 --> 02:45:46,768
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

2210
02:46:05,603 --> 02:46:08,705
[SPEAKER_03]: My last minute story is I like pie.

2211
02:46:09,426 --> 02:46:10,306
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a story.

2212
02:46:10,666 --> 02:46:11,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have one more.

2213
02:46:11,647 --> 02:46:18,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember I talked about last week the Wii ISO loader that got leaked out and then the guy making it when it...

2214
02:46:20,161 --> 02:46:22,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks like a Wenny Coco or something like that.

2215
02:46:22,342 --> 02:46:23,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Wen and Coco.

2216
02:46:24,363 --> 02:46:27,744
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, basically he was pissed off about the leak or something like that.

2217
02:46:27,864 --> 02:46:32,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he's like, well, you know, I'm not going to work on it anymore.

2218
02:46:32,806 --> 02:46:36,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And then later on the week, well, maybe I'll work on it some more.

2219
02:46:36,767 --> 02:46:39,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I missed the attention, so.

2220
02:46:39,408 --> 02:46:41,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, maybe I'll finish it now, so.

2221
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:45,522
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, ISO litter may be coming at some point.

2222
02:46:45,723 --> 02:46:46,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray!

2223
02:46:47,745 --> 02:46:54,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, if there's no other last minute stories, then we're going to go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thought and try to wrap up tonight's show.

2224
02:46:54,811 --> 02:46:55,772
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start off with Tiara.

2225
02:46:55,832 --> 02:46:57,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for joining us here tonight.

2226
02:46:57,634 --> 02:46:58,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you had fun.

2227
02:46:59,015 --> 02:47:01,198
[SPEAKER_09]: And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

2228
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:03,660
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

2229
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:03,720
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

2230
02:47:04,241 --> 02:47:04,441
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2231
02:47:04,901 --> 02:47:05,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a simple no.

2232
02:47:06,042 --> 02:47:08,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, have a safe flight back to Las Vegas and come see us again.

2233
02:47:08,803 --> 02:47:09,403
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely will.

2234
02:47:09,443 --> 02:47:09,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2235
02:47:09,983 --> 02:47:10,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2236
02:47:10,803 --> 02:47:12,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2237
02:47:12,264 --> 02:47:15,845
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I went this weekend and played Airsoft, and it was fun.

2238
02:47:15,965 --> 02:47:19,126
[SPEAKER_08]: So my gun, I have the P90 or whatever.

2239
02:47:19,166 --> 02:47:20,867
[SPEAKER_08]: I have these 300-round clips.

2240
02:47:21,367 --> 02:47:24,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hated having to run out of ammo and change clips and stuff.

2241
02:47:24,628 --> 02:47:25,788
[SPEAKER_08]: It just was inconvenient.

2242
02:47:25,828 --> 02:47:26,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So I bought a...

2243
02:47:28,649 --> 02:47:31,010
[SPEAKER_08]: 1500 round box magazine for it now.

2244
02:47:31,410 --> 02:47:32,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I will never run out of ammo.

2245
02:47:33,370 --> 02:47:33,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever.

2246
02:47:34,351 --> 02:47:34,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodie, goodie.

2247
02:47:35,631 --> 02:47:36,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Just don't bring that to the studio.

2248
02:47:37,591 --> 02:47:40,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I will bring it to the studio one of these days.

2249
02:47:40,352 --> 02:47:43,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Because somebody's going to get shot, especially if another Dance Hero argument breaks out.

2250
02:47:43,693 --> 02:47:46,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I'm surprised did not come up on Skype tonight.

2251
02:47:46,274 --> 02:47:47,154
[SPEAKER_09]: The Dance Hero thing.

2252
02:47:47,254 --> 02:47:47,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe next week.

2253
02:47:47,914 --> 02:47:48,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll get some emails.

2254
02:47:49,735 --> 02:47:54,596
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought would be I had a bite of John's Chinese food and it was really good.

2255
02:47:55,276 --> 02:47:58,658
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really good because I haven't had deep fried chicken in a long time.

2256
02:48:01,119 --> 02:48:04,620
[SPEAKER_09]: And a nice little humanized Mega Man picture there that DarkSakura is showing me.

2257
02:48:04,660 --> 02:48:06,121
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be my final thought.

2258
02:48:07,061 --> 02:48:08,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, then what is your final thought?

2259
02:48:08,672 --> 02:48:10,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone needs to go look at Masao's artwork.

2260
02:48:11,774 --> 02:48:25,721
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at www.5c.biglobe.ne.jp You are going to post that in chat, right?

2261
02:48:25,801 --> 02:48:26,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

2262
02:48:26,182 --> 02:48:27,182
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a long ass link.

2263
02:48:27,662 --> 02:48:35,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically this guy that does weird video game art and kind of scary Ronald McDonald art, but he does Mario and Luigi.

2264
02:48:35,807 --> 02:48:35,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2265
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:40,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm interested in the scary Ronald McDonald art.

2266
02:48:40,941 --> 02:48:43,242
[SPEAKER_03]: The artist is Masao, M-A-S-A-O.

2267
02:48:44,442 --> 02:48:45,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

2268
02:48:45,623 --> 02:48:51,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you didn't have a pen and paper to write down that link fast enough, and sadly you weren't in chat tonight, you should come join us for a live show sometime.

2269
02:48:51,605 --> 02:48:55,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, we always tape live Sunday nights on allgames.com about 6 o'clock.

02:48:55,826 --> 02:48:58,028

2271
02:48:58,349 --> 02:48:59,270

02:48:59,310 --> 02:49:00,431

2278
02:49:14,284 --> 02:49:17,766

2279
02:49:18,106 --> 02:49:22,588
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can't tell two friends about the show or even if you can, leave us a nice review on iTunes.

2280
02:49:22,628 --> 02:49:23,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to say another thank you.

2281
02:49:23,968 --> 02:49:34,073
[SPEAKER_09]: We got some more great reviews on iTunes this week and that's very nice and every little bit helps and makes us ranked that much better on iTunes and helps the visibility of the program.

2282
02:49:34,113 --> 02:49:35,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It really, really does help.
