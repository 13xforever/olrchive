1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,840
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,320
Tonight September 28, 2008, a Banjo-Kazooie remake gets dated, Dance Hero gets trademarked,

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,440
and an old friend of ours gets the boot.

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,840
Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,640
Hello everybody out there on the internet.

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,120
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,680
We are that podcast on the internet where every gamer has a voice, because every week

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,880
we talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and we invite

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,400
you to come be a part of our program.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,340
You can join us in chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, you can talk to us by phone later, send us

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,160
an email, however you want to do it.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000
You guys are going to help steer the show tonight, but we'll be here leading you through

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,800
the next few hours where we talk about the latest and greatest video gaming.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
My name is Rob Roberts.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,960
Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
Hi.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,160
How are you doing?

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
I'm okay.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,800
Your voice sounds a little better this week.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
It is.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Alright, good to hear.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,760
Also, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Hi.

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
How you doing?

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Good.

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
You have a stack of cheeseburgers.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,400
I don't know if the Justin.TV users can see us, or they can't, because it's hidden behind

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,720
your laptop here.

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,120
He has a stack of cheeseburgers.

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
It's only two.

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,080
Because, I mean, McDonald's cheeseburgers are like micro cheeseburgers.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,360
But I'm laughing because he literally has a stack of cheeseburgers.

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,240
As we'll get into it a little bit later in the program, I can't put them on the floor

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,880
because, oh yeah, there's acts of nature attack.

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,700
There's like, like here in the studio, which, you know, we have a real high tech studio.

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,580
It's basically a converted garage.

37
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,920
We have like ants or something that live under the floor.

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,280
So the funny thing is if you put food on the ground, the ants will rise up underneath and

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,360
like just storm the food is what Loki found out last week.

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Yes.

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,520
I should have learned the first time it happened weeks prior to that, but I thought it was

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
a fluke.

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,680
I was like ants in the garage?

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,400
There's no ants in the garage.

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,920
Ants in my garage?

46
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
All right.

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,600
Anyhow, let's also say hello to a special guest we have tonight.

48
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,440
And it's not very often that we have a fourth person joining us in studio anymore.

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,960
What happened to the locals?

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,040
Locals don't love us anymore.

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
They found women.

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
I guess.

53
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
I guess so.

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Well, so we had to bring a woman on our show and we had to bring a non-local woman on our

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400
show, but we love her.

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,860
Her name is Tiara all the way from Las Vegas.

57
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Say hello.

58
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
Hi.

59
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,860
How are you?

60
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Not too bad.

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,860
All right.

62
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,860
How was the flight?

63
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,860
Good.

64
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,860
The flight was really good.

65
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,560
They messed up my ticket or the terminals were down for the like automatic ticket printing

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,920
instead of having to go to the flight attendant type people.

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Right.

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,920
And so I got upgraded to first class for 20 bucks.

69
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Nice.

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Yeah.

71
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Did you see anyone famous in first class?

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,520
No, just a bunch of old people.

73
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Famous old people.

74
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Awesome.

75
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
All right.

76
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Well, welcome.

77
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Welcome to the show tonight.

78
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,960
And of course, the other reason why Tiara was here, she didn't come to join us just

79
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,840
for Orange Lounge Radio, although, you know, that would be nice, but I came for Journey.

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Yes.

81
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,440
Part of the way Tiara came so we could go see Journey and Heart and Cheap Trick.

82
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,360
And if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks, you know, we don't talk about

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
games.

84
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,540
We talk about our personal lives.

85
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,160
We love Journey.

86
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,760
And if you're Jamie, we love Heart.

87
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,360
And if you're me, you love both, honestly.

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
You really do.

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
And Cheap Trick.

90
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
But Heart is great.

91
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Cheap Trick.

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
They're okay.

93
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Although they're a bunch of divas because I met them years ago.

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
But anyway, Heart and Journey are great.

95
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,480
Now, here's the sad news is that we went to the concert, right?

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,560
As a lot of folks have been listening to us weeks and weeks, we talk about this.

97
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
We finally went to the concert.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,040
What should have been a 40 minute drive up to Marysville took us two and a half hours

99
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,920
to get up there because of traffic and everything.

100
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,520
So sadly, we had to listen to Ann Wilson belt out alone from the parking lot, which was

101
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,840
kind of sad.

102
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,100
But she still was really good.

103
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,840
That woman, her voice is amazing.

104
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Yes.

105
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,560
And we did get to, and for you Guitar Hero players, we did get to walk in there in time

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,980
to hear Barracuda, which was good.

107
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,560
So that was, I had a good time.

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,360
And then of course we got to see the whole Journey and, you know, I know we're not a

109
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,600
music program, but I will tell you Journey's new lead singer, I approve.

110
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,840
He's very, very good.

111
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,960
Yeah, I was really surprised because I didn't know what to expect, but he's very good.

112
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,600
And you know, apparently their latest CD is their biggest selling one in like 20 years.

113
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
That's what they said.

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,480
I think Neil Sean said that part of it.

115
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,920
So hey, all I'm saying is let's get some more Journey tracks and rock band, please.

116
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
That would be great.

117
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,100
Speaking of rock band, let's talk about your gaming week, Stark Sakura.

118
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,460
How was your gaming week?

119
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:44,440
We played some rock band over the weekend and Dan downloaded Mega Man 9, which was really,

120
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
really, really cool.

121
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:54,540
I mean, I was totally just in old school heaven watching, you know, a lot of the stuff.

122
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,760
And of course it played a little Ragnarok as usual.

123
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,320
And that's really, really about it for my gaming week.

124
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,800
Awesome.

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
You know, one thing I love about Mega Man 9.

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,400
I was busy dealing with other things.

127
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Oh, sure.

128
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,160
I wasn't able to get Mega Man 9 this week because I, you know, I have my little thing

129
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,400
going on with the Wii where I'm not downloading anything else on the Wii.

130
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,000
And I don't have a PlayStation 3 yet, although I'm thinking next week's the week.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,680
And then Xbox 360, I don't know, I just can't imagine playing a classic video game on that

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,400
Xbox 360 controller because that D-pad kind of sucks.

133
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,040
So I think I'm going to have to get it on PlayStation 3 if nothing else.

134
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,640
So hopefully soon.

135
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,600
But I love listening to the soundtrack.

136
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,800
They just, it's, it's perfect for an old school Mega Man game.

137
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,120
It's even, you can even use flicker to your advantage.

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,280
Nice.

139
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,000
Like if you get hit and you're going through a tough spot, you just like get hit once so

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,360
that you flicker enough to get through the hard stuff.

141
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Nice.

142
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
So maybe there's a reason not to turn it off.

143
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
It's it.

144
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,400
It's old school Mega Man.

145
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
That's all I can say.

146
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
All right.

147
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,220
Loki, how was your gaming week?

148
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,440
My gaming week was all right.

149
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,280
I played a bit of Mercenaries, Mercenaries 2, and actually this week I finally got to

150
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,200
try the co-op online and it's pretty fun actually.

151
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,280
I was playing with my friend Sean who just picked up the game and I swear to God this

152
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,360
game gets even more glitchier the longer I play it.

153
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,280
It's, it's awesome though.

154
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
I like that.

155
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,520
Did Loki just say more glitchier?

156
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,960
I think he did.

157
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,620
Yes, more glitchier, seriously.

158
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
More glitchier.

159
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,320
I could say it gets even glitchier, but no, it's more glitchier.

160
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
That's a technical term.

161
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,720
You're the most smartest host I've ever met.

162
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,960
I am the most smartest.

163
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Smarterist.

164
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,280
Can we get that in an iTunes review please?

165
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Smarterist.

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,080
The most, the more, this show is great, but it could be more glitchier.

167
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
More glitchier.

168
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,920
No, but the game is extremely glitchy.

169
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,480
There's absolutely no way that they tested this thing.

170
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,080
I think they just said, ah, fuck it, let's just release it.

171
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,160
And that's what they did.

172
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,160
So yeah, lots of things that are messed up.

173
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,600
I'm trying to think of some of the fun highlights of that.

174
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,400
There was a helicopter we couldn't get into because, or no, we got into the helicopter,

175
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
but it wouldn't fly.

176
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,640
It was a brand new helicopter too.

177
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,880
The guy had just dropped it off for me, got into the helicopter, propeller would not spin.

178
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
I was like, well this is useless.

179
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,320
Maybe you were just too fat for the copter.

180
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
No.

181
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,600
Hey, remember, this is my in-game persona.

182
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Not real life.

183
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Okay.

184
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,520
And then of course, you know, more Grand Theft Auto IV.

185
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
Did you just have maybe too much baggage in the back?

186
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,320
Because I think that's what happened to Aliyah.

187
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:47,000
Well I was carrying around this guy from United Petroleum, the fake oil company in the game.

188
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,720
But yeah, the game is just horribly glitched out, which is awesome.

189
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,500
Anyways, on to other things.

190
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,600
I played a game, a Flash game actually, called, I want to say it was Me and My Dad.

191
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,800
It's by the same people that do, you know, Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, and it's

192
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,320
basically you're this guy, I don't know, it's like some sort of demon kid who goes around

193
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,280
beating up other kids.

194
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,480
Just like most of the people in the game are completely harmless and just running around

195
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,800
and you just brutally beat them to death.

196
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
It's awesome.

197
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,700
This sounds like a Loki dream game.

198
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
It's awesome.

199
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:35,920
So I played that a little bit, and let's see, also tried a little bit of Disaster Day of

200
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,560
Crisis, and that game is so cheesy.

201
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,480
It's pretty fun though.

202
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,360
But kind of a really unique game.

203
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,160
It combines a little bit of like, platforming, with a little bit of like, some stuff that

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,920
reminds me of Time Crisis a bit, and just, I don't know, it has kind of the vibe of like

205
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,520
Ghost Squad or like a Time Crisis game.

206
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
Very over-the-top.

207
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,600
Okay, I gotta go back a little bit, rewind a little bit, because Chatroom brings up a

208
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
good point.

209
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,100
So, you know, first comment of the night from Shaoran in our chatroom, chat.ownershotshot.com.

210
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,040
Why is it called Me and My Dad then?

211
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,460
I don't know.

212
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,800
I never saw the guy's dad at any point in this, well, in the, actually the title screen

213
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,440
did have like a larger version of the main character, who I guess was his dad, but I

214
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,640
don't understand what Me and My Dad...

215
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,240
Maybe it's like a twist ending, and then...

216
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Maybe, I don't know, but maybe your dad joins you later and you can beat more people up,

217
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,620
I don't know, but it's, yeah, that's what it was called, at least.

218
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,760
They had a link on Destructoid for it, so if you want to check it out, just kind of

219
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,640
browse back a few pages.

220
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,140
But yeah, so that was fun, and of course I played more Castle Crashers, actually my headset

221
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:53,040
that I use on my PC, my headphones, they kind of died, so I went out and got some nice,

222
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:01,040
the Triton AX360s, so they're like 5.1 headsets now, and those are awesome, so I'm looking

223
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,560
forward to playing more with those, and yeah, that's pretty much it.

224
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Awesome.

225
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,640
Tiara, do you have anything you want to share with your gaming week, types of games you've

226
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
been playing?

227
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,440
Well, I haven't really had a chance to play a lot of games recently, since I just started

228
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,320
with school again, so, but I did play Ragnarok with Jamie, and we played Rock Band, and we

229
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,320
made Dan download Jimmy Buffett, so that I could sing Margaritaville.

230
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,680
Nice.

231
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
So you were the singer?

232
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Sometimes.

233
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,000
And let me guess, Jamie's bass player?

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,860
Actually, I did play a bit of bass, but I also made Dan get Skullcrusher Mountain.

235
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Very cool.

236
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,720
Alright, so that's pretty much it then, Rock Band, and learning.

237
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,600
That's pretty much it, and then Final Fantasy Tactics, and Joan of Arc on the PSP.

238
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,800
I don't know much about Joan of Arc, what's this game?

239
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,560
It's basically a tactics game, like Final Fantasy Tactics, except for it stars Joan

240
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,680
of Arc, and it takes the whole history of what happened during the time when she was

241
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,480
around, and turns it into this thing where magical demons are attacking, and you have

242
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,360
to defeat them to save France.

243
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Interesting.

244
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,600
Based on a true story.

245
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,120
They took some creative liberties, I think, but okay.

246
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,780
Yeah, just a few.

247
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,780
Very cool.

248
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
But is it fun?

249
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
That's the question.

250
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,400
Well, if you like tactics games, then yes, it's fun.

251
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,760
And I think, you know, it's kind of smart, even though they replaced all the people that

252
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,880
were invading France and everything with quote-unquote demons, it's still like if a kid played it,

253
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,220
they might learn some history out of it.

254
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,640
Because a lot of it is based on actual fact, but then, you know, you've got the weird stuff.

255
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,040
Except for the demons and the magic, yeah.

256
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Very nice.

257
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Alright, cool.

258
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,960
Sounds like a very interesting game.

259
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
My Gaming Week.

260
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Things I've been playing, pretty much, not a lot of new stuff, I have to say.

261
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,000
I've still been addicted to Rock Band 2.

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,840
Played a little bit more Warhammer, although I don't, sadly, know a lot of other people

263
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
on it.

264
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,860
I don't know how much longer I'm going to be playing Warhammer because of that fact.

265
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:15,080
I know there's some OLR listeners on it, and maybe I'll try to meet up with some of them.

266
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,400
Then World of Warcraft, of course.

267
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,920
And I guess the only new thing I really checked out this week was Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live

268
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Marketplace.

269
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,400
How could I forget playing that?

270
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Alright.

271
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Well, what did you think, Loki?

272
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
Oh, it's awesome.

273
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,120
It's exactly how I remembered it.

274
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,880
It is, except I was kind of surprised that, well, I'm not.

275
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,760
I mean, it's basically like the Doom port, where they didn't really redo anything, you

276
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,240
know what I mean?

277
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,000
But it does bring back a lot of great memories, because, man, I played a lot of Duke Nukem

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
3D when I was in college.

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,320
I kind of wish they had it, but I know, I understand why they didn't have it.

280
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,220
I wish they had the build editor in there to make their own levels, that'd be awesome.

281
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,360
It's too bad that you can't do some type of, like, yeah, as soon as you change levels.

282
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,720
I'm disappointed, there's no Atomic Edition in there as well, either.

283
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,120
All the added, they had a few added weapons, and, you know, the brand new levels, including

284
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,440
the one that, like, parodied Disneyland.

285
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm disappointed that wasn't in there.

286
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,960
Maybe it's a download pack later, who knows?

287
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
I hope.

288
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Download content, who knows?

289
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,400
But it's a very faithful port, and if you've never played Duke Nukem 3D, at least check

290
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
out the demo.

291
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,760
I see, I think you could do a multiplayer demo, if I'm not mistaken, so you can even

292
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,120
kind of taste a little bit of what that is all about.

293
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,600
And you can play the first two levels, at least, and it's fun.

294
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
Be sure to look around everywhere in that first level, because you can blow through

295
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,200
that first level in, like, a minute, but if you really stop to look around, there's tons

296
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,040
of secrets in the level.

297
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,400
Otherwise very similar to the Doom port we saw not that long ago.

298
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,240
That was pretty much it, though, for my gaming week.

299
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,040
Not a whole lot else to report, nothing really new, otherwise.

300
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,360
So let's talk about housekeeping real quick before we get into gaming news tonight.

301
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,520
I've had to pull out of E for All, which kind of stinks, but I am not going to be attending

302
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,720
E for All this weekend, after all, and I really apologize to those listeners that were planning

303
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,120
on going.

304
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,920
You know, please still continue to go to the All Games booth, which is being co-run by

305
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,000
the Championship Gaming series.

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,080
It's going to be pretty cool.

307
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,680
They're going to have some old school gaming celebrities there, and I think that's kind

308
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,160
of like one of the themes they're going with, is old school.

309
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,320
And I think it's going to be a lot of fun, and I'm really sad I can't go.

310
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,760
But do head out, especially if you're in the area.

311
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,200
If you're in the LA area, please head out to E for All this weekend.

312
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I think you'll have a lot of fun.

313
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,400
Sadly, I've had to pull out.

314
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,480
I'll just say it's kind of related to, you might remember, if you've been listening to

315
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,520
the show for a while, about six months ago, I had some medical issues.

316
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm okay, don't worry, but I'm probably going to have to have a surgery coming up, and I

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,200
have to get evaluated this weekend, and all that stuff.

318
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
So it has to do with all that.

319
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,720
So we'll let you know more details on that as it comes up.

320
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,840
Don't worry, it's gallbladder, it's very common, tons of people have had it.

321
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,360
I'll be fine.

322
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,000
So that's that.

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
All right, so let's get into some gaming news.

324
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,840
I don't really have a lot else to plug in housekeeping.

325
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,960
I can't think of anything else going on, except for the fact that episode 300, provided everything

326
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,240
stays on schedule, will be in like four weeks, which is crazy if you think of that.

327
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,680
300 shows, and at about, most of them have been three hours a piece.

328
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,280
I mean, some were two, some were three.

329
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,800
So let's say you said like two and a half hours for each one.

330
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,880
That's still like, what, 750 hours at least of content we've done over the years.

331
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,680
It's like a million bajillion hours of content.

332
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
Tons.

333
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
All right.

334
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,600
All right, anyway, let's move on.

335
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Gaming news.

336
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

337
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,400
Well, there's a Nintendo 64 game that's quite a classic that I never played, but looks interesting

338
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
nonetheless.

339
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Banjo-Kazooie.

340
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:46,160
We knew this was coming, the sort of remake or update to it, and it is coming now exclusively

341
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:55,760
to the Xbox Live Arcade on November 26, and it will be running you 1,200 Microsoft Points,

342
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:03,440
or free if you happen to pre-order at specific locations like GameStop, GameCrazy, Amazon,

343
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,680
whatnot.

344
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,920
And I believe you do get it a few weeks early that way, too.

345
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:16,640
Also announced in the same press release is Banjo-Tooie will be coming as well early 2009.

346
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
So that's pretty cool.

347
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,880
One other unique thing about this as well, there will be a stop and swap mode, and what

348
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,640
that's exactly going to do is progress that's made in the Xbox Live Arcade game will unlock

349
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,400
things in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.

350
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,560
So that's kind of cool.

351
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,840
That's an interesting little crossover, but just kind of a ploy to get people to spend

352
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
their money twice, right?

353
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Yeah.

354
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,820
But, I mean, it's not like they're the first people to ever do that, so...

355
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
By commando.

356
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,000
Except they didn't really have it locked, you know, it was more of a code, though, that

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
they gave out in that game.

358
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,840
Well, plus, you know, sometimes there's like DS and Wii things that kind of do that, like

359
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm thinking Geometry Wars had, I think, a certain mode that you could only get if you

360
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
had both or something.

361
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Yeah.

362
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
I think.

363
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Don't quote me on that.

364
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,520
But sometimes, you know, you have those, you know, you gotta own both to get a special

365
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,040
something or an unlock, so not too incredibly uncommon.

366
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,640
Plus Alien Hominin and Castle Crashers, right?

367
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Yes.

368
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Get a new character if you have them both?

369
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
Yeah.

370
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
So.

371
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Are you looking forward to Banjo-Kazooie?

372
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
You know, this is one of those games I never...

373
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
I gotta be...

374
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
I'm gonna be perfectly honest.

375
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
I never really played Banjo-Kazooie.

376
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,200
It was kind of during that period of my life where I wasn't playing video games a whole

377
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,320
lot because I was in college.

378
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,560
This is the one, one of those big series.

379
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,200
I never owned a Nintendo 64 until years and years later.

380
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,060
I never really played this series.

381
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,140
But I'll check it out, especially when it's on the Live Arcade, the re-release.

382
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,840
I'm not interested in the least.

383
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Why is that?

384
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Just never liked the first one?

385
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
It's too childish for me now.

386
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Ooh.

387
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Well, it's not necessarily that.

388
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,360
It just looks like... like a generic platformer game.

389
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,920
And I know it's not really generic because it was probably one of the first better platformer

390
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,120
games out there, but right now, it's not the type of game I'm into.

391
00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:00,320
And unfortunately, my game, you know, real estate, I guess, is too packed right now.

392
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,880
I have too many games I have to play in a short amount of time.

393
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,720
And Saints of R2 is gonna be coming out, and I won't give a shit about this game when Saints

394
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
of R2 comes out.

395
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,760
Kiki Nico in chat says, Rob, it's one of the best on Nintendo 64.

396
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
I understand.

397
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
I realize that.

398
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
It's just I never got around to it.

399
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080
Do either of you ladies have an opinion on Banjo-Kazooie?

400
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,200
I never liked it.

401
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Why?

402
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Same thing?

403
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
You never liked Banjo-Kazooie?

404
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Well, no.

405
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,040
I mean, this is also coming from the person who just, what, a couple years ago was ranting

406
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
and raving about Magic Pen-Gel.

407
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,920
Yeah, Magic Pen-Gel is fucking awesome.

408
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
I still say that in the other one.

409
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,720
With a penis monster that squirts.

410
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Wow.

411
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
We're so mature.

412
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,440
But I just never cared for how the game plays.

413
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
That's just me.

414
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,520
I never liked the sort of... it was like, it would be more fun if it was actually side,

415
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,480
but it was that behind view that just didn't seem very fun to me.

416
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Wow.

417
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Interesting that none of...

418
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,320
I mean, I don't really have a hate or like opinion on it.

419
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,120
I just flat out never really played it.

420
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,000
Interesting, though, that overall in studio here we're negative.

421
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,200
But to balance this out, there's positive in chat.

422
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,800
Frisbee says Banjo-Kazooie equals heart.

423
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,720
Kikaniko says they're not liking this BK Bash cast.

424
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,120
I'm not bashing the game.

425
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,080
It's just like, I don't want to play it.

426
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,280
It just doesn't look like something I would enjoy.

427
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,440
Here's a question I'll ask you, though, is that one place that Microsoft's really been

428
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,240
struggling is appealing to the family demographic.

429
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,840
They've always kind of been the hardcore gaming system.

430
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,840
This is a lot better than Rocky and Bullwinkle or the fucking crappy SpongeBob game that

431
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
they had on there.

432
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,000
Or, wasn't there like a Shrek game on there, too?

433
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah.

434
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Either way, those all sucked.

435
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,600
I'd rather have, like, you know, you're gonna have kids playing an Xbox Live or a K-game,

436
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
perfect.

437
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
This would be perfect for them.

438
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Alright.

439
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,000
Don't let them play that crappy, like, SpongeBob crap.

440
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,080
That Rocky and Bullwinkle game was very disappointing.

441
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,600
Especially, you know, if you love Rocky and Bullwinkle, too, it just pains you to look

442
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
at that game.

443
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,960
It's just, that may have been good in, like, the 80s or earlier.

444
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,000
I mean, it's just now, it's like they tried to bring back, what was that, the, um, what

445
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,240
was the race game, Wacky Races.

446
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,480
Wacky Races is great.

447
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,360
Yeah, Wacky Races is great for the people that remember it.

448
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,680
Kids do not know what the fuck Wacky Races is.

449
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,760
I don't even think I know what Wacky Races is.

450
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,720
I barely know what Wacky Races is.

451
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,320
Wacky Races was also in the same tone as the Laugh-Olympics.

452
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
Remember that?

453
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
No.

454
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,120
All the Hanna-Barbera characters in big competitions, only Wacky Races is...

455
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Oh!

456
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Okay, yes, I remember now.

457
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Okay.

458
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Okay.

459
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
I personally preferred the Laugh-Olympics.

460
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,680
It's, it's kinda like the Justice League of these types of cartoons, right?

461
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,480
But it was all Hanna-Barbera, so you had the Great Grape Ape and...

462
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,580
Yes, yes, yes, and, and, yeah, Huckleberry Hound and all those people were doing Battle

463
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,580
with the Flintstones.

464
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,580
I love Hanna-Barbera.

465
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
I just didn't...

466
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,360
Yeah, but see, that wasn't in this one, though.

467
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,000
At least this game did not have, like, the Flintstones or anything.

468
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Any...

469
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't know.

470
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Original...

471
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,560
I think the licensing fee for a game like that would be nuts.

472
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,080
Dark Tetsuya says there should be a Laugh-Olympics video game.

473
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
I just couldn't imagine...

474
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
That might be cool.

475
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,760
But the licensing fee would be atrocious, I would think.

476
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,640
Well, it's all Hanna-Barbera, so I would think that the Laugh-Olympics...

477
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Laugh-Olympics would probably be a lot better than Wacky Races.

478
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,480
Wacky Races sucked, so...

479
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,360
All right, that's that.

480
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,800
Well, the news about Banjo-Kazooie was really big news this week, but there was other big

481
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,440
news, especially in the legal world this week, and I'm talking about Spore.

482
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,160
And you know, the DRM in Spore has been a very controversial point of order where, you

483
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,920
know, you can only install the game on so many systems and, of course, secure ROM, right?

484
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,040
Very controversial device, if you haven't heard of it, which I don't see how you could

485
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,400
not have by now.

486
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,680
It's that thing that kind of installs on your computer to kind of monitor what's going in

487
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
the...

488
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
I don't even...

489
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
What is the point of secure ROM?

490
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,640
How does it install into your computer?

491
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,040
What exactly are they looking for?

492
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,320
I guess to make sure you're not burning a copy of the game or something?

493
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,720
I don't know.

494
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,280
Well, obviously some folks are...

495
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,720
It doesn't work very well.

496
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,040
I mean, if I didn't want to play Spore Online, I could easily crack that stupid code with

497
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,960
one little patch, but unfortunately I've already installed it on my system, and not that it

498
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,800
really matters, I'm not playing the game anyway, so...

499
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Whatever.

500
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,600
Well, a class action lawsuit has been filed against Electronic Arts this week over that

501
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,400
DRM, and specifically kind of targeting secure ROM.

502
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,960
This class action lawsuit is claiming that Spore contains, quote, a second undisclosed

503
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,360
program called secure ROM, a form of digital rights management for computer games.

504
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,880
Consumers are not warned about the program.

505
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,160
The program installs without any notice, and they cannot uninstall the program either.

506
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,960
The program is, quote, secretly installed at the command and control center of the computer,

507
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,920
including zero, or the kernel, and surreptitiously operated, overseeing function and operation

508
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,740
on the computer, preventing the computer from operating under certain circumstances and

509
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,240
or disrupting hardware operations.

510
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,720
So it was a class action lawsuit filed against Electronic Arts who's put this game out there

511
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,280
basically saying, you are installing a second program without my consent on my computer.

512
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,680
That's basically the core of it.

513
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
And I agree with that.

514
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,480
I agree that that makes sense, because they aren't saying, hey, we're installing this

515
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,560
on here, or giving you a way to uninstall it, say, if you uninstall the game.

516
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,000
It stays on your computer forever.

517
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What do you guys think?

518
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,640
What will become of this lawsuit?

519
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,460
And I pose this question to our chat room as well.

520
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,180
Do you think this lawsuit has any merit?

521
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,440
Is this a sue-happy America?

522
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,640
What's going to happen, you think?

523
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Settlement?

524
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,000
Any thoughts?

525
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,440
Honestly, I think that they're going to have to settle, at least just to get people to

526
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,240
shut up.

527
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,760
But there's other companies have been doing this for ages.

528
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:49,080
For example, I think Dell does the DNA program, I think, to see if you're, God, I can't remember

529
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,840
what exactly it's about, but they install a program.

530
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,380
But then again, I guess if you buy a Dell, you know you're eventually going to get this

531
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,600
on there.

532
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,280
But there should have, I, what?

533
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,240
I was just going to say that probably they're not going to end up getting any money out

534
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
of this.

535
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,320
I was just going to be agreeing that, and I think this has happened in the past with

536
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,400
other games that had secure ROM, where the agreement was that there is an uninstall program,

537
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,280
but you have to get it from secure ROM to uninstall the game.

538
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,200
But they keep changing the version, so it doesn't work, I don't think, anymore.

539
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,000
I know it's not easy to uninstall it.

540
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,440
I think that there should have been something in the manual, or maybe just like a little

541
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,240
icon on the box that, you know, has like some sort of secure ROM logo on it or something.

542
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
Something that, you know.

543
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,000
I happen to have the box right here.

544
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,120
Dude, I'm sorry, I just have to interrupt with something hilarious.

545
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
Please, that's why you're here.

546
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,080
I was just, like, I was reading an article about how You-Know-Who was disbarred, and

547
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,160
somebody made a cake and wrote, Dear You-Know-Who, Congrats on the disbarment, you douchebag.

548
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,000
Hold on, you're getting to the next story, you're getting a little ahead.

549
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
That's all right.

550
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,540
I'm looking at the box, and I'm looking at the inside of the box.

551
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,720
It's a little, you know, what's all in the game.

552
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,200
I'm looking at the back of the box.

553
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,840
I'm even looking at the fine print that gives the system requirements.

554
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,640
Internet connection is required.

555
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,520
EA terms and conditions and feature updates can be found at www.ea.com.

556
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,040
I don't see the word secure ROM anywhere here on this box.

557
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,400
So they don't tell you.

558
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,360
I honestly, I do honestly think.

559
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,960
I mean, you know, the primary rule is let the buyer beware, but still, I think that

560
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,040
if they are going to install something without your knowledge, when you think you're getting

561
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,720
a game and all of a sudden you're getting, you know, this other business, even though

562
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,440
it's to protect their information, I honestly think that there should be some sort of warning

563
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,180
so that the buyer can be aware and not beware, you know what I mean?

564
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,600
And not have to rely strictly on Amazon reviews.

565
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Exactly.

566
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,520
The other thing too, I mean, does your copy of Warhammer have secure ROM on it, because

567
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
it's also EA?

568
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
Who knows?

569
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
I don't know.

570
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,520
I mean, I'm looking at the box for Warhammer, which I also happen to have right here, and

571
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,440
I don't think I see anything on here either, but then again, would I?

572
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Probably not.

573
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,920
Although I do notice a lot of the very same blah blah blah on here that I saw in the other

574
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
box.

575
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Yeah.

576
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I don't know.

577
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,280
I don't like the idea that, I mean, I don't have a problem with a program that's making

578
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,400
sure my copy of the game I'm running is legit.

579
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,920
That's fine.

580
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,640
But the problem is, this program also is supposed to mess up your CD burning software or something

581
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
like that.

582
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:39,100
Luckily, it hasn't with mine, because I've been able to burn DVDs quite easy with it.

583
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,160
You know, Jernami has a good point in our chat room.

584
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,080
Warhammer doesn't need secure ROM.

585
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,080
It is impossible to play, well, I mean, I guess never say never, but virtually impossible

586
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,800
to play this game without buying your own copy, because it being an MMO, you have to

587
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,240
have a key to go online and play the game, and it needs an internet connection by nature,

588
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
so it's very easily verifiable.

589
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,320
It doesn't matter.

590
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
It's a game.

591
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
It's a cop.

592
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,960
I mean, they do that with Final Fantasy XI.

593
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,800
You have to have a copy, you know, a content code or something like that to prove that

594
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,080
you bought the game, so I don't know.

595
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,520
Tigerclaw asked, did the end user license agreement state anything about copy protection?

596
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,120
It may not mention about secure ROM.

597
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,040
22 Tigerclaw said it did not.

598
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Hmm, interesting.

599
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,920
Even if it did, I think they might have a claim that it's not visible enough.

600
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,440
You know, how many people really read those end user license agreements?

601
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
I don't know.

602
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
Who knows?

603
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,840
Bobby says he has, Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy before us here on All Games Radio, says the

604
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,680
Galactic Edition box also does not state secure ROM.

605
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,120
He has the special edition.

606
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,000
Let's see, Frisbee says people actually checked the end user license agreement and never saw

607
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
secure ROM.

608
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,400
Frisbee had another really good point here earlier.

609
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,760
I'm trying to find it.

610
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,760
You have to tell people when you install stuff in a PC, it's an invasion of piracy.

611
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,720
Tigerclaw also says this, I hope this lawsuit goes through because digital rights management

612
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,040
is bad enough as it is.

613
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,160
I wonder though, when you install the game, there's probably an end user, and that's where

614
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,520
that second discussion went on.

615
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
It's spyware.

616
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,000
It's a spyware or trojan, basically, because it's a program that's being installed without

617
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,360
you knowing, and that is just not right.

618
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,680
Do you remember years ago when CDs, I believe it was Sony, question mark, that they're

619
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
very rootkit.

620
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
That's it.

621
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Rootkit was what it was called.

622
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,560
There was a big stink over that, and they had to end up either replacing disks or something,

623
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
wasn't it?

624
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,240
Well, they had to put an uninstall program out there for this, and people found out you

625
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,160
could get around this by drawing a line with a Sharpie pen on your disk to basically fuck

626
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,640
up the data track on your CD, because data tracks go at the end.

627
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,520
It's a little different, I guess.

628
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,360
Yeah, but here's the crazy thing about that.

629
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,400
I was actually reading about rootkit on Wikipedia not that long ago.

630
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:55,080
Did you know that not only could you go to the website to get the program, the Windows

631
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
official...

632
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,360
You know how Windows has their own spyware removal program or whatever that comes out

633
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
every month?

634
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,200
Sometimes you see it in Windows Update.

635
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,160
The rootkit removal ended up being a part of that months later, so I just always thought

636
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,760
that was kind of fascinating.

637
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,240
Very interesting, and yeah, Game Guru says it's a rootkit, and no one warned it.

638
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,040
I'm wondering if this is going to go along the same route.

639
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,200
To me, that rootkit thing kind of set a precedent in this regard.

640
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,440
That's where I think that, yeah, this might be justified because you're installing extra

641
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
shit that someone didn't ask for.

642
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
So...

643
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,760
Well, if they're going to follow by previous, because I do believe that, isn't it, once

644
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,440
it hits the federal level, if it's gone through court, what, at least three times, that it

645
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,080
becomes a basically, oh, God, I can't remember.

646
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,080
I took that law class a long time ago.

647
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,520
I'll get what you're saying, though.

648
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,640
But usually, if there's been a prior precedent set for it, they tend to stick by previous

649
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
rulings.

650
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
All right.

651
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,400
Well, if you have some thoughts on this, you can join us in our chat room, or you can always

652
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
send us an email.

653
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Mailbagorangelawnatradio.com.

654
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,560
And we'll let Rob read it.

655
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,760
All right.

656
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Let's move on with the news.

657
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,320
I know Tiara gave us a hint of what's to come, but please, Dark Soccer, give us the wonderful,

658
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,880
glorious news that happened this week.

659
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,960
In baking news, there's been cakes made regarding...

660
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
No.

661
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:23,600
Well, as stated by Sauce earlier, we have no more of he-who-shall-not-be-named practicing

662
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
law.

663
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,320
He has been permanently disbarred, and he's already throwing a hissy fit.

664
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:35,720
And going, wah, over the whole thing.

665
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,160
He's basically saying that it's a retaliation for a book he wrote about the Florida Supreme

666
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:56,720
Court trying to get past this faith-based activism against the American entertainment

667
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
industry.

668
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,360
He's quoted as saying this rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal

669
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:09,960
suit with enemies this foolish Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has.

670
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
That's his statement.

671
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
I love this.

672
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,320
Act Deaf in Chat is suggesting that we shall change the name from he-who-shall-not-be-named

673
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,560
to he-who-shall-not-practice law.

674
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,680
I endorse this.

675
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,320
I endorse it as well.

676
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
Loki?

677
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
I'm fine with that.

678
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
All right.

679
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
There it is.

680
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
His new name is...

681
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
I just hope we don't have to talk to him anymore.

682
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
He-who-shall-not-practice law.

683
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,040
I know it is getting a little old, isn't it?

684
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
Yeah.

685
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
It's already been.

686
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,040
It was a little old a long time ago.

687
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,680
Just though, and this is what I was saying when Bobby made his call to us earlier, is,

688
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:48,280
I mean, keep in mind, this is the same guy who went after Two Life Crew back in the day,

689
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:54,200
went after Ice-T for his cop-killer thing, and basically, as far as I'm concerned, this

690
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,040
man is anti-First Amendment.

691
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,280
You know what he needs to refocus his efforts on?

692
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,000
Like reality TV shows that appear on MTV, like The Real World and The Hills, those need

693
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,400
to be taken off TV.

694
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,560
Even more, though, going back to what I was trying to say about, I don't think he's specifically

695
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,400
anti-First Amendment.

696
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,760
He's pro-First Amendment as long as it's whatever he wants to say, you know?

697
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,800
As long as it's his personal agenda, which actually, I don't even know so much that it's

698
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,080
his own personal agenda as much as it's something that he found out that he can make money on.

699
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,400
In other words, it's kind of like, here, and here's a visual for you, Justin TV folks.

700
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:41,680
Here's he who shall not practice law, and here's the world revolving around him in his

701
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
mind.

702
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Exactly.

703
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:50,600
I'm actually, like I was saying earlier, I think this is a long time coming ever since,

704
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,800
you know, the late 80s.

705
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,360
God, what is this now, 20 years this has been coming?

706
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:04,840
I'm finally glad to see, you know, basically the duct tape thrown over his mouth and, you

707
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,600
know, hopefully he'll stop bitching and realize that no one really cares.

708
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Maybe he'll take up knitting.

709
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Huh?

710
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
We'll see.

711
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
I said maybe he'll take up knitting.

712
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
We'll see.

713
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:23,640
He'd be, you know, knitting, I guess, restraints for people that he thinks offends him or something.

714
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,840
The ex Jason XV says, Dark Sakura, people need to learn to be offended.

715
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,680
Exactly.

716
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Including this guy.

717
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,000
I suppose this is the biggest offense ever, huh?

718
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:42,400
He's like, the Florida people don't like me because I wrote a mean book about them.

719
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,120
No, they disbarred you because you're a big fucking moron.

720
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,120
The end.

721
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,880
Well, you know what?

722
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,560
I know it's a little early.

723
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,820
We usually don't get to this segment this early in the show, but you know, usually whenever

724
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,320
we bring up a story about he who shall not practice law on this program, it's immediately

725
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,440
followed by a very regular segment of ours.

726
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,520
One last time, seeing as hopefully, hopefully we'll never have a story about this guy again,

727
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:31,600
for real real, one more time, the FUs of the week, as inspired by a story about this guy.

728
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:38,960
I have a multiple part FU, and it begins with a certain event that occurred on Tuesday.

729
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,680
On Tuesday, I was driving school, mining my own and paying attention to the road and then

730
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,840
crash.

731
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:54,760
The silver Lancer of love is now the totaled out silver Lancer of death.

732
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
It is gone.

733
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
R.I.P.

734
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Lancer.

735
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
My baby.

736
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,760
My poor, poor baby.

737
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,000
Um, however, um, yeah, and I did actually end up hurting my hip kind of bad.

738
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,320
I've been kind of limping about, um, but I'm going to see my craft director next week,

739
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,960
which is Poppy.

740
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:18,840
And then as my week progresses, Dan ends up going into the hospital for, I had to spend

741
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:25,480
like what, three, four hours in the ER with Dan with his knee being sprained.

742
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,600
So it just, it was just sort of one thing after another, but everything was happy when

743
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,160
I went to the airport and picked up sauce.

744
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,080
It's been great, except for this morning when I had to spend four hours, the car dealership

745
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,280
signing papers and it was the signing papers part that took longer than the test driving

746
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
part.

747
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:53,580
However, I now have, um, a happy, um, Toyota vibe as in matrix with a Pontiac exterior.

748
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,480
Now the big question is what are you going to name it?

749
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,360
Cause your last car was Vic Viper, right?

750
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,640
Well, my last car, piano last car wasn't Vic Viper and the one before that was the Twendy.

751
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,000
So what's this one going to be now?

752
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,320
Whatever the ship in our type is, Dan suggested that it should be Raider.

753
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:16,480
That way she would have a Toyota or Pontiac vibrator.

754
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,160
I get it.

755
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,480
Maybe that'll be it's, it's a, it's secrets, but I'm, it's not Lord British cause it's

756
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
not red.

757
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,520
Dan pointed that out to me cause I was going to name it Lord British.

758
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Nice.

759
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,380
You know, one letter, if you named it ribbon, it'd be one letter away from Vib ribbon.

760
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,300
All right, you shouldn't name it.

761
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:42,380
I know what, what was, um, I'll name it, um, Mojib ribbon cause my car is kind of beige

762
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,640
and all of Mojib ribbon was parchment colored.

763
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
I don't know.

764
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,600
I like, it's the trans vibrator.

765
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
There we go.

766
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Thank you.

767
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Act of death.

768
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
It's the chance.

769
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
The trans vibrator.

770
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,400
My car's name is rez.

771
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Your car's name is rez.

772
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
My car's name is rez.

773
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
All right.

774
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,520
That's the second thing Act F's contributed tonight.

775
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,800
That's pretty big.

776
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Two pretty big deals.

777
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,840
Add it on the Wiki.

778
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
My car has a name.

779
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
All right.

780
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
There you go.

781
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:18,400
Uh, Loki, your FUs of the week, uh, my FU week goes to, uh, your aunt and, um, they're

782
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
annoying.

783
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Hey, what did my aunt do to you?

784
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,760
She's sitting in a house in the middle of Elk Grove somewhere.

785
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Just tend into the pigs.

786
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,920
Hey, well that aunt's fine, but the other hundred that you have underneath this floor

787
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,720
here that kind of sucked.

788
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,520
I put the food or I should say the trash next to the mixing board.

789
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,520
So if the sound starts to go out and we notice a big hoard of ants, we'll know why.

790
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
All right.

791
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:47,600
Uh, my FU of the week goes to my gallbladder because it sucks and it's like, I don't like

792
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
you Rob.

793
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,960
I'm going to get all inflaming and stuff inside you and you're going to have to have a surgery

794
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
to take me out.

795
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Thankfully.

796
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Gallbladder surgery is no big deal.

797
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,760
I've had plenty of people reassure me it's not a big deal.

798
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,960
It's just, you know, just the method of it all and having to get all the pre screenings

799
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,520
and having to go through, I'm going to be in bed for two weeks, which is going to suck

800
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,600
because I won't be able to do the show among other things, but I should be able to get

801
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,080
a whole lot of DS playing in at that time because you'll notice I haven't reviewed a

802
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,480
DS game on this program in like six months, so that's going to be the blessing about gallbladder

803
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,640
surgery is dammit, I'm going to catch up on every single handheld game I've been waiting

804
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,780
to catch up on in a long freaking time.

805
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,520
So if you do the gallbladder for hating me, sadly enough, Rob's gallbladder is easier

806
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,760
to remove and secure off.

807
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,960
You've been sitting here all night long with that punchline, haven't you?

808
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
You've been waiting just the last minute.

809
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Asshole.

810
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
All right.

811
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,400
Tara, do you have any FUs of the week?

812
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,840
I would just like to say to Drew that you suck for not coming to my brunch yesterday.

813
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,560
So FU, Drew, for ruining my vacation by being a loser and not showing up.

814
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Aww.

815
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
How sad.

816
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,560
All right.

817
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,120
There you go, FUs of the week.

818
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,400
Nate432 says, Rob, you need to give the PSP some more love.

819
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,000
I do love the PSP, and you know I'm going to love it a whole lot more when it's the

820
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,440
only way I can watch movies for a couple weeks.

821
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,920
So hey, PSP is the perfect post-surgery device.

822
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
There you go.

823
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
How's that?

824
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Fantastic.

825
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,280
New games all in one.

826
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280
There's your PSP love.

827
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
All right.

828
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
All right.

829
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,360
Securom is the new Gator, says Jirnami.

830
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Remember Gator?

831
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
Yeah, I remember Gator.

832
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
Good stuff.

833
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
Gator sucked.

834
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Gator doesn't.

835
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
What ever happened to Gator?

836
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,360
It's probably still around.

837
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,600
I'm going to look that up on Wikipedia right now.

838
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
All right.

839
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Meanwhile, another story.

840
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:47,800
Meanwhile, tomorrow or today or whenever you're having a listen to this, Monday, September

841
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:55,600
29th, Xbox Live Arcade will be, or Xbox Live completely, will be down the entire day.

842
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:06,880
24 hours so that they can do some necessary improvements to prep for the next Xbox experience,

843
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,640
or new Xbox experience, with all the fancy avatars and other crap that they're adding

844
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
to it.

845
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,280
So that's not the day that it's coming out, but it will be the day that they're working

846
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
on stuff.

847
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:26,720
So you'll have to find some offline games to play during that time.

848
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,960
Wow.

849
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,760
This is crazy that Gator got brought up tonight.

850
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,720
There's actually some very recent news about Gator.

851
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,080
I'm reading here on Wikipedia.

852
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Okay.

853
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,760
Gator was run by a company called the Claria Corporation, was the people behind Gator.

854
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,400
And there was a whole lot of back and forth.

855
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,640
You know, there was that Gator.

856
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,680
And to make a long story short, Gator was like some freaking program that installed

857
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,920
itself on your computer, basically, that would just pop ads up all over.

858
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,080
Like wasn't that stupid weather bug thing part of this?

859
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,680
Like they would try to give you some dumb little program that would sneak Gator on there

860
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
as part of it.

861
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,920
Well, yeah, that was it.

862
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,200
It was no weather scope, precision time.

863
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
That was it.

864
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,520
Is the time on your computer accurate?

865
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,840
That was their big thing.

866
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
Okay.

867
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,080
Well, here's the thing.

868
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,480
You know, there was this all back and forth stuff.

869
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,640
In 2006, Claria said they were going to exit the adware business and focus on search technology.

870
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,120
Well, here's the thing.

871
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:25,080
September 26, 2008, two days ago, Jelly Cloud, which is what Claria changed its name to in

872
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:30,880
June, has laid off all its employees, shut down all operations, and has liquidated all

873
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
assets.

874
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,960
So, Gator officially bid it this week.

875
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,160
How do you like that for like late breaking news?

876
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,040
And I would have never known if we didn't joke about it on tonight's show.

877
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,760
So Xbox Live down for a full day, really?

878
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Yeah.

879
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,240
I had to make the preparations last week.

880
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,300
So we're ready to go back to playing System Link Saints Row 1.

881
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,520
That's what we're going to do on Monday.

882
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,480
I have to go a full day without Rock Band?

883
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,200
What am I going to do?

884
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
I'm just kidding.

885
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,120
Is Xbox Live going down a whole day really that big a deal?

886
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,120
I don't think so.

887
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,840
It won't be the end of the world.

888
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,080
It is a big deal if you happen to, I don't know, have a new system that requires you

889
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:21,240
to be logged into Xbox Live so that it knows that you purchased certain things.

890
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,400
Otherwise they show up as demos or just don't work.

891
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:33,760
Oh yeah, that'll be bad for those folks that haven't done the resetting of their licenses

892
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
and all that stuff.

893
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,280
Yeah, let's play more Mercenaries 2.

894
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
All right.

895
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,760
And watch Heroes.

896
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,440
You know, one thing that also can happen when Xbox Live is down is that your games can patch.

897
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,860
And I don't know if you guys have heard about this, but Fable 2 is coming out very soon.

898
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,160
And Fable 2 is actually going to be having no co-op the day it launches, which is kind

899
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
of interesting.

900
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,560
They're going to have to patch it into the game.

901
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,120
They say they're going to do it a week after the release, but it's actually not going to

902
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
be in the game.

903
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,340
And for those of you guys that listen to Bobby Black Wolf Show, who he's on right before

904
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,040
us on AllGames.com, we actually talked about this at length in the Tossover segment at

905
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,960
the end of his show this week.

906
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,240
But in a nutshell, one thing I suggested is that reviewers should simply not review the

907
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,960
co-op part of the game because it's not a part of the game at its release.

908
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,000
But it's a very tricky area right now because there really is no kind of ethical standard

909
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,440
set as to what should and should not be in the game when it's released.

910
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,400
MMOs, they're always constantly patching.

911
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,080
Look at a game like Burnout Paradise.

912
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Burnout Paradise has kind of reinvented itself several times since the game launched, and

913
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,640
that's been overall a good thing.

914
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,680
But at the same time, Burnout Paradise didn't advertise that motorbikes were going to be

915
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,880
in the game before its release.

916
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
That was kind of an added bonus.

917
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Yes.

918
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
Loki, what do you think?

919
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,360
Because I think you got in late and you didn't get to give your opinion on that on Bobby

920
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
Show.

921
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,080
Well, I think it's just retarded that games come out nowadays and require patching out

922
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,000
the door or patching weeks later because they're not done.

923
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,200
That would be like saying, oh, hey, you know that movie that came out?

924
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,840
You're going to go to theaters and see it?

925
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,880
Yeah, we're going to patch in the ending later.

926
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,880
I mean, it's just getting to the point now where developers don't need to finish their

927
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,720
product before it hits the market because they want to get it out at a certain time.

928
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,200
Well, you know, if you want to get it at a certain time, maybe you should have worked

929
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,200
harder.

930
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,800
Well, here's a thought.

931
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,800
If they had never teased this as being an element of the game, I...

932
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,280
It would have looked really awesome.

933
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,240
It would have looked really awesome when it finally came out.

934
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,200
So in a way, I think the lesson to be learned here is don't tempt us with things that you're

935
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,400
not going to be able to, because this is the kind of stories that are going to happen,

936
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
you know?

937
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,720
Otherwise, people would have been none the wiser.

938
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,080
I bet you there still would have been a lot of anticipation over Fable 2 because, you

939
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,400
know, Fable did have its fans on Xbox One, you know?

940
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,520
So just kind of a lesson to be learned, I suppose.

941
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,360
But still, at least they are patching it that soon.

942
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,360
At least it's not coming like a year later.

943
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
We hope.

944
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
This is in theory.

945
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
Yeah.

946
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,120
I mean, there are a lot of games that are put out by certain companies like EA that

947
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:07,320
come out flawed and patches don't come that quick at all.

948
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:12,560
And I find it hard to believe that, oops, we just didn't catch some of these bugs, Mercenaries

949
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,880
2.

950
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,440
It's just... it's lazy.

951
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,440
It really is.

952
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,960
Let's cut costs with QA.

953
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,960
How about that?

954
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
All right.

955
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,880
Well, unfortunately, because online co-op is not in the game when it launches, some

956
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,280
of the achievements might be a little harder to get, which is also very interesting about

957
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,800
the achievements in Fable 2.

958
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,980
Most of them you can either do yourself or watch someone else do, and it will unlock

959
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,980
the achievement.

960
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,240
For example, there's an achievement worth 10 points in the game called the romantic.

961
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,020
Take a villager on a perfect date or tag along to one, meaning that it looks like most achievements

962
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,520
will be obtainable in co-op modes as well, which is kind of interesting because, you

963
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,980
know, is that part of the programming where I guess once the trigger's hit, it's hit no

964
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:58,680
matter who did it, or was that something that was always intended to try and get more people

965
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,300
to play the game together or whatever?

966
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,960
Kind of interesting, I suppose.

967
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,120
It'll make it a little easier to actually get all the achievements, and it should be

968
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:14,320
noted, not all of them can you do with another person as well, but a good chunk of them can

969
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,400
be done co-op or single player mode, which is kind of interesting.

970
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:24,880
Fable 2, despite all the blah blah blah about the online co-op, I'll probably still get

971
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,880
the game when it comes out.

972
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,880
I actually enjoyed the first game.

973
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,160
I had fun with it, so I'm looking forward to the second game as well.

974
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,440
Quick comments from chat room.

975
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,240
There's quite a few comments coming in here.

976
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,400
Bobby Blackwell says, I've never heard of a movie being taken out of the theaters to

977
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,360
be given a new ending and put back in theaters.

978
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Wait, wait, wait.

979
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,360
I have.

980
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,360
I have.

981
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,360
28 Days Later.

982
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
Remember?

983
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,920
They re-released it with like the additional ending or the special ending?

984
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
Yeah.

985
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Sometimes they do.

986
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
I mean, you know, I get the point.

987
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,080
I think he's trying to say that you're doing an apples and oranges thing with that comparison,

988
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,920
but they do sometimes re-release movies with extra crap to try and get people to go see

989
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,920
it a second time.

990
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,360
Or completely change it all around, thank you George Lucas.

991
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,400
But I guess that's true.

992
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
Let's see.

993
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,200
Gerardo says, but are people really not going to play Fable 2 because there's no co-op in

994
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,200
it?

995
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,200
No.

996
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,200
I think not.

997
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,200
It's still Fable.

998
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,200
I think at the end of the day, he's right.

999
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,200
You're right.

1000
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,040
Anybody that was going to buy the game is still going to buy it because they know it

1001
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,040
is coming.

1002
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,280
And anybody that wasn't going to buy the game is just going to throw this onto the list

1003
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
of what they don't like.

1004
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,600
Hey, at least they came out and said that the online co-op isn't in there instead of

1005
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,680
releasing it with the online co-op and it doesn't work and then go, oops, we got to

1006
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,680
patch it later.

1007
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,680
True.

1008
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,680
So.

1009
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,680
Very true.

1010
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,680
Yeah.

1011
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,400
So, you know, honestly, at the end of the day, is this going to change anything about

1012
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,400
Fable 2?

1013
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,400
Probably not.

1014
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,400
Probably not.

1015
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,100
But will this maybe set a really bad precedent?

1016
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,100
That's what we're all kind of...

1017
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,200
I don't think so.

1018
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,600
The precedent's already been set a long time ago.

1019
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,960
I mean, now that we have consoles that can patch games, that doesn't mean that the game

1020
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,480
has to come out perfect.

1021
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,200
And not that it really mattered before that either, so.

1022
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,020
But I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of the games that came out before the 360

1023
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:10,240
and stuff like that, there weren't as many glitches and problems because they spent

1024
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,440
more time testing them and making sure that they worked right.

1025
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,840
And now it doesn't matter because if people discover glitches later on, eh, we'll just

1026
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,080
go and fix it.

1027
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,980
I think that's kind of lazy and it kind of sucks that you buy a product and it doesn't

1028
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,840
work correctly because of sheer laziness.

1029
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,820
Sounds like there will be a lot of people that want to call in and talk about this later.

1030
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,440
We got to keep it moving, though.

1031
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,960
We're getting into the show here and we got a lot of stories to still cover, like whatever

1032
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,680
Dark Soccer's going to talk about next.

1033
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,320
Well, it looks like, you know how people were saying that the 360 wasn't necessarily so

1034
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:50,940
popular in Japan, but it looks like it's overtook the PS3, actually, again.

1035
00:48:50,940 --> 00:49:01,340
With the recent price cut, it went down, it actually managed to get out 13,777 units as

1036
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:05,520
opposed to PS3's 8,156.

1037
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,880
So it's seriously giving it the smackdown.

1038
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:17,680
However, in software titles, it's still basically in Nintendo's pocket.

1039
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,680
For software, Pokemon Platinum is the top seller, then Dragon Ball Origins, Rythmton

1040
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:30,960
Goku Gold, and yeah, the top three are all DS games, followed by Trusty Bell's Chopin's

1041
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,160
Dream on PS3, the reprise.

1042
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,880
So Microsoft really needs to be praising whatever deity they believe in for Tales of Vesperia

1043
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,040
right about now, right?

1044
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,040
Pretty much.

1045
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,080
Well, following down even the next two games after that are more Nintendo games, Quiz Magic

1046
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:53,280
Academy DS and Wii Fit are 5 and 6, respectively.

1047
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:01,020
7 is a Katekyo Hitman Reborn Battle Arena on PSP, 8 is with Samurai Portable PSP, 9

1048
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,440
One Piece Unlimited Cruise on Wii, and then Mario Kart Wii.

1049
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:12,880
So it's very much dominated by Nintendo, but as far as hardware sales, number one is the

1050
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:19,300
DS, 2 is the Wii, 3 is PSP, 4 is Xbox 360, 5 is PS3, and 6 is PS2, which is actually

1051
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:24,800
still impressive, selling over 7,000 units.

1052
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,040
Interesting comment from chat, and I apologize in advance for horribly mispronouncing your

1053
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,760
name, which I'm sure I'm going to do.

1054
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,600
Nefestus says, I love the fact that 360 outselling PS3 in Japan for a week is news.

1055
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,440
It kind of is, in a way.

1056
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,000
I mean, it really is that, wow, the 360, because a lot of folks say, oh, Xbox is failing in

1057
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,800
Japan, Microsoft is failing, they don't know what they're doing, da da da, or that it's

1058
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,800
never going to sell in Japan.

1059
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,800
And then finally, it takes one really, really good game for that audience to really start

1060
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,800
moving these systems.

1061
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,380
And it is, the turnaround is somewhat, it's somewhat notable.

1062
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,460
This is, the question is, will it have momentum, or is this just going to be a one hit, one

1063
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,460
trick pony?

1064
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:11,160
Well, still though, I mean, that's more than twice as many units that went out, so.

1065
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:18,720
I want to say that perhaps if, you know, if basically, it does have to do with Squeenix

1066
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:26,540
support, if I think that they might put the effort into trying to get more of those major

1067
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,700
party developers, at least for the Japanese market, to try to get more things on their

1068
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,600
systems, you know, that might help them out in the long run if they can keep that kind

1069
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,600
of support.

1070
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,240
Yeah, if only they can, I think they need to throw a lot of money at Capcom to get the

1071
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,640
next, like, another Monster Hunter game, exclusive for the 360, that'll sell plenty of systems.

1072
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,080
Or Fire Emblem.

1073
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,800
Fire Emblem will never be on that system.

1074
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,120
I mean, not Fire Emblem, yep.

1075
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,120
Because that's a Nintendo title.

1076
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,120
I don't know what I was thinking.

1077
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,120
Actually, what you were saying, so.

1078
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,120
Let's get the name mixed up.

1079
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,120
Alright.

1080
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,120
Alright, let's move on.

1081
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:11,280
Let's see here, this week there was an interesting countdown done by Bungie on the anniversary

1082
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:19,360
of Halo 3, and kind of went back to the whole E3 announcement, or that never really happened,

1083
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:27,920
and what we got after the countdown was done is a teaser for a Halo 3 campaign expansion.

1084
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:35,160
And we know this because on Xbox Live, the description for the video that's on there

1085
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,840
is a new Halo 3 campaign experience.

1086
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:45,160
But what exactly this experience will be, who knows.

1087
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,720
The thoughts are it's not going to be Master Chief as the main character, and actually

1088
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,280
they have a whole bunch of breakdown on the trailer and stuff.

1089
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:01,280
I know on Xbox, was it on 360, Fanboy, they had a pretty cool video breakdown there.

1090
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,760
Obsessive fans analyzing each and every frame.

1091
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,760
I know.

1092
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,760
Awesome.

1093
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,680
And then of course, along with analyzing every single frame, they thought that they found

1094
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,600
a date within the movie itself, and of course it was January 6, 09, which would be a Tuesday.

1095
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:21,680
So this might be possibly coming in January, I guess we'll have to see, but that's kind

1096
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,680
of exciting.

1097
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:27,240
At least they're going to be expanding the game some, in case it's gotten a little stale.

1098
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,280
Free expansion, hopefully?

1099
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,560
I don't think so, but I think this is actually kind of like the night, not the nights of

1100
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,120
the game, but like Shivering Isles or something like that, something of that size, because

1101
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,760
it's a whole new portion of the game.

1102
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,040
That's kind of neat to see something like that in a non-RPG type game, though.

1103
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,200
So it's kind of neat to see the extended life of the game, but something that should have

1104
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,840
been there to begin with, maybe?

1105
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,840
I don't think so.

1106
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,480
Because we were talking about things that come out long after the game's out.

1107
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,360
No, I don't think so, because this doesn't really tie in with the whole storyline of

1108
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,920
Halo 3, it's kind of something on top of it that's running in the Halo engine now.

1109
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,800
And that maybe is a little bit of backstory in-between Halo 2 and 3 or something?

1110
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,800
I don't know.

1111
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:13,200
To be honest, I've played Halo 2 a little bit, and Halo 1 multiplayer a little bit,

1112
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,480
but I never really actually played through the storylines of those.

1113
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,240
So I couldn't really tell you what the hell was going on in the trailers, but it looked

1114
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,240
cool.

1115
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:27,640
And it's interesting, I mean this will probably mean a lot more to a Halo fan.

1116
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,640
Alright well moving on in other kind of Halo related news, you might remember a few weeks

1117
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,640
ago Ensemble was shut down by Microsoft.

1118
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,400
They actually closed down Ensemble Studios, which was very sad for those people working

1119
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,400
there.

1120
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,240
Well now it's come to light, and for fans of Halo, they might be sad to learn that one

1121
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,840
of the things that Ensemble was working on, in fact probably the biggest thing they were

1122
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,800
working on, was a Halo MMO.

1123
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,180
They were working on a MMO centered in the Halo universe, and apparently even some pictures

1124
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,440
have surfaced from what the Halo MMO was supposed to look like.

1125
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,520
And it kind of looked like, wow, in the Halo universe.

1126
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,720
It's kind of interesting, it looked to be kind of simple like World of Warcraft is.

1127
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,060
Very similar layout for those that play Warcraft, or even Warhammer Online, actually the interface

1128
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,960
almost looks more like Warhammer Online to me.

1129
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,080
Kind of the way it is, you can see characters wheeling dual swords, as well as guns and

1130
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,080
all that stuff.

1131
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:23,760
So kind of sad that this project won't see the light of day, but I guess then again if

1132
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,960
the game wasn't very good, then maybe it's a good thing it doesn't see the light of day,

1133
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,960
because Halo is a franchise you don't want to put out a bad game under.

1134
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,760
Although say what you will about Halo 3, although I don't think Halo 3 is necessarily bad,

1135
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,160
it's just people wanted a little more out of it I suppose.

1136
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,760
So apparently though, keep in mind there are still plenty of other Halo projects in development,

1137
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,600
so sadly this MMO will not be one of them.

1138
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,680
But you never know, sometimes these things get completely redone somewhere else, you

1139
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,720
know what I mean?

1140
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,920
Like for instance Star Trek Online, look at that, a particular studio is making that,

1141
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,160
they kind of shut down, another company picked it up and is now going to be releasing it.

1142
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,360
So who knows?

1143
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,840
We'll see.

1144
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,680
Holy Shonen in chat puts it very simply, he says, I'm going to miss Ensemble.

1145
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:14,240
Oh sorry, sorry to pour salt in the wound there about the, it's very interesting too,

1146
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,840
you don't often hear about what these studios are necessarily working on, the secret projects,

1147
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,480
when these studios are closed.

1148
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,280
So it's kind of neat that we got to hear a little something about it.

1149
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,880
Going forward into our release date so that we can hear about things that are coming out,

1150
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,360
and some things that were cancelled.

1151
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:38,520
And for the UK we have on the 30th Cell Zenith coming out on PC, and then we have a few things

1152
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:43,840
for the 1st through the 3rd on the 1st, Mega Man 9 on Xbox 360, so you can go download

1153
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,440
that and it's super fun.

1154
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,880
On the 3rd there's Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway on PC, Dancing Stage Supernova 2,

1155
00:56:51,880 --> 00:57:00,560
Civilization 2, FIFA 09 on damn near everything, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations

1156
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,560
on DS after that, so.

1157
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:11,760
Cool, let's see, this week there is quite a bit coming out, not a lot of it's good,

1158
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,880
a lot of PC games, holy shit there's a lot of PC games.

1159
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,680
Anyways, for console stuff, we've got a re-release of some Mortal Kombat games in the Mortal

1160
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,640
Kombat collection, they'll be available on PS2.

1161
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:32,560
Also coming to the DS, Animal Paradise, yet another animal raising sim, hooray.

1162
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:38,880
Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, the Sonic DS made by Bioware, coming to the DS.

1163
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:47,000
And also Silent Hill Homecoming, coming to the PC, 360 and PS3 this week, pretty awesome.

1164
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Hype Mania, coming out on Wii, 360 and PC, I guess on the 360 maybe that's an Xbox Live

1165
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:04,280
Arcade game, I haven't heard that one, let's see here, there's a lot of games that I don't

1166
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:09,720
think are coming out, I'm not going off this list.

1167
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,120
Let's see, what else is coming out this week, I don't think there's a lot of other big titles,

1168
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,880
some miscellaneous DS games, Unsolved Crimes on the DS, which I actually played that a

1169
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:25,800
little bit as kind of an adventure game from Atari there, you solve crimes, not really

1170
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,820
like Ace Attorney or anything like that, but it's pretty cool.

1171
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,440
And DT Carnage on PSP, it's a car combat game.

1172
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:46,080
PC, let's see we've got a bunch of games coming out, some of the highlights though, let's

1173
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:55,400
see here, let me read this chat comment really quick because it's funny, I load for real.

1174
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,940
Act Def says Silent Hill got a 6.5 by IGN I think, it makes a little annoyed face.

1175
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:05,960
Frisbee says IGN gets a 6.5 sometimes, nice.

1176
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,120
Supposedly I guess on PC, and I thought this already came out already, but it says Limbo

1177
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:16,620
of the Lost is coming, and if you remember that god awful song they made, you guys listened

1178
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,840
to a little bit ago, yeah that was from that game.

1179
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:35,600
And lastly, let's see here, Sue Tycoon 2 Ultimate for PC, We Cheer on the Wii, and let's see

1180
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:42,040
here, lastly Harvest Moon, Tree of Tranquility on the Wii.

1181
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,160
Goodie, more Harvest Moon, yay.

1182
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:50,280
Alright, is that it, alright, let's move over to Japan where it's kind of a slower week,

1183
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,600
there's not a whole lot of new stuff coming out, but there is Raiden 4 coming out on the

1184
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,420
Xbox 360, so if you like your Raiden games, there's a brand new one, I didn't even know

1185
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,940
there was one in development, there you go, coming out on the 360.

1186
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:05,720
Moving over to the Playstation 3, not a lot of new stuff, but you do get some price reductions

1187
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,520
on Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion and Warhawk are moving into the best series, as well as, hey

1188
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,120
if you need it, a new Dust Guard filter coming out in black and white, Dust Guard Filter

1189
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,120
3.

1190
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,320
Dust Guard Filter 3?

1191
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,900
Yes, comes out this week.

1192
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,480
It's not Dust Cap 3?

1193
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,240
No, now it's Dust Guard Filter because it's a Playstation 3.

1194
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,680
Ah, Dust Guard Filter.

1195
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,840
There you have it.

1196
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:32,200
On the Nintendo Wii, Jikyu Powerful Major League 3 is the only new game coming out this

1197
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:36,720
week, it's a new game from Konami, comes out this week on the Nintendo Wii, so let's see

1198
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,440
if there's anything on the Playstation 2.

1199
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:44,160
There are some things on the Playstation 2, including Kanuchi Shiroki Tsubasa no Shuu

1200
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,120
coming regular and limited edition, that same Powerful Major League game also is coming

1201
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:54,640
out on the Playstation 2 as well, and the Magician's Academy comes out on Playstation

1202
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,360
2 in Japan this week.

1203
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:03,320
Moving on over to the handhelds, looking at the Nintendo DS, Unknown Soldier Mokuba no

1204
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:11,000
Hoku comes out this week in Japan, as well as Nakamura Sumikko Tettai Shidou Shintoic

1205
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,200
Test One High One Fun DS Lesson from the Rocket Company.

1206
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,960
I'm trying to figure out what exactly is the lesson that will be learned in this game.

1207
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,040
Let's see, it looks like it might be writing of some sort.

1208
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,040
Oh, it's English!

1209
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,880
It's English, learning English.

1210
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,880
Huh.

1211
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:33,080
So, probably not a game any of our listeners need if you're listening to this program.

1212
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,460
And let's check out the PSP real quick.

1213
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,700
Not a whole lot.

1214
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,000
Looks like there's about three new games here.

1215
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:50,120
To Love, Roo Trouble, Doki Doki, Rinkai Gakuhen comes out on the PSP, as well as Ikitosan,

1216
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,640
Eloquent Fist comes out, regular and limited edition.

1217
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:59,000
To make a correction to the comment in the chat room that we had, Silent Hill Homecoming

1218
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,040
hasn't been rated or reviewed by IGN yet.

1219
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:11,960
They do have one press rating, which is from, that is a 6.5, that's from the official Xbox

1220
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,960
magazine.

1221
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,560
So, all your hate needs to be directed to the official Xbox magazine at this time.

1222
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,000
IGN, you can hate on it a little bit later.

1223
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,360
Alright, that's it for Japanese release dates.

1224
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,200
Well, how about more news?

1225
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,160
Cause no good news is good good news?

1226
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,160
Okay.

1227
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,160
How about it?

1228
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:40,520
Well, um, Hideo Kojima is the hero of many, many a gamer for giving us the Metal Gear

1229
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,520
franchise.

1230
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:48,760
And he's saying that he's got ideas for Metal Gear Solid 5, 3 concepts, but he doesn't want

1231
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:53,200
anyone to use them because that means he has to get involved and he doesn't wanna.

1232
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:59,200
He said he was gonna be stepping back out of Metal Gear Solid the whole series, but

1233
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:05,440
honestly I think that he should have some involvement with it.

1234
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,080
It was his story from the beginning.

1235
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:11,200
I don't think that starting a story and leaving it in the hands of other people, especially

1236
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:18,040
if you've controlled it so far, you know, it could, well I mean, it could probably have

1237
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:24,400
less of a bizarre ending than Metal Gear Solid 4 had, maybe, but I don't know, I liked his

1238
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,400
weird storytelling.

1239
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,520
Well, I can tell you what one of his ideas were for the new Metal Gear Solid game and

1240
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,440
I'll give you a little bit of a vague idea here.

1241
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:42,080
Basically, a couple of snakes, cronies, you know, will be coming to visit him.

1242
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:48,760
Unfortunately, when they arrive there, they will figure out that he's dead and to which

1243
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,440
they have to convince everyone around him that he's still alive by moving his arms and

1244
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,160
stuff and hanging out on the beach and that kind of fun stuff.

1245
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,160
He's not getting the weekend at Bernie's treatment.

1246
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,480
I thought it was dead or alive.

1247
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,800
The most dorkest thing I've ever heard.

1248
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,320
Okay, here's the thing though, I mean, it's interesting because he might have actually

1249
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,360
really meant it this time when he said he wasn't doing another Metal Gear game, because

1250
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,040
doesn't he always say that, like, I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do it, no, I'm

1251
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,920
not gonna do it, and then he always looks like he does it.

1252
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:24,840
Now he's kind of like, this kind of is like, well, I don't really want to do it, but if,

1253
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,640
you know, they wanted me to do it, I have an idea.

1254
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:34,720
Well, there was some other type of experimental game that he was working on, but, I mean,

1255
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,680
as long as he writes this- What, bulk tie?

1256
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,800
Sorry.

1257
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,960
I think we need a solid snake party game.

1258
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:47,580
Well, he's quoted as saying that he wants to create something new and it's difficult

1259
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:53,280
to explain since no one's seen it before, so he doesn't know if it will sell well.

1260
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,960
But, I mean, there's nothing to say that he can't have some involvement on Metal Gear

1261
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,520
Solid 5, at least as a creative director, you know, instead of being as hands-on as

1262
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:07,640
he was with a lot of the other stuff, right?

1263
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:12,800
Hephaestus in chat says it's like, ooh, please beg me to do it and I'll reluctantly agree.

1264
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,960
It's kind of what this amounts to.

1265
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,960
Nice.

1266
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:20,920
Well, we'll see if he ends up coming back in a larger capacity or if he really means

1267
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,400
it this time.

1268
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,760
I honestly think he really means it, but he's not going to be able to resist contributing

1269
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,280
in some way, but he's just going to probably scale back his involvement.

1270
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,280
We'll see.

1271
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,880
Oh, yeah, the weekend at Bernie's saying that's comedy gold, man.

1272
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,120
It'll be awesome.

1273
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:42,480
Anyways, there's something out there that you can play for free on your PS3.

1274
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,600
That's right.

1275
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:50,420
There is actually an MMO available in Japan called Angel Love Online, and it is a free-to-play

1276
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:57,320
MMO, and there are instructions online to allow you to set up your own account and basically

1277
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:01,520
create your own, I guess, login.

1278
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:07,120
If you don't have a PlayStation Network login for Japanese PlayStation Network, then you

1279
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:13,120
can create one and also help you create a login for this game.

1280
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:17,600
To create your Japanese PlayStation Network login, the easiest way to do that is actually

1281
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:24,040
go to a website called Japanesepsn.com, and they'll walk you through it.

1282
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:31,920
As far as creating your own login for this game, you can actually go to ps3fanboy.com.

1283
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,460
They have an article on there for that, and also neogaf.com, their forums.

1284
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,640
There's another article.

1285
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,320
The game itself actually looks a little bit like Ragnarok Online, kind of, except really

1286
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,200
like chibi with a bunch of people.

1287
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,600
Are you trying to just get Tiara and Jamie interested in this game?

1288
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,480
Not really, but I'm just saying, hey, it's a free-to-play game.

1289
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,540
I don't really know what the point of the game is.

1290
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,600
There is someone riding a giant beetle, so that's kind of cool.

1291
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:04,260
Oh, and there's another giant frog or something, but lots of people dressed up really weird.

1292
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:10,840
Someone's in a giant cat robot thing, so yeah, I'm sure this will appeal to somebody.

1293
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,960
I don't know what the point of this game is or purpose, because it's all in Japanese,

1294
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,840
so ha ha, funny.

1295
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,960
But yeah, check it out, it's free.

1296
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,520
So free is awesome, and if it sucks, hey, you know what, at least this game looks a

1297
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,680
little bit better than yours.

1298
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,680
Is that going to be your new thing?

1299
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,880
Well, at least it's better than yours.

1300
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,520
Yes, it is better than yours.

1301
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,200
Angel of Online.

1302
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,320
Also better than Yaris are price drops, hooray.

1303
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,980
And it was rumored that a big old price drop is coming for the Sony Playstation 3, but it

1304
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:46,560
looks like it's actually mostly kind of contained to Blockbuster.

1305
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,780
It looks like they appear to be unloading some extra consoles there.

1306
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:53,280
This happened on Friday, and it was caught from a memo that was going around internally

1307
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,720
within the company, is that they're dropping the price of the 40 gigabyte machines at Blockbuster

1308
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:03,320
down to $360, which is about a $40 difference from what they were at.

1309
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,120
They're just kind of trying to unload these systems and get them out, since we know there's

1310
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,760
some new SKUs coming, probably from the Tokyo Game Show.

1311
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,920
But just so you know, right now, it looks like it's only contained to Blockbuster, but

1312
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,880
could this be the first little thing that starts a snowball?

1313
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,800
Well, they already have the new SKU out right now, the 80 gigs core system is available

1314
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:26,800
right now, but they are sitting on a lot of the 40 systems, and what are you going to

1315
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,800
do with those?

1316
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:32,080
I mean, they were the same price as the 80s, so now you have to drop the price to get them

1317
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,120
out of there.

1318
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,120
So that kind of sucks, but yeah, and I can imagine the same is going to happen with the

1319
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,360
Metal Gear Solid bundles, if there are any left over, they're going to have to drop the

1320
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:48,160
price of those, because the new 160 is coming out in like November sometime, so yeah.

1321
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,560
And that's not surprising, but yeah, this is not the price drop you're looking for,

1322
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,320
they're not dropping the system down $200 or anything like that, it's just clearing

1323
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,320
them out.

1324
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,680
Right, because you know, with all these games you usually have to install on the systems,

1325
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,340
you probably want to get a bigger hard drive now that we're learning what it's for, and

1326
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,760
that is installing the games on your drive basically.

1327
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:09,960
Which reminds me, I need to get a bigger hard drive for the Xbox, my 20 gig drive is finally

1328
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,560
starting to fill up to the point where I can't fit much more on it, and it's because of freaking

1329
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,560
Rock Band.

1330
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,360
I have been kind of clearing out old games and stuff, and I just, I have a lot of crap

1331
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,360
on there.

1332
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:25,120
You know, keep in mind, 7 of the 20 gigs gets taken up with that emulation stuff.

1333
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,920
So I think I might finally have to cave and get, you know, a bigger drive.

1334
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,200
Let's say, you know, hell freezes over and I want to reinstall Final Fantasy XI on my

1335
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,000
Xbox someday, I just wouldn't be able to do it without a bigger hard drive.

1336
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
We'll see.

1337
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Or get a second hard drive.

1338
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,800
I don't know.

1339
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,360
Can you get a 20 gig hard drive cheap?

1340
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,360
You know, they don't even make them anymore.

1341
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,360
Yeah, they do.

1342
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,360
Might be able to get them used, right?

1343
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,360
They do.

1344
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,360
Really?

1345
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,360
You can get them for like $59.

1346
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,880
That's still a bit of money.

1347
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:54,680
Wait, I mean, because when the 60 gig hard drives come out by themselves, you know, I'm

1348
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,400
sure they're going to drop the price of the 20s.

1349
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,400
True.

1350
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:02,680
They just dropped the price of the 120s by like 20 bucks or so, but it's still expensive.

1351
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:09,200
By the way, I was at Fry's this weekend randomly and I saw HD DVD players for 40 bucks on the

1352
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,200
360.

1353
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,200
Yep.

1354
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,200
How sad.

1355
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,200
And movies from $2.99 and up.

1356
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,200
$2.99 and up for the HD movies.

1357
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,480
They were still too expensive and I didn't want them.

1358
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,480
Yeah.

1359
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:22,000
You know, the $2.99 ones are usually kind of crappy things that aren't even real movies.

1360
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,200
Usually those types of things that just show off the power of HD players like, you know,

1361
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,960
National Geographic, you know, Discover the World and stuff, which, you know, you might

1362
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,640
want to watch once to go ooh and aah, but that's about it, right?

1363
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,640
So.

1364
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,640
Anyway, sorry.

1365
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,640
Tangent.

1366
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,640
My bad.

1367
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,640
Well, what is a show without tangents?

1368
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:45,360
Well, here's some good news for all of our Sonic fans and hopefully it won't be like

1369
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,560
some of the previous ones.

1370
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:55,880
Um, Yuji Naka is, uh, working on, uh, uh, something with a probe, which is the new development

1371
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,880
studio.

1372
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,880
They have a website posted that says that it's a new experience that can be played by

1373
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:06,000
penguins.

1374
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
How do penguins play video games?

1375
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,320
But it'll be something with Sega and I mean, maybe it'll be Sonic.

1376
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,320
Maybe it'll be Outrun.

1377
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,100
I doubt it's Sonic.

1378
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,200
It's gotta be something new.

1379
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,400
It's a game where you make snow cones.

1380
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,400
Pengo!

1381
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,400
Maybe you build igloos.

1382
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,400
That'd be fun.

1383
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:28,840
But the, the site Frostbite2008, I'll link it in the chat room, but it's got this little

1384
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,800
flash thingy with a penguin in front of a screen.

1385
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:39,000
It's actually a propre.sega.jp.

1386
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,720
Just go look.

1387
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,360
Hopefully this means that the game will involve penguins because that'll be cute.

1388
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,360
I love penguins.

1389
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,520
That's what I'm hoping for.

1390
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:53,440
It looks basically like a blurred out TV, like a widescreen TV in the background and

1391
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:59,960
then a penguin in front of it with the exclamation point and a question mark and a word bubble

1392
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:04,120
as looking off to the side and the penguin doesn't look very confused.

1393
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,920
He just looks flappy, but Rob likes penguins.

1394
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,920
I love penguins.

1395
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:10,920
That's what I'm hoping.

1396
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,480
It's a whole new, I hope it is like a new version of Pengo or something.

1397
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,400
It means, it means, it means the next Sega game will be released only on Linux.

1398
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,400
I somehow doubt that.

1399
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,400
I know.

1400
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,760
It'll be written in penguin-ese.

1401
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,320
You cannot understand it.

1402
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,360
You have to, you have to pay for the game in fish.

1403
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:35,120
All right, we'll see in a few more days when they announce it.

1404
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:42,520
Something else that's going to be coming possibly soon would be the new Sonic Genesis collections,

1405
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:50,040
which is supposed to be coming out on the 360 and PS3, according to some retail listings

1406
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:55,400
dug up, and it says, each with ship dates of February 2009.

1407
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,600
Hmm, what could that be?

1408
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,480
Could that actually be coming out?

1409
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,480
I don't know.

1410
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,480
Retail listings.

1411
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:07,000
I wouldn't have seen that either, would I?

1412
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,360
But yeah, so, I don't know, it's probably a collection of all the Sonic games.

1413
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:18,680
It's supposed to be pretty cheap, from what I hear, and I'd imagine it probably just has

1414
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,320
like the Sonic Sega Genesis games.

1415
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,920
Don't we already kind of have the Genesis games on Xbox Live Arcade?

1416
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,280
Yeah, Sonic Mega Collection or something like that, you know.

1417
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,200
Seems a little silly.

1418
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,200
But uh, $29.99.

1419
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,200
Again.

1420
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,400
It's, we've seen this game a million times.

1421
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,760
I'm grabbing like $19.99 or $29.99, so, you know, it'd be like the equivalent of buying

1422
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,200
the Xbox Live Arcade games, probably.

1423
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,200
It might actually be the Xbox Live Arcade games.

1424
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,440
Do we get, I was going to say, do we get the slightly souped up versions?

1425
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,720
I don't know.

1426
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,000
Frisbee echoes my thoughts exactly, a Sega compilation.

1427
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,880
That's called the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox ones.

1428
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,880
It's like we've seen all this before.

1429
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,080
Yeah, but the GameCube and Xbox.

1430
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,080
So now we get achievements, wooo!

1431
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,080
Exactly.

1432
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,080
Wooo!

1433
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,080
Alright.

1434
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,940
Well, you know, Sonic is a classic though, despite the fact that they release it over

1435
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:04,940
and over and over again.

1436
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,200
It still is a classic game.

1437
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:11,040
And we love to pay classic games some tribute here on this program, and that's why every

1438
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,560
week DarkSakura likes to bring us her classic video game of the week.

1439
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:19,900
So DarkSakura, please go into the Dusty Archives of Gaming and find a game that should be highlighted

1440
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:26,080
this week on the program in the Classic Game of the Week segment.

1441
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,600
Today's classic game is Mega Man 2.

1442
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,440
And I'm saying Mega Man 2 instead of the first one because, honestly, I think Mega Man 2

1443
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,280
is a much better game.

1444
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:45,040
So if you want to roll that beautiful bean footage, Rob.

1445
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,200
How many of us remember that noise?

1446
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,400
This is Metal Man's music.

1447
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:55,120
But basically, it's, you know, it's, okay, who in our chair room does not know Mega Man?

1448
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,040
Do I have to really explain it?

1449
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,840
You're a little blue robot, and you go through all these different stages, fighting off these

1450
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,920
cute little robotic enemies, and you pick up power-ups on the way, like a big giant

1451
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,880
Mega Man head.

1452
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:19,080
Also, if you don't know who Mega Man is, he's like Bender from Futurama, totally.

1453
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:23,600
At any rate, as you make it through the level, you have to fight a robot master.

1454
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,480
Ooh, they have whips and chains and never mind.

1455
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:31,400
At any rate, basically you have to fight these different robots that each have a different

1456
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:37,040
ability, and the theme of their stage is, you know, goes along with whatever their ability

1457
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,040
is.

1458
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:45,160
Like Mega Man shoots out metal blades, and Bubble Man shoots out bubbles that don't do

1459
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:50,320
much except for the very end of the game, where there's only three places that you use

1460
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,720
the weapon at all.

1461
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:56,920
Although there are some robots that if you do it in a certain order, some are weaker

1462
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,280
to others.

1463
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:03,600
This music here is Quick Man stage, which is like the single most annoying stage.

1464
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,960
Unless you have fantastic timing, it's almost impossible to get past those beams that shoot

1465
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:08,960
across.

1466
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:09,960
Use Flash Man power.

1467
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,280
That's right, use Flash Man power.

1468
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,440
However Dan can do it without using Flash Man's thing.

1469
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,440
That's insane.

1470
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:19,640
I've seen him do it, I did not believe he could do it until I saw him do it.

1471
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,600
Plus you need that Flash Man power to beat the boss.

1472
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,040
It really helps beating the boss, because you can take like a third of his life away

1473
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,000
instantly if you have all the Flash Man power.

1474
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,760
Yeah, it's like I was saying earlier, each of the enemies in the game have a particular

1475
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:41,360
weakness to the other boss's master's powers, except for Air Man, which you can only really

1476
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:46,480
get him with the regular shot and the metal blades work on him too.

1477
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,800
I think you're supposed to use Leaf Shield if you have it.

1478
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,800
I think.

1479
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,800
I might be wrong.

1480
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,480
I always just started off with Air Man.

1481
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,160
I either started off with Metal Man or Air Man.

1482
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,800
Yeah, I started with Metal Man.

1483
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,560
That person just did it, see.

1484
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,080
You have to have impeccable timing to be able to get past this part though.

1485
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,080
You just have to have it memorized.

1486
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:08,400
We'll have to link that one in the chat room, because I was very- and they even got the

1487
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,400
power up too.

1488
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,400
This is the part that always got me.

1489
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,400
Yeah.

1490
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,800
Oh no, it was- yeah it was this one, sorry.

1491
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:23,440
Anyway, I know this is really great radio, but I uh, this is actually one of my all time

1492
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,440
favorite games.

1493
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,960
It's up there on the list.

1494
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:31,920
I even got so bored one day that I cracked the code by myself just experimenting with

1495
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,920
it.

1496
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,600
The password code where you put in the red blocks and blue box wherever to get past whatever

1497
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,220
and get all of the power ups and everything.

1498
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:43,880
And I wrote it on a pair of torn up blue jeans.

1499
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,680
So I actually had it rolled up like a scroll.

1500
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,160
Scroll and every- scroll.

1501
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:53,080
Like a scroll and everything, it was my special thing to get past that.

1502
01:17:53,080 --> 01:18:00,240
The other cool thing about this one is that they actually had to fight to get this one

1503
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:04,480
out since the first Mega Man didn't have- well Rockman I should say in Japan, didn't

1504
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,520
really have that big of a following.

1505
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:13,960
But since they put more work into the game and improved the graphics and the overall

1506
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,840
play of it, they were able to get this out and since then it's become basically a staple

1507
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,520
of almost anyone's classic collection.

1508
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:27,000
Of course it's spawned so many sequels that we've lost count, including a couple of fighting

1509
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:36,920
games, the Power Battles and a few other- there's even the whole Mega Man EXE series,

1510
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,360
you know, we wouldn't have that without this even though I think we'd be better off without

1511
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:44,080
it because I don't really care for it personally.

1512
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:49,520
It also made GameSpot's greatest games of all time.

1513
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:56,300
It was number 33 in Nintendo Power's top 200 Nintendo games ever list.

1514
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,080
It also had a novelization.

1515
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:04,720
They released a novel of it that- I guess it was only in the US but it was put out by

1516
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,960
Scholastic like every other dance kid's book in the late 80s and early 90s.

1517
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,400
Was that the same guy who did the Blaster Master books and all that stuff?

1518
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,400
It doesn't say.

1519
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,400
Huh.

1520
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,520
It doesn't say.

1521
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,920
It also had like one of the best worst cover arts ever, you know, because it had him holding

1522
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,240
the gun and everything and had the visor, it was so stupid and ugly.

1523
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:33,320
Also there was a Navi mode in the game if you got the Rockman Complete Works discs that

1524
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:39,520
came out on Playstation in 1999 in Japan, which were the NES versions with the tons

1525
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:49,320
of bonuses, but it also had a sort of, I guess a commentary kind of mode for playing through

1526
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,320
the game.

1527
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,240
It was also included in the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.

1528
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:57,880
It was on PS2 and GameCube and Xbox.

1529
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,000
So again, it's one of my favorite games.

1530
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,800
And also this is the game that gave us Rush, remember?

1531
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:09,920
You could get the platform or the jet or the other Rush thing that I forget.

1532
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:10,920
What was it?

1533
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,920
The one that wrote up walls?

1534
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,920
Number three.

1535
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:13,920
Yeah.

1536
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,920
Yeah.

1537
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,880
You could, and it also had the E-Tank, so you could get your full refill system and

1538
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,880
everything.

1539
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:27,800
And this is the one that I think set the stage for the releases afterwards.

1540
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,280
And it's really the one that the Mega Man 9 is even modeled after because you don't

1541
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,080
have the power slide or a lot of that stuff that came even in 3, you don't see that

1542
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,080
in 9.

1543
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,240
I mean, 9 is in some ways a direct sequel to 2, not to 8.

1544
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,480
As far as the way it plays, it does.

1545
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:49,320
But to be technical, there was actually, for 8 and 9, there was a game that came in between.

1546
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:55,240
And I do want to say that it was Mega Man and Bass.

1547
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah, when Mega Man and Bass came out, it was actually under development, it was titled

1548
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,800
Rock 8.5.

1549
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:10,400
So 9 is supposed to be a direct sequel, I mean an actual full sequel to 8 following

1550
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,320
through that whole thing.

1551
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:19,040
But honestly, this is the one I will sit back and go, and for a little while, I can't do

1552
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,440
it now because of course it's been a while since I've played this game regularly, I

1553
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,640
used to be able to do the dragon part blindfolded.

1554
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,160
Because it is the same pattern, if you know the pattern, I mean, I would die sometimes,

1555
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:34,000
but if you know the pattern, then it wasn't really all that hard because it did the same

1556
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
damn thing every time.

1557
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,760
Of course if you don't have all your- That's more impressive than being able to do the

1558
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,280
quick man beams in my opinion.

1559
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,680
And also if you don't know how to do, well if you don't save all your crash blocks to

1560
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:52,760
that one right towards the end, then you're screwed for the whole rest of the game.

1561
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:53,760
Do you know what I mean?

1562
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,400
The one with the wall things that shoot at you.

1563
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,000
And the thing is, I can be completely ambiguous about all the details of this game, and people

1564
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,280
will still know what the hell I'm talking about.

1565
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:07,280
Unless they're like, I guess they're 12 or something.

1566
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:13,880
So that's the game, Mega Man 2, if you haven't played it, damn it, why haven't you?

1567
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,240
And it's on Virtual Console now, right?

1568
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,600
Yes, I know, so they need to get it now.

1569
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,320
Although I would recommend instead of getting it on Virtual Console, just get, even though

1570
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:25,280
I know people at the GameCube version of the Mega Man collection, just get the Mega Man

1571
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,280
collection.

1572
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,480
No, you have to have the Nintendo.

1573
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,920
Alright, there you go, Mega Man 2, your classic game of the week.

1574
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,920
Enjoy.

1575
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,880
Alright, that's gonna bring part A to a close here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1576
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,600
We're gonna take ourselves a break though, we got plenty more when we come back.

1577
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,040
We haven't even begun to talk about some of the rumors going around about the DS.

1578
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,160
And speaking of the Wii, we got plenty more Wii news coming up when we get back, and of

1579
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,640
course the mailbag and your emails.

1580
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:54,280
And plenty more when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio, so stay tuned.

1581
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,200
Whoa, what is going on over there?

1582
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,200
I dropped the microphone.

1583
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:01,400
Jamie's about ready to just run out of here now that it's break time, no I'm kidding.

1584
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:10,320
Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1585
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,240
So you know this is the part of the show where we'd usually play a commercial or something

1586
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,400
like that, but we wanted to give something extra special to those of you guys listening

1587
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,400
tonight.

1588
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:21,480
And plus the fact we haven't gotten a lot of new submissions lately for new PSAs or

1589
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,480
what have you.

1590
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,540
So we're gonna do a giveaway tonight, and this is something extra special for you guys.

1591
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:32,040
We have an Xbox 360 code for Feeding Frenzy 2.

1592
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,760
It's a brand new game that came out from PopCap a couple weeks ago on Xbox Live Marketplace.

1593
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,960
You might know the game Feeding Frenzy is already there on Xbox Live Marketplace.

1594
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,840
And PopCap games are always a good time for some good casual fun, so we'd like you to

1595
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,840
get in on the fun.

1596
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:45,920
We're gonna give away a code.

1597
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:54,920

We'll give that away next week live.

1603
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:19,720
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us at Orange Lounge

1604
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,720
Radio.

1605
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:28,120
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday evening, September the 28th

1606
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:31,240
of 2008, if you can believe it.

1607
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:35,520
October's almost here and then pretty soon it'll be 2009.

1608
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,520
Where does the time go?

1609
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,520
I don't know anymore.

1610
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,520
Alright.

1611
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:43,520
Well, we've talked quite a bit about Fable 2 in the last break and that they're inserting

1612
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,800
something in a little later after the game is released.

1613
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,800
We talked a little bit about 360.

1614
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,720
Now we're going to talk a little bit about the Nintendo DS and Loki's going to start

1615
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,720
us off tonight.

1616
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:56,120
Yes, there's some very interesting rumors coming out about the DS.

1617
01:24:56,120 --> 01:25:03,280
Actually, this is actually coming from a Japanese newspaper and it's also from their website

1618
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,040
as well.

1619
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:11,640
And there may be some revisions coming to the DS very, very soon.

1620
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:19,160
Those revisions would be, of course, an added camera that will be, I guess, integrated into

1621
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:25,040
the handheld itself and also the ability to play music.

1622
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:29,680
And apparently one of the routes that they're going with this is, I guess, it's going to

1623
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,440
support using SD memory cards.

1624
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:38,920
So you'll be able to transfer stuff back and forth from your Wii system to your DS.

1625
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:45,440
You'll be able to load songs, I guess, onto it as well through that.

1626
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:50,240
And the newspaper looks like Nikkei.

1627
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:56,120
They're expecting that the system be priced under 20,000 yen.

1628
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:04,080
And the Nintendo DS Lite currently is priced at 16,800 yen in Japan.

1629
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:09,180
And it looks like the new DS will launch first in Japan with other countries seeing an allocation

1630
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:17,600
of several hundred thousand units before anybody else overseas sees them, so interesting.

1631
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:24,440
And funny because this kind of goes in with the other story that's come out a couple days

1632
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:33,160
ago about how Nintendo will be doing a media event on October 2nd and 3rd.

1633
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:40,040
Hmm, a little interesting that this comes out in a newspaper.

1634
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:45,200
I don't think that they would run rumors.

1635
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:50,400
And what other announcements could we possibly expect from this media event?

1636
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:57,800
Because this is, I think, their opportunity to save face from E3.

1637
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:03,440
My guess, which is interesting, my guess would be of course announcing Disaster Day of Crisis

1638
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,560
since it's already out in Japan, Europe is right around the corner.

1639
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,520
They haven't announced the date for the US yet.

1640
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:15,920
And the other thing I wouldn't be surprised if I saw was that they're publishing Conduit.

1641
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,360
Because if you notice, for a game that doesn't have a publisher, there's sure a lot of screenshots

1642
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:26,040
coming out every single day, and kind of the whole marketing campaign is in full force,

1643
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:30,280
kind of makes you go, hmm, why would they be trying to market this game so strongly

1644
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,840
right now when they don't even have a publisher yet?

1645
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:37,120
Because usually the publisher is the one that does the marketing for them.

1646
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:41,280
Interesting to think about that maybe this game is right around the corner, and maybe

1647
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,640
Nintendo's publishing it.

1648
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:49,280
After all, it was in Nintendo's booth at PAX, so, hmm, might be a guess.

1649
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:54,360
Well hey, before the show, we, you know, and that DS is supposed to be out this year.

1650
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,080
So that could be, you know, that's probably some of the strongest evidence as to why they

1651
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,960
would need a special press conference to announce it.

1652
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:00,960
Yeah.

1653
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,960
It's coming out this year.

1654
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:02,960
Very interesting.

1655
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:03,960
What do you think?

1656
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:06,200
Would you buy a DS for the camera and the music and all this stuff?

1657
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,200
Maybe.

1658
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,200
Maybe?

1659
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,200
Maybe.

1660
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,200
I have to see if it's worth it.

1661
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,200
I expected you to say give me a flat up no.

1662
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,200
I'm kind of surprised.

1663
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:17,200
You know, but see the thing is, what other applications on the homebrew side could use

1664
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,400
this camera and stuff?

1665
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,520
That would be, I'd be more interested to see that.

1666
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,840
And you just want to hack it.

1667
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,840
Yes.

1668
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,840
Alright.

1669
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,840
Darcy, what do you think?

1670
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:25,840
I wouldn't waste my money on it.

1671
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,480
I already have 50 million other things that do all that.

1672
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,480
I've got an iPhone.

1673
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:33,640
I don't need anything else that takes pictures or plays music, so.

1674
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,200
Tiara, any thoughts for you on this?

1675
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:40,360
Well, like I said on Twitter, if it's not broke, don't fix it.

1676
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:44,560
I already have a DS that works, so there's no reason for me to buy another one.

1677
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,120
Speaking of Twitter, let's go over there and look at the answers to tonight's pre-show

1678
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,600
and we do have a Twitter account at OLR, simply our Twitter name, and sometimes we ask some

1679
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,100
questions before the show and read some of our favorite answers on the air.

1680
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:59,200
We asked, would you buy the Nintendo DS again if they re-release it with the camera and

1681
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,320
music playback abilities?

1682
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,300
We had a lot of replies tonight, so I'm going to try to read from people we don't usually

1683
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,680
hear from in the chat room or on Skype.

1684
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:13,200
JohnnyG44 says, no, because almost everyone has a phone that can do both of those things.

1685
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:16,560
I would buy a new DS with onboard memory storage though.

1686
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,720
Crows says, I have a cell phone with two megapixels and an iPod with 30 gigabytes.

1687
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,160
I don't need those features.

1688
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:26,760
It would just make it cost like 300 bucks.

1689
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:31,200
Frisbee says, no, most people have an MP3 player, a digital camera, a camera MP3 phone

1690
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,520
and a DS already.

1691
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,600
Why pay for all three of these all over again?

1692
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,680
Dark Circuitry says, I don't have a DS in the first place, but I'd happily buy one if

1693
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:43,760
it had those extra features, albeit at a lower price than it is now.

1694
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:48,000
Decipher13 says, I'm still packing a fat, a fat, a DS fat.

1695
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,200
I've held off on getting a light so far, but I do collect Nintendo handhelds.

1696
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,200
I may eventually.

1697
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,200
I like that.

1698
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,200
I collect Nintendo handhelds.

1699
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,640
Can you imagine though, if they did have storage, like say gig of storage space on there, how

1700
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,080
bad that would make the Wii look?

1701
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:07,600
It's like you can afford to put a gig of storage on here and yet you can't have any storage

1702
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,600
on the Wii.

1703
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,600
You know, five.

1704
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,600
Very interesting.

1705
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,600
But it has been a couple of years.

1706
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,600
The cost of memory has maybe come down.

1707
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,600
Let me read a couple more here.

1708
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,640
Harry AKA says, no, I don't think I would.

1709
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:19,300
And then just to show the diverse amount of responses we're getting, that's immediately

1710
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:23,000
followed by Durhindermyth says, hell yes.

1711
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,620
I'd rather have a GBA multiplayer compatibility back, but the camera would be flipping awesome.

1712
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,480
So kind of a wide variety of answers on Twitter.

1713
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:33,160
I didn't even read them all, but it's very varied in the yeses and nos there.

1714
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,720
Thanks to everybody that replied on Twitter.

1715
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,120
Sorry to those that didn't get through, but I try to focus on those that usually don't

1716
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,120
join us in chat.

1717
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,960
Very interesting, the diverse amount of responses.

1718
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,240
I think there were enough yeses, though, that this is going to be successful if they release

1719
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,240
it.

1720
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,720
Well, they're not really having trouble selling yeses right now, I think, but I mean, and

1721
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:53,460
they're not really, I don't think the PSP is getting there, you know, close to them

1722
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:54,460
anytime soon.

1723
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:59,960
I think this is obviously the compete against Apple, I mean, because now that they're becoming,

1724
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:07,840
you know, the gaming portable system, I mean, that's hard to swallow, but, you know, maybe

1725
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:11,160
this is the compete with them, because it's cheaper.

1726
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:12,160
Possibly.

1727
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:17,040
It seems kind of a long ways afterwards to, you know, to compete with PSP.

1728
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:21,240
And now that we have camera functionality, I mean, how long will it be before we get,

1729
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,080
like, gimmicky shit to go along with that?

1730
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,080
I mean, I don't know.

1731
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:31,280
Well, all right, well, you know, if they hadn't moved enough copies of the DS Lite, maybe

1732
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:35,600
doing some charitable work would convince more people to get a DS, and that is just

1733
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,600
what is happening.

1734
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:43,040
So, Amazon has actually released a new version of the Nintendo DS, apparently, on their site.

1735
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:46,720
It's what's called the Polar White Console, but one special difference between this and

1736
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:52,000
a normal DS is that it actually has the pink breast cancer awareness ribbon, kind of like

1737
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,900
a universal logo, if you will, right there on the DS itself.

1738
01:31:56,900 --> 01:32:02,720
It's going to be $129.99, which is what any other DS would cost, but Nintendo is donating

1739
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:08,000
$25 from every purchase of one of these Nintendo DSes to a cancer research charity, a very

1740
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,600
commonly heard one in breast cancer awareness circles, Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

1741
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,760
The minimum donation promised is $100,000.

1742
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:17,980
So there you go.

1743
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:21,920
If you want to do a little bit of charity, feel good about your purchase, you know the

1744
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,240
$5 goes to this Breast Cancer Awareness Foundation.

1745
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:28,720
Well, you might want to hold off because, you know, there's a new DS possibly around

1746
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,920
the corner.

1747
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,880
And hey, you know what, if you want to make that contribution, you can go ahead and do

1748
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,880
that on your own.

1749
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:36,240
You don't need another large company to do that for you.

1750
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:40,840
I have to be honest, I actually kind of agree with Loki here, as much as I appreciate what

1751
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:46,120
Nintendo is trying to do here, I don't see myself going out and buying another DS just

1752
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:49,600
for this when I could donate $20 myself.

1753
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,600
You know what I mean?

1754
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,600
Yeah.

1755
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,600
I don't know.

1756
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,180
And here's, I'm going to ask a question I think is out there, but some people might

1757
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:57,700
be too afraid to ask, okay?

1758
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,720
I'm going to put it out there.

1759
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:04,960
Is this Nintendo, is this another way that Nintendo is trying to get women?

1760
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:11,880
I mean, you know, I hate to say it's a marketing ploy, but in a way, look at what they've been

1761
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:16,000
advertising lately, Carrie Underwood, pink DS's.

1762
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,280
Is this a way for them to try and attract women to the Nintendo DS?

1763
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:27,760
I would totally date Nintendo DS if he got a better job and could prove that he's into

1764
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,560
being committed to our relationship.

1765
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,720
But what does him adoring a pink ribbon do for you?

1766
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:38,860
Does it make him that much sexier?

1767
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:39,960
Not really.

1768
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:45,460
If I wanted to donate $5 towards breast cancer, I could just donate $5 instead of going out

1769
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:50,800
and buying a whole new, you know, DS or, you know, I could donate however much I want and

1770
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,740
get that as a tax write-off where it doesn't work that way if you buy the pink DS and let

1771
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:56,760
Nintendo give them $5.

1772
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:03,200
Well, on top of that, with all of these, you know, for example, the runs, the marketing

1773
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:07,920
going in behind this, that's money they're spending on marketing and organizing events

1774
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:15,360
that actually just could go to the research, especially for, you know, as poorly coordinated

1775
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:20,480
as a lot of the research is right now, they should put, you know, the money into instead

1776
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:26,520
of, we're all aware, the awareness is there, you know, I think that the money is better.

1777
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,520
And you can go on-

1778
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:32,300
Applied towards the event, you know, towards not the awareness of, but the treatment thereof.

1779
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:35,600
And if you don't know how to donate, I mean, you can go to their website online.

1780
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,280
It's so simple and pretty much, I mean, there's links that tell you how to donate right there.

1781
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,280
I mean-

1782
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,280
Komen.org.

1783
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,280
K-O-M-E-N.O-R-G.

1784
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,600
Exactly.

1785
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:50,820
And I'm sorry, but this is, it does seem kind of like a cheap attempt to get women to play

1786
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:51,920
their damn console.

1787
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,560
I mean, I hate to say it-

1788
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,560
Oh, I'm helping breast cancer!

1789
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,560
No, you're not.

1790
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,560
No, you're not.

1791
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,600
Think of it, if you really want to make an impact to breast cancer and you don't really

1792
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:05,600
care about this console, donate $129.99 to breast cancer, then there you go.

1793
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:11,040
Well, I think there's a happy medium somewhere, but it's just, you know, or charge a little

1794
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,240
more money for it.

1795
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:14,160
You know, they do that with postage stamps, right?

1796
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:17,280
They charge a little more money for it, but it's that extra money that goes towards the

1797
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,280
research.

1798
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,280
It's kind of like a donation.

1799
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,280
I don't know.

1800
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:23,760
It's just so that they can come out later on and go, look, we donated $100,000 to breast

1801
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:24,760
cancer.

1802
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,640
It's, you know, we're so helpful.

1803
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:28,980
It's all for PR.

1804
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:30,440
It's all to make them look good.

1805
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:35,420
Giove Dea in our chat room says, sorry, but as a girl, I'd probably break a pink DS with

1806
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:38,240
a hammer because it would be fun.

1807
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,920
So sometimes, you know, you don't always get all the women with the pink and all that,

1808
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:48,960
but my question would be, but what do you think of the white DS with the pink ribbon?

1809
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,620
What about, you know, because they always talk about breast cancer and stuff, and they

1810
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:56,500
have really good campaigns for breast cancer and cervical cancer and that kind of stuff,

1811
01:35:56,500 --> 01:36:03,120
but heart disease, just lung cancer, you know, diabetes, stuff like that, you know, that

1812
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,000
kills a lot more people than breast cancer.

1813
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,640
So how about donating to that instead, too?

1814
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,640
All right.

1815
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,240
There's no ribbon for that, unfortunately.

1816
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:15,500
So yeah, certainly some controversial opinions in the community.

1817
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,580
We look forward to hearing yours.

1818
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:17,880
Mailbag at orangeonitrader.com.

1819
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,760
Jamie will read them all live on air.

1820
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,760
All right.

1821
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:26,160
Just, just like, she'll read the next story.

1822
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:31,920
The next story is, Orange Don't Radio host Rob Roberts ended up being found in the garbage

1823
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:36,360
chopped to tiny bits with a I Told You So from co-host.

1824
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,360
That's sad.

1825
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,360
Huh?

1826
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,360
Yeah, only to you.

1827
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:48,720
Anyway, um, for our, uh, our wee friends who are wee little friends who are, uh, not only

1828
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:55,800
virtual console users, but love NEC and Hudson and all the things associated with the PC

1829
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:01,880
engine slash turbo graphics, we are getting super graphics games and I, I have to apologize

1830
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:06,440
to Bobby for what I, uh, a little bit of incorrectness on my comment.

1831
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:13,060
The super graphics actually was the successor to the PC engine, um, especially the PC engine

1832
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:23,760
duo with the arcade card, uh, units as, um, 100%, uh, backwards compatible and had new

1833
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,840
super hue card games that you could play.

1834
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:33,060
Um, and also, uh, these other peripherals that never ended up coming out for it, including

1835
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:38,440
a fully functional, uh, well, a full representation of a flight joystick like they've got for,

1836
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,840
you know, the flight simulators on PC now.

1837
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:45,920
But at any rate, um, super graphics games are going to be coming to virtual console.

1838
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:52,880
The first of them being Dai Makaimura, which, uh, was, uh, Ghouls and Ghosts.

1839
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:58,880
And honestly, the, I've seen the super graphics version of it and it's one of the best ever

1840
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,820
as far as any type of, um, home system port.

1841
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:04,200
So I am personally very excited about that.

1842
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:10,440
Nintendo hasn't announced a US treatment, um, sorry, US release, but there are, um,

1843
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:15,440
many C console imports at the shop channel, so hey, maybe we'll be getting it.

1844
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:16,440
That'll be pretty cool.

1845
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:21,120
But on top of that, other games, you know, that we, we could be looking forward to that

1846
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:28,800
came out on, uh, super graphics in Japan was 1941 Counter-Attack, um, well, really, I think

1847
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,960
that's about all the ones that we are going to know, uh, for sure, except for there was

1848
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:37,400
a rumor that Strider was, um, there was a prototype for it, so we could be getting a

1849
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:41,480
really good version of Strider if they decided to do a release on that, although the last,

1850
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:47,800
uh, PC Engine release of that was, uh, the arcade card version for, uh, PC Engine Duo.

1851
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:51,520
But, um, I'm, I'm really excited.

1852
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:56,280
The super graphics, it, it was, the games were expensive, dude, they were like 110 bucks

1853
01:38:56,280 --> 01:39:04,720
a piece for HuCards and it could have done better if, you know, if it wasn't so expensive.

1854
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:09,480
And how many of these are actually out there?

1855
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,480
Not a lot, right?

1856
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,880
There were seven created.

1857
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:14,880
Two were unreleased.

1858
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,000
One of them, um, No, we're not talking about the games, we're talking about the systems

1859
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
itself.

1860
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
There's not a lot of them.

1861
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Oh, the systems?

1862
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Yeah, there's not a lot of them out there, right?

1863
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,400
Uh, I don't know off the top of my head, but I do know that you can still find them, actually.

1864
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,400
Wow.

1865
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:35,400
Um, in fact, uh, the, uh, the article that we're getting information from, uh, on Joystiq,

1866
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:40,440
so that they got, there's Super Potato and, um, Akihabara for 250 bucks.

1867
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,680
I've seen them before.

1868
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:45,360
You actually, I think you'd have an easier time getting a super graphics than you would

1869
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,000
a Duo LT.

1870
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,240
I'm looking right now on eBay, just curious what people would charge for these, and I

1871
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:57,000
see one, uh, NEC super graphics system with Battle Ace, new, very rare, $89.99, which

1872
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,360
isn't bad, but there's six days left on it, so who knows what that is?

1873
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,360
That's good luck, too.

1874
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:04,600
That auction, I can see that auction going to about 200, 200, 250, like, you know, what

1875
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:11,600
this one was, but then again, you know, you can also buy a, uh, a Duo RX for about, you

1876
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:18,200
know, 175 to 200, so really, I don't think that it's that super rare, just because of

1877
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:22,080
the limited release of the games, just not very well known in that respect, but I think

1878
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,800
that they, I'll find out how many of them they produced.

1879
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,960
All right, well, anyhow, um, regardless, you know, it's gonna bring a whole, you know,

1880
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,920
even though, I guess, not a whole lot of new games, but certainly something that probably

1881
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:38,440
a lot of people never have experienced before, uh, to the market via virtual consoles, so

1882
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,800
that's neat, I suppose.

1883
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,060
I bet you'll be checking out some of these games, DarkSakura.

1884
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:45,060
Will you love them?

1885
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:48,880
Well, I definitely would be, I'm definitely interested in getting Daimakai Mora, although,

1886
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:54,040
honestly, I have the Saturn release, which was the arcade version, um, but it'd be cool,

1887
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:59,280
I mean, to have it on, especially getting that over Super Ghouls N' Ghosts, because honestly,

1888
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:05,360
that game was kind of crap for being in that series, but what was the, Chomakai Mora was

1889
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:13,680
the name for that one, even going by the original name, um, but I'm not, I'm checking it out,

1890
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:17,720
and I don't see exactly how many were made.

1891
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:22,480
Well, they should just release all the games at once, just have a big Super Graphics week,

1892
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,760
although I somehow doubt that'll happen.

1893
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:30,880
But it actually, it seems pretty cool, though, that it, um, used, uh, two independently scrolling,

1894
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,720
uh, background layers as far as its graphics output, sort of like how the Genesis did,

1895
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:38,000
which, you know, was, like, one of the, in fact, they had a problem with some of the

1896
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,200
releases of the games for one system versus the other, because of, uh, if it was a single

1897
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:48,680
or dual layer for the app, it had used, uh, two video chips, it was a pretty advanced

1898
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:52,840
system for its time, it just was pretty darn expensive.

1899
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:58,320
Um, Face Distance Chat asks, why, wait, five games were released for the console, how long

1900
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,000
a life could that have on virtual console?

1901
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,200
Well, it's, I don't know if it's necessarily about trying to milk, you know, the life of,

1902
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:09,400
of the, um, system, but let's face it, Nintendo or, you know, the companies behind it share

1903
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,720
in the profits of, you know, however much they're gonna charge for each one of these

1904
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:17,920
games, let's say $7 for each sale, you know, that's $7 they weren't gonna get before, especially

1905
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:22,840
for a lot of people who have never played these games ever, ever, it's gonna be a bit

1906
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,200
of money in their pocket.

1907
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:28,520
Well, one thing, one thing, though, that also I, I, I think the reason why they're going

1908
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:32,520
ahead and putting the Super Graphics games out is because basically a Super Graphics

1909
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:39,560
really is just a, a souped up PC Engine, and if virtual console can emulate, um, PC Engine

1910
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:43,920
games with no problem, especially to the CD games, there's absolutely no reason why it

1911
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,560
can't, um, emulate the Super Graphics as well.

1912
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:52,160
I mean, the, the audio output was exactly the same as the PC Engine, it was the same

1913
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,160
thing.

1914
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:54,160
Alright.

1915
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,160
So.

1916
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:59,280
You should look at that, uh, eBay link that Act F just posted, you might like that.

1917
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,280
Yeah.

1918
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:01,280
Alright.

1919
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,240
Anyhow, uh, let's, let's move on, uh, more news.

1920
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:06,320
We've spent an awful lot of time talking about a years old system, but that's alright, it's

1921
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:07,320
part of gaming history.

1922
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:10,680
Well, hey, didn't we talk about the, the Master System a few weeks ago?

1923
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:13,800
I know, I know, well, who knows, next week we'll dedicate it to the Pippin.

1924
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:14,800
Eh.

1925
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:21,280
I don't know about that, but, um, there's news coming out of Famitsu Magazine saying

1926
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:27,760
that Level 5 is going to be teaming up with Studio Ghibli on, um, a brand new DS project

1927
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:34,280
entitled, uh, Ni No Kuni The Another World, and of course, um, the studio that brought

1928
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:41,120
you Totoro and the plethora of other awesome animated films will be doing the animation

1929
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:43,360
for that title as well.

1930
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:49,200
And, um, to make the game unique, it will come with a Magic Master Book, I guess that

1931
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:53,440
will be shared by the main character of the game, and which needs to be referred to while

1932
01:43:53,440 --> 01:44:01,040
playing the game, and, um, also they will be making a console version at some point.

1933
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,360
So that's kinda cool.

1934
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:07,760
Um, nice to see some pretty, you know, solid animated games coming to the DS.

1935
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,360
Have we had a new Studio Ghibli movie in a while?

1936
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,360
We haven't seen one in a while.

1937
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:16,040
There's, uh, I thought there was a new one coming, but I thought there was one that was

1938
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:18,640
like coming out this year or something, I just haven't heard much of it.

1939
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:20,840
Maybe it already came out in Japan and it's not out here yet.

1940
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,840
I don't know.

1941
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,400
Ever since I got out of the movie department and, you know, I haven't really been paying

1942
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:30,680
attention to what new movies are coming out from that studio, so, uh, yeah.

1943
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,680
I thought I heard one coming out.

1944
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:32,680
But all of them are gold.

1945
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:33,680
I mean, seriously.

1946
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:34,680
Yeah.

1947
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,680
They're good movies.

1948
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:38,240
So I'm very curious to see what kind of game comes out of this, because it could either

1949
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:42,000
be really good or just one of those things that looks good on paper.

1950
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,240
Well, Level 5 is not stopping there with that partnership.

1951
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:48,620
They are also going to be making some new games for the PSP.

1952
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:51,640
They don't really have anything to do with the Studio Ghibli project.

1953
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:55,160
However, they are doing some other games on the PSP.

1954
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:58,160
One of them is called Ushiro.

1955
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:02,100
It's kind of a scary RPG, if you want to say, for the PSP.

1956
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:05,400
You will actually kind of play as a shin-gami.

1957
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:11,240
It's a god of death in Japanese lore, and you will fight monsters and also grant people's

1958
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:12,320
wishes.

1959
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,080
That's what the part of the game is.

1960
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,200
So there you go.

1961
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:20,720
There's another game called Dambol Senki, or Dambol Senki is also coming out, Cardboard

1962
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:21,880
War Machine.

1963
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,640
It's another RPG where you actually kind of build a robot and you battle against other

1964
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:27,760
robots that you encounter.

1965
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:31,600
Not a lot else known about that game, but some RPG projects for the PSP coming from

1966
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:37,440
Level 5, which will certainly be of interest to PSP fans, because, you know, we don't often

1967
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:41,360
hear about really, really big games on the PSP for a while now.

1968
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:44,640
I mean, these games won't be coming out soon, but it's nice, especially with the PSP fans,

1969
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,000
to know that these are coming out.

1970
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,280
By the way, I don't think it made the show world tonight, but did anybody read on one

1971
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:52,120
of the blogs this week something about, like, there was something where Sony was saying

1972
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,280
they don't want ports anymore on the PSP?

1973
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,280
They don't...

1974
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,280
Yeah, they should talk.

1975
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:59,280
I know, it's just kind of interesting, but...

1976
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,280
No more ports on the PSP!

1977
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:04,960
Well, they actually kind of port it in reverse a lot of times.

1978
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,560
They port PSP games to PS2.

1979
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,080
Well, I kind of thought that was interesting.

1980
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:11,640
They don't want ports on the PSP, I think, of, you know, probably other...

1981
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:15,080
But I'm thinking, like, well, they still got some big sellers, like, Puzzle Quest would

1982
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,900
be a port that's a big sell, right?

1983
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:17,900
Why would you want to say no to that?

1984
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:21,000
Well, I think they were looking for games that are developed specifically for the PSP.

1985
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,640
They don't want, like, because a lot of the games that come out, the PSP version isn't

1986
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:29,760
exactly that strong, and so it's making the console look kind of weak.

1987
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,520
But I think they need, I don't know, it's like a double-edged sword there.

1988
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:37,360
They need more units to be sold, so more publishers get interested in it.

1989
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:41,800
But they need more publishers that are interested in it, so they can get more units sold.

1990
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,320
Before Dr. Salker gets to the next story, I got the answer to the question I was looking

1991
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,320
for.

1992
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:51,120
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea just came out from Studio Ghibli.

1993
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:54,400
And I thought I heard something about that that was the name of the new movie.

1994
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,440
But it's, correct me if I'm wrong, it's only out in Japan, right?

1995
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:59,840
It hasn't come out here because Disney has to do their thing with the translation and

1996
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,840
all that.

1997
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:04,120
So we probably won't see it till early next year, probably.

1998
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:05,120
So.

1999
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:09,440
Alright, we can move on with gaming news, right, Dr. Salker?

2000
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,440
That we can.

2001
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:15,640
Well, there is some news about, for City of Heroes, I know that there are plenty of people

2002
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:24,520
who still play that, that the mission editor is actually going to be delayed, so now issue

2003
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:29,600
13 is to be retitled power and responsibility.

2004
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:35,560
It has everything else that was supposed to come out with the architect mode and an extension

2005
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:43,440
for the sidekick buddy system that's a leveling pact, so basically it lets you and your friends

2006
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:47,680
synchronize your experience so that you're always at the same level.

2007
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:53,720
And even if one person plays more than the other, so you can play together more on an

2008
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:54,720
even keel.

2009
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,720
That's kind of cool.

2010
01:47:55,720 --> 01:48:01,800
Also, there's multi-builds, so you can keep two different versions of the same character.

2011
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:06,920
There's also day jobs, power sets, and merit rewards will be included as well.

2012
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:11,200
And they say that the architect mission editor will be coming out later.

2013
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:18,640
But also, part of the thing in it is supposed to let you create your own NPCs for those

2014
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:21,360
missions, so that's pretty cool.

2015
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,640
Very cool.

2016
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:30,920
Well, one Marvel superhero has had a couple, I don't know, tie-ins with the comic that

2017
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:32,960
weren't exactly great.

2018
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:42,040
Some of the last couple movies actually have been kind of from horrible to not awesome.

2019
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:48,120
But yes, Punisher will be getting not only a new movie this year, but a new game thanks

2020
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:50,280
to the PlayStation Network.

2021
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:56,880
Punisher No Mercy is exclusive to the PlayStation Network and will be coming to us from Zen

2022
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:05,120
Studios, who unfortunately don't have much of a resume, but Rocky and Bullwinkle, the

2023
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:10,280
Xbox Live Arcade game and the new Mushroom Man game, which is kind of, eh, alright.

2024
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:14,960
But who knows, maybe this is the diamond in the rough.

2025
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:21,840
It will be powered by the Unreal 3 engine, and of course we'll follow Frank Castle as

2026
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,440
he seeks revenge.

2027
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:28,640
And they've got some screenshots out for the game so far, it actually looks pretty good.

2028
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:38,640
No word on how it's going to play, but apparently also, I guess, I don't know.

2029
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:41,040
It's no word on when exactly it's going to be released.

2030
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,520
I would imagine maybe around the time of the film.

2031
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:50,360
Oh, that's what it says, aiming to release the game in line with the new Punisher film.

2032
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:55,400
And it will include both single and multiplayer modes as well, character customizations and

2033
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:56,400
trophies.

2034
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:03,040
Alright, well, hopefully we'll see more about this game developing in the next few months.

2035
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,040
And hopefully there'll be a demo, because...

2036
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,360
Demos are a good way to try games.

2037
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,440
Yes, exactly, especially if they're questionable on their quality.

2038
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:11,440
Alright.

2039
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:16,280
Hey, some folks in chat disagree with our assessment of the Rocky and Bullwinkle arcade

2040
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:17,280
game.

2041
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,280
Act Def says, Rocky and Bullwinkle is awesome.

2042
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:20,160
I agree, the cartoon is awesome.

2043
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:24,400
SonicM88 says, why did everyone hate Rocky and Bullwinkle?

2044
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:28,720
It just, I don't know, the fun factor was kind of missing from that game, especially

2045
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:32,640
for something so nostalgic, the game just kind of felt cheap to me.

2046
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:36,520
I don't know, it's really hard to put my finger on it, but it just kind of felt like it just

2047
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,920
got, like, it wasn't any fun.

2048
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:43,640
The minigames were kind of like, they might make you smile for a second, but then you're

2049
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:45,200
like, eh, I can't see myself playing this.

2050
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,200
It would have been a better game on the Wii.

2051
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,280
You think?

2052
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:49,520
With the motion control and everything?

2053
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,520
Maybe.

2054
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,520
Maybe.

2055
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:54,860
I mean, it's just, the Wii seems to be the party game machine, but at the same time it's

2056
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:56,560
getting over killed with that stuff.

2057
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,160
That genre is way too much on there.

2058
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:05,040
It's like if you want to call, you know, the Xbox 360 a first person shooter console, then

2059
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,960
the Wii is definitely the party game console.

2060
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:13,600
Alright, moving on, and this is going to, you know, our long time fans, you know, because

2061
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:17,440
I think we mention this quite often, we had started originally way back on episode one

2062
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:22,400
as a show really revolving around music based video games, and especially DDR was a big

2063
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:26,080
focus of this game, of that era, of Orange Launch Radio.

2064
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,120
So I'm sure a lot of our listeners who remember that, you know, still follow what goes on

2065
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:33,440
in the DDR world, are going to find this news very interesting, because it isn't about DDR,

2066
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:37,280
but a possible new competitor to DDR, question mark.

2067
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:42,020
Not a lot is known about it, but we do know that a patent has been filed with the official

2068
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:48,900
US Patent and Trademark Office by Activision for a game called Dance Hero.

2069
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:53,560
Just like Guitar Hero, so on and so on, now we are going to, and DJ Hero, which we know

2070
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:56,600
is already kind of in the works, Dance Hero.

2071
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:01,380
It's going to be an interactive video game program and video game controllers.

2072
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:06,680
But before you just jump in straight in your mind to rip off, you know, you got to think,

2073
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:11,120
well, you know, even if Guitar Hero was certainly inspired by Guitar Freaks, they changed a

2074
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:12,200
heck of a lot about it.

2075
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:16,080
I mean, the look and feel is not really the same, and certainly in the song list and the

2076
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,760
way it plays out, it's much different.

2077
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:24,300
I for one, I'm very curious to see how they kind of go to Dance Hero.

2078
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:30,060
I've said this for a long time back in the old, you know, DDR centric episodes of Orange

2079
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:35,840
Lounge Radio is that Konami really badly needed to scrap their engine completely and rebuild

2080
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,200
the game from the ground up.

2081
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:41,200
And in a way, I think that's exactly what's going to happen here with what Activision

2082
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:44,800
is doing is that they're going to take a dance game concept and rebuild it from the ground

2083
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,800
up.

2084
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,080
So that could be very interesting.

2085
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:53,820
And I'm not ready to scream theft just yet, because I have a feeling this could be something

2086
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:54,820
kind of new and innovative.

2087
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:55,820
You know what I mean?

2088
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:56,820
I don't know.

2089
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:58,280
What do you guys think?

2090
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:07,600
New and innovative, from a company who ripped off Guitar Freak's Drummania and made it better,

2091
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:08,600
might make it better.

2092
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:09,600
Might make it better.

2093
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,000
To be honest, I don't think they're really going to change.

2094
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:16,040
It's probably going to look like a Guitar Hero type of game, but instead of maybe, you

2095
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:19,840
know, notes scrolling down the screen, it's going to be arrows or steps or feet or something,

2096
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,160
I don't know, to that effect.

2097
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:26,600
But I know, I hear you.

2098
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,560
They're whoring the brand to death.

2099
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,560
Seriously.

2100
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:30,560
Right, right.

2101
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,480
You know, and I see all those concerns, but at the same time, I kind of feel like, oh,

2102
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:37,320
somebody might be finally reinventing the approach to the dance game, because let's

2103
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:44,440
face it, every other dance game that's come out, In the Groove, the, what am I thinking

2104
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:45,440
of?

2105
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:49,360
The freaking game that you can use your own CDs on that was terrible on the PS2.

2106
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,840
What the hell was that game?

2107
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:51,840
Dance Factory.

2108
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,200
Factory or whatever, yeah, Dance Factory or whatever.

2109
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,300
They've all pretty much been the same damn thing.

2110
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,480
It's four arrows that you stomp to.

2111
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,880
Well, maybe this could be something different.

2112
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:04,920
Well, if we're going to go the Activision route, then it's going to have 80 billion

2113
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:07,240
arrows and it's going to be fucking hard.

2114
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:12,520
Now, I'm sorry, I just, it just seems like that they're really going, hey, these games

2115
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,480
actually sell, you know?

2116
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:15,880
Let's make a ton of them.

2117
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:19,720
And, you know, I have no problem with them doing like DJ Hero, and if it's good, great,

2118
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,640
then maybe I'll anticipate this game.

2119
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:24,640
But I have a feeling it's not going to be that innovative.

2120
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:27,920
DJ Hero sounds nothing like Beatmania.

2121
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:33,400
That sounds like Guitar Hero, but exchange the guitar for a DJ turntable.

2122
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:38,240
I mean, seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if you could use the DJ turntable in Guitar

2123
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,640
Hero because it probably is just another controller.

2124
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:46,120
Instead of the strum bar, it's scratching, and instead of the fret buttons, it's keys.

2125
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:47,120
Oh my God!

2126
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:51,360
So much innovation, it blows my mind!

2127
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:54,160
Will I be able to get star power too by shaking the turntable?

2128
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:58,040
Oh, well, maybe I'll have a crossfader for that, you know?

2129
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:00,520
God, I'm sorry.

2130
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,520
I'm not interested.

2131
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:02,520
What are they going to do?

2132
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:03,520
I bet you, you know what?

2133
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:07,320
They're going to, they're going to be able, they're, you know why?

2134
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:11,040
Because they have Guitar Hero behind them, and they have these games behind them, they're

2135
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:15,500
going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted for DDR, and they're not going

2136
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:18,000
to have to fill up a song list with originals.

2137
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,320
Granted, we as DDR fans have come to know and love those Konami originals, but it's part

2138
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,680
of the reason why the game didn't sell us well over here.

2139
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:27,820
You know, they're having to rely on a lot of Japan-centric songs.

2140
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:31,480
They're going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted in DDR.

2141
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:32,480
And they know it.

2142
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:36,400
But half the fun was the songs that were created by the company themselves and their own in-house

2143
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:37,880
artists.

2144
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:41,440
They don't have any in-house artists, okay?

2145
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,440
They have...

2146
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,440
That we know of.

2147
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,540
They could be partnering up with something.

2148
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:48,800
I'm sorry, but even the best song list in the world is not going to make this game any

2149
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:49,800
good.

2150
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:52,880
It's not going to have magic shoes you've got to buy, because you know this game's going

2151
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,480
to have a damn peripheral attached to it, because how the hell are they going to be

2152
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:56,480
original?

2153
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:57,480
Magic shoes might be kind of fun.

2154
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:04,760
Okay, I have one absolute, one word that completely is an utter rebuttal to everything that Loki

2155
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:07,120
is saying.

2156
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:09,200
Speculation.

2157
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:10,200
It is.

2158
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:11,200
It's all speculation.

2159
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:12,200
You don't...

2160
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:13,200
Track record.

2161
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,200
They hoard this thing.

2162
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,960
I swear to God, they hoard this thing so bad.

2163
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:22,760
You watch next year when Guitar Hero has, oh, four to six game releases, and people

2164
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:24,440
are going, my God.

2165
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:29,240
I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero...

2166
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:30,240
Five cents.

2167
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,240
I would...

2168
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,240
No, more than that.

2169
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:35,560
I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero will sell more copies in the Beat

2170
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:36,560
Mania video in this country.

2171
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:37,560
Fifty cents.

2172
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:38,960
Yeah, I can guarantee that will happen.

2173
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:43,840
And I don't know if I can make the same thing for Dance Hero, because it has done very,

2174
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:44,840
very well in places too.

2175
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:46,280
But DJ Hero will sell by its name alone.

2176
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:49,680
It could be the worst game ever, but people go, oh my God, I want to be a DJ.

2177
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:51,560
But what if it's not bad?

2178
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:53,960
I'm not saying DJ Hero will be bad.

2179
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,840
I'm saying Dance Hero will be bad.

2180
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,000
What if it's not?

2181
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,240
It's gonna suck.

2182
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,240
It's gonna suck.

2183
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:00,240
All right.

2184
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:01,240
Big time.

2185
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:07,560
If it sells more than, okay, how many copies of Guitar Hero, the first Guitar Hero sold?

2186
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:08,560
Oh, I don't know.

2187
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,800
When, during its first month of release?

2188
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,360
Not enough until it went on 360.

2189
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:16,360
I don't think.

2190
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:19,920
Well, plus they had to get the first game out there to license the songs everybody wanted

2191
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:20,920
to play.

2192
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:21,920
It doesn't matter anyways.

2193
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:22,920
Because this game will never...

2194
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:30,440
So if it, say that it sells more in its first month than Guitar Hero did.

2195
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:33,400
Dance Hero will not sell more than Guitar Hero did in its first month.

2196
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:34,400
Do you bet your...

2197
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:35,400
Oh.

2198
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:36,400
Oh.

2199
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:37,400
Oh.

2200
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:38,400
Oh.

2201
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,400
No.

2202
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:40,400
I disagree, sir.

2203
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:41,400
I think there's a bet forming here.

2204
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:42,400
No, there is not a bet forming here.

2205
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,120
The only bet is the Eye of Judgment, okay?

2206
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:48,000
This is just a registered trademark, we don't know what this is at all, and we don't even

2207
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
know if it will come out.

2208
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
So why are you thinking that it's gonna...

2209
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Well, okay, so...

2210
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,560
Because I saw the Eye of Judgment, I'm like, wow, that is a piece of shit.

2211
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:56,800
I mean, I even said, what is the point of this game?

2212
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,460
But you haven't seen Dance Hero.

2213
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:00,560
You don't know anything about it other than a name.

2214
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:01,560
I know.

2215
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,840
I don't know anything about it except for the name, but I know the track record of what

2216
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:07,560
they're doing with Guitar Hero, and how they're looking at...

2217
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,560
Guitar Hero was good.

2218
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:09,560
All right.

2219
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:13,040
Yeah, Guitar Hero was good, but see, the problem is they're looking at what Konami has done

2220
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:16,120
with their games and just kind of trying to mimic it.

2221
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:17,840
But that doesn't mean it's not gonna be good.

2222
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:22,080
Yeah, we can go ahead and take the devil's advocate thing, but the fact of the matter

2223
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:26,360
is they need a peripheral with every one of these fucking hero games, so what is the magic

2224
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:29,760
peripheral that's gonna come along with this, and really, is it gonna innovate anything

2225
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,720
other than having a better song list?

2226
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,720
Eye Toy.

2227
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:38,040
It'll use the Eye Toy, and you can wave your hands around and wiggle your butt.

2228
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,840
To be honest, this game will not probably hit until like 2010 anyways, so what do I

2229
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,840
even care?

2230
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:45,640
We haven't had a good argument here on OLR in a long time.

2231
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,640
This is nice.

2232
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:51,520
But I will fucking say I told you so when this game comes out and it's a piece of shit.

2233
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,200
I will rub it in your face like dirty feces.

2234
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:56,920
You know what, though?

2235
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:57,920
Everything's a matter of...

2236
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,280
Track record is two words, speculation is one word.

2237
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:03,800
You were supposed to sum it up in one word, therefore you are disqualified, and your opinion

2238
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:05,200
is thrown out.

2239
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,000
I make my own damn rules.

2240
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,080
That's okay, because we're entitled to make our own rules and change them at will.

2241
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:18,560
You lose, a man will never win an argument with a woman, because we are awesome and men

2242
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:19,560
aren't.

2243
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:20,560
Sorry.

2244
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:21,560
Wow.

2245
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:22,560
You should know that.

2246
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:23,560
You're married.

2247
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:24,560
Yeah.

2248
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:29,120
Nellie, if you're listening, come up here and lay down the law.

2249
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,120
All right.

2250
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:31,120
Wow.

2251
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:32,120
All right.

2252
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:33,120
You know what?

2253
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,120
You know what?

2254
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:35,120
Lots of good...

2255
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:36,120
You know what?

2256
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:38,960
Whether you agree with Loki or not, you know, lots of good points being brought up around

2257
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,520
the board, and I'm sure we're gonna have some calls on it later as well.

2258
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:45,840
Well, I mean, no offense to the answer, but I think the logical step for them would be

2259
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,520
to do like a keyboard hero, because that's at least something you can add.

2260
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,080
Because we haven't had keyboard mania.

2261
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:53,280
Well, we haven't had DDR either.

2262
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:54,280
Seriously?

2263
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:59,000
Fuck Konami with a big chainsaw for disbanding that series, because keyboard mania I was

2264
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
actually pretty good at, and it pisses me off.

2265
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,800
Who is in charge of the DDR series now?

2266
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,760
Is it like on autopilot or something?

2267
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:06,360
Because I mean, what is seriously happening?

2268
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:07,360
I don't know.

2269
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:10,440
But okay, besides all that, I really do think that they should bring like a keyboard thing

2270
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:15,640
up, because then that way you can add it to, you know, Guitar Hero World Tour or whatever,

2271
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:16,920
and you can have keyboards with a lot of stuff.

2272
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,880
Who doesn't want to play Van Halen's jump with a keyboard mania?

2273
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:21,160
We need Sax Maniacs.

2274
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:22,160
All right.

2275
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:26,440
All right, now this is gonna lead to Bagpipe Hero and Didgeridoo Hero.

2276
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:27,440
All right.

2277
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:28,440
It's our hero.

2278
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:30,800
Let's move on.

2279
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:31,800
We've got...

2280
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:32,800
Oh, they made a sitar hero, remember?

2281
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,800
Yeah, online.

2282
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:35,400
That was for the guru of love.

2283
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:40,240
All right, we're gonna move on to the email bag, because I'm sure this whole subject's

2284
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:45,000
gonna get brought up again during the phone calls, so we'll come back round two later

2285
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
on.

2286
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
But for now, round one is over.

2287
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,320
All right, let's go to the mail bag.

2288
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:55,400
Every week, you guys email us at mailbagatorangelaundry.com, and DarkSakura dives in the mail bag and reads

2289
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:58,920
a few of her favorites after she drinks some soda.

2290
02:00:58,920 --> 02:00:59,920
Well, the music's playing.

2291
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:00,920
What are we gonna do?

2292
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:01,920
Just sit here and wait?

2293
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:03,920
Well, we can stare at the ants.

2294
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,800
Is there more ants now?

2295
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:08,120
Yeah, but they're attacking something on the floor, and I don't really know what.

2296
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:10,000
I saw like a trail of them.

2297
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
They're running over there.

2298
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I'm off to get the raid.

2299
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,960
Oh, I can't, because I don't smell like raid in here.

2300
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:14,960
God damn it.

2301
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:15,960
They're just like...

2302
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:16,960
Okay.

2303
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:17,960
How about a fire?

2304
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:18,960
Email time.

2305
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:19,960
Let's set fire to the...

2306
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:20,960
Let's set fire to the floor and burn all the ants.

2307
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:23,720
Did you ever watch that YouTube video of the guy burning the hornet's nest on his child's

2308
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:24,720
swing set?

2309
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:25,720
Oh my gosh.

2310
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:28,600
Setting it on fire with as many different flammable things as he could find?

2311
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:29,600
I was like, stupid?

2312
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:32,600
I don't know, but I think I'll be looking that up right now.

2313
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:33,600
Okay.

2314
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:34,600
Setting fire to swing set.

2315
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:36,720
Look up fucking moron and you'll find him.

2316
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,560
Well, that could be a ton of videos on there.

2317
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,120
I got to look fire swing set.

2318
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:41,120
Okay.

2319
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:43,520
I think it's fire and hornets, but anyway.

2320
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:47,960
First email comes from Hunter Red, aka Redertainment.

2321
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:50,240
Hey y'all.

2322
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:53,600
You know, I can't say y'all without saying it in accent.

2323
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:54,600
Y'all.

2324
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:59,720
As you know, the season where the masses choose which douchebag will represent them is upon

2325
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:01,760
us and I have the question to that end.

2326
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:07,320
I'm going to send an email to all the douchebags running for Congress in my district and I

2327
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:12,200
want to ask them how they feel about video games and the legislation that is currently

2328
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,800
pending about them.

2329
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:17,000
Is there a way I should phrase my email so that I can get a response from them other

2330
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,320
than not calling them douchebags?

2331
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:21,960
That's going to smell, man.

2332
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:25,000
I would have done it, but it'll smell.

2333
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Point point.

2334
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,200
I know that because illustrated quite well.

2335
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:35,840
By the way, Sky, that means you, mister, I've left the studio to try to set fire to the

2336
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:36,840
ants.

2337
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:37,840
I've left the studio to fire.

2338
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:42,480
By the way, Sky, if you hate the influence of the Mormon Church in politics in California,

2339
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,680
you should come to Utah.

2340
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:45,680
They're everywhere and are everything.

2341
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:51,600
No, I've heard about Utah and it's, you know, it's just, you know, you guys, if you listen

2342
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:55,160
to the show last week, you already know how I feel about Proposition 8 and how it's, you

2343
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:59,360
know, setting civil rights back about 50 years, but you know, what can you do?

2344
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:03,760
Honestly, if you want to see the influence of the Mormon Church, just go talk to a boy,

2345
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:07,440
you know, boy scout troop.

2346
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,440
Thanks love the show.

2347
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:12,000
You do what I ask for any podcasts I listen to at work to do, inform, entertain and make

2348
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
me laugh.

2349
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,400
Thanks again, Hunter Red, aka Redertainment.

2350
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,480
You're welcome.

2351
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:19,480
Next one.

2352
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:20,480
Yes.

2353
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:25,920
Hey guys, Dan Shadow here with your helpful hints for Warhammer Online.

2354
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:30,640
There are thousands of Tome unlocks and hundreds of titles you can earn.

2355
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:34,560
I'm going to help you get some of the nicer title unlocks.

2356
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:37,480
First take off all your clothes.

2357
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:41,360
Second use a hundred abilities to be known as the show off.

2358
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:45,260
Third talk to a hundred citizens while naked to be a flirt.

2359
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:49,400
If you target another naked player a hundred times, you'll become the ogler.

2360
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:53,240
If you want to get a nice title that doesn't involve nudity, then jump off a cliff and

2361
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,240
die.

2362
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:59,240
If you do this 25 times, you can have the word floating above your head.

2363
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:00,920
That's all the helpful hints for this week.

2364
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:04,800
I just got into the little big planet beta, so I'll let you guys know how that one goes

2365
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:05,800
when I can.

2366
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,800
See ya.

2367
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:10,160
I want to be in the little big planet beta so that I don't even have a PS3.

2368
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:12,360
I just want a key to say I'm in it and you're not.

2369
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:15,920
I want to be in a game and have ahhhh floating over my head.

2370
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,240
Or remember there was an impossible mission.

2371
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:20,600
You've been listening to Orange Lounge.

2372
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:23,880
No, OLR's not over, sorry.

2373
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:24,880
And the show's canceled.

2374
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:26,920
Good night, everyone.

2375
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,640
Next email.

2376
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:33,120
My question for OLR this week is, do you guys have a backlog of video games to play slash

2377
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:34,720
finish and how large is the backlog?

2378
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:36,920
Oh shit, you really want me to answer that?

2379
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:41,000
Personally I have a backlog on PS2 and even on the Xbox 360, which I only purchased a

2380
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
couple months ago.

2381
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,800
The majority are some RPGs and some action games.

2382
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:48,760
I feel that DDR and World of Warcraft sometimes eat up a lot of my free time, but I'm not

2383
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:51,220
sure what stops me from finishing some games.

2384
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:56,240
As promised, Triple A'd an old school DDR song, Burnin' the Floor, in honor of OLR and 300th

2385
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:57,240
Show.

2386
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:00,120
You actually sent a picture of it, too.

2387
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:03,160
This email is brought to you by Dark Sakura School of Dancing Ferrets.

2388
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:05,960
Peace out and Triple A'd, Jammer Jones.

2389
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:11,760
Off the top of my head, Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, Final Fantasy XII, they're all games

2390
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:12,760
I need to finish.

2391
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:14,240
Kingdom Hearts 2, shit, I never finished that one.

2392
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:15,720
I got really far and I didn't finish it.

2393
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:17,000
There's tons of games I need to finish.

2394
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I have a gaming ADD.

2395
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,080
I've said it a million times on this show.

2396
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,080
Especially this time of year.

2397
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:23,080
That's a huge ass freaking picture.

2398
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:26,400
How can you play just one game this time of year?

2399
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:30,040
It seems like every week leading up to Christmas, there's a new freaking game coming out that

2400
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:31,040
I have to play.

2401
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:34,960
Like Fable 2 is coming out soon, and I barely have touched Warhammer or Spore, even.

2402
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,200
I think I've sunk maybe five hours into Spore, tops, and already there's new games coming

2403
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,520
out I want.

2404
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:42,800
That's just the way it goes, isn't it?

2405
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:55,440
But he sent us quite the massive image of his Triple A, but it is there with 309 perfect

2406
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:57,680
steps and a perfect score.

2407
02:05:57,680 --> 02:05:59,680
Well done to you.

2408
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,320
Here's the big one.

2409
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:02,320
Strong Bad.

2410
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:03,320
The episodic Strong Bad's games.

2411
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:06,400
I freaking know people that have worked on those games and I keep saying I'm going to

2412
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:08,480
support them and I want to play the games.

2413
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:12,200
I haven't even touched them yet, just because there's been so much else that have been grabbing

2414
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:13,200
my attention.

2415
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,720
But I really do want to play the Strong Bad games at some point.

2416
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:19,840
My present backlog is I actually do want to go back and finish Kingdom Hearts 2.

2417
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:23,280
And I actually never finished Final Fantasy X because I got so pissed off that I'd rushed

2418
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:29,040
through leveling the game that I got to one of the battles with what's his stupid face

2419
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,120
with his ugly blue hair.

2420
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:34,400
And I got to the Glyph Mine battle, passed that, and none of my characters were high

2421
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:38,040
enough to stand one hit, so that's my own bad.

2422
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:44,560
And I still have to finish Kingdom Hearts 2, but I glitched the game, like in a major

2423
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:45,560
way.

2424
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:46,560
Nice.

2425
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:51,100
I skipped some level and now I can't get into doing the Pride Lands.

2426
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:53,360
So it's pretty stupid.

2427
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:58,120
I think I did like Halloween Town twice in a row or something, but right now I still

2428
02:06:58,120 --> 02:07:03,200
have to get started on The World Ends With You, which I finally have, I'm so happy.

2429
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:08,820
And I'm also playing through Final Fantasy VI and I'm still trying to find the stupid

2430
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:12,680
way back to whatever the Narshe Town is.

2431
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:18,320
So it goes to show just how long it's been since I've played that damn game.

2432
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:19,320
Next email?

2433
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,320
Next email.

2434
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:24,760
I was just wondering, and I just started listening to the podcast, so I'm not certain if you

2435
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:28,720
guys have talked about this, what you guys thought about the makers of Psychonauts making

2436
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:29,720
a sequel.

2437
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:34,520
Seeing as how I think it was rated as 14th greatest Xbox, even though it wasn't a great

2438
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:39,360
seller to my knowledge, Xbox Live gamertag quick sticks.

2439
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:43,400
Excellent question, and you know, that's another one of those games I didn't play a lot of.

2440
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:47,520
I have played Psychonauts, just not a lot in depth.

2441
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:52,960
I don't see how it's a bad thing though, Psychonauts had a lot of fans, and a lot of people have

2442
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:55,600
been slowly discovering that game over the years.

2443
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:58,320
It's kind of like a cult game, like a cult movie.

2444
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:02,080
Not a lot of people see it when it first comes out, but it sells really well on DVD.

2445
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:04,080
People wanted to go back and check it out later, that's kind of what Psychonauts is.

2446
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:08,160
It's one of those games that people get together and sacrifice virgins on altars in the basement

2447
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:09,160
of their buildings.

2448
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:11,240
And drink the Kool-Aid, no, it's not that kind of game.

2449
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:18,720
But I didn't play enough of the first one to really say, oh, I'm excited about a sequel.

2450
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:22,660
But I know that the first game was unique enough with a cool sense of humor about it

2451
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:25,840
that I think a second game will be welcomed, and I bet you more people check out the sequel

2452
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,080
than the first one.

2453
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:30,200
And making a sequel, honestly, will get more people to check out the original, which is

2454
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:35,320
available as an Xbox Live original, if I'm not mistaken.

2455
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:40,560
One of our listeners, I guess, I'm never quite sure how to pronounce it, but I think it's

2456
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:41,560
Neige.

2457
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:47,760
But anyway, one of our British listeners saw a story on the BBC News website and linked

2458
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:54,520
it to us, which is a Germany arrest over gamer death, where a man is arrested in Germany

2459
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:59,680
on suspicion of the murder of a 20-year-old internet gamer in Nottingham.

2460
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:04,960
Checking out the article as soon as it loads up.

2461
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:10,520
And I'll link the article in the chat room, since it's very nice to share that with us.

2462
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:12,600
As soon as the damn thing loads.

2463
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:18,120
Matthew Pike, 20, was found stabbed in his flat above the Orange Tree Pub on North Sherwood

2464
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:19,880
Street on Friday.

2465
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:28,920
So the one arrested was a guy from Lindbergh, and apparently they, I guess, played the game

2466
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:29,920
together or something.

2467
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:34,120
I'm not seeing what game was listed in it, but they were friends over the internet and

2468
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:38,360
played games together, and dude's like, whatever, die, and kill him.

2469
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:42,320
At least, that's what they're thinking so far.

2470
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:45,600
So I'll link the article in the chat.

2471
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:49,520
That's sad, and stupid.

2472
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:53,080
So does that mean if you can't beat them, you should gank them?

2473
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:54,080
Nice.

2474
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:58,560
But thank you for sharing that with us.

2475
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:04,120
Also cheeseburger, somebody go smack cheeseburger around with the large child in the chat room

2476
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:07,120
for me, because the email was dongle.

2477
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:12,160
No, that was worth a day two weeks ago.

2478
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:15,080
When I got my Bluetooth dongle back in the day when I thought I could use it to transfer

2479
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:20,680
stuff on my phone, I thought that that was the single most freaking hilarious word in

2480
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:21,680
the universe.

2481
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:27,080
Because I mean, just saying dongle, it's almost as much fun as saying balls.

2482
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:28,080
Last email.

2483
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:29,080
Alrighty.

2484
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:31,080
This comes from Isabelle.

2485
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:34,880
These are just some photos me and my friend took for Pyramid Head Day.

2486
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:39,120
We made cupcakes with little pyramid head heads on top of them, and I made a pyramid

2487
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:40,400
head costume.

2488
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:41,520
Happy Pyramid Head Day.

2489
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:43,580
Hope Silent Hill Homecoming is awesome.

2490
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:46,880
But none of you get to see them, because I haven't actually uploaded them anywhere.

2491
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:49,080
They're on our email.

2492
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:54,520
But they are funny and cute, and Pyramid Head is tasty delicious.

2493
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:58,440
Hooray for Pyramid Head Day.

2494
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:03,380
Well I'm really glad that people actually went and celebrated Pyramid Head Day.

2495
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:04,380
That's wonderful.

2496
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:06,640
I hope we get more pictures of the coming weeks.

2497
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:07,840
It's Pee-Hitty Day.

2498
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:08,840
Pee-Hitty Day.

2499
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:11,000
Vote or Pee-Hitty will kill you.

2500
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Seriously.

2501
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,560
That's it?

2502
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:14,560
For email.

2503
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:18,440
Alright, if you want to send us an email next time, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2504
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:21,320
Wouldn't it be Pee-Hitty?

2505
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:22,320
Shut up.

2506
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:23,320
I don't know.

2507
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:24,320
You know what it is?

2508
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:26,320
It's whatever I say it is.

2509
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:28,600
It's whatever you say it is.

2510
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:29,600
Nice.

2511
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:37,600
As before the mailbag, we were talking a little bit about some game companies, and of course

2512
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:43,760
other game companies, other than Activision, but I'm sure they agree on this, Bungee.

2513
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:50,080
The game developer believes that game companies should pocket money from used game sales.

2514
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:57,980
And it seems, I guess, that they feel since the used sales, like for example, had a big

2515
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:05,000
impact on Halo, and when you have a multi-million dollar seller game, and I guess they're losing

2516
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:10,720
money on used copies of the game, because people buy those instead of a new copy, and

2517
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:19,680
you can thank GameStop for a lot of that too, they feel that they want a piece of that pie.

2518
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:24,940
So I think they're wrong though, because that's retarded.

2519
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:29,160
If I buy something and I sell it to somebody else, why should you get a piece of that?

2520
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:35,800
Yeah, like if I sell my refrigerator to someone else, because I'm going to get a newer, fancier

2521
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:39,360
refrigerator, I don't have to send Maytag 20 bucks.

2522
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:40,360
You know what I mean?

2523
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:45,400
Yeah, it's basically like, you know, I saw some comments or something, talkbacks about

2524
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:51,120
it, and it's like, you own your money 100%, and it's all bartering basically, because

2525
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:55,880
you're trading your money for 100% ownership of said game.

2526
02:12:55,880 --> 02:13:02,080
So if they want a portion of when you sell that game, then you should get a portion of

2527
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:05,840
the money that they spend on, say, when they buy groceries.

2528
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:08,480
CD industries had to deal with this for years, it hasn't killed them.

2529
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,720
Piracy killed the CD industry.

2530
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:11,720
Exactly.

2531
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:18,060
I think, I mean, used game sales can be good, because you say a consumer doesn't really

2532
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:22,840
want to buy your game at full price, and say they buy Halo 1, and then they'll like it,

2533
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:25,840
and then they go out and buy Halo 2 when it comes out.

2534
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:26,840
So it's extra sales.

2535
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:31,080
I don't see how this is a bad thing, and besides, you already got paid, okay?

2536
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:36,620
I mean, why are they even complaining about the fact that they don't sell as many units?

2537
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:39,680
Because they've already sold those units to retail stores.

2538
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:46,200
The retail stores now have to sell them, you know, and if they decide to sell used games

2539
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:51,000
over new games, like a lot of these game stores like GameStop, they push their used sales,

2540
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:56,140
in fact, if they have a used copy in, they'll be like, hey, do you want the used copy instead?

2541
02:13:56,140 --> 02:13:59,060
They push those first because they're making more money off of them anyways, so what's

2542
02:13:59,060 --> 02:14:00,060
it matter?

2543
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:03,960
Because they've already paid you for the product, you're not losing out on anything.

2544
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:08,200
The Rob D. has an interesting comment in chat, guess what, developers, DLC exists, give us

2545
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:09,560
a reason to keep it.

2546
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:11,320
Even better, make additional content free.

2547
02:14:11,320 --> 02:14:12,320
Exactly.

2548
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:13,320
Give us a reason to keep your game.

2549
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:16,360
Just build the contents where it's at, because that's a way you can make more money off of

2550
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:18,160
each game you sell.

2551
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:21,000
I don't know.

2552
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,680
But yeah, I definitely don't think that they should ever get to the point where they have

2553
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:27,040
to, you know, get a portion of used sales.

2554
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:28,040
That's just stupid.

2555
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:33,560
Alright, well, moving on to people that want, other people that want a piece of the pie.

2556
02:14:33,560 --> 02:14:40,600
Activision Blizzard has gone on the record, the CEO Bobby Kotick has said some, basically

2557
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:48,200
a response to what the Warner Music executive Edgar Bronfman said previously, and what he

2558
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:52,080
had said was that the royalty rates for songs that are used in like Guitar Hero, Rock Band

2559
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:55,080
and so on are paltry.

2560
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:57,720
Basically that they're getting paid peanuts, they're not getting paid enough money for

2561
02:14:57,720 --> 02:14:59,440
using the music in these games.

2562
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:04,400
Well, the Activision CEO, Bobby Kotick, has come back and said the comment was one-sided.

2563
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:09,640
In fact, he says that these games that have the licensed tracks in them, they have a significant

2564
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:13,040
impact on the record and ticket sales of the contributing artist.

2565
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:17,880
So he's kind of thinking aloud, maybe that the musicians, quote, should be paying any

2566
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:22,200
money, or I'm sorry, the companies, quote, should be paying any money at all to the musicians,

2567
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:24,480
and whether it should be the reverse.

2568
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:27,720
Maybe people should be paying them to put their songs in the game.

2569
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:29,640
It's like free advertising.

2570
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:34,880
No, because the songs make the game, and if, you know, you want to take that route and

2571
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:39,480
like, well, we're not going to put any songs in our game unless you pay us to do it, yeah,

2572
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:41,960
go right ahead and see what your song list looks like then.

2573
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:42,960
Right.

2574
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:43,960
That's a very good point.

2575
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:46,160
Without these songs, then the game is going to be nothing, but at the same time, there's

2576
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:50,560
kind of a fine line here, because I think if these guys get too greedy, you know, especially

2577
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:54,920
if it's one company over the others, then, you know, they'll be able to still put out

2578
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:59,480
a perfectly solid game from, you know, music from other labels that are out there.

2579
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:03,880
Well, just look at some other, like, other companies doing similar things.

2580
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:07,720
GameStop, and I'm sure this is true for a lot of other retailers as well, they charge

2581
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:10,660
companies to put their games in the store.

2582
02:16:10,660 --> 02:16:12,960
They charge them for shelf space.

2583
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:16,920
They actually, when they have, like, signage in their store for a certain game, they make

2584
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:20,120
those companies pay for that signage to be in their store.

2585
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:22,120
I mean, that's just ridiculous.

2586
02:16:22,120 --> 02:16:23,900
It's the same thing with this.

2587
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:27,040
They're saying, oh, well, our game is, you know, immensely popular, and because of it,

2588
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:28,680
your music is becoming more popular.

2589
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:32,540
Well, the reason people buy that game in the first place is because of your song list,

2590
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:36,920
and if your song list sucks, then people won't buy your game, and then you won't have your

2591
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:40,080
popularity.

2592
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:45,280
In my mind, both sides stand to lose something if they can't agree on it.

2593
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:49,320
And I would say, then, here's what I think it should say the way it is.

2594
02:16:49,320 --> 02:16:53,920
You're paying royalties, but they're not that big because in the back end, you know, obviously

2595
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:57,800
there's a reason why they're licensing their music to these games is because they know

2596
02:16:57,800 --> 02:17:03,400
the benefit of putting their songs in there, because it does, you know, drive up interest

2597
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:08,520
in certain bands and maybe introduce new bands that some people may not have decided to listen

2598
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:09,520
to before.

2599
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:10,880
I don't know.

2600
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:13,800
It's not a bad thing for either company, but as soon as they start getting greedy, that's

2601
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:16,200
when it's going to fall apart.

2602
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:21,200
SonicM88 in chat says, over at chat.orangelandrater.com, says, I discovered a lot of great songs in

2603
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:22,200
the Guitar Hero games.

2604
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:26,320
I love playing the game despite the fact that I didn't know most of the songs.

2605
02:17:26,320 --> 02:17:29,360
So you know, but there are some music game fans that are going to play these games no

2606
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:31,840
matter what, even if they don't know a single song in them.

2607
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:35,600
But I think certainly part of the reason why Guitar Hero really kind of broke out in some

2608
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:39,200
sense is because it was a lot of those songs you've always wanted to play on the guitar.

2609
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:40,200
You know what I mean?

2610
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:43,400
Plus they did a really good job marketing their game.

2611
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:46,320
I think as well, they got it out there in the press.

2612
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:49,660
You remember like, you remember when that guy went over to Jamie's house and you guys

2613
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:53,560
got interviewed for the news, that was probably because Red Octane put out a press release

2614
02:17:53,560 --> 02:17:56,280
about the game and was able to kind of call attention to it.

2615
02:17:56,280 --> 02:17:57,280
You know what I mean?

2616
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:01,320
They were very good at getting themselves in the papers and everything.

2617
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:02,320
Just kind of a thought.

2618
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:03,320
It's also pretty fun.

2619
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:10,560
I mean, on top of that, it just seemed to me like there was a much better appreciation,

2620
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:15,040
you know, to the gamers themselves that actually wanted to work with the community.

2621
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:16,040
Right.

2622
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:18,360
Alright, well let's move on with some more news.

2623
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:19,360
Okay.

2624
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:26,160
Well, um, Ghostbusters game, you know, they were working on the game and Bill Murray did

2625
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:30,900
his vocal recording, but he was also quoted as saying that he would be actually, he had

2626
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:36,760
such a good time in recording his voice and reprising his character's, you know, his character

2627
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:41,160
role that he'd actually like to do another Ghostbusters movie.

2628
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:46,480
So, you know, for all those rumors floating around about another Ghostbusters movie, that

2629
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:50,940
might actually be a little bit more likely, maybe.

2630
02:18:50,940 --> 02:18:51,940
We hope.

2631
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:56,160
As long as he's not too old for it.

2632
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:57,640
Well, we'll see.

2633
02:18:57,640 --> 02:19:01,680
Maybe he's realizing that some of these other movies he's making aren't exactly as good

2634
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:05,800
as, you know, he hasn't exactly been on a big movie streak lately.

2635
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:06,800
I don't know.

2636
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:10,120
I just couldn't see that Ghostbusters 3 would actually be that big of a movie if they did

2637
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:11,120
one.

2638
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:12,120
You know what I mean?

2639
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:14,760
Maybe a lot of it depends on star power and who they get in the movie, but if they don't

2640
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:18,280
have the right people in the movie, I don't know if there'd really be that much interest

2641
02:19:18,280 --> 02:19:19,440
in a Ghostbusters 3.

2642
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:21,120
You know what I mean?

2643
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:24,260
Tiger Claw says there is a third Ghostbusters movie in the works that's being written by

2644
02:19:24,260 --> 02:19:25,260
the writers of The Office.

2645
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:26,960
Wasn't that only a rumor?

2646
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:27,960
I think that was a rumor.

2647
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:28,960
I don't know.

2648
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:29,960
Hm.

2649
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:35,440
Anyways, there's one of the games that they were talking about at E3 that was Mag, the

2650
02:19:35,440 --> 02:19:40,780
massive, I don't know, massive action game, I guess, I can't remember what it stood for,

2651
02:19:40,780 --> 02:19:45,040
but it will apparently be not free to play.

2652
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:53,760
They are gonna plan on charging either a yearly or monthly fee, and they'll also have, I guess,

2653
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:57,440
one-time fees for content downloads as well.

2654
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:05,240
And also, I guess it mentions that they may have hosting partners, like EA and Activision.

2655
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:06,240
Hm.

2656
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:13,200
But, I don't know, I guess this is sort of, it didn't really seem like an MMO to me, but

2657
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:17,320
it is kind of surprising though that an online game like this won't be free to play, but

2658
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:22,000
I guess when you have 256 players, you probably need some serious network hardware for that.

2659
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Hm.

2660
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I don't know.

2661
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,280
We'll just hopefully make the game cheap to buy then, if that's the case, you know, like

2662
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:31,440
Warhawk or something where it's 40 bucks and it says 60.

2663
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:32,440
Yeah.

2664
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:33,440
Alright.

2665
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:35,920
Well, remember when we used to learn a lot of things from our games?

2666
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:39,800
Well, there was a little piece that's been circulating around different gaming blogs

2667
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:40,800
this week.

2668
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:45,760
It's from the Educational Games Research blog, which kind of puts out information regularly

2669
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:47,360
about educational games.

2670
02:20:47,360 --> 02:20:51,560
They compiled a list this week, the top 10 most influential educational video games from

2671
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:52,560
the 1980s.

2672
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:54,680
Now, keep in mind, it's just one guy's opinion.

2673
02:20:54,680 --> 02:21:00,340
It's someone who kind of, I guess, writes about education-related video games, not every

2674
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:02,000
now and then, but it's one guy's opinion.

2675
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,520
This is the top 10 most educational games in his mind.

2676
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:07,040
The Oregon Trail, of course, is number one.

2677
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:08,320
I mean, who doesn't remember that game?

2678
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:09,320
Hello.

2679
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:11,360
Because we've all died of dysentery at one time or another.

2680
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:15,400
Number two, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, which came up on last week's show, funny

2681
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:16,400
enough.

2682
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:18,480
Number three, SimCity.

2683
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:19,480
Number four, ReaderRabbit.

2684
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:21,840
Remember ReaderRabbit?

2685
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:27,080
Number five, MathBlaster, which was very similar to ReaderRabbit, or no, no, it weren't that

2686
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:29,720
they were similar, but it seems like both those games were kind of like hand-in-hand

2687
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:30,720
games.

2688
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:32,680
I don't know about you guys, but it seemed like when I was younger, those games kind

2689
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:33,760
of were hand-in-hand.

2690
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:36,920
Number six, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.

2691
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:39,940
Number seven, Lemonade Stand.

2692
02:21:39,940 --> 02:21:42,400
Number eight, Number Munchers.

2693
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:43,780
Number nine, Zork.

2694
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:47,580
I don't know if I'd call that an educational game, but I guess maybe because of the fact

2695
02:21:47,580 --> 02:21:50,200
you actually had to type out your words and thoughts.

2696
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:55,120
And number 10, which I find very strange, Windows Solitaire.

2697
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:58,900
I guess that's something that you're supposed to, you learn how to use the mouse with it,

2698
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:02,600
so it's an educational game, which I can see that, but it's just very odd to see that on

2699
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:03,600
this list.

2700
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:08,720
And number 11, M-U-L-E, which is strange because it's a top 10 list, but they put Mule on this

2701
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:13,080
list as well, which is a great game that I guess, you know, you kind of learn about barter

2702
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:16,880
and exchange in that game, but I don't know if I'd call that an educational game either.

2703
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:20,760
Of particular interest, why this story kind of piqued my interest, because I've seen this

2704
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:24,200
around on different gaming blog sites this week.

2705
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:30,080
I tackled this same topic a year ago on my personal blog that I was running for a while

2706
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:33,040
back when the All Games Radio Ning site was a little more popular.

2707
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:35,160
In fact, I'll link it here in chat.

2708
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:40,360
You can actually read my list here, and sorry for those guys that are listening on the podcast,

2709
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:46,240
you can't see this, but just go to allgamesradio.ning.com and look for my profile and you'll find this.

2710
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:50,400
This was my list of the top 10 edutainment games of all time, because I used to play

2711
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:51,920
a lot of them growing up.

2712
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:55,680
Number 10, The Incredible Machine, which I've noticed was missing from that list, but I

2713
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:59,200
think it's because he was doing a list from the 1980s and I did like an all-encompassing

2714
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:00,200
list.

2715
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:03,920
But I thought The Incredible Machine was definitely an educational game.

2716
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:09,640
Rocky's Boots was number nine on my list because I felt that Rocky's Boots, especially for

2717
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:13,680
somebody who's into computers, you learn a lot about logic in this game, which leads

2718
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:16,960
to programming, and Rocky's Boots is a hell of a lot of fun.

2719
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:20,460
Number eight, it's just Apple logo, because it was kind of like your first programming

2720
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:22,520
language that you would learn in school.

2721
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:25,460
Number seven, I also put Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.

2722
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:28,120
Number six, I also put Math Blasters.

2723
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:32,600
Number five, I put a game called Cave of the Word Wizard, that was a game that you had

2724
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:36,080
on the Commodore 64, and what made this game notable is that it actually used the Commodore

2725
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:40,720
64 speech chip to actually say the names of words that you would have to spell out to

2726
02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:45,880
the word wizard, where he'd take away your flashlight battery, and then if your battery

2727
02:23:45,880 --> 02:23:48,960
goes out, you basically die of death.

2728
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:50,280
You get eaten alive by bats.

2729
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:53,160
No, I don't know, but you don't want your flashlight battery to run out.

2730
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:56,960
And I put number four, where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego.

2731
02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:02,000
Number three, The Island of Dr. Brain, that was a great educational title, again, it wasn't

2732
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,400
the 80s, that's probably why it wasn't on the other guy's list.

2733
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:08,080
And then I put number two, Number Munchers, and number one, The Oregon Trail.

2734
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:13,760
So kind of funny that I don't profess to be an educational games expert, yet my list was

2735
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:17,040
pretty similar, except for the fact that I had a couple games from the 90s in there.

2736
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:21,820
So I don't know, I just thought I'd share that, because nobody read the article when

2737
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:23,480
I posted it the first time, so.

2738
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:26,480
Where's Leisure Suit Larry?

2739
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:28,560
It's not an educational game, Loki.

2740
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:35,680
I don't care what you think you learned from it, it is not technically an educational game.

2741
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:39,120
And Mae Satsuma is looking at my blog saying, man, did Number Munchers really look that

2742
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:40,120
bad?

2743
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:41,240
Yes it did, the first version did.

2744
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:44,500
They made prettier versions of it as time went on, but the very first version was very

2745
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:47,920
plain looking, it was Atari 2600 style graphics.

2746
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:52,040
Alright, enough about educational games, let's get back to brain rotting games.

2747
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:56,520
Hey, it's not brain rotting, it's just, well, violent.

2748
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:58,640
And violence is always good.

2749
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:02,360
It helps release tension or something.

2750
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:05,960
Well basically, this is some very good news.

2751
02:25:05,960 --> 02:25:11,640
For all of those people who had always, you know, had the, you must defeat Shen Long to

2752
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:17,180
stand a chance and thinking he was a, you know, this was a hidden character or something.

2753
02:25:17,180 --> 02:25:25,920
Actually Goken, who was supposed to be Ryu and Ken's teacher, is going to be a hidden

2754
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:30,000
character in the game, but he's not playable, he's just going to show up every so often

2755
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,600
and beat the crap out of you.

2756
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:33,600
Toasty.

2757
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:42,680
But it is, there is an unlock procedure for it, but he's going to be hardcore tough.

2758
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:43,680
Sweet.

2759
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:46,640
So yeah, that's pretty happy.

2760
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:51,080
Of course, you know, I have a feeling that someone's going to find some way to control

2761
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:52,320
him, blah blah blah.

2762
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:53,960
Or he'll be a download character.

2763
02:25:53,960 --> 02:25:56,800
Yep, pay to unlock.

2764
02:25:56,800 --> 02:26:03,080
Well, if it's, you know, if there's going to be another Grand Theft Auto game coming

2765
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:06,140
out, then there's got to be another controversy coming with it.

2766
02:26:06,140 --> 02:26:09,780
And of course, with the announcement of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, and now that more

2767
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:13,840
details are leaking out about it, people are throwing a fit.

2768
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:19,080
In fact, the British tabloid The Sun, which for some reason is now covering video game

2769
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:29,160
stuff every now and then, has a headline called Fury Over Drug Deal Vid Game, and of course

2770
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:36,760
includes comments from a guy named Darren Gold of a support group called Drugsline,

2771
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:41,200
and anything using drug dealing as entertainment is sending out the wrong message.

2772
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:47,680
Glamorism doesn't help our work in trying to educate kids of the dangers of substance

2773
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,160
misuse.

2774
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:50,680
Awesome!

2775
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:51,680
And you know what?

2776
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:56,580
I agree with you in the fact that kids should be taught about, you know, drugs and how bad

2777
02:26:56,580 --> 02:26:57,580
they are and stuff.

2778
02:26:57,580 --> 02:27:02,700
The other thing is kids should be playing this game because it's rated M. So, my God,

2779
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:03,700
people please.

2780
02:27:03,700 --> 02:27:10,200
And in case, if you didn't notice, you can sell drugs in this game because Grand Theft

2781
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:15,040
Auto likes to piss people off and controversy sells, so awesome.

2782
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:19,240
But remember, parents, the ratings are on the box for a reason.

2783
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:22,040
And you know, if you don't really give a shit about the ratings, then do your kids a favor

2784
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:23,440
and buy them porn.

2785
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:28,360
DJ Dark Knight in chat says, winners don't use drugs.

2786
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:30,240
Remember the old FBI warning?

2787
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:33,520
Which by the way, have you ever noticed that in, I don't think it's in Rock Band 1, but

2788
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:37,660
in Rock Band 2, there's an arcade level that you play in, and you can, if you actually

2789
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:41,580
look at the screens, one of them has that little FBI warning on it that says winners

2790
02:27:41,580 --> 02:27:42,580
don't use drugs.

2791
02:27:42,580 --> 02:27:44,000
I thought that was pretty awesome.

2792
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,960
Kudos to whoever at Harmonix snuck that in.

2793
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:49,160
Good job, you.

2794
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:53,480
Tigerclaw posted a link in chat of some pictures of the drug dealing mini-game.

2795
02:27:53,480 --> 02:27:57,360
Which is strange because haven't no pictures of this game been released?

2796
02:27:57,360 --> 02:27:58,360
No, they have been.

2797
02:27:58,360 --> 02:28:04,960
They were in a game magazine called Game, was it Nintendo Power, yes, I'm sure no one's

2798
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:05,960
heard of it.

2799
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:06,960
Nice.

2800
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:10,280
And it would not be addressed to children at all.

2801
02:28:10,280 --> 02:28:12,700
No, but seriously though, it's a mature rated game.

2802
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:13,700
Come on, folks.

2803
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:16,280
I mean, do you really need to know what Grand Theft Auto is?

2804
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:20,240
I mean, are you really assuming that it's like Grand Theft Auto babies or something

2805
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:23,880
like that because it's coming to the DS that might be friendly for kids?

2806
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:25,920
That they're just stealing lunch money or something?

2807
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:27,760
I mean, come on.

2808
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:33,440
Alright, well, one- It's like saying, oh my god, fire's hot.

2809
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:36,500
One more piece of- It is?

2810
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:39,160
One more piece of kind of late breaking news for you guys.

2811
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:45,480
It's very big rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor, apparently over at an Xbox India event that

2812
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:52,280
have happened over in Delhi, India, apparently has been confirmed, I use that term loosely

2813
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:59,000
though, that there will be a slim Xbox 360 console that will be released in 2009.

2814
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,400
This is coming from some Indian gaming blogs.

2815
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:06,240
Apparently they are also saying that India is going to be getting some time with Fable

2816
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:11,760
2, Gears of War 2, and Fallout 3 a week earlier than supposedly anyone else is supposed to

2817
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:12,760
be.

2818
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:13,760
Hmm.

2819
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:14,760
I'm quite skeptical.

2820
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:17,200
Well, they may get to try it a week before it comes out, but big deal.

2821
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:19,000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

2822
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,240
I don't know though.

2823
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:25,080
I mean, I guess a redesign of the console makes sense, although they never redesigned

2824
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:26,080
the original Xbox.

2825
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:27,880
They didn't really let it live its full life either.

2826
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:31,040
They kind of rushed the 360 out.

2827
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,400
By the way, Major Nelson has actually commented on it.

2828
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:38,080
He told popular blog Xbox 360 Fanboy that, quote, I have no knowledge of an event in

2829
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:41,000
India and therefore anything related to one.

2830
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:45,280
I think we all know that if we had something to say, we'd be saying it.

2831
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:46,640
Hmm.

2832
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:47,720
Very interesting.

2833
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:52,080
I think though, I think a redesign of the console will come in the future, but I can't

2834
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:56,020
imagine a version of the console where I can't use the same hard drive, or I'd be pretty

2835
02:29:56,020 --> 02:29:57,020
pissed.

2836
02:29:57,020 --> 02:30:00,080
I don't know about you guys, I'd be mad if I couldn't plug that same hard drive into

2837
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:01,080
a new console.

2838
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:05,240
Plus, why would I, I wouldn't even get the new console unless I had something, like let's

2839
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:08,680
say it had a digital camera built in, or maybe had music playback.

2840
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:11,800
A digital camera built in to a console?

2841
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:14,540
Yeah, because a console really uses the camera.

2842
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:16,920
By the way, that reminds me, I gotta buy- It was a DS joke.

2843
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:18,220
Yeah, I know it was a DS joke.

2844
02:30:18,220 --> 02:30:19,220
I caught that.

2845
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:20,560
Oh my god, really?

2846
02:30:20,560 --> 02:30:21,920
Was that something we talked about earlier?

2847
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:22,920
You know, it was.

2848
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:25,000
It was what we call like a loopback joke.

2849
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,580
I know, that's so crazy.

2850
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:30,400
It's like, it's like referring- Have you been paying attention for the past hour?

2851
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:36,080
It's like almost like foreshadowing, but in the reverse, backshadowing.

2852
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:38,200
Any other smartass comments before I open up the Skype line?

2853
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:43,080
No, I was gonna say that more people will need to buy a camera for LittleBigPlanet,

2854
02:30:43,080 --> 02:30:47,120
I guess, when it comes out, because it uses the Playstation Eye heavily.

2855
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:49,840
So are you encouraging people to run out and buy Eye of Judgement so they can get the camera?

2856
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,080
Fuck no, but it's a waste of money.

2857
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:52,880
Buy the camera, it's cheaper.

2858
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:53,880
Alright.

2859
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:56,400
1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call.

2860
02:30:56,400 --> 02:31:01,200
We have time for a couple of calls here tonight, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2861
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,200
That's all one word.

2862
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:03,200
You can call us right now.

2863
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:04,760
The Skype line is open.

2864
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:06,880
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2865
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:07,880
Who's this?

2866
02:31:07,880 --> 02:31:08,880
Hey, hey, it's Rama.

2867
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:09,880
Hey, Rama.

2868
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:10,880
How you doing?

2869
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:11,880
Pretty good.

2870
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:14,840
Tired from this weekend, but other than that, I'm doing alright.

2871
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:19,000
So you know, I got pictures on my cell phone from you this weekend, so I know what this

2872
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,000
means.

2873
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:24,840
Rama went to another con, yet again- And I have a surprise, I want you to take a look

2874
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:25,840
at this picture.

2875
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:26,840
I'll post it in the chat room.

2876
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:27,840
Okay.

2877
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:28,840
You might call him a con man.

2878
02:31:28,840 --> 02:31:30,840
No, I'm a con whore.

2879
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:31,840
Con whore.

2880
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:34,840
Alright, you're the one that called you a whore.

2881
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:35,840
I'm looking.

2882
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:36,840
Right now?

2883
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:42,040
Okay, he's linked me to popular blog Joystiq and a picture in their art gallery of some

2884
02:31:42,040 --> 02:31:43,960
folks dressed up as Castle Crashers.

2885
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:44,960
That's cute.

2886
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:45,960
Cute.

2887
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:46,960
That's very cute.

2888
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:49,440
I was following them for about 20 minutes and I could not get a picture and I kept getting

2889
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:50,440
stopped.

2890
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:51,440
Why?

2891
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:53,400
Were you dressed up as something too?

2892
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:58,040
I was dressed as Ranma and people were stopping for my picture half the time.

2893
02:31:58,040 --> 02:31:59,040
Gotcha.

2894
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:00,040
Yeah.

2895
02:32:00,040 --> 02:32:02,480
That's a very nice, cool little outfit though.

2896
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:04,760
Oh, I'm looking at the gallery though at the bottom of this page.

2897
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:06,000
There's somebody dressed as Kirby.

2898
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,000
That looks cute.

2899
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:12,160
It's actually somebody tall, but the costume is designed where they can just sit down inside

2900
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:14,960
it and roll around, kinda sorta.

2901
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:16,240
That's a cute little Kirby.

2902
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:20,880
Okay, now while you've got me ogling these pictures of cosplay, I mean, how was the con?

2903
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:24,960
And of course, you know, the gaming components of it, were there lots of gaming cosplay at

2904
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,960
the con?

2905
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:32,240
Actually no, and when it comes to gaming, what is this gaming that you speak of?

2906
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:33,680
What do you mean?

2907
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:36,760
There was only one game at the convention.

2908
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:39,760
Wow, what was that?

2909
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:42,840
Ubisoft's Naruto 2 for Xbox 360.

2910
02:32:42,840 --> 02:32:45,760
Of course, because that ties directly back in anime.

2911
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:48,960
Yeah, they had like two big screens up for demo play.

2912
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:50,760
That was the only game that they had.

2913
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:53,280
That's a cool little Kingdom Hearts cosplay.

2914
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:54,280
Where's the game room?

2915
02:32:54,280 --> 02:32:55,520
They're like, what's the game room?

2916
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:56,520
I'm like, oh damn.

2917
02:32:56,520 --> 02:32:59,500
Sorry, I'm looking, I know this is horrible radio, but I'm looking at this Kingdom Hearts

2918
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:01,280
cosplay of somebody dressed up as a Heartless.

2919
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:02,280
That's pretty awesome, actually.

2920
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:05,480
I've seen a few of those running around.

2921
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:09,580
So not a lot of gaming content at this convention, is it just because they just want to brandish

2922
02:33:09,580 --> 02:33:13,000
themselves as strictly, you know, it is an anime festival after all, they just want to

2923
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,960
be strictly anime and nothing else?

2924
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:16,720
No, there's no general rule.

2925
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:18,560
I guess it's just, people want it.

2926
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:24,020
It was just mostly, I really didn't see a lot of cosplay myself, and I was in the dealer's

2927
02:33:24,020 --> 02:33:26,520
room in the thicket of it all.

2928
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:29,680
That's kind of weird though, because it looks like there was quite a bit of gaming cosplay

2929
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:34,560
for a con that didn't really have gaming.

2930
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:35,560
Go fig, you know?

2931
02:33:35,560 --> 02:33:36,560
Oh, that's cool.

2932
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:40,800
There's a whole little trio there dressed up like the Whirlins with you, those characters.

2933
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:43,000
That's kind of neat.

2934
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Huh.

2935
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
So, good con?

2936
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Fun time?

2937
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,560
It was an improvement over last year's, but it could have been better.

2938
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:53,040
I walked in and I'm like, where's the con?

2939
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:57,000
I'm like, it's downstairs in the basement, whereas last year, and I'm thinking since

2940
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:02,360
there was no digital life, it's going to be upstairs like Comic-Con was, but it wasn't.

2941
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:06,320
Oh, this was the convention that goes on the same time as digital life?

2942
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:07,320
Yes.

2943
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:11,400
Oh, so digital life would have happened this past weekend, had it happened.

2944
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:12,400
Yes.

2945
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:13,400
Oh, interesting.

2946
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:16,680
All right, well, anything else you want to say about the convention before we get some

2947
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:17,680
more calls?

2948
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:20,800
The only thing that really annoyed me was that you had to pay extra for concerts and

2949
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:21,800
autographs.

2950
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:24,800
I mean, they get Ominous Autograph with $60.

2951
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:25,800
What?

2952
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:27,280
That's a little weird.

2953
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:29,040
I haven't heard of cons doing that before.

2954
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,440
They get away with it, though?

2955
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:34,840
Yeah, comic book conventions are known for doing it, but not anime conventions, but since

2956
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:39,920
I could not get Jamie her autograph, I got her a little gift to really cheer her up,

2957
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:42,120
and I'm posting a picture of it in the chat room right now.

2958
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:43,120
Okay.

2959
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:47,200
I'm going to do one of her all-time favorite movies.

2960
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:49,600
I'm going to look right now, too.

2961
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:50,600
Ha!

2962
02:34:50,600 --> 02:34:52,600
That's great.

2963
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:53,840
That's great.

2964
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:54,840
What is it?

2965
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:55,840
Winchester Tavern.

2966
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:58,320
Did you see Song of the Dead?

2967
02:34:58,320 --> 02:35:00,800
Oh my God, okay.

2968
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:01,800
Wow.

2969
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:04,200
I bought three of those.

2970
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:06,040
That is kind of randomly awesome.

2971
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:08,040
That is so sweet.

2972
02:35:08,040 --> 02:35:11,480
Where the hell did you find that at an anime con?

2973
02:35:11,480 --> 02:35:14,360
It was on a dealer's table with shirts.

2974
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:17,160
There's actually a Song of the Dead cosplay now, so why not?

2975
02:35:17,160 --> 02:35:21,200
Yeah, I saw that at a couple other cons I'd been to.

2976
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:25,840
You know they had Song of the Dead on the big screen in San Francisco not that long

2977
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:26,840
ago?

2978
02:35:26,840 --> 02:35:27,840
I was watching Hot Fuzz yesterday.

2979
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:28,840
Nice.

2980
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:29,840
All right.

2981
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:30,840
That's so sweet.

2982
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:31,840
Thank you.

2983
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:34,960
Well, Rama, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for

2984
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:36,920
bringing us to our show.

2985
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:37,920
No problem.

2986
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:38,920
See you later.

2987
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:39,920
Have a good one, buddy.

2988
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:40,920
All right.

2989
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:41,920
Thank you.

2990
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:43,720
I keep forgetting to ask him if he's coming back for Fanime in 2009.

2991
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:44,720
I think he said he was, right?

2992
02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:45,720
Want to hold him to that?

2993
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:46,720
I hope so.

2994
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:47,720
I hope so too.

2995
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:48,720
All right.

2996
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:52,240
Orange Lounge Radio, our username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR, if you want to call us the

2997
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:53,240
old-fashioned way.

2998
02:35:53,240 --> 02:35:55,400
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2999
02:35:55,400 --> 02:35:56,400
Who's this?

3000
02:35:56,400 --> 02:36:03,080
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land, it is he who likes to whore a bunch of time in live

3001
02:36:03,080 --> 02:36:04,080
shows and podcasts.

3002
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:07,480
I was going to say, you were just on Bobby's show like three hours ago.

3003
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:08,480
Yes, yes, yes, it was.

3004
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:09,480
No, that's all right.

3005
02:36:09,480 --> 02:36:12,840
I was asking you to our program, especially with all the work you've done for our show,

3006
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:14,640
how could we not have you on the program?

3007
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:16,680
You have a good radio voice, now I have something good to say.

3008
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:19,100
So what does he want to say tonight, Jason?

3009
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:25,840
I was kind of offended by Loki's remarks going, I'm not just whoring time, I'm whoring time

3010
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:28,480
about the exact same thing all over again.

3011
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:33,280
I have to take some offense to what Loki was saying about favorite studios online and all

3012
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:34,280
that nonsense.

3013
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:37,200
I'm sorry, say that again?

3014
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:42,440
Loki's developers are lazy, fabled to, no online co-op immediately, this, that, and

3015
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:43,440
the other.

3016
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:46,420
I have to take a little bit of offense to that.

3017
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:48,360
Why is that?

3018
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:52,360
Developers are not lazy and maybe it's a bit of respect that I'm getting out of the fact

3019
02:36:52,360 --> 02:37:00,040
that I work at a job that has a lot of developers and when things don't go right and you find

3020
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:04,440
out about them, it becomes a losing situation no matter what you try to do.

3021
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:11,000
You either cut the feature out, you push the product back, you release it in a hodgepodge

3022
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:15,960
and everybody complains and you fix it again.

3023
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:19,020
It's no simple matter and developers typically aren't lazy.

3024
02:37:19,020 --> 02:37:21,440
Lazy developers are the people who make big rigs.

3025
02:37:21,440 --> 02:37:25,240
Besides that and New World Order, those people don't really exist in the software industry

3026
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:27,240
that means anything.

3027
02:37:27,240 --> 02:37:35,920
What about the fact that this was one of the biggest things that they were pushing in this

3028
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:38,080
game and now it's not there anymore?

3029
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:42,520
That to me is kind of what makes it, what they're doing here, newsworthy.

3030
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:45,480
If it had been just a little feature, I bet most of us wouldn't have blinked an eye at

3031
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:49,080
it but this is a pretty big thing that they were selling in the game and now they've just

3032
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:53,120
basically said, well it's not really going to be there the first day, sorry.

3033
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:57,720
Yeah, and the game was really big and the engine to power it too.

3034
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:01,040
You have to have the game before you have the online component.

3035
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:07,640
And if they had detrimental lag, rendering issues or anything, I haven't even read into

3036
02:38:07,640 --> 02:38:12,280
the details but just on a purely, I don't even know what the word is, just on a purely

3037
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:17,260
basic level, things don't go perfectly as planned.

3038
02:38:17,260 --> 02:38:22,720
How long have they had this release date that they're going to make because they're going

3039
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:24,920
to finish without this feature?

3040
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:29,920
Why not push the release date two weeks back to give us all the features?

3041
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:35,240
Basically what it boils down to is there's no right or wrong way to do it but no matter

3042
02:38:35,240 --> 02:38:40,600
what you do, if you don't have a perfect product and nobody does, if you don't have a perfect

3043
02:38:40,600 --> 02:38:44,080
product, it's a no-win situation.

3044
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:49,200
Something as big as this is definitely worse but it's a no-win situation to the developers

3045
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:55,240
who try and try and try and make one of these decisions because they're trying to make things

3046
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:57,200
better for their consumers.

3047
02:38:57,200 --> 02:39:00,200
But there's a lot of times, I mean, and don't get me wrong, I know developers work hard

3048
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:04,420
but there's a lot of times that games come out and I'm sure the people actually coding

3049
02:39:04,420 --> 02:39:08,760
this stuff, yeah, they work hard but I'm wondering about some of those QA stuff because there's

3050
02:39:08,760 --> 02:39:15,160
a lot of games, especially from certain companies a lot, certain publishers, that are really

3051
02:39:15,160 --> 02:39:16,440
messed up when they come out.

3052
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:21,080
I mean, seriously, there's no way.

3053
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:25,320
I mean, and that is who I'm calling lazy.

3054
02:39:25,320 --> 02:39:30,720
Bigger's new world order, like I said, there are definitely the examples but those people

3055
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:36,040
who are that blatant go away never to be heard from again and we laugh them on the way out.

3056
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:40,520
Well, not really because I mean look at like EA, a lot of recent sports games have had

3057
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:46,420
pretty bad problems in them and Mercenaries 2, I have to keep going back to this but seriously

3058
02:39:46,420 --> 02:39:51,800
oh my God, there is no way that these glitches, they couldn't have caught this stuff because

3059
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:57,000
I run into them so often in this game, anybody playtesting this stuff through would have

3060
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:00,080
run into at least a dozen of these each time.

3061
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:03,520
Just to say though, sometimes I got to, just in defense of people who QA games because

3062
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:06,960
I know we have a lot of them that actually listen to this show, sometimes they find these

3063
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:09,780
bugs and they report back and their superiors just don't care.

3064
02:40:09,780 --> 02:40:12,320
It's kind of one of those things where it's like we don't have the time to fix it.

3065
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:13,320
Okay.

3066
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:18,960
Well then, either way, it looks bad on the publishing company then.

3067
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:26,480
Jason, any other thoughts on this?

3068
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:34,280
I have spent my time, I do have to echo SSJ100 Matt though, I did play NHL08, well the demo

3069
02:40:34,280 --> 02:40:39,700
at least but I'm sure that was indicative enough of the actual game and I had pucks

3070
02:40:39,700 --> 02:40:45,480
going through the ice and I had a lot of funny things happening, NHL09 has been pretty solid

3071
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:46,480
so far.

3072
02:40:46,480 --> 02:40:48,120
I'm definitely enjoying that.

3073
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:53,560
I think it's the first sports game, it's a simulation that I like.

3074
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:56,400
Even better than Blades of Steel?

3075
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:58,140
Like I said, simulation.

3076
02:40:58,140 --> 02:41:03,280
Everything else of that age was arcade style but this is actually a sim that I'm thoroughly

3077
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:04,280
enjoying.

3078
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:05,280
Fair enough, fair enough.

3079
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,640
Alright well Jason, we're going to let you go so we can try and get one more call but

3080
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:09,800
thanks of course for the call and the insight.

3081
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:10,800
We appreciate it.

3082
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:11,800
Good day.

3083
02:41:11,800 --> 02:41:12,800
Alright, have a good one.

3084
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:13,800
Bye.

3085
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:17,560
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,

3086
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:21,100
if you'd like to give us a call, we'll probably take like one more call and then call it a

3087
02:41:21,100 --> 02:41:25,520
night here at Orange Lounge Radio and get to wrapping up the show.

3088
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:28,320
Real quick though, while we wait for the call, do we have any last minute stories?

3089
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:32,960
This isn't really a story but it was a video that appeared on YouTube but it's now gone

3090
02:41:32,960 --> 02:41:33,960
on YouTube.

3091
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:39,920
GameStop, some of them store their consoles in their bathroom so I hope you like pee on

3092
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:41,640
your console.

3093
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:43,520
Ew.

3094
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:50,040
Well I heard this also from that, was it that Zero, I don't remember, the guy that was mimicking

3095
02:41:50,040 --> 02:41:54,640
Zero Punctuation but bashing GameStop, he said the same thing about consoles in the

3096
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:59,920
bathroom and now they have a video of it and it got taken down off of YouTube apparently.

3097
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:06,000
First of all, and I can say this from my experience of being in a number of GameStops in the area,

3098
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,480
sometimes they're given such little storage space they actually have no choice but to

3099
02:42:10,480 --> 02:42:19,920
put things in the bathroom but if anyone is urinating or defecating on the console, I

3100
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:28,080
would definitely think there'd be a way to tell by the box it's contained in so...

3101
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:30,320
What smells in here?

3102
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:32,720
Must be something the Sony's putting with the PlayStation.

3103
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:36,920
I think there's absolutely no problem with them keeping a console in the bathroom.

3104
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:41,400
As long as, you know, it's kept away from the toilet and sink it's fine.

3105
02:42:41,400 --> 02:42:44,200
They need the storage space, they need the storage space.

3106
02:42:44,200 --> 02:42:48,840
I just don't understand why a GameStop is a company that can't just, I don't know, spend

3107
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:53,120
some of that 7.5 billion dollars that you're making or whatever and maybe...

3108
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:55,640
Two words, bottom line.

3109
02:42:55,640 --> 02:43:01,720
As long as no one's dipping their balls on them, that's the most important thing.

3110
02:43:01,720 --> 02:43:03,760
Next time I go buy a console and I'm going to wonder...

3111
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:04,760
It's a feature, what?

3112
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:07,680
Alright, Luke, we've got somebody on hold on the line, I want to get to them.

3113
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:10,080
Hi, Aaron, Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

3114
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:11,960
Hey there, Orange Launch Radio, this is Dekeman.

3115
02:43:11,960 --> 02:43:13,800
Hey, Dekeman, what's on your mind, buddy?

3116
02:43:13,800 --> 02:43:17,280
Oh, not a lot, I just wanted to pimp a game that I don't think I've really heard anybody

3117
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:18,960
talking about the last couple of weeks.

3118
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:19,960
Oh, please, by all means.

3119
02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:20,960
Uh, DeBlob, for Wii.

3120
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:25,280
I don't know if you guys have seen this game, but it's awesome.

3121
02:43:25,280 --> 02:43:28,320
I've been playing it pretty much all day and it's frickin' fantastic.

3122
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:31,920
I know, I saw it at PAX, I watched Loki play it at PAX, actually.

3123
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:34,200
You remember the blob game where you were painting the walls different colors?

3124
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:35,200
Yeah, it was alright.

3125
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:36,200
Yeah?

3126
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:37,200
What's makes it...

3127
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:38,200
I've just been loving it.

3128
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:39,200
It feels like playing Katamari Damacy.

3129
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:43,760
I don't know, it just gives me that same feeling of just, you know, just a fun time.

3130
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:46,760
Awesome, so that's kind of what makes this game to you?

3131
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:49,520
Because keep in mind, we only saw like a few minutes of it at an expo.

3132
02:43:49,520 --> 02:43:54,000
We can't really form a full opinion on the game based on that, so is it just the fun

3133
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,000
factor?

3134
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Yeah.

3135
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
What kind of stuff do you do in this game?

3136
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,000
What makes it so fun?

3137
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:02,200
Basically, you just play as like a gelatinous blob that can take on different colors, and

3138
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:05,760
then you roll around the city, and every time you touch a building or an object, it just

3139
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:07,400
explodes with color.

3140
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:10,520
And you start off in a completely black and white, desolate world, and then you start

3141
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:13,560
touching buildings and the whole city just comes to life.

3142
02:44:13,560 --> 02:44:18,120
It's really quite impressive, especially for a third-party Wii title.

3143
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:20,600
That was that one that we saw at PAX, right?

3144
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:22,720
Yeah, I don't remember if you were there.

3145
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:24,160
I think you were elsewhere on the ship.

3146
02:44:24,160 --> 02:44:25,160
I was there.

3147
02:44:25,160 --> 02:44:26,160
Did you?

3148
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:27,160
Because I grabbed the little comic book that came out with it.

3149
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:28,160
Oh.

3150
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:29,160
I thought we were there several times.

3151
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:30,160
That was lots of fun.

3152
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:31,160
I really enjoyed it in that one.

3153
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:32,160
Oh, it is.

3154
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:33,160
It's fantastic.

3155
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:34,160
Hmm.

3156
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:36,760
So you literally get to paint the town red, as Frisbee says in chat.

3157
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:39,200
Yeah, pretty much.

3158
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:40,200
It's great.

3159
02:44:40,200 --> 02:44:41,200
Seriously, check it out if you get the chance.

3160
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:42,200
Nice.

3161
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:43,200
Okay.

3162
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:44,200
Well, we might have to check that out.

3163
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:45,200
Is it only on Wii?

3164
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:46,200
Or did they put it on other systems?

3165
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:49,440
No, it's only on Wii, but like I said, it is easily the best third-party Wii title I've

3166
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:50,440
ever seen.

3167
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:51,440
Huh.

3168
02:44:51,440 --> 02:44:52,440
Very cool.

3169
02:44:52,440 --> 02:44:53,440
Yeah.

3170
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:54,440
What did you play with us?

3171
02:44:54,440 --> 02:44:56,440
Uh, Samba de Amigo for the Wii.

3172
02:44:56,440 --> 02:44:57,440
Ah.

3173
02:44:57,440 --> 02:45:00,360
How did that turn out?

3174
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:01,360
What's that?

3175
02:45:01,360 --> 02:45:02,360
How did that game turn out?

3176
02:45:02,360 --> 02:45:04,440
Because I'd be curious to pick it up, but there's just so much other stuff I'm playing

3177
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:05,440
right now.

3178
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:06,440
I haven't had a chance.

3179
02:45:06,440 --> 02:45:07,920
The controls are kind of here and there.

3180
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:11,120
They could really touch you, but I think that once you play with it for a couple of hours,

3181
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:14,840
you really get the idea of how to control the game, but that's really the only problem

3182
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:15,840
I've had with it.

3183
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:20,360
The track list is fantastic, so yeah, I'm enjoying it.

3184
02:45:20,360 --> 02:45:21,360
Very cool.

3185
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:22,360
Huh.

3186
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:23,360
All right.

3187
02:45:23,360 --> 02:45:24,360
Well.

3188
02:45:24,360 --> 02:45:25,360
Okay.

3189
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:26,360
Well.

3190
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:29,800
Oh, have you had fun posing in Samba de Amigo?

3191
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:30,800
That's the most important part.

3192
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:31,800
Oh, yeah.

3193
02:45:31,800 --> 02:45:33,800
In the hustle mode?

3194
02:45:33,800 --> 02:45:34,800
Fantastic.

3195
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:36,000
They really beefed it up.

3196
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,240
I'll play that mode more than the regular mode.

3197
02:45:38,240 --> 02:45:39,240
Awesome.

3198
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:40,240
All right.

3199
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:41,240
Well, thanks so much for the call, Dekeman.

3200
02:45:41,240 --> 02:45:42,240
We've got to go and wrap up the show.

3201
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:43,240
Yep.

3202
02:45:43,240 --> 02:45:44,240
No worries.

3203
02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:45,240
Take care, guys.

3204
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:46,240
Have a good one.

3205
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:47,240
You too.

3206
02:45:47,240 --> 02:45:48,240
Bye.

3207
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:49,240
I don't remember Dekeman calling in before.

3208
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:52,140
Maybe once a long time ago, but I know he's been in the chat room a lot for our program,

3209
02:45:52,140 --> 02:45:53,560
so that's good to hear from him.

3210
02:45:53,560 --> 02:45:54,560
All right.

3211
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:55,560
We're going to shut the Skype line down.

3212
02:45:55,560 --> 02:45:56,560
Sorry, folks.

3213
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:58,440
We're going to start to wrap up the show here, but I want to make sure we got all our last

3214
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:03,120
minute stories out of the way.

3215
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:04,120
That's all I have.

3216
02:46:04,120 --> 02:46:05,120
Huh?

3217
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:06,120
Dark Sakura?

3218
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:08,720
My last minute story is I like pie.

3219
02:46:08,720 --> 02:46:10,320
That's not a story.

3220
02:46:10,320 --> 02:46:11,320
Wait.

3221
02:46:11,320 --> 02:46:12,320
I do have one more.

3222
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:17,000
Remember I talked about last week the Wii ISO loader that got leaked out, and then the

3223
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:23,440
guy making it when it, oh, looks like a wheny cocoa or something like that, wheny cocoa.

3224
02:46:23,440 --> 02:46:29,320
You know, basically he was pissed off about the leak or something like that, and so he's

3225
02:46:29,320 --> 02:46:34,880
like, well, you know, I'm not going to work on it anymore, and then later on the week,

3226
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:36,920
well, maybe I'll work on some more.

3227
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:38,920
Well, I missed the attention, so.

3228
02:46:38,920 --> 02:46:43,160
Yeah, maybe I'll finish it now, so.

3229
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:46,120
So yeah, ISO loader may be coming at some point.

3230
02:46:46,120 --> 02:46:51,280
Okay, well, if there's no other last minute stories, then we're going to go ahead and

3231
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:54,840
go around and get everybody's final thought and try to wrap up tonight's show.

3232
02:46:54,840 --> 02:46:55,840
We'll start off with Tiara.

3233
02:46:55,840 --> 02:46:57,400
Thanks so much for joining us here tonight.

3234
02:46:57,400 --> 02:47:02,080
I hope you had fun, and do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

3235
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:03,080
No.

3236
02:47:03,080 --> 02:47:04,080
No.

3237
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:06,080
Just a simple no.

3238
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:08,720
We'll have a safe flight back to Las Vegas and come see us again.

3239
02:47:08,720 --> 02:47:09,720
I definitely will.

3240
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:10,720
Thank you.

3241
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:11,720
Awesome.

3242
02:47:11,720 --> 02:47:12,720
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3243
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:17,600
My final thought is I went this weekend and played Airsoft, and it was fun, so my gun

3244
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:22,720
I have, the P90 or whatever, I have these 300 round clips, and I hated having to run

3245
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:29,360
out of ammo and change clips and stuff, it's just so inconvenient, so I bought a 1500 round

3246
02:47:29,360 --> 02:47:31,320
box magazine for it now.

3247
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:33,200
I will never run out of ammo.

3248
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:34,200
Ever.

3249
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:35,200
Goody goody.

3250
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:37,400
Just don't bring that to the studio.

3251
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:39,960
I will bring it to the studio one of these days.

3252
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:40,960
No.

3253
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:45,080
I'm just gonna get shot, especially if another dance hero, which I'm surprised, did not come

3254
02:47:45,080 --> 02:47:49,740
up on Skype tonight, the dance hero thing, maybe next week, maybe we'll get some emails.

3255
02:47:49,740 --> 02:47:55,280
My final thought would be I had a bite of John's Chinese food and it was really good.

3256
02:47:55,280 --> 02:48:01,160
It was really good, because I haven't had deep fried chicken in a long time.

3257
02:48:01,160 --> 02:48:04,720
And a nice little humanized Mega Man picture there that Dark Soccer is showing me.

3258
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:06,480
This is gonna be my final thought when...

3259
02:48:06,480 --> 02:48:07,480
Oh, what?

3260
02:48:07,480 --> 02:48:08,920
Okay, then what is your final thought?

3261
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:11,880
Someone needs to go look at Masao's artwork.

3262
02:48:11,880 --> 02:48:24,560
It's at www.5c.biglobe.ne.jp slash tilde kure kure kure kure slash index.htm.

3263
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:25,800
You are gonna post that in chat, right?

3264
02:48:25,800 --> 02:48:26,800
I am.

3265
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:27,800
That's a long ass link.

3266
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:33,280
It's basically this guy that does weird video game art and kind of scary Ronald McDonald

3267
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:37,760
art, but he does Mario and Luigi.

3268
02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:39,720
I'm interested in the scary Ronald McDonald art.

3269
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:40,720
Me too, I might have to look at this.

3270
02:48:40,720 --> 02:48:42,720
But the artist is Masao, M-A-S-A-O.

3271
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:43,720
Alright.

3272
02:48:43,720 --> 02:48:45,720
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

3273
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:48,520
Well if you didn't have a pen and paper to write down that link fast enough, and sadly

3274
02:48:48,520 --> 02:48:51,640
you weren't in chat tonight, you should come join us for a live show sometime.

3275
02:48:51,640 --> 02:48:56,120

Just so many ways for you guys to have a voice here on Orange Launch Radio.

3282
02:49:12,680 --> 02:49:15,920
Please if you like what you've heard tonight, please tell two friends about our show because

3283
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:18,160
word of mouth is really how we get the word out.

3284
02:49:18,160 --> 02:49:21,920
If you can't tell two friends about the show, or even if you can, leave us a nice review

3285
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:24,000
on iTunes, and I want to say another thank you.

3286
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:27,680
We got some more great reviews on iTunes this week and that's very nice and every little

3287
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:33,680
bit helps and makes us rank to that much better on iTunes and helps the visibility of the

3288
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:34,680
program.

3289
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:36,800
It really, really does help, so thank you guys who have been leaving the nice comments

3290
02:49:36,800 --> 02:49:38,480
this week on iTunes.

3291
02:49:38,480 --> 02:49:39,480
You're great!

3292
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:41,640
Alright, that's going to wrap it up.
