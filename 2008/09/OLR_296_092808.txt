Tonight, September 28, 2008, a Banjo-Kazooie remake gets dated, Dance Hero gets trademarked, and an old friend of ours gets the boot.
Hello everybody out there on the internet.
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast on the internet where every gamer has a voice.
Because every week we talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
And we invite you to come be a part of our program.
You can join us in chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
You can talk to us by phone later.
Send us an email.
However you want to do it.
You guys are going to help steer the show tonight.
But we'll be here.
Leading you through the next few hours where we talk about the latest and greatest video gaming.
My name is Rob Roberts.
Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
How are you doing?
I'm okay.
Your voice sounds a little better this week.
It is.
All right.
Good to hear.
Also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
Hi.
How you doing?
Good.
You have a stack of cheese.
I don't know if the Justin TV users can see this or they can't because it's hidden behind your laptop here.
He has a stack of cheeseburgers.
It's only two.
Because, I mean, McDonald's cheeseburgers are like micro cheeseburgers.
But I'm laughing because he literally has a stack of cheeseburgers.
As we'll get into it a little bit later in the program, I can't put them on the floor because there's acts of nature attack.
There's like here in the studio, which we have a real high-tech studio.
It's basically a converted garage.
We have ants or something that live under the floor.
So the funny thing is if you put food on the ground, the ants will rise up from underneath and just storm the food is what Loki found out last week.
Exactly.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I thought it was a fluke.
I was like, ants in the garage?
There's no ants in the garage.
Ants in my garage?
All right.
Anyhow, let's also say hello to a special guest we have tonight.
And it's not very often that we have a fourth person joining us in the studio anymore.
What happened to the locals?
Locals don't love us anymore.
They found women.
I guess so.
Well, so we had to bring a woman on our show.
And we had to bring a non-local woman on our show.
But we love her.
Her name is Tiara, all the way from Las Vegas.
Say hello.
Hi.
How are you?
Not too bad.
All right.
How was the flight?
Good?
The flight was really good.
They messed up my ticket.
The terminals were down for the automatic ticket printing instead of having to go to the flight attendant type people.
Right.
And so I got upgraded to first class for $20.
Nice.
Yeah.
Did you see anyone famous in first class?
No, just a bunch of old people.
Famous old people.
Awesome.
All right, well, welcome to the show tonight.
And, of course, the other reason why Tiara was here, she didn't come to join us just for Orange Lounge Radio, although, you know, that would be nice.
No, I came for Journey.
Yes, part of the reason Tiara came so we could go see Journey and Heart and Cheap Trick.
And if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks, you know, we don't talk about games.
We talk about our personal lives.
We love Journey.
And if you're Jamie, we love Heart.
And for me, you love both, honestly.
You really do.
And Cheap Trick.
Heart is great.
Cheap Trick, they're okay, although they're a bunch of divas because I met them years ago.
But anyway, Heart and Journey are great.
Now, here's the sad news is that we went to the concert, right?
As a lot of folks have been listening to us weeks and weeks, we talk about this.
We finally went to the concert.
What should have been a 40-minute drive up to Marysville took us two and a half hours.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura
We played some rock band over the weekend.
And Dan downloaded Mega Man 9, which was really, really, really cool.
I mean, I was totally just in old school heaven watching a lot of the stuff.
And of course I played a little Ragnarok as usual.
And that's really, really about it for my gaming week.
Awesome.
You know, one thing I love about Mega Man 9... I was busy dealing with other things.
Oh, sure.
I wasn't able to get Mega Man 9 this week because I have my little thing going on with the Wii where I'm not downloading anything else on the Wii.
And I don't have a PlayStation 3 yet, although I'm thinking next week's the week.
And then Xbox 360.
I don't know.
I just can't imagine playing a classic video game on that Xbox 360 controller because that D-pad kind of sucks.
So I think I'm going to have to get it on PlayStation 3 if nothing else.
So...
hopefully soon, but I love listening to the soundtrack.
It's perfect for an old school Mega Man game.
You can even use flicker to your advantage.
Nice.
Like if you get hit and you're going through a tough spot, you just get hit once so that you flicker enough to get through the hard stuff.
Nice.
So maybe there's a reason not to turn it off.
It's old school Mega Man, that's all I can say.
Alright.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was alright.
Um,
I played a bit of Mercenaries, Mercenaries 2, and actually this week I finally got to try the co-op online and it's pretty fun actually.
I was playing with my friend Sean who just picked up the game and I swear to God this game gets even more glitchier the longer I play it.
It's awesome though, I like that.
Did Loki just say more glitchier?
I think he did.
Yes, more glitchier.
Seriously, more glitchier.
I could say it gets even glitchier, but no, it's more glitchier.
That's a technical term.
You're the most smartest host I've ever met.
I am the most smartest.
Smarterest.
Can we get that in an iTunes review, please?
Most smarterest.
The show is great, but it could be more glitchier.
More glitchier, yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It was a brand new helicopter, too.
The guy had just dropped it off for me, got in the helicopter, propeller would not spin.
I was like, well, this is useless.
Maybe you were just too fat for the copter.
No.
Hey, remember, this is my in-game persona, not real life.
Okay, my bad.
Then, of course, more Grand Theft Auto 4.
Did you just have maybe too much baggage in the back?
Because I think that's what happened to Aaliyah.
Well, I was carrying around this guy from United Petroleum, the fake oil company in the game.
Oh, okay.
But yeah, the game is just horribly glitched out, which is awesome.
Anyways, on to other things.
I played a game, a Flash game actually, called, I want to say it was Me and My Dad.
It's by the same people that do Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers.
And it's basically you're this...
I don't know, it's like some sort of demon kid who goes around beating up other kids.
Just like most of the people in the game are completely harmless, and just running around, you just brutally beat them to death.
It's awesome.
This sounds like a Loki dream game.
It's awesome.
So I played that a little bit, and let's see.
Also...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I don't know.
I never saw the guy's dad at any point in this... Well, actually, the title screen did have a larger version of the main character, who I guess was his dad, but I don't understand what Mia... Maybe it's like a twist ending.
Maybe, I don't know, but maybe your dad joins you later and you can beat more people up.
I don't know, but it's... Yeah, that's what it was called, at least.
They had a link on Destructoid for it, so if you want to check it out, just kind of browse back a few pages.
But, um...
T-ara, do you have anything you want to share with your gaming week?
What types of games have you been playing?
Well, I haven't really had a chance to play a lot of games recently since I just started with school again.
But I did play Ragnarok with Jamie, and we played rock band, and we made Dan download Jimmy Buffett so that I could sing Margaritaville.
Nice.
So you were the singer?
Sometimes.
Let me guess, Jamie's bass player?
Actually, I did play a bit of bass, but I also made Dan get Skullcrusher Mountain.
Very cool.
Alright, that's pretty much it then?
Rock Band and learning?
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
And then Final Fantasy Tactics and Joan of Arc on the PSP.
I don't know much about Joan of Arc.
What's this game?
It's basically a tactics game, like Final Fantasy Tactics, except for it stars Joan of Arc, and it takes the whole history of what happened during the time when she was around, and turns it into this thing where magical demons are attacking, and you have to defeat them to save France.
Interesting.
Based on a true story.
Yeah.
They took some creative liberties, I think, but okay.
Yeah, just a few.
Very cool.
But is it fun?
That's the question.
Well, if you like tactics games, then yes, it's fun.
And I think it's kind of smart, even though they replaced all the people that were invading France and everything with quote-unquote demons.
It's still like if a kid played it, they might learn some history out of it.
Because a lot of it is based on actual fact, but then you've got the weird stuff.
Except for the demons and the magic.
Very nice.
All right, cool.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Then World of Warcraft, of course.
And I guess the only new thing I really checked out this week was Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live Marketplace.
How could I forget playing that?
What did you think, Loki?
Oh, it's awesome.
It's exactly how I remembered it.
It is, except I was kind of surprised that, well, I'm not.
I mean, it's basically like the Doom port where they didn't really redo anything.
You know what I mean?
But it does bring back a lot of great memories because, man, I played a lot of Duke Nukem 3D when I was in college.
I kind of wish they had it, but I understand why they didn't have it.
I wish they had the build editor in there to make your own levels.
That'd be awesome.
It's too bad that you can't do some type of... Or the other thing I'm disappointed in is there's no Atomic Edition in there as well, either.
They had a few added weapons and the brand new levels, including the one that parodied Disneyland.
I'm disappointed that wasn't in there.
Maybe it's a download pack later.
Who knows?
Download content.
Who knows?
But it's a very faithful port.
And if you've never played Duke Nukem 3D, at least check out the demo.
I think
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I've had to pull out of E4ALL, which kind of stinks, but I am not going to be attending E4ALL this weekend after all, and I really apologize to those listeners that were planning on going.
Please still continue to go to the All Games booth, which is being co-run by the Championship Gaming Series.
It's going to be pretty cool.
They're going to have some old school gaming celebrities there, and I think that's kind of like one of the themes they're going with is old school, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun, and I'm really sad I can't go, but
Don't worry, it's gallbladder.
It's a very common...
I'll be fine.
So, that's that.
and at about, most of them have been three hours apiece.
I mean, some were two, some were three.
So let's say you said like two and a half hours for each one.
That's still like what?
750 hours at least of content we've done over the years.
That's like a million bajillion hours.
Yes.
Of content.
Tons.
All right.
All right, anyway, let's move on.
Gaming news.
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
Well, there's a Nintendo 64 game that's quite a classic that I never played, but looks interesting nonetheless.
Banjo-Kazooie.
We knew this was coming, the sort of remake or update to it.
And it is coming now exclusively to the Xbox Live Arcade on November 26th, and it will be running you 1,200 Microsoft points.
Banjo-Tooie early 2009
So that's pretty cool.
One other unique thing about this as well, there will be a stop and swap mode.
And what that's exactly going to do is progress that's made in the Xbox Live Arcade game will unlock things in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.
So that's kind of cool.
That's an interesting little crossover, but just kind of a ploy to get people to spend their money twice, right?
Yeah.
Castle Crashers, right?
New character if you have them both?
Yeah.
It's too childish for me now.
DarkSakura,
Real estate is too packed right now.
I have too many games I have to play in a short amount of time.
Saints Row 2 is going to be coming out and I won't give a shit about this game when Saints Row 2 comes out.
Kiki Nico in chat says, Rob, it's one of the best on Nintendo 64.
I understand.
I realize that.
It's just I never got around to it.
Do either of you ladies have an opinion on Banjo-Kazooie?
I never liked it.
Why, same theme?
Too childish, or?
Well, no, I mean, this is also coming from the person who just, what, a couple years ago was ranting and raving about Magic Pen Gel?
Dude, Magic Pen Gel is fucking awesome.
I still say they need another one.
With the penis monster that squirts?
Wow, we're so mature.
But I just never cared for how the game plays.
That's just me.
I never liked the sort of... It was like it would be more fun if it was actually side, but it was that behind view that just didn't seem very fun to me.
Wow, interesting.
I mean, I don't really have a hate or like opinion on it.
I just flat out never really played it.
Interesting, though, that overall in studio here were negative.
But to balance this out, there's positive in chat.
Frisbee says Banjo-Kazooie equals heart.
Kikaniko says they're not liking this BK Bashcast.
I'm not bashing the game, it's just like, I don't want to play it.
It just doesn't look like something I would enjoy.
Here's a question I'll ask you though, is that, you know, one place that Microsoft's really been struggling is appealing to the family demographic.
They've always kind of been the hardcore gaming system.
This is a lot better than Rocky and Bullwinkle, or the fucking crappy Spongebob game that they had on there.
Or, wasn't there like a Shrek game on there too?
Either way, those all sucked.
I'd rather have, like, you know, you're going to have kids playing an Xbox Live or a K-Game?
Perfect.
Perfect.
Perfect for them.
Alright.
Don't let them play that crappy, like, Spongebob crap.
That Rocky and Bullwinkle game was very disappointing.
You know, if you love Rocky and Bullwinkle, too, it just pains you to look at that game.
It's just that it may have been good in, like, the 80s or earlier.
I mean, it's just now, it's like they tried to bring back, what was that, the, um, what was the race game?
Wacky Racist.
Wacky Races is great.
Yeah, Wacky Races is great for the people that remember it.
Kids do not know what the fuck Wacky Races is.
I don't even think I know what Wacky Races is.
I barely know what Wacky Races is.
Wacky Races was also in the same tone as the Laugh Olympics.
Remember that?
No.
All the Hanna-Barbera characters in big competitions, only Wacky Races was... Oh, okay.
Yes, I remember now.
Okay.
I personally preferred the Laugh Olympics.
It's kind of like the Justice League of these types of cartoons, right?
But it was all Hanna-Barbera, so you had the great grape ape and hair bears.
And Huckleberry Hound and all those people were doing battle with the Flintstones.
I love Hanna-Barbera.
Now I remember.
See, that wasn't in this one.
At least this game did not have the Flintstones or anything.
I don't know.
The licensing fee for a game like that would be nuts.
DarkTetsuya says there should be a LaughOlympics video game.
That might be cool.
But the licensing fee would be atrocious, I would think.
Well, it's all Hanna-Barbera, so I would think that LaughOlympics would probably be a lot better than Wacky Races.
Wacky Races sucked, so...
All right, that's that.
I guess to make sure you're not burning a copy of the game or something?
I don't know.
It doesn't work very well.
If I didn't want to play Spore Online, I could easily crack that stupid code with one little patch.
Unfortunately, I've already installed it on my system.
Not that it really matters.
I'm not playing the game anyway.
Well, a class action lawsuit has been filed against Electronic Arts this week over that DRM and specifically kind of targeting Securom.
This class action lawsuit is claiming that Spore contains, quote, a second undisclosed program called Securom, a form of digital rights management for computer games.
Consumers are not warned about the program.
The program installs without any notice and they cannot uninstall the program either.
The program is, quote, secretly installed at the command and control center of the computer, ring zero, or the kernel, and surreptitiously operated, overseeing function and operation on the computer, preventing the computer from operating under certain circumstances and or disrupting hardware operations.
So it was a class action lawsuit filed against Electronics Arts, who's put this game out there, basically saying, you are installing a second program without my consent on my computer.
That's basically the core of it.
And I agree with that.
I agree that that makes sense because they aren't saying, hey, we're installing this on here or giving you a way to uninstall it, say, if you uninstall the game.
It stays on your computer.
Forever.
What do you guys think?
What will become of this lawsuit?
And I posed this question in our chat room as well.
Do you think this lawsuit has any merit?
Is this a sue-happy America?
What's going to happen, you think?
Settlement?
Any thoughts?
Honestly, I think that they're going to have to settle, at least just to get people to shut up.
But other companies have been doing this for ages.
For example, I think Dell does the DNA program, I think, to see if you're... God, I can't remember what exactly it's about, but they install a program.
But then again, I guess if you buy a Dell, you know you're eventually going to get this on there.
But there should have... What?
I was just going to say that probably they're not going to end up getting any money out of this.
It's probably just going to be agreeing that... I think this has happened in the past with other games that had Secure ROM where the agreement was that there is an uninstall program but you have to get it from Secure ROM to uninstall the game.
But they keep changing the version so it doesn't work, I don't think, anymore.
I know it's not easy to uninstall it.
I think that there should have been something in the manual.
Or maybe just like a little icon on the box that has some sort of Securom logo on it or something.
I happen to have the box right here.
Dude, I'm sorry, I just have to interrupt with something hilarious.
Please, that's why you're here.
I was just, like, I was reading an article about how You Know Who was disbarred, and somebody made a cake and wrote, Dear You Know Who, congrats on the disbarment, you douchebag.
Hold on, you're getting to the next story.
You're getting a little ahead.
That's alright.
I'm looking at the box, and I'm looking at the inside of the box.
It's a little, you know, what's all in the game.
I'm looking at the back of the box.
I'm even looking at the fine print that gives the system requirements.
Internet connection is required.
EA terms and conditions and feature updates can be found at www.ea.com.
I don't see the word Secure ROM anywhere here on this box.
So they don't tell you.
I honestly, I do honestly think, I mean, you know, the primary rule is let the buyer beware but still, I think that if they are going to install something without your knowledge when you think you're getting a game and all of a sudden you're getting, you know, this other business even though it's to protect their information I honestly think that there should be some sort of warning so that the buyer can be aware and not beware, you know what I mean?
and not have to rely strictly on Amazon reviews.
Exactly.
The other thing, too, I mean, does your copy of Warhammer have SecureM on it?
Because it's also EA.
Who knows?
I don't know.
I mean, I'm looking at the box for Warhammer, which I also happen to have right here, and I don't think I see anything on here either.
But then again, would I?
Probably not.
Although I do notice a lot of the very same blah, blah, blah on here that I saw on the other box.
Yeah.
I don't know, I don't like the idea that... I mean, I don't have a problem with a program that's making sure my copy of the game I'm running is legit.
That's fine.
But the problem is, this program is also supposed to mess up your CD burning software or something like that.
Luckily, it hasn't with mine, because I've been able to burn DVDs quite easy.
Um...
You know, Drew Nami has a good point in our chatroom.
Warhammer doesn't need Securon.
It is impossible to play... Well, I mean, I guess never say never.
But virtually impossible to play this game without buying your own copy.
Because it being an MMO, you have to have a key to go online and play the game.
And it needs an internet connection by nature.
So it's very easily verifiable.
It doesn't matter.
It's a game.
It's a copy.
I mean...
They do that with Final Fantasy XI.
You have to have a copy, you know, a content code or something like that to prove that you bought, you know, the game, so...
TigerClaw asks, did the end user license agreement state anything about copy protection?
It may not mention about secure ROM.
TigerClaw said it did not.
Interesting.
Even if it did, I think they might have a claim that it's not visible enough.
How many people really read those end user license agreements?
I don't know.
Who knows?
Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy before us here on All Games Radio, says the Galactic Edition box also does not state secure ROM.
He has the Special Edition.
Um...
Let's see.
Frisbee says people actually checked the end-user license agreement and never saw Secure ROM.
Frisbee had another really good point here earlier.
I'm trying to find it.
You have to tell people when you install stuff in a PC it's an invasion of piracy.
TigerClaw also says this.
I hope this lawsuit goes through because digital rights management is bad enough as it is.
I wonder, though, when you install the game, there's probably an end-user... That's where that second discussion went on.
It's spyware.
It's a spyware or a trojan, basically, because it's a program that's being installed without you knowing.
And that is just not right.
Do you remember years ago when CDs, I believe it was Sony?
Yeah, the Sony Rootkit.
That's it.
Rootkit was what it was called.
There was a big stink over that, and they had to end up...
either replacing discs or something well they had to put an uninstalled program out there for this and people found out you could get around this by drawing a line with a sharpie pen on your disc to basically fuck up the data track on your CD because data tracks go at the end it's a little different I guess but here's the crazy thing about that I was actually reading about Rootkit on Wikipedia not that long ago did you know that not only could you go to the website to get the program
The Windows official... You know how Windows has their own spyware removal program or whatever that comes out every month?
Like sometimes you see it in Windows Update.
The rootkit removal ended up being a part of that months later.
So I just always thought that was kind of fascinating.
So, very interesting.
And yeah, GameGuru says it's a rootkit and no one warned it.
I'm wondering if this isn't going to go along the same route.
To me, that rootkit thing kind of set a precedent in this regard.
That's where I think that, yeah, this might be justified because you're installing extra shit that someone didn't ask for.
Well, if they're going to follow by previous... Because I do believe that, isn't it, once it hits the federal level, if it's gone through court, what, at least three times that...
It becomes a basically... Oh, God, I can't remember.
I took that law class a long time ago.
I'll get what you're saying, though.
But usually, if there's been a precedent set for it, they tend to stick by previous rulings.
All right.
Well, if you have some thoughts on this, you can join us in our chat room, or you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
And we'll let Rob read it.
Alright, let's move on with the news.
I know Tiara gave us a hint of what's to come, but please, DarkSakura, give us the wonderful, glorious news that happened this week.
In baking news, there's been cakes made regarding... No.
Well, as stated by Sauce earlier, we have no more of he who shall not be named practicing law.
He has been permanently disbarred and he's already throwing a hissy fit and going...
Over the whole thing.
He's basically saying that it's a retaliation for a book he wrote about the Florida Supreme Court trying to...
Get past this faith-based activism against the American entertainment industry.
He's quoted saying this rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit.
With enemies this foolish Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has.
That's his statement.
Actdeft in chat is suggesting that we shall change the name from He Who Shall Not Be Named to He Who Shall Not Practice Law.
I endorse this.
I endorse it as well.
Loki?
I'm fine with that.
I just hope we don't have to talk to him anymore.
He Who Shall Not Practice Law.
I know, it is getting a little old, isn't it?
Yeah, it's already been.
It was a little old a long time ago.
Just though, and this is what I was saying when Bobby made his call to us earlier, is, I mean, keep in mind, this is the same guy who went after Two Life Crew back in the day, went after Ice-T for his cop killer thing, and basically, as far as I'm concerned, this man is anti-First Amendment.
You know what he needs to refocus his efforts on?
Like reality TV shows that appear on MTV, like The Real World and The Hills.
Those need to be taken off TV.
Even more though, going back to what I was trying to say about, I don't think he's specifically anti-First Amendment.
He's pro-First Amendment as long as it's whatever he wants to say.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm actually, like I was saying earlier, I think this is a long time coming ever since, you know, the late 80s.
God, what is this now?
20 years this has been coming?
I'm finally glad to see, you know, basically the duct tape thrown over his mouth and, you know, hopefully he'll stop bitching and realize that no one really cares.
Maybe he'll take up knitting.
Huh?
We'll see.
I said maybe he'll take up knitting.
We'll see.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
including this guy.
I suppose this is the biggest defense ever, huh?
It's like, the Florida people don't like me because I wrote a mean book about them.
No, they disbarred you because you're a big fucking moron.
The end.
Thank you for watching!
Hopefully we'll never have a story about this guy again, for real real.
One more time, the FUs of the week.
As inspired by a story about this guy.
I have a multiple part FU, and it begins with a certain event that occurred on Tuesday.
On Tuesday I was driving school, minding my own, and paying attention to the road, and then CRASH.
The Silver Lancer of Love is now the totaled out Silver Lancer of Death.
It is gone RIP Lancer.
My baby.
My poor, poor baby.
Yeah, and I did actually end up hurting my hip kind of bad.
I've been kind of limping about, but I'm going to see my chiropractor next week, which is Poppy.
And then as my week progresses, Dan ends up going into the hospital for, I had to spend like, what, three, four hours in the ER with Dan, with his knee being sprained.
So, it was just sort of one thing after another, but everything was happy when I went to the airport and picked us up.
It's been great.
Except for this morning when I had to spend four hours at the car dealership signing papers.
And it was the signing papers part that took longer than the test driving part.
However, I now have a happy Toyota vibe, as in Matrix with the Pontiac exterior.
Now, the big question is, what are you going to name it?
Because your last car was Vic Viper, right?
Well, my last car was Vic Viper, and the one before that was the Twindy.
So what's this one going to be now?
Whatever the ship and R-Type is.
Dan suggested that it should be Raider.
That way she would have a Pontiac vibe Raider.
I get it.
Maybe that'll be its secret.
It's not Lord British because it's not red.
Dan pointed that out to me because I was going to name it Lord British.
Nice.
If you named it Ribbon, it would be one letter away from Vibribbon.
Vibribbon?
Actdeft's Contributed Tonight
That's two pretty big deals there.
Add it on the wiki, my car has a name.
Alright, there you go.
Loki, your FU of the week.
My FU of the week goes to your aunt.
And, um, they're annoying.
Hey, what did my aunt do to you?
She's sitting in a house in the middle of Elk Grove somewhere, just tending to the pigs.
Hey, well that aunt's fine, but the other hunter that you have underneath this floor here, that kind of sucked.
I put the food, or I should say the trash, next to the mixing board, so if the sound starts to go out and we notice a big horde of ants, we'll know why.
All right.
My FU of the week goes to my gallbladder.
Because it sucks!
And it's like, I don't like you, Rob.
I'm going to get all inflamy and stuff inside you.
And you're going to have to have a surgery to take me out.
Thankfully, gallbladder surgery is no big deal.
I've had plenty of people reassure me it's...
Not a big deal.
It's just, you know, just the method of it all and having to get all the pre-screenings and having to go through it.
I'm going to be in bed for two weeks, which is going to suck because I won't be able to do the show, among other things.
But I should be able to get a whole lot of DS playing in at that time because, you know, I haven't reviewed a DS game on this program in like six months.
So that's going to be the blessing about gallbladder surgery is, damn it, I'm going to catch up on every single handheld game I've been waiting to catch up on in a long freaking time.
So F you to the gallbladder for hating me.
Sadly enough, Rob's gallbladder is easier to remove than secure, Rob.
You've been sitting here all night long with that punchline, haven't you?
Nope, just last minute.
Asshole.
Tiara, do you have any F yous of the week?
I would just like to say to Drew that you suck for not coming to my brunch yesterday.
So F you, Drew, for ruining my vacation by being a loser and not showing up.
Aww.
How sad.
Alright.
There you go.
Happy use of the week.
Nate432 says, Rob, you need to give the PSP some more love.
I do love the PSP, and you know I'm going to love it a whole lot more when it's the only way I can watch movies for a couple weeks.
So, hey, PSP is the perfect post-surgery device.
There you go.
How's that?
You get your movies, your music, and your games all in one.
There's your PSP love.
All right.
Securom is the new gator, says Jurnami.
Remember Gator?
Yeah, I remember Gator.
Good stuff.
Gator sucked.
Gator doesn't.
Whatever happened to Gator?
It's probably still around.
I'm going to look that up on Wikipedia right now.
All right.
Meanwhile, another story.
Meanwhile, tomorrow or today or whenever you're having a listen to this, Monday.
September 29th, Xbox Live Arcade will be... Or Xbox Live completely will be down the entire day.
24 hours so that they can do some necessary improvements to prep for the next Xbox experience.
Or new Xbox experience.
You know, with all the fancy avatars and...
Other crap that they're adding to it.
So that's not the day that it's coming out, but it will be the day that they're working on stuff.
You'll have to find some offline games to play during that time.
Wow.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Try to give you some dumb little program that would sneak Gator on there as part of it.
Well, yeah, that was it.
It was weather scope, precision time.
That was it.
Is the time on your computer accurate?
That was their big thing.
Well, here's the thing.
There was this all back and forth stuff.
In 2006, Claria said they were going to exit the adware business and focus on search technology.
Well, here's the thing.
September 26, 2008, two days ago,
Jelly Cloud, which is what Claria changed its name to in June, has laid off all its employees, shut down all operations, and has liquidated all assets.
So Gator officially bid it this week.
How do you like that for late-breaking news?
And I would have never known if we didn't joke about it on tonight's show.
So Xbox Live down for a full day, really?
Yeah, I had to make the preparations last week so we're ready to go back to playing System Link Saints Row 1.
That's what we're going to do on Monday.
I have to go a full day without Rock Band?
What am I going to do?
I'm just kidding.
Is Xbox Live going down a whole day really that big a deal?
I don't think so.
It won't be the end of the world.
It is a big deal if you happen to, I don't know, have a new system that requires you to be logged into Xbox Live so that it knows that you purchased certain things.
Otherwise they show up as demos or just don't work.
Oh yeah, that'll be bad for those folks that haven't done the resetting of their licenses and all that stuff.
Yeah, let's play more Mercenaries 2.
and Watch Heroes.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura.com
Well, here's a thought.
If they had never teased this as being an element of the game, I... It would have looked really awesome.
It would have looked really awesome when it finally came out.
So in a way, I think the lesson to be learned here is don't tempt us with things that you're not going to be able to because this is the kind of stories that are going to happen.
You know?
Otherwise, people would have been none the wiser.
I bet you there still would have been a lot of anticipation over Fable 2 because, you know, Fable did have its fans on Xbox One.
You know?
So...
Just kind of a lesson to be learned, I suppose.
But still, at least they are patching it that soon.
At least it's not coming like a year later.
We hope.
This is in theory.
Yeah.
But, I mean, there are a lot of games that are put out by certain companies like EA that come out flawed and patches don't come that quick at all.
And I find it hard to believe that, oops, we just didn't catch some of these bugs.
Mercenaries 2.
It's just...
The Romantic
Take a villager on a perfect date or tag along to one.
Meaning that it looks like most achievements will be obtainable in co-op modes as well.
Which is kind of interesting because is that part of the programming where I guess once the trigger's hit, it's hit no matter who did it?
Or was that something that was always intended to try and get more people to play the game together or whatever?
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Quick comments from chat room.
There's quite a few comments coming in here.
Bobby Blackwolf says, I've never heard of a movie being taken out of the theaters to be given a new ending and put back in theaters.
Wait, wait, wait.
I have, I have.
28 days later.
Remember?
They re-released it with like the additional ending or the special ending?
Yeah.
Sometimes they do, I mean, you know, I get the point.
I think he's trying to say that you're doing an apples and oranges thing with that comparison.
But they do sometimes re-release movies with extra crap to try and get people to go see it a second time.
Or completely change it all around.
Thank you, George Lucas.
But...
I guess that's true.
Let's see.
Gerardabo says, but are people really not going to play Fable 2 because there's no co-op in it?
I think not.
It's still Fable.
I think at the end of the day, he's right.
You're right.
Anybody that was going to buy the game is still going to buy it because they know it is coming.
And anybody that wasn't going to buy the game is just going to throw this onto the list of what they don't like.
At least they came out and said that the online co-op isn't in there instead of releasing it with the online co-op and it doesn't work.
And then go, oops, we've got to patch it later.
True.
Very true.
So, you know, honestly, at the end of the day, is this going to change anything about Fable 2?
Probably not.
Probably not.
But, will this maybe set a really bad precedent?
That's what we're all kind of... Wait, I don't think so.
The precedent's already been set a long time ago.
I mean, now that we have consoles that can patch games, that doesn't mean that the game has to come out perfect.
And not that it really mattered before that either.
I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of the games that came out before the 360 and stuff like that, there weren't as many glitches and problems because they spent more time testing them and making sure that they worked right.
Now it doesn't matter because if people discover glitches later on, we'll just go and fix it.
I think that's kind of lazy.
It kind of sucks that you buy a product and it doesn't work correctly.
because of sheer laziness.
Sounds like there will be a lot of people that want to call in and talk about this later.
We've got to keep it moving though.
We're getting into the show here and we've got a lot of stories to still cover like whatever DarkSakura is going to talk about next.
Well, it looks like, you know how people were saying that the 360 wasn't necessarily so popular in Japan, but it looks like it overtook the PS3, actually, again.
With the recent price cut, it went down, it actually managed to get out 13,777 units, as opposed to PS3's 8,156.
So, it's seriously giving it the smackdown.
However, in software titles, it's still basically in Nintendo's pocket.
For software, Pokemon Platinum is the top seller, then Dragon Ball Origins, Rhythm Tengoku Gold, and the top three are all DS games, followed by Trusty Bell, Chopin's Dream on PS3, the reprise.
So Microsoft really needs to be, like, praising, you know, whatever deity they believe in for Tales of Vesperia right about now, right?
Pretty much.
I mean, well, following down even the next two games after, that are more Nintendo games.
Quiz Magic Academy DS and Wii Fit are five and six, respectively.
Seven is a Katakyo Hitman Reborn Battle Arena on PSP.
Eighth is Wiz Samurai Portable PSP.
Nine, One Piece Unlimited Cruise on Wii and then Mario Kart Wii.
So it's very much dominated by Nintendo.
But as far as hardware sales, number one is the DS, two is the Wii, three is PSP, four Xbox 360, five PS3, and six PS2.
Which is actually still impressive, selling over 7,000 units.
Interesting comment from chat, and I apologize in advance for horribly mispronouncing your name, which I'm sure I'm going to do.
Hephaestus says, I love the fact that 360 outselling PS3 in Japan for a week is news.
It kind of is, in a way.
I mean, it really is that, wow, the 360, because a lot of folks say, oh, Xbox is failing in Japan, Microsoft is failing, they don't know what they're doing, da-da-da, or that it's never going to sell in Japan, and then finally it takes one really, really good game
for that audience to really start moving these systems.
The turnaround is somewhat notable.
The question is, will it have momentum, or is this just going to be a one-trick pony?
Still, though, that's more than twice as many units that went out.
I want to say that
Perhaps if, you know, if it basically, it does have to do with Squeenix support, if I think that they might put the effort into trying to get more of those major party developers, at least for the Japanese market, to try to get more things on their systems, you know, that might help them out in the long run if they can keep that kind of support.
I think they need to throw a lot of money at Capcom to get another Monster Hunter game exclusive for the 360.
That'll sell plenty of systems.
Or Fire Emblem.
Fire Emblem will never be on that system.
I mean, not Fire Emblem.
Because that's a Nintendo title.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I was thinking actually what you were saying.
It's getting the name mixed up.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright, let's move on.
What we got after the countdown was done is a teaser for a Halo 3 campaign expansion.
And we know this because on Xbox Live, the description for the video that's on there is a new Halo 3 campaign experience.
But what exactly this...
Experience will be, who knows.
The thoughts are it's not going to be Master Chief as the main character.
And actually they have a whole bunch of...
Breakdown on the trailer and stuff.
I know on Xbox, was it on 360 Fanboy?
They had a pretty cool video breakdown there.
Obsessive fans analyzing each and every frame.
I know.
Awesome.
And then, of course, along with analyzing every single frame, they thought that they found a date within the movie itself.
And, of course, it was January 6, 2009, which would be a Tuesday.
So this might be possibly coming soon.
In January, I guess we'll have to see, but that's kind of exciting.
At least they're going to be expanding the game some, in case it's gotten a little stale.
Free expansion, hopefully?
I don't think so, but I think this is actually kind of like Shivering Isles or something like that.
Something of that size, because it's a whole new portion of the game.
That's kind of neat to see something like that in a non-RPG type game, though.
Kind of neat to see the extended life of the game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
to be honest I haven't ever I mean I've played Halo 2 a little bit and Halo 1 multiplayer a little bit but I never really actually played through the storylines of those so I couldn't really tell you what the hell that was going on in the trailers but it looked cool and it's um interesting I mean this will probably mean a lot more to a Halo fan so
HALO MMO
They were working on a MMO centered in the Halo universe and apparently even some pictures have surfaced from what the Halo MMO was supposed to look like and it kind of looked like wow in the Halo universe.
It's kind of interesting.
It looked to be kind of simple like World of Warcraft is.
Very similar layout for those that play Warcraft or even Warhammer Online.
Actually the interface almost looks more like Warhammer Online to me.
Kind of the way it is.
You can see characters wheeling dual swords as well as guns and all that stuff.
So
Thanks for watching!
I'm going to miss Ensemble.
Sorry to pour salt in the wound there.
It's very interesting, too.
You don't often hear about what these studios are necessarily working on, the secret projects, when these studios are closed.
So it's kind of neat that we got to hear a little something about it.
Dancing Stage Supernova 2, Playstation 2
FIFA 09 on damn near everything Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations on DS after that
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, the Sonic DS made by BioWare, coming to the DS.
And also, Silent Hill Homecoming, coming to the PC, 360, and PS3 this week.
It's pretty awesome.
Pipe Mania, coming out on Wii, 360, and PC.
I guess it's on the 360, maybe that's an Xbox Live Arcade game.
I haven't heard that one.
Let's see here.
There's a lot of games that are coming out.
DT Carnage on PSP Car Combat Game
PC.
Let's see, we've got a bunch of games coming out.
Some of the highlights though.
Let's see here.
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
Let me read this chat comment really quick because it's funny.
I load for real.
Actdeft says, Silent Hill got a 6.5 by IGN, I think.
It makes a little annoyed face.
And Frisbee says, IGN gets a 6.5 sometimes.
Nice.
Supposedly, I guess on PC, and I thought this already came out already, but it says Limbo of the Lost is coming.
And if you remember that god-awful song they made you guys listen to a little bit ago.
Yeah, that was from that game.
And...
Lastly, let's see here.
Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate for PC.
We Cheer on the Wii.
And let's see here.
Lastly, Harvest Moon, Tree of Tranquility on the Wii.
Goody, more Harvest Moon.
Yay!
All right.
Is that it?
All right.
Let's move over to Japan where it's kind of a slower week.
There's not a whole lot of new stuff coming out, but there is Raiden 4 coming out on the Xbox 360.
So if you like your Raiden games, there's a brand new one.
I didn't even know there was one in development.
There you go.
Coming out on the 360.
Moving over to the PlayStation 3.
Not a lot of new stuff, but you do get some price reductions on Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion and Warhawk are moving into the best series.
As well as, hey, if you need it, a new Dusk Guard filter coming out in black and white.
Dusk Guard Filter 3.
DustGuard Filter 3 on the Nintendo Wii.
GQ Powerful Major League 3 is the only new game coming out this week.
It's a new game from Konami.
It comes out this week on the Nintendo Wii.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Unknown Soldier, Mokuba no Hoku comes out this week in Japan.
As well as Nakamura, Sumiko, Tetai, Shidou, Shin, Twig, Test, One High, One Fun, DS Lesson from the Rocket Company.
I'm trying to figure out what exactly is the lesson that will be learned in this game.
Let's see.
It looks like it might be writing of some sort.
Oh, it's English.
It's English.
Learning English.
DarkSakura.com
Not a whole lot.
Looks like there's about three new games here.
To Love, Rue Trouble, Doki Doki, Rinkai Gakuhen comes out on the PSP, as well as Iki Tosen, Eloquent Fist comes out, regular and limited edition.
To make a correction to the comment in the chatroom that we had, Silent Hill Homecoming hasn't been rated or reviewed by...
IGN yet they do have one press rating which is from and that is a 6.5 that's from the official Xbox magazine so all your hate needs to be directed to the official Xbox magazine at this time IGN you can hate on it a little bit later alright that's it for Japanese release dates well how about more news cause no good news is good good news how about it anyway well um
Hideo Kojima is the hero of many, many a gamer for giving us the Metal Gear franchise.
And he's saying that he's got ideas for Metal Gear Solid 5, three concepts, but he doesn't want anyone to use them because that means he has to get involved and he doesn't want to.
He said he was going to be stepping back out of Metal Gear Solid, the whole series.
But honestly, I think that...
He should have some involvement with it.
It was his story from the beginning.
I don't think that starting a story and leaving it in the hands of other people, especially if you've controlled it so far, it could probably have less of a bizarre ending than Metal Gear Solid 4 had, maybe, but I don't know.
I liked his weird storytelling.
Well, I can tell you what one of his ideas were for the new Metal Gear Solid game, and I'll give you...
A little bit of a vague idea here.
Basically, a couple of Snake's cronies will be coming to visit him.
Unfortunately, when they arrive there, they will figure out that he's dead.
To which they have to convince everyone around him that he's still alive by moving his arms and stuff and hanging out on the beach and that kind of fun stuff.
He's not getting the weekend at Bernie's Treatment.
I thought it was Dead or Alive.
The most dorkest thing I've ever heard.
Okay, here's the thing though.
I mean, it's interesting because he might have actually really meant it this time when he said he wasn't doing another Metal Gear game.
Because doesn't he always say that?
Like, I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
No, I'm not going to do it.
Fine.
Now he's kind of like, this kind of is like, well, I don't really want to do it.
But if, you know, they wanted me to do it, I have an idea.
Yeah.
Well, there was some other type of experimental game that he was working on.
But, I mean, as long as he writes this... Sorry.
I think we need a Solid Snake party game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hefeistus in chat says, it's like, ooh, please beg me to do it and I'll reluctantly agree.
It's kind of what this amounts to.
Nice.
Well, we'll see if he ends up coming back in a larger capacity or if he really means it this time.
I honestly think he really means it, but he's not going to be able to resist contributing in some way.
But he's just going to probably scale back his involvement.
We'll see.
Oh, yeah, the weekend at Bernie's thing.
That's comedy gold, man.
It'll be awesome.
Anyways, there's something out there that you can play for free on your PS3.
That's right.
There is actually an MMO available in Japan called Angel Love Online.
And it is a free-to-play MMO.
And there are instructions online to allow you to set up your own account and basically create your own account.
I guess login.
If you don't have a PlayStation Network login for Japanese PlayStation Network, then you can create one and also help you create a login for this game.
To create your Japanese PlayStation Network login, the easiest way to do that is actually go to a website called JapanesePSN.com and they'll walk you through it.
And as far as creating your own login for this game, you can actually go to PS3Fanboy.com.
They have an article on there for that.
And also...
NeoGAF.com their forums there's another article the game itself actually looks a little bit like Ragnarok online kind of except really like chibi with a bunch of people like are you trying to just get Tiara and Jamie interested in this game
Not really, I mean, but I'm just saying, you know, hey, it's a free-to-play game.
I don't really know what the point of the game is.
There is someone riding a giant beetle, so, I mean, that's kind of cool.
Oh, and there's another giant, like, frog or something.
But lots of people dressed up really weird.
Someone's in a giant cat monster, or cat robot thing.
So, yeah, I'm sure this will appeal to somebody.
I don't know what the point of this game is or purpose, because it's all in Japanese.
So, haha, funny.
But, um...
Yeah, check it out.
It's free.
So, free is awesome.
And if it sucks, hey, you know what?
At least this game looks a little bit better than yours.
Is that going to be your new thing?
Well, at least it's better than yours.
Yes, it is better than yours.
Angel Love Online.
Also better than Yaris are price drops!
Hooray!
And it was rumored that a big ol' price drop is coming for the Sony PlayStation 3, but it looks like it's actually mostly kind of contained to Blockbuster.
It looks like they appear to be unloading some extra consoles there.
This happened on Friday and it was caught from a
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and DarkSakura.
They're going to have to drop the price of those because the new 160 is coming out in like November sometime.
So...
Yeah, and that's not surprising.
But yeah, this is not the price drop you're looking for there, not dropping the system down $200 or anything like that.
It's just clearing them out.
Right, because with all these games you usually have to install on the systems, you probably want to get a bigger hard drive now that we're learning what it's for, and that is installing the games on your drive, basically.
Which reminds me, I need to get a bigger hard drive for the Xbox.
My 20 gig drive is finally starting to fill up to the point where I can't fit much more on it.
and it's because of freaking Rock Band.
I have been kind of clearing out old games and stuff and I just, I have a lot of crap on there.
You know, keep in mind, seven of the 20 gigs gets taken up with that emulation stuff.
So, I think I might finally have to cave and get, you know, a bigger drive.
Let's say, you know, hell freezes over and I want to reinstall Final Fantasy XI on my Xbox someday.
I just wouldn't be able to do it without a bigger hard drive.
We'll see.
Or get a second hard drive.
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
on the 360 yep and movies from $2.99 and up $2.99 and up for the HD movies they were still too expensive and I didn't want yeah you know the $2.99 ones are usually kind of crappy things that aren't even real movies usually those types of things that just show off the power of HD players like you know National Geographic you know Discover the World and stuff which you know you might want to watch once to go ooh and ah but that's about it right so anyway sorry tangent my bad
What is a show without tangents?
Well, here's some good news for all of our Sonic fans, and hopefully it won't be like some of the previous ones, but Yuji Naka is working on something with Prope, which is the new development studio.
They have a website posted that says that it's a new experience that can be played by penguins.
How do penguins play video games?
But it'll be something with Sega.
And I mean, maybe it'll be Sonic.
Maybe it'll be Outrun.
I doubt it's Sonic.
It's got to be something new.
It's a game where he makes snow cones.
Pengo!
Maybe you build igloos.
It'd be fun.
But the site... Frostbite 2008.
I'll link it in the chat room.
But it's got this little flash thingy with a penguin in front of a screen.
It's actually at probe.sega.jp.
Just go look.
Hopefully this means that the game will involve penguins because that'll be cute.
I love penguins.
That's what I'm hoping for.
It looks basically like a blurred out TV, like a widescreen TV in the background.
And then a penguin in front of it with the exclamation point and a question mark and a word bubble.
And it's looking off to the side.
And the penguin doesn't look very confused.
He just looks flappy.
But Rob likes penguins.
I love penguins.
That's why I'm hoping that it's a whole new... I hope it is like a new version of Pango or something.
It means the next Sega game will be released only on Linux.
I somehow doubt that.
I know.
It'll be written in Penguinese.
You cannot understand it right.
You have to pay for the game in fish.
Alright, we'll see in a few more days when they announce it.
Something else that's going to be coming, possibly soon, would be the new Sonic Genesis collections, which is supposed to be coming out on the 360 and PS3, according to some retail listings dug up, and it says each with ship dates of February 2009.
Hmm, what could that be?
Could that actually be coming out?
I don't know, retail listings, I wouldn't have seen that either, would I?
But yeah, so, I don't know, it's probably a collection of all the Sonic games It's supposed to be pretty cheap from what I hear And I'd imagine it probably just has the Sonic Sega Genesis games Don't we already kind of have the Genesis games on Xbox Live Arcade?
Yeah, it's the Sonic Mega Collection or something like that, you know
Thanks for watching!
Frisbee echoes my thoughts exactly.
A Sega compilation.
That's called the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox Ones.
It's like we've seen all this before.
Yeah, but the GameCube and Xbox.
So now we get achievements.
Exactly.
All right.
Well, you know, Sonic is a classic though, despite the fact that they release it over and over and over again.
It still is a classic game.
And we love to pay Classic Games some tribute here on this program.
And that's why every week DarkSakura likes to bring us her classic video game of the week.
So DarkSakura, please go into the Dusty Archives of Gaming and find a game that should be highlighted this week on the program in the Classic Game of the Week segment.
Today's classic game is Mega Man 2.
And I'm saying Mega Man 2 instead of the first one because honestly I think Mega Man 2 was a much better game.
So if you want to roll that beautiful bean footage, Rob.
Mega Man 2
How many of us remember that noise?
This is Metal Man's music.
But basically, it's, you know, it's... Okay, who in our chatroom does not know Mega Man?
Do I have to really explain it?
You're a little blue robot, and you go through all these different stages, fighting off these cute little robotic enemies, and you pick up power-ups on the way, like a big giant Mega Man head.
Also, if you don't know who Mega Man is, he's like Bender from Futurama.
Totally.
At any rate, as you make it through the level, you have to fight a robot master.
Ew, they have whips and chains and... never mind.
At any rate, basically you have to fight these different robots that each have a different ability and their theme of their stage is, you know, goes along with whatever their ability is.
Like, Mega Man shoots out metal blades.
and Bubble Man shoots out bubbles that don't do much except for the very end of the game where there's only three places that you use the weapon at all.
Although there are some robots that if you do it in a certain order, some are weaker to others.
This music here is Quick Man Stage, which is like the single most annoying stage.
Unless you have fantastic timing, it's almost impossible to get past those beans that shoot across.
Use Flashman power.
That's right, use Flashman power.
However, Dan can do it without using Flashman's thing.
That's insane.
I've seen him do it.
I did not believe he could do it until I saw him do it.
And plus you need that Flashman power to beat the boss.
It really helps beating the boss.
Because you can take like a third of his life away instantly if you have all the Flashman power.
Yeah, like I was saying earlier, each of the enemies in the game have a particular weakness to the other bosses' master's powers.
So you can...
Except for like Airman, which you can only really get him with the regular shot and the metal blades work on him too.
I think you're supposed to use Leaf Shield if you have it.
I think.
I might be wrong.
I always just started off with Airman.
I either started off with Metal Man or Airman.
Yeah, I started with Metal Man.
That person just did it, see?
Yeah, you have to have impeccable timing to be able to get past this part though.
You just have to have it memorized.
We'll have to link that one in the chatroom, because I was very... And he even got the power-up, too.
This is the part that always got me.
Yeah.
Oh, no, it was... Yeah, it was this one, sorry.
Anyway, I know this is really great radio, but I...
This is actually one of my all-time favorite games.
It is up there on the list.
I even got so bored one day that I cracked the code by myself just experimenting with it.
The password code where you put in the red blocks and blue blocks wherever to get past whatever and get all of the power-ups and everything.
And I wrote it on a pair of torn up blue jeans.
So I actually had it rolled up like a scroll.
Scroll and everything?
Scroll.
Like a scroll and everything.
It was my special thing to get past that.
The other cool thing about this one is that they actually had to fight to get this one out since the first Mega Man didn't have, well, Rockman, I should say, in Japan, didn't really have that big of a following.
But since they put more work into the game and improved the graphics and the overall play of it, they were able to get this out and since then it's become basically a staple of almost anyone's classic collection.
Of course it spawned so many sequels that we've lost count, including a couple of fighting games, the Power Battles, and a few...
Other, uh, there's even the whole, um, uh, Mega Man EXE series.
You know, we wouldn't have that without this.
Even though I think we'd be better off without it, because I don't really care for it personally.
Um, it also made, um, GameSpot's, uh, greatest games of all time.
It was number 33 in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever list.
Um...
It also had a novelization.
They released a novel of it.
I guess it was only in the U.S., but it was put out by Scholastic like every other dance kid's book in the late 80s and early 90s.
Was that the same guy who did the Blaster Master books and all that stuff?
I... It doesn't say.
Huh.
It doesn't say.
It also had, like, one of the best worst cover arts ever.
You know, because it had him holding the gun and everything and had the visor.
It was just stupid and ugly.
Also, there was a Navi mode in the game.
If you got the Rockman Complete Works discs that came out on PlayStation in 1999 in Japan, which were the NES versions with the tons of bonuses, but also had a sort of, I guess a commentary kind of mode for playing through the game.
It was also included in the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.
It was on PS2 and GameCube and Xbox.
Again, it's one of my favorite games.
And also, this is the game that gave us Rush, remember?
You could get the platform, or the jet, or the other Rush thing that I forget.
What was it, the one that wrote up walls?
Number 3.
Yeah.
And it also had the e-tank, so you could get your full refill system and everything.
And this is the one that I think set the stage for the releases afterwards.
And it's really the one that Mega Man 9 is even modeled after.
Because you don't have the power slide or a lot of that stuff that came even in 3.
You don't see that in 9.
I mean, 9 is in some ways a direct sequel to 2, not to 8.
As far as the way it plays, it does.
But to be technical, there was actually... For 8 and 9, there was a game that came in between.
And I do want to say that it was Mega Man and Bass...
Yeah, when Mega Man and Bass came out, it was actually under development.
It was titled Rock 8.5.
So, 9 is supposed to be a direct sequel, I mean an actual full sequel to 8 following through that whole thing.
But honestly, this is the one I will sit back and go, and for a little while, I can't do it now because of course it's been a while since I've played this game regularly.
I used to be able to do the dragon part blindfolded.
Because it's the same pattern, if you know the pattern.
I mean, I would die sometimes, but if you know the pattern, then it wasn't really all that hard, because it did the same damn thing every time.
Of course, if you don't have all your... That's more impressive than being able to do the quick man beams, in my opinion.
And also, if you don't know how to do... Well, if you don't save all your crash blocks to that one, like, right towards the end, then you're screwed for the whole rest of the game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
although I would recommend instead of getting it on virtual console just get, even though I know people at the GameCube version of the Mega Man Collection just get the Mega Man Collection
No, you have to have the Nintendo.
Whoa, what is going on over there?
I dropped the microphone.
Jamie's about ready to just run out of here now that it's break time.
No, I'm kidding.
Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
XBOX 360 CODE FOR FEEDING FRENZY 2

Giveaway here on Orange Lounge Radio We'll give that away next week live Gaming Radio, so uncensored That even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us Orange Lounge Radio And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday evening September the 28th of 2008 if you can believe it October's almost here and then pretty soon it'll be 2009
Where does the time go?
I don't know anymore
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Apparently, one of the routes that they're going with this is I guess it's going to support using SD memory cards.
So you'll be able to transfer stuff back and forth from your Wii system to your DS.
You'll be able to load songs onto it as well through that.
And the newspaper looks like Nikkei.
They are expecting that the system will be priced under 20,000 yen.
And the Nintendo DS Lite currently is priced at 16,800 yen in Japan.
And it looks like the new DS will launch first in Japan with other countries seeing an allocation of several hundred thousand units before anybody else overseas sees them.
Interesting and funny because this kind of goes in with the other story that's come out a couple days ago about how Nintendo will be doing a media event on October 2nd and 3rd.
Hmm, a little interesting that this comes out in a newspaper.
And I don't think that they would run rumors.
And what other announcements could we possibly expect from this media event?
Because this is, I think, their opportunity to save face from E3.
My guess, which is interesting, my guess would be, of course, announcing Disaster Day of Crisis since it's already out in Japan.
Europe is right around the corner.
They haven't announced a date for the U.S.
yet.
And the other thing I wouldn't be surprised if I saw was that they're publishing Conduit.
Because if you notice, for a game that doesn't have a publisher, there's sure a lot of screenshots coming out every single day.
And kind of the whole marketing campaign is in full force.
Kind of makes you go, hmm, why would they be trying to market this game so strongly right now when they don't even have a publisher yet?
Because usually the publisher is the one that does the marketing for them.
Interesting to think about that maybe this game is right around the corner.
And maybe Nintendo's publishing it.
After all, it was in Nintendo's booth at PAX.
Might be a guess.
Well, hey, before the show, and that DS is supposed to be out this year.
So that could be, you know, that's probably some of the strongest evidence as to why they would need a special press conference to announce it.
Yeah.
It's coming out this year.
Very interesting.
What do you think?
Would you buy a DS for the camera and the music and all this stuff?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Maybe.
I have to see if it's worth it.
I expected you to say give me a flat up no.
I'm kind of surprised.
The thing is, what other applications on the homebrew site could use this camera and stuff?
I'd be more interested to see that.
You just want to hack it.
Yes.
DarkSakura, what do you think?
I wouldn't waste my money on it.
I already have 50 million other things that do all that.
I've got an iPhone.
I don't need anything else that takes pictures or plays music.
Tiara, any thoughts for you on this?
Well, like I said on Twitter, if it's not broke, don't fix it.
I already have a DS that works, so there's no reason for me to buy another one.
Speaking of Twitter, let's go over there and look at the answers to tonight's pre-show question.
We do have a Twitter account at OLR, simply our Twitter name, and sometimes we ask some questions before the show and read some of our favorite answers on the air.
We asked, would you buy the Nintendo DS again if they re-release it with a camera and music playback abilities?
We got a lot of replies tonight, so I'm going to try to read from people we don't usually hear from.
in the chat room or on Skype.
JohnnyG44 says, no, because almost everyone has a phone that can do both of those things.
I would buy a new DS with onboard memory storage, though.
Crows says, I have a cell phone with two megapixels and an iPod with 30 gigabytes.
I don't need those features.
It would just make it cost like 300 bucks.
Frisbee says, no, most people have an MP3 player, a digital camera, a camera MP3 phone, and a DS already.
Why pay for all three of these all over again?
DarkCircuitry says, I don't have a DS in the first place, but I'd happily buy one if it had those extra features, albeit at a lower price than it is now.
Decipher13 says, I'm still packing a fat...
A fat, a DS fat I've held off on getting a light so far But I do collect Nintendo handhelds I may eventually I collect Nintendo handhelds Can you imagine though if they did have storage Like say a gig of storage space on there How bad that would make the Wii look
GBA Multiplayer Compatibility Back, but the camera would be flippin' awesome.
So kind of a wide variety of answers on our Twitter.
I didn't even read them all, but it's very varied in the yeses and nos there.
Thanks to everybody that replied on Twitter.
Sorry to those that didn't get through, but I tried to focus on those that usually don't join us in chat.
Very interesting, the diverse amount of responses.
I think there were enough yeses, though, that this is going to be successful if they release it.
Well, they're not really having trouble selling DSs right now, I think.
And they're not really...
I don't think the PSP is getting close to them anytime soon.
I think this is obviously competing against Apple.
I mean, because now that they're becoming the gaming portable system, I mean, that's hard to swallow, but you know.
Maybe this is the compete with them.
Because it's cheaper.
Possibly.
This seems kind of a long ways afterwards to compete with PSP.
And now that we have camera functionality, I mean, how long will it be before we get gimmicky shit to go along with that?
I mean, I don't know.
Well...
All right, well, you know, if they hadn't moved enough copies of the DS Lite, maybe doing some charitable work would convince more people to get a DS, and that is just what is happening.
Amazon has actually released a new version of the Nintendo DS, apparently, on their site.
It's what's called the Polar White Console, but one special difference between this and a normal DS is that it actually has the pink breast cancer awareness ribbon, kind of like a universal logo, if you will, right there on the DS itself.
It's going to be $129.99, which is what any other DS would cost, but Nintendo is donating $5 from every purchase of one of these Nintendo DSs to a cancer research charity, a very commonly heard one in breast cancer awareness circles, Susan G. Komen for the cure.
The minimum donation promised is $100,000.
So there you go, if you want to do a little bit of charity.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't see myself going out and buying another DS just for this when I could donate $20 myself.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.
I'm going to ask a question I think is out there, but some people might be too afraid to ask.
I'm going to put it out there.
Is this another way that Nintendo is trying to get women?
I mean, I hate to say it's a marketing ploy, but in a way, look at what they've been advertising lately.
Carrie Underwood, Pink DSes.
Is this a way for them to try and attract women to the Nintendo DS?
I would totally date Nintendo DS if he got a better job and could prove that he's into being committed to our relationship.
What does him adoring a pink ribbon do for you?
Does it make him that much sexier?
Not really.
If I wanted to donate $5 towards breast cancer, I could just donate $5 instead of going out and buying a whole new DS.
Or I could donate however much I want and get that as a tax write-off, where it doesn't work that way if you buy the pink DS and let Nintendo give them $5.
Yeah.
Well, on top of that, with all of these, you know, for example, the runs, the marketing going in behind this, that's money they're spending on marketing and organizing events that actually just could go to the research.
Especially for, you know, as poorly coordinated as a lot of the research is right now, they should put, you know, the money into... We're all aware.
The awareness is there.
You know, I think that the money is better...
And you can go on the- Apply towards the event, you know, towards not the awareness of, but the treatment thereof.
And if you don't know how to donate, I mean, you can go to their website online.
It's so simple and pretty much, I mean, there's links to tell you how to donate right there.
I mean- Komen.org, K-O-M-E-N.org.
Exactly.
There you go.
I'm sorry, but this is, it does seem kind of like a cheap attempt to get women to play their damn console.
I mean, I hate to say it, but you know a lot of people are thinking it.
If you really want to make an impact to breast cancer and you don't really care about this console, donate $129.99 to breast cancer then.
There you go.
Well, I think there's a happy medium somewhere, but it's just... Or charge a little more money for it.
They do that with postage stamps, right?
They charge a little more money for it, but it's that extra money that goes towards the research.
It's kind of like a donation.
I don't know.
It's just so that they can come out later on and go, look, we donated $100,000 to breast cancer.
We're so...
We're so helpful.
It's all for PR.
It's all to make them look good.
Giovedea in our chatroom says, Sorry, but as a girl, I'd probably break a pink DS with a hammer because it would be fun.
So sometimes, you know, you don't always get all the women with the pink and all that, but my question would be, but what do you think of the white DS with the pink ribbon?
What about, you know, because they always talk about breast cancer and stuff, and they have really good campaigns for breast cancer and cervical cancer and that kind of stuff, but heart disease, just lung cancer, you know, diabetes, stuff like that, you know, that kills a lot more people than breast cancer, so...
How about donating to that instead, too?
All right.
There's no ribbon for that, unfortunately, so, you know.
Certainly some controversial opinions in the community.
We look forward to hearing yours.
Mailbag at orange.radio.com.
Jamie will read them all live on air.
All right.
Just like she'll read the next story.
The next story is Orange Lounge Radio host Rob Roberts ended up being found in the garbage, chopped to tiny bits, with a I told you so from co-host.
That's sad.
Yeah, only to you.
Anyway, for our wee friends, who are wee little friends...
Who are not only virtual console users, but love NEC and Hudson and all the things associated with the PC Engine slash TurboGrafx.
We are getting SuperGrafx games!
And I have to apologize to Bobby for what I...
A little bit of incorrectness on my comment.
The Super Graphics actually was the successor to the PC Engine, especially the PC Engine Duo with the arcade card units, as 100% backwards compatible and had new Super Hue card games that you could play.
and also these other peripherals that never ended up coming out for it, including a fully functional, well, a full representation of a flight joystick like they've got for, you know, the flight simulators on PC now.
But at any rate, Super Graphics games are going to be coming to Virtual Console.
The first of them being Dai Makai Mura, which was Ghouls and Ghosts.
and honestly I've seen the Super Graphics version of it and it's one of the best ever as far as any type of home system port so I am personally very excited about that.
Nintendo hasn't announced a US release but there are NEC console and ports on the shop channel so hey.
Maybe we'll be getting it.
That'll be pretty cool.
But on top of that, other games that we could be looking forward to that came out on Super Graphics in Japan was 1941 Counter-Attack.
Well, really, I think that's about all the ones that we're going to know for sure, except for there was a rumor that Strider was, there was a prototype for it, so we could be getting a really good version of Strider if they decided to do a release on that, although the last PC Engine release of that was a
The Arcade Card Version for PC Engine Duo.
I'm really excited.
The Super Graphics... The games were expensive, dude.
They were like $110 a piece for HuCards.
It could have done better if it wasn't so expensive.
How many of these are actually out there?
Not a lot, right?
There were seven created.
Two were unreleased.
One of them... No, I'm not talking about the games.
I'm talking about the systems itself.
Oh, the systems.
Yeah, there's not a lot of them out there, right?
Super Potato, Akihabara, Duo LT
I'm looking right now on eBay, just curious what people would charge for these.
And I see one NEC Super Graphic System with Battle Ace.
New, very rare.
$89.99, which isn't bad, but there's six days left on it.
So who knows what that's going to look like.
I can see that auction going to about $200, $250, like what this one was.
But then again, you can also buy a...
I'll find out how many of them they produced
All right, well, anyhow, regardless, you know, it's going to bring a whole, you know, even though I guess not a whole lot of new games, but certainly something that probably a lot of people never have experienced before to the market via virtual console.
So that's neat, I suppose.
I bet you'll be checking out some of these games, DarkSakura.
I'm definitely interested in getting Daimakai Mora, although, honestly, I have the Saturn release, which was the arcade version.
But it'd be cool, I mean, to have it on, especially getting that over Super Ghouls N' Ghosts, because, honestly, that game was kind of crap for being in that series.
What was the... Cho Makai Mora was the name for that one, even going by the original name.
Um...
But I'm checking it out and I don't see exactly how many were made.
Well, they should just release all the games at once.
Just have a big Super Graphics week.
Although I somehow doubt that'll happen.
But it actually seems pretty cool, though, that it used two independently scrolling background layers as far as its graphics.
I put sort of like how the Genesis did, which, you know, was like one of the... In fact, they had a problem with some of the releases of the games for one system versus the other because of if it was a single or dual layer for the app, it had used two video chips.
It was a pretty advanced system for its time.
It just was pretty darn expensive.
Yeah.
FaceDistantChat asks, wait, five games were released for the console.
How long a life could that have on virtual console?
Well, I don't know if it's necessarily about trying to milk the life of the system, but let's face it, Nintendo or the companies behind it share in the profits of however much they're going to charge for each one of these games.
Let's say $7 for each sale.
That's $7 they weren't going to get before, especially for a lot of people who have never played.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
All right.
Pippin
I don't know about that, but...
A plethora of other awesome animated films.
We'll be doing the animation for that title as well.
To make the game unique, it will come with a Magic Master Book.
I guess that will be shared by the main character of the game, which needs to be referred to while playing the game.
Also, they will be making a console version at some point.
So that's kind of cool.
Nice to see some pretty solid animated games coming to the DS.
Have we had a new Studio Ghibli movie in a while?
We haven't seen one.
I thought there was a new one coming.
I thought there was one that was coming out this year or something.
I just haven't heard much of it.
Maybe it already came out in Japan and it's not out here yet.
I haven't, ever since I got out of the movie department, and, you know, I haven't really been paying attention to what new movies are coming out from that studio, so, uh, yeah.
But all of them are gold, I mean, seriously.
Yeah, they're good movies.
So I'm very curious to see what kind of game comes out of this, because it could either be really good or just one of those things that looks good on paper.
Level 5 is not stopping there with that partnership.
They are also going to be making some new games for the PSP.
They don't really have anything to do with the Studio Ghibli project.
However, they are doing some other games on the PSP.
One of them is called Ushiro.
It's kind of a scary RPG, if you want to say, for the PSP.
You will actually kind of play as a Shingami.
It's a god of death in Japanese lore.
And you will fight monsters and also grant people's wishes.
Dambol Senki Cardboard War Machine RPG Projects for the PSP coming from level 5
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
No more ports on the PSP!
Well, they actually kind of port it in reverse a lot of times.
They port PSP games to PS2.
Well, I kind of thought that was interesting.
They don't want ports on the PSP.
But I'm thinking, well, they've still got some big sellers.
Like Puzzle Quest would be a port that's a big sell, right?
Why would you want to say no to that?
Well, I think they were looking for games that are developed specifically for the PSP.
Because a lot of the games that come out, the PSP version isn't exactly that strong.
and so it's making the console look kind of weak but I think they need I don't know it's like a double edged sword there they need more units to be sold so more publishers get interested in it but they need more publishers interested in it so they can get more units sold
Before DarkSakura gets to the next story, I got the answer to the question I was looking for.
SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea just came out from Studio Ghibli.
And I thought I heard something about that that was the name of the new movie.
But correct me if I'm wrong, it's only out in Japan, right?
It hasn't come out here because Disney has to do their thing with the translation and all that.
We probably won't see it until early next year, probably.
All right, we can move on with gaming news.
Right, DarkSakura?
That we can.
Well, there is some news for City of Heroes.
I know that there are plenty of people who still play that.
That the mission editor is actually going to be delayed.
So now issue 13 is to be retitled Power and Responsibility.
Okay.
Everything else was supposed to come out with the architect mode and an extension for the sidekick buddy system that's a leveling pact.
Basically it lets you and your friends synchronize your experience so that you're always at the same level.
Even if one person plays more than the other.
So you can play together more on an even keel.
That's kind of cool.
Also, there's multi-builds, so you can keep two different versions of the same character.
There's also day jobs, power sets, and merit rewards will be included as well.
And they say that the architect, mission, editor will be coming out later.
But also, part of the thing in it is supposed to let you create your own NPCs for those missions.
So that's pretty cool.
Very cool.
Well,
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
But yes, Punisher will be getting not only a new movie this year, but a new game thanks to the PlayStation Network.
Punisher No Mercy is exclusive to the PlayStation Network and will be coming to us from Zen Studios, who unfortunately don't have much of a...
Uh, resume, but, uh, Rocky and Bullwinkle, the Xbox Live Arcade game, and the new Mushroom Man game, which look kind of, eh, alright.
But who knows?
Maybe this is the, uh, Diamond in the Rough.
Um, it will be powered by the Unreal 3 engine, and of course we'll follow, uh, you know, Frank Castle as he seeks revenge.
And, um, they've got some screenshots out for the game so far.
It actually looks pretty good.
Um, no word on how it's gonna play.
But, um...
Apparently also, I guess, I don't know.
It's no word on when exactly it's going to be released.
I would imagine maybe around the time of the film.
Oh, that's what it says.
Aiming to release the game in line with the new Punisher film.
And it will include both single and multiplayer modes as well, character customizations and trophies.
Why did everyone hate Rocky and Bullwinkle?
I don't know, the fun factor was kind of missing from that game, especially for something so nostalgic.
The game just kind of felt cheap to me.
It's really hard to put my finger on it, but it just kind of felt like it wasn't any fun.
The minigames were kind of like they might make you smile for a second, but then you're like, I can't see myself playing this again.
It would have been a better game on the Wii.
You think?
With the motion control and everything?
Maybe.
I mean, it's just the Wii seems to be the party game machine, but at the same time it's getting overkill with that stuff.
That genre is way too much on there.
It's like if you want to call the Xbox 360 a first person shooter console, then the Wii is definitely the party game console.
All right, moving on.
And this is going to, you know, our longtime fans, you know, because I think we mentioned this quite often.
We had started originally way back on episode one.
It's a show really revolving around music-based video games, and especially DDR was a big focus of this game, of that era of Orange Launch Radio.
I'm sure a lot of our listeners who remember that still follow what goes on in the DDR world are going to find this news very interesting because it isn't about DDR, but a possible new competitor to DDR.
Not a lot is known about it, but we do know that a patent has been filed with the official U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office by Activision for a game called Dance Hero.
Guitar Hero, Dance Hero, Video Game Controllers
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and rebuild the game from the ground up and in a way I think that's exactly what's going to happen here with what Activision is doing is that they're going to take a dance game concept and rebuild it from the ground up so that could be very interesting and I'm not ready to scream theft just yet because I have a feeling this could be something kind of new and innovative
You know what I mean?
I don't know.
What do you guys think?
New and innovative.
From a company who ripped off Guitar Freak's Drum Mania and beat Mania.
Might make it better.
Might make it better.
To be honest, I don't think they're really going to change it.
It's probably going to look like a guitar hero type of game, but instead of maybe notes scrolling down the screen, it's going to be arrows or steps or feet or something.
I don't know.
To that effect.
But...
I know, I hear you.
They're whoring the brand to death, seriously.
Right, right.
And I see all those concerns, but at the same time, I kind of feel like, oh, somebody might be finally reinventing the approach to the dance game.
Because let's face it, every other dance game that's come out in the groove...
Uh, the, the, what am I thinking of?
The freaking game that you can use your own CDs on that was terrible on the PS2?
What the hell was that game?
Dance Factory.
Factory or whatever, yeah, Dance Factory or whatever.
They've all pretty much been the same damn thing.
It's four arrows that you stomp to.
Well, maybe this could be something different.
DJ Hero sounds like guitar hero, but exchange the guitar for a DJ turntable.
I mean, seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if you could use the DJ turntable in your game.
and Guitar Hero because it probably is just another controller.
Instead of the strum bar, it's scratching and instead of the fret buttons, it's keys.
Oh my god!
So much innovation, it blows my mind!
Will I be able to get Star Power 2 by shaking the turntable?
Oh, maybe I'll have a crossfader for that, you know?
God!
I'm sorry.
I'm not interested.
I'll bet you, you know what?
You know why?
Because they have Guitar Hero behind them, and they have these games behind them, they're going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted for DDR.
And they're not going to have to fill up a song list with originals.
Granted, we as DDR fans have come to know and love those Konami originals, but it's part of the reason why the game didn't sell as well over here.
They're having to rely on a lot of Japan-centric songs.
They're going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted in DDR.
And they know it.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Speculation Speculation
It is.
It's all speculation.
Track record.
They hoard this thing.
I swear to God, they hoard this thing so bad.
You watch next year when Guitar Hero has four to six game releases and people are going, my God.
I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero... Five cents.
No, more than that.
I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero will sell more copies than Beat Mania did here in this country.
Yeah, I can guarantee that will happen.
and I don't know if I can make the same thing for Dance Hero because, you know, it has done very, very well.
But DJ Hero will sell by its name alone.
It could be the worst game ever, but people go, oh my god, I want to be a DJ.
But what if it's not bad?
I'm not saying DJ Hero will be bad.
I'm saying Dance Hero will be bad.
What if it's not?
It's gonna suck.
It's gonna suck.
Alright.
Big time.
If it sells more than... Okay, how many copies of Guitar Hero, the first Guitar Hero sold?
Oh, I don't know.
During its first month of release.
Not enough until it went on 360.
I don't think.
Well, plus they had to get the first game out there to license the songs everybody wanted to play.
It doesn't matter anyways, because this game will never... So, say that it sells more in its first month than Guitar Hero did...
Dance Hero will not sell more than Guitar Hero did in its first month.
Do you bet you're... Oh, oh, oh, no, I disagree, sir.
I think there's a bet forming here.
No, there is not a bet forming here.
The only bet is the Eye of Judgment, okay?
This is just a registered trademark.
We don't know what this is at all.
So why are you thinking that it's going to... Because I saw the Eye of Judgment.
I'm like, wow, that is a piece of shit.
But you haven't seen Dance Hero.
What is the point of this game?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, we can go ahead and take the devil's advocate thing, but the fact of the matter is they need a peripheral with every one of these fucking hero games.
So what is the magic peripheral that's going to come along with this?
And really, is it going to innovate anything other than having a better song list?
Thanks for watching!
You know what, though?
Everything's a matter of time.
Track record is two words.
Speculation is one word.
You were supposed to sum it up in one word.
Therefore, you are disqualified and your opinion is thrown out.
I make my own damn rules.
That's okay because we're entitled to make our own rules and change them at will.
You lose.
A man will never win an argument with a woman because we're awesome and men aren't.
Sorry.
Wow.
You should know that.
You're married.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nelly, if you're listening, come up here and lay down the law.
All right.
Wow.
All right.
You know what?
You know what?
Lots of good, you know what?
Whether you agree with Loki or not, you know, lots of good points being brought up around the board.
And I'm sure we're going to have some calls on it later as well.
I mean, no offense to Dan's here, but I think the logical step for them would be to do like a keyboard hero because that's at least something you can add.
Because we haven't had keyboard mania.
Exactly.
Well, we haven't had DDR either.
Seriously, fuck Konami with a big chainsaw for disbanding that series.
I know, Keyboard Mania was fantastic.
Because Keyboard Mania I was actually pretty good at.
Who is in charge of the DDR series now?
Is it like on autopilot or something?
Because, I mean, what is seriously happening?
I really do think they should bring a keyboard thing out because in that way you can add it to Guitar Hero World Tour You can have keyboards with a lot of stuff Who doesn't want to play Van Halen's Jump?
We need sax maniacs This is going to lead to Bagpipe Hero and Didgeridoo Hero Sitar Hero Let's move on
DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and reads a few of her favorites.
After she drinks some soda.
Well, the music's playing.
What are we going to do?
Just sit here and wait?
Well, we can stare at the ants.
Is there more ants now?
Yeah, but they're attacking something on the floor and I don't really know what.
I saw like a trail of them.
They're running over there.
I'm off to get the raid.
Oh, I can't because I don't smell like raid in here.
God damn it.
How about a fire?
Email time.
Let's set fire to the floor and burn all the ants.
Did you ever watch that YouTube video of the guy burning the hornet's nest on his child's swing set?
Oh my gosh.
Setting it on fire with as many different flammable things as he could find.
I was like, stupid.
I think I'll be looking that up right now.
Okay.
Setting fire to swing set.
Look up fucking moron and you'll find him.
Well, that could be a ton of videos on there.
I gotta look fire swing set.
Okay.
I think it's fire and hornets, but anyway.
First email comes from Hunter Red, aka Redertainment.
Hey, y'all.
You know, I can't say y'all without saying it in accent.
Y'all.
As you know, the season where the masses choose which douchebag will represent them is upon us and I have a question to that end.
I'm going to send an email to all the douchebags running for Congress in my district and I want to ask them how they feel about video games and the legislation that is currently pending about them.
Is there a way I should phrase my email so that I can get a response from them other than not calling them douchebags?
That's gonna smell, man.
I would have done it.
But it'll smell.
I know that because I would have done it.
By the way, Sky, that means you, Mr. I've-left-the-studio-try-to-set-fire-to-the-ant.
Sorry, I was getting fire.
By the way, Sky, if you hate the influence of the Mormon church and politics in California, you should come to Utah.
They're everywhere and are everything.
No, I've heard about Utah, and it's, you know, it's just, you know, you guys, if you listened to the show last week, you already know how I feel about Proposition 8 and how it's, you know, setting civil rights back about 50 years, but, you know, what can you do?
Honestly, if you want to see the influence of the Mormon church, just go talk to a, you know, Boy Scout troop.
Thanks, love the show, you do what I ask for any podcasts I listen to, work to do, inform, entertain, and make me laugh.
Thanks again, Hunter Red, a.k.a.
Redertainment.
You're welcome.
Next one?
Yes.
Hey, guys.
Dan Shadow here with your helpful hints for Warhammer Online.
There are thousands of tome unlocks and hundreds of titles you can earn.
I'm going to help you get some of the nicer title unlocks.
First, take off all your clothes.
Second, use 100 abilities to be known as the show-off.
Third, talk to 100 citizens while naked to be a flirt.
If you target another naked player 100 times, you'll become the ogler.
If you want to get a nice title that doesn't involve nudity, then jump off a cliff and die.
If you do this 25 times, you can have the word AHHHHH floating above your head.
That's all the helpful hints for this week.
I just got into the LittleBigPlanet beta, so I'll let you guys know how that one goes when I can.
See ya!
I want to be in the little big planet beta so that I don't even have a PS3.
I just want a key to say I'm in it and you're not.
I want to be in a game and have, ah, floating over my head.
Or remember there was Impossible Mission.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge.
No, OLR's not over.
Sorry.
And the show's canceled.
Good night, everyone.
Next email.
My question for OLR this week is, do you guys have a backlog of video games to play slash finish and how large is the backlog?
Oh shit, you really want me to answer that?
Personally, I have a backlog on PS2 and even on the Xbox 360, which I only purchased a couple months ago.
The majority are some RPGs and some action games.
I feel that DDR and World of Warcraft sometimes eat up a lot of my free time, but I'm not sure what stops me from finishing some games.
As promised, Triple A to an old school DDR song, Burn in the Floor, in honor of OLR and 300th show.
He actually sent a picture of it too.
This email is brought to you by DarkSakura School of Dancing Ferrets.
Peace out and AAA Jammer Jones.
Off the top of my head, Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, Final Fantasy XII.
They're all games I need to... Kingdom Hearts 2.
Shit, I never finished that one.
I got really far but I didn't finish it.
There's tons of games I need to finish.
I have a gaming ADD.
I've said it a million times on this show.
Especially this time of year.
That's a huge ass freaking picture.
How can you play...
Just one game this time of year.
It seems like every week leading up to Christmas, there's a new freaking game coming out that I have to play.
Like Fable 2 is coming out soon, and I barely have touched Warhammer, Spore even.
I think I've sunk maybe five hours into Spore, tops.
And already there's new games coming out I want.
Thanks for watching!
and a perfect score I'll tell you the big one here's the big one Strong Bad, the episodic Strong Bad's games I freaking know people that have worked on those games and I keep saying I'm going to support them and I want to play the games I haven't even touched them yet just because there's been so much else that have been grabbing my attention but I really do want to play the Strong Bad games at some point
My present backlog is I actually do want to go back and finish Kingdom Hearts 2.
And I actually never finished Final Fantasy X because I got so pissed off that I had rushed through leveling the game that I got to one of the battles with What's-His-Stupid-Face with his ugly blue hair.
And I got to the Glyph Mine battle past that and none of my characters were high enough to stand one hit.
So that's my own bad.
And I...
I still have to finish Kingdom Hearts 2, but I glitched the game in a major way.
Nice.
I skipped some level, and now I can't get into doing the Pride Lands.
So it's pretty stupid.
I think I did Halloween Town twice in a row or something.
But...
Next email.
Next email.
I was just wondering and I just started listening to the podcast so I'm not certain if you guys have talked about this what you guys thought about the makers of Psychonauts making a sequel seeing as how I think it was rated as 14th greatest Xbox even though it wasn't a great seller to my knowledge Xbox Live Gamer Tag Quick Sticks
Excellent question.
That's another one of those games I didn't play a lot of.
I have played Psychonauts, just not a lot in depth.
I don't see how it's a bad thing, though.
Psychonauts had a lot of fans, and a lot of people have been slowly discovering that game over the years.
It's kind of like a cult game, like a cult movie.
Not a lot of people see it when it first comes out, but it sells really well on DVD.
People want to go back and check it out later.
That's kind of what Psychonauts is.
It's one of those games that people get together and sacrifice virgins on altars in the basement of their building.
and Drink the Kool-Aid.
No, it's not that kind of game.
But I didn't play enough of the first one to really say, oh, I'm excited about a sequel.
But I know that the first game was unique enough with a cool sense of humor about it that I think a second game will be welcome.
And I bet you more people check out the sequel than the first one.
And making a sequel, honestly, will get more people to check out the original, which is available as an Xbox Live original, if I'm not mistaken.
One of our listeners, I guess, I'm not ever quite sure how to pronounce it, but I think it's Nige, but anyway, one of our British listeners saw a story on the BBC News website and linked it to us, which is a Germany arrest over gamer death where a man is arrested in Germany on suspicion of the murder of a 20-year-old internet gamer in Nottingham.
Checking out the article as soon as it loads up.
and I'll link the article in the chat room since it's very nice to share that with us as soon as the damn thing loads.
Matthew Pike, 20, was found stabbed in his flat above the Orange Tree Pub on North Sherwood Street on Friday.
So the one arrested was a guy from Lindbergh and
So does that mean if you can't beat them, you should gank them?
Nice.
But thank you for sharing that with us.
Also, Cheeseburger, somebody go smack Cheeseburger around with the large trout in the chat room for me, because the email was dongle.
Nice.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Last email.
This comes from Isabel.
These are just some photos me and my friend took for Pyramid Head Day.
We made cupcakes with little Pyramid Head heads on top of them and I made a Pyramid Head costume.
Happy Pyramid Head Day.
Hope Silent Hill Homecoming is awesome.
But none of you get to see them because I haven't actually uploaded them anywhere.
They're on our email.
But they are funny and cute and Pyramid Head is tasty delicious.
Hooray for Peahitty Day.
Well, I'm really glad that people actually went and celebrated Pyramid Head Day.
That's wonderful.
I hope we get more pictures over the coming weeks.
It's Peahitty Day.
Peahitty Day.
Vote or Peahitty will kill you.
Seriously.
That's it for email.
All right.
If you want to send us an email next time, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
Bungie
The game developer believes that game companies should pocket money from used game sales.
And it seems, I guess, that they feel since the used sales, like for example, had a big impact on Halo.
And when you have a multi-million dollar seller game and I guess they're losing money on used copies of the game.
I think they're wrong though, because that's retarded.
If I buy something and I sell it to somebody else, why should you get a piece of that?
Yeah, like if I sell, you know, my refrigerator to someone else because I'm going to get a newer, fancier refrigerator, I don't have to send Maytag 20 bucks.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, it's basically like, you know, I saw like some comments or something, talkbacks about it.
It's like you own your money 100% and it's all bartering basically because you're trading your money.
for 100% ownership of said game.
So if they want a portion of when you sell that game, then you should get a portion of the money that they spend on, say, when they buy groceries.
CD industry's had to deal with this for years.
It hasn't killed them.
Piracy killed the CD industry.
Exactly.
I think, I mean...
Use game sales can be good because you say a consumer doesn't really want to buy your game at full price and say they buy Halo 1 and then they like it and then they go out and buy Halo 2 when it comes out.
So it's extra sales.
I don't see how this is a bad thing and besides, you already got paid.
Okay?
I mean, why are they even complaining about the fact that they don't sell as many units because they've already sold those units to retail stores.
The retail stores now have to sell them
And if they decide to sell used games over new games, like a lot of these game stores like GameStop, they push their used sales.
In fact, if they have a used copy, they'll be like, hey, do you want the used copy instead?
They push those first because they're making more money off of them anyway.
So what's it matter?
Because they've already paid you for the product.
You're not losing out on anything.
TheRobD has an interesting comment in chat.
Guess what, developers?
DLC exists.
Give us a reason to keep it.
Even better, make additional content free.
Exactly.
Give us a reason to keep your game.
Download content where it's at because that's a way you can make more money off of each game you sell.
I don't know.
Yeah, I definitely don't think that they should ever get to the point where they have to get a portion of you to sell.
That's just stupid.
All right, well, moving on to other people that want a piece of the pie.
Activision Blizzard has gone on the record.
The CEO, Bobby Kotick, has said basically a response to what the Warner Music executive, Edgar Bronfman, said previously.
And what he had said was that the royalty rates for songs that are used in Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and so on are paltry.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Maybe people should be paying them to put their songs in the game.
It's like free advertising.
No, because the songs make the game.
And if you want to take that route and like, well, we're not going to put any songs in our game unless you pay us to do it.
Yeah, go right ahead and see what your song list looks like then.
Right, that's a very good point.
Without these songs, then the game is going to be nothing.
But at the same time, there's kind of a fine line here because I think if these guys get too greedy, especially if it's one company over the others...
Then they'll be able to still put out a perfectly solid game from music from other labels that are out there.
Well, just look at some other companies doing similar things.
GameStop, and I'm sure this is true for a lot of other retailers as well, they charge companies to put their games in the store.
They charge them for shelf space.
They actually, when they have signage in their store for a certain game, they make those companies pay for that signage to be in their store.
I mean, that's just ridiculous.
It's the same thing with this.
They're saying, oh, well, our game is immensely popular, and because of it, your music is becoming more popular.
Well, the reason people buy that game in the first place is because of your song list.
And if your song list sucks, then people won't buy your game.
And then you won't have your popularity.
In my mind, both sides stand to lose something if they can't agree on it.
And I would say then, I think it should stay the way it is.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Sonic M88 in chat says, over at chat.orange.com says, I discovered a lot of great songs in the Guitar Hero games.
I love playing the game despite the fact that I didn't know most of the songs.
So, you know, but there are music game fans that are going to play these games no matter what, even if they don't know a single song in them.
But I think certainly part of the reason why Guitar Hero really kind of broke out in some sense is because it was a lot of those songs you've always wanted to play on the guitar.
You know what I mean?
Plus, they did a really good job marketing their game.
I think as well.
They got it out there in the press.
You remember when that guy went over to Jamie's house and you guys got interviewed for the news?
That was probably because Red Octane put out a press release about the game and was able to call attention to it.
They were very good at getting themselves in the papers and everything.
Just kind of a thought.
It's also pretty fun.
I mean, on top of that, it just seemed to me like there was a much better appreciation to the gamers themselves that actually wanted to work with the community.
Right.
All right, well, let's move on with some more news.
Ghostbusters Game
So, you know, for all those rumors been floating around about another Ghostbusters movie, that might actually be a little bit more likely.
Maybe.
We hope.
As long as he's not too old for it.
Well, we'll see.
Maybe he's realizing that some of these other movies he's making aren't exactly as good as, you know, he hasn't exactly been on a big movie streak lately.
I don't know.
I just couldn't see that Ghostbusters 3 would actually be that big of a movie if they did one.
You know what I mean?
Maybe a lot of it depends on star power and who they get in the movie.
But if they don't have the right people in the movie, I don't know if there'd really be that much interest in a Ghostbusters 3.
You know what I mean?
TigerClaw says there is a third Ghostbusters movie in the works.
It's being written by the writers of The Office.
Wasn't that only a rumor?
I think that was a rumor.
I don't know.
Anyways, there's one of the games that they were talking about at E3.
That was Mag the Massive Action Game, I guess.
It will apparently be not free to play.
They are going to plan on charging either a yearly or monthly fee.
They will also have one-time fees for content downloads as well.
Also, I guess it mentions that they may have hosting partners like EA and Activision.
hmm but uh I don't know I guess this is sort of it didn't really seem like an MMO to me but it is kind of surprising though that an online game like this won't be free to play but I guess when you have like 256 players you probably need some serious network hardware for that hmm I don't know we'll just hopefully make the game cheap the buy then if that's the case you know like Warhawk or something where it's 40 bucks instead of 60 yeah
All right.
Well, remember when we used to learn a lot of things from our games?
Well, there was a little piece that's been circulating around different gaming blogs this week.
It's from the Educational Games Research blog, which kind of puts out information regularly about educational games.
They compiled a list this week, the top 10 most influential educational video games from the 1980s.
Now, keep in mind, it's just one guy's opinion.
It's someone who...
Number 3, SimCity
Number four, Reader Rabbit.
Remember Reader Rabbit?
Number five, Math Blaster, which was very similar to Reader Rabbit.
Or no, no, it weren't that they were similar, but it seems like both those games were kind of like hand-in-hand games.
I don't know about you guys, but it seemed like when I was younger, those games kind of were hand-in-hand.
Number six, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.
Number seven, Lemonade Stand.
8.
Number Munchers 9.
Zork 10.
Windows Solitaire
I guess that's something that you're supposed to you learn how to use the mouse with it so it's an educational game which I can see that but it's just very odd to see that on this list and number 11 M U L E which is strange because it's a top 10 list but they put Mule on this list as well which is a great game that I guess you know you kind of learn about barter and exchange in that game but I don't know if I'd call that an educational game either of particular interest why this story kind of piqued my interest because I've seen this around on different gaming blog sites this week um
I tackled this same topic a year ago on my personal blog that I was running for a while back when the All Games Radio Ning site was a little more popular.
In fact, I'll link it here in chat.
You can actually read my list here.
Sorry for those guys that are listening on the podcast.
You can't see this, but just go to allgamesradio.ning.com and look for my profile and you'll find this.
This was my list of the top 10 edutainment games of all time because I used to play a lot of them growing up.
Number 10, The Incredible Machine.
Rocky's Boots is a hell of a lot of fun.
Number eight, I just...
Apple Logo, because it was kind of like your first programming language that you would learn in school.
Number seven, I also put Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.
Number six, I also put Math Blasters.
Number five, I put a game called Cave of the Word Wizard.
It was a game that you had on the Commodore 64, and what made this game notable is that it actually used the Commodore 64's speech chip to actually say the names of words that you would have to spell out to the Word Wizard, where he'd take away your health, or your flashlight battery, and then if your battery goes out, you basically die of death.
You get eaten alive by bats.
No, I don't know, but you don't want your flashlight battery to run out.
And I put number four, where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego.
Number three, The Island of Dr. Brain.
That was a great educational title.
Again, it wasn't the 80s, so that's probably why it wasn't on the other guy's list.
And then I put number two, Number Munchers, and number one, The Oregon Trail.
So kind of funny that I don't know, you know, I don't profess to be an educational games expert, yet my list was pretty similar, except for the fact I had a couple games from the 90s in there.
So...
I don't know, I just thought I'd share that.
Nobody read the article when I posted it the first time.
Where's Lee's Resuit, Larry?
It's not an educational game, Loki.
I don't care what you think you learned from it.
It is not technically an educational game.
Amaze Satsuma is looking at my blog saying, man, did number munchers really look that bad?
Yes, it did.
The first version did.
They made prettier versions of it as time went on, but the very first version was very plain looking.
It was Atari 2600 style graphics.
All right, enough about educational games.
Let's get back to brain rotting games.
Hey, it's not brain rotting, it's just, um, well, violent.
And violence is always good.
It helps release tension or something.
Um, well, basically, this is, uh, some very good news for all of those people who had always, you know, had the, uh, you must defeat Shenlong to stand a chance and thinking it was, uh, you know, this was a hidden character or something.
um actually uh Goken who was supposed to be uh Ryu and Ken's uh teacher uh is going to be a uh a hidden character in the game but he's not playable he's just going to show up every so often beat the crap out of you toasty um but it is uh there is an unlock procedure for it but um he's gonna be hardcore tough sweet
So yeah, that's pretty happy.
Of course, you know, I have a feeling that someone's going to find some way to control him.
Blah, blah, blah.
Or he'll be a download character.
Yep.
Or something.
A pay to unlock.
Yep.
Well, if there's going to be another Grand Theft Auto game coming out, then there's got to be another controversy coming with it.
And of course, with the announcement of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, and now that more details are leaking out about it,
People are throwing a fit.
In fact, the British tabloid The Sun, which for some reason is now covering video game stuff every now and then, has a headline called Fury Over Drug Deal Vid Game.
And, of course, includes comments from a guy named Darren Gold of a support group called Drugs Line.
And anything using drug dealing as entertainment is sending out the wrong message.
Glamourism doesn't help our work in trying to educate kids of the dangers of substance misuse.
Awesome!
And you know what?
I agree with you in the fact that kids should be taught about drugs and how bad they are and stuff.
The other thing is kids shouldn't be playing this game because it's rated M. So, my god, people, please.
And in case, if you didn't notice, you can sell drugs in this game.
Because...
Grand Theft Auto likes to piss people off and controversy sells.
So, awesome.
But remember, parents, the ratings are on the box for a reason.
And you know, if you don't really give a shit about the ratings, then do your kids a favor and buy them porn.
DJ Darkknight in chat says, Winners don't use drugs.
Remember the old FBI warning?
Which, by the way, have you ever noticed that in, I don't think it's in Rock Band 1, but in Rock Band 2, there's an arcade level that you play in, and you can, if you actually look at the screens, one of them has that little FBI warning on it that says, Winners don't use drugs.
I thought that was pretty awesome.
Kudos to whoever at Harmonix snuck that in.
Good job, you.
Tiger Claw posted a link in chat of some pictures of the drug dealing minigame.
Which is strange because haven't no pictures of this game been released?
No, they have been.
They were in a game magazine called Game... Was it Nintendo Power?
Yes, I'm sure no one's heard of it.
Um...
It's like saying, oh my god, fire's hot.
It is? !
One more piece of kind of late breaking news for you guys.
It's a very big rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor.
Apparently, over at an Xbox India event that has happened over in Delhi, India, apparently it has been confirmed, I use that term loosely though, that there will be a slim Xbox 360 console that will be released in 2009.
This is coming from some Indian gaming blogs.
Apparently they are also saying that India is going to be getting some time with Fable 2, Gears of War 2, and Fallout 3 a week earlier than supposedly anyone else is supposed to be.
Hmm, I'm quite skeptical.
Well, they may get to try it a week before it comes out, but big deal.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
I don't know, though.
I mean, I guess a redesign of the console makes sense, although they never redesigned the original Xbox.
They didn't really let it live its full life, either.
They kind of rushed the 360 out, you know?
By the way, Major Nelson has actually commented on it.
He told popular blog Xbox360Fanboy that quote, I have no knowledge of an event in India and therefore anything related to one.
I think we all know that if we had something to say, we'd be saying it.
Hmm.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
A digital camera built in to a console.
Yeah, because a console really uses the camera.
By the way, that reminds me, I got a buy... It was a DS joke.
Yeah, I know it was a DS joke.
I caught that.
Oh my god, really?
Was that something we talked about earlier?
Yeah, it was.
It's what we call like a loopback joke.
I know, that's so crazy.
It's like... Have you been paying attention for the past hour?
It's almost like foreshadowing, but in reverse, backshadowing.
Any other smart-ass comments before I open up the Skype line?
No, I was gonna say that more people will need to buy a camera for LittleBigPlanet, I guess, when it comes out, because it uses the PlayStation Eye heavily.
So are you encouraging people to run out and buy Eye of Judgment so they can get the camera?
Fuck no, but it's a waste of money.
Buy the camera, it's cheaper.
Alright.
1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call.
We have time for a couple of calls here tonight.
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
That's all one word.
You can call us right now.
The Skype line is open.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
Hey, Ranma, how you doing?
Pretty good.
Tired from this weekend, but other than that, I'm doing all right.
So, you know, I got pictures on my cell phone from you this weekend, so I know what this means.
Ranma went to another con yet again.
And I have a surprise.
I want you to take a look at this picture I just posted in the chat room.
Okay.
You might call him a con man.
No, I'm a con whore.
I was dressed up as Ranma and people were stopping for my picture half the time
That's a very nice, cool little outfit though.
Oh, I'm looking at the gallery though at the bottom of this page.
There's somebody dressed as Kirby.
That looks cute.
It's actually somebody tall, but the costume is designed where they can just sit down inside it and roll around, kind of, sort of.
That's a cute little Kirby.
Okay, now you've got me ogling these pictures of cosplay.
I mean, how was the con?
And of course, you know, the gaming components of it.
Were there lots of gaming cosplay at the con?
Actually, no, and when it comes to gaming, what is this gaming that you speak of?
What do you mean?
There was only one game at the convention.
Wow, what was that?
Ubisoft's Naruto 2 for Xbox 360.
Of course, because that ties directly back into anime.
Yeah, they had like two big screens up for demo play.
That was the only game that they had.
That's a cool little Kingdom Hearts cosplay.
Where's the game room?
What's the game room?
I'm like, oh damn.
Sorry, I know this is horrible radio, but I'm looking at this Kingdom Hearts cosplay of somebody dressed up as a Heartless.
That's pretty awesome, actually.
I've seen a few of those running around.
So not a lot of gaming content at this convention.
Is it just because they just want to brandish themselves as strictly, you know, it is an anime festival after all.
They just want to be strictly anime and nothing else?
No, there's no general rule.
I guess it's just what people wanted.
It was just mostly, I really didn't see a lot of cosplay myself.
And I was in the dealer's room in the thicket of it all.
That's kind of weird though because it looks like there was quite a bit of gaming cosplay for a con that didn't really have gaming.
GoFig, you know?
Oh, that's cool.
There's a whole little trio there dressed up like the Whirlwinds with you, those characters.
That's kind of neat.
Huh.
So, good con?
Fun time?
It was an improvement over last year's, but it could have been better.
I walked in, and I'm like, where's the con?
I'm like, it's downstairs in the basement where it was last year.
And I'm thinking, since there was no digital life, it's going to be upstairs like Comic-Con was, but it wasn't.
Oh, this was the convention that goes on the same time as Digital Life?
Yes.
Oh, so Digital Life would have happened this past weekend.
Yes.
Oh, interesting.
Alright, well, anything else you want to say about the convention before we get some more calls?
Only thing that really annoyed me is that you have to pay extra for concerts and autographs.
I mean, to get Almanos autographed was $60.
What?
That's a little weird.
I haven't heard of cons doing that before.
They get away with it, though?
Yeah, comic book conventions are known for doing it, but not anime conventions.
But since I could not get Jamie her autograph, I got her a little gift to really cheer her up.
And I'm posting a picture of it in the chat room right now.
It has something to do with one of her all-time favorite movies.
I'm going to look right now, too.
Ha!
That's great.
That's great.
What is it?
Winchester Tavern?
Did you see Shaun of the Dead?
Oh my god, okay.
Wow.
I bought three of those.
That is kind of randomly awesome.
That is so sweet.
Where the hell did you find that at an anime con?
It was on a dealer's table with shirts.
You know, they're actually showing it today at cosplay now, so why not?
Yeah, I saw that at a couple other cons I've been to.
You know, they had Shaun of the Dead on the big screen in San Francisco not that long ago.

Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.
It is he who likes to whore a bunch of time in live shows and podcasts.
Yeah, I was going to say, you were just on Bobby's show like three hours ago.
No, that's all right.
We welcome you to our program, especially with all the work you've done for our show.
How can we not have you on the program?
And you have a good radio voice, so I have something good to say.
So what does he want to say tonight, Jason?
I was kind of offended by Loki's remarks going, I'm not just whoring time, I'm whoring time about the exact same thing all over again.
I have to take some offense to what Loki was saying about Fable 2 and all that nonsense.
I'm sorry, say that again?
Loki's developers are lazy, Fable 2, no online co-op immediately, this, that, and the other.
I have to take a little bit of offense to that.
Why is that?
developers are not lazy and maybe it's a bit of respect that I'm getting out of the fact that I work at a job that has a lot of developers and when things don't go right and you find out about them it becomes a losing situation no matter what you try to do you either cut the feature out you push the product back you release it in a hodgepodge and everybody complains and you fix it again
It's no simple matter, and developers typically aren't lazy.
Lazy developers are the people who make big rigs.
Besides that and New World Order, those people don't really exist in the software industry that means anything.
Jason, what about the fact that this was one of the biggest things that they were pushing in this game and now it's not there anymore?
That to me is kind of what makes it what they're doing here newsworthy.
If it had been just a little feature, I bet most of us wouldn't have blinked an eye at it.
But this is a pretty big thing that they were selling in the game and now they've just basically said, well, it's not really going to be there the first day.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah, and the game was really big and the engine to power it too.
You have to have the game before you have the online component.
And if they had detrimental lag, rendering issues, or anything.
I haven't even read into the details, but just on a purely... I don't even know what the word is.
Just on a purely basic level, things don't go perfectly as planned.
How long have they had this release date?
that they're going to make because they're going to finish without this feature.
Why not push the release date two weeks back to give us all the features?
basically what it boils down to is there's no right or wrong way to do it but no matter what you do if you don't have a perfect product and nobody does if you don't have a perfect product it's a no-win situation something as big as this is definitely worse but it's a no-win situation to the developers who try and try and try and make one of these decisions because they're trying to make things better for their consumers
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
BigRig's New World Order like I said there are definitely the examples but those people who are that blatant go away never to be heard from again and we laugh them on the way out well not really because I mean look at like EA a lot of their recent sports games have had pretty bad problems in them
and Mercenaries 2.
I have to keep going back to this but seriously, oh my god.
There is no way that these glitches, they couldn't have caught this stuff because I run into them so often in this game.
Anybody playtesting this stuff through would have run into at least a dozen of these each time.
Just to say though, sometimes I gotta, just in defense of people who QA games because I know we have a lot of them that actually listen to this show.
Sometimes they find these bugs and they report back and their superiors just don't care.
It's kind of one of those things where it's like we don't have the time to fix it.
Okay, well then, either way, it looks bad on the publishing company then.
Jason, any other thoughts on this?
I have spent my time.
I do have to echo SSJ100 Matt, though.
I did play NHL 08, the demo at least, but I'm sure that was indicative enough of the actual game.
and I had pucks going through the ice and I had a lot of funny things happening.
NHL 09 has been pretty solid so far.
I'm definitely enjoying that.
I think it's the first sports game.
It's a simulation that I like.
Even better than Blades of Steel?
Like I said, simulation.
Everything else of that age was arcade style.
This is actually a sim that I'm thoroughly enjoying.
Fair enough, fair enough.
All right, well, Jason, we're going to let you go so we can try and get one more call.
But thanks, of course, for the call and the insight.
We appreciate it.
Good night.
All right, have a good one.
Bye.
All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
If you'd like to give us a call, we'll probably take like one more call and then call it a night here at Orange Lounge Radio and get to wrapping up the show.
Real quick, though, while we wait for the call, do we have any last-minute stories?
GameStop store their consoles in their bathroom
Ew.
Well, I heard this also from that, was it that Zero... I don't remember.
The guy that was mimicking Zero Punctuation, but bashing GameStop.
He said the same thing about consoles in the bathroom, and now they had video of it.
And it got taken down off of YouTube, apparently.
Hmm.
First of all, and I can say this from my experience with being in a number of game stops in the area, sometimes they're given such little storage space they actually have no choice but to put things in the bathroom.
But if anyone is urinating or defecating on the console, I would definitely think there'd be a way to tell by the box it's contained in.
So...
What smells in here?
Must be something the Sony's putting in the PlayStation.
I think there's absolutely no problem with them keeping a console in the bathroom.
As long as, you know, it's kept away from the toilet and sink, it's fine.
If they need the storage space, they need the storage space.
I just don't understand why a GameStop as a company, though, can't just, I don't know, spend some of that $7.5 billion that you're making or whatever and maybe... Two words.
Bottom line.
as long as no one's dipping their balls on them that's the most important thing next time I go buy a console it's a feature, what?
alright Luke, we've got somebody on hold on the line, I want to get to him hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
hey there Orange Lounge Radio, this is Deekman hey Deekman, what's on your mind buddy?
Oh, not a lot.
I just wanted to pimp a game that I don't think I've really heard anybody talking about the last couple of weeks.
Oh, please, by all means.
Da Blob for Wii.
I don't know if you guys have seen this game, but it's awesome.
I've been playing it pretty much all day, and it's freaking fantastic.
I know I saw it at PAX.
I watched Loki play it at PAX, actually.
You remember the Blob game where you were painting the walls different colors?
Yeah, it was alright.
I've just been loving it.
It feels like playing Katamari Damacy.
It just gives me that same feeling of just a fun time.
Awesome.
So that's kind of what makes this game to you?
Because keep in mind, we only saw a few minutes of it at an expo.
We can't really form a full opinion on the game based on that.
So is it just the fun factor?
What kind of stuff do you do in this game?
What makes it so fun?
Basically, you just play as a gelatinous blob that can take on different colors, and then you roll around the city, and every time you touch a building or an object, it just explodes with color.
And you start off in a completely black and white, desolate world, and then you start touching buildings, and the whole city just comes to life.
It's really quite impressive, especially for a third-party Wii title.
That was that one that we saw at PAX, right?
Yeah, I don't remember if you were there.
I think you were elsewhere on the show.
I was there.
I grabbed the little comic book that came out with it.
That was lots of fun.
I really am interested in that one.
So you literally get to paint the town red, as Frisbee says in chat.
Yeah, pretty much.
It's great.
Seriously, check it out if you get the chance.
Nice.
Okay, well, we might have to check that out.
Is it only on Wii, or did they put it on other systems?
No, it's only on Wii, but like I said, it is easily the best third-party Wii title I've ever seen.
Huh.
Very cool.
Well, anything else you've been playing you want to share with us?
Somebody Amigo for the Wii.
How'd that turn out?
What's that?
How did that game turn out?
Because I've been curious to pick it up, but there's just so much other stuff I'm playing right now.
I haven't had a chance.
The controls are kind of here and there.
They're really touchy, but I think that once you play with it for a couple of hours, you really get the idea of how to control the game.
But that's really the only problem I've had with it.
The track list is fantastic.
Yeah, I'm enjoying it.
Very cool.
Huh.
All right.
Have you had fun posing in Samba de Amigo?
That's the most important part.
Oh yeah, and the hustle mode?
Fantastic.
They really beefed it up.
I'll play that mode more than the regular mode.
Awesome.
Alright, well thanks so much for the call, Dekeman.
We gotta go and wrap up the show.
Yep, no worries.
Take care, guys.
Have a good one.
DarkSakura?
My last minute story is I like pie.
That's not a story.
I do have one more.
Remember I talked about last week the Wii ISO loader that got leaked out and then the guy making it when it...
Looks like a Wenny Coco or something like that.
Wen and Coco.
You know, basically he was pissed off about the leak or something like that.
And so he's like, well, you know, I'm not going to work on it anymore.
And then later on the week, well, maybe I'll work on it some more.
Well, I missed the attention, so.
Yeah, maybe I'll finish it now, so.
So yeah, ISO litter may be coming at some point.
Hooray!
Okay, well, if there's no other last minute stories, then we're going to go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thought and try to wrap up tonight's show.
We'll start off with Tiara.
Thanks so much for joining us here tonight.
I hope you had fun.
And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
No.
No.
No.
Just a simple no.
Well, have a safe flight back to Las Vegas and come see us again.
I definitely will.
Thank you.
Awesome.
Loki, your final thought tonight.
My final thought is I went this weekend and played Airsoft, and it was fun.
So my gun, I have the P90 or whatever.
I have these 300-round clips.
And I hated having to run out of ammo and change clips and stuff.
It just was inconvenient.
So I bought a...
1500 round box magazine for it now.
I will never run out of ammo.
Ever.
Goodie, goodie.
Just don't bring that to the studio.
I will bring it to the studio one of these days.
Because somebody's going to get shot, especially if another Dance Hero argument breaks out.
Which I'm surprised did not come up on Skype tonight.
The Dance Hero thing.
Maybe next week.
Maybe we'll get some emails.
My final thought would be I had a bite of John's Chinese food and it was really good.
It was really good because I haven't had deep fried chicken in a long time.
And a nice little humanized Mega Man picture there that DarkSakura is showing me.
This is going to be my final thought.
Okay, then what is your final thought?
Everyone needs to go look at Masao's artwork.
It's at www.5c.biglobe.ne.jp You are going to post that in chat, right?
I am.
That's a long ass link.
It's basically this guy that does weird video game art and kind of scary Ronald McDonald art, but he does Mario and Luigi.
Wow.
I'm interested in the scary Ronald McDonald art.
The artist is Masao, M-A-S-A-O.
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
Well, if you didn't have a pen and paper to write down that link fast enough, and sadly you weren't in chat tonight, you should come join us for a live show sometime.
