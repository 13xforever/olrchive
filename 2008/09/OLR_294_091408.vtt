00:00.000 --> 00:19.920
Today, September 14th, 2008, could a Wii storage problem solution finally be coming?

00:19.920 --> 00:24.960
The Mortal Kombat vs. DC roster leaks thanks to its achievements, and the first details

00:24.960 --> 00:27.000
emerge on DJ Hero.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.400
Hello, everybody out there on the internets, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.400 --> 00:36.400
Radio.

00:36.400 --> 00:40.800
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:40.800 --> 00:41.800
lifestyle.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.800
It's where every gamer has a voice, including you guys when you join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.760
But the voices you'll probably hear most are myself, Rob Roberts, and with me as always,

00:50.760 --> 00:52.720
the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.720
Hi.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.360
How you doing, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
I'm here.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
Almost like your new name.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.360
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?

00:58.360 --> 00:59.360
Not really, though.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.720
Um, just don't call me Bob.

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
Okay, Bob.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.360
All right, also joining us tonight.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.280
You know what, Rob?

01:05.280 --> 01:09.000
Returning after being on vacation last week, I don't know who told him he could take a

01:09.000 --> 01:13.720
week off, but apparently he took it upon himself to take a week off after being so exhausted

01:13.720 --> 01:15.920
from Penny Arcade Expo, it's Techmaster Loki.

01:15.920 --> 01:16.920
Hey.

01:16.920 --> 01:17.920
So what was it?

01:17.920 --> 01:18.920
The day job kept you away, right?

01:18.920 --> 01:19.920
Yeah.

01:19.920 --> 01:20.920
I had to go to San Francisco.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.000
Oh, you poor thing.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.040
You had to get bought fancy dinners by the company, I'm sure, huh?

01:25.040 --> 01:26.040
Yes.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.240
You poor, poor thing.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.520
Any game-related things you saw?

01:28.520 --> 01:31.480
Oh, you probably can't talk about them, even if you did, huh?

01:31.480 --> 01:32.480
I, no.

01:32.480 --> 01:38.080
I didn't, I, no, everything there is just, like, like company-related stuff.

01:38.080 --> 01:43.760
They, I mean, they mentioned a few, like, release seats for movies that, you know, I

01:43.760 --> 01:44.760
don't know.

01:44.760 --> 01:45.760
But nothing.

01:45.760 --> 01:46.760
But nothing.

01:46.760 --> 01:47.760
There's no game stuff.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.360
They, they just, like, oh yeah, I'm gonna do a game soon.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.080
It's more of an afterthought.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.080
It's all movie stuff.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.080
A little bit.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.000
I gave everyone a $1,500 trip to one of ten locations.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh, poor thing.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.520
Well, that's just $1,500.

02:02.520 --> 02:07.880
You have to book your own trip, so that may cover your flight, and that's about it.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.080
We could go to, what, Fresno?

02:10.080 --> 02:11.080
On that?

02:11.080 --> 02:12.080
No, it's one of ten locations.

02:12.080 --> 02:20.240
So it's either Hawaii, Hollywood, Seattle, somewhere in Arizona, I forget what it was.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.160
Can you save it for next year and go to Seattle next year?

02:22.160 --> 02:24.200
By the end of 2009.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.280
And no, I'm not going to PAX next year for that.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.320
I'm not using it for PAX, no.

02:29.320 --> 02:37.640
There's San Antonio, Chicago, Boston, New York City, and Orlando.

02:37.640 --> 02:38.960
So lots, lots of neat places.

02:38.960 --> 02:39.960
Oh, and Hawaii.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.560
You said Hawaii.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.600
Stop rubbing it in.

02:43.600 --> 02:48.000
And then I found out the other day, because this was originally only being offered to

02:48.000 --> 02:59.280
our movie sales, we're going to be probably getting a 42-inch Sony Bravia Plasma TV through

02:59.280 --> 03:00.280
some deal.

03:00.280 --> 03:04.480
Basically, our video reps are selling some Sony product, and the goals seem reasonable,

03:04.480 --> 03:07.080
so probably by Christmas, I'll have another TV.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.600
Let me know when they're hiring, okay?

03:09.600 --> 03:10.600
Good luck.

03:10.600 --> 03:16.120
Our company, trust me, it sounds good, and if you're movie sales, you're probably making

03:16.120 --> 03:18.080
out pretty good, but everyone else is not.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.240
An orange job radio here on all games radio tonight.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.800
All right, let's get, let's shift.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
But, oh, wait, wait, wait.

03:24.800 --> 03:29.440
I was going to say, just taking it back to the gaming, though, I did go to Japan town,

03:29.440 --> 03:36.320
and I picked up a pillow shaped like a question block from Mario Brothers, so they're hanging

03:36.320 --> 03:38.520
in my desk just like a question block would be.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.720
They wouldn't let me hang it from the ceiling, so I had to put it under my shelf.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.360
I was going to say, when you get frustrated, would you just go, boing, and get it?

03:45.360 --> 03:48.480
Well, if I hate it, it knocks it off, but that's fine.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.640
And then I also bought, because I used to do and collect Gundam figures, they had armored

03:53.640 --> 03:57.680
core figures, so I picked up one of those, I'm going to build that, so that's kind of

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
cool.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.680
But lots of game stuff there.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.200
Now, I remember seeing at Dark Soccer's house something very similar to the question mark

04:02.200 --> 04:03.200
block.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.680
She has a goomba, and you can actually hit it, and it makes a little squishy sound when

04:06.680 --> 04:07.680
you hit it.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.640
Yes, they had a bunch of Yoshi's there, and a bunch of Yoshi eggs, but I didn't want any

04:11.640 --> 04:14.400
of those, because Yoshi's like Jar Jar.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
All right.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.920
Yoshi is not Jar Jar.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.880
He's the Jar Jar of the Mario World.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.880
He is not.

04:19.880 --> 04:20.880
Yoshi's awesome.

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
Jar Jar was Jar Jar.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.200
You did not even in the same league.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
How dare you?

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
All right.

04:25.200 --> 04:31.640
Let's get into some actual video gaming, besides the whole Yoshi debate, and talk a little

04:31.640 --> 04:33.680
bit about your gaming week, Dark Sakura.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.880
How was your gaming week?

04:35.880 --> 04:42.280
It wasn't, because I haven't had a chance to really play much other than Ragnarok.

04:42.280 --> 04:48.480
But I did open my copy of The World Ends With You, and I'm going to be starting it, so that's

04:48.480 --> 04:50.360
some progress, right?

04:50.360 --> 04:51.360
Yes.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.920
Sometimes opening the box can be a day-long chore in itself, for real, the way they wrap

04:55.920 --> 04:56.920
them.

04:56.920 --> 04:57.920
No, no, no, no, no.

04:57.920 --> 04:58.920
I played Salamander.

04:58.920 --> 04:59.920
Oh, how was that?

04:59.920 --> 05:03.640
Because I picked up the Salamander pack for Dan on PSP, and it was pretty cool.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.640
Very cool.

05:04.640 --> 05:05.640
And, and, and, and, and.

05:05.640 --> 05:06.640
And?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.040
I downloaded a ROM for puzzle and dusted, so I can play it again.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.920
Ah, our classic game of the week last week.

05:10.920 --> 05:11.920
Yep.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.200
Now, Salamander, um, was Life Force here in the US, kind of.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.200
Yes.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.200
Kind of.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.200
Right?

05:18.200 --> 05:19.200
Because it was a lot more difficult, if I remember right.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
I think I've played the Salamander arcade game.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.200
They were both pretty freaking hard.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.120
But Life Force was kind of easy, from what I remember.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.400
Life Force was still kind of difficult.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.680
I mean, I wouldn't say it was our type hard, but it was pretty tough.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.960
Didn't it have a 30 lives code or something, or at least it had the up, up, down, down,

05:31.960 --> 05:32.960
like you could get all the power-ups?

05:32.960 --> 05:33.960
Yeah.

05:33.960 --> 05:34.960
Okay.

05:34.960 --> 05:35.960
I think that made it easier.

05:35.960 --> 05:40.440
GS68 wants to know, was it one or two Salamander?

05:40.440 --> 05:42.200
I got the deluxe pack.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
The first one.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.200
Ah.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.200
There you go.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.200
The both games pack.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.200
Cool.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.200
Alright.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.200
Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:49.200 --> 05:53.320
Pretty good, because I have a lot of weeks to catch up on, but I didn't play that much.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.840
I played, let's see, Mercenaries 2.

05:56.840 --> 06:02.120
I got that slightly before it came out, and I've been playing it a little bit.

06:02.120 --> 06:10.200
I can say, I haven't played the first Mercenaries game, but damn, number 2 is seriously broken.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.400
But it's broken in an amusing way.

06:12.400 --> 06:18.920
Like, for example, some of the physics in it are kind of wonky, like you can tap a tree

06:18.920 --> 06:25.000
with a motorcycle and it explodes, and pretty much there's nothing you can do as far as

06:25.000 --> 06:28.120
sitting in a car that's about to explode to hurt yourself.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.920
I mean, if your car explodes while you happen to be in it, you'll take a little bit of damage,

06:31.920 --> 06:34.060
and that's about it.

06:34.060 --> 06:38.800
I was walking around an enemy camp and I hit a barbell and it kicked it like a soccer ball,

06:38.800 --> 06:43.120
which is kind of funny, and then there was one part where I was playing it and I got

06:43.120 --> 06:46.680
injured to the point where I was about to die, and when you die, your screen starts

06:46.680 --> 06:51.680
to kind of blink red and you hear your heart beat and stuff.

06:51.680 --> 06:57.840
Well, it stayed like that, and so I was invulnerable, and any vehicle I got in, I was invincible

06:57.840 --> 07:02.280
in as well, until I turned the game off.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.280
So that was fun.

07:03.280 --> 07:07.200
And then they have a nice glitch with one of the little side missions you can do the

07:07.200 --> 07:12.840
bet money on to actually make money off of, where they have a maximum where you can only

07:12.840 --> 07:20.840
make $5 million per bet, but the problem is, though, is the minimum is calculated off of

07:20.840 --> 07:24.880
the amount of money that you have, and the minimum doesn't have a cap to it, so you can

07:24.880 --> 07:31.200
keep playing this game until you have a $50 million minimum and a maximum of $5 million,

07:31.200 --> 07:33.200
so that's kind of broken, too.

07:33.200 --> 07:38.840
It's just, the whole game's kind of broken, but I guess it's kind of fun.

07:38.840 --> 07:43.240
Then of course, I played More Grand Theft Auto IV, I'm on a two-week winning streak

07:43.240 --> 07:51.200
now with our company group, so that was fun, and I played Spore, and it's kind of boring.

07:51.200 --> 07:56.120
I'm not too far into it, I'm to the tribe stage right now, but I haven't really actually

07:56.120 --> 08:02.800
played the tribe stage yet, but the cell and creature stages are quite boring, and I hope

08:02.800 --> 08:08.520
the rest of the game's not like that, but so far I'm very unimpressed by the graphics,

08:08.520 --> 08:11.080
I'm very unimpressed by the gameplay.

08:11.080 --> 08:16.080
It just looks like a game that should have been out like years ago, I don't know.

08:16.080 --> 08:23.140
And then Rock Band 2, I was lucky enough to get that a little early, so I've been playing

08:23.140 --> 08:25.480
quite a bit of Rock Band 2 actually.

08:25.480 --> 08:32.920
We have a fellow worker at my company that plays quite a bit of Rock Band, and so he's

08:32.920 --> 08:37.960
been playing it along with me, and we started a band in there, and one of the random names

08:37.960 --> 08:43.360
they gave us was Unfit Barf Bags, so we stuck with it, and I made a cool logo and stuff,

08:43.360 --> 08:44.720
and so we've been playing that.

08:44.720 --> 08:49.920
I actually bought the Mad Catz Precision Bass that they have for it, and that controller's

08:49.920 --> 08:50.920
fucking awesome.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.440
It has like a little double strum.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.320
Whoa, wait, did you just say Mad Catz and Awesome in the same sentence?

08:55.320 --> 08:56.320
I know.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.320
I know.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.320
Wow.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.320
Well, their Rock Band stuff's actually pretty good.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.320
It really...

09:00.320 --> 09:01.320
Pinch me.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.320
Seriously.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.320
I must be dreaming.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.320
I know.

09:04.320 --> 09:08.920
I mean, eventually this is bound to happen, but no, it actually is a pretty good controller.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.880
What's next, a DDR mat that won't break after a week?

09:11.880 --> 09:12.880
I don't know about that.

09:12.880 --> 09:13.880
Surely you jest.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.840
But the Rock Band stuff though, they're doing some good stuff with that.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.700
I have to preface this real fast, I'm sorry.

09:18.700 --> 09:22.800
If you don't know why people always kind of joke about Mad Catz and you know how all their

09:22.800 --> 09:26.320
stuff is broken, like, I don't know, for me, it dates back to the days that we used to

09:26.320 --> 09:27.320
cover DDR, right?

09:27.320 --> 09:30.040
Like, I don't know, Dark Soccer, did you ever own a Mad Catz pad?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.040
No.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.040
With $20 pads?

09:32.040 --> 09:33.040
Have you heard about them, Shirley?

09:33.040 --> 09:37.160
I did, but I remember what I used to say, I would never buy anything knockoff.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.440
Yeah, exactly.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.440
And they were like the $20 dance pads, so everybody was like, yay, cheap dance pad.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.280
Well, they would break after like a week.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.280
They were definitely made with $20 parts.

09:45.280 --> 09:51.320
At least with the Rock Band stuff, and I know that these are officially licensed products,

09:51.320 --> 09:56.960
and I mean, Mad Catz is in charge of making the cymbals that are gonna be optional for

09:56.960 --> 09:58.120
Rock Band 2.

09:58.120 --> 10:02.460
They're the only people that are making them, and this bass is something that they're starting

10:02.460 --> 10:07.800
to put out too, and it's actually put together a lot better than the controller is, the normal

10:07.800 --> 10:09.480
guitar controller that you can buy.

10:09.480 --> 10:14.240
So what makes it kind of unique, though, they have a thumb rest on it and a dual strummer.

10:14.240 --> 10:18.720
It's split down the middle, so you can kind of strum it like you would a bass guitar.

10:18.720 --> 10:23.460
The only thing I don't like about it, and I know you can't really whammy on a bass guitar,

10:23.460 --> 10:28.680
but the whammy bar is no longer a bar, it's a knob, and it's literally impossible unless

10:28.680 --> 10:31.720
you had a third arm to trigger it.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.680
I need to interject here, because I want to do a quick poll in our chat room, because

10:34.680 --> 10:37.080
I'm really, really curious about this before you finish this story.

10:37.080 --> 10:41.200
All right, and this is for the longtime music game fans only, of which I know we have many

10:41.200 --> 10:44.040
that listen to Orange Lawns Radio, because we've been doing this a while when we all

10:44.040 --> 10:45.640
started with DDR.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.320
Here's my quick poll question for chat, will you find it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz

10:50.320 --> 10:53.840
if this bass guitar thing is as awesome as Loki says it is?

10:53.840 --> 10:54.840
That's my quick poll.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.760
Do you have it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz?

10:56.760 --> 11:00.120
I also do have a comment that I don't see what the difference should be in the strum

11:00.120 --> 11:05.880
bar or not, because I always play the Guitar Hero ones strumming upwards and not downwards,

11:05.880 --> 11:07.960
because you play bass strumming upwards.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.280
But it's so that you can hit it faster if you want to.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.900
Yeah, I like that it's split in two.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.240
That is kind of cool, because you can use like two fingers.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.240
You walk it with your fingers on them.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.240
That would take some getting used to.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.440
It does take some getting used to, and it, I don't know.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.440
I like it though.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.440
It's really good.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.880
I'll read the reviews on it if you have any qualms about buying it.

11:26.880 --> 11:32.880
All the reviews have been extremely positive about it, so maybe it is a turn for the better.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.520
And then, let's see what else did I play.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.040
Wait, here's the results of our quick poll, all right.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.080
Can you find it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz?

11:40.080 --> 11:41.080
Polled it.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.480
Chat.orangeawnsradio.com, here we go.

11:42.480 --> 11:43.480
Fuck no.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.480
No.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.480
Never.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.480
Nope.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.480
Probably.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.480
No.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.480
Hell no.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.480
Never.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.480
I'm waiting for Hori to make a guitar con from GS68.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.480
Maybe.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.680
Perhaps, if the price is right, and that's because it has a better D-pad.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.920
I had a Mad Catz GameCube controller, and it was crap.

11:57.920 --> 11:58.920
There you go.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.640
The results of the quick poll.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.640
Okay.

12:01.640 --> 12:02.640
Resoundingly negative.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.040
I'd buy a Hori one.

12:04.040 --> 12:10.840
They're also supposed to be making, later on, full wood controllers for Rock Band.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.700
They're going to be actual, like, guitars.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.440
So I don't know.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.440
It's nice.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.600
Who wants to come over to my house to play Rock Band?

12:17.600 --> 12:18.600
I got wood.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.800
I was going to say, does that mean you have wood?

12:21.800 --> 12:27.280
The other thing I tried out were the PDP drum silencers.

12:27.280 --> 12:34.440
Now, I had tried some third-party, like the Rock Band, or it's like rockbanddrumsilencer.com

12:34.440 --> 12:35.440
or something like that.

12:35.440 --> 12:38.800
They're really cheap-ass, you know, foam shit.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.360
Well, these are the official ones that they actually sell in the stores for 20 bucks,

12:42.360 --> 12:44.040
and they work pretty good.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.200
I don't know.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.760
Did you play drums a little bit, Rob?

12:46.760 --> 12:49.880
Yeah, I played drums at your little thing when I came over.

12:49.880 --> 12:55.760
Did they work pretty good, the sensitivity on them?

12:55.760 --> 12:58.120
It could have been a little better, honestly.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.440
Some of the pads were better than others.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.720
Like, I noticed the red one.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.720
I had a lot of problems.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.000
That could, admittedly, it could be the way I drum.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.360
I'm not used to drumming.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.360
I don't claim to drum professionally.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.880
It could also be my drum set, because it's a first-generation one.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.280
Apparently, all the other ones, they've made more sensitive, so I don't know.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.640
But I thought it worked pretty well.

13:14.640 --> 13:15.640
I don't know.

13:15.640 --> 13:20.080
It beats being extremely loud with those, because it bugs everything.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.080
True.

13:21.080 --> 13:24.400
The volume is much more manageable with the little silencers on it.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.400
I don't know.

13:25.400 --> 13:30.160
I was trying to find the Rock Band 2 drum sets, which were supposedly out today, and

13:30.160 --> 13:32.660
apparently nobody knows that they're supposed to be out today.

13:32.660 --> 13:38.320
So EA just didn't ship anybody, because I went to Gamestop, which, I might add, Gamestop

13:38.320 --> 13:42.080
told me they were coming out today, and they said, oh yeah, we have some coming in for

13:42.080 --> 13:45.400
our pre-order customers, but we don't know how many extras they're gonna have.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.460
And then I come back to a different Gamestop, and they're all, what are you talking about?

13:48.460 --> 13:50.000
They're coming out in October.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.960
And I'm a liar!

13:51.960 --> 13:55.320
No, he was an idiot, is what he was.

13:55.320 --> 13:59.440
And I went to the Fry's, and they didn't know about it, and Best Buy said they're getting

13:59.440 --> 14:04.240
them later in the week, so I'm just assuming they didn't ship anybody, which, not surprising.

14:04.240 --> 14:11.620
But yeah, I need to get some of those new drums, because I want to plug in useless shit

14:11.620 --> 14:13.400
to them.

14:13.400 --> 14:18.320
And because my drum set will probably go to my sister eventually, so.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.320
That's it.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.840
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.200
Alright, my gaming week, kind of a lot of the same things that Matt's been talking about,

14:24.200 --> 14:25.200
so I don't want to repeat too bad.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.560
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, one more thing, sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.760
Castle Crashers, fucking awesome.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
That's it.

14:30.760 --> 14:31.760
Alright.

14:31.760 --> 14:35.440
I've been playing mostly Spore and Rock Band 2 as well.

14:35.440 --> 14:39.320
Although most of my Rock Band 2 was early, early this morning, because I went to a Walmart,

14:39.320 --> 14:41.880
which I usually don't shop at Walmart, but it was the only place that was doing it at

14:41.880 --> 14:44.040
midnight, so I was like, alright, I'll go.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.400
So I went into Walmart and, you know, just bought it.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.880
I had to wait around, because they didn't realize the game was coming out, but whatever,

14:49.880 --> 14:53.520
you know, I guess they're not used to games coming out on Sunday or something, although

14:53.520 --> 14:56.520
as Bobby pointed out- They're not used to working at Walmart at

14:56.520 --> 14:57.520
midnight.

14:57.520 --> 15:02.440
Well, no, actually, you know, I was going to try to defend them a little bit, you know,

15:02.440 --> 15:05.860
Be Devil's Advocate, but you might be right, because I was actually told they can't find

15:05.860 --> 15:09.440
the box right now because the guy's on break.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.120
So we had to sit around and wait for the guy to get back from break.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.800
So I finally got out of there about 1230 with Rock Band 2, but whatever, I got Rock Band,

15:15.800 --> 15:18.800
so the hell with it.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.880
So I've actually been enjoying Rock Band 1.5, as I've kind of been calling it, because a

15:22.880 --> 15:28.360
lot of it feels pretty much like Rock Band 1 with a newer, better song list.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.560
All the problems that you wish had been fixed in 1 are now fixed.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.800
For instance, you know, you can do a band tour mode by yourself.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.000
In fact, there is no more single player tour.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.640
It's just all the band world tour, and you know, it's kind of fun to make a sticker and

15:40.640 --> 15:41.640
stuff.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.640
And the online is much more comprehensive.

15:42.640 --> 15:46.520
You can do these battle of the bands where you're automatically, you know, playing against

15:46.520 --> 15:53.000
your friends list in a Geometry Wars 2 stylish way of taking over their scores, and you know,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.360
on these set lists that could be up for a week or a few hours.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.360
It's pretty crazy.

15:59.360 --> 16:05.920
So yeah, that's more rounded out online mode, but as far as like graphics and some of that,

16:05.920 --> 16:09.520
like the interface hasn't really changed at all.

16:09.520 --> 16:13.600
The models and everything are the exact same ones they had in Rock Band 1.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.960
The motion capturing was a lot better though, I think.

16:15.960 --> 16:16.960
Was it?

16:16.960 --> 16:19.800
It didn't even seem that different to me, to be honest.

16:19.800 --> 16:24.740
So it's a little bit Rock Band 1.5-ish to me, but then again, this is kind of where

16:24.740 --> 16:30.720
we're going with music games is it's a Madden all its own now, you know, to, you know, and

16:30.720 --> 16:36.560
you know, I say Rock Band 1.5 in somewhat, you know, in jest because, you know, obviously

16:36.560 --> 16:38.380
we've been playing DDR for years.

16:38.380 --> 16:41.480
We're used to this crap where it's pretty much the same game with new songs.

16:41.480 --> 16:46.360
But seriously though, if the best feature I think in this game is actually something

16:46.360 --> 16:52.780
that's part of Rock Band 1, which is a song export feature, that I think makes it stand

16:52.780 --> 16:58.780
out from Guitar Hero easy because now, if it were like DDR, you can take all your songs

16:58.780 --> 17:04.400
from the previous mixes and add them in to your next, you know, Rock Band 2, you know,

17:04.400 --> 17:08.720
you take all those songs from Rock Band 1, Rock Band 3 is going to have 2 and 1, so you're

17:08.720 --> 17:12.760
just going to get this ever-expanding song list and I think that's pretty cool.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.360
Yeah, no, I definitely agree.

17:14.360 --> 17:15.360
I think that's cool.

17:15.360 --> 17:19.100
I think that's one of the greatest things is just firing up a make-your-own set list

17:19.100 --> 17:23.720
type thing and you have like literally 150 songs to choose from because you have download

17:23.720 --> 17:28.680
songs, Rock Band 1 songs, Rock Band 2 songs, it's insane, but awesome.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.680
And then like, you know, playing a random set list or playing online when you have to

17:31.680 --> 17:35.600
play random songs, you get songs you forgot you had or songs you didn't know you even

17:35.600 --> 17:38.560
had to play, so that's kind of cool.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.720
Other games I've been playing this week, Spore, Spore, Spore, I bought Spore and I've been

17:41.720 --> 17:47.240
playing that, like Loki, I can't seem to get past the tribal phase, but it's because A,

17:47.240 --> 17:51.380
I have a quick attention span and B, I just kind of suck at it and the game doesn't give

17:51.380 --> 17:56.080
you a whole lot of help, so you kind of have to learn about the game yourself.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.760
And I find that when I get too frustrated, I want to go back and start from the beginning

17:59.760 --> 18:02.560
and try a bunch of things different I didn't do right the first time.

18:02.560 --> 18:05.520
That's kind of what I've been doing is like, you know, the first time I was trying to do

18:05.520 --> 18:09.040
an herbivore, make nice with everybody, but then I was like, you know what, fuck this,

18:09.040 --> 18:11.520
I want to be a carnivore and just eat everybody.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.120
So that's how I decided to play the second time around.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.720
The other thing I learned about Spore is that I really suck at making animals.

18:17.720 --> 18:21.040
I mean, don't get me wrong, the interface is really awesome.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.680
I love the creature creator.

18:22.680 --> 18:27.000
It really does make you feel like, you know, even if you don't know much about art or whatever,

18:27.000 --> 18:31.260
you can do some neat things just by basically clicking and moving the mouse in random directions.

18:31.260 --> 18:35.600
You can get these Picasso style animals that aren't that bad, but I still feel like I'm

18:35.600 --> 18:40.000
crap crappy at animal design, but that's just something I guess is learned with time because

18:40.000 --> 18:45.940
I kind of like, Loki, you had a creature that has like one ginormous eye, like a scorpion

18:45.940 --> 18:49.280
that showed up in my planet that was actually kind of cool looking.

18:49.280 --> 18:55.600
Oh yeah, it was supposed to be like a dog looking thing and the eye was its nose because

18:55.600 --> 18:56.600
it was black.

18:56.600 --> 19:01.080
It kind of looked, I called it spike and it had like a, my, my current creature, that's

19:01.080 --> 19:04.120
like a, a carnivore that just eats everything.

19:04.120 --> 19:10.840
It looks like a velociraptor, but with a giant, um, mouth, but it's like one of those, like,

19:10.840 --> 19:12.120
hello, my name is George.

19:12.120 --> 19:18.760
Like type of mouths, like, like, like, uh, you know, old, you know, pudgy guy mouth.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.600
I'm sorry, but like all the creatures in that game looks stupid.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.440
It's like even, even the ones I create, I'm like, wow, that looks dumb.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.840
Look at the stuff on Sporepedia though.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.640
There's some pretty impressive stuff in there.

19:27.640 --> 19:33.640
I mean, especially like what I do, I don't play with the internet random drops of animals

19:33.640 --> 19:35.560
because I'm sure there's a lot of crap in there.

19:35.560 --> 19:40.240
I only play with the Maxis ones, which you can't turn off and then my friends list.

19:40.240 --> 19:45.880
So either I see crappy things my friends made or I can see the cool looking Maxis ones.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.480
I should probably do that because there's been some really stupid things that came in.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.840
How many penis monsters have you seen in Spore?

19:50.840 --> 19:51.840
Zero.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.840
Really?

19:52.840 --> 19:53.840
Zero penis monsters.

19:53.840 --> 19:54.840
I haven't made one though myself.

19:54.840 --> 19:55.840
That's pretty impressive.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.840
I'm surprised.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.760
I get, well, can't you like report it or something if it happens?

19:58.760 --> 19:59.760
I don't know.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.760
See, that's the thing.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.200
I don't have to report it because I just want to, I was going to make a planet of penis

20:04.200 --> 20:07.080
monsters or something because that'd be funny.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.080
The one other thing I've been playing, I've been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the

20:10.080 --> 20:11.080
Lich King.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.080
I got into beta.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.880
I didn't really read the user and agreement, so I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say

20:15.880 --> 20:16.880
about it.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.360
Although I'm pretty sure most wild side has been talking pretty openly about it.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.760
I'm going to talk about everything about it.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.220
I honestly, what is there to talk about?

20:23.220 --> 20:26.720
It's been extremely laggy and very hard to kill things.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.040
I was like, Ooh, pretty new splash screens.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.040
Ooh, pretty new graphics.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.960
I'm on a pretty new continent.

20:31.960 --> 20:36.120
But that's about as much as I could see because it was very, very laggy, but it's a beta.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.280
It's free for me to play.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.680
I can't complain nor base a review off it.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.680
So what can you do?

20:40.680 --> 20:41.680
I can complain.

20:41.680 --> 20:46.060
Oh, I'd rather not complain because I realize it's a beta and it's free and it's not the

20:46.060 --> 20:47.800
finished product.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.160
But all I can say is that it's hard for me to get a feel for it.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.160
I will say this though.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.800
The new achievement system is kind of interesting.

20:53.800 --> 20:57.480
I noticed that now you have to have a Blizzard account and I think that's how it's going

20:57.480 --> 21:03.720
to tie to Diablo and Starcraft 2 and the other Blizzard franchises.

21:03.720 --> 21:08.920
And the game does pretty much know with some hit and miss accuracy what achievements you've

21:08.920 --> 21:10.160
already unlocked.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.800
I think it goes through your quest log and figures out what quests you've already done

21:13.800 --> 21:16.120
and therefore what achievements you must have beat.

21:16.120 --> 21:22.200
But when I first fired up my character on the beta and unlocked all the achievements

21:22.200 --> 21:28.240
you get from historical information, the game does not think I've ever run Slave Pens Heroic.

21:28.240 --> 21:32.840
And if you're a Warcraft player, you know that everybody has run Slave Pens Heroic a

21:32.840 --> 21:34.800
lot once you're at level 70.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.360
It's like free badges.

21:36.360 --> 21:41.260
So it still has some tweaking to do, but it's not bad.

21:41.260 --> 21:42.260
So anyway, that's it.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.520
I don't want to drag out gaming week too long.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.940
We're already like 20 minutes into the show.

21:44.940 --> 21:46.560
We got gaming news to get to.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.880
I'll really quickly save for housekeeping tonight.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.240
There's not an awful lot to say.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.240
Just a reminder.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.280
I'll be at E for All in a couple weeks.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.400
Sadly, Dark Soccer and Loki will not be joining me.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.160
But I'll be there hoping to meet some of you in the LA area that are going to come out

21:58.160 --> 21:59.160
for E for All.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.160
Look at All Games booth.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.860
It's supposed to be right out there on the main floor.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.360
It's going to be pretty awesome.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.840
I'm sure they'll say more about that on allgames.com.

22:05.840 --> 22:10.360
And that is the first weekend in October, the third through the fifth, if I'm not mistaken.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.760
I will be there in LA.

22:12.760 --> 22:18.220
Also, if you haven't already, check us out on Twitter at username OLR on Twitter.

22:18.220 --> 22:19.220
That's a new one.

22:19.220 --> 22:22.960
There's always our live journal at Orange Lounge, our Myspace at Orange Lounge Radio.

22:22.960 --> 22:23.960
And Facebook.

22:23.960 --> 22:24.960
Our name is the OLR me.

22:24.960 --> 22:25.960
That's right.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.160
Four different sites, four different names, just to confuse you further.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.160
All right.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.720
Let's get into the gaming news for tonight.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.720
We'll start off with Loki.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.560
What's going on in gaming news?

22:34.560 --> 22:38.880
Well, Nintendo has released a new peripheral for the Wii system.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.400
No, it's not a hard drive.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.860
It's a wireless router because I guess they phased out the little USB sticks that they

22:45.860 --> 22:48.640
had to use with your PC.

22:48.640 --> 22:55.880
And now this is its own standalone thing and will allow you to connect to, it's basically

22:55.880 --> 23:04.520
I guess like an ethernet bridge, and will allow you to connect your Wii to your router,

23:04.520 --> 23:06.960
to your wired network.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.960
I don't know.

23:07.960 --> 23:08.960
Do we really need this?

23:08.960 --> 23:12.160
Is this a replacement for the dongle they had, the USB stick that you had?

23:12.160 --> 23:14.560
Rob, you just said one of my favorite funny words.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.560
Dongle?

23:15.560 --> 23:16.560
Dongle.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.720
I'm going to make a spore creature and call it dongle.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.720
Dongle?

23:19.720 --> 23:20.720
Let me put it this way.

23:20.720 --> 23:21.720
Okay.

23:21.720 --> 23:22.720
I'll make one called balls.

23:22.720 --> 23:23.720
All right.

23:23.720 --> 23:24.720
You do that.

23:24.720 --> 23:29.920
It's an okay idea I guess to have a wireless router or a wireless bridge for whatever reason

23:29.920 --> 23:35.280
because say you want to connect your Wii to your wireless network.

23:35.280 --> 23:41.460
Well, the problem is for 53 bucks, it costs actually 5800 yen or $53 US, which is about

23:41.460 --> 23:42.800
the equivalent there.

23:42.800 --> 23:49.720
For 57 bucks, you could probably get yourself a wireless router and then all of your systems

23:49.720 --> 23:50.720
can use it.

23:50.720 --> 23:54.480
Oh, and it also works with DS as well.

23:54.480 --> 23:55.480
I don't know.

23:55.480 --> 24:00.680
Well, my thought is what exactly are you going to take your Wii online for that badly if

24:00.680 --> 24:02.160
you need one of these?

24:02.160 --> 24:04.160
To buy more virtual console games I guess?

24:04.160 --> 24:05.160
Yeah.

24:05.160 --> 24:09.440
I mean are there that many games that support, I guess Brawl and all that, but not a lot.

24:09.440 --> 24:14.080
This is just so your Wii can connect to the internet.

24:14.080 --> 24:21.120
This is basically a wireless router, but it's Nintendo branded and it looks like the Wii

24:21.120 --> 24:22.480
sort of.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.480
I don't know.

24:23.480 --> 24:28.600
I think it's a waste of time, but there's cheaper solutions out there.

24:28.600 --> 24:33.480
Say for example this is sitting next to your wired router, your Wii is, I mean they have

24:33.480 --> 24:39.560
$20 USB wired dongles that you can get to connect straight to it.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.560
Yeah, dongle.

24:40.560 --> 24:44.040
I mean it beats paying $53.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.040
I don't know.

24:45.040 --> 24:49.800
I don't really think this is a problem for a lot of people to connect wirelessly to their

24:49.800 --> 24:50.800
network or something.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.000
Just buy a new router.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.840
AlphaKananagram in chat says this does allow PCs.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.760
It's a router for PCs as well.

24:58.760 --> 25:04.800
Well that's awesome, but once again I would rather that you bought just a normal router.

25:04.800 --> 25:05.800
Buy a Linksys or something.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.000
But is it pretty?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
That's the important question.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.760
Linksys are not that pretty white with the blue lights.

25:11.760 --> 25:16.440
It's white and they have a little stand that makes it stand up just like the Wii, but it,

25:16.440 --> 25:19.460
I mean, I don't know.

25:19.460 --> 25:23.240
I guess this is gonna appeal to the same people that like, you know, Macs, you know, pretty

25:23.240 --> 25:24.960
but useless.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.840
Hey Jamie, dongle.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.760
Who knows?

25:30.760 --> 25:33.600
This may never come out over here.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.720
Oh, by the way though, if you are interested in this and you want to get it and you live

25:37.720 --> 25:41.400
in Japan, it will be coming out on the 18th.

25:41.400 --> 25:49.160
Alright, moving on to more hardware possibly, but not a hard drive according to Reggie Fils-Aime

25:49.160 --> 25:52.360
who spoke to the Nintendo magazine Club Nintendo.

25:52.360 --> 25:55.440
That's the Latin American magazine translated.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.000
Reggie actually said, quote, we are working on a storage solution.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.960
We have never said that it will be a hard drive, nor have we mentioned how we will fix

26:01.960 --> 26:02.960
this issue.

26:02.960 --> 26:06.160
We are going to deliver a better way to store the games.

26:06.160 --> 26:10.080
You might remember I got really pissed off when this guy over at Nintendo Europe referred

26:10.080 --> 26:14.520
to everybody that wanted this storage solution as Geeks and Otaku.

26:14.520 --> 26:17.940
It was what they wanted and I thought that was a completely idiotic thing to have one

26:17.940 --> 26:21.440
of your representatives saying that and I said, you know what, screw Nintendo, I'm not

26:21.440 --> 26:25.760
going to buy anything online until they fix this problem and yes, I know I could copy

26:25.760 --> 26:29.480
things to the SD card and copy them back, but I don't want to.

26:29.480 --> 26:34.520
I shouldn't have to go through that because A, it's slow and B, why can't it just read

26:34.520 --> 26:35.520
off the SD card?

26:35.520 --> 26:36.840
It could use some type of cache or something.

26:36.840 --> 26:37.840
I don't know.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.840
It can't be that difficult.

26:38.840 --> 26:39.840
This worries me.

26:39.840 --> 26:40.840
I'm sorry.

26:40.840 --> 26:41.840
Why?

26:41.840 --> 26:45.840
This statement worries me because they're trying to think up a solution that's a creative

26:45.840 --> 26:48.180
solution to this.

26:48.180 --> 26:52.040
Why go the elaborate route when you can just go the easy route and make it so that it will

26:52.040 --> 26:55.640
work with USB hard drives or USB flash drives or something like that?

26:55.640 --> 26:59.720
They're going to try to do something stupid like network storage where they'll just basically

26:59.720 --> 27:03.680
store the game on their server and you'll have a key and you'll have to download it

27:03.680 --> 27:05.640
every time you want to play it or something like that.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.200
They're going to do something retarded like this.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.200
I know it.

27:08.200 --> 27:14.760
Well, here's my thought is that Wii 2, just like they've done a DS and a DS Lite, they'll

27:14.760 --> 27:15.760
release a Wii 2.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.400
They should give us a dongle.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.400
The increased storage and possibly a dongle attachment.

27:20.400 --> 27:28.440
It needs to have a dongle attachment that leads to Bluetooth to a separate hard drive.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.440
Don't get me wrong.

27:29.440 --> 27:34.760
I mean, they had some innovative ideas when they first put out the Wii, but all ideas

27:34.760 --> 27:39.840
since that haven't been that innovative and actually have been kind of a step backwards.

27:39.840 --> 27:40.840
Let's see.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.480
We had, well, what are we going to do for shooter games?

27:43.480 --> 27:44.480
I know.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.840
Let's release a plastic shell.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.100
What are we going to do for driving games?

27:47.100 --> 27:48.100
I know.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.100
Let's release a plastic shell.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.000
What are we going to do for storage?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
I know.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Let's do something stupid.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I mean, that's what's going to happen.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.200
I can just see Reggie at next E3 coming out to introduce Wii Plus or Wii 2.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.200
Look at this.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.200
It's holographic storage.

28:02.200 --> 28:05.720
With his increased storage space and his massive dongle.

28:05.720 --> 28:06.720
Look at this.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.520
It will come with it.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.640
I can see it now.

28:09.640 --> 28:10.640
It's Rob the Robot.

28:10.640 --> 28:14.440
He stores your data by stacking blocks or something really retarded.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.800
He shoves it all in his dongle.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.800
Think about that.

28:17.800 --> 28:22.440
Wouldn't that be cool if they made, like, a little USB storage device like Rob the Robot?

28:22.440 --> 28:23.440
No, it won't happen.

28:23.440 --> 28:29.120
I always thought they should release a miniature Rob the Robot that plugs into your DS and

28:29.120 --> 28:30.120
game right now.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.400
That plugs into his ass slot.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.400
I'm sorry.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.440
It's like those bikes on South Park.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.560
I don't know if you ever...

28:36.560 --> 28:37.560
Forget it.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.920
All they're saying is, I mean, don't say that you have a better idea of how to store data

28:41.920 --> 28:43.800
because so far it has not worked.

28:43.800 --> 28:49.120
I mean, your stupid archaic system of blocks is retarded, all right?

28:49.120 --> 28:53.320
Use actual data that everybody uses, you know, kilobytes.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.880
That's something that people are familiar nowadays.

28:55.880 --> 28:59.880
People aren't, like, going, oh, it's a mystical device that connects through the Internet

28:59.880 --> 29:01.000
via magic.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.260
I mean, people aren't that dumb.

29:03.260 --> 29:08.920
They do have a rudimentary understanding of how computers work, all right?

29:08.920 --> 29:14.960
And to be honest, if they don't understand storage and stuff and what kilobytes mean,

29:14.960 --> 29:15.960
guess what?

29:15.960 --> 29:20.080
Maybe they'll learn to, you know, figure out what this is via their Wii.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.680
I mean, that's a great idea.

29:21.680 --> 29:26.480
Instead, no, we're going to make it, we're just going to pander to the idiots and figure

29:26.480 --> 29:27.480
out a way to do that.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.680
Thank you, GS68, Wild Wacky Action Bike.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.800
I'm waiting for that attachment to come out on Wii, just so you know.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.880
I'm telling you, man, whatever it's going to be, I'm just ready for a disappointment.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.640
We need Wild Wacky Action Bike Wii.

29:40.640 --> 29:46.280
It would sell like crazy, and you know it.

29:46.280 --> 29:50.800
It's seriously, whatever they're going to announce at E3 is just going to be a disappointment.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.800
All right.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.800
But we are getting a dongle, right?

29:54.800 --> 29:55.800
We might.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.920
They're going to, seriously, they're going to be like, we've been working on this for

29:57.920 --> 30:01.200
years, and it's a Nintendo-branded SD card.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.200
Fuck yourselves.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.200
Bye.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.360
Well, we'll see what happens.

30:06.360 --> 30:10.480
I don't plan on any of my stupid little boycott just yet, because most stuff I want that's

30:10.480 --> 30:13.960
been coming out on Wii lately, namely the Strong Bad Games, have also been coming out

30:13.960 --> 30:14.960
on PC.

30:14.960 --> 30:15.960
Problem fixed.

30:15.960 --> 30:20.440
Well, I'm still going to be downloading Choaniki behind my husband's back.

30:20.440 --> 30:24.160
Ooh, I like Charan's comment, a Wild Wacky Action Dongle.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.160
Ooh!

30:25.160 --> 30:27.120
That could be like an OLR dream game.

30:27.120 --> 30:30.640
And by the way, I was gifted Choaniki this week.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.640
So much to gift me.

30:31.640 --> 30:32.640
Thank you.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.640
Heart.

30:33.640 --> 30:34.640
Gift me next.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.640
Gifts?

30:35.640 --> 30:38.920
I can't break my boycott when people give me gifts.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.040
I forgot to remind you to take the Wii Fit.

30:41.040 --> 30:45.120
Oh, that's alright, I'll get it next week, or something.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.120
More news!

30:46.120 --> 30:47.120
More news!

30:47.120 --> 30:48.120
Dun dun dun!

30:48.120 --> 30:51.840
Mega Man 9, for everyone who has been happy and excited and getting a little bit flickery

30:51.840 --> 30:57.640
giddy about it, it actually has a Japanese release date now.

30:57.640 --> 31:02.920
Mega Man 9 is supposed to be out in Japan on September 24th for a thousand Wii points.

31:02.920 --> 31:09.160
We don't have our date here yet, or in Europe, but Capcom loves us.

31:09.160 --> 31:13.240
At least they better, bitches.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.560
I'm sure it'll be here soon.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.800
No, but seriously, seriously, seriously.

31:16.800 --> 31:23.640
It was actually reported, I do believe, by Dengeki Online, the release date, so not too

31:23.640 --> 31:24.640
bad.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.160
So I'm looking forward to it.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.520
I would honestly think that we'd probably get it close to the same day.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.920
I was gonna say, is odds looking good we'll get it around the same day?

31:32.920 --> 31:34.360
I hope so.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.360
Be nice.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.360
Maybe.

31:36.360 --> 31:41.240
Well, if you can't wait that long, you'll be happy to know that Strong Bad, episode

31:41.240 --> 31:50.080
2, Strong Baddie of the Free, will be releasing this Monday on WiiWare and on the PC.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.080
Woohoo!

31:51.080 --> 31:55.320
And I have no idea what's gonna be happening in the game, because 1, I didn't play the

31:55.320 --> 32:00.640
first one, and 2, I don't really visit the websites.

32:00.640 --> 32:03.120
More of the wonderful humor that was in the first game.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.120
Of course.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.120
It's episode 2.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.120
It's awesome.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.560
It's like you watch a TV series, this is episode 2.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.880
Like you watch a show like South Park and episode 1 was funny, so you tune into episode

32:10.880 --> 32:11.880
2.

32:11.880 --> 32:12.880
That's the whole thing.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.080
And then things get angsty in episode 2.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.240
Yes.

32:16.240 --> 32:20.040
And you know, characters start sleeping with each other and form these complex relationships.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.880
No, I totally made that up.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.720
But that would be interesting.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.920
I think you've been watching too much daytime TV, right?

32:26.920 --> 32:28.920
No, just 90210.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.920
Alright.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.560
Just kidding.

32:32.560 --> 32:35.040
Moving on, something else is coming out on the Wii quite soon.

32:35.040 --> 32:40.840
Wii Music, and you know, we've had certainly mixed opinions on Wii Music, but sometimes

32:40.840 --> 32:45.680
I kind of think that Nintendo does these kinds of things just to kind of impress us.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.600
Like try to get a certain niche audience.

32:47.600 --> 32:54.880
That's right, you are hearing in the background cowbell in Wii Music.

32:54.880 --> 32:58.120
Wii Music is actually getting cowbell.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.720
And they're actually demoing it there.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.920
You can actually check out a little trailer there.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.500
It's hit game trailers, but it's also on Nintendo's site.

33:05.500 --> 33:11.260
So insert your needs more cowbell joke here, because it's probably what got this in the

33:11.260 --> 33:12.260
game.

33:12.260 --> 33:15.580
Somebody at Nintendo thought, heh, joke, funny.

33:15.580 --> 33:19.760
Or that the cowbell is actually considered a real instrument, which in some ways it really

33:19.760 --> 33:20.760
is.

33:20.760 --> 33:24.000
The cowbell isn't, I actually got through this music store at Hayton Ashbury, that has

33:24.000 --> 33:25.480
like cowbells with features.

33:25.480 --> 33:28.840
I'm like dude, it's like cowbell.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.840
Electronic cowbell.

33:29.840 --> 33:34.040
Oh, this one's got extra muting, and this one has tone change, and this one's got this.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.160
I'm like dude, it's cowbell.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.160
You bang it with a stick.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.760
I played the electric cowbell.

33:38.760 --> 33:42.320
I know, electric cowbell, that'd be awesome.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.320
Amplified cowbell.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.320
Amplified cowbell.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.160
Like a cowbell that sounds like a gong every time you hit it.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.360
A cowbell doesn't vibrate like that.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.560
Do you get to play gong in Wii music?

33:52.560 --> 33:53.760
That would be kind of awesome.

33:53.760 --> 33:57.200
No, but I will gong Wii music.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.680
Alright.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.720
Wii music is getting more cowbell.

34:01.720 --> 34:02.720
Haters!

34:02.720 --> 34:03.720
There you go.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.160
Well, this is something that I love.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.800
Very happy about this.

34:07.800 --> 34:15.240
There have been ratings put out for the Australian OFLC board for Castlevania III Dracula's Curse.

34:15.240 --> 34:19.120
That'll be for a virtual console, and they gave it a G rating.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.800
So that's fairly indicative that we're going to be getting it to be joining all the others

34:22.800 --> 34:24.120
that are already there.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.640
Isn't that nice?

34:25.640 --> 34:28.400
It's wonderful news, because Castlevania III is one of the best.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.400
Really.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.400
One thing I hope.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.400
Really.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.400
Hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.720
That it's like the Japanese version.

34:33.720 --> 34:36.920
I somehow knew you were going to go there and get into the whole discussion about the

34:36.920 --> 34:38.200
extra sound or whatever.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.200
No, that wasn't it.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.200
I thought that was what it was.

34:40.200 --> 34:44.160
When you played Grant, you know, the one who walks, who climbs on the ceiling and everything?

34:44.160 --> 34:45.160
Hell yeah!

34:45.160 --> 34:46.560
How can you forget Grant if you've ever played Castlevania III?

34:46.560 --> 34:50.880
Well, he throws his knife instead of just stabs, so he actually has a ranged attack.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.160
Oh, so he's actually useful.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.160
Yes.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.160
Oh, nice.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.800
Because I always used the one that had the fire ice.

34:55.800 --> 34:56.800
Cypher?

34:56.800 --> 34:57.800
Yeah.

34:57.800 --> 35:02.120
But what's the point in him throwing knives if he can have a sub-weapon of throwing knives?

35:02.120 --> 35:03.840
I don't think he can.

35:03.840 --> 35:08.080
Wasn't there something else, too, with Castlevania, and it's that the Famicom since it had like

35:08.080 --> 35:09.080
an extra sound?

35:09.080 --> 35:10.480
Didn't it have an extra sound processor or something?

35:10.480 --> 35:11.480
I think it did.

35:11.480 --> 35:19.440
I think if I'm correct, it ran off the disc, and the disc system did actually have, like

35:19.440 --> 35:23.360
have you ever heard the Legend of Zelda for the Famicom disc?

35:23.360 --> 35:25.200
Had actually really nice music in it.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.200
Oh, okay.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.800
So it was the difference in the sound processors, too.

35:27.800 --> 35:34.000
Little known fact, the Famicom disc system had a sound channel for porno soundtracks.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
What?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
True.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
False.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Absolutely true.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
What?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Really?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
I wouldn't lie.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Absolutely true.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Yes, you would.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.640
Game Guru in chat says, JP will get JP version, US will get US version.

35:45.640 --> 35:51.720
Sad but true, but well, or if it's easier to not emulate off the disc system, because

35:51.720 --> 35:56.840
I don't think there have been any disc games that have come to Virtual Console, maybe JP

35:56.840 --> 35:57.840
will get US version.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.560
No, it's going to be the US version.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.560
We got Excitebike, didn't we?

36:01.560 --> 36:03.280
Oh, that's true, we did.

36:03.280 --> 36:07.120
No, but Excitebike wasn't the disc version.

36:07.120 --> 36:08.480
What did they do with the save load?

36:08.480 --> 36:11.360
Even here in America, though, remember, we got the cartridge and it still had save load,

36:11.360 --> 36:14.600
and it would just crash your game if you tried to use it, which I thought was one of the

36:14.600 --> 36:18.640
most hilarious things ever on the old school Nintendo, that they just left it in there

36:18.640 --> 36:19.640
when we didn't have the attachment.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.640
Awesome.

36:20.640 --> 36:24.160
Well, if I was right, the entire game was done in English anyway.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.160
Hmm.

36:25.160 --> 36:31.280
If only Nintendo knew they were setting trends with Excitebike that soon will be followed

36:31.280 --> 36:35.520
by large companies like EA releasing games that are broken.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.520
Awesome.

36:36.520 --> 36:41.840
I think Gyromite also had it, if I'm right, but no, it didn't, because Gyromite was the

36:41.840 --> 36:47.160
one that my husband and I went through like 15 copies of when he had his used game store,

36:47.160 --> 36:50.680
and took out the converter cartridge so that we could make our own converter.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.680
Oh, nice.

36:51.680 --> 36:52.680
Nice.

36:52.680 --> 36:53.680
Yeah.

36:53.680 --> 36:58.760
There were actually that many copies of Gyromite in circulation, that many Rob the Robot sold.

36:58.760 --> 36:59.760
My friend had one.

36:59.760 --> 37:00.760
We have one.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.760
I knew one friend that had one.

37:01.760 --> 37:02.760
We have one.

37:02.760 --> 37:03.760
What did they really do?

37:03.760 --> 37:04.760
Like nothing.

37:04.760 --> 37:05.760
They had the little spinny thing.

37:05.760 --> 37:06.760
It was a selling point, that's it.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.760
It didn't do anything.

37:07.760 --> 37:11.720
You can play three games with this thing, and he's going to look cool, and then that's

37:11.720 --> 37:12.720
it.

37:12.720 --> 37:13.720
He looks like Johnny Five.

37:13.720 --> 37:17.080
I mean, a lot of people don't really understand what Rob the Robot actually did.

37:17.080 --> 37:21.060
Like basically, didn't he just, like he had these little spinning disks that you would

37:21.060 --> 37:25.720
put down, like these little top things that you would put down on these giant things that

37:25.720 --> 37:27.600
just pressed your controller?

37:27.600 --> 37:28.600
Pretty much.

37:28.600 --> 37:29.600
It was-

37:29.600 --> 37:30.600
It was-

37:30.600 --> 37:31.600
Rob, it was a selling point.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.560
It was amazingly stupid in retrospect, and I realized that Rob the Robot is like pop

37:35.560 --> 37:39.840
culture cool, and everybody like laughed when they saw him in Brawl, but if you think about

37:39.840 --> 37:46.160
it, Rob the Robot was really stupid, like in all actuality.

37:46.160 --> 37:49.600
But anyhow, sorry, let's move on to some release dates.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.880
Rob, like I said, it was a selling point.

37:51.880 --> 37:54.720
Yeah, because people look at the box, and you think-

37:54.720 --> 37:56.920
Nintendo does what Genesis don't.

37:56.920 --> 38:01.280
You think that Rob the Robot is going to vacuum your house, but that's not what it does.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.280
It does nothing.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.640
Yeah, you're going to have to dust off Rob the Robot once in a while.

38:05.640 --> 38:06.840
All right, look, enough bitterness.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.200
Let's get to some release dates around the world, Loki.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.660
Rob the Robot just exudes awesome.

38:11.660 --> 38:14.120
That's what Rob the Robot does.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.120
He exudes fail.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.120
That's what Rob the Robot does.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.120
Exudes awesome.

38:17.120 --> 38:22.120
Okay, so today, we had Rock Band 2 come out on the 360.

38:22.120 --> 38:27.320
For everybody else that's on other platforms, you wait till October.

38:27.320 --> 38:36.280
Anyways, on PC this week, we've got Stalker Clear Sky, Cabela's Big Game Hunter 09 Legendary

38:36.280 --> 38:43.080
Adventures, and that's also coming out on the PlayStation 2 Wii, and I believe that's

38:43.080 --> 38:44.720
it.

38:44.720 --> 38:48.960
Let's see here, Star Wars The Force Unleashed will be coming out on pretty much every system

38:48.960 --> 38:51.440
out there.

38:51.440 --> 38:57.760
Not any retro systems, all current systems, until someone makes a joke.

38:57.760 --> 39:02.480
Drawn to Life, Spongebob Squarepants Edition.

39:02.480 --> 39:03.480
This is funny.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.800
They have on this list, Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed.

39:05.800 --> 39:08.400
Oh, that game's been canceled.

39:08.400 --> 39:13.200
TNA Impact coming out on the Wii this week, delayed from last week.

39:13.200 --> 39:18.680
Crisis Warhead on PC, I like how they had that PC built for it, even though this game

39:18.680 --> 39:24.720
is more, I don't know, it's meant for lower end PCs.

39:24.720 --> 39:28.240
The Witcher Enhanced Edition on PC.

39:28.240 --> 39:32.560
We have Hell's Kitchen coming out on PC this week.

39:32.560 --> 39:36.980
Armored Core for Answer on PS3 and Xbox 360.

39:36.980 --> 39:40.960
We have Igor coming out on PC, DS, and the Wii.

Line Rider 2 Unbound on PC and DS.

39:45.200 --> 39:49.800
Dance Dance Revolution X on PlayStation 2.

39:49.800 --> 39:53.520
Enchanted Unicorn on PC.

39:53.520 --> 39:59.600
Kid Supports Crazy Golf on the Wii, that game's gonna suck, it's Data Design Interactive.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.680
Bratz Ponies 2 on DS.

40:02.680 --> 40:07.160
Dragon Quest IV, Chapters of the Chosen on DS.

40:07.160 --> 40:10.160
Battle of Fantasia on 360.

40:10.160 --> 40:16.960
My Secret World by Imagine, the same people did that Imagine Baby stuff, and it's a diary.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.800
Yay, a diary!

40:18.800 --> 40:28.080
Up here on PS3, 360, and PC, we got Super Pickups on the Wii, Unsolved Crimes on the

40:28.080 --> 40:34.880
DS, Zoo Hospital on the Wii, apparently it's like Trauma Center meets, like, a pet hospital,

40:34.880 --> 40:36.320
it's kinda neat.

40:36.320 --> 40:40.960
Red Bull BC-1, that game I've been kinda talking about for a while now, check it out, it's

40:40.960 --> 40:42.960
on the DS.

40:42.960 --> 40:48.880
And let's see, there's some collections, retro collections coming out from Namco, they have

40:48.880 --> 40:59.480
the Naruto Ultimate Collection, which is Naruto the Ultimate Ninja 2 and 3, and Uzumaki Chronicles.

40:59.480 --> 41:06.440
And then the Namco Classic Fighter Collection, which is Soul Calibur II Tekken 5, and, god,

41:06.440 --> 41:08.040
I can't remember the last one.

41:08.040 --> 41:11.440
And then Pac-Man Power Pack, which is a bunch of Pac-Man games.

41:11.440 --> 41:13.440
Nothing good, unfortunately.

41:13.440 --> 41:17.440
And I think that's all the big stuff, at least.

41:17.440 --> 41:23.680
Alright, yeah, any price point, I know a lot of our listeners are probably into DDRX, any

41:23.680 --> 41:25.120
price point for that?

41:25.120 --> 41:29.560
I wanna say it's $40 for the game only, and for the bundle it's probably $49.99.

41:29.560 --> 41:34.440
I would've thought maybe it came down a little bit in price, because PS2 is kinda, you know,

41:34.440 --> 41:35.440
the last...

41:35.440 --> 41:39.200
It may have, I'm just going off memory, and that's, you know, not exactly accurate.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.920
Alright, so don't take that as the final word.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.040
Here, give me one second, I can tell you.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.840
Well, let me do the Japanese release dates, then you can kinda jump in whenever you find

41:45.840 --> 41:46.840
it.

41:46.840 --> 41:50.320
Going over to the Japanese release dates, Star Wars The Force Unleashed is coming into

41:50.320 --> 41:55.480
the Asian regions around Japan, and on all those other consoles as well.

41:55.480 --> 41:59.640
As far as Japan, Japan itself is getting Unreal Tournament 3 on the Xbox 360 this week, on

41:59.640 --> 42:03.560
the 18th, for those folks that like the first-person shooters over there.

42:03.560 --> 42:08.080
I know the scene's not quite as big over there, but they've got some fans of it.

42:08.080 --> 42:11.880
Some PlayStation 3 games getting a price reduction this week, including Def Jam Icon and Fight

42:11.880 --> 42:12.880
Knight Round 3.

42:12.880 --> 42:19.560
Again, those are price reductions on the PlayStation 3, down to about $30 US.

42:19.560 --> 42:24.920
Some other games coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 3, GI Jockey 4 2008, and Winning

42:24.920 --> 42:30.040
Post 7 in a combo pack, or, of course, you can just get the game GI Jockey 4 by itself.

42:30.040 --> 42:35.640
Also, Trusty Bell, Shoupan no Yume, you might know this here as Eternal Sonata, finally

42:35.640 --> 42:38.360
comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.760
It's $29.99 for the game only.

42:40.760 --> 42:41.760
Much better.

42:41.760 --> 42:42.760
Good.

42:42.760 --> 42:46.280
Unreal Tournament 3 also comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week, so be on the lookout

42:46.280 --> 42:47.820
for that.

42:47.820 --> 42:53.760
Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo Wii, we have Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles getting

42:53.760 --> 42:54.760
a price reduction.

42:54.760 --> 42:57.560
You know that, of course, as Resident Evil.

42:57.560 --> 43:00.200
GI Jockey Wii 2008 as well.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.000
Kororimpa gets a price reduction.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.280
Bomberman comes out next week, so be on the lookout for that.

43:05.280 --> 43:09.120
That's actually on next week's list, on the 25th.

43:09.120 --> 43:14.760
Moving on to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 2 still getting a lot of love.

43:14.760 --> 43:19.920
Hyper Street Fighter 2, the Anniversary Edition and Vampire Darkstalkers Collection value

43:19.920 --> 43:20.920
pack.

43:20.920 --> 43:27.400
So, for you old-school 2D Capcom fighting fans, a little PS2 pack coming out for you

43:27.400 --> 43:28.400
guys.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.400
That's happiness.

43:29.400 --> 43:36.640
GI Jockey 4 2008 also gets a version on PlayStation 2 and gets a combo pack with Winning Post

43:36.640 --> 43:38.200
7, also on PlayStation 2.

43:38.200 --> 43:43.960
And a game called Heart no Kuni no Alice is coming out as well on the PlayStation 2.

43:43.960 --> 43:49.720
Let's take a look at the handheld systems, starting off on the Nintendo DS.

43:49.720 --> 43:54.200
Dragon Ball DS comes out this week from Namco Bandai.

43:54.200 --> 43:57.240
Lumi's Sleight, Hikari no Puzzle as well.

43:57.240 --> 44:00.960
Long Vacation, Iruka Toel Watashi comes out.

44:00.960 --> 44:09.880
And Oshishi Keiji, Keiji-san Watashi Ga Arimashita comes out from success.

44:09.880 --> 44:13.480
And we'll see if it will be a success over in Japan, although probably not.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.480
I've never heard of it.

44:14.480 --> 44:20.920
On the Sony PlayStation Portable, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G Hunter Leather Cover.

44:20.920 --> 44:21.960
So that's not a game.

44:21.960 --> 44:26.480
It's just something to match all the Monster Hunter games that you have for your PlayStation

44:26.480 --> 44:27.480
Portable.

44:27.480 --> 44:32.280
But if you actually want a new game, you can get Samurai Dou Portable is the name of that

44:32.280 --> 44:33.280
game.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.800
And I'm not sure if that's a fighting game or what type of game that is.

44:36.800 --> 44:39.360
It looks to be an action-based game.

44:39.360 --> 44:40.520
I don't think it's a fighting game, though.

44:40.520 --> 44:43.720
I think it's a hack-and-slash type PSP game.

44:43.720 --> 44:48.600
It's rated 15-plus or 0C, so you know there's going to be some good blood.

44:48.600 --> 44:49.600
Hooray!

44:49.600 --> 44:50.600
Blood!

44:50.600 --> 44:51.600
Gore!

44:51.600 --> 44:52.600
That's it for your Japanese release dates.

44:52.600 --> 44:59.160
For the UK, we have the 18th Warhammer Online, for the 19th is everything else.

44:59.160 --> 45:06.280
Destroy All Humans Path of Furon, Hell's Kitchen the video game, Play TV for PlayStation 3,

45:06.280 --> 45:15.360
Open City Creator, Star Wars The Force Unleashed, also STCC The Game, The Witcher Enhanced Edition,

45:15.360 --> 45:17.600
and Tim Stockdale's Writing Star.

45:17.600 --> 45:23.040
Oh, and also Yakuza 2.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.040
That's it?

45:24.040 --> 45:25.040
That's it.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.560
You know, The Force Unleashed, we all mentioned that in our respective releases.

45:27.560 --> 45:30.600
It's practically a worldwide release this week.

45:30.600 --> 45:33.720
But one thing that's kind of interesting about it, one thing I was reading about on the internet,

45:33.720 --> 45:37.680
I was trying to see if GameStop was doing a Rock Band 2 midnight release, because I

45:37.680 --> 45:40.040
really just didn't want to go to Walmart, but it was pretty much the only thing that

45:40.040 --> 45:43.880
was open, and yes, I had to have the game at 1201, even though I didn't get it until

45:43.880 --> 45:44.880
1230.

45:44.880 --> 45:48.800
But anyway, apparently the reason why GameStop did not do a midnight release for Rock Band

45:48.800 --> 45:53.160
2 is because a lot of them are doing midnight releases for Force Unleashed, and they just

45:53.160 --> 45:54.600
didn't want to pay all that extra salary.

45:54.600 --> 45:58.680
A lot of people, I mean, I would see why they're doing that, because The Force Unleashed is

45:58.680 --> 46:02.840
coming out on a lot more systems, and a lot of people might not be interested in the game-only

46:02.840 --> 46:04.640
version of Rock Band.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.120
And there's a lot of rabid Star Wars fans.

46:07.120 --> 46:08.120
I mean, really.

46:08.120 --> 46:12.280
So, I mean, I can understand why they would do that, but oh well.

46:12.280 --> 46:16.840
VXJsonXV played Hell's Kitchen the game in our chat room, and he laughs hahaha and said,

46:16.840 --> 46:19.560
I played Fox's Flash version of that.

46:19.560 --> 46:20.560
It was silly.

46:20.560 --> 46:24.240
Yeah, and you know what's funny is that Flash version of it is pretty much what you're getting

46:24.240 --> 46:25.880
on the Wii and the DS.

46:25.880 --> 46:26.880
Nice.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.320
It's crap, so.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.680
Frisbee says, bake that fucking bread now!

46:30.680 --> 46:34.320
Sadly, I don't think the Wii version of the game will swear at you, which is the only

46:34.320 --> 46:36.160
reason to watch Hell's Kitchen.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.160
I don't get it.

46:37.160 --> 46:41.600
Like, if you're not going to get berated by your Nintendo Wii, what's the point?

46:41.600 --> 46:45.240
Now you're just playing, like, Cake Mania with some fire.

46:45.240 --> 46:51.520
It's basically just, like, Cooking Mama mixed with American Idol, you know, where they berate

46:51.520 --> 46:53.320
you based on your performance.

46:53.320 --> 46:54.320
Sounds kind of fail-tastic.

46:54.320 --> 46:56.320
It is fail-tastic.

46:56.320 --> 47:03.740
So, anyways, at least some people have, I don't know, a good sense of humor about people

47:03.740 --> 47:06.120
breaking street dates.

47:06.120 --> 47:12.560
Rock Band 2, people that managed to get their copies early were welcomed with custom screens

47:12.560 --> 47:18.600
taunting them from, I guess, Harmonic Central, including, welcome to Rock Band 2, nice work

47:18.600 --> 47:20.800
on scoring this game before it comes out.

47:20.800 --> 47:25.520
I remember there was another one on the day after that or so that was saying, you know,

47:25.520 --> 47:30.120
try our impossible set list or something, see if you're worthy of owning the game early

47:30.120 --> 47:31.120
and stuff like that.

47:31.120 --> 47:34.200
So it was kind of funny.

47:34.200 --> 47:38.920
And then, of course, for those people that finally picked up their copy, you'll be greeted

47:38.920 --> 47:47.400
with some new tracks to download this Tuesday, including the Megadeth album Peace Sells,

47:47.400 --> 47:56.600
Who's Buying, and they've got, it looks like, about seven songs available there for two

47:56.600 --> 48:01.280
bucks each or you can buy the whole pack for eleven bucks, so you save a few bucks there.

48:01.280 --> 48:05.560
Remember back in the day when like eight marathon songs was an album?

48:05.560 --> 48:08.680
Like, you know, you'd get eight songs from a rock band, but they would be just like effing

48:08.680 --> 48:12.520
epic rock songs, like seven, eight minutes in length?

48:12.520 --> 48:13.520
Megadeth.

48:13.520 --> 48:14.520
Awesome.

48:14.520 --> 48:15.520
Megadeth was awesome.

48:15.520 --> 48:22.280
And then also, if that's not your cup of tea, they have the Rock Band Tour Pack, which includes

48:22.280 --> 48:27.260
One of Those Nights by The Cab, Hands Down by Dashboard Confessional, She's a Handsome

48:27.260 --> 48:31.860
Woman by Panic at the Disco, and Natural Disaster by Plain White Teas.

48:31.860 --> 48:36.800
All those are available for a buck or 80 Microsoft points, or you can buy the whole pack for

48:36.800 --> 48:37.800
four dollars.

48:37.800 --> 48:40.200
So you're saving zero money.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.200
Nice.

48:41.200 --> 48:47.320
By the way, speaking of rock band download stuff, I know our one and only Dark Sakura,

48:47.320 --> 48:52.240
one thing she loves almost more than video games is Gorillaz, and therefore Blur, because

48:52.240 --> 48:54.120
you know, the whole Damon Auburn connection.

48:54.120 --> 48:55.320
I know!

48:55.320 --> 48:58.720
I did check out Beetlebum, which is available in the Rock Band Store.

48:58.720 --> 49:00.800
It is a cover, if you weren't already aware.

49:00.800 --> 49:01.800
It's not horrible.

49:01.800 --> 49:02.800
It's not worth having.

49:02.800 --> 49:03.840
It's not horrible.

49:03.840 --> 49:06.820
At least you have the song, because, you know, ideally you're supposed to get someone else

49:06.820 --> 49:10.720
to sing to it anyway, but it is a cover, if you didn't know and already know.

49:10.720 --> 49:16.160
Well, if you do sing it, you have to do the really, you know, extra thick accent that

49:16.160 --> 49:17.800
he affects for the song.

49:17.800 --> 49:18.800
Exactly.

49:18.800 --> 49:23.640
You know, and I realize this is like the quintessential Blur song, but we have to have song two come

49:23.640 --> 49:24.640
out at some point.

49:24.640 --> 49:25.640
I mean, come on.

49:25.640 --> 49:30.200
Either that, or There's No Other Way.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.200
Or Boys and Girls.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.200
I like that song.

49:32.200 --> 49:34.200
Well, you know, my favorite is.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.200
I like Coffee and TV too.

49:35.200 --> 49:36.200
That's a good song.

49:36.200 --> 49:37.200
Anyhow.

49:37.200 --> 49:41.960
But, but they probably aren't going to have anything off of the later two Blur albums

49:41.960 --> 49:44.200
because they're very kind of at least in this country.

49:44.200 --> 49:45.200
Does anybody know this?

49:45.200 --> 49:46.640
Did this weren't as big here?

49:46.640 --> 49:48.520
Oasis was a weird album.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.520
Yeah.

49:49.520 --> 49:50.520
All right.

49:50.520 --> 49:51.520
Anyhow.

49:51.520 --> 49:52.520
Sorry.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.520
Enough Blur dish.

49:53.520 --> 49:56.520
By the way, I love the fact that the rock band people were so kind of, you know, funny

49:56.520 --> 50:00.680
about the early release dates because true story, I have a friend of mine who is, uh,

50:00.680 --> 50:05.520
who got the game early and was paranoid to go on Xbox live with the game, having it like

50:05.520 --> 50:10.020
the Tuesday before, because he thought that they were going to like, you know, track him

50:10.020 --> 50:11.920
and report him or something like that.

50:11.920 --> 50:15.840
So I found this whole thing really funny because I sent a link to one of the blogs that had

50:15.840 --> 50:18.800
a picture of the thing and I put, what are you so afraid of now?

50:18.800 --> 50:21.180
You big chicken.

50:21.180 --> 50:25.160
So I thought it was funny that, you know, everybody's afraid to go online, like they're

50:25.160 --> 50:27.280
going to get busted and banned or something.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.280
Yeah.

50:28.280 --> 50:31.640
And harmonics really didn't seem to give us some of the, uh, we were playing that last

50:31.640 --> 50:37.240
night and some of the, um, uh, like vocal sections in the game were kind of easy to

50:37.240 --> 50:38.240
hit.

50:38.240 --> 50:39.240
I remember, was it Jim?

50:39.240 --> 50:40.240
Um, sabotage.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.240
Right.

50:41.240 --> 50:46.880
He would know what you want, what you want, he was just like kind of blah, blah, blah.

50:46.880 --> 50:47.880
He's like drunk.

50:47.880 --> 50:53.520
So, you know, he was just, that's what he was literally kind of yelling and he was like,

50:53.520 --> 50:54.520
awesome.

50:54.520 --> 50:55.520
I don't know.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.000
I thought it was funny.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.160
And then Irene, if you've listened to this show long enough, you know, rice princess

51:00.160 --> 51:05.560
was making up new lyrics and saying something about my butt to all these songs, which was

51:05.560 --> 51:07.440
very rude in my opinion.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.440
Very rude.

51:08.440 --> 51:13.400
Anyhow, thank God that there was no video camera there so it can be on YouTube.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.400
All right.

51:14.400 --> 51:18.420
Uh, let's talk about Guitar Hero for a minute cause you know, Guitar Hero is coming out

51:18.420 --> 51:21.560
pretty soon and they're going to be having a, you know, their whole little kit.

51:21.560 --> 51:25.320
They've got the, uh, drums and the guitar and I'm looking forward to this cause I need

51:25.320 --> 51:29.040
a new guitar and I kind of really want the new Guitar Hero guitar.

51:29.040 --> 51:32.900
Um, well, not only do you already know about the bundle, but now you know exactly what

51:32.900 --> 51:34.960
songs you're going to be getting in the game.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.760
I'm not going to read the entire song list.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.280
You can probably just Google Guitar Hero World Tour song list.

51:39.280 --> 51:42.600
You'll find the whole thing, but I do want to point out some highlights of the song list,

51:42.600 --> 51:43.600
at least in my mind.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.600
I'm sure everybody feels differently.

51:44.600 --> 51:50.480
Uh, 311, Beautiful Disaster, Beastie Boys, No Sleep Till Brooklyn, Billy Idol, Rebel

51:50.480 --> 51:56.280
Yell, Blink 182, Damn It, Blondie, One Way or Another, Bon Jovi, Living on a Prayer,

51:56.280 --> 52:01.840
even though that's in rock band, Coldplay, Shiver, The Doors, Love Me Two Times, The

52:01.840 --> 52:07.280
Eagles, Hotel California, Filter, Hey Man, Nice Shot, I like that song a lot, Fleetwood

52:07.280 --> 52:11.200
Matt, Go Your Own Way, although again that's in rock band, Foo Fighters, Everlong, also

52:11.200 --> 52:16.960
in rock band, Guess Who, American Woman, also I believe that is in rock band.

52:16.960 --> 52:18.480
So there's quite a bit of overlap.

52:18.480 --> 52:22.320
Um, Jimi Hendrix, Purple Haze, and The Wind Cries Mary, that's pretty cool they have Jimi

52:22.320 --> 52:23.320
Hendrix.

52:23.320 --> 52:28.360
Uh, the other kind of Jimi, Jimi Eat World with The Middle, Korn with Freak on a Leash,

52:28.360 --> 52:32.440
Lenny Kravitz, Are You Gonna Go My Way, that is like the quintessential guitar song in

52:32.440 --> 52:33.440
my opinion.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.800
That's a fucking rad guitar song, I can't wait to play that.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.960
Uh, Linkin Park, but who cares.

52:37.960 --> 52:41.920
Leonard Skynyrd, Sweet Home Alabama, live.

52:41.920 --> 52:42.920
Really sweet.

52:42.920 --> 52:45.040
Yes, and I know you're an Alabama girl so you'll like that.

52:45.040 --> 52:50.080
Metallica, Trapped Under Ice, Michael Jackson, Beat It, that's kind of awesome.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.640
I wasn't expecting that one.

52:51.640 --> 52:57.440
Uh, Muse with Assassin, Nirvana with the Unplugged version of About a Girl, that's pretty rad.

52:57.440 --> 53:03.400
No Doubt with Spiderwebs, No FX, Sold Out, Ozzy Osbourne with Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley,

53:03.400 --> 53:09.120
uh, Pat Benatar, Heartbreaker, R.E.M., the one I love, Smashing Pumpkins Today, although

53:09.120 --> 53:10.120
that's in rock band.

53:10.120 --> 53:13.520
Uh, I knew I said I wasn't going to read this whole thing but I kind of am.

53:13.520 --> 53:17.320
Survivor, Eye of the Tiger, which is also in rock band but you know everybody loves

53:17.320 --> 53:18.320
that song.

53:18.320 --> 53:21.560
Sublime with Santeria, I don't really care for that song myself.

53:21.560 --> 53:22.880
But a lot of people do.

53:22.880 --> 53:26.560
Tool, three songs by Tool in the game.

53:26.560 --> 53:27.560
I like Tool.

53:27.560 --> 53:33.960
Uh, Para, Parabola, Schism and uh, Vicarious, Schism, I don't listen to Tool, I don't like

53:33.960 --> 53:34.960
them actually.

53:34.960 --> 53:35.960
But that's just...

53:35.960 --> 53:36.960
Well, whatever.

53:36.960 --> 53:42.800
Um, Van Halen, Hot for Teacher, that was a song that got played over and over again at

53:42.800 --> 53:45.040
Penny Arcade Expo.

53:45.040 --> 53:48.160
And Wings with Band on the Run.

53:48.160 --> 53:51.120
Cause you know we needed some wings in Guitar Hero.

53:51.120 --> 53:55.600
So there you go, Guitar Hero World Tour and uh, definitely, definitely a lot of very guitar

53:55.600 --> 53:56.600
centric songs.

53:56.600 --> 53:59.000
You know, especially with Jimi Hendrix, The Doors.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
That's pretty awesome.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.400
I'm surprised that they don't do like any, I wish they would have more songs like Beat

54:04.400 --> 54:05.400
It and stuff like that.

54:05.400 --> 54:06.400
Yeah, I know.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.400
Like pop crossovers and stuff.

54:07.400 --> 54:09.320
We need a pop band or a pop hero or something.

54:09.320 --> 54:11.800
Not even necessarily have to do that but some download packs.

54:11.800 --> 54:15.280
Like I don't understand why there isn't more Michael Jackson stuff in there cause Beat

54:15.280 --> 54:18.020
It works and you might even be able to do like Thriller and stuff.

54:18.020 --> 54:21.360
Just like stuff that had a lot of guitar and stuff in the background.

54:21.360 --> 54:24.080
Dude, Thriller needs to be downloaded content.

54:24.080 --> 54:25.600
Make it happen.

54:25.600 --> 54:26.600
Lovely folks.

54:26.600 --> 54:27.920
And like also like country stuff.

54:27.920 --> 54:31.520
I mean there's that one song, Rockstar, that would work pretty well.

54:31.520 --> 54:34.680
Um, I'm just surprised there's not a lot of that stuff.

54:34.680 --> 54:39.380
It may not be enough for its own game but you know at least throw some download content

54:39.380 --> 54:40.380
out there.

54:40.380 --> 54:44.820
I'm sure people would appreciate, you know, appealing to a broad, or broader audience

54:44.820 --> 54:45.820
I guess.

54:45.820 --> 54:51.480
Alright, well there you have it, the Guitar Hero World Tour set list and a lot of guitar

54:51.480 --> 54:53.640
fans very excited about this game.

54:53.640 --> 55:01.120
Well, in other exciting news, and this is uh, actually I think it's pretty cool, um,

55:01.120 --> 55:04.000
Rob, do you ever watch Comedy Central?

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Of course!

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
I love Comedy Central.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
That's where I get South Park.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
What's your favorite show besides South Park?

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
South Park.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
My favorite show besides South Park?

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
The Daily Show.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Okay, well I forgive you.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.560
That actually is a good show but, um, for a...

55:15.560 --> 55:16.880
My third favorite show?

55:16.880 --> 55:17.880
Yes.

55:17.880 --> 55:18.880
The Colbert Report.

55:18.880 --> 55:19.880
Good for you!

55:19.880 --> 55:20.880
Alright.

55:20.880 --> 55:21.880
Here you go.

55:21.880 --> 55:26.680
Because, um, Stephen Colbert is going to have a song in Rock Band.

55:26.680 --> 55:27.680
Awesome.

55:27.680 --> 55:34.160
Yes, um, Charlene is going to be available as a free download for Rock Band so everyone

55:34.160 --> 55:35.640
has to go get it right now.

55:35.640 --> 55:37.720
Yes, it is actually available now.

55:37.720 --> 55:38.720
Yes.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.560
But it's one of those blink and you miss it things.

55:40.560 --> 55:41.560
Get it!

55:41.560 --> 55:44.420
Yeah, because if you go into Rock Band you won't see it in the new releases.

55:44.420 --> 55:46.040
It's only in the library.

55:46.040 --> 55:50.840
And if anyone wants to familiarize themselves with it, while they already should be, except

55:50.840 --> 55:54.200
that I'm not really all that familiar with it, um, you can actually watch the video on

55:54.200 --> 55:55.880
YouTube as well.

55:55.880 --> 55:59.480
So go watch it after the show.

55:59.480 --> 56:02.840
The song's only like a minute long and it's not that difficult either.

56:02.840 --> 56:06.160
I've heard people are getting their achievements with it.

56:06.160 --> 56:08.200
All the more random.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.240
The lyrics are very funny.

56:10.240 --> 56:13.600
It enables the players to achieve more.

56:13.600 --> 56:16.080
Actually, we can play a little clip from Charlene.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.080
It's only like a minute long.

56:17.080 --> 56:18.080
Please do.

56:18.080 --> 56:19.080
I'm near you, I think of you.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.080
I think of you when I dream of you and I'm taking pictures of you.

56:20.080 --> 56:30.080
I think of you when I'm in a blimp looking down from up above you.

56:30.080 --> 56:36.680
You know I'm missing you.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.240
I love the synthesizer in this song.

56:38.240 --> 56:39.240
My mind is kissing you.

56:39.240 --> 56:45.360
I'm right behind you now, Charlene, waiting one last time.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.360
Oh, nice.

56:46.360 --> 56:47.360
Reminds me of my ex.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.360
All right.

56:48.360 --> 56:50.360
Oh my god, that's so wrong.

56:50.360 --> 56:51.760
There you have it.

56:51.760 --> 56:52.760
So wrong.

56:52.760 --> 56:53.760
Oh my god.

56:53.760 --> 56:56.920
There'll be a couple people listening to the show that understand that.

56:56.920 --> 56:58.560
All right, let's move on quickly.

56:58.560 --> 57:03.120
Anyway, speaking of appealing to a broader audience, SingStar is releasing a country

57:03.120 --> 57:12.320
version which will be coming to the PlayStation 2 on October 28th, and you can find, I guess,

57:12.320 --> 57:23.560
songs from Kelly Pickler, Keith Urban, Montgomery, Gentry, and among others.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.800
And yeah, it's kind of interesting.

57:25.800 --> 57:30.760
Also they're going to be localizing SingStar Legends as well, which is supposed to be coming

57:30.760 --> 57:35.520
out the same day, and that has a bunch of pop legend stuff.

57:35.520 --> 57:42.720
You can probably guess that all your favorite stuff, maybe some Cher thrown in there.

57:42.720 --> 57:43.720
Oh, hooray.

57:43.720 --> 57:45.880
Yeah, because you can't have enough Cher.

57:45.880 --> 57:46.880
Never.

57:46.880 --> 57:47.880
Never.

57:47.880 --> 57:48.880
Never.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.160
So that's pretty much what's going on in SingStar World?

57:50.160 --> 57:53.400
Yes, lots of releases for SingStar on PlayStation 2.

57:53.400 --> 57:56.380
However, you can import all that stuff into your PS3.

57:56.380 --> 57:57.920
How dare you?

57:57.920 --> 57:59.680
How dare you, Loki?

57:59.680 --> 58:07.040
How dare you talk about SingStar and not talk about the most important announcement of all

58:07.040 --> 58:08.260
time?

58:08.260 --> 58:14.360
This is the greatest moment in video game history happened this week around SingStar,

58:14.360 --> 58:16.000
and Loki just somehow missed it.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.980
It's a decider who wins the console war, right?

58:17.980 --> 58:26.760
The console war has been won this week by Sony PlayStation 3, and it's all because of

58:26.760 --> 58:32.120
ABBA.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.120
That's right.

58:33.120 --> 58:39.160
SingStar ABBA was announced this week by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe for release

58:39.160 --> 58:46.440
on the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 3 later this year, and so you can sing hits

58:46.440 --> 58:47.440
like Waterloo.

58:47.440 --> 58:59.760
Let's take a listen.

58:59.760 --> 59:04.760
This was one of those moments, and then God spoke, and he said, let there be ABBA, and

59:04.760 --> 59:07.680
there was, and Sony won the war.

59:07.680 --> 59:10.280
There it is.

59:10.280 --> 59:14.600
I mean, let's just end the fucking show, because there's no other news that's going to top

59:14.600 --> 59:15.600
this.

59:15.600 --> 59:16.600
Does that mean we can go home now?

59:16.600 --> 59:19.240
I don't know why, but it's just going to be pathetic.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.480
Well, I don't know.

59:21.480 --> 59:24.320
I still think that my story was the best story ever.

59:24.320 --> 59:25.920
Well, Stephen Colbert is pretty cool.

59:25.920 --> 59:26.920
We'll try, Rob.

59:26.920 --> 59:27.920
Try to find something fun.

59:27.920 --> 59:28.920
I will find something fun.

59:28.920 --> 59:30.080
Let's talk about DJ Hero.

59:30.080 --> 59:33.460
There's a lot of people that are very excited about DJ Hero, because they think it's going

59:33.460 --> 59:34.460
to be BeatMania 2DX.

59:34.460 --> 59:39.960
It's going to be like, you know, the answer to BeatMania 2DX by the folks who did Guitar

59:39.960 --> 59:40.960
Hero.

59:40.960 --> 59:47.800
Well, you'd be kind of like half right, because it's not really going to be like BeatMania

59:47.800 --> 59:48.800
2DX.

59:48.800 --> 59:52.520
If you were thinking of a controller with a turntable and five buttons, not really.

59:52.520 --> 59:55.060
It actually sounds like it's going to be a lot different.

59:55.060 --> 01:00:02.160
Some information has leaked from inside sources of a new pioneer little hookup for this thing.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.880
I guess this is just a mockup, but this is to get you to think of what it would look

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.880
like.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.360
So if you imagine one of these things, you could hit this little turntable, and there's

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.080
actually going to be little effector buttons on it.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.160
It's like a version of one of those type of decks.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.880
You use these little effector buttons and a crossfader to actually drop samples.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.560
So if you ever thought, like, hey, BeatMania isn't really like DJing, now you have a game

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.160
that is actually kind of DJing, you know what I mean?

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.160
Which is kind of cool.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.400
Well, I think it's different.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400
It's different, right?

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400
No, it's not.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400
Why?

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400
Why are you so negative?

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.880
Okay, well, the description that they had for this is basically, the screen's going

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.440
to be set up where you're going to see kind of like a bottom half of a record, and the

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.160
notes or whatever will be coming along, I guess, like three different tracks, and basically

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.760
you have to hold those effector buttons down while you scratch.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.760
Hmm.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760
Let's see here.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:59.680
If we take the scratch and replace it with strum, and we turn the effector buttons into

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.500
fret buttons, we have Guitar Hero.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.440
So really, it's just re-skinning Guitar Hero to put different music in it.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.440
Well, but in a way, but think about this.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.440
This does sound kind of cool.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.320
Let's say the wireless controller apparently is actually grooved to fit in your lap, so

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.000
you can actually sit this thing in your lap and play with it in your lap, which is kind

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
of cool.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And then get this.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.720
Apparently, now this is the part where I have to spend a little disbelief.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.920
I think this is wishful thinking, but if it's true, it's pretty awesome.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.280
Apparently, the game song list is all mashups.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.600
Like it's all band versus band.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600
Like what was that?

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.680
Like the Grey Album, right?

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.680
Metallica versus Beatles.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.140
Remember that was like a really famous mashup that supposedly...

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.200
The Grey Album was Jay-Z and the Beatles.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.200
Oh, never mind.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.200
Sorry.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.200
Jay-Z.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.200
Because I'm thinking of Metallica's Black Album.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.200
I know it was like a Black Album mixed with a White Album.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.400
But think of those types of things.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.200
It's supposed to be mashups is going to be the whole song list.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.200
You like mashups, don't you, Loki?

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.000
I thought you loved that kind of stuff.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I don't know.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.400
I think this game is going to be...

01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:01.680
People will probably buy it because it's something that Activision is putting out, but I think

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.680
it's going to be...

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:06.280
If you're thinking it's going to be 2DX, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.920
Well, we'll see what happens.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.520
No, it's not going to be 2DX, but it sounds like it could be cool.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.760
I don't necessarily need a copy of a game that's already out there and still selling

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.760
in Japan.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.760
You know what I mean?

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.360
I like the fact that it's kind of different.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.240
And they're also saying that they're supposed to do guitar co-op as well.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.240
I don't know.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.960
We'll have to see how it actually plays out, but I'm not too optimistic yet.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.140
What's interesting and possibly related is that almost within the same breath, Activision

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.720
announced this week that they have acquired Freestyle Games.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.840
It's a UK-based developer, and they made the game B-Boy, which was on the PSP.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.800
I don't think it really sold like crazy, but it was a rhythm action game that was available

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.040
on the PSP.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.320
And apparently what they're doing is they're developing a new music-based IP.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.320
Hmm...

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.320
B-Boy?

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.320
DJ Hero?

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.320
Connection?

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.040
Who knows?

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.020
But it certainly is interesting that Freestyle Games was sucked into the Activision collective

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.020
this week.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.020
So there you go.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.160
People will eat this up.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.680
As long as you do something innovative with it, you know, if you can mix actual MP3s or

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.400
something like that, that might be kind of cool.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:19.960
But somehow I'm gonna set the bar a lot lower than, you know, I would like it to be.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.080
By the way, B-Boy was not just available on the PlayStation Portable, it is available

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.800
on PlayStation 2 also in the United States.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.320
Yeah, it got released here a couple weeks ago.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.920
But it was probably one of those, again, kind of blink-and-you-miss-it sort of things.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.920
It was an alright game.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.920
Was it?

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.920
I mean, it was okay.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.920
I had never even heard of it.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.920
You guys say blink-and-miss-it because I missed it.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.040
I played the PSP, the UK version of the PSP game a while back, and it was alright.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.560
It wasn't a lot to hold my attention for a long time, but it was pretty cool.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560
Alright.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.560
Fair enough.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.560
Alright.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.560
Well, there you have it.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560
We'll see.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.000
More information on DJ Hero may be made by these guys.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
We'll see.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.480
Well, Sony is not happy.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.480
Not happy at all.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.480
Why?

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.480
They should be elated.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.480
They have ABBA.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.440
Yeah, but the PSP people aren't happy.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.440
They want it all.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.560
And, I mean, as if ABBA wasn't big enough, they want everything.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.420
They want third-party support for the PSP.

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.760
They're not very happy with it.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:18.560
Basically, the boss of Sony Worldwide Studios, Yoshida Shuhei, is basically saying that they'd

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:25.120
like to see more third-party support on the PSP and that they're jealous because other

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.400
people are getting third-party support and not them.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.520
He's quoted as saying it's really, really disappointing.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.240
I mean, it's so disappointing he had to use really twice.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240
What?

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.640
It didn't get the point across.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.160
And it's a lost opportunity for the third parties.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.480
They should look at what the PSP can do for their titles and the potential for the business

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.940
that their IP has.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:54.640
They say, though, that Sony's got a whole bunch more things ready, but they are really

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.560
wanting Capcom, maybe?

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:01.680
But you know, the PSP 3000 is on its way.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.680
You know, I have the feeling that they're forgetting that there's a reason why there's

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.320
developers not making games for the PSP because they've made games on the PSP in the past

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.600
and they haven't sold well at all.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.240
I mean, that's kind of what it is.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.840
A lot of people are avoiding the PSP and not that it's a bad system.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:18.840
It's just...

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.500
The DS is more fun.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.500
Not even that.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.680
I wouldn't even go that far.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:28.000
It's just, there's a lot more people that own the DS because they're suckered into buying

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.360
multiple colors for it, or God knows what.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360
I don't know.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.520
I like the PSP a lot better than the DS, but I...

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.520
But if you go back to that rule that a system is only as good as the games that are on it...

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520
Exactly.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.840
There's better games on DS in general, so people are going to go where the good games

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840
are.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.660
And in a way, this is what Sony's complaining about, is that the third parties aren't giving

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.440
them what they need to sustain.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.400
Well, maybe start supporting the third parties a little bit more.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:55.880
Maybe do some innovative features to the PSP, like, you know, make voice chat a lot easier.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.960
Now that they have the microphone built in, they can do some stuff with that.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.960
Touchscreen.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.000
That might be kind of cool.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.880
Tilt sensors.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.840
I always kind of thought that the PSP's strength over the DS was that it was more of a kind

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.140
of all-in-one type system.

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:13.080
It was like part iPod, part game player, part web browser.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.320
It's just a little bit of everything for relatively low price.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.320
It depends on what you want, and if you...

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:20.680
Like, for me, I have absolutely no reason to really play a PSP much except for a couple

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.100
of games, really.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.880
If I was in high school, though, all over again, I would be all over this PSP.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.600
I mean, this would be a great thing to take to high school, I think, because you got it

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.600
all right there.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.040
Well, when I was in high school, it was the Atari Lynx.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.920
Wow, if that.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.000
I didn't have one of those.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.120
I had a Game Boy Brick.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.920
Actually, it was the Turbo Express.

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.640
I had a Game Boy Brick and a brick...

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.640
And a Game Boy Brick.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.320
A gray case that I hauled it around in, it got stolen.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.200
I had a Game Boy Brick and a friend of mine had a Turbo Express.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.680
I was like, cool, I want one.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.680
But anyway.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.680
Hmm.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.720
Well, there's some other good things, though, coming to the PSP, and I know we don't talk

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:04.760
about it too much, but they actually have a lot of games now on their PC store that

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.800
you can download the full versions of.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:12.520
It's almost like a digital version of it, kind of like what they do with the PS1 Classics,

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.600
included this new lineup of stuff.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:20.720
You're going to have Cube, Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords for $14.99, which is not bad.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.880
Work Time Fun for $10.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:30.040
You get PQ, PQ2, that one game that's kind of like IQ, the first one for $9.99, the second

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:35.860
one for $14.99, and Deadhead Fred, which is kind of a sleeper game for $15.

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:41.520
So they are releasing quite a bit of stuff on the PC store.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.200
I kind of think it's funny, though, that they have digital copies of it now, because, I

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.760
mean, people have been doing that before in not such a legit way.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.480
But now they're encouraging it.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.680
And by the way, if you're listening to this show on a PSP, which a lot of our emailers

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.040
and so on have told us that they do, you need to, like, pause the podcast right now, and

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:05.240
you need to go to OLRPSP.com in your browser and check out the new Orange Lounge Radio

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:09.680
All Games Tuner that's available on the downloads page there, because it's quite awesome.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:13.680
And we'll allow you to listen to the All Games Radio live feed right there from your crossbar

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.920
without having to, like, hunt around for it.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.440
It's like one-click access to the show, which is great.

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.800
It's great for you, because you find quality gaming radio fast.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.920
It's great for us, because we get more listeners easily.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.440
So install it on your friends' PSPs, too.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.000
Get their permission first, though.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
That's the nice thing to do.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
But, you know.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
You know, it's funny.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.400
Someone jokes about SingStar for PSP.

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.680
I wouldn't doubt that they may have something like that in the future.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.680
Hmm.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.680
Interesting.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.680
We'll see.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:41.680
All right.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.680
Let's see.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.720
Moving on to another Sony-related story, and this is the type of game a lot of folks can

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720
get into.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.720
It's Kingdom Hearts.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.080
And a lot of people have kind of been wondering, when's the next Kingdom Hearts game gonna

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.080
come out?

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.400
Where's our information on Kingdom Hearts 3?

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.760
Well, sadly, we don't have that.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.600
But what we did get from this week's GameStop Expo, which is kind of a meeting of all the

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.960
important people at GameStop, happened this week.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.120
Apparently, a little piece slipped out about Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.960
You might remember that this was a Game Boy Advance game that got released on the PlayStation

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.960
2 in Japan as part of a Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix type thing that came out.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.440
It was like a bonus disc.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.560
And it kind of was forgotten about and never was released over here.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.660
Until now, apparently, Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, it is going to be coming to the

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.200
US.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.260
There was a small mention of Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories at Square Enix's presentation.

01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:35.240
When they were asked if it was the same one that was Final Mix 2 in Japan, they did confirm

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.240
it with a nod.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.240
There hasn't been an official announcement through Square, just this small mention.

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.360
So I guess you should take it with a little bit of a grain of salt.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.480
But apparently, if you tie things together, back in July, Squeenix was hiring an English

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.640
voice cast.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.200
So probably to go for this game.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:56.640
Although that could also be for Final Fantasy 13, but who knows?

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.840
I would think, why not release this game here?

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.240
I mean, certainly, there's an audience for it.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:07.080
But, you know, they usually don't pay attention to everybody, do they?

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.080
Who knows?

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.080
It is Squeenix.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.080
They have gotten a lot more friendly about the whole worldwide releases and all that

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.080
fun stuff.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.320
Well, let's hope.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320
Let's indeed hope.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.520
Well, let's hope that Dark Sakura has dug through the archives this week and picked

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.100
an awesome Classic Game of the Week this week.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.560
Have you done so, Dark Sakura?

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.920
I'd like to think that I have.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.080
All right, well, let's get to it.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:32.680
Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week, the way we end Part A every week here on our lovely

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.560
program here at Orange Launch Radio.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.920
What should the kids be playing this week?

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.160
The Classic Game of the Week came out on Super Nintendo.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.160
It is one of the Mario franchises, and it is Mario Paint.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.680
Awesome.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:54.640
Mario Paint uses the SNES mouse that came with it, and it basically is a little drawing

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.320
program for the most part.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:02.240
I mean, it basically is like Microsoft Paint, but the...

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:10.880
I don't really want to go too much into the more, you know, structured part of the game.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.960
Let's go into what's playing in the background.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.240
This is a little clip from F-Zero that somebody has put into the little music maker in Mario

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.240
Paint.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:30.560
Well, right, it did actually have a music program in there, and you could actually save

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.920
things onto...

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.280
I do believe that you could actually tape them, but it was very weird.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.880
A lot of these are more, you know, these days are done through an emulator now.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:47.240
But there was, going back to the art side of it, you could actually make stamps, and

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:52.200
it came with stamps in it too, and that was cool, but you had 30 different colors, 60

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:59.960
different textures and patterns, 75 different stamps, 15 customizable stamps, battery backup,

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:05.000
and special erasers like the fade erase, water erase, where the picture becomes a grayscale

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
and vanishes.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.360
Timed erase, rain erase, split image erase, pixelated erase, blinds erase, rocket erase,

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.360
and abrupt erase.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:27.240
I'm just imagining, but here in the background, we have Dragon Force.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.720
I think this cheated a little bit though, this is using one of those external Mario

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.040
Paint emulator things, but yeah, same idea.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.160
I know, I included basically a lot of those just because I thought they were fun.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:44.760
But yeah, there were the mini games called, a fly swatting game called Coffee Break or

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:52.200
Nat Attack, and you played as the glove hand, which as we all know was the boss in the Smash

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.600
Brothers games, right?

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.860
And it holds a fly swatter, and it has to swat things.

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.920
I love Nat Attack.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:09.040
There was also a little mini game on the title screen, where you could click the letters

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.400
to have a certain sequence of actions go on, and then you could change the music, I'd have

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.640
Yoshi show up, and paint the background.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:24.200
And also, this is a game that has a particular, yeah I put Power Rangers on it too because

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.800
it's funny.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:31.840
But have you ever heard of Totoka's song, Rob?

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840
No.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:39.080
Kazumi Totoka was the guy who did a lot of Nintendo music, and there's a song that is

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.060
like basically his little nineteen note song that shows up in all the games he does stuff

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:48.400
on his little easter egg, and it shows up, oh I have heard of that.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.400
I have heard of that, yes.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.320
But for anyone who doesn't know, on Animal Crossing, it actually was KK's song, in Animal

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.320
Crossing.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:01.880
So, I just wanted, you know, it was actually the, when you click the letter O in Mario

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.880
Paint, the song plays.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.960
And for anyone who doesn't know, it was actually, the first appearance of it was in a Game Boy

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.960
game called X.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:15.600
It was only out in Japan, unless you happened to either import or use ROMs.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:27.320
So Mario Paint is, another, has another pop culture, oh yeah.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:33.440
This is the song, Air Man, Taos and I, I think, yeah.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.320
I don't want to point out, this one is done in a legitimate Mario Paint.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.320
Yeah, that one was.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.920
And I thought it was very well done.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:47.560
But anyway, the first episode of Homestar Runner was animated in Mario Paint.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.360
That's so awesome.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.040
There have been sequels.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:57.760
There was one on the Nintendo 64 double D called Mario Artist, which was a launch title,

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:03.560
and it brought out the mouse for the Nintendo 64, and it was to make 3D polygonal models,

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:11.280
and you could actually insert images onto these 3D models using the Nintendo 64 capture

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.160
cartridge and then show everyone, show your work with the communication kit online.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:21.040
Although we didn't, of course, get that over here, but Mario Paint did have a sort of appearance

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.720
in WarioWare Touched as Wario Paint.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.720
Nice.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.960
And you had the turntable and the toy room and all that.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:35.260
And the most fun game was in WarioWare Mega Microgames, and Wii Photo Channel has an editing

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.840
system that's similar to Mario Paint.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:43.320
And then, like we were mentioning before, there have been stand-alone applications of

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.320
the music program.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.320
And I had to put that one on there.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:54.240
You've been paint-rolled, lol.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.320
So the game is Wario Paint.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.880
It is your classic game of the week.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:04.720
Mario Paint, available on the Super Nintendo, with yet another one of Nintendo's famous

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.720
peripherals, the mouse.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:07.720
And the mouse...

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:08.720
It was only on one game.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.720
No, no, it was one other.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.720
I want to say there was one other game that you could use it with.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.880
I think you could also use it on the gun games.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.880
I don't remember.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.400
I want to say, couldn't you use it on Lemmings you could use it on?

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.400
Lemmings.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.400
Lemmings you could.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.400
Lemmings was one.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.400
In fact, I think I remember that actually being sort of a feature of it, wasn't it?

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.400
I think so.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.520
I kind of irritated me, though.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.520
Anyway, that's it.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.520
There you go.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.520
Classic game of the week.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:35.080
All right, that's going to do it for part A of our show tonight, but stay tuned.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.080
There's plenty more to come.

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.440
We're only halfway there.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.640
In part B tonight, your phone calls and more news, including some updates on Mortal Kombat

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.760
versus DC Universe, Batman Arkham Asylum, and some news about Capcom, and some more

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.960
Xbox bundles coming soon.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.320
So we're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back in just a little bit with more

01:16:53.320 --> 01:17:01.800
of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.120
So you've got a bunch of websites and podcasts about anime, manga, or video games, but you

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:09.360
just don't have the time to read and listen to them all.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.740
When are you actually going to find the time to play games or watch anime?

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.400
That's why there's Antigamers.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.720
Not only are we a comprehensive anime, manga, and video game blog with news and reviews,

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.960

The Antigamers podcast, because we all need another anime and gaming podcast, right?

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.000
Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.040
Recently I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on Xbox Live.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.160
You always can't suck my fucking dick.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.640
I just got a dick in your ass.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.560
Do you like that dick in your butt, Ken?

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.560
Where's Barbie?

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.560
Yeah, where's Barbie?

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.560
Is that Urkel?

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560
Urkel's your Barbie, huh?

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560
Is she in Malibu or no?

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.920
Please, stop spewing hate speech on Xbox Live.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.680
It doesn't make you look cool, it won't get you any friends, and at the end of the day,

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.960
you still have an incredibly small penis.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:53.920
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.440
That's a little old school bumper bringing us back there.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.760
That is like a million different people yelling out acronyms, I still don't know what they

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.760
mean to this day.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.800
That was Megumi doing GGPO.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.800
What does that even mean?

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.800
Good game, peace out.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.800
Oh, okay.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:07.800
Oh, nice.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.800
All right.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.800
There you go.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.000
All right, so yeah, those are our friends in Step Squad.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.200
Is there still a Step Squad that plays DDR?

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:20.560
I'm sure Step Squad is still around, although honestly, the last time I saw Jahi, every

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:26.400
time I ever see him is like randomly in Japantown, like when I'm not even trying, and I ran into

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:32.080
Wendell at Fonome last year, and I've seen him a few times recently, and once at Yowie

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.080
Con.

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.080
Nice.

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.080
Very nice.

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.520
I think he was working security or something.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.840
All right.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.840
Very cool.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:45.120
VXJ6V is in chat and says, I asked that four years ago when I was on the show, and I guess

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.840
I forgot what GGPO means.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:47.840
My bad.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.840
Nice.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:49.840
What, Logie?

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:53.080
Before we started the second half here, I wanted to mention something I mentioned to

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:57.160
you yesterday.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:08.000
We all got 14 day trials to World of Warcraft from PAX, and my wife wants to try Warcraft.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.840
Oh my god.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.680
The rapture is coming.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.680
Start praying.

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.680
Wow.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.680
Is she really going to do it?

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.680
I think she is.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:17.680
Actually, go ahead.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.520
I was going to say, she hates games, but she's going to start playing WoW.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:24.800
Well, she's going to try the 14 day trial.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.800
Wow.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:26.800
Amazing.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.280
We also, I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun a little bit for emails.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.280
Sure.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.280
Sure.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.280
We got one from Sakura Max.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.280
This is from my cell phone.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.280
I survived the hurricane.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.280
No electricity.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.280
Minimal damage to my house.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.280
Thank you.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.280
Ah, yes.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.280
Thank you for reminding.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:45.120
There was that horrible hurricane that happened, and we hope any listener who is potentially

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.540
impacted by that is doing okay.

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:52.440
From what I hear, it's a lot of really, really bad damage, but I don't know.

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.920
I hope I don't make an ass out of myself, but last time I checked, it didn't sound like

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.920
the fatalities were nearly as bad as the last time we had a major hurricane in this country,

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.520
so I guess that's progress.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:05.900
It's still very unfortunate, but I hope all of our listeners are a-okay.

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:10.080
It sounds like most people got out of there in time, so hopefully people packed their

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.840
stuff up and got out of there, and remember, stuff is stuff.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.360
Stuff is just stuff.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.360
Yep.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.520
So, best of luck to all those folks.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.240
And it's still moving through other parts of the country, through the Midwest, and so

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:24.240
on, so we hope everybody's doing okay.

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.040
But now it's just a tropical depression or whatever.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.440
And to respond to Chat Room, I'm not necessarily encouraging her to play.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:36.800
That's something she wants to try, because everyone keeps talking about it.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.040
She feels left out.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:43.040
Personally, I don't know if I would start playing, because I don't know if I'd want

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.040
to.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.240
Sharon in Chat has a very strong opinion, if Loki wants to help Nellie with World of

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:53.080
Warcraft, he should just get her a real RPG instead, oo-burn.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.480
She doesn't have the patience for that stuff.

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.280
For the record, I actually, um, I'm not going back in the Chat Room because I keep getting

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.280
dropped.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.280
Doh.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.960
Yeah, we're having some network problems here in studio.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.960
It's annoying!

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.760
Just another night here at OLR, so I guess maybe somebody will be buying me a new router

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.760
soon.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.760
I don't know.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.080
Moving on, we're going to get into some gaming news tonight, here at Orange Launch Radio,

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.320
some more.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.480
We haven't even talked at all, really, about Xbox 360 news, and I think that's where we're

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.160
going to start tonight, right, Loki?

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.160
Yep.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.800
There was, of course, some rumors coming out of PAX about a possible new Halo game coming

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.500
out, and then people realized, oh, it's just the map pack, and there was new achievements

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.320
that got leaked out, and all that fun stuff.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.140
Well, those new achievements have been confirmed as actual achievements that will be coming

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:48.840
to Halo 3, and they're coming to Halo 3 later this month, so you can expect for, I guess,

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:53.280
I don't know how many new points they're going to add to it, but a whole bunch of new achievements.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:58.160
I guess they come out with a new map pack, so that'd be kind of neat.

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.640
And it's part of their title update, too.

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.860
Well, hooray for them doing a big update.

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.860
It's going to be free?

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:04.860
Yes.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.860
We hope.

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.860
Awesome.

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:07.860
The update will be free.

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.520
It's going to be free, but map pack, probably not.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.400
But remember, and not to discourage people buying it, but remember all those other map

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.400
packs that they had out there?

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.920
Well, those eventually become free anyway, so...

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:19.920
Dope.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.920
Yeah, it's a rental.

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:22.920
Alright.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:28.840
Well, hey, if Halo 3 is not your cup of tea, maybe you're more of a fighting game fan,

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.960
and you're looking forward to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, which we talked about last

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.100
week here on the show post PAX, because they had a playable on the show floor at PAX, and

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:40.080
it was big, dumb fun, is what it was, I would call it.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:45.840
Well, unfortunately, some of the big, dumb fun has been ruined this week, thanks to a

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.480
leaked list of achievements.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:52.560
Xbox360achievements.org, hey, you know what, they were just doing their job, that's what

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.040
they do, they uncover achievements as soon as they find out about them.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:00.000
Well, it turns out the achievement list spoils the entire character roster from Mortal Kombat

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000
vs. DC Universe.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Yay!

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.440
So now we know who's in the game.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.400
And you know, Midway kind of danced around this, obviously, you know someone was pissed,

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:11.580
you know somebody's heads was rolling after this, they initially said, we have not officially

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:16.520
released it, and then they came back and said, yeah, okay, it's true, dongle between our

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.560
legs, run away, yipe yipe yipe.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:25.400
Alright, so here's the characters from Mortal Kombat, Baraka, Jax, Kano, Katana, Liu Kang,

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:30.840
Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, Sonya, and Sub-Zero.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.760
So a pretty good list, that's pretty much the Mortal Kombat 2 roster without Mileena

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.760
and...

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.480
Well, they said, they also said that that might not be everybody.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.900
True, they could always do download characters and so on, right?

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:45.920
Or there's characters that just don't have achievements.

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.920
Right, right.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.880
And there's one other character missing too, god, why can't I remember his name, the guy

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.120
with the hat that cut people down the middle.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.120
Oh, Kung Lao.

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.520
Kung Lao, he's not in there either.

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.920
DC Universe.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:24:59.920
And no reptile either.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.320
Alright, DC Universe, this is the stuff people really, really care about, I'm sure, the comic

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.320
book characters.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.320
Here's who's coming from DC Universe.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.320
Batman, what's that?

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.800
Nothing, I'm just, it's a pet peeve, that's okay, keep going.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.800
Oh, okay.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:13.800
DC Universe has...

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.800
I'll say it when you say his name.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:20.360
Batman, Catwoman, Dark Seed, Deathstroke, I think it's Dark Side.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:27.720
Dark Side, Flash, sorry, you know what a comic book fan I am, Flash, Green Lantern, The Joker,

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.600
Lex Luthor, Shazam, Superman, and Wonder Woman.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.160
You know, it's funny, every time I hear Shazam, I think Kazaam, and I'm like...

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.640
It's Captain Marvel.

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.640
Okay.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.920
Wait, why did they...

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.640
Because that's what all of his books were called.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.960
Oh, okay.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:46.960
I see.

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.360
Well, but that's what they're going to refer to him as in the game, probably, I guess,

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.820
because if they're pulling this off the achievement list, they must be referring to him as that

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:57.400
in the game, so, interesting.

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.400
There you go.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.320
Well, I'm excited, now we can finally throw down Wonder Woman vs. Catwoman, that'll be

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.320
awesome.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.960
Looking forward to that.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:11.440
Oh, this game comes out soon, be on the lookout for it, it'll be out before the holidays.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.440
And there you go.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.440
I don't know.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.680
November 19th, if I remember correctly.

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:15.680
Is that it?

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.680
All right.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:17.680
Just in time for Thanksgiving.

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.360
I just wish they'd have other unlockable characters later on, that would be neat.

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.160
They may, and they may have pay-to-unlock characters, who knows.

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.880
You know, this is the first Mortal Kombat on the next-gen system, am I right?

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.880
Yeah.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.800
Yeah, so who knows, they might have the downloadable characters, that'd be kind of cool.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:39.040
Well speaking of stuff related to the DC Universe, this personally makes me giddy.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.200
I mean, crazy loony giddy.

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:48.000
For the game Batman Arkham Asylum, they are getting Mark Hamill to play Joker.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.280
And that makes me happy, because as far as anyone who has ever voiced the Joker, Mark

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.520
Hamill is the one.

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.520
I'm sorry.

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.520
When I think Joker, I think, you know, when I'm not thinking of the comic books, I'm thinking

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.080
of animated series Joker, just because he's so goofball, I think is cool.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.480
You don't think about the movies, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, or any of that?

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.000
I have not seen Dark Knight, remember?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Oh wow, all right.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.440
I'm going to see it in IMAX.

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.000
It was pretty impressive, I gotta say.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.320
I'm going to see it in IMAX.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.320
It's here, inside.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.320
I know.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.320
You gotta go see it.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.320
When I go see it, it will be in IMAX.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.320
All right.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.320
Have fun.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.360
But this makes me very, very, very, very giddy.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:27.480
JackDeffDegrees in chatroom, chat.orangelandtrader.com, says, Mark Hamill is the Joker.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.040
And Solid Goomba simply says, fuck yeah, Mark Hamill.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.920
What is it about Mark Hamill that makes him so fucking amazing?

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.560
He does the best Joker, I'm sorry.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:41.320
Then he was, what was it in Jay and Silent Bob Cockknocker?

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.280
Yes, he was also in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.560
But there's more news.

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.480
You could appear in the game.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.480
Really?

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480
Me?

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480
There could be Rob in the game.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.480
Little old me?

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.480
Little old me?

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:58.760
There is a contest right now from GI that will allow the winner to become an Arkham

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.000
inmate.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.280
And you get your cell decked out with personal photos and wall scribbles.

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.160
That's more of a Loki role, don't you think?

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.760
I would be all over that.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:12.840
And all of my graffiti would be, hello, hi, mom, I'm in jail.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.840
I like it here.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:14.840
It's nice.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:19.560
I think, and I don't know if Travis still does this on Understandation Live, but maybe

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.000
my voice could be something like, I've been here for seven years.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.440
The medication doesn't work.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.340
Does he still do that on Understandation Live?

01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.340
I don't even know.

01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:29.340
That sounds weird.

01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:36.360
Somebody, no, there was this old sound bite he used to play like all the freaking time

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:39.880
of this guy going, I've been here for seven years.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:40.980
Forget it.

01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:41.980
We should all audition.

01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:43.900
Don't you want to be in a game as a crazy person?

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:44.900
Come on, Loki.

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:45.900
Admit it.

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:49.000
As long as I'm in a game as a crazy person.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.480
There you go.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.640
DJ Dark Knight says, I can't see Jamie being in jail.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.400
Oh, how little you know, Jamie.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.040
I've been in jail before.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.040
Really?

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040
Hi, dad.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040
I'm in jail.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.040
Are we talking about like Sadie Hawkins dance jail?

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.040
No.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.040
Really?

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.040
You went to the big house?

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.040
No, I went to the little house.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.040
I ran away from home once.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:09.040
Oh, okay.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.040
Oh, awesome.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.040
I never knew that.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.040
Yep.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.040
I ran away from home once.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.040
Okay.

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.040
Hi, dad.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.200
Did you have to make that phone call?

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.200
No, I'm in jail.

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.200
I like it here.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.200
No.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:23.200
There's like, just go sleep or read the Bible.

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.200
Alabama.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.200
They make you either sleep or read the Bible.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.600
Huh.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.080
And then my mom came and got me.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.080
So yeah.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.080
Wow.

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.080
I never knew that.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.080
Interesting.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.080
Huh.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.680
Six years and I never knew that Jamie was in jail.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.960
There's quite a bit about me you don't know.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:40.960
Apparently.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.800
But now the internet knows.

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.320
It wasn't real jail.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.320
Yeah, I know.

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.320
It wasn't real jail.

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.320
Okay.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:48.320
All right.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.320
Yes, Loki.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:56.800
So, of course, with the announcement of the price drop last week, the Xbox sales numbers

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:01.760
are apparently doubling according to Microsoft and I guess we'll have to see when the MPT

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.680
numbers come out at the beginning of October.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.640
But that's pretty promising.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:12.840
I mean, not a big surprise that, I don't know, it's selling well when it's cheaper.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:16.120
I mean, that's, I guess, a shocker to a lot of people.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.800
No, wait, no it's not.

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800
Is it Christmas yet?

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.800
Huh.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.240
Well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens with this.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.240
That's why I'm curious.

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.960
Is this a trend that's going to continue through Christmas?

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.960
I don't know.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:26.960
All right.

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.840
Xbox 360 is now going to sell because everybody got a Wii last Christmas.

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:30.840
I don't know.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.840
Who knows?

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:38.360
I still hear and it really irks me, not that I'm picking sides or anything, but...

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.360
But you are.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.360
I'm not.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.720
Yeah, really I'm not.

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:45.580
But when Sony comes out and like says, oh yeah, we're winning.

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:48.720
How are you winning when you have a quarter of the like market?

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:49.720
ABBA.

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:50.720
What?

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.720
ABBA.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.720
No, no.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.880
Listen, ABBA ain't going to do shit, okay?

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:56.880
Tell that to Rob.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:57.880
Bite your tongue.

01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:58.880
Tell that to Rob.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.880
ABBA ain't going to do shit.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.880
That's what I'm saying.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:01.880
No one buys SingStar.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:02.880
Okay?

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.880
Nobody.

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:04.880
Unless you're in Europe.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.880
I hate you.

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.880
I don't know you anymore.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:07.880
I disown you as a friend.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:08.880
And you know what?

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:09.880
I thought Mamma Mia sucked.

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:10.880
No.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:11.880
Get out of my house!

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:21.800
It just irks me when they say that they're winning, but it's like, dude, listen, you're

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.160
not even close to winning.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:29.960
I mean, if you were like, you know, the Wii back in June when you were like 10,000 units

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:33.860
away from, you know, becoming number one, yeah, that's close to winning.

01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:37.880
When you're millions of units behind, that's not close to winning, okay?

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.420
So don't talk that you're, you're going to do it.

01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:41.760
You're going to do it by like year's end.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.760
Or you're not.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.440
You're not going to do it by year's end 2011, okay?

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.760
So stop it.

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.760
Seriously.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.280
So are you saying that SingStar Abba's not going to sell well?

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:57.560
Would you care to make a little wager on SingStar Abba selling well or not?

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.080
No, I'm not.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.200
What doesn't have to be Tingle?

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:02.960
I can think of far better punishments.

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.960
No, it's not.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:05.960
Damn.

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:09.000
Everybody make chicken noises at Loki.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.240
I'll think about it, but I'm pretty sure it's not.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.520
Oh, he said, I think about it.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.520
I got to do my research.

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.520
All right.

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.520
Rob, I will totally play SingStar with you.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.520
I know.

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.960
You're getting the Abba one, right?

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:26.560
The chat room is, the chat room is demanding it on Justin TV when it comes out.

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.400
So we'll see.

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.280
We'll see.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:34.000
Moving on.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.720
We'll see how the Xbox 360 sells after the price drop and moving on into Christmas.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.280
I think they're going to continue to sell pretty well.

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.760
The question is, will they overtake Nintendo or will Sony answer them?

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760
That's another one.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.720
A lot of people seem doubtful, but who knows?

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.120
Another game that a lot of folks have been playing on their Xbox 360s as well as their

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:56.000
PlayStation 3 is Burnout Paradise.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.760
And a long awaited motorcycle download is coming on September 18th.

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.760
It's actually a new patch, basically.

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:07.880
It's a free download update, 38 new clock race events.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:15.520
Dynamic weather events, a day-night cycle, meaning the game goes up from day to night,

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:20.600
70 new challenges in the Freeburns thing, and motorcycles.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.600
So that's pretty cool.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:22.760
But when are they adding the airplanes?

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:25.200
That's what I want to know, because they're talking about adding airplanes.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.200
I'm glad to be...

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.200
Who's got giant enemy crabs?

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.200
Yes.

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:33.040
I want to be able to drive a giant enemy crab.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.380
This is one of those games that I played for three days and I never played again.

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:39.360
And I keep thinking I need to go back and play it again.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.520
This is giving me the incentive to do so, so I'm definitely going to have to check it

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:43.520
out.

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.520
Sounds pretty cool.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.720
Have you been playing any Burnout Paradise, Loki, or has this kind of put it away?

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:51.320
No, I just noticed the other day that I still have my copy of Burnout Paradise sitting on

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.820
a shelf.

01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.920
It just came out at a bad time, from what I remember.

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:57.960
I need to go back and look at it again.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:02.280
It was better than the last one, but I don't know.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.600
It's just, when the next big game came out, I forgot about it.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:12.440
And sadly enough, you know, with Rock Band 2 and stuff, when Saints Row 2 comes out,

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:15.160
I'm going to forget about Rock Band 2.

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.160
Never.

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.400
I'll never forget about Rock Band 2.

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.960
Hey, they're doing a pretty good job trying to extend the life of it with the challenges

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:20.960
and everything.

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.000
But anyway, let's move on.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Moving on.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Yes, please.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.760
Well, you know one of my favorite ever companies is Capcom, right?

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:31.760
Yep.

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760
Yeah.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.760
They were nice to me.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.280
I don't know why they were mean to you.

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.680
Do we have to go back there again?

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.680
Because don't get me started, do not go there.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:45.800
Well, Capcom is planning on doing all of their major titles on multiple platforms to maximize

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:51.400
their impact in the United States, especially, just outside of Japan.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:56.880
And it's actually quoted as saying basically where the consuls are practically waging war

01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:01.000
on one another in their annual report.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.400
It said, completing implementation of multi-platform development on major titles means that all

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:11.040
major titles launched during the next fiscal year or thereafter will be developed as multi-platform

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.040
games.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:19.400
So, that's why we should be, you know, that's why Devil May Cry 4, for example.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.400
Or Mega Man 9.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:22.400
Mega Man 9, exactly.

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:26.600
A lot of us assumed it was going to be WiiWare only and then suddenly it's showing up everywhere.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:35.520
The MT framework is actually supposed to be for PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 development.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.280
Resident Evil 5, Street Fighter IV are among the list.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:46.200
And so they're also thinking about including a few more casual games like for Wii and other

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.880
more casual game systems.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:52.040
You know it would be interesting if they released Mega Man 9 on PC as well.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.440
Why not, huh?

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:57.840
You know there was an old, old, old Mega Man game on the PC that I owned, and it wasn't

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.440
related to any of the other Mega Mans.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:02.800
I remember it only had three boss monsters, which I thought was kind of cheesy.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:05.040
Are you talking about Man of the Power Battles?

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:11.240
No, it was an actual, it was a side scroller like in the vein of the Nintendo games, but

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.480
with better graphics at the time because it was on PC.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.960
I don't know, maybe somebody in the chat room knows more about this and can remember.

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:20.380
I actually bought this game like way back when in the early 90s, and it had like three

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:22.160
boss monsters, so it was short.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.400
But I remember like one of them was electricity based, as you remember.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:29.600
It wasn't, it wasn't based on, they were new Mega Man monsters.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.440
It was like a completely different Mega Man game.

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:33.440
I'm not crazy.

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:41.760
Well, in other news, they also are, they stated also again in their annual report Capcom did

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:47.360
that there are more Western focused titles in development, one of them named Dark Void,

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.760
if you know, we remember that.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:56.320
And they plan to aggressively acquire partners and other studios, especially independent

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:00.580
developers, the ones that will share their vision.

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:10.520
So I think that that's sounding to me very, like a potential good thing.

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.720
I found the information on Wikipedia.

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:13.720
Did you now?

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:14.720
Yes.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:15.720
It was by High Tech Expressions.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.520
It was released in 1990.

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.440
It was just licensed by Capcom.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:23.980
There were three robot masters, Volt Man, Sonic Man, and Dynaman, and there were only

01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.920
two levels in the Wily Fortress, so it was a short game.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.360
Yeah, I'd say.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.240
And there were other versions on PC, I guess, too.

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.240
I never knew about those.

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.240
I just had the first one.

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:37.040
I don't think the PC versions were very good.

01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.720
They were cool when I was a kid, but I don't think they're cool now.

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:40.720
What?

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.720
Thanks to you.

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:42.720
Huh?

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:46.480
The Air Man Can't Be Defeated song.

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.920
Whose fault is that?

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.920
Yours.

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:49.920
No.

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:57.400
Well, some things that are good come in threes, I guess, including a bundle that's being released

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.560
by Microsoft coming out later this holiday.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:09.260
It's a brand new 12 month live gold kit, and it's gonna come with Project Gotham Racing

01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:18.320
4, a 12 plus one month card of live, and the Xbox 360 messenger kit, and it's gonna run

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.480
you $69.99.

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:25.840
This was rumored to be coming out from the GameStop expo, although it's on their website

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.920
now, and I personally know it's coming out, so it is coming out.

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.980
It's kind of a good deal.

01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:36.320
There was some other bundle that they were talking about coming out as well that I haven't

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.640
heard anything on, but I know this one for sure is coming out, so.

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:40.640
Alright.

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.120
It's pretty cool.

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.960
Very cool, and especially when they're trying to move more consoles and units.

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.160
If I remember correctly, I think this is coming out in a few weeks, too, so.

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:49.160
Nice.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.160
Yeah.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:53.960
Well, there is some drama going on in the Microsoft world, and it has to do with a firing

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.360
that happened this week.

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:59.120
Apparently what happened, there was this guy who actually went on the record.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:04.800
He went on this website, VentureBeat, and actually talked openly about the red rings

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.800
of death.

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:07.160
The guy's name was Robert Delaware.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:11.480
He was a Microsoft game tester, but he was through a temp agency called Excel Data.

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:14.520
He was let go by the company on Wednesday.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.440
They are now threatening to sue.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.880
They're threatening civil charges to this guy, because apparently what he did, he went

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:25.000
on to VentureBeat and talked about, openly, with his name and everything, and the website

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.720
kind of told him what the consequences might be of him using his real name, and he was

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:30.280
like, so what?

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:33.820
Apparently he went on and talked about these two different red ring to death scenarios.

01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:38.760
A reproducible crash that could happen in NBA 2K6 was one game that you could reproduce

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:44.800
the crash in, and apparently some dashboard update bugs in Dead Rising.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.740
Apparently he's being very standoffish about it.

01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:52.240
He doesn't care that the former employer of his wants to sue him and says, if they want

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:55.720
to come after me, bring it on.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.720
Very interesting.

01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:01.200
But, you know, he did probably violate the terms of employment that he had with Microsoft

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:02.920
and all these companies that he was working through.

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:07.520
I mean, you do kind of don't talk about the products like this, especially on a website.

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.700
It's a little...

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:15.760
I hope he knows what he's talking about, because he's gonna have to prove, well, yeah, I guess

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.480
he's gonna have to prove that he's telling the truth, so.

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:21.840
D'Artesuja says, wow, the cajones on this guy, yeah, for real.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:25.040
Rama says, did he sign an NDA that forbade him from saying this?

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.040
I'm sure he must have.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.200
If he didn't sign the NDA.

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.720
Unless it was specific, or, I don't know.

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.760
Maybe, but even still, though, I mean, they can get him on that, but at the same time,

01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:40.640
I mean, he's hoping to open like a whole other can of worms with, you know, Microsoft knew

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.960
about these defects and they didn't do anything about it.

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:43.960
Ah, I see.

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:44.960
So he's trying to be a hero, basically.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:45.960
Yeah.

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.960
Well, we know what happens to heroes.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:48.960
Yes.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:49.960
They become martyrs.

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:55.600
Well, let's hope it doesn't get that bad, but, well, there you go.

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.080
We'll keep you updated if we hear anything else in the adventures of this guy and his

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.280
soon-to-be legal troubles.

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.400
Well, something that might not be soon to happen, I mean, they're talking about it,

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:12.080
but I'm still thinking that it'll be out when another title with its name comes out, is

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.120
there are supposed to be a Duke Nukem movie.

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.360
Yeah.

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.560
Scott Fay, the one who's doing Max Payne, was saying that he's working on a movie scenario

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:32.500
that he thinks will do the character in the series justice, but I'm honestly really expecting

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:40.960
to see it more along the lines of when Duke Nukem Forever comes out, maybe, but he also

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:49.320
says that Depth Entertainment will be doing with trying to work on a few other cross media

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:58.160
franchises going into games and film, and they actually are still at work at doing American

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.840
McGee's Alice, and Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't doing that anymore, by the way.

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.400
Oh, really?

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:06.640
Yeah.

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:11.440
You know she changed her last name officially for her husband?

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:14.000
That's one of those Hollywood relationships that has actually stayed together, so good

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
for them.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.320
As a anniversary present, I thought that was really sweet.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:19.320
Mm-hmm.

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:23.280
Well, if you want to hear something even more ridiculous, there was a rumor coming around

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:30.000
about a Craigslist entry that said that they were casting for a Rock Band 2 TV show.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:36.240
Well, apparently it is true, and it's going to be officially launched next week, Rock

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:44.800
Band 2 The Show, and they also have some other stuff they're going to be showing as well.

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.340
I know they did something last night during the launch party.

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:54.000
They had Alice Cooper and Sebastian Bach facing off and stuff, but apparently there is some

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.440
sort of Rock Band show that's going to happen on MTV.

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.440
And what exactly will be on the Rock Band show?

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.440
It's basically...

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:05.000
Just watching people play Rock Band?

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.720
Basically you're going to follow, I guess they're going to set up some band teams or

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.720
whatever.

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.560
It's a 30-minute commercial for the game is what it is.

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:13.560
Basically, yeah.

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:17.680
Well, when you're MTV and you put out the game, you can kind of do that, so...

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:18.760
Besides, you know what?

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.680
I don't see this being much worse than some of the other programming on that station,

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.680
so bring it on.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:24.920
True, I guess it'll be better than The Hills.

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:25.920
So there you go.

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:29.480
Well, you know, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear about one of my favorite music

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:34.840
games jumping the shark and becoming a half-hour commercial TV series and reminding us why

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:40.320
MTV is a little bit poison for this series, or a lot of it poison, I get very angsty.

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:43.840
I don't know about you guys, but it makes me just want to get out the angst in a segment

01:43:43.840 --> 01:44:01.360
we call the FUs of the Week.

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:06.400
My FU goes to bullshit in the mouths it spews from.

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.400
Loki.

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.880
My FU goes to EA for saying that the Rock Band 2 drums are supposed to be out today

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:18.360
and not actually shipping the Rock Band 2 drums to anybody, so it's a big clusterfuck.

01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:20.060
Thank you.

01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:27.040
My FU goes to whatever little animal decided to crawl under our house and die because it

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:30.960
happened on, I guess, Friday when we started noticing that, hmm, something smells like

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.360
death.

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.740
So now the animal control people aren't going to be able to even come out until Monday because

01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:40.360
we think it's a cat, because there was a cat that was sometimes in our backyard that just

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:44.440
looked like hell, and it's not around anymore.

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:50.420
So you know, although I am sad for little kitty, FU to deciding to die under our house

01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:53.040
and not in, say, the neighbor's pool.

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:57.520
Come on.

01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.520
It's just gross.

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:00.520
All right.

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:03.120
That's it for the FUs of the Week.

01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:07.160
But boy, we get into some FUs of the century when we talk about some of the gaming industry's

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.660
biggest controversies they've ever had.

01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:12.440
This is on a website called MCVUK.com.

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.320
They ran a top 10 list this week of gaming's biggest controversies.

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.640
Hey, if you want to get your website on Dig, just add a top 10 list.

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:20.640
Seriously.

01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:22.840
That's all you ever see on Dig are these top 10 lists from these sites I'd never heard

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:25.520
of until I see the top 10 list.

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.360
So there you go.

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:30.640
Anyhow, here's a quick rundown of what the controversies are.

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:33.640
Number one on the list, the Night Trap.

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:37.560
Remember Night Trap when that was out on Sega CD, and it actually had video?

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.560
With Dana Plato.

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.560
Exactly.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.080
Dana Plato was fucked up.

01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:46.880
And it was just girls running around basically in their undies, getting eaten by monsters.

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:47.880
It was pretty violent.

01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:53.280
It was real, because it was like real video and all that stuff.

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.240
Gaming's biggest controversies, number two, Mortal Kombat, because it kind of, if you

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.520
think about it, started the ESRB.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:04.160
Remember when you'd see all those fatalities on the nightly news and everything about,

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.720
oh my god, so much blood, rivers of gore, rivers of gore.

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:10.280
You know, and then they're just, it's on the nightly news.

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.960
It started the ESRB, essentially.

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:14.560
So it was highly controversial.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.400
Carmageddon is number three on the list.

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.400
Carmageddon.

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.400
Well, Carmageddon, you know, and it was a little bit more in Britain, because, you know,

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:27.200
remember it went over to the BBFC, trying to get a certain rating, and then they actually

01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.520
banned the game and forced this company to remove all the gore from the film, or from

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:37.520
the game, and so they substituted green blood instead of red blood, very similar to what

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.160
happened with the sweat in Mortal Kombat here.

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.000
They got green blood zombies.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:48.600
Well, you know, in Samurai Shodown, for the US one, they put in, well, I think it was

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.560
the US one, they had sweat instead of blood, like in the Japanese one.

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.280
Yeah, a little silly.

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:55.120
And in the German one, they had robots.

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.680
Not even people, but robots that you ran over.

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:03.660
America's Army is number four, and it has to do with, you know, the game was developed

01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:06.560
and is being used as a recruitment tool.

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:11.120
But Ubisoft kind of has gotten itself in a little bit of trouble for publishing the console

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.200
version of the title.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.400
Apparently there was like a demonstration outside of their offices after this whole

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:25.200
thing, because they actually went and published a console version, and that was really bad.

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:30.500
It's basically a giant recruitment tool, which in a way is controversial in itself.

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:35.120
Number five was something called Murder by PlayStation.

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:40.800
Apparently it was some type of like story that was actually released, it was a headline

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:45.120
that was actually in a paper on the Daily Mail, and it was actually a story about a

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:50.800
14-year-old kid who was murdered by a 17-year-old kid, and the newspaper claimed that the kid

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:57.080
was obsessed with Manhunt, and by the way, police did say there was absolutely no link

01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:59.240
between the game and the killing.

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:05.040
But yet that headline, Murder by PlayStation, giant bold letters, still exists.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:09.360
Number six on the list, the guy game, remember the guy game, Loki?

01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.400
We covered the guy game on this program.

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:16.480
Guy game was awesome, except for the 17-year-old that got in it, that caused the game to get

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:18.120
pulled from shells everywhere.

01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:24.440
Dude, seriously, I mean, yeah, because tits on a 17-year-old really change a lot in a

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:25.440
year.

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:26.440
Seriously.

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:27.440
It's gay.

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:31.760
Well, I don't, actually no, it wouldn't be gay, unless you're a woman.

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:34.880
No, because that game screws another of the same gender.

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:38.600
It was just, I mean, obviously it's a big no-no, and very irresponsible.

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.040
It's her fault anyway, she lied about her age.

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.040
It's just irresponsible.

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.040
Dumb bitch.

01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:47.400
But the game, the game itself- They could be having guy game four by now.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:51.640
Yeah, if you cut this little element out of the game, we'd be on like guy game, you know,

01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:53.920
on Xbox Live Arcade, it would be awesome.

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:55.920
Hell yeah.

01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.520
Number seven, hot coffee, all I need to say.

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:03.360
If you don't know enough about that by now, where have you been?

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:06.400
Number eight was when the BBFC tackled Band Hunt 2.

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.960
Of course, there was all the controversy around that, and then that got banned, and then it

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.020
wasn't, and then the game sucked anyway, remember?

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:18.880
Number nine was Goat Gate, which is another way to refer to, remember the Greek god launch

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:21.400
party for God of War 2 over in Europe?

01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:24.160
And they actually slaughtered a live goat.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.800
Remember that?

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:31.160
I don't think that- Marketing genius over there.

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:35.000
Dot, dot, dot, that's all I have to say.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Dot, dot, dot.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.520
And then the other last controversy on the list, because I know you're all loving this.

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.560
Sony versus God.

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:48.400
And it has to do with the fact that the Church of England was actually used- Manchester Cathedral,

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:52.200
its church was actually used in Resistance, Fall of Man, and they were not happy about

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.200
that.

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.200
Remember that?

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.240
We covered that on the show a little while ago.

01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:57.240
So there you have it.

01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:01.840
The top 10 biggest controversies according to MCV UK, so it is a little more UK based,

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.200
hence why we had a couple of those in there, but I would say UK or not, those are pretty

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:07.680
good entries on the list.

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:09.240
Very controversial.

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:11.000
Anything you think they left off?

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.960
I think, remember the PSP ad that had like the, it was almost racist because it had like

01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:19.960
the white and the black, and it was, oh man, it was bad.

01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:20.960
Remember that?

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.720
That was somehow left off the list.

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:26.320
Just another brilliant Sony marketing scheme from the day.

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:27.320
Anything else you guys can think of?

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:28.320
I don't know.

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.320
I think they hit most of the good ones.

01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:34.640
But, alright, we'll see in chat, chat.orangelawnsradio.com if anybody thinks of anything.

01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:36.360
No Custer's Revenge either.

01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:40.200
There's usually a Custer's Revenge that shows up on the list like that.

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:44.420
Alright, let's see what you guys have to say in our mailbag.

01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:49.560
Every week you guys email us, mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com, and we read your emails here live on the

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:50.560
show.

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:59.400
We'll send you the old mailbag and see what emails we've got.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:04.720
First email comes from Cheeseburger and it says, sorry I got you mad last week.

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.600
Can you please tell me more about Gatchaman, please?

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.600
Did I spell that right?

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:08.600
Yes, she did spell it right.

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:10.600
Gatchaman is awesome!

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:16.440
1972 anime character designs done by Amano.

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:20.520
Just go look it up on Wikipedia and then go watch all of it.

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:22.360
That's the only way you'll appease me.

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:23.360
Nice.

01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:25.000
Hey, OLR crew.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.680
This is the next email, by the way.

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:31.560
After listening to last week's show, I figured right into clarifying what the Rob D was saying

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:34.600
about me shaking while at the mic.

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:39.160
It wasn't while at the mic that my hands started to shake, but after, it was a bit of a rush

01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:43.680
being on the air with a bunch of internet celebrities who are too humble to admit they

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:46.000
really are celebrities, however minor.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.720
I am not.

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:52.520
I am actually egotistical enough to admit my celebritydom on the internet.

01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:54.560
Curse you, adrenaline!

01:51:54.560 --> 01:52:00.200
Anyway, it was great meeting you all at PAX and was very glad that I made it to Wild Ginger

01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:04.520
that night in one piece as the food and conversation were awesome.

01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:07.000
Who knew mango could make pork taste like beef?

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.840
This is talking about the Chinese restaurant, all the games people went to, yeah?

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:12.440
As I ordered the mango pork and it was freaking fantastic.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:16.360
Yeah, the food I had was good too.

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:20.600
Plus I had to be the best Dan Padtai I've ever had, it made being lost in the scuzzy

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.780
part of Seattle at night totally worth it.

01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:26.360
That was a really good Padtai, I agree with that because I had some too.

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:31.560
I didn't just write to reminisce and sing praises though.

01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:35.080
A few episodes back you guys were talking about Dragon's Lair and Space Ace and they

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:39.880
should be put on PS3, well good news, not only are they playable on PS3, but any Blu-ray

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:40.880
player.

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.520
I've actually had them in stock where I work for quite some time now and I'm kind of shocked

01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:51.240
they aren't on shelves with the games at other stores as well, he put links on Amazon.

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:55.600
Actually I think, the reason I didn't get them is because I've already got the HD versions

01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:01.140
for PC so, but I hope I passed the Grammar Nazi test here.

01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:07.120
You almost did, but for right is WRITE.R-I-G-H-T.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.400
I can't wait until next year's PAX assuming I can go.

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:11.400
Cheers to Cypher.

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:12.400
Yay.

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.400
PS.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:18.360
This email was brought to you by the OLR Mailbag, home of the never-ending Olive Garden references.

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:22.240
I wish I haven't had an Olive Garden reference in a little while, but there you go.

01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:23.240
Thank you.

01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:24.240
Rob, let's go to Olive Garden.

01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:25.240
Dude, I really want Olive Garden.

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:26.240
We have to.

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:30.020
You know where I went this week was Corrino's, good stuff.

01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:31.020
I've never been there.

01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.020
Nom nom nom.

01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:36.360
I'd take you to Pasquale's, but I don't think they have anything light though.

01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:40.280
Or we should go to a little, they have a little joint here in Sacramento called Espanol, which

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.560
is the Italian place with a Spanish name.

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:43.560
It's really good.

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:44.560
Okay.

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:45.560
I have a very yummy minestrone soup.

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:46.560
Mmm.

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:47.560
Orange launch foodie-o.

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.560
Next email.

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.560
Hey, OLR.

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:50.560
Hi.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:53.520
I just have to say, I love that on this show when we're not talking about video games,

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:54.520
we're talking about food.

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:55.520
It's great.

01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:56.920
I have gushy foods.

01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:00.880
Ooh, Rob D says never-ending pasta is going on at Olive Garden right now.

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:02.560
Dude, we are there, okay?

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:05.000
Never-ending pasta doesn't mean no good anyway.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Hey, my email.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Sorry.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Email.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Hey, OLR.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.480
I read this on the FAQs of EA's new Sports World site, which is their online community

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:14.160
for their sports games.

01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:17.480
One of the questions is why there's no female avatar option.

01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:22.480
Their response was, quote, question, why is there no female avatar image?

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:26.480
In effort to align EA's Sports World with our primary user base, the decision was made

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:28.560
to use a male avatar image for its launch.

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:31.800
However, a female avatar image is planned for future releases soon.

01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:35.320
Is it just me or are they making an assumption about who plays their games?

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:40.880
I'm not a female, but I think that it is kind of sexist to gear a sports game towards males

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:46.160
only and assume that all the women are playing Barbie Island Princess or baked cakes, although

01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:49.240
cakes are great.

01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:54.320
Maybe I am completely stupid and don't see why this is okay, but maybe, no, but I'm sure

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:58.400
many women across the world play sports games and other types of traditionally male games

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.880
like GTA, other FPSs, et cetera.

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.120
Well, thanks for reading this, and remember, if you are in the all games chat room, DMN

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:06.340
can't kick you.

01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:09.120
The cake is live, PK Junior 92, Yaris sucks.

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:17.440
Well, you have to understand that until EA Sports releases, you know, Dinner Making 09,

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:23.920
you know, they're not going to have female avatars, unfortunately.

01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:28.040
The Rob D says in chat, translation, their response was, girls don't play games.

01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.480
Is this true, Dark Sakura?

01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:31.920
Do girls not play games?

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.000
I beg to differ.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
I had a feeling.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
I remember.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.920
I bet we have some more listeners out there that beg to differ as well.

01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.480
You remember, though, Rob.

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:41.480
What?

01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:44.520
Remember me telling you that there was a football game I actually liked.

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.520
Tecmo Bowl.

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.800
No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl.

01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:52.680
It was, um, great, now I can't remember, but it had a cool name.

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.840
It was that one football game that was, um, on Super Nintendo.

01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:58.560
Must have had a lasting impression.

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:02.260
Well, no, I can never remember the name of it, too, was the problem with it.

01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:03.440
Was it with the four player thing?

01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:04.720
Was it Super Tecmo Bowl?

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:07.280
No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl anything.

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:08.280
High Impact or something?

01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:09.280
High Impact.

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:10.280
Thank you.

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:11.280
It was Super High Impact.

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:12.280
I just had a feeling.

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:14.520
And I said that before I saw Dark Sakura say it and shit.

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:20.520
I was gonna say, also, that, um, yeah, girls don't play games and EA doesn't release games

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.960
that aren't buggy.

01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:25.140
That just means that girls play good games.

01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:27.240
You know how I feel about sports games, you guys.

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:32.160
Look, I respect those of you guys that choose to play them, but for me, Tecmo Bowl or GTFO?

01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.540
No, it was all about that hockey game on Saturn.

01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:38.540
Or Blades of Steel.

01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:39.540
Blades of Steel.

01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:40.540
Thank you.

01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:41.540
Thank you.

01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:42.540
Anyhow, go ahead.

01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:45.640
Hockey is fantastic, too, because, you know, blood bounces on ice.

01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:48.400
You know, NHL 09 came out this last week.

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.400
We should check it out.

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:51.560
I used to watch hockey regularly.

01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:52.600
Let's get into sports games.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:54.680
I wouldn't buy NHL 09.

01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:56.240
I want a rugby game.

01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:57.240
There's stories about it.

01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:59.160
I want someone to send me a rugby game, okay?

01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:03.820
Apparently it's got some sort of memory leak in the cache file on your hard drive and will

01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.680
stop working after a while.

01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:06.680
Oh, shit.

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.720
Imagine if we came on the show one week, and during How Was Your Gaming week, suddenly

01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:12.320
it's like Jamie's talking about, yeah, I played NHL 09 this week.

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:14.160
I'm like, yeah, I played Madden.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:19.080
Logie's like, I played Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.680
And then we'd, never mind.

01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:27.440
No, it would be like, I was gonna say, then we'd be AGI, but you know.

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.080
If you wanted to, sick burn.

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:34.800
If you wanted to do the complete role reversal here, I would be playing Imagine Babies, and

01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.960
Rob would be playing Yaris, and Matt would be playing the Tingle Game.

01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:40.960
Nice.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:43.360
The Tingle Game, seriously.

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.600
For April Fool's Day next year.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:45.600
All right, we'll have a nice email.

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:46.600
Nice email.

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:47.600
Hey guys, Dan Shadow here.

01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:51.280
I've been meaning to email you guys for quite some time, but I've been very busy lately.

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:52.280
Welcome to the club.

01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:56.900
If this email seems long, it's because with every new episode, there's a new subject to

01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:58.120
talk about.

01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:59.480
This segment goes to Rob.

01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:00.480
Hi, Rob.

01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:01.480
Hi, me.

01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:02.480
Who's this from?

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.480
Dan Shadow.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.480
Hi, Dan Shadow.

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:08.520
A while back, you mentioned going out to Long Beach and visiting the Queen Mary.

01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:11.480
I laughed when you mentioned that, because I currently live in Long Beach.

01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:13.520
Next year, I will be getting married on the Queen Mary.

01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:15.440
It's a big boat.

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:16.440
My wedding will be booze-themed.

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:17.440
Chew on that.

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:18.440
Aww.

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.440
I miss booze.

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.840
I also wanted to point out that I am your Brazilian listener.

01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:26.760
I haven't been there in 10 years, because, well, it's just better to live here.

01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:31.200
However, I will return next summer to have my new wife meet my family there.

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:32.720
Brazilian listener.

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:33.720
Awesome.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:38.200
I've been craving Brazilian grill.

01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:39.800
You don't even know how long.

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:40.800
You know what I'm talking about.

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:42.360
Like the Espritu's Place in San Francisco.

01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:43.600
I've never been there, Rob.

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:47.800
Oh, they have a thing like it in Sacramento now called Taste of Brazil or something like

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:48.800
that.

01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:52.400
And basically, that's where they bring the big slabs of meat on the swords and just slice

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:53.400
off a slab of meat.

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:54.400
Do we have to order in Portuguese?

01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:55.760
No, I don't believe you do.

01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:56.760
You don't order at all.

01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:57.760
You just pay.

01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:58.760
You have a little dial.

01:58:58.760 --> 01:58:59.760
It's a buffet.

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:00.760
Green means go.

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:01.760
Red means stop.

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:02.760
Sweet.

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:05.520
I don't want to be there when I'm eating meat again.

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:07.360
Thinking about playing Warhammer online?

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:08.360
Do it.

01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:11.840
I've been in the closed and open beta, and I can tell you right now it's worth it.

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:12.840
Here's an example.

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:17.040
Let's say you're a squig hunter, and you want to drop aggro.

01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:18.160
You don't feign death.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:22.480
Instead, you will piss yourself, and the enemy won't touch you after that.

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.480
Nice.

01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:28.520
Yeah, the orcs and goblins are on the comedic side, but if you want to be serious cool,

01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:30.080
then play as the high elves.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.720
I will be in the head start, so if you decide to get it, let me know, and we can play on

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:34.720
the same server.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.440
No, and the head server.

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:37.440
Sorry.

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:38.440
No.

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:41.640
It says, I will be in the head start, so if you decide to play, blah, blah.

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:43.680
On another note, I can't wait for LittleBigPlanet.

01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:46.200
That seems like a game that can't possibly get old.

01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:48.700
Oh, and Rotband 2 equals party night.

01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:51.440
This email is brought to you by Strong Bad.

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:55.120
Keeping my Wii alive with his never-ending style.

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:56.840
Very nice.

01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:59.920
You know, again, my only reservation about Warhammer.

01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:04.000
It's not that I don't think it'll be a decent game that'll fill my time, but I really worry

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.440
about picking up another MMO, because when I play an MMO, all my other games suffer.

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:14.800
I mean, go back and listen to my gaming weeks on certain episodes of

02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:15.800
I played Final Fantasy XI.

02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:16.800
I played Final Fantasy XI.

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:17.800
Again.

02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:18.800
I played Warcraft.

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:19.800
Again.

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:24.540
Now is especially not the time of year to get sucked into a new MMO, but I am thinking

02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:25.540
about it.

02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:26.540
Star Trek Online.

02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:27.540
Star Trek Online.

02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:34.360
And then, I have to admit, I read about the new Final Fantasy XI patch, it actually sounds

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:35.360
pretty awesome.

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:36.360
No!

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:37.360
Don't do it, Rob!

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:38.360
Don't do it!

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:40.160
They're fixing it so that you can level easier, finally.

02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:44.480
If you can level by yourself, then it's better.

02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:48.400
You can level, like, let's say you're level 12 and your friend is level 70.

02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:53.800
Your level 70 friend can cap himself to 12 and level with you, and you guys both still

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:56.040
get experience.

02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:57.880
So you can level at any level.

02:00:57.880 --> 02:00:59.360
Kinda neat.

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:01.960
I will say level 1 forever!

02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:02.960
Seriously.

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:08.240
I will not be playing this bullshit.

02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:10.240
Final Fantasy bullshit?

02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:14.120
Unless it's Penn and Teller's Final Fantasy bullshit, then I'll play that.

02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:16.040
I somehow don't see that happening.

02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:18.640
That should be a bullshit game, that'd be cool.

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.520
I do see myself going out and at least checking out Warhammer for a month or two before I

02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:24.480
see myself going back to fixy.

02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:27.200
Alright, next email.

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:28.200
Star Trek Online!

02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:29.440
Yeah, and then there's that.

02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:30.440
Star Trek Online!

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.480
I'm hoping that gets delayed to 2010.

02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:33.480
Star Trek Online!

02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:34.480
Alright, shut up.

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:35.480
Read the next email.

02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:36.480
Shut up and read.

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:37.480
Jeez, Rob!

02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:39.800
Yeah, we'll bite my big bloody left toe.

02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:41.800
Sorry, that's my right toe.

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:47.400
Hey guys, I've been listening to your podcast for about the last year.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:50.560
Even though I can't listen to it live because I have school.

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:53.600
You guys are my favorite podcast and I never miss your show.

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.600
I haven't been able to get a 360 yet.

02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.440
It sucks because my mom and dad won't let me get one.

02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:02.040
They think that I shouldn't get another system even though I want to trade in my PS2.

02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:08.680
Anyway, since I have nothing to do and want to save money, I've been playing free MMOs.

02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:10.440
Here are a couple and what they are.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.800
S4 League!

02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:16.720
This game is a third person shooter that has anime style graphics and these make it so

02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:18.660
you can do flips and other cool stuff like that.

02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:21.000
And that's at s4league.com.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.760
MapleStory!

02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:26.280
You probably heard of this one, but if you haven't, it's a platforming MMO that's kind

02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:28.760
of like Super Mario Brothers, but you use weapons.

02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:29.760
That's at Nexon.com.

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.080
Again, these are all free and really fun.

02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:34.880
Thanks guys, keep up the great work.

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:38.520
This email is brought to you by my Wii, PS2, GameCube, and any other system that I don't

02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:39.520
want anymore.

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:42.840
Home to the never-ending dust that collects on them because they're outdated and my parents

02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:43.840
don't let me trade them in.

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:44.840
Wow.

02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:45.840
Alrighty.

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:54.480
I also do have to commend you on your fairly decent sentence structure and grammar.

02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:56.040
Gold star for this listener.

02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:58.040
You get a smiley face.

02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:00.640
By the way, Rob D., I was snickering during that email because I read this comment in

02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:05.640
chat from Rob D. talking about Penn and Teller's Final Fantasy XI bullshit.

02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:09.680
He says, wait, so you want Final Fantasy Desert Bus?

02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:12.640
Dude, you know what?

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:15.960
Sometimes running from one end of the map to the other when you're not a high enough

02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:18.720
level to have a chocobo feels like playing Desert Bus.

02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:21.480
I'm not even fucking with you.

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.480
You know what?

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:26.840
My whole thing was when I did play the game and was too low to actually make it across

02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:31.040
the desert without dying, I skirted the wall.

02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:33.400
I was doing maze business.

02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:34.400
That's what you have to do.

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.560
Skirt the wall and you hide.

02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:38.080
Like, oh my god, it's going to kill me.

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:39.360
Okay, last one.

02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:40.360
Ready?

02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:41.360
Okay.

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:42.360
Dun, dun, dun.

02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:46.440
This is Rob Rod, who originated that joke.

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.440
So we have to give him props.

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:49.440
Props.

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:50.440
Hi, OLR.

02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:55.160
Well, I've been waiting all year for TNA Impact to come out and now it's finally released.

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:57.320
I see nothing but terrible reviews for it.

02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:02.080
Bad grapple system, only five slots for created wrestlers, only a handful of moves, and so

02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:03.080
on.

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:06.160
I really hope the other games I'm looking forward to this year, Dead Space and Silent

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:07.920
Hill Homecoming, don't suck.

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:10.660
How can a Silent Hill game suck, okay?

02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:14.960
So I'd like to ask, what was the biggest disappointment that you guys ever had to face with games

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:17.000
you were highly anticipating?

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:22.080
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:26.240
You know, I have to say, one of the first ones that jumps into my mind was Nintendogs.

02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:30.520
I hate to say it, it's not that Nintendogs is a bad game, but I just got so hyped for

02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.260
it at E3 that the bar got set so high that the game just couldn't live up to it.

02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:35.960
It really couldn't.

02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:38.960
I tried.

02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:42.640
I remember one time Dan and I, this is when Dan and I were playing a lot of wrestling

02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:51.720
games, and we rented, at the time, WWF, or was it, which one was the one that had Nitro

02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:52.720
for the wrestling?

02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:53.720
Hell if I know.

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:59.780
At the time, they were still, they were still the WCW and the WWF.

02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:02.440
I've like played two wrestling games, okay?

02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:03.440
WrestleMania 2000 was great.

02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:07.280
I played WrestleMania on the NES, when you could play as like Hulk Hogan and Andre the

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:13.320
Giant and Macho Man Savage, okay, I played that old school one, and then I played Rumble

02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:14.320
Roses.

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:20.120
Rumble Roses was great, but at any rate, Dan and I decided that we were going to rent the,

02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:24.040
no it was Thunder, that was it, I think it was WCW Thunder.

02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:32.300
We rented it, got it home, played it for ten minutes, and called the Hollywood or Blockbuster

02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:38.040
that we got it from, and took it back, and they let us take out another game.

02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:39.040
It was that bad.

02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:44.840
I just remember that that has been the one, even Spice World didn't disappoint me that

02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:45.840
badly.

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.920
At least you knew what you were going to get with Spice World.

02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:50.400
Yeah, sheiss.

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:54.620
I got a night of endless laughs with Spice World, just, you know, we were, I guess we

02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:56.800
were drunk, but it was really funny.

02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:59.760
There is one game that disappointed me, but it was a Japanese release only, it was Super

02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:00.760
Producers.

02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:08.600
Super Producers was a game where you manage a pop idol's career, and it just disappointed

02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:14.920
me because it was a lot more language-intense than I was prepared for.

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:27.940
Gears of War, Halo 3, Bullet Witch, and, oh there's one more, I know it, it's pretty ballsy

02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:29.640
putting Gears of War on that list.

02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:32.400
I didn't like it at all, I thought it was going to be really cool.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.200
Halo 3 I was just disappointed, it was just average.

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.200
Halo 2.5.

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:37.200
Yeah, pretty much.

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:45.600
I don't know, I'm trying to think if there's anything else, Yars, I don't know.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:51.180
Rob D in chat says Mega Man X5 disappointed me a lot.

02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:54.960
More recently, that Infinite Undiscovery, although I'm hearing if you can get past the

02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:59.440
first couple hours that suck, it gets a lot better, so I'm trying to force myself to

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.440
play it more.

02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:08.240
But now I have Rock Band, I just want to play Rock Band all day.

02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:10.200
And no other emails then, huh?

02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:14.060
Mailbag at Orangelaunchrated.com if you have some mail you would like to contribute for

02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:15.060
next week's show.

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:19.520
In the meantime, a little more gaming news, and then the Skype line.

02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:23.320
There's a couple hacking and cracking stories we have.

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:30.280
The first one is a modification someone made using the Xbox 360 messenger kit, and they

02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:34.600
turned it into a keyboard for the PSP, which is kind of cool.

02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:41.840
It uses just a little data port that you would connect your headphones to, and supposedly

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:47.600
right now he's writing some drivers for homebrew stuff, so that's pretty cool.

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:51.300
And then the second one is less of a hack, more of a mod.

02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:55.000
Someone has modded an NES into a toaster.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.140
And why?

02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:57.140
Because it's funny.

02:07:57.140 --> 02:08:00.580
Wait, wait, wait, they made a Nintendo out of a toaster, or they turned a Nintendo into

02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:01.580
a toaster?

02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:06.720
They put a toaster, they have a toaster, and they put a Nintendo inside of it.

02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:13.080
And it actually has apparently some LED lights in the case that light up.

02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:17.460
I'm not sure if it lights up red like it's cooking, because that'd be pretty funny.

02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:24.740
But yeah, NES toaster.

02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:27.560
Does it pop up and go ding when something's done?

02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:28.560
No.

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.560
Then what's the point?

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:31.560
It's a toaster.

02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:34.620
Oh, well okay.

02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:35.620
It's a Nintoster.

02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:37.560
Nintoster, huh?

02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:40.840
How would you like to get paid money to play World of Warcraft?

02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:44.460
No this is not some spam email, it's actually a tie into the upcoming story here.

02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:52.440
The National Science Foundation gave $100,000 to do a study for World of Warcraft.

02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:56.840
It's to an informatics professor at UC Irvine, Bonnie Nardi.

02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:01.320
What she's going to be researching is player gaming habits and culture, not only in the

02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:03.740
US but in China as well.

02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:07.880
Apparently she's already been out in the field actually looking at World of Warcraft players

02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:13.260
across internet cafes around Beijing, apparently talking about the differences in play styles,

02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:16.400
some of the similarities in the culture, kind of interesting.

02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:21.200
Here's a quote from the study, or from the lady involved with the study.

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:24.880
The Chinese have invented some interesting ways to play with the in-game economy, not

02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:26.400
the real world economy.

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:29.800
Ways that I have not observed here in two years of studying World of Warcraft.

02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:32.480
Chinese players are more attuned to the aesthetics of the game.

02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:34.260
At least they mentioned them in more interviews.

02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:38.800
They talked more about color schemes, animations, architecture, and so on more than American

02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:39.800
players.

02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:44.000
So she goes on to say that the Chinese players, they actually don't really play with the add-ons

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.080
and modifications.

02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:49.360
They like the challenge of the core game, whereas in America we like to mod our game

02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:50.800
to hell.

02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:51.800
Kind of interesting.

02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:54.960
She's getting paid $100,000 to finish this research.

02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:59.080
She's doing it along with a student going after their doctoral, and will be doing some

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.000
type of final paper that I'm sure will be published all over the internet when it's

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
done.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.140
$100,000 to study WoW.

02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:08.760
You can really get a job doing anything.

02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:10.600
No, I guess that's neat.

02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:12.280
It's just kind of like, wow, there's a lot.

02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.880
I guess, but then you think about the complex layers, I guess there is a lot to study, but

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:19.760
I'm just kind of curious what will be contributed to society from the results?

02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:23.800
Is it a way for us to better understand each other through games?

02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:25.520
Why don't people just actually socially interact?

02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:28.200
Oh, that's right, because people are scary.

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:29.200
Yeah.

02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.440
People are scary.

02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:34.260
Well how about some more news?

02:10:34.260 --> 02:10:35.260
How about it?

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:36.520
Would that make you giddy, Rob?

02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:37.520
Yes.

02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:52.360
Speaking, because we did have an email earlier regarding, excuse me, no, sorry, my, I stopped

02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:53.360
working.

02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:57.400
Yeah, it was Warhammer, sorry.

02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:03.540
There was an announcement put out that there are actually server types and server names

02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:06.120
for Warhammer Online, Age of Reckoning.

02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:13.360
There's Core Open RVR, which is Realm versus Realm, Roleplay, and Roleplay slash Open RVR.

02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:15.620
So that's pretty cool.

02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:23.360
It's going to have the standard gameplay, but you've got unrestricted PVP combat on

02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:31.880
the core server, and then on Realm versus Realm, you have to be flagged for combat to

02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:35.320
do PVP stuff.

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:40.560
You can also, though, permanently flag people, though, on the Open Realm versus Realm servers.

02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:45.280
And of course, Roleplay servers are basically getting into your character, Roleplaying.

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:46.280
We know this.

02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:49.760
Which hopefully they actually enforce, unlike in WoW.

02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:53.040
I mean, I guess you can file tickets in WoW, but it seems like you always get a bunch of

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:57.460
a-holes on there, and they're like, haha, RP, and it's like, dude, you signed up for

02:11:57.460 --> 02:11:58.460
an RP server.

02:11:58.460 --> 02:11:59.460
What the F were you expecting?

02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:00.460
I know, right?

02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:04.240
I've done a Roleplay server before for World of Warcraft.

02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:05.240
I had a lot of fun.

02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:06.800
I played a real bitch.

02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:09.440
Like that's, you know, any different.

02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:10.880
That's not Roleplaying, Jamie.

02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:11.880
That's real life.

02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.880
You see this ferret?

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:16.440
I do.

02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:17.440
Bend over, Rob.

02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:18.440
No.

02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:19.440
No, no ferrets.

02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:28.440
But anyway, those are the type of servers that are out, so that's pretty cool.

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:31.520
And I don't know which one I'm playing on yet, if I get the game.

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:32.520
If.

02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:33.520
If.

02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:34.520
Sorry.

02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:43.320
I was, I was fascinated by the fact that apparently they changed the name of Africa in, uh, Japan

02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:46.080
to, uh, Akuna Matata.

02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:47.080
I'm serious.

02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.120
That's the actual title now.

02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:50.120
Akuna Matata.

02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:51.120
Akuna Matata.

02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:52.120
Seriously.

02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:53.120
It's Africa.

02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:54.120
Disney will sue.

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:55.120
I guess.

02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:59.560
No, it's, well, they didn't make it up, but that's interesting.

02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:01.120
I thought the game already came out in Japan.

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:03.120
How did they change the name now?

02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:07.120
Okay, well, to be honest, this is the Asian reason, one, so I don't know.

02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.080
I would think that the names are the same, but I could be wrong.

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:16.880
No, it's Africa and Japan, but apparently for Asia, it's Akuna Matata.

02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.120
I'm seriously thinking about buying this, though.

02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:20.840
That is the fucking raddest name for a game ever, though, you gotta admit.

02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:21.840
It's only $54.90.

02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:22.840
Really?

02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:23.840
With three dollars?

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:25.280
But it's coming out here eventually, right?

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:27.640
Eventually, but, I don't know.

02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:29.280
I like things I can get early.

02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:30.280
Whatever.

02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:31.760
Anyways, back on topic here.

02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.640
Bioshock.

02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:39.960
It's a PS3 game now, at least it will be in October, and as with most PS3 games, it will

02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.760
require an install, but don't worry.

02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:49.440
That'll be an entertaining 10 minutes as you watch Rapture-related advertisements and music.

02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:56.720
Awesome, and the install size, a whopping 4.98 gigabytes.

02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:59.480
Sucks if you have a 20 gig PS3.

02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:02.760
That kind of sucks.

02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:07.560
Oh, and the graphics are about the same as the Xbox 360.

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:27.480
I wonder if this game is changing, which- is it too much to get the freaking chorus?

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:36.280
Ugh, I just wanted the freaking chorus, but the little samples on iTunes have the little

02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:39.080
chorus pre-versus there.

02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:40.080
Lame.

02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:50.400
Hakuna Matata, da da da da da da, Hakuna Matata- hey, Harry Potter!

02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:52.800
Hakuna Matata, Harry Potter!

02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:53.800
It's almost the same thing, right?

02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:55.360
What do they have to do with each other, Rob?

02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:00.480
Well, you know that the Harry Potter movie got pushed back to the disgust of 14-year-old

02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:04.400
girls everywhere, and some girls that think- no, I'm just kidding, obviously there's a

02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:10.180
ton of people that are really into Harry Potter, disgustingly so almost, and instead they're

02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:14.640
getting Twilight out in the movie theaters this Christmas, but Harry Potter got pushed

02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:15.640
back to next summer.

02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:19.760
Well, this should be kind of a duh, but the game got pushed back as well.

02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:23.240
That's right, EA confirmed this week that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the

02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:28.720
game has been delayed, and even though I would think the game is pretty much done, but maybe

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:31.160
they'll take some time to go back and tweak it.

02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:35.280
What's kind of sad about this, though, is that EA now is not going to get the profits

02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:37.900
from this game until their next fiscal quarter.

02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:40.240
That's a loss.

02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:41.820
Oops.

02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:46.760
So Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will be out in video game form when the movie

02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:50.920
comes out, summer 2009, and I'm sure a lot of you kids can't wait.

02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:53.280
Are we getting a Twilight video game?

02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:54.280
No.

02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:56.280
That's what I want to know.

02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:57.280
No?

02:15:57.280 --> 02:15:58.280
Where's that tie-in?

02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:00.560
It's, uh, I don't know.

02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:05.080
I want my sparkling vampires in a video game, come on.

02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:07.720
Vampires that sparkle?

02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:08.720
That's too cool.

02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:15.880
Hey, our Skype line's open at Orange Launch Radio, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:20.520
Real quickly, though, some last minute stories, Loki, I know you had something about EA and

02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:21.680
Take-Two, right?

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:22.680
Yes.

02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:23.680
The final nail in the coffin.

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:24.920
Breaking news!

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:28.160
EA gives up on Take-Two acquisition.

02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:30.160
It's official.

02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.520
They will not buy them out.

02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:36.600
And apparently EA has released this.

02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:41.640
Electronic Arts today announced that while EA continues to have high regard for Take-Two's

02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:46.800
creative teams and products, after careful consideration, including a management presentation

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:53.640
and review of other due diligence materials provided by Take-Two, EA has decided not to

02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:58.240
make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions with Take-Two.

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:03.320
Really, could it be all those times that they said, no, no, no, stop bothering me, no, no,

02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:05.480
no, no, no, no, no?

02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:09.000
Maybe it just took them going, la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
thing.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.240
I can't see you, I can't hear you, la la la la la la la la.

02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:19.040
Skypline's open 1-877-GAMO-LR, your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, we're gonna

02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:21.640
take some calls.

02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:22.640
We'll start here.

02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:23.640
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:24.640
My name is Aku.

02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:25.640
Hey, it's Aku.

02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:28.640
What's on your mind, my friend?

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:33.840
Not much, just chilling on a boring Sunday night, except for you guys, we're just making

02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:34.840
it all better.

02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:35.840
Thank you.

02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:36.840
Oh, yeah.

02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:38.760
Hey, you're getting DDRX this week?

02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:39.760
You're a DITR fan?

02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:45.720
Well, I'm on a wait and see right now, and since I'm unemployed and I need work right

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:53.080
now, I need to hold off on spending, you know, splurging money on, like, luxury such as video

02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:54.080
games.

02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:55.080
Well, that's definitely understandable.

02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:59.280
Yeah, you know the location just happened, you know, last week, right?

02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:03.000
Actually, throughout the better part of last week, it just ended today.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Oh, yeah, how'd that go?

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:12.360
Dude, uh, from what I've known, from what those folks were able to test out there, it's

02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:14.200
shaping up to be a pretty good mix.

02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:16.160
Now, I have a real quick question.

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:19.800
DDRX, isn't that supposed to be coming out soon in the arcades, or are they...

02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:20.800
Yeah.

02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:23.600
I mean, they tested the arcade, and they were testing it last week.

02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:24.600
Yeah, exactly.

02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:25.600
Okay, Rob, you remember that...

02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:26.600
What?

02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:29.800
Um, you went into that store, Gamer's Empire, with me, remember, by the Folsom Theater?

02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.200
I didn't go into it, but I...

02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:32.200
You know of it, yeah.

02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:33.200
I know of it, yeah.

02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:38.240
I've been in the front of their, um, store into an arcade now, and they have told me

02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:40.720
that they are probably gonna get DDRX.

02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:41.720
Well...

02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:43.120
That'd be fucking awesome.

02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:47.140
Well, it depends on whether or not they just buy the full cab, or the upgrade kit.

02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:49.640
It's gonna be the full freaking cabinet.

02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:51.320
They said it's really expensive.

02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:56.580
Remember, that cab that was used in the location test is not final, it's kind of like a prototype

02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:57.580
right now.

02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:02.160
It's a work, you know, it's basically a test pad for what, you know, what Konami is trying

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:06.400
to do, according to what the rep said over there.

02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:10.560
And they're ditching Betsy, which is great news, since now Konami is restarting their

02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:11.560
arcade division.

02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:13.920
Oh, I didn't know they were restarting it.

02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:14.920
That's pretty cool.

02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:19.220
Yeah, because that's, that's what the, you know, the folks, the guys who were running

02:19:19.220 --> 02:19:23.880
the test, you know, the folks in the arcade, you know, Konami's arcade division, that's

02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:26.080
what they were telling the folks who were at the test.

02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:27.080
Nice.

02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:28.420
They said we're starting over.

02:19:28.420 --> 02:19:29.420
We are starting over.

02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:32.620
Yes, indeed, yes, and that's how they mean it.

02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:35.680
Does this mean we might get Silent Hill Arcade Game over here finally?

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:43.160
Well, it means that no, you know, unfortunately we won't have that American incompetence holding

02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:48.240
back certain, you know, basically taining the good name of DDR with shitty cabs and

02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:49.560
just piss poor service.

02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:54.000
It means that Konami is actually, if they want, they're actually doing something right,

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.240
they're actually doing it themselves this time.

02:19:57.240 --> 02:20:01.440
Well, any other thoughts, Zaku, on your mind before we get to another call?

02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:07.840
Um, just the fact that secure ROM and EA is just, just killing PC gaming.

02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:14.000
Ah, yes, the whole DRM, I'm sure you can't run away from this discussion somewhere on

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
the internet.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.920
We were just talking about it with Bobby on his show a little bit, when we were doing

02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:23.640
the little toss over that he does at the end of his show, you know, it's, it's unfortunate

02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:26.460
that the people who are actually selling out the money to get the games are the ones that

02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:27.460
are getting punished.

02:20:27.460 --> 02:20:30.720
See, I was going to buy Command & Conquer, you know, I was going to buy Red Alert 3 until

02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:37.720
I found out that it was basically boiled down to something almost, almost akin to a rental.

02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:42.560
And that's something I'm not cool with because I don't want to be, you know, first and foremost

02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:46.560
I, there's no way I'm going to be treated as a criminal first.

02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:48.800
And then have to prove my, you know, my innocence.

02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:54.160
It's not the, you know, it's innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:58.080
It does, it does make me wish that the game would come out on consoles, you know, because

02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:00.600
it's sad because it's sad for PC gamers.

02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:04.920
I would want it, I would want to use my keyboard and mouse instead of the controller.

02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:08.360
You can use, technically you can use the keyboard on 360, it's just there's really only one

02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:09.360
game that it sustains.

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:12.080
Well the game, well the game support those two peripherals, that's what I want to know.

02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:13.080
I wish it would.

02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:17.760
If not, then I might as well just, you know, just skip it until they, they ditch the, the

02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:21.240
protections on the PC version, which is the one I wanted to buy in the first place.

02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:22.240
All right.

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:26.560
It just, it just sucks, you know, it had to be like that, but hopefully we'll, you know,

02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:28.920
we'll hit EA where it hurts, in their wallets.

02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:29.920
Well, we'll see what happens.

02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:33.200
All right, Zacko, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one, okay?

02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:34.200
All right, you too.

02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:35.200
Take care.

02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:36.200
By the way, thank you.

02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:40.720
Somebody in chat reminded me that I completely forgot to do the OLR pre-show Twit, because

02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:44.120
I did it for a story that came up a little later in the show, but we were talking about

02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:48.120
Warhammer just a little bit ago, and the server's coming up, and that the game is actually launching

02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:49.120
this week.

02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:54.240
So we actually asked this week on our pre-OLR Twit, which is available at our Twitter, our

02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:57.960
username is OLR, we actually asked people, are you going to buy Warhammer online?

02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:01.440
Are you currently a Warcraft player that's considering leaving for Warhammer?

02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:03.480
Here's some of the responses we got via Twitter.

02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:08.760
GS68 says, I don't play MMOs, except the real occasional Albatross 18.

02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:11.200
And I apologize if I mispronounce your names, guys.

02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:14.040
Dustoise says, I'm actually waiting for champions online.

02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:18.160
I love City of Heroes villains and would love an updated, better version of that.

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:21.760
Tiara says, nope, still waiting patiently for Star Trek Online.

02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:26.520
Pika Uno says, simply, hell no.

02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:28.840
Dartitsuya says, I'm just waiting for Diablo 3.

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:33.480
DJ Tyrant says, no and no, I've seen the war beta, and it looks very similar to WoW, and

02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:35.320
I'm not a huge PvP player.

02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:37.440
If I were, I might leave.

02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:43.320
Geovdea, sorry if I mispronounced that name, says, I'm waiting for Guild Wars 2.

02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:48.140
MistyOLR says, yeah, I'm with GS68, who said I don't play MMOs, 100% on this one.

02:22:48.140 --> 02:22:50.640
My damn attention span doesn't help things either.

02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:52.860
Quel Tipo says, will there be bards?

02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:55.640
If so, yes, give me a damn bard already, people.

02:22:55.640 --> 02:23:00.120
I hate to say it, but Fefixi has bards, and it's actually a pretty awesome class to play.

02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:04.120
ActDeaf says, considering that I was never into MMOs, Warhammer, even though it looks

02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:05.840
good, I won't be picking it up.

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:08.520
MMOs are never-ending repeat cycles.

02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:10.960
MeowFrog says, I'm not buying Warhammer.

02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:11.960
I may later on.

02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:13.640
However, I do still play WoW.

02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:16.080
I have friends who have canceled their account for Warhammer.

02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:18.120
I actually know people that have done the same thing.

02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:22.200
We used to do a big raiding alliance to do the 25-mans, and a bunch of them have quit

02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:23.200
to go to Warhammer.

02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:24.200
It's something else.

02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:29.880
Lastly, here's another one I'll probably mispronounce, SpongeTwang says, not buying Warhammer online.

02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:34.880
Currently playing WoW sparingly as is, using spare and spare time for DDR.

02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:39.460
So I'd like to point out, out of those 12 responses, not a single person said they're

02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:40.460
buying Warhammer.

02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:41.460
Uh-oh.

02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:45.600
But we did have people saying that their friends are getting it, so maybe it's not going to

02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:47.840
be a huge game.

02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:51.920
And certainly we have a very unscientific sample, but there you go.

02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:52.920
And thank you, it's GeovayDay.

02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:58.920
I just have to say it with a little accent there, GeovayDay, sorry for mispronouncing

02:23:58.920 --> 02:23:59.920
your name horribly.

02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:00.920
Okay, more calls, yes?

02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:01.920
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:02.920
Who's this?

02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:03.920
Hey, it's ParadoxVincent, what's up guys?

02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:04.920
Hey, ParadoxVincent, how are you?

02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:13.600
Don't forget to turn your radio down in the background, we were hearing ourselves a little

02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:14.600
bit there.

02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:15.600
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:21.640
Um, well, not much, I just wanted to give a big shoutout to you guys for playing, uh,

02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:25.720
I'm Having Trouble Beating Airman from Mario Paint, I really like that.

02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:30.000
That was all Jamie, she picks the background music you're going to hear when she does the

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:36.480
Classic Game of the Week, so a nice little reference there to other great gaming things.

02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:40.060
Yeah, I'm pretty much obsessed with that song.

02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:43.780
What is it about that song that has you obsessed?

02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:49.920
I don't know, I just, well, I found it on YouTube a really long time ago, and I just

02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:55.360
kept listening to it and kept listening to it, and it's just a nice little Japanese rock

02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:02.000
song from some Japanese indie band, and it's about Mega Man and I can't go wrong with that.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.240
It sounds like you could go on a Mega Man game though, right?

02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:12.000
Maybe Mega Man 10, they should have a best of, Mega Man All Stars, as the best monsters

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:13.000
from all the games.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.480
Do you like watching the videos that they make for these?

02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:22.080
I don't know if you heard that, do you like watching the videos that they make for these?

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:28.920
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's my favorite part, that's one of my favorite parts of those little videos,

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:33.840
I don't exactly know if they just hand animated them or if they're all pixeled, but yeah,

02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:36.200
that's one of my favorite parts about it.

02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:39.320
Alright, well, very cool.

02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:41.200
Anything else you've been playing lately?

02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:47.840
Yeah, actually, well, I mean, I haven't really been playing it, but, well I guess I have,

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:53.800
a few weeks ago I went over to a party and I really started playing on my friend's PS3,

02:25:53.800 --> 02:26:01.840
and I used to really bash the PS3, but you know, lately, and he sat me down, and, can

02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:04.560
I do a really quick plug here?

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:07.160
Sure.

02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:15.520
It's my friend's website, his name is Frank Castle, and he runs this community called

02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:17.840
Arizona Hobbyist Paradise, what?

02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:21.880
He's not the Punisher, is he?

02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:22.880
Yeah.

02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:27.160
Frank Castle is the Punisher's name, sorry.

02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:28.160
Nice.

02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:30.680
Alright, so he runs a comic thing in Arizona?

02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:41.160
Yeah, well it's called Arizona Hobbyist Paradise, and it's at hobbyistparadise.com, and it's

02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:47.480
just for like AZ Arizona people who like gaming, anime, and comics, but I was playing on his

02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:53.640
PS3, and then he sat me down, and then he's like, you know, the PS3 is starting to really

02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:57.760
gain a lot of ground in the gaming industry, and I obviously disagreed with him, but then

02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:03.760
he showed me this big list, and I mean, I'm looking at the PS3 exclusives right now, and

02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:08.800
it used to kind of be like the big joke of gaming, but I'm really thinking about picking

02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:11.200
up a PS3 really soon.

02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:15.360
I do want one for LittleBigPlanet and Home, definitely has me curious, but I think Sony

02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:19.320
still has a long way to go, and that's kind of been a theme with them lately, and that's

02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:22.680
kind of worrisome, you know, they were allowed to do a little bit of a slow launch with the

02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:27.720
PlayStation 2, because, you know, it was really the only thing out there, if I remember, I

02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:31.840
don't know when it first came out, but with the PSP, you know, there wasn't a lot of must-have

02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:35.680
games on the PSP, and a lot of those patches that enabled the internet and all those things

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:38.240
came out a long time after the release.

02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:41.920
Remember, the PSP didn't do a whole lot when it was first released, I mean, yeah, it played

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:45.320
music, but the memory on it was so little.

02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:53.160
It's interesting to see that Sony's consoles have taken a long time to grow, just interesting.

02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:58.840
I'm wondering, have you ever heard of the, I think it's, yeah, The Last Guy?

02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:00.440
Um, no.

02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:04.400
Yeah, it's The Last Guy, it's that one that was like that game in work time fun.

02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:05.400
Oh!

02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:07.440
The one where it uses like the Google Map-esque stuff.

02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:12.800
Oh, okay, yeah, I think I remember hearing about this on a previous show, yeah.

02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:17.560
And also, uh, Hane, Hane looked pretty, it looked interesting.

02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:22.160
Eh, I hear it's a little silly, but okay, I mean, it's different.

02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:31.280
I just think that, and Hane, if I'm not mistaken, isn't that a title that you buy on the PlayStation

02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:32.280
Network?

02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:33.280
Yes, it is.

02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:36.160
That's one of those games I think that you can now get on your PSP as well through the

02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:37.160
whole little...

02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:38.160
No.

02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:39.160
No?

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:40.160
It's not?

02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:41.160
No.

02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:42.160
I thought it was.

02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:43.160
So, cause you know how some of those PlayStation Network games are coming on the PSP, like

02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:45.160
Flow was one of them, I know?

02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:46.160
Yeah.

02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:47.160
That's interesting.

02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:48.160
Yeah.

02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:49.160
Echo Chrome.

02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:53.360
Alright, well, anything else, Paradox Vincent, before we let you go?

02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:54.640
Um, not all that much.

02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:57.360
Alright, well, have a good one, buddy.

02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:58.360
You too.

02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:00.160
Next time I see you, I'll break your arms.

02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:01.660
Oh, ow.

02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:02.660
Why would you do that?

02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:03.660
That's mean.

02:29:03.660 --> 02:29:05.920
Zondief would do it.

02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:07.840
Oh, okay.

02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:09.640
Why would someone threaten to break my arms?

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:13.200
Now if my arms really do get broken, I have it on tape, and I can sue.

02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:19.120
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:20.120
All one word.

02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:22.720
We've got time for maybe like one more call, I think.

02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:24.720
We'll probably do tonight.

02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:25.720
Alright.

02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:28.760
Hey, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:29:28.760 --> 02:29:31.640
Hi, it's SSJ100Matt from New York.

02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:34.640
Well hello SSJ100Matt from New York, how are you?

02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:35.640
I'm good, thanks.

02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:40.320
I was just thinking the other day, I miss New York City.

02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:41.320
You should definitely come.

02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:44.160
I want to come back and visit, I just don't know when I'm realistically going to make

02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:47.300
it happen, cause I'm very likely taking two trips to LA.

02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:51.200
There is a very small chance I might be able to pull through and do BlizzCon after all,

02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:54.680
but more on that when I find out for sure, I don't want to jinx it.

02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:55.680
So we'll see.

02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:58.840
Well what's on your mind, buddy?

02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:04.800
Well first off, I wanted to profess my love to Castle Crashers.

02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:08.300
I think everyone who has a 360 needs to get it now.

02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:10.800
What is it about Castle Crashers that you love?

02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:14.920
I don't know, it just brings back my old love of the classic beat-em-ups like Turtles in

02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:15.920
Time.

02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:17.880
Turtles in Time is great.

02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:20.120
It just reminds me of that.

02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:24.760
I don't know though, the demo kind of got a little old for me, but I need to get the

02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:29.520
full version I think, cause it does look like the little other aspects of upgrades and roleplay-esque

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:31.920
elements they put in there look kind of cool.

02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:34.840
I didn't want to review the game based off a demo alone, especially when everybody else

02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:36.880
is saying such wonderful things about it.

02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:39.560
Also I've been playing the game by myself, and I imagine it's the type of game that's

02:30:39.560 --> 02:30:41.400
much more fun with more people.

02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:43.920
But I hear online it's broken.

02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:44.920
Yeah online it's broken.

02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:48.600
You know what, I haven't really been playing online, mostly my friends have been bugging

02:30:48.600 --> 02:30:49.600
me to come play.

02:30:49.600 --> 02:30:55.760
I'm actually getting texted right now asking to come over and play it.

02:30:55.760 --> 02:31:02.960
But yeah, it's lots of fun, and it's kind of a good party game if you have a group of

02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:05.600
people who are all about it.

02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:07.800
Sure, sure.

02:31:07.800 --> 02:31:10.960
And Rob D kind of sums up what I'm thinking, he's in the chat right now, he says, I'm enjoying

02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:14.000
Castle Crashers, but I'm not really digging the combat gameplay.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.000
I do like the art style and the music, but I'm not liking the characters or the attacking.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:23.280
Yeah, I mean the game's got a certain quirkiness about it that's very cool, that piques my

02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:24.280
interest.

02:31:24.280 --> 02:31:29.680
But I don't know, the old school Ninja Turtles arcade game gameplay kind of got old a little

02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:30.680
while ago.

02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:33.880
Well I don't know, maybe it's not too completely fair to say.

02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:35.480
When you waste all your quarters on it.

02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:39.440
Yeah true, true, very true.

02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:44.120
The other thing I want to talk about is, you guys kind of mentioned this before, is NHL

02:31:44.120 --> 02:31:45.120
09.

02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:46.120
Yes.

02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:51.600
And I managed to pick that up yesterday, and you know what, I'm a big hockey fan, if anyone

02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:54.560
who listens to Understudiation Live, I always call in about that.

02:31:54.560 --> 02:32:02.940
But no, I think this is one of the better hockey games because of the whole online interaction

02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:04.120
that they have.

02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:06.360
What's so special about the online interaction real quick?

02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:15.320
Well basically with it is, they kind of made hockey into an MMO, where you create a player

02:32:15.320 --> 02:32:21.920
and you can take them onto a custom team where you know, you can have a bunch of friends

02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:27.920
or like what we have with all games, we've decided to make an all games team.

02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:28.920
Cool.

02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:36.680
Does everybody play as one character on the team, or how does it work?

02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:40.360
You play as one position on the team, or player.

02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:43.720
So you can either play goalie, you can play center, you can play any position.

02:32:43.720 --> 02:32:50.400
You can all play at once, and you know it's lots of fun, and so yeah we're trying to rally

02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:58.200
every show to get some of their viewers on to make the all games team.

02:32:58.200 --> 02:33:04.000
So I think we got about a decent number of 10 people, and I think we got Hendrix on there

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:09.640
from Super Happy Fun Time Show, I think he's the captain on there, and you know it's just

02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:10.720
lots of fun.

02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:16.080
We've already played a couple games I think, we're ranked number 5 in the 11th division.

02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:17.080
Wow.

02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:21.080
Well if any OLR people want to get in on that, I know we don't have a whole lot of sports

02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:26.520
game nuts here, but you know I know there's some, where can they go for more information?

02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:33.600
Well you can go on the OLR forums, I posted a topic about that, or you can go on the all

02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:39.600
games forums under, you know, we're playing sports, some of that.

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:42.200
Alright NHL 09 online.

02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:43.200
Very cool.

02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:45.960
Alright well we got to let you go, we're going to start to wrap things up, but thanks so

02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:46.960
much for your call, okay?

02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:47.960
Yep.

02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:48.960
Alright take care everybody.

02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:49.960
Yep.

02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:50.960
Bye.

02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:51.960
Very cool.

02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:55.720
Wow, I think we've talked more about sports games tonight than we have like in a year

02:33:55.720 --> 02:34:01.280
on Orange Launch Radio, but that's okay, we want to give an equal opportunity to all games.

02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:04.560
Let's see, we're going to wrap things up here, but I did get a private message I wanted to

02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:05.560
read here.

02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:09.440
James Patrick says, talk about Dragon Quest IV real quick, it's coming out on the 16th,

02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:11.760
I'm trying to call but I probably won't get through.

02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:15.760
Ah yes, another Dragon Quest, you know if it's as good as the Final Fantasy IV remake,

02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:16.880
it'd probably be worth checking out.

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:20.720
I think a lot of people in this country played Final Fantasy, but not nearly as many played

02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:23.680
Dragon Quest, so I'm sure a lot of people missed this the first time around.

02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:26.400
I don't know, do you know anything additional about this title release, Loki?

02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:29.800
Ah, that's Dragon Quest, I'm not a fan of Dragon Quest.

02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:30.800
Really?

02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:31.800
Why not?

02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:32.800
You just don't like slobs?

02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:36.120
I just never got into it, I tried playing Dragon Warrior like the first one a long time

02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:38.840
ago and just never really got into it.

02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:42.040
I beat the first one on Nintendo, I was hardcore.

02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:45.600
Now granted I used the strategy guide to do it, but you know, I can admit it, I needed

02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:46.600
a little help.

02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:47.600
Rob cheated.

02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:48.600
I did not cheat!

02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:49.600
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:51.440
I had help.

02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:55.520
It was officially sanctioned, it wasn't one of those things where for a while if you bought

02:34:55.520 --> 02:35:00.120
the game you got the stupid thing free, the guidebook, which I always thought was a little

02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:03.360
weird, but I'm pretty sure you did through Nintendo Power or something.

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.240
Um, what was I going to say?

02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:06.240
It's been a long time.

02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:11.520
Yeah, I don't know, I didn't even try Dragon Quest VIII, remember, well actually-

02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:12.520
It was cool!

02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:14.900
Dragon Quest VIII is actually really fun, I want to go back and beat it.

02:35:14.900 --> 02:35:17.080
It was actually a lot, a lot of fun.

02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:21.800
It was like an old school Super Nintendo Role Playing game, but with like 3D graphics.

02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:22.800
Yeah.

02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.800
I don't know.

02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:25.960
It's not my thing, I guess.

02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:29.680
I don't know, I still have to go back and finish Lost Odyssey, so, I mean, shit.

02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:34.240
I am not buying any more RPGs until I finish Lost Odyssey.

02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:35.240
So it may be a while.

02:35:35.240 --> 02:35:40.400
Last- in all these like Square Enix, you know, offshoot games, you know, like Last

02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:44.840
Remnant and Infinite Undiscovery, I don't know if I should even try those, cause I mean-

02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:49.560
You know, I am being persuaded by a listener that Infinite Undiscovery may not be as bad

02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:53.160
as the first two hours make it seem, but boy, what a crappy way to start the game is just

02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:54.160
running from things.

02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:59.140
I mean, it's just, ugh, kind of frustrating, but I'm gonna try to, try to suck it up and

02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:02.120
try to get a little further, cause I like the part that I played at Penny Arcade Expo

02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:05.680
and that bugged me, like, why isn't the game as cool as I remember, was I, was it just

02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:10.600
that whole like, con, you know, like, you know how games always seem better at a con

02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:12.620
cause you're caught up in the moment of a convention?

02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:19.400
I don't know if this is, um, exactly a good comparison in its defense, but that's how

02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:23.480
we started Final Fantasy VIII is running from things.

02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:27.360
Mmm, I don't know though, Final Fantasy VIII kind of sucked too in its own way.

02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:29.880
I liked Final Fantasy VIII, it was alright.

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:33.000
I did not, you know, I feel- junctioning single-handedly ruined, or drawing magic single-handedly

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
ruined Final Fantasy VIII for me, so.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Okay, maybe that.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Alright.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.260
Anyhow, we're gonna wrap up the show, we gotta, uh, get on out of here, so, uh, we can't leave

02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:43.040
though until we get, uh, more last minute stories, I don't know if there are any.

02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:44.040
Yes.

02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:46.040
Like I can get on the internet?

02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:47.240
Oh, sorry.

02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:52.080
In case you were wondering if Rock Revolution for the Wii is gonna be good, apparently it's

02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:53.080
not.

02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:59.040
Just, you know, throwing it out there, um, Kotaku actually got to preview the game at

02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:06.520
a Nintendo party, uh, last Friday, and, um, apparently the game itself on the Wii, there

02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:11.220
is no peripheral support whatsoever, even if you happen to do own, like, a drum set

02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:18.120
for the Wii, you can't use it, and, um, you basically get three columns of, um, notes

02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:23.060
that scroll down the screen, and you have to use either the C or D button, and strum

02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:26.360
with- by moving the remote up and down.

02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:32.380
Um, apparently it's tiring, and, um, also I guess there's maracas in there at some point

02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:33.380
too.

02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:35.940
And, uh, sucks, and it's not very accurate.

02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:43.280
So, once again, Konami taking the cheap-ass route, I don't know, so that's kind of lame.

02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:49.880
And, um, of course, kind of on the topic of Nintendo here, they will not be at E for All,

02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:55.960
and, um, yeah, apparently they just didn't want to go, it's not in their plans, um, I

02:37:55.960 --> 02:38:01.160
do remember, if I heard correctly, that they're gonna be showing off their games there anyways,

02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:05.480
at like some Target booth or something, I guess they actually sell games at this expo,

02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:06.960
which is weird.

02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:14.600
And, um, Namco Bandai has said that they're planning on making more Xbox Live Arcade remakes

02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:20.800
of classic, um, arcade games, uh, much like they've done with Pac-Man Championship Edition

02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:22.800
and Galaga Legions.

02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:27.440
No word on exactly what they're, uh, planning, but, you know, more games.

02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:33.000
Um, one suggestion, I guess, says that the team is working on a Pole Position remake,

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:37.960
which is interesting, and this, uh, little bit, I thought I'd throw this out for you,

02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:44.600
Rob, um, it's not exactly news, but there's a Dreamcast console available on playasia.com,

02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:46.240
that's the Hello Kitty Special Edition.

02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:47.240
Yay!

02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:50.200
I've actually seen that in a store before, it's been out a while.

02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:51.200
Yeah.

02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:53.360
But they're hard to find, really, really hard to find.

02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:54.360
Yeah.

02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:55.360
So, that's it.

02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:56.360
Alright.

02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.360
Cool, cool.

02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:00.320
Well, we're gonna go around and start to wrap up the show, we gotta get everybody's final

02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:03.600
thought in order to do that, Dark S- ooh, excuse me, Dark Sakura.

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:04.600
Um, no.

02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:06.920
Or, excuse me, Bob.

02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:07.920
No.

02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:08.920
No?

02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:09.920
No final thought?

02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:10.920
No, my final thought is no.

02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:11.920
No.

02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:14.280
Alright, uh, Loki, your final thought?

02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:19.120
Um, I somehow dismissed the show role, but I was gonna mention it real quick, uh, Team

02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:24.120
Icos were revealing a new game, The Queen, apparently.

02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:25.120
The Queen of what?

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:26.120
England?

02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:27.120
It's just called The Queen.

02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:28.120
France?

02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:33.000
It says, uh, Tokyo Game Show teaser website calls the game, Ico 3, The Queen.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.640
Alright.

02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:37.000
Which begs the question, what was Ico 2?

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Mmm.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:41.040
I don't remember an Ico 2.

02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:42.040
Maybe Shadow of the Colossus?

02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:43.040
I don't know.

02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:44.040
He has some people say that.

02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:48.840
But, uh, apparently it's gonna be Tokyo Game Show, so that's kind of exciting, um, and

02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:55.320
also my final thought is that I got to the bottom of why those rock band drum sets weren't

02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:56.320
out there.

02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:59.840
Maybe they released a press release on the 10th, saying that they're coming later in

02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:00.840
the week.

02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:06.840
I somehow missed that, so that'd be why no one has them yet.

02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:12.520
Um, my final thought for those of you in chat room discussing this game right now is it's

02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:15.200
Treasure Hunter.

02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:16.200
Not a thief.

02:40:16.200 --> 02:40:18.680
Uh, alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's show.

02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:21.520
We're gonna wrap up and, uh, get on out of here.

02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:25.440
Um, just let us say thank you very much for tuning into, um, our show and downloading

It's by word of mouth.

02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:35.880
We're not, uh, cool enough or rich enough to have, uh, broadcasting and, uh, really

02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:40.520
big corporate website backing us, but that just, uh, lets you guys know that, um, you

02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:42.800
know, we're, we're unfiltered.

02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:43.800
We're the real deal.
