Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, September 21st, 2008

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Warcraft's expansion finally gets a release date

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Could Metal Slug get re-released in high definition?

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And Animal Crossing undergoes a strange name change overseas

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
We are that podcast on the internet

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
And the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
We always tape live on Sunday nights

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
At about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
On AllGames.com

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Although we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
The show before us, The Bobby Black Wolf Show

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Ran over just a smidge

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
But that's kind of our fault

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Because we're always on at the end of his show

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
And then we had a little teeny weeny snafu

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Transitioning between shows

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
So we're a little bit late start tonight

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
But we are live and running

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
And my name is Rob Roberts

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I join you here every week on the program

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
And also join you every week

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Say hello to the one and only

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Jamie Summers

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Hi

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
How are you doing, Jamie Summers?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I have no voice

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Did you eat a frog?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
No, I didn't

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
What happened?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
When it got a little bit cooler here

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
The wind picked up and blew all of the pollen around

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
And well, I'm very prone to sinus infections

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And I'm trying to fight off one

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
You know what you need?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
A SARS mask

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
You know what I need?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
What?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Power thirst

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
It's made from lightning

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Awesome

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Alright, so also say hello to the one and only

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Techmaster Loki

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yes

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Knock it off

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Sorry, Loki, not you

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
What's up, Loki?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Not much

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
I figured out why that song cut off pre-show

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Okay, hold on

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
We gotta explain now

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
For the people listening on the podcast

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Before we go live

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
We always like play a song

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
To kind of transition from the previous show

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
To our show

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
And tonight was

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
What is this?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
A Funk to the Past

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Was the song that we played

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Yes, Ninten-sploitation

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Uh-huh

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Nintendo-sploitation

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
It's by

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Lime Mutterplucken B

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Is the name of the guy that does it

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Unique

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
It all

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
They all flow together each song

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
So that's why part of the song is on another track

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Gotcha, because I was like

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Why is that song cut off?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
That's weird, okay

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
But it's one of those CDs that transitions

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
From song to song

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
I get it

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Alrighty

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Well, if you would like to join us

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And give your input on the show

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
It's not just a clever name

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
So we are going to get into tonight's show

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
We always kick it off with a little bit of insight

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
On our gaming weeks and the games we've been playing

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Um

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I played Ragnarok

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Ragnarok

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
And um

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
No, I played something else

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Here's my occasional question on

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Where's Ragnarok 2?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Whatever happened to Ragnarok 2?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It's in beta still

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Still?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Hasn't it been beta for like a year and a half?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Usually it's been forever

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Do you know how long the first Ragnarok was in beta?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
A long, long time?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I played the beta for about three years

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Geez

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Wow

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Alright

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
So, no, no, not three

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It was about

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
No, it was about two years that I played the beta

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Because I started on the

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
The first closed beta

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I think

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Or before

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
No?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah, the first closed beta

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
So a long time

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
So, wow, geez

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
I'm sorry you haven't tried to get in on that beta

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
It's just something about you have to have a Korean

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Equivalent of a social security number to get in

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I also looked more into it

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And the only thing that I'm really interested in is the soundtrack

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
It's done by Yoko Kanno

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh nice

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah, I mean

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
As soon as I can find a reliable way to give it a go

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I might try, but for right now

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
There's emulated ways

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Alright, fair enough

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Well, if that's it for your gaming week

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Then, Loki, how was your gaming week?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Um, it was alright

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I played

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Not a whole lot this week

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Mainly

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
I played a lot of things

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Grand Theft Auto IV, of course

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Trying to keep on my winning streak

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
But there was a day that I let it get away from me

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
For a game or so

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
But it's back now

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
So I'm still on my winning streak

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And then, um

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I played

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Some more Mercenaries 2

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
And I swear

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
The more I play that game

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
The more broken it gets

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
But it's kind of entertaining

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Just to see how bad

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
The glitching will get

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
And so I'm about

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
To get my way through it now

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
And then

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I also played

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Pure, which is pretty fun

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It's an ATV off-road racing game

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Kind of a little similar

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
To Excite Truck, sort of

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Um

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Controls aren't exactly as tight as Excite Truck

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I mean, it's a little bit more realistic

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
But, um

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You know, a lot of flying through the air

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And doing tricks and stuff like that

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And lots of nitrous, so it's fun

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
But, um

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah, that's pretty much it so far

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Alright, well

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
My gaming week, I actually played something new

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
This week, I went out and got a copy

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Of Warhammer Online

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I decided I was gonna take the plunge and go ahead and

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Start playing another MMO

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
So I went and grabbed myself a copy of Warhammer Online

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And, um

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I don't know, MMOs are really hard to evaluate

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
You know, it takes a long time because there's so

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Much depth to them

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
That they can take a long time to evaluate

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
And I'm not sure what my full opinion of Warhammer Online is

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I'm still playing it, so that must be a good sign, right?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I had a friend of mine quit after playing it for

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
About ten minutes

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Saying it was garbage

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
So, I mean, I guess I was into it long enough

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
To keep going past that

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
So, you know

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Here's the thing, I'll start with what I don't like

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
About the game

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I actually don't care for the graphics

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Even though some of the textures are very pretty

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And some of the shadow is very cool

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
For some reason, Warhammer

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Feels really clunky to me

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Really clunky

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
There seems to be delay in some of the things I do

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And, you know, you could blame my computer's

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Performance, but seeing as I just got a new

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Quad-core 6GB RAM computer

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't think it's necessarily the computer's

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Specs that are slowing it down

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
You know, it's just

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
The interface feels a little clunky to me

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
It's not so bad that the game

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Really suffers because I still

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Will play it and everything

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
But it's a little bit clunky to me

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And, I don't know, sometimes I find

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
The interface to be messy, but it's highly

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Highly customizable, which is cool

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And they really encourage people to customize this, that's cool

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Alright, so, some of the things I do like about the game now

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I do like kind of the way

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
That the game seems to be kind of

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Split off into these three

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Different areas, you have your PVE

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Stuff, which feels pretty much

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Like Warcraft, you know, and it's

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Go to

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Guy with exclamation point overhead

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Or in this case, a little book with

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
A green book, get quest

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Go do quest, turn in quest

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
You know, it's very, very similar to

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Kind of the

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Warcraft, but what I thought was

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Kind of cool was now the different branches

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
That the game would go down, and that was something

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Called Realm vs Realm, which is

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Similar, I guess you could say, to PvP

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Like, for instance, one of the

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Realm vs Realm things I got into was

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
This thing where it's

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
For those that have played Warcraft, it's very

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Similar to Arathi Basin

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
But you only have two nodes, and for those that are playing

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Warhammer, I'm describing Kain's Embrace

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I think that's how you say it

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
But what's kind of cool about it, what I really liked

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Is that, okay, so you have, you know, the order

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And you have chaos, and you're trying to capture

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Both the nodes, and when one

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Team captures both nodes

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
What's really cool is that it sets off this

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Giant, like, alarm, like you hear

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
A rrrrrrrrr sound, and then

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
After ten seconds, giant

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Explosions happen at both

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
The nodes to kind of reset the board

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
So, like, you'll see one team captures the nodes

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And then you'll hear the big horn

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And then you'll see everybody start running away

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Because they want to get out of the explosion

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Because if you get into the explosion, you instantly die

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
And I actually had a lot of fun with it

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
It was cracking me up, and I thought it was actually

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Really well done, so I can

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Tell already that the PvP

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
In this game is pretty well thought out

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
And done really well, and I

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Really like the fact that the game kind of

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Gives you buffs, so that, like, let's say

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
This particular

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
RVR experience

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Is a one versus ten

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
They call it ranks in Warhammer, but you notice

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Levels, let's say it's a level one

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Through ten, you know, RVR

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Instance, everybody gets bumped up

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
To rank eight, so that way

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
You know, even if you're kind of lower

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
You get the stats of a rank eight character

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
So that way the playing field seems a little

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
More level, it seems like they've really

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Kind of tested this out and really

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Kind of tweaked the PvP in this

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So I think if you're, like, a PvP player mostly

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
You're gonna be drawn to

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Warhammer, I think, a lot more

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Than WoW, and Warhammer does

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Have some PvE elements in it

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And the other thing, kind of the other road that Warhammer

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Goes down that I thought was kind of cool was the idea

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Of public quests, which is

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Kind of neat, like, you can go into an area

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And there might be an event going on, and again

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
To compare this to Warcraft, because that's what, you know

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I just do that because that's what most you MMO players

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Know, I would say, like, imagine

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
You could just walk into a 25 man

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Raid and walk out as you please

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
That's kind of what a public quest is

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
You'll go into an area and there might be an event

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Going on, like an early event that I played

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Was one where you kill 30

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Guards, then you protect 30 guards

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Then you have to kill a giant dragon

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
And his Beastmaster, and like that

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Whole event kind of goes on, it takes about 15

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Minutes to complete, and you can run in and play

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
As much or as little as you want

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
But the more you participate in it, the better

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Your role is going to be for the loot at the end

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
And then as you play it, your reputation

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Kind of goes up slowly

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Does Beastmaster have a pair of ferrets?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
No, he does not have a pair of ferrets

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
He's the Beastmaster over, like, a dragon

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
There might be a ferret Beastmaster later in the game

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I don't know, but uh...

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Are they called Kodo and Podo?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
No. But yeah, I thought that was kind of neat

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
That you could slowly gain the

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
You know, kind of the experience that way

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
So there's many different ways to

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Experience in the game and different types

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Of, you know, you have your

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Renown is one

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And then your experience

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
You meet the different things to accomplish

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
But, like, I haven't really gotten a chance

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
To tackle the crafting

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
So I feel like there's still a lot more of this game

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
For me to explore

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And the MMO is early

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
So, you know, while I might be criticizing

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
The graphical interface and these sorts of things

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Early on, there's gonna be

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Patches that will probably fix a lot of the stuff

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
That bugs us. I mean, let's face it

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Pretty much any MMO has a lot of issues

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
When it first launches. So that's another reason

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Why I'm like, hmm, I can't really

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Review this game in full yet

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Because it still has a long way to grow

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And develop. But I will say this

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
If you're a PvPer

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
You really like the player versus player stuff

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I think you're really gonna enjoy Warhammer

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Even if you're more of a PvE type person

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
There's something worth

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Checking out here for you. Like, I'm usually not a big

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
PvPer, but I thought it was set up enough where

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I didn't feel like

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I was wasting my time

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
If that makes sense. Like, I was having a good time

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
And I was enjoying the game. And that's really what it comes down to

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So I do recommend

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
If you like MMOs, check out Warhammer

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Online. At least do your research

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Check into it. See if it's something you like

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Sadly there's no trial for it, really

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And I think that's one thing they're severely lacking

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
And they need to get up and running in the next 60 days

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Is get a trial for the people who really

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Want to check out what this game's all about

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Because they can get away with it for right now

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Because the game's got a lot of hype and they're gonna have a lot of initial user base

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But I really think if they want to

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Really try to sway people

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
They're gonna need to have a trial similar to

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
What Warcraft has where you can experience the first

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
20 levels or so. I think that's what

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Warhammer badly needs. Would you guys check out

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Warhammer if they had something like that?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Where you didn't have to drop the dollars to check it out? No? Why?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I'm not at all interested in Warhammer

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
You're not really a big, big MMO player

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I mean, you play Ragnarok, but you haven't enjoyed

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
A lot of the other MMOs you've played. You didn't enjoy

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Warcraft, you didn't. That's different.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
That's a space one. But I actually

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I liked World of Warcraft until

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It turned out that it just wasn't worth my time

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Loki?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, I don't play MMOs right now

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And even when

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
My wife joins Warcraft, I may not

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Do that. Alright, fair enough.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Although when APB comes around

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
We'll talk again

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Alright, well that's it for my gaming week, otherwise

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Just pretty much Rock Band 2 and games you've heard me

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Talk about before. So

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And tonight for housekeeping, Loki wants to

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Talk about olrpsp.com

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Well, I was just gonna say that I have a thread

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Up in our forum right now

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Basically

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Allowing you guys to

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Submit banners

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Because if you notice on the

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Olrpsp all games radio player

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
That there's a little banner

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
That keeps repeating, and you'll probably have noticed

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
That there's only three of them. One including

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
A banner for the PAX

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Coverage, which is way old now.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So we need more banners

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
And it's real easy

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Pretty much you can make a banner for

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You know, either one of the shows

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
On the network, one of the

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Inside jokes, something

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
You know, funny like one of the PSAs

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Just anything. Just pretty much

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Anything that's kind of show related

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Or network related

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Or indie production related

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Yeah, and basically

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Just 296 pixels

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
By 32, and

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Why is it such a weird ass banner size?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That's just the size I made it

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And there you go

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And all the details are on our forums

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And you can post your

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Images there

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Or email them to me

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And if they're decent

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Then we'll throw them up there

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And you can see the awesome

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Olrpsp.com, you can see this in action

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
On that great all games radio

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Tuner on the PSP

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Awesome

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Speaking of please for stuff

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
You know, we've been having to recycle a lot of the

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Audio bumpers we used during our free breaks

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
In the middle of the show

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
We haven't done any new stuff lately

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
So please if you have an independent show you want to plug

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
You host your own podcast or whatever

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Please send me commercials

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Fake PSAs, whatever you want to send

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
That's not for profit

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
We're looking for more stuff, we really need some stuff

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I don't think you're going to hear a lot in tonight's free break

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Because I don't want to recycle the same old crap over and over again

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Sadly I didn't have time to create anything new today

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
So we really rely on you guys

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
For some of the extra stuff

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Just send me an email or post on the forums

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
There's all that cool stuff on there

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Rhetortainment is in chat

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Reading some comments from chat, he says

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I have the latest version of the PSP hardware

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I tried to download the all games player on

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
OLRPSP.com and it didn't work

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Any thoughts on what might be going on?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I have no idea

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It should work, you just put it in this

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It's probably the directory that you have it in

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
You probably set it in the wrong directory

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Try downloading the official radio players

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Off of Sony's website

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
If those work for you

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Then I don't know

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
It's probably the same directory as those

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
But you test on the latest

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
PSP firmwares as they're released right?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
No

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Then again it shouldn't matter

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
They don't remove anything

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
From the PSP firmwares

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
To be honest I don't have any legitimate

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Firmwares

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It doesn't matter because they're the exact

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Same thing plus other added bonuses

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I want to read this comment

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
From earlier because I'm not sure

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
If it's on the right track or not

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Jamie also has bad memories

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Involving things like Warhammer right?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Is that true or not?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
The Warhammer with the little models

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Yeah

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
What happened?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I had an ex who would play Warhammer to the exclusion of all else

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Yikes

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
And I would have to sit and paint his models

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Do you think that he's gotten

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Sucked into this thing beyond belief at this point?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Dude I don't know

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
This is 12 years ago in Alabama

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It was worth asking

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't care what happened

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Was it Warhammer or Warhammer 40,000?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
It was Warhammer 40k

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Keep in mind

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
My review comes from somebody who has never

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Touched a Warhammer model

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Or done any of that stuff

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I did get vengeance on him once

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
How so?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
He had some sort of big figure that was

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
This hulking creature

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And I painted it hot pink

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Nice

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
That was pretty cool

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Well also pretty cool

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Some video game news!

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Loki, start us off tonight would you?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Alright

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
This time

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I think we may have talked about this a little bit before

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
But Rock Revolution

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
As if you needed more reasons

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Why it's not gonna be that great

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Well Konami says that they're not actually gonna put out

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Any guitars for it

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
So you're gonna need to find your own guitars

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Whether that be a Guitar Hero guitar

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
A rock band guitar

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Or you're just gonna need another guitar

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Cause if you don't own any music game

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And for some reason you decide this is the one you

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Want to start off with

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Well all you're gonna be able to get is just the drums

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And that's it. No guitars for you

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You know what do you think of this? Because at first

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I was kinda like laughing to myself

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Going, well geez this just kinda goes to show

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
About this game

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Then as I was thinking about it I was like

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
But at the same time I really don't need another freaking

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Guitar in my house

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
So in a way I'm thankful

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Not necessarily I mean they should

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
They have the option of buying the game by itself

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Or the bundle

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
But the thing is they're just not gonna make a guitar

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Whatsoever and that's fine if they don't want to do it

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
But I've had you know Konami reps

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Before tell me oh we're not in the

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
We're not in the peripheral business

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
But yet you have peripherals bundled with

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Your DDR bundles so

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
You're a liar

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Basically

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
But yeah they're not trying to be in the peripheral business

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Yet they're making a game with peripherals

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
So they're kind of

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Well plus the fact that

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
It's not like Konami's never made a guitar controller

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Before they just didn't do it

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Here it's probably they just don't want to make another

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
One they probably have reasons

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And it's maybe something to do with

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
You know the fact that they've licensed out there

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Designed for guitars

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
To other companies or something maybe there's something

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Legal

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
That we don't see

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Yet I mean that's part of the lawsuit

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Or something that's why they didn't do it

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
And that's why they only did drum controller

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Maybe I'm thinking

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
That's got to be the reason because if you notice the drum

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Controllers that they have out there

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
They're not exactly rip offs

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Of the original

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Drum mania controller

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Except for Konami's which is obviously

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It looks like kind of a rip off of the original

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Drum mania controller but they can do that since it's theirs

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And it sucked for the record

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Yeah so

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
That's my thing is that maybe they

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
These people are paying to license

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You know these guitars or something

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And I don't know

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Non compete thing or something I don't know

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
You know Bobby Blackwolf

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Is in our chat right now and he obviously does the show

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Before us here on All Games he says

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I find it funny this is news when Konami has always

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Said this Konami told me at E3 that they are

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Only making a drum peripheral and really

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
It's one less plastic instrument you have to buy

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And yeah I want to say Loki saw something

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
In the retail world that indicated this is going to be

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
True a while ago too but it's kind of

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Interesting because you see the trailers for Rock Revolution

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Hitting this week and there's really no

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Hint at this whole thing

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And what about the fact that people are going to be

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Buying this game maybe expecting that there's

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Going to be a guitar with it because that's what you see

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
In the other bundles

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Well it will just have to be very clear on the box

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
That it's not going to happen

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
You and I both know it will be in tiny tiny print

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Somewhere, guitar not included

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Well I think it's also you know the guitar

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Not included I don't even remember if they have

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Vocals in this as well I think

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
No they don't have

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Vocals in it before they were going to

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
But they accidentally

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
So it's just a guitar and drums

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
And

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I don't know I don't think it's a big deal because

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Shit you can buy used guitars like used

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Guitar Hero 2 guitars for like 12 bucks

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
So

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Doesn't really matter but

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I don't know

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Whatever do what they want to do the game is going to suck anyways

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Are you sure?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
And again

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Having not played it what's your basis for this?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
My basis for it is it looks cheap

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
All the videos I've seen from it look cheap

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
All the gameplay from it I've seen looks very cheap

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
It just looks like a cheap knock off

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
And that's sad because you know

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
They were the ones that pioneered this

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
But it's just a cheap knock off

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
What their problem was is they

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Did it right to start with in Japan

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
But they didn't realize that their American

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
User base would be interested in the same stuff too

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
So it was they started way

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Too late

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
And I'll quote Bobby that there is

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
One of the icons for the drum

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Is actually a dark grey

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Come on

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
That's retarded what were you thinking

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You know and I've said this on the show before

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I don't know if I want to continue to beat a dead horse

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
But you know in a way

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
If Konami is going to assume

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You know what happens about assuming

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
That this stuff is not going to

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Take off in America you know then they have

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
No one to blame but themselves for what's happening now

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I mean and this

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Sounds all conspiracy theory

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Like but I really think

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
That they're making this so that it doesn't

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Do well so that they can sue

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Them so they have reason

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
To say hey look your game is causing

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Our game not to sell

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
But

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I don't think that that

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Would fly in court and they know it

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
They'd have to know better

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Alright well let's see what you guys

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The listeners thought because OLR is the show

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
How long did they register any

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Licenses for Guitar Freak

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
For Guitar Freak Surger Mania

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
They did Guitar Revolution a while back

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Well they also had an arcade release of Guitar Freaks here

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
So you know that's years old

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I don't know if that would count for a console

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Well now that I think of it Guitar Revolution and Drum Revolution

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Oh Rock Revolution here we go

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Alright anyhow

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Let's go to the pre-OLR

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Twitter to see what you guys

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Out there thought and we asked on our Twitter

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Our username on Twitter if you're a Twitter user you should

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Add us it's just simply OLR

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Before every show we ask questions

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
This week we asked are you getting Rock Revolution

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Why or why not

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
DGRamaS said possibly problem is

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Real estate space but if the game works with

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Guitar Hero Rock Band Controllers then yes

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
And I think it's been pretty well known now that

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Yes it will work with both

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
So that's a yes

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Picaruno says hell no because that's the answer I gave

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Last time I guess during the show we must

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Ask this before once

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
The SEG said no I enjoy the

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Careful selection harmonics practices

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
In their set list they are game designers

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Of music so kind of going back to the set list

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
K Rose

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Says I won't buy it

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I only like Konami games for the Japanese music

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
If it's localized I'll get a better

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Rhythm band game like Rock Band

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Interesting perspective that you know they didn't

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Bring over anything from Japan so

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
There are folks that like that although I gotta say

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Though you're kind of a niche

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Market in that case you know

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I think it would be nice if somebody would

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Release a game that has some of the US stuff

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
And that but you're never

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Going to see a game released over here

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
It's kind of retarded about this too

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
The game only version of this is coming out in early

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
October the

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Actual instruments the drums

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And those bundles aren't coming until like

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Mid November

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Well Rock Band 2 is the same way

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Well they're just doing that now because they have the

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Exclusive for it but it's still

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Stupid because if you want to try their

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Unique drums or whatever how many people are going to

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Buy this game and just go eh

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Whatever you know I'm not going to buy the drums

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Now they're stuck with a bunch of drums

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Alright going back to the Twitter question

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Are you going to buy Rock Revolution

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
GS68 says I'm too ghetto to bother shelling

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Out the moneys for it. Act Def says no

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Because Konami failed to do this years ago and they

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Should have and they're not even offering something

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
At the level of Rock Band Guitar Hero

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Gold Anthro says no because if I was going to spend

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
The money for a game like that I'd buy Guitar Hero or

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Rock Band. Marin Marvel says

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
No it's too little too late for Konami to try to

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Jump back into the music game business in the US

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
They've already failed hardcore

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Joosten says all covers in an

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Archaic interface? No thank you

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Plus the drums look like ass. Konami

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Missed the boat years ago

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I can never say this name

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Giove Dea

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Giove Dea

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I think

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I got lessons on how to pronounce it last week but I

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Already forgot. I think it's Giove Dea

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
As DJ Rama S said

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Only if it works with the stuff I already have

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Javier Altman says

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Because we already have enough plastic

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Instrument stuff. Konami is

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Too late for their own good. The last Bossa

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
De Sanna has been played

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Sponge Twang says I will wait out

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Most likely into next year after

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The dust has settled. I need to figure which

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Plastic instruments work with which games

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
DJ Tyrant says depends on how good the

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Execution is since it's compatible

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
With Rock Band 2 Guitar Hero gear

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I might pick it up but they are very late to the party

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And lastly Chad28 says

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
No because they are mostly songs

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
That have already been used in other Guitar Hero

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Rock Band games and no Master Tracks

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
There you have it

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And um

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
So alright well we'll see what happens

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I mean it's really hard to make an ultimate

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Decision until the game actually comes out

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I would just if you're unsure about it

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Just wait cause

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
You know in the past there have been other games that haven't

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Performed very well and the price drops

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Come very quickly so

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Alright we'll see what happens

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Alright well let's move on talking about Guitar Hero

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Since we're kind of on music game news right now

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Very interesting story being teased this week is that

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
It was the CEO of Publishing

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
For Activision, Mike Griffith

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
He has actually kind of come out and said

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
According to Shaq News that

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
They might be looking at a subscription

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Model for Guitar Hero

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
So where as you know Rock Band and Guitar Hero

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
To date function with their download content

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Kind of like iTunes, imagine a system that was

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
More like Napster where it's more

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Subscription based

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Apparently 20 million individual

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Songs have already been downloaded for Guitar Hero

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Which is pretty impressive when you consider that

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
There's not nearly as much

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
As there is for Rock Band, I mean there's some good stuff

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
And not nearly as much

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Just it could be interesting

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
If especially if the timetable is

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Stepped up for the releases

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
What this annual subscription model could do

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
What do you guys think, is the subscription model a good idea

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Bad idea? I don't think it's a good idea

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Why is that? Because you don't know what's coming out

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I mean that's

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Kind of stupid, who knows what they're going to put out

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
What frequency it's going to be coming out as

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I mean there might be a lot of stuff that you're not

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Really interested in

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I would say you'd have

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I think the better deal is the way that Rock Band's doing it

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Where you have a bundle of songs

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
That you can pay for

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
And if you want all of them you get it like a buck cheaper

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Or something like that

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Or you know you can buy individual songs

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Because if you pay like say 60 bucks a year or whatever

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
For the subscription model or whatever

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
What if it's not worth it to you

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Because all these songs coming out

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And you have them and you're just like eh

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
What do you think, Dark Sakura?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
What if for a subscription model

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
If they had it like

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Okay you know how it used to be like if you did like

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
BMG music or something

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
How you would

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
They had their featured CD

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
And then you could refuse it if you want to

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And picked what you wanted to order

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
What if they did something to that effect

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Where they say this is our exclusive featured

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Track, you can only get it this way

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
However if you don't want it

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Then choose something else

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
And then also the other thing comes too

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
It's nice that they want to do this

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
But is this actual model built into

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Xbox Live, Marketplace

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Or Playstation Network

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Now we know Playstation Network can do it

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Because they obviously have their core subscription model

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And you can pay for stuff that way

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Why not? There's two MMOs on Xbox 360

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
That have subscription models

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Fantasy Star Universe and Final Fantasy XI

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Yeah but those are done through their own individual servers

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
But you still pay for it on Xbox Live

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
That's true, in the case of the

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Fantasy Star Universe you actually pay for that on

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Xbox Live, so it's got to

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Be there

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
They actually have you input all of your billing information

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Right before you can start

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
VXJ6V comes up with an interesting point in chat

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Loki you don't know what music comes out in the real world

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Either until it's about to or does

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
This is fundamentally nothing different from

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Actual music subscription services

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
But at the same time I mean to kind of

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
But at the same time though it's not necessarily

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Just

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I mean what are they going to do? You have to pay

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
To this service to get

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Access to all the download content

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Or you're just going to get access to the new stuff

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Like say if I'm on Rhapsody or

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
You know Napster or whatever

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Napster's got to have, I mean I'm just pulling

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
This number out of my butt, but Napster's got to have

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Hundreds of thousands of songs on it

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Exactly, that's a little different thing

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Guitar Hero has a bucket full

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Maybe, not a room full

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
You know what I mean? Exactly

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
That's totally different

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Unless they're going to start pumping out

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
20 tracks a week

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Or something like that, then that's different

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
But I don't think they are

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I notice a lot of people are kind of turning their noses

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Up as subscription models, but I mean

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
That's pretty much how all MMOs work

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And also the other thing you have to look at too

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Are people really going to start

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Wanting all this

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Licensed music

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Which is good, but at the same time

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
With Guitar Hero World Tour now you're going to have

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
All this independently made music

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
All the stuff through the

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Song creator or whatever

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
That you can download for free

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
So

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
What I'm thinking might work

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Is sort of, I'm going back to what I was saying before

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
About having the exclusive

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Subscription only stuff

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
If they have like

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Certain things that are available only

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Through subscription and they have their regular

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Bundle packs that everybody has access to

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
But there's only certain

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Really good stuff available

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
To people who are in the fan club

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
What about like a

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Just kind of really going off wild here

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
What about like a Guitar Hero magazine or something

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Or a tie in with a rock magazine

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Or something that would come with a CD with bonus tracks

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Because I'm thinking rock bands kind of done that

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Like the Xbox

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
What, official Xbox magazine had like three bonus

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Songs on it at once so you could only get there

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Well I think they came out for download eventually

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
But a long time later

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
And there was the deal about buying the soundtrack

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
That gave you the

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Bonus songs

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Alright well, we'll see, we'll see what happens

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I mean, new ideas, never a bad

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Thing to try new things, the worst that can happen

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Is you fall on your face and fail

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
But hopefully they'll still keep kind of both

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Options available, but we'll see what happens

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Who knows

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Well it looks like Activision's getting something right

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
In the UK and Ireland

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
They're actually stating

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
That there's going to be

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
A bundle pack called the Super Bundle

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
That is for, it's 150 pounds

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It has the

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Game, the guitar, the microphone, and the drum kit

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
But you also get a free bass guitar

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Well, I mean

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
You don't have to at least pay the 50 pounds for the guitar

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
You just have, you just get it in your Super Bundle

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
It's going to be

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
The same Red Octane

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
One

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
That's the Guitar Hero 3

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Peripheral for PS3

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
This is UK

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Only, just to reiterate

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
And they're saying that there's a release date

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Early November

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
So

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
That's pretty, pretty

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Interesting, I think

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
But it would be available

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
To any retailer

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And consumers can pre-order either online or in-store

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I want free stuff

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
It's not fair

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Yeah, but they're giving them old guitars

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
But it's free!

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Oh, okay. I give you a kick in the balls

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
It's free

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Now

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Yeah, but unlike a kick in the balls

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Which is somewhat entertaining

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Sorry, Rob

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
How would you know?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I'm a girl, they're very entertaining to watch

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
And deliver

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
You'll never be the recipient of one

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Exactly

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
But anyway

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I think that

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
It's actually, first of all

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
It's a good way to get rid of some overstock

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
If that's half the case

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
You could never have too many peripherals

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I love peripherals, I have a room in my house

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Dedicated to peripherals

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
You are also a freak in that regard

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
You know what? You've seen the vault

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
No, I mean that with love

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
But you know you are a freak in that regard

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Whereas I won't even get the fucking drum set

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
For Rock Band, because I'm like, I just don't need any more shit in my house

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
But I have a whole room

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
You know I'm actually getting

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
You have to get a vault, Rob

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
No vault, this is the vault

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
My freaking garage is now an internet

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Radio station hub

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
There is room here for a drum kit

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Do not want

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Pinball machine, yes, drum kit, no

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
You wanna buy our Black Knight?

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I'm poor

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
The Rock Band 2 drums are actually being delivered to my work

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
On Wednesday

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Your wife is gonna punch you in the face

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm getting rid of the old ones

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I'm upgrading, whatever

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
What are you gonna do with the old ones?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Give them to my sister, I think

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Anyways

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Some other interesting stuff about Guitar Hero

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
And I guess this is a little bit of trivia

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
The Metallica mix of their brand new album

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Is actually

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Better in Guitar Hero

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Than it is on the actual CD

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
In fact, the new Death Magnet album

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Has been mixed too loud

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
They say

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
And is actually sacrificing audio quality

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
In favor of a louder

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Sounding product

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Well, Guitar Hero on the other hand

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It's actually

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
A little bit more balanced

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
So you actually have a little bit more depth

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Than the audio in there

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
So a lot of people are thinking

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Hey, let's just rip the audio from Guitar Hero instead

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Okay, wouldn't this be a matter of opinion though?

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
No, they actually

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
They looked at the audio

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
They actually ran it through

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
You know, a

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Waveform editor or whatever

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
And it showed, you know, how they had it

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Capped in there for the CD audio

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Versus Guitar Hero

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Which is significantly better on

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Guitar Hero

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Is this one of those things that only like

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Crazy audio files would really notice?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Like, what about

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Joe Average Headbanger?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
You know, they get some Metallica CDs

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
They may not care, but you know

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I actually did listen to some of the portions of it

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
When they were comparing it

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It does sound distorted

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Sounds like someone just recorded it too loud

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
But it's Metallica! It's supposed to be loud!

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
You know what I mean?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
It's supposed to be loud, but you're supposed to turn up

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Your radio to 11!

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Okay, you're not supposed to record it loud

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And then turn it up, because it'll sound all fucked up

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
They should know this! I mean, hell

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I mean, come on! Hitstun agrees, Hitstun says

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
The CD has mad clipping, and Alpha

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Kananagram agrees it's too much clicking

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
In our chatroom, chat.com

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I think they should replace everyone's CDs

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
That's my opinion

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
It's that bad? Really?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Well, I guess so

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Especially when the CD

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
In some regard, the old-fashioned CD market

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Is struggling to survive in a way

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
This is a pretty big screw-up

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
This is what you get for buying CDs

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I'm just telling you

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
See, this is what Metallica thinks of you

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
They're all, fuck you guys, we're gonna just record it all fucked up

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Ah, you bought the CD

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Now you're stuck, bitches

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Somehow I doubt that

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
You should play Rock Band or Guitar Hero

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Alright, well look, if you want to play more

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Guitar Hero, especially Guitar Hero World Tour

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
You can use your

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Rock Band drums with Guitar Hero World Tour

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
And this story's kind of making the rounds of the

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Blogs, although I don't know, I thought I already

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Kinda knew some of this, but whatever

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Here's the thing, what happens

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
If you use a Rock Band

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Drum set in Guitar Hero

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
World Tour, and this is kind of

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Demonstrated a World Tour preview event that happened

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Earlier this week

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Basically what'll happen is that the pad

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
That's all the way on the right

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
On the five

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Note chart

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Will actually kind of go over

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
To the other orange pad instead

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
But sometimes there will be some other

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Logic as well, like if there's

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Already an orange note in there, it might actually

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Move it to a blue note

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
So there is, it's not just necessarily

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Eliminating the fifth one altogether

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Like, and I think that's kind of where this is

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Kind of resurfacing in news reports

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Cause I think the early things we thought

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Is that that fifth one would just get eliminated altogether

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
But no, those notes are gonna get moved

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Basically to other drops

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Which is kind of neat in a way

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Which is also good for score comparison and everything

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Does it truly keep everything on the same page

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Or what, is this gonna be an advantage?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Using one controller over the other

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Because one's four and one's five

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I don't think it matters

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
But then again I'm not super duper into drums as well

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Right? Yeah

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
So

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
So I got sent a link to a YouTube

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That's supposed to compare the two Metallica tracks

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
You wanna hear it a little bit?

36:30.000 --> 36:58.000
I've already listened to it

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Okay

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Okay

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Here's the thing

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I bet you, this is a radio show

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
You didn't get to see what we saw on our screen

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Which would show you which clips were guitar hero

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
And which clips were the CD

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I bet you people at home couldn't tell the difference

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Now granted this show is delivered at a lower bit rate

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But I think this is one of those things

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And you can see it in the visuals

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Absolutely, you can see, look at the waveforms

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
They absolutely look different

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Where the guitar hero wants to prep

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
But what's the audio quality on

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
YouTube?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Not that great

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
So I think you're not gonna be able to tell

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Until you actually have the two side by side

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
In person

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It's like, okay, here's an example

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
When Symphony of the Night came out on Saturn

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Dan and I actually did

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
A side by side comparison

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Because we had seen one done

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Online that we couldn't hear the difference in the music quality

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
But when we did it on our TV

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
We could

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Have them both running side by side

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Alright, some people in chat rooms say

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Yes, I hear the difference, it's very clear

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I don't know, sometimes I think people just want to argue

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
But alright, I'm gonna be honest

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
If I closed my eyes, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell you the difference

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
All I can tell you is the metallica

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
But I understand, I can see the difference

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Okay, I get the point

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I get what you guys are saying

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I heard the new album is mediocre anyway

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
So what do we even care about it?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
It's just like saying, you know

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Barney is not in high def quality

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You know, it's just in normal quality

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
What the fuck, you know

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It doesn't matter, it's Barney, no one gives a shit

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Hmm

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
That's my comparison there

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Alright, well look, not only

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Do we have that going on in the rock band world

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
That there is the news about

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
How you're gonna use the rock band drums on Guitar Hero World Tour

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
But, hey look, this is a much more

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Important clip, because

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Hey, coming to the rock band download store this week

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Finally

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
After a very, very, very

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Very long wait

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
The real Tom Sawyer

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Hell yeah

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
The actual version of Tom Sawyer

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
One of my favorite songs

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Kicking off the Moving Pictures album

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Is finally making its way to a rock band this week

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
They swear, and of course, you know

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Other songs like YYZ, Limelight

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
You know, those are all from Moving Pictures

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Not a lot

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Of songs on that album, considering

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
It was kind of epic, and the albums were

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Only like 7 or 8 tracks back then

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And that The Camera Eye is an 11

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Freaking minute song

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Epic release is very epic

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
And, as if this wasn't enough

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
You kind of get the feeling that this

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Late delivery of this album was just added

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
On top of what was already going to be released

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Because you got 6 other just kind of like

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Kind of potpourri songs

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Just kind of a hodgepodge mix

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Of songs from Bad Religion, The Cult

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Hot Hot Heat, Caspian

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Caspian, Sleater Kenny

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
And Stone Roses all have songs

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Coming out this week, so

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Very cool

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Very cool

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I may not get the whole album

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
But I do love me some Tom Sawyer, that was like one of my favorite

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Songs in the first rock band, and I think the real

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Version is much better than the cover version

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I want to get that at least

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Maybe YYZ or

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Limelight, I don't know yet

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
11 minute song, do not want

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Because that will show up in my random playlist

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Guaranteed

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
So I don't want to get the whole album, sorry

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Tom Sawyer

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Is a really, really freaking good

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Song, that's a great album in general

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
It is

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Canada knows how to rock, is your proof

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Alright

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
So, another

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Interesting thing about Guitar Hero

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
And this has been kind of circling around

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
A little bit

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Every instrument that G4 hinted to

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
It's not really an instrument at all

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
It's a MIDI sequencer

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
That's right

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
They're going to be adding a MIDI sequencer

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
That will allow you to

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Import creations

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Like

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
MIDI files from your PC

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Into Guitar Hero World Tour

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
As well as

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Allowing you to

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I guess

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
At least on the PS3

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
To import different tracks

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Including instruments

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Rhythm lead, guitar, bass

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Keyboards, and drum tracks

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
However on the 360 it will only be limited to drums

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Due to hardware issues

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Which, whatever

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I don't understand what hardware issues they could be having

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
That would prevent them from doing this

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
But whatever

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
So yeah

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I guess kind of interesting

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
No word on price or when it's going to be released

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
But

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
You're really hardcore into making

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I guess

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Tracks on there

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
That actually sounds kind of awesome though

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I think I'd use it

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I think it's a neat idea for an expansion

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You know the results could be iffy

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
But I think that's really taken this franchise

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
In a different direction

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I don't know how often it will actually be used though

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Tiger Clawed Chat says

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
I think you could also create techno on that

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Could you?

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Could you make different genres of music and stuff?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
You could make

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Well I was telling them about drum and bass stuff

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
They said that yeah you can make

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Whatever to your heart's content on there

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
So you could make a drum and bass

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Track or a techno track if you're that creative

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Interesting

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
That's the only thing that kind of makes me

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Want to buy maybe just the game only version

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Or something

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Just to check that out

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I don't know I'll wait and see

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
So Black Wolf and I are having a little bit of an argument

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
In chat room right now over the last story

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
And he says Rush is the only good thing

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
To come out of Canada

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
And I said wait a minute no no no no

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Degrassi

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Hello

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
You can't do that on television

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
He says I still lose

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Degrassi is not a great thing to come out of Canada

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
And I think you're full of poop sir

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
And what was that show?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Out of Control

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Out of Control

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
That show was great

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Kids in the Hall

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
And what is that dish

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
With the french fries with gravy

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Poutain or whatever

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
That stuff is good

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
That stuff rocks too

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
And maple syrup

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Alright forget it

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
We love Canada come on

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
And hockey

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Alright I think Black Wolf is just giving us a hard time

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Now he's really starting to argue with us

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Just for the sake of arguing

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Alright how about some release dates

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Do we gotta

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Okay well coming out

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000

Yay Wario Land

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Alright awesome

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
That game is gonna be great

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Forgot that that's actually coming out

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Anyways Nintendo's been doing a great job marketing that

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Oh yeah

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I mean not really

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Yeah that's gonna be a

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
As good as the DS one fortunately

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Who knows maybe there'll be an onslaught of

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Marketing Blitz in the game itself

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I hope so, the game's awesome

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
It really is better than I think a lot of people are expecting it to be

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Well

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Starting off this week in the US

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
We've got

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
The Price is Right coming to PC

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
And I think other systems as well

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Baja The Edge of Control

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Coming out on

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Wasn't that Price is Right game supposed to be out last week?

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
This is the PC version

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
They may have delayed it from last week so

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Oh

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Let's see, same with the Hell's Kitchen PC game

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
So I'm guessing it came out last week

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Kirby Superstar Ultra

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
On the DS which they actually did

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Some pretty good marketing for that

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
They had like little Kirby clouds

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Which is kinda neat

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
And I doubt this is coming out but apparently the

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Symbol pack, 2 pack

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
2 is supposed to be out

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I heard that it's supposed to be October

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
And of course you go to a GameStop and you ask them

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Hey one of the symbols coming at your website says the 22nd

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
And we're like I don't know

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
So the hell with them

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
You can get a box set of

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
The Command and Conquer games

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Coming to the Wii

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
DeBlob, also coming

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
And 5 and 6 coming to the DS

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Hey, quick question

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Does anyone give a shit about Brain Quest

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Grade 3, 4, 5, 6

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Cause I'm thinking we can make this segment

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
A little shorter

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
No we can't

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
By cutting out the games that not a single

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
OLR listener cares about, not a one

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
That is being

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Biased right there

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
It is completely biased, but also true

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Hey, we've got parents to listen, who knows

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Maybe they want to get something for their kid

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Maybe you're full of poop

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Something that says, hey look, I know you like games, but I hate you

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
You know, that kind of thing

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
And they might also get them Barbie Fashion Show

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Eye for Style for the DS

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
There you go

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Dinosaur King, coming out for the DS

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
What better way to tell your child I hate you

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Sing Star Pop Volume 2

Coming out on Playstation 2

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Onimusha, The Essentials

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
It's a 3-pack collection

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Of previous Onimusha games

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000

Coming out on Playstation 3

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Line Rider 2

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Unbound on PC

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
And DS this week, I believe

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Also Dragon Ball Z

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
trilogy coming out on Playstation 2

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
We've also got

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Time Hollow on the DS

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Which is a Konami

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Role-playing game

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Pipe Mania is a puzzle game

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Kind of like Pipe Dream

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
And also the hacking in Bioshock

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
That's on PSP

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
And I want to say the Wii also

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Lego Batman

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Pretty much on every single system out there

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Playstation 2, 3

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
360, Wii, DS, and PSP

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Lost in Blue Shipwrecked on the Wii

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
My Japanese coach

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
That moved to October

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
So that date's wrong

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Bastards have incorrect dates on their website

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Rebel Raiders

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
On the Wii

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Although that game sucks balls

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
So I wouldn't recommend buying it

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Lots of stuff this week, I guess

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Cavella's Dangerous Hunts 2009

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
on Playstation 2 and 360

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Uhhhh

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I think we're almost done here

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Thank god

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Sorry

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Hi Hamtaro Ham Ham Challenge

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Cause it's a cute hamster game on the DS

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
And

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Disgaea DS

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Disgaea DS

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
God damn there's a lot of shit this week

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Come on

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Well while you're trying to figure it out

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I looked up cause I was curious

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
What's on that Sing Star Pop Volume 2

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
And kind of an interesting

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
mix of songs

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Nelly Furtado, Permisqueous

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Jenny from the Block by Jennifer Lopez

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
This is definitely a top 40 mix here

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Fergie, Big Girls Don't Cry

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
The Sweet Escape, Gwen Stefani

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And uh

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I don't know Dark Soccer maybe you'll like this one

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Rihanna, Umbrella, Ella

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Ella, A

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I actually don't like that song

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
I like the remix

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Under My Umbrella, Ella, Ella, A

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I only like the remix

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Alright alright enough of that

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
That's annoying seriously

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Rhapsody a Musical Adventure on the DS

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Rob

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
What?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Knock it out

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Can I turn off her mic? How do I unplug her mic?

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I don't know

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Pitfall, The Big Adventure on the Wii

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And that's it

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Done

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Finally, alright no I'm just kidding

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Alright let's look at Japan release dates and see what's coming out over in Japan this week

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
On the 25th

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Of Infinite Undiscovery and the English language version

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Make their way to regions outside Japan

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Sometimes I get some general

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Asia release dates

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Like I said this Friday for regions outside Japan

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
But in Japan you get a game called

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Janline comes out in Japan this Friday

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Also Madden NFL 09

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
And Tiger Woods PGA Tour on 09

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Finally come out in Japan this Friday

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Because they usually get localized versions of our sports games

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Just a little later than we do

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Also coming out on the

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
PlayStation 3

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Aquanauts Holiday comes out in Japan

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
From Sony Entertainment

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Also a new headset will come out

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Madden NFL 09

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Quest for Booty comes out

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Again that's an Asia release not just Japan

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
But just Japan would be

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Going to some of the other systems

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Taking a look at the

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Nintendo Wii

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Bomberman comes out on

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
September 25th as does

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Disaster Day of Crisis

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
SimCity Creator

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
The simple 2000 series for the Wii

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
The Table Game volume 1

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
So Loki you like the simple series on the

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Game Boy Advance right?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
So now they have these games coming out on the Wii

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I used to check out some of the stuff on the PlayStation 2

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
The Wii stuff

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I've gotten like a couple

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
But I haven't actually played them

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
They have all the kind of weird stuff

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I don't play my Zhong

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
So a lot of that doesn't apply to me

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
An interesting looking game called

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Soul Eater Monotone Princess

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Also comes out from Squeenix on the Wii

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
So that's a Square Enix game

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
And it looks a little bit like

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Action kind of mixed with the whole

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Anime type of cutscenes

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Going on so

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Looks like it could be interesting if you're a fan of those types of games

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
That's it for the Nintendo Wii this week

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Let's take a look at the

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
PlayStation 2 since they're still cranking stuff out for that

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
And I do want to point out

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Secret of Evangelion is going to be

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
A best hit now in Japan

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
As of September 25th

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
So will Angel Profile that will also be

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Getting a price reduction

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
But if you're looking for some new stuff

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Anyway there's quite a bit

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
There's Super Robot Taisen Z comes out

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
As well as Sugar Plus Spice

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Anoko no Suteken no Name no Kamo

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Comes out as well

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
And let's see

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Soul Cradle

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Well that's another best hit

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
How about this one though

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Nojizaka

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Tsunku no Himitsu

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Cosplay

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Hajime Mashita

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
That is the game coming out

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
And all I have to say is that

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
It's got a girl dressed as a maid

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
On the cover of it

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
And some of the screenshots from the game

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Some of the screenshots from the game

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Topless Bathing Sun Beauties

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Actually inside the game

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
And Women in Nurse Outfits

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Sweet

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Oh the name of it right there

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Jamie's looking at the name there

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
To see if she can figure out

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I see Secret Cosplay

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Secret Cosplay

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Looks like a lot of fanboy fantasies might come true

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
With that game so you might want to check that out

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I think it's a fetish game

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Nice

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
It's Secret Cosplay

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Coming out in Japan on the Nintendo DS

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Gobble Gobble Planet

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Knights in the Nightmare

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Princess Maker 4

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Special Edition

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
And a game you might know from here in the US

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Guitar Hero on Tour makes his way to Japan

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
On the Nintendo DS this week

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Also lastly

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
On the Sony PSP

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Taking a look to see if anything

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Is coming out next week

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Patapon gets a price reduction

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Because that game has been very popular

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Princess Maker 5 portable

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
It is a Princess Maker week

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
This week you got new ones on the

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
PSP and a price reduction on the DS

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
What a week

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
There you have it your Japanese release dates

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Alright let's get back

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Into some news

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
After the release dates

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Well in other news

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Sorry

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
And this is actually very happy for me

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Because I love

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Freaking Metal Slug

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Don't we all know this already right?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I heard a rumor

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Well

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
It looks like

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
SNK is going to be

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Doing

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
A high def

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Version sort of like

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
How some of the other old school games

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Have gone

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
So that might be cool

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I just want it to still play

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Like Metal Slug

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I don't want it to be 3D

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
I want it to be 2D

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
With very high res pretty

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Pretty pretties

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Well I think that's probably what they're going to do

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Because they did the same thing with King of Fighters 12

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Yeah

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
But I think

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
A lot of times

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
This has happened with a lot of different franchises

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Originally

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
2D that they've put to 3D

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Is that if they

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Try to like

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Okay remember the Street Fighter EX series

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Now I liked the later EX games

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
But they still weren't right

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Or

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Fogger going 3D

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Yeah something was always weird about that

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Yeah so I think that they would be in their best interest

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
To keep the 2D

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Or to go the

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
You know what I mean by the 2.5D

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
They're doing

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
You know where it's 3D but plays 2D

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I'm all for the 2.5D

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Like what was it

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Fantasy Zone

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
The Sega Ages one that I have

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It still played

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Just like the 2D one

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
It was all cel shaded

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
You couldn't really tell it was 3D

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Except it would do rotations in some places

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
It gave it a little bit more depth to it

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I think that they should do something

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Like that

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
In the high res route

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Well we'll see if we get more information on this soon

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Let's see

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Well in other news

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
And this is actually pretty cool

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Nintendo may actually have a chance to redeem itself

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
They're actually holding a media summit

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
In early October

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Supposedly on the 2nd and 3rd

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
This has already been confirmed for Japan

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
But what they're going to talk about

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Who knows

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
But the event also

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
There's supposed to be a US event as well

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Taking place in San Francisco around the same time

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Guesses of course

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Would be the announcement of Disaster Day of Crisis

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Since it's already been announced

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
For the Japanese market

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Obviously since it's coming out next week

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
And for Europe

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Because it's coming out in October

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
But no word on

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
A US release yet

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
And

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Other rumors or thoughts maybe

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
That they're going to announce that

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Conduit's being published by them now

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Maybe some new games or something like that

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
But we'll have to see

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Maybe a storage solution

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Who knows

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I would like to hear that

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
That would be a wonderful announcement

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
We'll see

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Well you know it's almost kind of like

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
It was a fanboy story almost going around a while back

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
That Microsoft

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
You've probably heard this before

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Nintendo

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
What if oh yeah Microsoft's going to buy Nintendo

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Especially kind of back before the Wii was announced

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Used to hear these kind of rumors

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Remember hearing this like oh yeah

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Microsoft's going to buy Nintendo and they're going to conquer the world

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Well what's kind of interesting

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
There actually

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Was kind of a little bit of truth to that

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
And that was explained by Peter Moore

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Who was talking in an interview this week

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
He actually mentioned during the interview

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Balmer wanted to know

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
And that was an individual that he worked with at Microsoft

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Wanted to know how he was going to win

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
For Microsoft

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
How we were going to take on Sony

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
How we would compete with or acquire Nintendo

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Those were the conversations in those days

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It was a classic build or buy conversation

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Interestingly we were just completely fixated on Sony

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Nintendo didn't even come into the conversation

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Notice that way he said that though

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Compete with or acquire

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Nintendo

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
But now after the massive success of the Wii

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
The world may never know what would have happened

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
If Microsoft and Nintendo had merged

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Very interesting huh

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
But it might also kind of give some background as to why

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Microsoft is a little more willing to put some of their

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Stuff out on DS like Viva Pinata

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Kind of has that DS game

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
And they're not really competing with Nintendo on that market

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
They really have their heart set on Sony

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Black Wolf chimes in and says

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Nintendo laughed at Microsoft

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
They actually did have a meeting

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
And you know when you've got a very

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Very American company and a very

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Very Japanese company in that regard

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
It kind of doesn't surprise me

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
You know what I mean

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
So I think sometimes our perspective

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Might be a little skewed being over here

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
What's just a ginormous company

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And what power Nintendo has

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
But it's interesting that in some

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Regards in that way they've kind of worked together

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
A bit

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Well

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Other neat things

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Nintendo of course they only

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Teased us very briefly

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
During the E3 media

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Event

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars now

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
There's a little bit more details coming out from

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Nintendo Power

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
And the game itself is actually

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Going to be a cel-shaded

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Isometric game

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
It is still going to be M-rated

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Of course it's still going to be a crime drama

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
They actually had some screenshots to look

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
It sort of resembles I guess

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
A little bit like the

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Old Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Just kind of shot a little different

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Kind of

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Grand Theft Auto cell phone games that they had

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
But it looks neat

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
It'll be interesting to check out

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
They said that the

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
So as a Grand Theft Auto fan

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
You're interested

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I'm interested to check it out

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Some of the artwork looks kind of weird

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But it'll be interesting to see how the game plays

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Be definitely willing to

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Check it out because it's Grand Theft Auto

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And I love Grand Theft Auto

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
They were saying though that

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
It's going to be a sizable

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Or the game's going to take place in a sizable

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Portion of Liberty City

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
The map has

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Been altered from of course the console version

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Which only makes sense

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And the missions will also be shorter and can

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Easily be restarted upon failure

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
The D-pad is going to be used for aiming

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
While the R button activates in

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Auto-targeting

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And there's going to be a subtle

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Auto-steering built into

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
The driving controls as well so you can

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Shoe out the window and stuff like that

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
But they're going to bring back the over the top weapons

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Like the minigun, the flamethrowers

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And pretty much a lot of the stuff that was in

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Like say

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
So it'll be pretty cool

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And it's still due out this winter

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Which I think January is the month

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Very interesting

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I want to backtrack just a little bit going to the last story

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Because sometimes our chat room is a little behind

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Because of the delay from when we say something to when it goes out over the radio

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
But kind of a comment on

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
The whole Microsoft Nintendo thing and how

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Microsoft kind of plays nicely with the DS

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Tigerclaw gives an interesting comment in our chat room

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
chat.orangelsonshooter.com

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Microsoft is sort of getting into the handheld

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Gaming market with the release of the second gen

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Zune which will play

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Games so that's true this new

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Zune thing they got does the games

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
But at the same time I kind of when I first read that

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I saw it more of a response to the iPhone

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I'm not so much

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
The DS but I mean it's an interesting

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Point though it's not that like

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Microsoft doesn't do handheld games of any sort

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
But I sort of see it more as like an iPhone

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Type of game in my opinion

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I have a feeling that

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
If they were to get into the handheld market

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
It wouldn't be with the Zune

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And if they did I don't think they'd have trouble

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Passing up the PSP

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
The DS on the other hand

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
The DS on the other hand though I don't think

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
They'll be

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Well one game that probably won't find its way

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
To the Zune unless they find some way to

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Have a spin off would be Halo

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Halo 3 specifically and Halo 3

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Is going to be getting a new title update

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And guess when it's coming?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Tuesday September the 23rd so maybe by the time

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
A lot of you guys hear this

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Halo 3 update will be there it's going to be an automatic download

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
You may have to kind of clear out the cash

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
First though before the download will actually

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Happen there but once you get the new updates

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
There's going to be a brand new ranking system

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Some changes to the playlist

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Some brand new achievements which will be cool

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
A complete overhaul to Bungie.net

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Which is pretty cool and the Bungie.net

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Website is slowly changing throughout the next week

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
So pretty cool there

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And I know some of you achievement whores are very excited

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
About new achievements so you'll be able to check that out

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
This Tuesday with the free update

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
To Halo 3

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So there you go

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Well in

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Other MMO news

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
There actually have been some more details put out

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
About Star Trek Online

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I know that a few of us have been looking forward to this

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
They actually said

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
On the website that there are going

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
To be more

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Details coming out soon but for right now

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
The ships are going to be something

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Like naval combat

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Using traditional MMO game

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Gameplay

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Klingon ships are going to be

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Different

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
A bit more reflecting of

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Their culture

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Everything will be very customizable

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
You can modify and customize

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The uniforms of the characters but they still have to look like

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
A uniform

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
So the options are going to

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Be things from the show and bring in some new things

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
So it's supposed to be cool

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And is it supposed to be out in the next three years?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
That's

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
A long wait

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
That sometimes means more towards

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
The end of that three years so like

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
2011 that's going to be a long wait

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Whew

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I hope it's worth it

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Definitely

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Well other

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Fun PC games of course

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Spore

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
One of the biggest complaints about Spore

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Of course is some of the DRM restrictions

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Well EA has heard your pleas

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And they have decided to loosen them up

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
A bit so now

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Some of the changes that they've had

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And of course without

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
You know of course they were

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Bitching and moaning about having to do it

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
But they did it anyways

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
They expanded the number of eligible

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Machines that you can install the product on

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
From three to five

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
They will offer ways for you to

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Request additional activations

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Where warranted

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And also developing a system that

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Will allow the consumer to deauthorize machines

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And move authorizations to new machines

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And on top of that

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
As well they're going to allow you to

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Log in multiple characters

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Into each account

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
So you're going to be able to have I think up to

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Five different

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Players

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
On each

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Of your activations

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So that's kind of cool

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I wish they would get rid of secure ROM though

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That's the part that's kind of weird

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
But you know at least they're trying to meet you halfway on this stuff

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I think that's the one component that really still needs to happen

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Is that whole secure ROM thing

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
But at the same time it's kind of like you know

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
If you think there's going to be no DRM in these games

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Whatsoever, dream on

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I mean that's just the way it's going to be

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
This is the day and age we live in

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
This is what they're going to try to do to protect their games

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Although it still does kind of suck that you know

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Days before the release and the legitimate users

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Have to suffer

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It's just like having a car alarm in your car

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I mean it's not going to prevent people from

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Stealing stuff out of your car

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It just makes it more difficult

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And it's just like you know the secure ROM stuff

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And the DRM stuff, it's just going to make people

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Have to try that much harder to

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Crack it to be able to steal your product

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And make it as hard for them as possible

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Although it's not very hard

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And it's not

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Too much of an inconvenience

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It's not at all an issue

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
It's not as easy as say you know

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Bob down the street gets a game

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And there's no DRM and just copies it

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
For all of his friends

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Well one game that's very hard to copy

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Because you have to have your own individual

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Account to play online

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
These are the games that are hard to copy

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
MMOs

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Unless you have the whole private server and that whole stuff

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
But hey, World of Warcraft obviously

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Doesn't have too big a problem with piracy

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Because they've got what like 7 million people playing the game

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And they are all looking forward to the brand new expansion

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Wrath of the Lich King

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Which finally got dated this week

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
November 13th, 2008

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
If you have some war crack addicted friends

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Expect them to call in sick on this day

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Because they probably will be

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Working on heading up to Northrend

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And some of the new areas up there like the Howling Fjord

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And trying to level the characters to 80

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Maybe playing some Lake Wintergrasp

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Running some of the new instances

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Leveling Inscription

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Or their new Death Knight

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Millions of different things to do in the new Warcraft expansion

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I'm looking forward to the dance studio

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Myself

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
You can teach characters new dances now apparently

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Which is badly needed

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And also you can get your characters some haircuts

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So very interesting

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
How you can almost

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Micro manage

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Even more

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
That's the last thing our MMO needed

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
More micromanaging

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Well there's a new add on coming to

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
World of Warcraft

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And it's Bejeweled

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Oddly enough this game started off

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
As a third party knock off

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Bejeweled

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It was called Becharted

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And the developer from Willer

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Actually

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Kind of made it as a method

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Of killing time during long raids

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And farming sessions

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
But apparently

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
PopCap caught wind of it

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And instead of having them

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Stop making it

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
They actually

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Wanted him to

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Or they hired him on to create a more polished

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Version of the application

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
That will be released for the game

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So you'll be able to play

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Bejeweled

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
And my wife was excited to hear this

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
So now if your wife gets sucked into

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Getting World of Warcraft

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Yeah she's just going to be playing Bejeweled

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And they're just sitting there playing Bejeweled

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I know

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
World of Warcraft is the best game ever

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Cause it has

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Bejeweled in it

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
So no you were telling this on Bobby's show

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I don't think you told it on our show though

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
The wife is actually signing up for a Warcraft account

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Thanks to Extifer

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
She's trying the 14 day trial

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
She may actually do

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
A month in 14 days because

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Extifer wants to get I guess you get some

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Recruitment bonuses or something like that

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Kind of like the military or something where you get

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Like a special mounts

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Or triple experience or some shit

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I don't know it's retarded but

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So she may

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Indulge him in that but

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Yeah she's going to try it

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I have to install it on this laptop that I'm using

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Right now cause

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You're that I buy her a new laptop

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
She wants me to buy her a Mac and I'm like

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Fuck that shit

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Oh my god

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I think now the wife is purposely trying to get into

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Things that you don't like just to

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Piss you off I don't know

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I don't think she

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
The thing is you have to know her

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
She doesn't have the patience for it

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And she's going to quit like very fast

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I will be very surprised

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
If she actually

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
We should take bets on what level

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Nellie will quit at

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
How far she gets her character up before she quits

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I'm down with that

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
What would the bet be?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I don't know

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Like what does the loser have to do

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Or what does the loser get

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Or win or get

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I don't know I don't even care

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
DarkSakura can you think of anything

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
That's not too extreme like no tingle dressing up

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
For a bet like this

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
We have to poop? Well I think everybody does that

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
On a semi regular basis if you're not

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
You might want to see a doctor

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Alright

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
We'll figure something out maybe make a bet

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
In part B

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I just don't think she'll have the time for this game

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Seriously I think she'll probably

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Level to about 5 and then stop

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
We'll see

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
We'll see

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Alright anyhow hey

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Maybe there's some other games that Loki's wife

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Should be checking out because there's a classic

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Gaming archive that dates

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Years and years and years that have

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of games

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
In it and every week

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Here on this program DarkSakura selects

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
One of them to highlight here

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
On this program and we call it the classic

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Video game of the week

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
So what should the

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Kids be playing this week DarkSakura?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
For lack of a better

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Game I picked Snake Rattle and Roll

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Because I know it's a

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
A game that somebody I

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Think is great really likes

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
So um

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Oh me? No

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I really like it

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
No I put it on there for

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Sauce although I think it's been a while since

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
She's played it but it was a game that was

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Made by Rare

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And it came out on the NES

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
In 1990 it's one of the

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Earliest platform games

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
It was a 3D isometric playing field sort of like

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
How Marble Madness was

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
They uh

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Actually it didn't really sell all that

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Great but it was actually kind of a fun little game

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It was really difficult too

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
But the whole point is that you are two snakes called

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Rattle and Roll and you have to eat these little things

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Called Nibley Pibleys and race to the moon

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
So

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
That's what you play. There was supposed to be a sequel

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Called Snakes to Snakes but

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
It was never made but there was Sneaky Snakes

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
For Game Boy in 1991

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And it had a version come out on

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Sega on the uh

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Mega Drive in 1993

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
So that's pretty cool

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I never knew there was a Mega Drive version of this

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
It's kind of neat

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Huh. Well I like this game quite a bit

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
It's actually a lot of fun. I'm kind of sad we never got that sequel

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
And this is a Rare game

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
So yet again here's another great

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Franchise that Rare could go back and revisit

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Someday on I don't know Xbox Live

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Arcade but I somehow think they never will

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Which is sad

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It makes me cry

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Alright

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Well it looks like that's it. That's your classic game of the week folks

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Snake, Rattle and Roll

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
For the Nintendo Entertainment System

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
But also on the Mega Drive apparently

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Which I just learned tonight

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Alright on that note

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
We're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And yes we're going to talk about Mega Man 9

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
We'll also talk about a new sweet code and game

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And we'll talk about Project Gotham Racing 5

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
It's all coming up in part B

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
So hey don't go anywhere we'll be right back

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Having a bad day

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Job getting you down

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Are you looking for something to pick you up

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Give you a laugh all at the same time

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Then oh brother do I have the show for you

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000

Ladies and gentlemen

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Rape isn't funny

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Unless if it's clown rape

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Rape of people is not funny

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Rape of monsters is funny

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Because monsters are bad

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And when bad people

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
What I'm just not going to keep going

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I'm digging myself a hole

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I'm Brad

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Like comics and video games

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Along with the occasional special musical guest

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
There's something for the geek in us all

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And head on over to our little corner of the verse

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
www.podculture.net

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Pod Culture

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Equal Opportunity Geek Month

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:58.000
See you soon

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Welcome back

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Kids to Orange Lounge Radio

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Here on this lovely Sunday evening

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
September the 21st, 2008

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Five weeks to go until episode 300

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
If you can believe it

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Yes, we've been on the air that long

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
To have done 300 weekly episodes

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
You know, and obviously we've missed a week here and there

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
So, you know, it's taken us a little over six years to get here

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
But quite an accomplishment

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I don't know many other shows, if any, that have gotten to the 300 weekly show mark

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So, yeah, now we're trying to decide what exactly we're going to do to celebrate

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
We're going to try to get some big guests on the show that week

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I know that I'm going to try to start sending some emails this week

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And just have a potpourri of big names on the show that week

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
But otherwise I'm not sure what other surprises we have in store

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
But if you have suggestions please email us

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Or email me directly

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
You can get all our contact information on the website

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Anyhow, we've got lots more gaming news to discuss

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And only a little bit of time to do it

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
So let's get back to it

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
During the break we heard some music from the new Mega Man 9

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Unfortunately folks on the podcast don't get to hear that

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Because, you know, the whole copyright and all that stuff we can't offer it up for download

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
But the live listeners did hear it

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And I believe Loki's going to start us off with some Mega Man 9 news tonight

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Yes, in fact, if you liked Mega Man 9's music

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
You're going to like it even more when you can actually buy the game

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Which comes out on the 22nd

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Or tomorrow if you're listening to us live

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
On the WiiWare download service

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
If you do not own a Wii and you own a PS3

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
You'll be able to purchase it on the Playstation Network on the 25th

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And if you want it on the 360

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Well you're going to have to wait until October 1st

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
But it will be available soon

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And that's awesome

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Another thing that will be available shortly after all that comes out

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Is some download content for Mega Man 9

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And the first new playable character they're going to include

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Is Protoman

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And you're going to actually be able to use him

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Some of the stuff that you get like the rush adapters

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Actually change to proto adapters in the game

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And including like the proto sled, proto coil, etc

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I guess it's all just kind of

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I'm sorry, it's just crazy that there's download content

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
For like an old school Nintendo game in a way

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
It's just kind of cool, I don't know why

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
It's just really really cool

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Yes, so that will be available on October 6th

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
For $2 or the equivalent thereof

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And by the way, even though we can't play the entire Mega Man 9 soundtrack

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Or so on the live show

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
We can play a little clip

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
So here's what some of the music sounds like

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Here's a clip from Tornado Man's stage

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
So you can see it has all that same retro goodness

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Of the old school Mega Man games

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Like you knew it was going to have

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And some other cool stuff

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
If you happen to be all nostalgic

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And love playing Mega Man 9

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Well, I don't know if you remember that fake

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Well I guess old school box art they had

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Going out for Mega Man 9

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
The really human face for Mega Man

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
That was scary, yeah

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
You now can actually purchase the fake box

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
A fake NES cart

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And I guess it may come with the asset CD

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
That they were handing out before

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Because these were for press release stuff

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
They had screenshots and all sorts of stuff

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
But they are available on the Capcom store

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
So you can find those at capcom-unity.com

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
And they will be exceedingly rare

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
So if you're interested in getting it

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
You might want to put an order in as soon as possible

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
It's kind of neat

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yeah, how much do you think those things will start going for on eBay?

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Who knows? Quite a bit I'd imagine

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Anyone in here planning to get that game this week?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Yes

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I think we're going to

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Jamie of course having a little trouble with her voice tonight

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Because of the allergies

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
But I think she just said she

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
They think they're going to get it this week

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I want to because I think the d-pad on the Wii is pretty awesome

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Whereas the d-pad on the 360 not so awesome

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
However, I love achievement points

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
So therefore I will be getting out of that too

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Yeah, I think I'm going to be holding off on the 360 version

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Even though the controller bugs the crap out of me

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I'm kind of hoping that's one of the things Microsoft is going to fix in 09

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Based on what we saw at the Leipzig show

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
At least I'm hoping

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
We'll see

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Anyhow, other games and other big franchises that people are really excited about

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Suikoden!

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I know we got a few Suikoden fans in the house

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
A brand new Suikoden game was announced for DS

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
It's not a numbered Suikoden game

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
But a new game called Suikoden Tier Crease is the new game that's coming out

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And this is kind of neat

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
What's kind of cool about this game

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Again, the big niche of the Suikoden series

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
You could say is that it's a classic JRPG

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
But you have 108 characters in it

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
There's just tons and tons and tons of characters

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
What's kind of cool about this one is that

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
With the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection now

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
You can actually play where you're leveling one of the 108 people

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
But somebody else can level the other characters

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And you can all participate in leveling up the different characters

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
So it provides a new way to level up characters

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And creates a little bit of a community

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And apparently when they say Nintendo Wi-Fi connection

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
They are talking the internet

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Not just a local Wi-Fi connection

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
So that could be very interesting

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I'm kind of curious to see how this plays out

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
So more information to come on that

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Apparently this was shown at a Konami event

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
That we weren't invited to this year

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Sad

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
But I heard it was in New York

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
That's probably why

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Yeah

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
It wasn't on our coast

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
I'm sure it was

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Oh well

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
They couldn't fly us out there

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Even though they flew everybody else out there

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Oh well

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Not that we're going to be bitter much

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
But we can't really tell you much more about the game

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Because we didn't see it

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Oh darn

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I couldn't play Rock Revolution

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Maybe have a positive

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Do you think maybe that's why you didn't get invited?

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Well

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
No I don't think so

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
But hey

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
You know what

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
If the game stinks we're not going to hold back at the same time

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
It's more important we have integrity

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Than you know

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I could have

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
But see that's the thing

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I'm only taking it based off of

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
You know screenshots and stuff

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
That's not very accurate

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
And with you know

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Out playing it

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I can't really give you my true impression

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
But whatever

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Who cares

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
It's not important

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So anyway

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Sweet Coding looks interesting though

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I you know

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I've missed out on some of the more recent Sweet Coding games

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
But I did enjoy the ones on Playstation 1

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
So I might have a reason to check it out

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I think the online component sounds neat

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So Peter Molyneux

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
He actually of course

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Has this little game coming out called Fable 2

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And you may remember

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
There were some games released on Xbox Live Arcade

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Called the Fable 2 Pub Games

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Where you can earn gold to use in the actual game

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Well of course people found you know

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Exploits and glitches

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
To be able to make a lot of money really quick

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
And according to Peter Molyneux

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
That was intentional

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And that they're going to be in for a surprise

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
When they actually start the game

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And of course now there's

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
You know a patch being put out that fixes that

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And all that stuff

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Somehow I think he's full of shit

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
To be honest

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And I don't think it was intentional

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And I think maybe if you try it with this new patch

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
It will do trigger something

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
But I think

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
If you're doing it and besides you can also

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
You know clear out your hard drive cache or whatever

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And erase these updates and cheat anyways

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I don't think it's going to matter

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I'm kind of curious to see what happens

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I do claim bullshit on the fact that it was premeditated

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
But I think there is some legitimacy

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
To the fact that something will happen in the game

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
If you cheat it I think they will be able to

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Enable that

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Because sometimes even if you buy it

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Like even if the game had already like pretty much gone gold

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Or whatever and there wasn't time to add in

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Something to you know get the cheaters

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
They could patch it in

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
When the release happens

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Because how many times have you bought a new Xbox game

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And it patches day one

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Well I know that

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I'm not saying something about the game

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I'm saying that the Xbox Live Arcade game

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Is going to have to be patched

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
In order for it to be able to detect the cheating

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Because I think that you're going to try it

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And you know if you try the same technique

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
To cheat now

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Now that they have it patched in

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
That it's going to raise a flag or something

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
That's going to cause it to you know trigger in the game

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
If you're that worried about it

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Just flush your you know

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Your Fable 2 pub games file

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And flush your hard drive

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Exactly just do it offline or whatever

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And the patch is actually already live according to Zushi

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yes it is already live

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And so I haven't actually played the pub games yet

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Even though I got them

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Yeah I played them for like five minutes

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
And honestly they're I mean especially like

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
One of them is just basically a fancy slot machine

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Which brings nothing new to the table

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
The other one is kind of like a weird version of roulette

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
The pyramid game was interesting

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
But it didn't hold my attention for long enough

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Honestly

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I think a lot of people were just getting it to exploit the hell out of it

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
For when the game actually comes out

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
But I don't know what do you guys think in chat

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Do you think it was intentional the whole time

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
That they intended to have an exploit in there

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I mean it does definitely kind of tie into the whole good versus evil thing

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Yeah but it also makes it sound like he's

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
He likes to sound like a smarty pants

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
And just you know trying to

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Oh I did all this stuff

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Because I think outside the box

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I think greater than all this

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I don't think he thought anything

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I think it's just a glitch

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That now they're patching in some sort of

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Reprecussion if you try it

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
So whatever

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Big freaking whoop

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Well who knows if we'll get a new Fable game next year

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
But one game we'll probably get next year

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Is a brand new James Bond game

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Right Activision has said that they are planning to put out

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Yearly Bond games

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Even though the movies only seem to come out every other year

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
They're going to actually be trying to crank out

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Yearly Bond titles

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Of course right now the game they're trying to put out is Quantum of Solus

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
It's actually based on the Call of Duty 4 engine

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And you know obviously the movie tie in

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
They've got this year

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
But they may do these games even if there is no movie

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
To go off of

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
They haven't mentioned what the genre will be

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
They haven't mentioned who's going to develop them

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
What systems are going to be made for

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
They're going to be aggressive in milking this James Bond franchise

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
For all it's worth

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
And frankly I don't really blame them

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
People everywhere love their James Bond

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
It's not surprising at all

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
They're going to try to milk this franchise

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
And let's face it you know one of the greatest video games

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
On the Nintendo 64 ever

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Was the James Bond game

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
GoldenEye

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
That game made me so sick

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
But you know sometimes

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I know there was a James Bond game I played

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
That wasn't necessarily based off a movie

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
But there have been a few

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Not that they've been wonderful

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
But who knows we'll see what happens

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Anyway just really quickly I wanted to go over some of the responses

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Was the pub games intentional or not?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
James Patrick says

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Peter M. isn't a typical guy

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I think it could very well be intentional

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Game Guru says

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
They should keep the cheat in

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
But have it make you more evil

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
So that yeah you can cheat but it's an evil act

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Oh interesting

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
So we'll see what happens

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
So

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
If you want to comment on our stories

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
We want comments

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Well this actually is good news for our European listeners

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Or anybody listening or not

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
But we hope you're listening

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Actually the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
On the 19th of September

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
The 360 arcade

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Is going to

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
129 pounds

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Excuse me

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
The 60 gigabyte pro

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Is going to 169

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And the 120 gigabyte elite

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Is 229 pounds

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
So good news

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Yay cheaper things

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And I'm glad you know because Europe

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Sometimes gets the shaft in a lot of our news stories

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So it's nice to hear them getting a break once in a while

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
It's just too bad they didn't get it the same time

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
We did but hey better late than never

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Right?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
There's a big old rumor coming out about

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Project Gotham 5 saying now that

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
It's being developed by the Forza

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Development team

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And that there could be an announcement for it

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Next week

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
According to a website called Addict

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Gaming

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
They have a reliable source

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
That the game

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Will be unveiled next week

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And also mentions

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
That this may be

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
This is supposed to take place during the new

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Xbox experience announcement

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Scheduled for next week which a lot of people have already

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Debunked as being false

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
There could be this like 5 hour long

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Thing on G4

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I mean granted I can see how they could do that

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Since there's nothing really plain on G4 except

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Reruns of cops and cheaters

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Haven't we already had a rumor about a G4 marathon

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Of something that got debunked?

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
This is the same thing but this is saying that

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
This is going to be part of that announcement

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
So it could all be bullshit or you know

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Heaven forbid

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Microsoft and G4 could have been

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Lying to us and it's actually going to happen

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I mean but you know

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Once again we'll see you next week

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
You know what don't you think

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I don't know if I were G4 television and I had a big

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Exclusive thing that I was going to be dedicating

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
You know 5 hours of programming to

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Don't you think I would have started advertising it like 6 weeks ago?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
No because if they want to be a surprise

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Then this was the agreement with Microsoft

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
To keep it hush hush super secret

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Until the very end you know

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
What's the point of a surprise?

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I don't know I don't know

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I'm just saying it's bullshit that's all

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
All I'm saying there's other stuff happening

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And that may be completely bullshit

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
But there are other things

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Including I think a story that didn't make

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
It was in show roll but didn't make

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Our show roll

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
About how they had

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
That new Halo game or whatever

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Is being teased on Bungie's site

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
And that there's an announcement

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Coming soon maybe this announcement

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Could come at the same time just saying

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
There's kind of smoke here

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
That maybe they're going to announce something soon

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
About something so

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
It's still I don't believe they're going to do

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
A 5 hour long thing on G4 but who knows

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Maybe there's something

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Somewhere in the middle ground that's coming

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Just saying cause you know all those Microsoft rumors

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
You know they always seem to come true somehow

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So I don't know

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Well some people are very excited about this rumor

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Acteft in chat says Project Gotham Racing 5

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Developed by the Forza team do want

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Could be very interesting

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I'm kind of I want to see

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
You know what I'm actually more excited about

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
As sad as this is

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
What game Blizzard

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Not Blizzard

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
What game Bazaar is developing

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
With Blizzard, Activision

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
You know that whole thing

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I'm curious what the new thing is they're making

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And I'm hoping you know I'm not as into the Project Gotham

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And Forza games as much as I am

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
The more simple racing games so to speak

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
You know I'm not like super into cars

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
But I like the more need for speed burnout type games

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
But I love

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Dumb simple like dumb dumb dumb

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Simple racing games like F-Zero and Mario Kart

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And I would love it if they would make

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
A next gen like dumb racing game

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
That's like F-Zero

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I really want like a next gen F-Zero game

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Can't you tell how many times have I said it on the show

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I wish that would be what

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
They'd announce at Nintendo's press events

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Coming up, wouldn't that be nice

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Well meanwhile there are other games you can play

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
One of them is Grid

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
It's a game I didn't particularly care for it

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
But hey I do like I do support when games

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Further extend the life

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
With some extra content and Grid is going to be

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Extending its life with some new cars

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And some new events

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And some new download content that's coming out

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
It's called the 8 Ball Pack

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
It's supposed to be coming out this fall

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
There's going to be two brand new multiplayer things

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
And eight new cars, hence the name of the 8 Ball Pack

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
A McLaren F1 GTR

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
A Honda S2000

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
A 1971 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Are some of the new things you can look for

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
The expansion will be released for the Xbox 360

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
And Playstation 3

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
It's going to also bring some new achievements

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Four new achievements, 100 gamer score

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Of course on the Playstation 3 that would be trophies

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
So there's also going to be some new multiplayer events as well

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
It's pretty cool

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Not quite specific on what the price is going to be for this

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Or what the exact release date is

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
But just plan on it soon

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
As in this fall

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
If you're a Grid player

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Well something else that's coming soon

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Is the Playstation firmware 2.5

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
That's going to be likely later October

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And supposedly simultaneously with that

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
It will be the release of Home 1.0

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
So finally the beta will be over

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:22.000
And you'll actually be able to participate in it

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
And it says they're waiting for a system software update

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
To the PS3 to deal with this

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I guess some sporadic network issues

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
That they have with Home right now

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And then they're going to

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Reopen it sometime

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I guess this week for thousands of new testers

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
But in October is when they're supposed to bite the bullet

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And actually launch this thing that they've been teasing for a long time now

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Wouldn't it be funny if they just came out in October and go

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Yeah it's coming out spring of 2009

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I'd laugh

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Haven't they guaranteed that it's coming out this year?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
It doesn't matter. They guaranteed that the Playstation 3 was coming out in the spring

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And ended up getting delayed through the fall

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So nothing's guaranteed

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Fair enough

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Are you looking forward to trying out Home?

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
No I don't really care

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
You don't really care?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I'll test it out

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I'm excited about Home. I'll have PS3

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
I honestly don't think it's going to be that great

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I think it's just going to be kind of eh

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Look at what we can do. We're different

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I mean great. It's a way to differentiate themselves

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
We'll see how they actually use it

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Alright

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Well hey, you know what's kind of funny we're talking about

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
We're just joking around in chat right now

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And people were talking about racing games

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
And AlphaCananagram said there is a next gen racing game

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
It's called Crazy Woman Driver

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Also known as Excite Truck

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
And I was kind of like, they should make a game called Crazy Woman Driver

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
But it should be like, not really

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
I'm not trying to say that with malice

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Obviously I don't think all women are crazy drivers

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
But I think there should be a game based around

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Crazy Women Driving

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
So then we get the sequel Small Penis Trucking

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Sure

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Sure fine by me

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
We can have Small Penis Trucking

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Fair enough. Fair is fair

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
We can have both

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Or how about this

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Great Big Rims

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Itty Bitty Penis

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
That could be a sequel

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Would that work for you? I don't know

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Anyhow

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
The reason why I'm saying that is

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I'm tying this into a story about

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
The Power

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Because the Tyra Banks show

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
This is a show that airs during the day

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
And actually I have to admit

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I kind of like the Tyra Banks show

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Because in one of those cheesy

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Over the top type of ways

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Tyra Banks is a very cheesy over the top host

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Well do you remember the Wii Fit Girl?

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I mean how can you forget her right?

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
She was the one on YouTube

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
That her boyfriend taped her

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Doing the whole hula hooping thing

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Obviously showing off her assets

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
And it was very controversial

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Well Tyra Banks had that couple on the show

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
And apparently

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Tyra

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Helped this girl kind of get

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Her revenge on the guy

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And the guy was actually

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
The boyfriend was on the show playing

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
And

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
He actually had to take

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
His pants off

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
And play Wii Fit

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
In his undies to be a delight of the audience

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
And that was actually the

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Audience clapping along there

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And apparently that was done during a commercial break

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Or something and released as a viral video

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And in

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Retrospect it's kind of stupid I mean this story

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Is like how old like two months old

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Listen Tyra Banks is trying to be

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Edgy and trying to be all like

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
She's edgy like 90 days late

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
The only

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Time I ever hear about the Tyra Banks show is when I'm

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Watching the soup because they make fun

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Of her because she's retarded

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And I don't know

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
But she also was she did something

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Way back with like World of Warcraft

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Where they destroyed some dudes CDs

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Or something like that

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Yeah you installed the game you dipshit

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
You know I actually walked by at work

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
And I saw that Tyra

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Was on because they have a TV at work and you know

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
They have different channels on during the day and I saw that the Tyra Banks

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Show was on and I actually

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Kind of looked up and I noticed they were showing

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
The YouTube of the Wii Fit girl

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
She was getting ready to introduce her and I was kind of looking

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
At it going this must be a rerun

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
This is like 90 days old

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
No it wasn't it was

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
It was a brand new episode

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Too little too late

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Too little too late so you know

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Late stories I don't know about you

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Guys but they make me a little bit angsty

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So this is when we get into the FUs of the week

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
My FU of the week was towards

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
My sinuses my allergies

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000
My lungs and lots and lots of mucus

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I miss having a voice

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I miss having to eat or drink something hot

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Just to be perfectly audible

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
And um Rob

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
That's the only cool part of it

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Old joke is old

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Alright Loki

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Um I guess

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
My FU of the week goes to the fact

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
That I have to wake up early tomorrow

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Because I have to take my wife's car in

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Apparently she was driving down the street

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Or whatever um doing 50

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.920
year or something and then the car like all sudden stopped accelerating and the

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:40.400
check engine light came on then it started accelerating again so that's

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:49.160
usually not a good thing so yeah I hate waking up really um my a few of the week

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.880
goes to something I've been spending a lot of time on lately and my a few of

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:56.840
the week goes to Proposition 8 I don't usually get very politically motivated

01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:00.920
on the show but amen seeing as this is something that directly affects my

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.760
rights and you know we've done this show for free for how long pardon me while I

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.680
get on my soapbox for a minute if you live in California even if you don't

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:11.840
live in California please tell people that you know that live in California to

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:15.480
vote no on Proposition 8 and Proposition 8 is basically an initiative on the

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:18.760
ballot that's looking to ban same-sex marriage which is already legal in

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:24.360
California thanks just a court decision a few months ago and I believe in

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.720
equality and fairness for all and you know despite however a person might feel

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:33.560
about gay marriage personally it's not gonna hurt you if two guys or two women

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:37.160
get married and you know go on with their lives and raise a family and I

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.440
think it's just I think the whole thing is so stupid and I can't believe that

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:45.400
people pour millions and millions of dollars into what I basically see as in

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:50.080
this opinion hate when I see people donating money to this yes on a campaign

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:53.920
I see hate because that's what it is a discrimination of the 21st century and

01:37:53.920 --> 01:38:00.920
it stinks ignorance it's just ignorance it's ignorant I mean I know I know I

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:04.440
could go on for days no no I fully agree with you it's absolutely disgusting I

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:10.080
mean honestly I would love to see marriage made illegal to begin with no

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:17.920
no no I understand be strictly reduced to a religious institution separation of

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:21.600
church and state have that wall that you know Jefferson intended when he wrote

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:27.000
the damn phrase right now and have the government should anyone would think

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.280
that the government wouldn't love for there to be more married people it's it's

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.320
good for the economy tax taxes and think of other wedding money that goes in the

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.260
economy but anyway anyway look I could go on for days and days it's a video

01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:44.000
game show I don't want to but you know just please you know this is gonna set a

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
precedent for the nation here and you know it's very very important that we

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.360
defeat proposition 8 on the ballot it just it pisses me off that they lie they

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.880
freaking lie when they call people they say that if this proposition is defeated

01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.920
the churches are going to be forced to marry that Mormon churches the church

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:04.520
that don't want to do are going to be forced to marry that is not true it's

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:08.360
straight-up not true look like the Catholic Church actually they're very

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.960
strict they can and can't marry because they have both have to be Catholic as

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:18.040
far as I'm aware and all this other stuff is no you're absolutely right I

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:22.600
think it's stupid and ridiculous and those should dedicate a podcast just to

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:26.040
it oh god oh I could just go on for days and days days anyway you know what for

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:30.360
those folks to think that you know gay marriage is gonna ruin the sanctity of

01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:36.280
marriage I've got three words for you Britney fucking Spears all right back to

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:42.280
video games hug hug kiss kiss I love everybody I really all right Britney

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:49.520
fucking Spears that's awesome you know what what that's another pocket we need

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:53.680
to do a political podcast someday you know I actually actually and I will go

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:57.840
ahead and say this on the air you know cuz you know me I'm very opinionated

01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:07.600
about my ideas you know Rob I'm just messing but maybe maybe we should do

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.680
some type of a new sub podcast a political can we should do something

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:16.760
called I don't know if Loki's down with it I just like to pissed off nerds I

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:22.320
should call the show to pissed off huh I joined the ECA yeah there you get lots

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:26.520
of information from them why not maybe you know it's about time people put

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:30.640
their foot down and said screw you guys I'm going belly know what I'm pissed off

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.240
that podcast is limiting my bandwidth to 250 gigabytes a month you know what that

01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:37.920
is something else to get pissed off that's a different political thing but

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.960
yeah that is angry I like that idea to pissed off nerds we'll see if there's

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:49.000
already a pot there's got to be I'm sure there's one called angry that's 62,500

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:54.040
songs at four megabytes per song that that's basically our 125 standard

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.800
definition movies well you know what I download that much actually I don't but

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:05.920
I do monitor my downloading now gs68 says pissed off nerds wouldn't that be

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.800
under sedation life that's a good point they might already have a corner on that

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.320
mark they also have an angry video game nerd who's kind of retarded he's awesome

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:17.360
that's different though because that's actually about video games awesome any

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:21.360
place he plays the games and talk shit about them and they usually are shitty

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.800
games I'm I don't know what I'm not gonna say my show Nintendo nerd didn't

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:30.480
begin the angry video game I'm a fan of independent productions we'll just leave

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:34.800
it up but let's do it well so we'll look into it when two twin powers activate

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:37.880
will love a bucket explore the possibilities all right video games hey

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:44.840
damn it guess what's coming out a virtual console overseas they're getting

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:51.680
the master system Sonic the Hedgehog isn't that pretty cool and then some

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:57.800
Commodore 64 games Rob Boulder dash do Boulder dash is awesome and guess what

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.240
there was like a million of those Boulder dash games I know what else

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:06.840
jump man cool jump man I'd love jump man why are we getting these over here I

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:11.560
played jump man standards I think they had it over here our jump man jump man

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:15.360
generous no I don't I know we had those I had jump man junior was the first game

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:19.880
I ever owned on my Commodore 64 well jump man if I'm if I'm right this is the

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.680
jump man that led to us getting Donkey Kong wasn't in a way yeah I mean it's

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:29.400
very similar the way they were laid out but the first hero in Donkey Kong was

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.800
called jump man before he became Mario remember yeah but it's not I mean the

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:38.040
games aren't related but I mean the but well they're they're not related in

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:42.560
design but they're related in the fact that they kind of are similar with the

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:45.320
ladders checks and ladders type of gameplay I always thought that they were

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:50.360
related but oh well I just beat me no different design companies one was

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:55.280
Japanese one was American yeah um this one says it was a pixie they did um

01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:01.920
mousetrap didn't they uh yeah they did mouse trap I love that they did but I

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:05.440
thought epics did jump but then they did jump in junior um it is epic someone was

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:09.360
reading it wrong yeah dead epics did like summer games and winter games it had

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:15.960
a lot of great great games on clique of vision that's what I played it on is the

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:19.920
clique of vision yeah I got to play a little bit here of just some of this

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:23.040
stuff from jump man jr.

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:30.400
I know it's jumping jr. not jump man but it's the same same same freaking thing

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:35.480
I remember setting it up to go really fast funny yeah you could set your speed

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:38.360
in this game that was the amazing thing about it is that like you could have the

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:43.680
speed be so freaky fast it was like unreal

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.160
so where's some actual gameplay noise I love that game oh this game was so

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:54.600
amazing sorry we're living in a little dot oh yes you have to avoid that killer

01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:02.640
dot anyway sorry okay we're done reminiscing uh me too I don't know that

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.280
was it that was a good virtual console update well it's not fair that they get

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:10.520
it there we don't get it I know even though I'm on my little boy I might

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.600
break my boycott for jump man honestly that's awesome I think that we will

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:22.040
though you know I think the tiger class said what the fuck is that sound it

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:27.160
sounds like someone jacking off at warp speed it was the sound of him running

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:31.120
you have to see that go go YouTube jump man jr. you'll see it funny or what's

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:38.600
faster it is it's super slow too you can choose the pace that you want to jack

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:51.480
off at a medium pace yeah anyhow oh yes we can only make that you know

01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:57.960
transition from virtual console the porn anyways so from jacking off to

01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:06.400
PlayStation 3 news yeah exactly Oh Sony how you make the funnies I seriously

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:10.760
wonder if they're trying this on purpose now but apparently the Sony PlayStation

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:18.840
3 just launched into the Malaysia region and during their little party that they

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:24.520
were you know talking about you know how great Sony is and stuff like that they

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:31.720
were introducing different speakers and stuff including one of which is now a

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:37.160
pseudo the managing director of Sony Malaysia and he was taken to the stage

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:43.400
with a very familiar not Sony related video game theme and it's absolutely

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:48.240
hilarious because they were playing the Legend of Zelda theme for him walking up

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:56.920
to the stage wow how did they not catch that I don't know but of course someone

01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:02.560
just get the wrong CD in the mixer maybe that's a really wrong CD wrong platform

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:05.920
only that's something you shouldn't have even been in the building right exactly

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:10.360
so that was kind of funny they have the video on YouTube you know definitely

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:17.720
check it out because it's pretty funny so that is it and of course Kotaku ran

01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:22.040
the story the or one of the stories is that even the Imperial March would have

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:28.440
been a better choice all right well every week on this program we like to

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.360
give you a chance to give us some feedback not just through the chat room

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.720
at chat.org.com or the phone calls which we'll get to later but through our mail

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.000
bag and every week you guys send us emails and we pick a few of them to read

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.040
on the show or in tonight's case we're probably gonna read a lot of them on the

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:50.600
show tonight actually it's a statement we call the OLR mailbag

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:55.360
wrong thing I know but I felt like singing anyway by the way I know I still

01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:00.800
do that when I hear it I still hear it in my head. You've ruined me Rob, you've ruined me.

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:05.080
usually dark soccer reads the emails but as you know she's a little bit under the

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:08.440
weather tonight thanks to stuff in the air so I will be taking over since my

01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:11.960
voice seems to be in good shape even though I was shouting most of the day

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:16.880
gay or straight no on eight anyway moving on we're gonna start off with an

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:21.800
email from Robway it's Rob with two B's I just got infinite undiscovery I noticed

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:26.520
the action RPG fights a lot like say Kingdom Hearts could this be an initial

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:33.040
run with a new RPG engine any thoughts hmm interesting theory but would Kingdom

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:36.720
Hearts be on the 360 I don't think so an infinite of discovery I think is a 360

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.880
exclusive but it would be a killer exclusive but I think most people have

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:43.680
kind of already chalked up the fact that in the rumors are saying the Kingdom

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:47.040
Hearts is gonna be on the 360 but if you remember they don't be on PlayStation

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:50.320
3 if you remember they develop all their games on PC so it wouldn't matter

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:54.360
anyway true so you know yeah absolutely it could be a cross-platform thing but

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:58.520
just something to think about by the way he also wants to add a PS if you haven't

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:02.920
yet played the game early on in the game is a village called new land this is

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:06.640
spoiler free don't worry in order to ensure you don't have to restart the

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.600
game save the game as soon as you find the save point do not overwrite that

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:16.440
save until you have completed the task they're a tip from Rob with two B's that

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:20.960
might save some of you guys some headaches we have another question here

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:25.920
this individual did not sign their email but I think it's spasnator because I see

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:28.480
it in the email address even though I'm not gonna give the whole email address

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.740
but we'll just say that hi folks I have some questions for you again I hope you

01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:35.120
don't mind that most of them are of a semi quasi political in nature hey no

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:38.800
that's okay we're kind of on a political tangent tonight one given that we're

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.080
experiencing all this economic turmoil do you see this affecting the video game

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.340
industry in any way shape or form what do you guys think with the reset with

01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:51.440
the current economy situation affect the video game industry well it's a lot of

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:57.480
banks that are going poor so it's not like I mean people really aren't seeing

01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.440
a lot of people becoming poor because of the situation that's going on right now

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:05.720
unless I guess you're you own a bank and in which case you probably before but no

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:10.040
I don't think it's gonna affect anything if this continues on for a few years or

01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:13.360
something like that then yeah it's gonna be bad and probably people will be more

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:18.400
conservative with their game spending so they won't buy as much in my opinion and

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:22.560
this is only the dumbest answer in some ways yes in some ways no yes because

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.040
people have less disposable income and video games are funded by disposable

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:30.400
income but no because video games are a global market not just made for the US

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:33.200
so I don't think they're necessarily gonna stop developing games because they

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:35.800
still sell in Japan they still sell in Europe and other countries and it might

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:39.120
not be experiencing the same thing we're experiencing so something to think about

01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:42.680
number two with the election coming up not too long from now and given the fact

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.000
that both Obama and McCain are in a virtual tie currently in polls do you

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.600
think either one of them will reach out to gamers seeing as a good chunk of the

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.200
population or gamers most of which are old enough to vote honestly you want my

01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:00.840
honest answer no because unfortunately there's still that stigma in the the

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:04.440
place out there and I'm not reading from the email this is my off the top of my

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:09.300
head I say no because there's still a big negative aura that goes with video

01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:13.800
games thanks to people like Jack Voldemort and people that you know video

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.280
games are bad and bloody and violent and you know it's that old mentality that

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.040
Dungeons & Dragons makes people kill people in real life unfortunately that's

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:24.600
still around so unfortunately I don't think you're ever gonna see Obama McCain

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.120
siding with the gamers in that respect because I think it would for them sadly

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:33.960
would do more harm than good and it's sad don't get me wrong but that's why

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:37.680
it's important that gamers you know that's why things like ECA and so on are

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:42.120
important because gamers get a voice then gamers get their political clout

01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:47.480
known etc etc this one isn't so much a question back to the email as it is a

01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:50.540
random idea or thought I had and would like to have you guys be my sounding

01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:53.560
board do you think it may be a decent idea if sometime down the road there was

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:57.400
a political post either on a volunteer basis or salaried that had two functions

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:00.960
advise the president on all things video game entertainment related and also did

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:03.920
some public education on video games basically dispelling myths

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:07.800
misconceptions stereotypes and anything Jack douchebag says about video games I

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:11.240
was thinking that if something like this was in place perhaps things will

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:16.120
eventually simmer down something like it is in place it's called the ECA it's

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.920
just not officially government sanctioned but that's you know you're on

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:22.560
the right track with what you're thinking about but again for the same

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:25.560
reasons I stated before you're not going to see the government just start to

01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:29.520
embrace video games like that you know what I mean but I think what you're

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:33.480
talking about that's the type of thing that the ECA is looking to bring

01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:37.600
awareness to so check it out if you haven't already because I think they're

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:44.080
looking for politically minded people like you agree disagree I think so all

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.360
right that was and I think so all right moving on to the next email this is from

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:56.440
I am a B hi olr I was wondering if you guys are still going to do pyramid head

01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:00.520
rape appreciation day and if so when is it anyways keep up the great work and I

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:04.000
hope to see you guys in future cons you know I'm afraid we may have missed it I

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.920
forgot completely about it we haven't missed the other game hasn't come out

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:09.920
yet it's moved so I thought it was supposed to be the day after Silent Hill

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:15.240
2's release no I think we were doing this just to make it easy the release of

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.600
Silent Hill homecoming doesn't homecoming come out in like two weeks

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:21.960
yeah it's on the 30th see I always thought oh it's it's almost around that

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:26.640
same time anyway because September 25th so that would be like in four days what

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:30.520
is it yeah it's like the day no I'm sorry September 24th the Wednesday so

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.600
her 24th was the day that it was originally released on the PlayStation

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:38.080
2 in 2001 I just I don't know if it would be yeah just do it on the 30th it

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:43.680
makes it easy or for Halloween you know I don't think we have any officially run

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:48.580
events this year but I think what you should do you should if it's go see

01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:52.160
the hard thing is I don't want to say run out by Silent Hill homecoming

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:56.080
because I don't know it might suck so what you should do is play a Silent Hill

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:59.800
game yeah play a Silent Hill game like Silent Hill 2 that's really good and

01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:03.120
then wait for our review I'm after the game comes out and if it's good you'll

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:06.720
buy that too and that's how you can praise pyramid head but if you do want

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:10.320
to take little pictures of pyramid heads and send them in to us or creative

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:15.240
pyramid head usage in public then I would love to run them on the front page

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:20.160
of our site I think that would be fun so maybe just kind of like a general end of

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:25.520
September time frame I don't know about having a rape appreciation day people

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:30.120
would like that too much but the only rape of monsters remember not rape of

01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:42.640
humans all right let's go on to another email that comes from see it's not

01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:48.760
signed oh yes it is geek boy 2424 woohoo I finally got an Xbox 360 OMG it is so

01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:52.480

friends list my gamer tag is geek boy 2424 see you guys on live this email is

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:03.920
brought to you by me home of the endless amounts of happiness check out the

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:07.240
forums and the oil army thread there's a whole thread where we're exchanging

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:11.960
gamer tags sadly my friends list is full but if you send me a really nice message

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:14.880
I'll usually try to find somebody on there who hasn't signed in xbox live in

01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:18.640
like 30 days and delete them to make room for new listeners or just somebody

01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:24.280
who I've never exchanged a message with or anything so yeah send me a message if

01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:27.200
you want but instead of giving you the gamer tags out over the air we're gonna

01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:31.600
make it work for it so I head on over the forums and check that out or listen

01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:37.280
to a previous episode where we did give give it out I think there was one other

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:40.720
email I wanted to read here and we're not gonna be able to get to all the

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:43.000
emails this week but I think we'll read this one and this will be the last one

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.200
tonight and it comes to us from Dan shadow hey guys Dan shadow here hope you

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:51.880
all had a great talk like a pirate day this last Friday I had my fair share of

01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:57.440
grog I can tell you that hmm talk like a pirate day did you guys do anything to

01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.920
celebrate I said our once I didn't are like a pirate you acted like one though

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:08.240
yeah I think I posted on my Twitter hey zero day leet where's coming to my site

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:14.440
check it out dudes that was my talk like a pirate thing some some things have

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:17.880
been on my mind lately it seems the only way developers can move forward is to

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.000
move laterally we have been seeing games adopt aspects of other genres to fix

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.320
some of their problems this has been incredibly popular so far look at look

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:29.000
Grand Theft Auto for instance when this game was went 3d all they did was to

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.800
take a crappy driving game with a crappy shooter put you in the big world to play

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:36.440
in it seems to me that if there's an abundance of things to do people will

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:41.560
overlook the quality of the gameplay retort not necessarily I think the

01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:45.360
driving is good in it and it's not really a crappy game now however they're

01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:48.880
crappy minigames that they threw in there like crappy bowling crappy darts

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.680
and crappy billiards yes that does suck and that does feel very tacked on and

01:55:54.680 --> 01:56:01.760
this crappy but the game itself fun do you think that it's a so you don't think

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:04.560
it's a crappy shooter and crapping driving game kind of no not all I think

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:07.760
they I mean having played some of the other multiplayer Grand Theft Auto games

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:12.520
which were only on PSP unfortunately they fixed a lot of things there's a lot

01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:17.160
of things they haven't fixed but you know they each have their own little

01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:22.160
nuances my problem with Grand Theft Auto is now that I've finished the game

01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.560
unless I play multiplayer there's not much for me to do in it it's not really

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:33.640
fun anymore there's not a lot of I don't know fun things to do in it I

01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:38.440
guess I have more to this email from Dan shadow I just wonder if the developers

01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:41.840
are having problems with moving a genre forward without having to distract the

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.760
gamer with aspects of more popular games this work so far but I don't want to see

01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:49.960
RPG elements in every single game nor do I want to have a driver in my RPG on the

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:53.320
surface you'll see big-time shooters that are hardcore on the surface once

01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:56.440
you go online you're riddled with customization experience points and

01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:00.320
guild systems where do you think the genres are going do you think there's

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:05.880
room for more than one great single genre game each year yes but you know

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:09.760
what the problem is I think and thanks for your mouth I think a big prior the

01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:14.920
problem is that because of the way like Christmas is a lot of games get

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:18.560
overlooked because they all come out between September to December I think

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.760
more great games we get recognized if they would learn how to evenly space

01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:25.640
them out throughout the years starting to get that I I think a little bit yes

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:29.240
but my god I feel overwhelmed right now with all the games I want to play I mean

01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:34.640
really the other thing too also is that I mean what they're trying to do is

01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:38.920
attract more people to their game and the problem is if they keep putting out

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.480
the same game and not trying to incorporate these little elements that

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:46.000
maybe will attract an RPG player or maybe we'll attract someone who's really

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.920
into bowling or something that's really what they're trying to do to get they're

01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:54.560
kind of trying to branch out a little bit I think the real problem comes down

01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.440
to these companies but not games that aren't finished or aren't working

01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:04.880
correctly or haven't been properly bug tested or anything I mean seriously

01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:09.080
mercenaries to what the fuck that game is not done there is no way that they

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:13.720
can say oh yeah we've ironed out all the bugs in that one no they did not in fact

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:16.760
they probably will just look at it figure out what's wrong with it and then

01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:20.360
later on they can go patch it because it made better business sense for them at

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.600
the time to release it when they did because there wasn't a lot coming out

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.640
around then and they figure they're gonna get a lot more sales that way at

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:31.200
the same time people say their game is shit interesting comment from Xenocore

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:35.320
in our chat room the problem is the same reason we all have these big-budget games

01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:40.800
too many suits in the industry I'm kind of curious to see what XNA is gonna do

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:43.360
to all this you know you know I keep talking about I really think this is

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:46.120
gonna be a big freaking deal and I know I make a big deal about it on the show

01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:50.680
but come on I mean it is a distribution platform for independent games to really

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:55.480
get noticed I'm very curious to see what this does to gaming if anything I could

01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:59.120
be wrong it could have the impact of just a little pebble I think if they do

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:02.720
anything right they could be a big volcano too and I hate to say this like

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:07.360
the Apple App Store where a lot of people putting stuff on there and it

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:11.120
spreads like wildfire really quick and that's part of the reason why sorry

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:15.960
Logie but the iPhone is murdering is because you don't see that type of in

01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:19.760
enabling on other phones that are out there like the instinct and all those

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:23.280
other things you know I'm and I'm sure some angry emailer who's anti Apple and

01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:25.600
pro sprint or whatever's gonna email me telling me about things I'm not

01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:30.320
considering but whatever Apple's doing a great job marketing their marketplace

01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:33.920
and getting it out there that you know any idiot can make these applications

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:37.240
that you know some of them are very exciting like you know the whole built

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:43.280
in Twitter and you know just everything they've got it's great so that's part of

01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:47.320
why the iPhones kicking a lot of button why everybody really wants one well not

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:50.240
everybody but a lot of people all right that was it for mailbag hey why don't

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:53.200
you send us an email for consideration to be read up next week mailbag at

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:56.760
orange laundry calm very sorry to those emails we didn't get to this week just

01:59:56.760 --> 02:00:00.320
realized we didn't run out of time but we did read them all and we lulled at

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:03.840
your improper grammar just kidding but we also praised you when you had good

02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:09.560
grammar let's get back some gaming news Loki yes well the big trend now is to

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:14.280
release movies based on games release talk about it so of course the next game

02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:19.320
that they're talking about making a movie for would be Mass Effect and

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:27.680
apparently AV Arad I guess the guy behind a bunch of good comic book movie

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:36.160
franchises is has been rumored to be or to have optioned the game for movie so

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:41.320
we'll have to see if this actually ends up happening because you know like other

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:50.800
games like Halo it doesn't end up coming out so yeah I think great let's see if

02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:54.960
there's a good quality movie made here but unfortunately so far track record

02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:02.480
hasn't been too favorable I am I do have a little bit of I guess moderately high

02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:07.920
hopes for Max Payne because that looks kind of cool and hit man I guess wasn't

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:14.360
that bad but I didn't see it so I can't really judge was not good well if one

02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:17.760
movie wasn't enough there's another movie coming out is coming out in Germany

02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:23.440
why Germany because that's right the man who brought you postal among with other

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:28.400
great cinematic fair label has made a new movie it's called far cry yippie

02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:33.360
skippy and it's getting its German premiere on October 2nd so expect the

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:40.520
first reviews to hit the internet around them I call it a far cry from good now

02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:45.040
now you can't hate it until you've seen it no I can hate it because it's doable

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:51.400
or available and yes his track record speaks for himself I'm sorry I'm waiting

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:56.200
for the fluke to happen where all sudden it's just cinematic you know mastery but

02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:00.800
it's not it's really not going to be good by the way I'm Tiger Claw reminds

02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:03.860
me of something I read on the internet this week he says oh speaking of label

02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:07.480
he's also coming out with his own video games you hear about that yeah tunnel

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:11.840
rats when we interviewed him he actually talked about that a little bit I think

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.680
it's supposed to come out like next year and they had a trailer for the game which

02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:22.360
looks okay I guess it looked kind of boring but the graphics were all right

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:28.040
because if ruining one entertainment genre wasn't enough or Zach deft calls

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:33.680
him way balls he really just he needs to find his niche that he's good at

02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:38.200
obviously games aren't it and he just really wants to use games because it's

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:45.200
an excuse about meditating far away from here what's his name talking well he

02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:49.080
just wants to make genre films but it's like kind of like oh I just want to play

02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:52.740
around with making movies you know he's not even really that serious about it

02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:59.920
frisbee suggests in chat room the wonderfully mature name of boob way balls

02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:03.920
why not we give new people we give people new names on this show all the

02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:08.880
time maybe we should officially call him boo boy balls you know what what why do

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:13.880
we give him press I don't know because sometimes you can't help it's like a

02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:18.280
train wreck you know you don't want to look but you can't help but turn your

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.200
head and go because I wonder how bad it is because we have to warn people

02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:26.440
because there are some people that are like ooh Far Cry Far Cry video game

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:32.720
movie you know sadly enough the thing is you know obviously we can't reach a lot

02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:36.320
of people but the people that listen to us can reach their friends and their

02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:39.760
friends will reach their friends and eventually more these movies will make

02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:43.920
it less into the theaters more direct-to-video and less people will buy

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:49.240
them because unfortunately these sell like crazy on DVD and I don't know why

02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.200
because people apparently are stupid well people like their bad movie

02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:58.040
collection it's MST 3k syndrome right exactly it is I'm actually wanting to

02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:01.120
know if the any of those riff tracks have been done to a new a bowl film

02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:07.440
because I bet that would be funny anyway awesome moving on um for people who are

02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:13.200
Sega fans like myself there are actually going to be a new game coming out it's

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:19.000
Harley Davidson king of the road and you know they did Harley Davidson in LA

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:27.680
writers not too long ago well like ten years ago but now they're going to have

02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:35.720
it on a full-size Harley on a 62 inch screen and it's gonna have a very 70s

02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:43.320
rock soundtrack with Deep Purple and Steppin Wolf and it's on display it was

02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:49.720
on display the Tokyo amusement show so I want awesome

02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:54.760
very cool uh Harley games that could be kind of awesome it could also be kind of

02:04:54.760 --> 02:05:01.840
bad but hopefully not yeah I was gonna say there was another arcade game that

02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:05.560
was supposed to be coming out that didn't make our show roll but uh

02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:11.720
elevator action was getting a new arcade game with an actual elevator door on the

02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:18.560
arcade cabinet nice and it's now a shooter game which is interesting so

02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:23.960
kind of cool anyways another thing that's getting changed a little bit is

02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:28.320
Animal Crossing for the Wii the name is actually changed a little bit in

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:32.960
Australia for some reason apparently city folk is not welcome in Australia

02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:39.600
but let's go to the city is so Animal Crossing shall now be known as Animal

02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:47.040
Crossing let's go to the city in Australia make it so why I don't know

02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:51.720
that's the question of the day like is is I gotta know Australian folks is is

02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:55.760
fault did I just insult you by saying folk I mean that's what I want to know

02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:01.760
that's I'm very very curious about what is it so in insulting about city folk

02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:09.360
folk you rub I don't think that's it I don't know the other thing I was gonna

02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:12.360
say well I mean they've done this in the past with other games I mean another

02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:17.960
perfect example would be in the Asian region Africa is no longer known as

02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:23.360
Africa it's known as a kuna matata kuna matata I love it do we talk about that

02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:27.160
last week yes we did Oh God that's a great now see if they'd called the game

02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:32.440
that originally I would be all over that you know what I mean we wouldn't I was a

02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:36.440
game coming I'll call her kuna matata how wondering if they don't do that

02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:43.840
because Disney would be like you're sued yeah Disney will sue Xenocore says it's

02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:47.960
now known as Jumbo Safari that's why they're gonna sell more copies of it I

02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:52.480
wish I wish alright well one more story for you guys then we're gonna open up

02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:56.560
our skype line and you can call us at orange lounge radio on skype or our

02:06:56.560 --> 02:07:00.400
phone number one eight seven seven game olr and this is a story about EA

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:05.040
Microsoft and GameStop what did these three companies have in common well they

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:10.160
were recently awarded perfect scores for the treatment of gay lesbian bisexual

02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:15.080
and transgender employees and that's by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:21.760
it's all in the 2009 corporate equity index here's a comment on this from game

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:26.600
politics comm a comment from the president of the HRC Foundation Joel

02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:31.600
soul Moness the 2009 corporate equality index shows that corporate America

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:35.400
understands that a diverse workforce is critical to remaining successful and

02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:38.360
competitive in the absence of a federal law that prohibits workplace

02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:41.360
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or

02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:45.400
expression it is up to employers to take the lead and implement policies that

02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:49.800
ensure all of their employees are protected game related companies which

02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:55.760
also receive perfect scores include retailers Best Buy and Target PC Dell HP

02:07:55.760 --> 02:08:05.520
Intel eBay Google Yahoo and Apple so nice very nice you know it's it's kind

02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:09.240
of sad but you know you might be thinking well why is this news because

02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:13.680
sadly there are some companies out there where it's okay to discriminate based on

02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:18.840
that stuff and it's time to get out of your cave and really to be honest it's

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:25.640
GameStop they just treat everyone like shit so but at least at least it's fair

02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:30.040
everybody is treated everybody is treated like shit so at least it's it's

02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:33.840
non-discriminatory that's the important thing and I'm fine with that as long as

02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:37.520
everybody's treated like shit all right anyway we're gonna treat you like shit

02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:41.880
now when you call us at Orson's radio on Skype or our phone number one eight

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:47.200

02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:50.600
deserve it meanwhile while we wait for some calls you have any last-minute

02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:57.520
stories Loki yes I do have a few some stuff that I didn't make our show roll

02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:03.980
this week apparently there was a ISO loader being in development for the

02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:10.080
homebrew community much to the dislike of the homebrew community and the

02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:17.080
developer when it cocoa apparently it got leaked out which is not good and now

02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:21.160
the developer said you didn't get the full version then so fuck you all

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:23.960
yikes alright let's go to the phone real quick we'll come back to the story how

02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:27.720
you're on orange on radio is this you know what up guys it's in a corporate

02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:28.520
quest

02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:33.000
hey Zina core from ultimate quest what is on your mind my friend a few things

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.880
first of all ducked a new Knight Rider for public safety type thing you know

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:41.040
that get that get that get that did that premiere tonight or something

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.440
no but I caught it on Hulu and that's it's like how many sharks can you jump

02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:52.840
in one show my god record or something it doesn't know how to do the show no

02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:56.720
hassle Hoff equals instant fail I mean it doesn't take a genius to recognize

02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:02.480
that the only cool thing I liked in there was even though I dislike the

02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:06.200
whole mission support type thing going on the one Asian chick in there that

02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.920
speaks my languages that's always throwing off one-liners is hilarious but

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.240
other than that that shows garbage potential for a good video game out of

02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:17.880
the new Knight Rider series hell no too many effects they put ground effects on

02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:21.560
kit for crying out loud he jumped over guys and there's shit glowing on the

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:24.960
bottom that said kr it's like what this thing run through the hood hood or

02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:29.800
something get some rims like I missed spinning like good lord how much crap

02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:34.280
can you bolt on him I mean and he transformed into an f-150 of all things

02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:37.120
my god I got so much hate for the show all right well look I know you didn't

02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:40.040
call in just to bash on Knight Rider what what's going on here what what

02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:48.880
actually what from what I've seen of the new Knight Rider show I thought the

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:53.240
little of you know TV movie that they did that kind of like pilot the thing I

02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:57.320
thought it was pretty good I mean I don't know all right look I did have

02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.760
hope until I saw episode one okay like no spirit unless the hoffs involved I'm

02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:04.800
not watching it anywhere but anyway I don't even talk just about Knight Rider

02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:09.080
what's on the gaming world all right Rob have you played Warhammer online yet I

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:11.720
have I I don't know I think you came into the show late tonight but I talked

02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:15.960
about during my gaming week in part a hmm yeah I kind of missed that I was

02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:19.200
busy with some stuff no that's right yeah I'm like so far man what do you

02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.120
what do you do you like it now here's my thing I had some likes I had some

02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:25.280
dislikes I liked some of the new things that Warhammer brought to the table

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:29.200
especially in the PvP area like I really liked some of the RVR combat that I

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:32.320
played I thought some of the scenarios are pretty awesome and I like the idea

02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:36.720
of the public questing but I thought the interface was very clunky I don't know

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:40.360
if it's just me I found the interface to be like really clunky especially

02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:45.760
compared to some more fluid interfaces that I've used well the interface for me

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:50.000
I actually was able to manage all the information well I mean maybe it's

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.840
because I'm used to looking at cluttered screens but I saw everything I needed to

02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:57.000
see in there I don't need to pull up at this it's like if they would have buried

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.960
it into like a window that you have to pull up nobody would really want to use

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:05.000
it I just want to just put everything up there just make the colors bright enough

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.440
so where you can still see the stuff even though it's just like one or two

02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:11.520
pixels wide and it worked and you can still see a lot of the game and have all

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:14.800
the information that you need plus a lot of this stuff for the interface that

02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:17.760
they include on the back end like highlighting quest areas and everything

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.160
else I thought was kind of brilliant so yeah that's kind of a nice plus is that

02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:24.160
yeah it actually kind of shows you where to go for quests which you know you

02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.640
might be thinking well it's helping you cheat on the game but you know what god

02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:30.520
people do that with Wow all the time you know they're just looking up online how

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:34.600
to beat the quest so you know why not build it into the game a little bit it's

02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:38.040
not like people aren't going to tell you specifically where to go or show you on

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.600
your app you know it works in the roleplay sense yeah but orcs are finally

02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.640
done right this is the way orcs are supposed to be people blizzard stole it

02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:51.200
from from games workshop this is the way they're supposed to be oh you know the

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:57.920
cut yes it fungus though you must be a chaos player oh yeah I am I just I tried

02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:02.760
the the human side was like this is boring I do this and wow let me switch

02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:06.360
over to the other one and you know like all the all the dark elves listen the

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:10.720
metal they refused to dance it's like that's the way it should be it's not

02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:14.400
evil I've been playing a high elf it's been kind of fun because I feel like I'm

02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:19.480
going around judging everyone it's fun yeah yeah I loved it every time I click

02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:24.040
on slash dance like so-and-so refuses to dance it's like I should be right there

02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:29.880
are you suggesting that your night elf is judge dread no she's more of a judge

02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:36.200
Hershey actually but you know whatever isn't that the one on divorce court no

02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:39.800
there's a judge Hershey in judge dreads just a female one oh god okay I'm

02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:45.440
thinking okay I'm thinking a TV show I noticed a female once but whatever so so

02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:49.000
you're like in Warhammer online for somebody that's never played an MMO

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.520
before in their life let's say they're just turned off by the whole MMO idea is

02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:56.520
there anything for them in Warhammer that might change your mind well this is

02:13:56.520 --> 02:14:00.760
a good gateway drug for a while like experience definitely especially with

02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:05.520
the public quests you get to see what a large-scale battle would be like without

02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:08.680
having to worry about getting ganked in the back and all this other stuff by

02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:13.120
other players so that's the good entry entry level once they include the like

02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.200
like a free trial or something for people to get in they don't be kind of

02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:19.520
good that's a really good way of explaining is you know core I think it's

02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:22.920
the best way you kind of explain it is like you're getting to sample what end

02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:29.400
game is like at level five that's what's kind of awesome and also when you go

02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:34.800
around versus realm like if you actually go into like the the closed like a was

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:40.240
it they captured a flag and stuff like that they they took a note from City of

02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:43.600
Heroes and sidekick you up to those appropriate levels so that way you can

02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:46.800
actually do something at level one if you wanted to that is so I brought up

02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:50.960
the same point I thought it was great too I thought it was great yeah but

02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:54.520

San Diego coming to the yes does it have the doo-wop group no it does not have to

02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:44.720
walk right if I find it but it's an adventure game with learning curve it's

02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.440
got a you know a high-standing 3d graphics I've never heard that

02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:56.280
description before but uh coming some time soon I don't know where ladies and

02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:17.600
gentlemen I give you I want this fucking song in rock band yes I realize there's

02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:31.400
no guitar drums I don't give a shit not just the show but the game itself was

02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:37.120
actually she also had a cool cartoon series yes that that's the best theme

02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:45.720
song to any game show ever love it we're not our phones not really ringing

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:50.040
tonight I guess we're very we have a very apathetic crowd and I at least one

02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:52.840
more call I mean no offense to Xenocore but I don't want him to be the only one

02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:57.840
that's on the show tonight apparently we are going to be harder to mod now that

02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:03.600
they are being in case some of their drive I season are being encased epoxy

02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:07.640
so you actually have to dissolve that ship freakin mod it or you can use one

02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:10.400
of the contacts on the bottom of the board so it's not impossible but just

02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:18.000
making it a little harder and if you're not into booting say backed-up games you

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.160
can still do import games with a bunch of new stuff including gecko OS version

02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:29.720
1.07 which will now allow you to boot import games without a mod chip hello

02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:34.660
Rama you're on orange lounge radio what's up not too much holy call cuz you

02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:39.800
said nobody else is calling it hey that's alright we you know yeah that's

02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:43.680

02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:46.240
show again we love having you on what's on your mind what's what's going on in

02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:50.360
your game world this week although not too much on me and my roommate we're

02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:58.080
kind of pissed at GameStop huh really hmm yeah what a shock why why what now

02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:01.360
let's let's get off the list hey we should actually you know we should have

02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:05.480
we should do that you know I want to do okay we need to do this how can we do

02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:08.760
this okay in the studio I don't know if you see on Justin TV right now in the

02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:11.880
studio there's a big blank I'm sorry it's better there's a big blank space

02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:16.400
right here and I'm thinking what we ought to do is we ought to start over

02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:20.960
here like a giant poster board and just a big list things that piss us off about

02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:26.680
GameStop and we'll just have a list and start adding to it as people call in and

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:30.600
and what have you I like that maybe I don't know what do you guys think in

02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:33.680
chat is that good good idea about it what do you guys think here to you maybe

02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:40.640
it should be like put them on Arnold I think my notice putting them on things

02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:44.800
on notice this week on the thing is real whiteboard I should okay I'm gonna go

02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:48.320
target this we can get a whiteboard and we're either gonna do a game solvers or

02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:53.320
a list of things on notice this week so we'll see all right well Rama sorry I

02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:55.520
know that's not what you want to call about what what pissed you off about

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:59.960
GameStop well me and the roommate we were planning on picking up rock band

02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:04.880
two and he loves the drums so like let's get the new drum kit so we I called over

02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:09.160
to make sure they had it in stock that I asked him are you buying back the old

02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:13.200
rock band one drum kit I'm like they should know like oh no we're not buying

02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:18.920
them back and I'm like how come we're just not click Wow a wonderful customer

02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:24.480
service yeah so we're probably end up putting them on Craigslist and going to

02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:30.000
another place to buy the arm the drum kit what the hell yeah I know I remember

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.840
calling GameStop once and they were like I'm too busy to answer your question you

02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:37.680
just have to come in the store and I understand that they might actually be

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:41.360
really busy but there's just better ways to say it you know what I mean like

02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:45.080
working in customer service myself I'm kind of an ass saying when it comes to

02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:48.440
things like that you know what I mean it's kind of like you know just just hey

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:52.960

02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:05.680

please cuz you know that might be weird hi you're an orange launch radio who's

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:29.400
this hello orange lounge radio land it is Jason hello Jason land it's orange

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:34.800
lounge radio what's on your mind so speaking apart have you guys seen the

02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:40.280
article that Hart published that had published in the magazine I believe it

02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:43.560
was some time this last week about the Republican National Committee

02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:48.960
specifically McCain using Barracuda in one of his ads yes I somehow had a bad

02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:53.800
feeling you were gonna take this show back to politics what is it you guys

02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:56.720
mentioned earlier you were talking about the tour I had to ask to make sure you

02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:00.080
guys have actually seen it because it was priceless it's fine yes and for

02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:04.680
those that aren't in the know Hart got their feathers ruffled big time because

02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:08.920
one of the nicknames for Sarah Palin who's the vice presidential nominee

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:13.560
issued over the Republican Party one of her nicknames in Alaska with Sarah

02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:18.600
Barracuda I can see Russia from my house Sarah Barracuda so they actually played

02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:21.480
Barracuda at the Republican National Convention which is as you know a very

02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:25.280
popular heart song where you gamers probably know it from Guitar Hero 3

02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:30.120
because in that song in that game and heart was pissed yeah I think they're

02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:34.160
anything but Republican yeah you know and you know a lot of musicians get

02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.200
pissed off and that stuff is used because it makes it look like the

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:39.560
musician endorses that candidate when they often don't remember when it happens

02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:44.360
both remember when Reagan used born in the USA and Springsteen threw a hissy

02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:48.320
over that especially since the song was pretty much about nothing the American

02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:52.800
the Republican Party stands for and I'm sure it works both ways like you know

02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:55.720
there's a lot of artists like country artists and you know I think you've seen

02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:01.960
people on the convention they that were Republican and they probably don't want

02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:06.120
their songs being used and Obama's campaign so it's just politics what a

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:10.400
big mess I seem to remember when I was reading through the news that's actually

02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:14.960
like the third time that artists have not been asked not been directly

02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:18.960
compensated and through a hissy fit over it well specifically public inside of

02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:21.800
the campaign whoever has been getting the music clearances over there needs to

02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:26.520
be sacked and then whoever hired that person also needs to be sacked this is

02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:30.040
quite possibly gonna be a very short answer I had to step out because I

02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:33.560
really needed to get some food during the show but have we covered the epic

02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:38.640
rock band crash and character transfer of doom tonight no what's this about

02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:44.560
what's up I believe it was ssj 100 Matt published a put a link in chat like an

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:49.080
hour and a half ago pretty short shortly after the show started and apparently

02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:56.120
for it looks to be I kind of skimmed but for local games characters created rock

02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:00.920
band two characters would switch profiles that they were bound to like

02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:04.560
they would be written out to the wrong gamertag so when one person goes back

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:10.480
and plays his characters completely gone and apparently band progress is getting

02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:16.320
completely deleted apparently randomly perhaps when the console freezes up and

02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:22.640
just really really poorly about 11 pages on the rock band forms to talk about all

02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:26.800
these problems people have been having and quite unfortunately I kind of don't

02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:31.080
want to play the game until I hear of a patch know what's funny is one thing I

02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:34.600
did do is I signed up on the rock band forms or whatever you can link your

02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:42.600
gamertag to the actual community it's only shown my rock band one stuff I did

02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:45.720
that with you rock then I haven't done that since I've gotten to yet but they

02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:48.280
don't have any of my rock band two stuff on there even though I've been playing

02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:51.880
it online for like a while now it probably takes a while to catch up

02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:55.240
because there's probably like tons and tons and tons of people that are all

02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:57.760
playing this game online right now and that's probably what's causing the

02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:01.000
crashes to is just like you know they're just probably overwhelmed me on one

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.880
hand you ought to think they know how popular their games gonna be but at the

02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:07.960
same time you know you don't really know the strain until you put it out there

02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:11.040
you know what I mean like you can test it test and test all you want but you

02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:15.920
just don't know until it's out there again I'll restate that I only skimmed

02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:20.160
it but I seem to remember that it was limited to local games and not quite

02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:24.280
online in which case the whole comes the whole thing comes up of do people really

02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:28.760
tested and such a narrow instance that they never had these problems when the

02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:31.720
game was being developed it just really shocks me that the scores are just

02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:35.560
resetting because I would think at least a backup copy saved on your local drive

02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:40.080
if nothing else I would imagine the one thing that bugs me more than anything is

02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.280
it is a you know progress and achieving further things in the game I'm already

02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:46.960
kind of turned off just because of the fact that the initial songs are so

02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:50.520
terrible in my opinion you know oh I might lay that about the exercise

02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:55.040
there's a way you can unlock them all right off the bat you know right I don't

02:27:55.040 --> 02:28:00.280
there's no button code out there I don't want to ruin it for everybody but if you

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:03.320
want to search the internet there's a button that you can do on the cheat menu

02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:05.320
that will unlock all the songs automatically

02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:09.760
well here's the thing isn't it not safe your progress when you use enables no

02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:12.360
they disabled it this time it did well here's what it does

02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:16.540
you can use it's the same code as in the first rock band game and what it does on

02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:22.900
the cheat menu is it adds a toggle where you can toggle all songs off or all songs on.

02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:27.980
And if you turn them on then you can't save, but it's more for like parties and that kind

02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:28.980
of thing.

02:28:28.980 --> 02:28:31.540
Right, I was just going to say, that sounds perfect for if I have a bunch of people over

02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:33.900
really want to play and I just throw it in quick play or something.

02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:38.260
Yeah, you can toggle it on and off once you've done it, it'll save that little toggle on

02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:40.500
there and you can turn it on, off, or whatever.

02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.060
It's under the game modifiers section under options.

02:28:44.060 --> 02:28:49.780
So first correction, it was Sephiroth1215, it was an SSJ100 mat, and apparently, I don't

02:28:49.780 --> 02:28:54.420
know if the forum is just overloaded or if they shit-canned this thread or something,

02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:58.860
but I'm getting an error when I tried to browse to it again.

02:28:58.860 --> 02:29:03.360
I posted it in chat in case anybody else was curious, but something tells me nobody else

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:07.380
is going to have any more luck than I am right now.

02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:08.380
So...

02:29:08.380 --> 02:29:13.060
You know, I was trying to load the thread too and I had the same problem, so yeah, something's

02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:14.060
out.

02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:15.060
Lovely.

02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:16.060
Interesting.

02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:19.620
So, alright, well, Jason, hey, we're going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the

02:29:19.620 --> 02:29:20.620
show, alright?

02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:21.620
Alrighty.

02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:22.620
Have a good one, my friend, though.

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:23.620
Hi, guys.

02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:27.340
And hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, before you go, you're a drummer, right?

02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:28.340
You're a drummer, right?

02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:29.340
Primarily, yeah.

02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:33.780
You need to join the band that Shane and I have starting because we need a drummer.

02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:35.340
What are you guys doing?

02:29:35.340 --> 02:29:37.420
We have a band called the Emergency Kittens.

02:29:37.420 --> 02:29:40.180
I'll contact you with more info later.

02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:41.180
Sweet, sounds good.

02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:42.180
Alright, later.

02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:43.180
Thanks.

02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:44.180
Alright.

02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:45.180
Yes, drummer recruited.

02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:50.380
I mean, I could have gone to Bobby Black Wolf, but he said that he's got like a million people

02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:51.380
that he's playing with.

02:29:51.380 --> 02:29:53.820
I'd always play a game with Bobby Black Wolf, too, if he wants to look me up.

02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:55.900
And any drummer, really, that listens to Xbox Live.

02:29:55.900 --> 02:29:57.220
Alright, real quick, one more call.

02:29:57.220 --> 02:29:58.220
Real quick, one more call.

02:29:58.220 --> 02:29:59.220
Who's this?

02:29:59.220 --> 02:30:00.220
This is James Patrick.

02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:01.220
Hey, James Patrick.

02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:02.220
Quick question.

02:30:02.220 --> 02:30:03.220
What's on your mind?

02:30:03.220 --> 02:30:09.020
I haven't been listening to the whole show, but have you guys talked about Monster Hunter

02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:11.660
3 Try, the information that's come out about it?

02:30:11.660 --> 02:30:12.660
We have not.

02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:14.380
Why don't you share that information with our audience?

02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:20.340
Yeah, a bunch of screenshots and stuff from Famitsu has come out recently.

02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:23.700
It's confirmed four player online.

02:30:23.700 --> 02:30:27.260
The city will act as a lobby, apparently.

02:30:27.260 --> 02:30:30.700
It will appear at TGS.

02:30:30.700 --> 02:30:35.500
The engine has been completely rebuilt, apparently, for the first time since like the first Monster

02:30:35.500 --> 02:30:39.100
Hunter game.

02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:43.100
And yeah, it's just a bunch of screenshots out there showing the game and it looks like

02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:47.220
Capcom is actually putting forth a lot of effort into this Wii game.

02:30:47.220 --> 02:30:48.220
It looks pretty.

02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:51.460
What is it that you love so much about Monster Hunter?

02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:55.300
Haven't played it.

02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:56.300
What is it that makes you highly anticipated?

02:30:56.300 --> 02:31:01.980
I know people who've played it and they're very enthusiastic about it, but I think I'll

02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:03.200
try it with this game.

02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:06.340
What makes you so excited about this release?

02:31:06.340 --> 02:31:07.820
Four player online.

02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:12.380
If they use the Wii Speak, I guess that might be the thing that gets me to get Wii Speak.

02:31:12.380 --> 02:31:13.600
Good point.

02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:16.740
Wii Speak has the potential to be pretty cool.

02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:17.740
We'll see.

02:31:17.740 --> 02:31:21.380
It also has the potential to really suck, so I'm very curious to see how that kind of

02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:22.380
plays out.

02:31:22.380 --> 02:31:23.380
Could be very interesting.

02:31:23.380 --> 02:31:28.380
It's got underwater battles as well, and you can go underwater and the monsters can go

02:31:28.380 --> 02:31:32.780
up above and underwater too, apparently, and you can fight in a different environment.

02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:34.660
That sounds like it might be interesting.

02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:35.660
Huh.

02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:36.660
Sounds like it could be a pretty cool game.

02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:40.460
Well, James Patrick, thank you so much for the heads up, and we'll be counting down the

02:31:40.460 --> 02:31:41.460
days to tell this.

02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:44.660
Call us back and let us know how it plays out, because unfortunately, I've got so many

02:31:44.660 --> 02:31:46.820
games I'm playing, I probably won't get around to this one.

02:31:46.820 --> 02:31:48.300
We'll look to you for a review, okay?

02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:49.300
All right.

02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:50.300
All right.

02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:51.300
Have a good one, buddy.

02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:52.300
All right.

02:31:52.300 --> 02:31:54.780
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:56.980
If you didn't get through tonight and still want to talk to us, hey, there's always the

02:31:56.980 --> 02:32:01.620
email bag or our chat room or our MySpace, our Facebook, our live journal, our Twitter.

02:32:01.620 --> 02:32:05.560
There's like a million different ways to find us and interact with us, and you know we love

02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:06.860
reaching out to you guys.

02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:08.260
You guys help us make the show.

02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:09.420
Any more last minute stories, Loki?

02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:10.420
Yes.

02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:13.680
In fact, you would have heard about this early on the Twitter, because I posted it on Twitter

02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:15.380
before the news got out.

02:32:15.380 --> 02:32:20.980
But Kingdom Hearts, chains of, or, Kingdom Hearts RE Chains of Memories is coming to...

02:32:20.980 --> 02:32:24.540
To be fair, you posted it on your personal Twitter and not the OLR Twitter, and folks

02:32:24.540 --> 02:32:26.420
may not know you have your own personal...

02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:27.940
Yeah, whatever.

02:32:27.940 --> 02:32:33.940
Anyways, so it's the remake that of course came out with Kingdom Hearts to Final Mix

02:32:33.940 --> 02:32:40.460
is now coming to the US to PlayStation 2 in December on the 2nd for $29.99.

02:32:40.460 --> 02:32:45.020
So that's not a bad deal, and of course they're adding some new stuff along with that, a brand

02:32:45.020 --> 02:32:50.580
new voice cast, new minigames, but hey, 30 bucks, that's not bad at all, and apparently

02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:54.580
Rockband's down, or Rockband.com's down right now.

02:32:54.580 --> 02:33:01.220
Anyways, some other stuff, and this wasn't on show at all, but I just remembered it.

02:33:01.220 --> 02:33:08.780
You remember last year how they did bundles with the Xbox 360 and you got free games for

02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:10.500
no additional cost.

02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:18.380
Well, they're doing that again this holiday, and I have what games in which consoles.

02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:24.580
The arcade system actually is getting, I don't know if it's that great, but Sega Superstars

02:33:24.580 --> 02:33:33.700
Tennis, and the Elite and Pro systems are both getting two games each, and those would

02:33:33.700 --> 02:33:38.700
be Kung Fu Panda and Lego Indiana Jones.

02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:41.100
So that's not bad for free, for the holidays.

02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:46.420
I guess they're trying to target more of that family audience to fill that hole in their

02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:48.020
demographic there.

02:33:48.020 --> 02:33:51.740
Alright, and let's see here.

02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:57.580
Lastly, I was going to mention that around the time when LittleBigPlanet comes out, they're

02:33:57.580 --> 02:34:02.620
going to be offering some free download content, one of which is a spacesuit, so yes, you can

02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:03.940
be a spaceman as well.

02:34:03.940 --> 02:34:05.700
Is that only for pre-orders or something?

02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:10.740
No, it's just, they're going to offer it for a limited time during the first week when

02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:15.660
it comes out, and also you can get a rare t-shirt in it that says, I was there for week

02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:16.660
one.

02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:21.460
They're both going to be free to download, and the very last thing, this kind of goes

02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:26.980
back to if you're listening live and heard our little funk remixes on there, you too

02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:29.620
can check those out for free.

02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:40.500
They're all free to download off of the guy's website, which is LIDBJORK.HOMELINX.ORG slash

02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:45.620
Nintendo, and the website's called Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo.

02:34:45.620 --> 02:34:57.300
You can also catch them on MySpace dot com slash H-E-N-R-I-K-L-I-D-B-J-O-R-K, and all

02:34:57.300 --> 02:34:58.300
those are free to download.

02:34:58.300 --> 02:34:59.300
B-J-O-R-K?

02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:00.300
Bjork?

02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:01.300
Bjork, yes.

02:35:01.300 --> 02:35:02.300
Yeah, LIDBJORK.

02:35:02.300 --> 02:35:03.300
Nice.

02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:05.940
And those are all free to download.

02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:11.940
He has Nintenseploitation, and then there's another album, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo,

02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:17.460
which when I was playing one of those AUG files, it crashed my computer, so I stopped

02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:18.460
playing those.

02:35:18.460 --> 02:35:22.100
But the first album that he has, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo, is a lot of Mega Man stuff,

02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:28.060
and some of the other games he remixes, Disney's DuckTales, there's a few tracks on there from

02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:34.140
that, and Gunsmoke, and of course, oh there's one from Maniac Mansion, that's kind of cool.

02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:35.780
Alright, very cool.

02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:39.580
Some of them are good, some of them are alright.

02:35:39.580 --> 02:35:47.740
There was one from Mario Brothers, or something that's kind of weird, or Link's Got a Bop

02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:50.340
Gun, that was kind of a weird one.

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:52.420
Alright, that's it.

02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:53.420
Awesome, awesome.

02:35:53.420 --> 02:35:56.920
Well, DarkSakura, I'd ask if you have any last minute stories, but I know your voice

02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:58.740
is not doing too hot.

02:35:58.740 --> 02:35:59.740
No.

02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:02.300
So, well, I hope you feel better.

02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:07.860
In the meantime, I hope the allergies die down, and stop scratching at your throat,

02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:10.820
because that's very rude when you're a radio person, to do that.

02:36:10.820 --> 02:36:14.340
It feels like an undead bird crawled into my throat and made a nest.

02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:15.340
You, you.

02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:16.340
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:20.140
Alright, well I will ask for one more thing from you tonight, and that is, your final

02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:21.140
thought.

02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:23.380
Oh, that one's really easy.

02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:26.380
You know what it is?

02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:31.380
Dying of fire, immediately.

02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:33.940
Loki, your final thought.

02:36:33.940 --> 02:36:39.780
My final thought is the Baskin-Robbins, I guess their Heath Shake, has 2300 calories

02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:40.780
in it.

02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:44.060
Thank God I don't like Heath bars.

02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:48.260
My final thought is Frozen Yogurt sounds really awesome right now.

02:36:48.260 --> 02:36:49.260
That's what I want.

02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:51.260
I really want Frozen Yogurt right now.

02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:54.660
Hey, thank you guys so much for, unfortunately the Frozen Yogurt place closes at 9, and it's

02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:55.660
now 9.05.

02:36:55.660 --> 02:37:00.780
Thank you guys for staying up and listening to us tonight, and supporting Independent

02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:01.780
Radio.

02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:04.900
If you like what you heard, tell two friends about our show.

02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:05.900
That's how we spread the word.

02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:08.300
It's all via word of mouth, you guys.

02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:09.300
Really appreciate it.

02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:11.500
Or you could leave us a five-star review on iTunes.

02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:13.140
We've had a few people do that this week.

02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:16.880
Thank you guys so much to the new five-star reviews we've had left on iTunes.

02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:17.880
Really appreciate it.

02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:20.580
Cheeseburger messaged me with dongle.

02:37:20.580 --> 02:37:23.860
Yeah, I saw dongle show up on Twitter.

02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:24.860
Dongle.

02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:31.060
Let's see, we had Mozart FX left a nice five-star review, and Skylark91 left a nice one, Warrior

02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:32.060
Bob a few days ago.

02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:33.060
They did the crappy review.

02:37:33.060 --> 02:37:34.060
We call you out.

02:37:34.060 --> 02:37:37.140
Dan Shadow, who emailed us, left a nice five-star review not that long ago, so thank you guys

02:37:37.140 --> 02:37:39.780
so much who have left the nice reviews for us on iTunes.

02:37:39.780 --> 02:37:41.140
Every little bit helps.

02:37:41.140 --> 02:37:42.140
We really appreciate it.

02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:43.140
Spread the word.

02:37:43.140 --> 02:37:44.940
Have we got any one-star reviews on there?

02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:48.700
If we did, I would not acknowledge them on this program, because we don't want to encourage

02:37:48.700 --> 02:37:52.620
more people to do it, because actually one-star reviews really hurt.

02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:56.220
Look, if you want to give the show a one-star review, don't do that.

02:37:56.220 --> 02:37:59.420
Go give a show you like more a five-star review.

02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:00.540
It's much more impactful.

02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:04.260
Go help a show you do like then, because it's just kind of rude to leave a one-star review

02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:05.260
in my opinion.

02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:06.260
All right.

02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:07.260
That's it.

02:38:07.260 --> 02:38:08.260
We're out of here.

02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:09.260
Have a good night, everybody.

02:38:09.260 --> 02:38:13.460
We'll see you next week with episode 296 of Orange Lounge Radio as we inch closer to that

02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:14.460
big 300 mark.

02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:15.460
Yikes.

02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:16.460

Sunday nights at 6 p.m.

02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:36.180
Pacific time, the views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily

02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:42.660
reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably

02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:43.660
right anyway.

02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:52.220
See you next week.
