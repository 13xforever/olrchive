We take some time to decompress after Penny Arcade Expo, Luminous makes its way to yet another platform, and could a new Kingdom Hearts game be showing at Tokyo Game Show?
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
She's replaced him with Rob's laundry Yes
No, just kidding, of course.
He's away at a thing for his day job today that he had to go to, so he won't be here tonight.
But he'll be back next week, as we all will.
And we have no guests tonight either.
It's just the lovely DarkSakura, myself, feeling the love with all you kids from our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
And we have some stuff there in chat.
Gsquared68 says, Orange Laundry Mower Radio.
I tried to get Dan to come tonight.
Yeah?
What was his excuse?
He had to work.
Aw, bummer.
Stupid job!
Weren't you telling me that Dan, gosh, he so, so just worked and worn out.
He was playing Street Fighter IV this week or something?
It was at the Game Crazy Manager Conference.
They either had it there or he went to an arcade that had one, but he played Street Fighter IV and said that it was pretty good, but the jumping was weird.
Hmm.
It looks very slick from what I've seen.
I'm looking forward to getting my hands on it.
Nice.
Very excited.
Of course, that's not the one I'm excited about.
What are you excited about?
Freakin' Capcom vs. Tatsunoko I had a feeling Any particular reason?
Gatchaman!
Well, yeah, Gatchaman And Dan was like, it doesn't have Joe in it I was like, but it has Ken, and it has Hurricane Polymer And Kashan, so it's all cool Alright, very nice And Techamon Gsquared68 is also mentioning in our chatroom San Jose State has it, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump from us So maybe we have to take a road trip at some point
That would be cool.
That would be fun.
A little OLR road trip as if Seattle wasn't fun enough.
Speaking of Seattle, Penny Arcade Expo.
Unfortunately, we did not get to do our own show just due to some technical difficulties, but we contributed to... Shut up.
No, no, no, no, no.
Due to... I'm going to come clean on this one.
Due to when we were going to be doing a show, Jamie instead passed out.
I had technical difficulties with my ability to stay awake.
You know what, Rob?
Yeah.
It was fantastic.
And some Bobby bonding as well.
And some hatred of the Western Internet.
Yes, the Western Internet was sucky.
And some bonding with our listeners.
We had just a wonderful turnout.
Such an experience with that superglue and duct tape, I swear.
BlackWolf is clarifying in chat there was no bondage
I don't know where that came from.
I think some of our chatters are going there.
I just said bonding.
I meant literally, you know.
Bonding.
It was that episode.
No, I'm just kidding.
Anyhow.
Alright, so how was your Penny Arcade Expo, DarkSakura?
I know we usually start with how was your gaming week, but seeing as Penny Arcade Expo was such a... We'll get to gaming week post-packs later.
How was your Penny Arcade Expo?
What kind of stuff did you see at the show that you enjoyed?
Walk us through your time at Penny Arcade Expo a little bit.
Well, I was in a daze, you know, that Friday, because I was just all like, pretty, shiny, Namco, hang out with Namco for an hour, you know, and they were just selling stuff, but I was like, dude, I don't care, because it's Namco, and I wanted a Dig Dug plushie and couldn't get one.
Did you miss the memo that Namco hates us?
Katamari, remember that?
Ah, forget it.
So... I'm kidding.
I love Namco!
I really, really like LittleBigPlanet.
I thought that was pretty cool.
I liked what I saw of Spore.
We're probably gonna get it eventually.
I don't really have much time to play it, so it's whenever Dan gets it.
I actually liked Wii Music.
because I thought that it was just neat.
I thought that, you know, and I like... I'm one of those people who likes finding, you know, MIDI programs and then redoing all the instruments in the MIDI to sound completely bizarre.
So that's actually one of the things that I liked about Wii Music is that it just had that playing with MIDI tones type of thing to it.
Animal Crossing, it was...
Animal Crossing, and I really liked the Wario game.
That one was kind of cool.
And I went over to hang out with, okay, was it EA?
No, it wasn't EA.
EA had some of the crap.
Just so you know, Bobby just disowned you because you like Wii music.
I didn't say that I was going to play it.
I just thought it was neat.
This comes from my old, what was my third major?
Music major, right?
I'm on major number 12 now.
I would be all over Wii Music if I was 12.
Yeah, I thought it was neat.
It would be something that would be fun to waste some time with, I thought.
At any rate.
I gotta say this.
Black Wolf just said, I liked and Wii Music do not belong in the same sentence, unless in the context of, I liked to hate on Wii Music.
I think we said this in an earlier show when we first talked about Wii Music.
If it gets kids into real music, it's a good thing, regardless.
That's what I think.
It's a great platform into learning a bit more.
Because really, it teaches tempo.
It teaches a little bit of arrangement.
I thought it's a neat little concept.
I would have totally loved to have something like this when I was little.
I played Mario Paint.
You know?
MarioPaint
Sushi Bumper Sumo Fun Game
And as I was saying earlier when Bobby called in, you play as a sushi plate and you have to keep the other piece of sushi away from the others.
And they can knock you into the conveyor belt and you lose a piece of sushi.
And whoever holds on to the sushi for the longest time within two minutes gets a higher score and wins.
Basically, keep away with sushi.
And...
It was a really fun, weird little game.
And from what I understand, it's supposed to be coming out on an Xbox Live Arcade, so I'm looking forward to that.
I really, really wish I had earplugs for all the people who couldn't sing that were playing Rock Band and Guitar Hero.
Because, I mean, you've got a bar telling you when you're out of tune, you should actually pay attention to it.
I'm sorry, I don't know if I've said so before on the show, but I hear perfect pitch, which drove me nuts in band, but I really can't filter out.
That's why I don't like to sing in front of people because I can hear it in myself.
That's why I don't sing.
At any rate, other stuff that I saw that was really cool was Pink Godzilla because I bought stuff from Pink Godzilla.
For anyone who doesn't know, my anniversary was on the 1st.
Dan and I have been married for three years and I bought him his anniversary present from Pink Godzilla.
I got him a salamander pack for PSP.
That's nerd love right there.
That is nerd love.
Well, he got me an iPod that he got for free.
He re-gifted for your anniversary?
That's fine.
I don't care.
At least it's an iPod.
Yeah, it's little in red and it says the GameStop Special Edition or some shit on it.
But anyway, other fun stuff.
I liked hanging out with the Commander 3 people.
They were kind of cool.
Actually, they were really cool.
And I actually went to talk to some of the digital design students.
Dork.
You can't do this in Wii Music, but you can do it in Mario Paint.
That's actually a pretty decent little arrangement.
Where's my bucket so I can roll it at you?
Sorry, couldn't resist.
Anyway.
Wii Music will never have the greatness of the Mario Paint.
Mario Paint was fantastic.
We need Mario Paint the sequel.
We need Mario Paint 2 Electric Boogaloo.
Other stuff that I saw slash played or did, yeah, I was mentioning, I was talking to a lot of the digital design schools that try to get people to sign up for their schools.
They really actually got a lot of good tips for myself as far as things to study in my current major.
I mean, they were all like, we'd prefer you to go to our school, but there's a few of them that were actually beginning transfer programs I was kind of looking into.
There's one in Sunnyvale, and that would just be really cool because then I'd be close to Capcom's testing grounds, and that would be sweet.
um also um trying out all the fun restaurants going to Gameworks which was oddly disappointing because I couldn't win that Tales out of the Crane game and there was an incredible incredible lack of Planet Harriers so I wanted to cry and sob tears of you know of disappointment for having no Planet Harrier because Planet Harrier is one of the greatest arcade games ever ever are
Um, what?
Rob's looking like he's up to something, everybody.
No, they just wanted to link to the YouTube and chat.
So I just put it in there in true Mario Paint Roll fashion.
I put, dude, this YouTube is so cool, and then put the link.
So we'll see how many people click.
Dork.
Well, I also played, actually I was very surprised about how much I liked it.
I played the Ninja Gaiden demo on DS, and it was really, really cool, but there was another DS demo that actually was really freaking fun, and that was the Arkanoid demo.
I used to play Arkanoid back in the day on the old, you know, Game Brick, the old Game Boy, and that was pretty fun.
And I saw people playing a WonderSwan, and I wished I had brought my WonderSwan.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
TurboGrafx Duo Laptop
which had its own little screen and everything.
Really freaking expensive.
And so I saw someone who had one.
And then I got to meet my musical hero, Jonathan Coulton.
And I got to meet my geek hero, Wil Wheaton.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
It was just really fun.
There were the free game panels, there were movies, there were performances.
This wasn't like E3.
This was a freaking convention.
That's what this was.
E3 is a media spectacle, I should say.
PAX is like an anime con, but just video games.
I would like to say to all of you folks that went to Penny Arcade Expo, I'm quite proud of the majority of you for knowing how to bathe properly.
I know!
It was actually a pretty pleasant smelling, I mean, don't get me wrong, there were a few people that smelled like fart, but some people, the most people It's the gym sock syndrome, you can tell who's been sleeping in the lounge.
Most people were very well bathed, and I appreciate it.
And all the all games people were well, well bathed, so thank you all.
I really, I just really had a good time.
You know what, it felt a lot... Except for DMN.
Dirty bastard.
It felt a lot like going to Faname.
Is that the impression that you got?
Kinda, but it was all games, so I felt like I understood it.
I felt like it was... As opposed to Faname.
And on top of that, I thought that it was very well organized as far as getting into some of the events, even though I didn't go to the one event I wanted to go to.
Well, that and the Nerdcore Rising.
I got to see MC Frontalot, but I didn't buy anything from him.
Oh, well.
Anyway, but it was just really, I thought, well-organized in how they had everything together.
And it gave everybody a fair opportunity.
So that was even what impressed me a whole lot more.
That and there was some cosplay.
Oh, my God.
It was very convention-like.
Except there was some really shitty cosplay.
And whoever that was who cosplayed the bride who wasn't wearing underwear...
You need to eat a steak, girl.
I'm sorry.
When you can see someone's pelvic bones, their hips, no, that's a sign that somebody needs to freaking sit down with a porterhouse and chow down.
Sorry, and nobody wants to see your ass.
Thank you.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura.com
has the potential to be neat or really really stale and right now it's feeling a little stale so I just really hope the internet functionality is built in there the way we're all dreaming of because that's going to be what saves this game the Wario Land game was great too but you know obviously that's something we've kind of already seen here in studio if you've been paying attention in the last few episodes as far as other stuff that Jamie didn't talk about because I don't think it's quite up her alley Warhammer Online I got to check out a little bit they had a booth set up there and
I forgot my name
To me, which isn't a bad thing.
WoW is a great formula.
And, you know, it has slightly nicer graphics and it, you know, kind of tracks your quests a little differently.
And of course, naturally, you have different classes, different races.
So it's not the exact same as WoW.
But I just would have liked to have seen a little more on the floor.
I understand they showed some of this in panels, but, you know, those were impossible to get into without waiting forever.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
LittleBigPlanet, loved it, loved it.
Game of the show for me, honestly.
I was very surprised at just really how good Sony's booth was, all things considered.
I actually thought the games Sony was showing was probably better than the stuff Nintendo was showing on a whole.
Sinkstar looked fun, I didn't get a chance to play it though
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I played Katana, she played Catwoman.
Oh yeah, that's right, we did play that.
It was fun!
It was kind of fun.
You know, I said this when I was kind of trying to summarize the show in my live journal.
It's never going to be as great as Marvel vs. Capcom.
You know, and Mortal Kombat has always been a little bit of a, I don't know, not so serious, at least to me, especially like in any Mortal Kombat game since like 2.0.
It's not like a real hardcore fighting game.
It's more of a game that seems to not take itself so seriously, at least in my mind.
You know what I mean?
And I think the trend continues here with DC Universe.
You really are just kind of taking out Mortal Kombat characters and putting in DC Universe characters instead, but it's the same engine.
I don't think it's a game anyone's going to remember years from now or lavish praise on, but was it a lot of big dumb fun?
Yeah!
Yeah!
D&D 4th Edition D&D 4th Edition D&D 4th Edition
and then let's see there's another game at PAX Puzzle Quest Galactrix I'll say really quickly I got to play a little bit of they had that playable on the show floor and you just have to really think it's not like Bejeweled anymore I mean it is but now it's on a hexagon which completely changes the way you have to think about the game but I enjoy myself with that game I just hope it's not too I mean that well I'm kind of thinking you know I hope it's not too much of the same
But they really did try to mix it up with putting it on the hexagon and kind of giving it the space theme.
I think it'll be kind of cool.
I was very disappointed, though, that they were showing a trailer for Star Trek Online on the floor, but not any actual gameplay.
That didn't make me disappointed.
That made my heart hurt because I'm totally going to play that.
Yeah, me too.
I was hoping to see a little more on that.
But I understand.
It's early.
It's early.
I'm not hating.
It's just, you know, it got my hopes up only to be crushed by disappointment.
And one more game I'll mention.
Iron Chef America is crap
I think it'll be a lot of big dumb fun.
I did like how you could garnish your plate.
That was kind of fun.
I like that.
Well, I guess part of it is presentation.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was cool.
I'm looking at comments from chat.
TheRobD says, Iron Mama, in a way.
Let's see.
I'm looking at other comments from chat here.
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to add some things to the chat.
and I can't say this name, K-H-A-S-N, Kassen.
I don't know if that's how you say it.
The game looks bad.
The graphics aren't stellar, but it is on the Wii, which doesn't really do the high def stuff so well.
A game is only... Play it first.
A game with crappy graphics can still be fun.
Look at the old Atari 2600 games.
Unless it's E.T.
Again, it's not going to be anything you're going to remember for a lifetime, but for $20, it's a good waste of time.
So, I guess that's all I really want to say about PAX.
How was your gaming week?
I'll talk some more about the whole PAX broadcast and all that in just a little bit when we get to housekeeping.
I do want to say, though, how was your gaming week after PAX?
Did you play anything post-PAX that you want to talk about?
Well, Ragnarok.
And I played a stellar game of Black Knight 2000 Pinball.
For the record, we are selling our Black Knight 2000 Pinball.
Oh, are you disappointed about that, or is it time?
We want one with a better playfield.
Oh, okay.
We're also selling our Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball.
because, again, we want a better table.
All right.
Well, as long as you're going to get it back because I love Next Generation.
And any listener who is willing to trade across the board, we will trade our creature from the Black Lagoon for a Lord of the Rings pinball, please.
I'm making a mention on behalf of my husband because I really don't care for a creature from the Black Lagoon anyway.
um but no um i uh i did play uh a lot of uh i actually did play a lot of uh um solitaire just because i have that kind of time which is not really so
That's about it.
I'm in school, so it's not like I have time to really do a lot of playing.
That's cool.
I played a lot of Rock Band and Guitar Hero this week.
I went back to kind of milk the last little bit out of those games that I'm going to before the new sequels come out because we're only a few days away from Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band 2 coming out, so I'm just kind of squeezing the last little bit out of those games because, yeah, I plan to export the Rock Band tracks and then get rid of the game.
I mean, even if I only get a few bucks for it, I'll take it.
because I don't really plan to play it much longer.
But I'll tell you what bugs me about Rock Band.
You freaking people that play online matches like in score battle or what have you and then when I'm beating you and I'm about to win the song with like 20,000 points over you, you freaking quit so I don't get credit for the song.
I hate that.
I have been leaving negative feedback though on people that do that because that pisses me off and I encourage people to do that.
Don't forget like if people quit early because they can't suck it up that someone beat them at the game, freaking leave them a negative review so it does affect their little score because I think that is such bull crap and the rock band should,
I did actually have another edition of my gaming week.
I received a game.
My wonderful husband has finally brought me home.
The world ends with you, so I'm going to be playing that.
Oh, cool.
Finally!
When you beat that, I want to borrow it.
I'm going to go and check that out.
You will be first in line.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There you go.
This person sucks ass.
Yeah, sadly you can't filter down that good, but you can leave the reason why you're putting them on your frown list.
There's a smile list and a frown list.
And if you want to mark their frown because they quit early, you can do that.
And so I've done that for you rock band fools.
I'm going to start reading names on the show of gamer tags that have quit out on me.
Do it.
In fact, I'll look up the name while you're reading the next story and call them out here on the program.
That'll be fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Go ahead.
What?
Xbox Live Arcade.
I checked out Gin Rummy.
The presentation of that game is actually really nice.
I just wish there was more to it than just Gin Rummy.
Because I think there's... Sierra, our masters, are doing card games on the computer and such.
So it's kind of nice to see them getting into it on Xbox Live Arcade.
I just wish there had been a little more to it.
And I just didn't feel like the price justified it.
Because I know this sounds harsh, but I could get a real deck of cards.
Then again...
I can say the same thing about Uno, but yet Uno is so much fun on Xbox Live.
I can't explain what it is, the difference.
Maybe, I don't know, maybe it's the fact more people are on Uno or that Uno is so disgustingly simple and you can literally just sit down and play for five minutes and Rummy takes a little more time.
I don't know.
How about rock band stuff?
How about Rock Band stuff?
There is actually a Rock Band 2 track list that is ranked by difficulty for Xbox 360.
Hold on, hold on, we're not in story chat.
Hold on, sorry.
No, no, no, no.
I don't know why I'm... I gotta get to housekeeping.
You know what, I thought that you had read your story and I completely blanked, so I'm sorry.
Because we're starting with a Rock Band story tonight.
That's okay.
Because I thought that you...
That's alright, I'm done with my gaming week.
Let's do housekeeping and then we can talk about Rock Band, okay?
Can I go crawl under the couch now?
No, you're fine, you're fine.
Housekeeping tonight.
I wanted to mention of Penny Arcade coverage.
The seven hours, eight hours worth of stuff we did at Penny Arcade Expo is up.
It was really Bobby that did it all because he was there the whole time.
But we, at least I, pretty much was there all day Friday and all day Saturday.
DarkSakura and Loki spent pretty much all their time there too.
So check that out.
PAX...
.allgames.com is there and that's where you can actually get now some video is being posted as well of the interviews that Bobby did.
He actually has some interviews and I think I showed up in the first one.
I asked a question of the JumpGate Evolution guy.
So it's there and you can download it and it's neat.
Bobby did a very good job with the videos.
I was very happy.
E4ALL is the next expo on the radar and sadly all three of us are not going to be going to E4ALL but I am.
I'm going to go for E4ALL to represent Orange Launch Radio and I know a lot of folks might be thinking why
E4ALL does not appear to be having the big exhibitor list of other conventions and to me I actually think that's kind of the charm of it I want to go and promote Orange Lounge Radio to the gamers that will show up and from what I hear All Games is going to have a heck of a booth there their theme has to do with classic games I'm not sure how much I can and can't say about the booth but from what I've heard it's going to be a good time so if you're in the LA area you should come out and check us out at E4ALL I will be there also best for last
OLRPSP.com
DarkSakura.com
or heck, if you want to tune in to some of the other programming, tune in at 4.45pm Pacific Sunday night.
Go on your PSP to the Orange Lounge Radio All Games listener and you go right to All Games Radio and listen to everything.
It's great.
Check it out.
I can say how great it is without sounding like I have an ego because Loki did it all.
He really did a great job, not just for us representing Orange Lounge Radio but for representing allgames.com.
Plus he let out a series of colorful expletives while he was working on it, and that was pretty funny.
Yes, it was funny to watch, so good times.
So check that out, olrpsp.com.
Also, we're trying something new tonight.
OhChat28 is giving an endorsement.
It says the PSP All Games Radio is pretty damn cool.
Tonight we're trying something new.
Since it is just DarkSakura and myself here in studio, our Skype line is going to be open all night.
We're going to take calls as we get them tonight.
We're trying something new.
If you feel at any time you want to call in and give us a call, comment on what's going on.
1-877-GAME-OLR
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
which you know Gabe and Tycho at Penny Arcade they love that and the other cool thing the performers in the PAX pack were actually people that were at Penny Arcade Expo so even if you were not there live at the show it's kind of like you could have PAX in your house a little bit
And you can play along to Skullcrusher Mountain by Jonathan Colton, which you gotta love that here at Orange Lounge Radio.
We've talked about that before.
Livin' on the Corner of Dude and Catastrophe by MC Frontalot and Shhh by Darkest of the Hillside Thickets.
Three bucks.
Shhh, by the way, is a previously unreleased track.
The other two songs have been released before and they are all master recordings.
So if you have Rock Band and you want to feel good about donating to Child's Play and get some music at the same time, there you have it.
Rock Band Packs Pack.
I'm going to do my story now.
So, gee, DarkSakura, do you have anything you want to share with us by chance?
Oh, stop making fun of me, okay?
Can't resist.
It's my job.
Infinite Undiscovery has an ad on this.
No, I'm just kidding.
Oh, yeah, that was pretty, too.
I forgot to mention Infinite Undiscovery.
I bought it, and I played it for an hour, and I was extremely disappointed.
Compared to what I played at PAX I thought at PAX I had a good time at PAX But I really hated the opening of this game I think God, the whole ogre chase thing Is not a way to start the game That was a horrible idea And it really just made me disinterested almost in the whole thing It doesn't suck how like one poorly planned level Can just ruin an entire game I'm gonna try and stick it out and try to get to some of the parts I saw at Penny Arcade Expo But I was not happy with Infinite and Discovery Anyhow, sorry, go ahead
All right, well, the song list that I mentioned before in order of difficulty is for Rock Band 2, sorry, is Eye of the Tiger, Float On, Today Hungry Like the Wolf, Cool for Cats, Pretend We're Dead.
I love that song.
My Own Worst Enemy, One Step Closer, We Got the Beat, That's What You Get, Rebel... Wait, this is guitar difficulty, right?
Rebel Girl, So What You Want, Drain You, New Kid in School, Hello There, Lump, American Woman, Mountain Song, Man in the Box, R-Truth, White Wedding, E-Pro, Solid, Psycho Killer,
Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.
I meant Solid is the third stage.
So, Psycho Killer, Spirit in the Sky, Kids in America, Feel the Pain.
Oh, that's a good song, too.
Give It Away, Conventional Lover, A Jagged Gorgeous Winter, Bad Reputation, Pump It Up, You Oughta Know, Go Your Own Way, Welcome to the Neighborhood, and then Moderate is PDA, Shooting Star, Living on a Prayer, Deluxe, Girls Not Gray, One Way or Another, Tangled Up in Blue, Alex Chilton, Alive, The Middle, Aqualung,
Dude, Aqualung, cool.
Supreme Girl.
Challenging, we have Down with the Sickness, Give It All, Where'd You Go, Come Out and Play, Everlong, Pinball Wizard, that's also really cool, Rob the President, Testify, Uncontrollable Urge, Any Way You Want It, Round and Round, Night Lies, and then, what?
I was just going to say, thank you, Harmonix, for the journey.
I love you.
Nightmare Level, now I'm thinking of Doom, you know, was the last one, hurt me plenty.
Anyway.
But I don't want to die.
Let There Be Rock, Alabama Getaway, Lazy Eye, Teenage Riot, The Trees, Vault Edition, Carry On, Wayward Son, Rockin' Me, Ace of Spades 08.
I somehow missed that Carry On My Wayward Son is in that game.
That is awesome.
I'm sorry.
This is good.
I'm actually glad you're reading the whole list because I forgot about how some of these songs are in Rock Band 2.
It's going to be pretty awesome.
Yeah, that's why I just said to do the whole thing.
Spoon Man makes me happy.
You know, before Chris Cornell damaged his voice and doesn't sound as awesome as he used to.
Almost Easy, Chop Suey, Shacklers, Revenge, and then Impossible Mode is Master Exploder, Ramblin' Man, Shoulder to the Plow, Get Clean,
Colony of Birchmen, Peace Cells, Souls of Black, Battery, Panic Attack, Visions, Painkiller.
So, there you go.
Now see, the only bummer is that a lot of the songs I really want to play are not in the difficult category.
But that's okay, you know, I understand.
Because they want the difficult songs to be the more guitar, metal stuff that I don't really listen to usually.
But man, as a whole...
Master Exploder Master Exploder Master Exploder
I'm curious what you guys think about the Rock Band 2 song list and the difficulties.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Laundry.
I'm kind of curious if people are actually going to call or if everybody's going to wait until the end like usual.
That's why this is an experiment tonight.
More Rock Band.
I mean, we just have a crap load of music game news tonight, especially, you know, as we're on the brink of a Rock Band 2 being released.
Lots and lots of music game news tonight.
And the details are finally out for how you are going to get your Rock Band 1 songs into Rock Band 2.
It is available to happen now.
Even though Rock Band 2 is not technically out yet, you can start the exporting process.
The whole process takes about 10 minutes, and it'll set you back $5, and it'll allow you to take 55 songs, take them out of Rock Band 1, and put them into Rock Band 2.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and anything you've downloaded from before so that's that's gonna be a heck of a song list even though you know a lot of you have already played but that's neat I'm looking forward to that uh it is a bummer that they have to recharge you for that but I guess that's a licensing thing and there's just no way around it and admittedly five dollars not too bad not too bad
I got to do that quickly before Rock Band 2 comes out because you know there's going to be tons of people that are ripping the songs and then sell the game back.
I hope the game doesn't pull a gotcha and at some point you have to insert the original Rock Band disc or else we'll be screwed.
How about some Guitar Hero World Tour news?
This makes me happy because I'm a fangirl.
The latest who's going to be in the game as a playable character is Sting.
That makes me very, very happy because I was a big Police fan.
They're also supposed to be recreating Jimi Hendrix, Ozzy Osbourne, Zach Wilde, and Billy Corgan.
So that's pretty cool.
But you just have to find out, I guess, if anyone else is going to be in Guitar Hero World Tour when it comes out.
Yeah.
Guitar Hero Gorillaz Edition
I don't believe so.
I could be wrong, but I don't believe so.
We've had Radiohead.
I'm sure Chatwell will correct us if we're wrong.
Yeah.
I would love to see a Gorillaz edition.
Yeah.
You know what's pretty rad is that in Rock Band 1, when you're playing online, you get a random song that you play against your opponent with, which I wish Guitar Hero did so that way everybody didn't pick Through the Fire and the Flames.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Betelbum is in Rock Band
I like that song.
Honestly, if I was gonna... Girls and Boys, hello.
No, no, no.
For just the guitar in it, because I'm sorry, even though he had to be an ass.
Graham Coxon is one of the, I would have to say, best guitar players out there, and I would love to have had Charmless Man in there.
Because the guitar in that would be really fun.
Bobby's in chat saying, I want to play Rock Band with Rob, and I also want to play Civ Rev with Rob.
Bring it!
Sivrev, Matthew Sweet
And this actually is a little bit older news, it came up last week, but Penny Arcade Expo was kind of distracting us Matthew Sweet is actually considering that he's going to be doing a lawsuit against Guitar Hero 2 He says, quote, I've been trying to see if I can get a lawsuit against them because they never asked to use the song A lot of kids have gotten into his music because of the inclusion of the song in the game Quote, I found out that the Romantics have a lawsuit going against the makers of that game because of the song What I Like About You
He says, I don't know if the Romantics are going to win their suit, but it's really weird.
I've never sued anyone in my life, and I don't think it would amount to much anyway.
So he's thinking about actually, even though he kind of admits more people get into the music, he wants to sue the people that did Guitar Hero for putting a song in there.
Although it was probably his record label that signed it away.
Doesn't make sense.
And honestly though, because I was actually, I don't know if you remembered, I was really surprised to see Matthew Sweet songs in there.
Because I've actually been a fan of Matthew Sweet since I was in high school.
Ever since...
No, I take that back.
Ever since college, because he did a couple of videos, one of them for a girlfriend that had clips from Cobra in it.
He's a big anime fan.
That's how I found out.
And also one with lots of Urasayatsura clips in the video.
I've been waiting.
That was the other one.
and on top of that I've been I picked up quite a number of his albums because I have my favorite album that he did is Altered Beast and he did one called Son of Altered Beast that has some of my favorite songs there so to hear that he's wanting to sue a video game company for promoting his music because I thought that me and five other people liked him that's just sort of ridiculous I think
Yeah, I mean, you can be a fan of someone and still admit, you know, smack, what are you thinking?
You know, right?
Like, if one of my favorite musicians was doing this, I would say, you know, I like you, but what are you thinking, dude?
And Ranma, yes, it was Space Adventure Cobra.
It was a lot of clips from the super uber long movie version.
Frisbee says sue someone.
It's the American way.
But here's the weird thing.
You know, Matthew Sweet references the romantics thing, but that was actually thrown out of court.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You suing Guitar Hero will go over about as well as when Metallica sued Napster.
You can actually kind of understand why Metallica sued Napster.
But in this case, why so upset?
It gets more people into your music and so on.
Is he just upset he's not getting more money out of the whole thing?
If you sell CDs because of it, what's the big fucking deal?
Well, now we've spawned a whole Takahashi anime thing in chat because I happen to mention Urasayatsura.
And also, I think that Fire Tripper is a little better than some of those if you have to go for individual stuff.
The end.
By the way, that interview is from the North County Times.
If you want to check that out for yourself, nctimes.com did the interview on August 21st.
which was when we weren't here.
Hopefully he snaps out of it and doesn't end up suing the game because I think that would be a little silly and is just going to get a more negative publicity amongst the people playing this game than positive.
I think if he has issues with it, he needs to take it up with his record company or whoever signed on the dotted line and licensed this song away.
That is the person he needs to be going after if he doesn't want this to happen in the future, in my opinion.
Well, your opinion counts because you are an internet celebrity.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
What?
I don't know if I'd say that, but okay, I'll take it.
Oh, come on, the internet is serious business!
Anyway, for something that... There is quite a bit of classic rock fans still left in the world.
I'm one, definitely.
But there are some classic acts that are going to be re-recording some master tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour.
Some of these are actually in...
I'd have to say MC5's Kick Out the Jams is going to be one.
They're actually having some help from Alice in Chains member Jerry Cantrell and Guns N' Roses' Gilby Clark.
Sex Pistols is putting up Pretty Vacant and Motorhead re-recorded Overkill.
I like Motorhead, by the way.
So I think that's pretty neat.
There also, though, was apparently a little bit of trouble with some of the tracks they were wanting to put in, so they're all working on trying to get the bugs ironed out.
Hmm.
Could be interesting.
I think so.
We'll see what happens with that.
Now, we've been talking a lot about music games, but let's not forget the music game that started it all, at least for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
Dance Dance Revolution is still trucking along, and Hottest Party 2 and DDRX have gotten some more song announcements this week about some of the songs that you're going to find in the game.
Dance Dice Revolution Hottest Party 2 it's completely made up of covers but actually now there's also going to be some Konami originals in the game and those were some of the songs they announced this week for example we have Desert Journey by DJ Taka a new song that's going to show up in the game Terra, Kyoka Suigetsu Rou is coming out and if you want to look at the full list yourself ddronlinecommunity.com if you want to see some of the other songs that are going to be in the game
I do want to also mention the songs that are coming to DDRX on the PlayStation 2.
Some new licensed songs.
I thought this was interesting.
Naropa is coming back and the reason why that's interesting is because they're one of the different drum artists.
So now you have the different drum songs going on to PlayStation 2.
Feel is the song by Naropa that you're going to see in DDRX.
Some more new edits.
of old classic DDR songs.
Remember Butterfly and Dubby Dub were getting recut and re-edited for DDRX.
I don't know if you heard about that.
Some other songs got announced.
Hero is coming.
You know, remember?
La-da-dee-da-da.
You are my hero.
But no, get this.
Get Up and Move is also getting a new edit.
Remember S&K?
Get Up and Move.
That wasn't a good song.
Petshot Boys
Open from the Dub Pistols, synthesized from the punk label Fat Wreck Chords, the artist The Apixies was synthesized.
So it looks like a variety of music.
You have synth pop, punk, and bad music.
All different genres.
I'm just kidding.
Something for everyone in DDRX, it sounds like.
The bottom of the barrel of the Konami originals.
Yeah, exactly.
I'm trying to see if there's comments from chat.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Some people are yelling out, get up and move.
Frisbee's remembering there was a sweet freestyle to it.
I bet there was some pretty awesome freestyle to that song, though, actually.
I've seen awesome freestyle done to really crappy songs, so...
Frisbee also says that they need to do the R21 patch for DDRX Arcade.
You know, I'm not thinking that's actually going to happen.
Needs more 2 Unlimited.
How about no?
2 Unlimited is like the quintessential jock jams band.
I guess.
We're in the Twilight Zone
Viva Pinata, Pocket Paradise, The Price is Right, The Game, Ubisoft
That makes you happy, doesn't it?
But it's not Bob Barker, is it?
Yeah, I don't know.
Some things just don't need to be made into games.
They need to do classic Price is Right for you.
Also that does not need to be made into games, Hell's Kitchen is coming out on the Wii along with the Price is Right port on the Wii.
And Hell's Kitchen also making its way to the DS shows just how easy games can go back and forth between the DS and the Wii.
If you're more of a PC gamer, guess what?
You get Romance of the Three Kingdoms Part 11 comes out this week on PC.
One would think that romance by now would be stale and dead.
They'd be on Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.
Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.
I know it means romance in the classical sense.
No, there are just rabid, rabid fans of that series.
And I think all the way back to when that series was on the NES.
Dude, I spent a lot of nights playing Nobunaga's Ambition.
Remember, those games were awesome.
They really were.
I think it's neat that they've lived on through all this time.
Maze of Fate DS, a new role-playing game coming out for the DS this week as well.
And Dragon Ball Z Trilogy, because you just can never have enough Dragon Ball.
It's coming out on the PlayStation 2.
Hey, and if you want some packaged games, CSI Super Pack on the PC.
Little known fact.
Well, maybe this isn't a little known fact, but sometimes overlooked fact.
The CSI games are designed by the same folks who are very popular for their recent Strong Bad game.
So something to think about.
If you're going to laugh off a CSI game, it might not be as bad as you think.
The more you know.
Oh, I did play the Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people.
Yeah, what'd you think?
It was pretty cool.
Especially with the 7-track player.
It said that it was short-lived because the faulty part of it was the on-switch.
Uh-huh.
There was none.
I gotta read some comments here from chat because they're making fun of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms thing.
TheRobD says, it needs to be like Madden.
Romance of the Three Kingdoms 09 with a new roster.
And GameGuru reminds us there has to be a marriage of the Three Kingdoms first for there to be a divorce.
That would have been part four.
It's using romance in an all-encompassing way because right now they're on the ongoing legal battle for custody of the Petuala.
And Quiltipo makes the mandatory joke, in-joke here, how long can Lube and Cow-Cow go at it?
That's what Quiltipo wants to know.
Oh, baby.
I know what game he's been playing.
All right, forget it.
So how about other news?
How about it?
More stuff!
And it's all coming out on the 12th.
At least in Europe.
We have GTR Evolution on PC, Baja on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and PS2, and R-Type Command on PSP.
And that's it!
Drive Thru, Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200, You Lose, Good Day Sir
Congrats, I guess.
Are they recognizing us?
Oh, no, it's a Thursday.
I'm sorry.
Are they recognizing us?
A holiday now?
No, I asked off that day.
So can you go to San Francisco and go to art galleries?
Oh, gotcha.
You know, that's actually Loki's birthday.
I know.
I think that might be part of the reason he's not here.
He might be at a little thing for his day job, but I think secretly he might be wanting to spend some birthday time with the wife because his birthday is actually September 11th.
You never forget when his birthday is.
Well, my birthday was the Waco thing.
So what tragedy happens on yours?
Actually, I did not get tragedy.
I had some good things happen on my birthday.
One, sodomy laws were abolished in Texas on my birthday.
My birthday was also the day before Hitler's birthday.
And I'd like to also point out Strom Thurmond died on my birthday.
Just saying, you know, you asked what happened on my birthday.
There it is.
Draw whatever conclusions you want.
Rob I like pie Do you?
Rob I'll kill you Guess what?
Alright, look, let's move to Japan and the release date's over there.
On Thursday, September 11th, Viva Piñata, Garden Wa Dai Punch.
You know that just here as Viva Piñata Part 2.
What's the subtitle for that?
I forgot.
It's Viva Piñata 2, Something in Paradise?
Yeah, there's a lot of people that are actually really into that game over here.
Punching people in the face in Paradise?
I've actually seen a lot of really positive reviews on it.
I might have to rent it or something.
Death to piñatas?
I don't think you can kill the piñatas yet.
Although I am waiting for the minigame where you finally take a baseball bat to your damn piñatas.
Have we had that happen yet?
And find that their guts are made out of, you know, Tootsie Pops and Jolly Ranchers.
TheRobD in chat says, I leave you to envision Sky celebrated the abolishing of sodomy laws with Strom Thurmond on his birthday yourself.
Let's just leave it to the imagination, folks.
Why do you have to go there?
Double Clutch comes out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.
Speaking of double entendres.
Infinite Undiscovery.
Wow.
These are all ways that you could celebrate the repeal of sodomy laws.
Double Clutch and Infinite Undiscovery.
There you go, coming out on the Xbox 360.
Also a brand new 360 console in 60 gigabyte flavor.
Coming out in Japan on the 11th on the PlayStation 3.
Double Clutch and Stranglehold makes its way as well to the PlayStation 3 on September 11th.
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1 Nami ni Yoriyu Hiyohu is coming out.
That's a Namco game actually coming out.
Sega Ages 2500 Volume 33 Fantasy Zone Complete Collection Do you know how much this would cost you to import?
DarkTetsuya says, I think Sega heard that E all the way in Japan.
GS68 says, Jamie just fangasmed.
Can we get a mop in the studio, please?
Hey!
I actually held the microphone away from my face so that I didn't break anybody's eardrums.
So, you all owe me money now for saving you a medical expense.
Alright, and you know I love Princess Soft.
And Princess Soft is releasing a game called Sashu Shiken Kujira Alive.
Sweet, so sweet.
It's coming out from Princess Soft on the PlayStation 2.
Now we can visit the handhelds real quick and then we'll get back to some of the gaming news.
Rob likes the handhelds, don't you?
Spore Creatures is coming out on the DS as well.
It's just like, gosh, a bunch of other games.
Gakenmu Henshubu Kanshu Chojujinsu Research File comes out on the Nintendo DS as well, as well as some DS Vision games.
And a game called, what is this?
Hoshizora no Comic Garden.
I wonder if that's an anime.
Okay.
because it has a limited edition, usually limited edition games or games based on animes.
And on the PSP this week, nothing.
No games for you.
Your mom, the game.
Nothing for you on PSP, sorry to say.
Thank you.
Pull forward.
I'm adding that, by the way, to the list of official Orange Jones Radio wanted games.
Your mom, the game?
Your mom, the game.
What would you do in your mom, the game?
Zing.
Nice, nice.
You've caught me in a very weird mood.
Apparently.
How about more news?
How about it?
Because no gnoos is good gnoos with Gary Gnu.
And if none of you get that, then you're too young.
And I feel old now.
Eurogamer Expo Eurogamer is actually a very big, very popular site overseas and they carry lots of good news and have Eurogamer TV and I actually go to that site quite often but Eurogamer Network is having Eurogamer Expo and I've said Eurogamer a whole bunch of times in a row but it's at the Old Truman Brewery October 28th through 29th in London and
and there will be some more details up there but it will be two sessions each day 11 a.m.
to 4 p.m.
and 5 p.m.
to 10 p.m.
also I'm going to be playable there Street Fighter 4 Prince of Persia Mirror's Edge LittleBigPlanet Tomb Raider Underworld Far Cry 2 Fallout 3 Saints Row 2 and many more in other words all the shit we already played at PAX hey
Just kidding.
No, I think this is a great idea.
I'm just... Actually, we didn't get... I gotta haze a little.
Rob.
What?
We didn't get Street Fighter 4.
Alright, alright.
And I don't believe I saw any Prince of Persia.
I'm just messing.
So... Gotta get your feathers all ruffled.
We did get Velvet Assassin and that girl needed to eat too.
So at any rate, I would actually very much love for any of our European listeners, if you're going, write us up, review, take photos, get back, get some internet celebrity for yourself through our site.
Which hopefully we'll have our new site done by the time Eurogamer Expo happens.
I personally will be at a steampunk convention.
What do you think provoked the idea of a Eurogamer Expo?
Don't Really All They Have Is Leipzig
We went to... I liked Tap House, but it was too hot.
Yeah, Tap House was cool.
What was the other one?
Vons?
Vons.
Oh, yeah, like the supermarket chain here, but it's a bar up in Seattle.
They had taps from different breweries all over the wall, and they had big, bold letters on their banner outside.
We do not serve bud.
And I was like, this place is already fantastic.
And then they had really, really good food, and I tried some very interesting beer.
That was one of my favorite places.
We did not have... I gotta say, Seattle folks, we did not have a single bit of bad food up in Seattle.
I really didn't.
Y'all know how to eat.
We did eat some fairly... A couple places we went to were a bit more upscale than I think we were anticipating, but...
Still, I've eaten some shitty food here locally.
Look, I've eaten off the menu at Cheesecake Factory, which, you know, I don't enjoy their lunch at all.
They have good breakfast, though.
I don't think... You don't go to Cheesecake Factory for the food.
You go for the cheesecake.
But I had some great food in Seattle, which, ironically, there was a lot of people going to Cheesecake Factory in Seattle, but I was kind of like, what's the point?
You can eat that at home.
We went to the Sega World Grill, and that was cute.
Sega World Grill was great.
Best burger I've ever had and really good pizza.
So, anyway.
Good times.
Anyway, sorry.
Foodio!
Orange Launch Foodio.
Well, you know, we could eat some Foodio and play Halo 3.
Halo 3 Mythic was apparently spotted by some folks at Penny Arcade Expo.
Halo 3 Mythic showed up just before the Penny Arcade Expo official kickoff
I wonder if one of the press folks actually snuck a picture of that, what was going on.
But apparently, Halo 3 Mythic is something that was kind of poking through, maybe something that shouldn't be announced yet that's going to be coming out soon.
Apparently, Halo 3 Mythic only has a multiplayer-only menu, and it's version 1.2.
Thank you for watching!
Which has no gamer score, but is an achievement nonetheless.
If you want to see the full list of those, they are available on some various blogs out there.
They went originally on the Ascendant Justic Forum.
So check that out.
You Halo 3 fans.
Well, other things to check out that would definitely enable some Halo 3 action.
The Xbox 360 price cut is official, actually, as of the 5th of this month.
They've dropped the price of the 60GB to $299, and the Xbox 360 Arcade to $199, and the 360 Elite to $399.
Basically, I guess it's just going to pave the way for more sales, and I hope that they're not... I would think that they've gotten past where they were working at a loss on their consoles, don't you think?
They might still be taking a little loss, but I think for them to be price point under the Wii, it might just be worth it.
Seriously, and to be perfectly honest, and this is again my opinion, and a system is only as good as the games that are on it, as I've said many times, but I think that the Xbox 360 right now has the better library, and I think them dropping the price of the systems while keeping the titles where they are now is a very smart move and should definitely turn in a profit for them.
I think that's a very good idea.
Because honestly...
The games are great.
There's been very few things that I haven't really enjoyed playing on Xbox 360.
Who doesn't like Cheap?
Who?
No one.
The people that bought Yaris.
Zing.
Maybe that.
Really, that's it.
Who doesn't like Cheap?
I really like Cheap's cooking show on Parappa.
We'll see if the price cuts move more systems, which a lot of folks are forecasting that it's going to move big amounts of systems because there's going to be people to go in trying to get Wii's and folks aren't going to be able to get it, so they're going to get an Xbox 360.
We'll see.
Katamari's Forever in chat says, Oh no, now the Wii will have lower sales than the 360.
Really though, if you want Wii, you'll get Wii no matter what.
Scalper, anyone?
Misty says, I still say poopy on arcade.
Not enough storage space for my planned Rock Band downloads.
Very good point.
Even though the system might be cheaper than the Wii, it's not the greatest Xbox 360 system and I think there's going to be a lot of people out there that are going to find this out the hard way.
And then they have to fork over that extra $100 anyway a little later on for the hard drive.
That's going to be tough.
so we got one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week I can't stress this enough this is rumor and rumor only but apparently it's very interesting that this rumor is timed as soon after Penny Arcade Expo as it is and that rumor is that right now E3 the board behind E3 is in talks to make E3 public
Why not?
It's worked so well for Penny Arcade Expo, they are talking about making it public.
Apparently, the idea has officially been brought forward to the Entertainment Software Association, and that could mean as soon as next year, the show could be public.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Pax is an E3 and we've heard tons and tons of comparisons and that Pax is what everybody thought E3 was going to be when they heard about E3 and Pax is just all this stuff but just asking directly comparing the two shows since we've been fortunate to go to both and talking about old E3 and Pax at least I know what I noticed one thing I noticed people were way more laid back at Pax
It was great.
I thought it was fantastic.
With that level of... Keep in mind, you've got so many people in such an area.
Even as big as E3 was, there's going to be tensions running.
You've got a lot of professionals that have to get from appointment to appointment to appointment.
We had to do that, especially our last year at E3.
How many appointments did we set up trying to get interviews and visiting?
Exactly.
And
this without having because we didn't have to schedule interviews the developers were you know those who made it we're just there chatting about everything and being so open about about the games and letting everyone take pictures and not having all this crap especially screens people with a bug up their butt not letting you take pictures which they did this year here at PAX they were great about it but it was just so completely laid back everyone was friendly and even the enforcers I'd say they were all fantastic they did a great job and they were friendly and
They were very personable, the ones I dealt with.
Yeah, pardon my French, but everybody had to stick up their fucking ass at E3.
And that's always been kind of my problem with E3 is that people are very snobby.
I don't know if that's like the LA thing or what it is, but I don't like getting treated like shit at a video game expo.
And you've heard the stories I've told on this show about some of these big media gatherings that we've been to in the past and how we're looked down on because, you know, independent podcast.
They don't have millions of listeners.
And just like, there's a bunch... Whoa, I just threw something.
I'm so angry.
Um...
but you know people a lot of people have sticks at their ass not to say everybody is like that E3 there's some very cool people at E3 but at PAX everybody was awesome and developers are out there on the floor mingling with people like you know Loki played some game and I watched the people come up to him and say oh so did you like it and Loki was like you know yeah he was trying to be nice and give a positive answer and they they actually said what did you like about it what what what was cool about it to you I like they were asking for feedback
And you know that guy from Guitar Hero, and I apologize, I forgot his name.
He didn't have a business card to give me.
He talked to us for quite some time after the interview he did on All Games Radio.
He was very cool.
And he did confirm for me that there is no bonus peripheral for studio mode.
There you go.
But it was very cool.
People were just hanging out.
And the guy from Warhammer Online was hilarious when we had him on the show.
And then I saw him later on the show floor, and he was just hanging out, chilling, showing off the game.
People are so much more laid back at PAX.
I ran into my DM again and he waved at me.
If they put it on the floor at PAX, they realize the pictures are going to be all over the internet.
People have finally kind of gotten over it and they don't try to control it so much at PAX because they realize it's a gamer thing.
So if E3 is going to take that step, that's a big step for E3.
A lot of people are going to have to change their attitudes.
Capcom.
Just saying.
You know, I still didn't have, I think, quite the problem that you guys had at E3.
But I think that, you know, a lot of it has to do with... I'm just saying, look who didn't go to PAX.
Yeah.
Some people can't handle it, I guess.
Pax is too cool.
Anyhow, we actually asked this question on our pre-OLR twit on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR at us on Twitter.
There's been quite a few people to have this week, so thank you guys very much for that.
And we hope you enjoyed the updates from Jamie's iPhone at Penny Arcade Expo.
I was in charge of the... And sometimes the pictures didn't attach with the text I included, so oops.
Oops.
Thank you for watching!
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I mean, a lot of other expos are public, so why not?
As long as you pay for a pass and follow the rules, fair game.
Quiltipo says, Capital idea.
I've always wanted to meet D-list celebrities.
Because remember, E3 went under because of Paris Hilton and stuff.
But even PAX had their D-list celebrities.
I mean, you know, if you consider Jonathan Colton, Will Wheaton, Freeze Pop.
But we had cool people there.
That's true.
People that actually cater to the nerd crowds.
We had people there who worked for their fame.
To be fair, E3 did have Adam West.
To be fair.
Also, I want to point out, MistyOLR responded and said, Public?
You mean it wasn't public enough with all the loopholes that got exploited?
She says, Bad idea, I think, especially with your report of the last E3 you went to.
Actdeft says, Considering the success of Penny Arcade Expo, I think they want to emulate that to redeem themselves.
I do hope they get it right, though.
I apologize if I managed to announce this name.
Giovedia?
G-I-O-V-E-D-E-A?
Giovedia?
Oh, my bad.
Says, bad idea for the whole time, but good idea to open it public for a day.
It's an industry expo, not a convention.
And you know, that's something I've heard a lot, is make it more like Tokyo Game Show, where it's closed for one day, but open for the rest.
And I think that would be fair.
I think a good conclusion.
And DR of War C, I think that might be Doctor of Warcraft or something like that?
I don't know.
DR of War C says, screw E3 going public.
PAX is the new thing in town.
But really, it wouldn't hurt to have the two West Coast shows.
Forget E for No One.
Hey, wait a minute.
I'm going to E for No One.
Come on.
It might actually be kind of cool.
You never know what might happen.
Again, if you want to get the pre-OLR twits and respond to a story before the show goes live, check us out on Twitter.
Our username?
OLR.
Really hard to remember, I know.
Really difficult.
Alright, we are about to go to... Ranma says, you butcher Japanese and Italian.
Yes, I do.
Look, foreign language was my one weakness in high school, if it's not completely obvious here on the show, okay?
So, there you go.
Komo Te Lama.
Alright, uh...
Dark Sakura, what should all the kids be playing this week?
The game of the week is actually quite the obscure little title called Puzzle and Descent.
Which, um, also if you happen to find the name actually written in Japanese text, the first part of it's in Katakana and the last part's in, no, the first part's in Hiragana and the second part's in Katakana, which is very weird.
But anyway, it's a little puzzle game where you're this guy with a pointy hat who looks like a naked gnome.
It's the Travelocity gnome with no pants.
The game itself plays sort of like a combination of Pango, Columns, and Bomberman.
And the publisher on this game, for those who actually keep up with putting that on the wiki, is Nichibutsu Nihon Busan.
It was actually released on April 14, 1995.
And I almost bought a copy at PAX, but I didn't.
But anyway, the way that it works is you've got these four different colored blocks and you have to make all of them touch.
However, if three of them touch, then they vanish.
And you may actually lose the entire puzzle in the time limit that you're given because you haven't made all the blocks vanish.
And I'm actually, because it is that weird and obscure, I'm going to be linking one of the images into the chat room so that they can see what it's like.
and honestly if you can people are playing emulators just freaking download it already it's a really fun little game but keep in mind as you get further and further into the game it actually comes up a bit more like Super Silkeban if anyone's played that
and you have such a massive challenge on trying to get your blocks touching basically you have to shove them in position but as you go further you'll get some with percentage marks on them that are immobile you get ice blocks that will dissipate when they touch another object you have arrow blocks which you can only push in the direction that they're pointing you've also got a
Block, because you can actually play multiplayer.
You can block other people from making different moves.
And then you've got teleport blocks that you can move them around.
So it's just very...
Very interesting little game.
It gets very, very challenging.
And it's definitely one, if you like a game, that makes you think a little bit.
But it is only... You cannot play against the computer.
It's only against...
and many more.
I know, I want to say I've played a game like this too, and I don't know what the hell it is.
But it drove me nuts.
It's hard.
This is a hard game.
But I will put the name of it in the chat room so they can look it up.
or you can actually look at the same YouTube I'm looking at here, Puzzle and Desu.
D-E-S-U.
Very easy to spell.
Yeah.
I just want to put the name in.
And we'll link the, if you want to, since you've got it up, if you'll link that in the chat room.
Sure.
But it's really fun.
And remember, if you want to see these links as they show up, you've got to listen live to us on Sunday nights.
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com to join our chat room and AllGames.com is where we're broadcasting every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific time.
There it is, your classic game of the week, Puzzle and Desu.
Very simple game that will drive you nuts.
No calls during Part A. I guess people don't like the whole, or they're just not used to it, the whole calls during the show thing.
So we'll just have to open it up at the end of B like usual.
So much for that experiment.
Now we'll try new things.
Call us!
Nah, I already shut it off for now.
No, Colton, come back on Part B. No, we're already an hour 20 for Part A, so we gotta take a break so we can get to Part B. Alright, we'll get on Part B. Don't worry, we'll have time for calls in Part B. It's just folks are used to the end of the show.
So we'll do that.
We're going to take a quick break.
We'll be back though with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after a quick break.
We'll see you then.
Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here from Orange Lounge Radio with an important message.
Every year thousands of yellow wizards are about to die from a horrible outbreak, food shooting.
Shooting food causes the loss of life in many red warriors and green elves across the planet.
Elf needs food badly, so please think twice before shooting food this holiday season.
The Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault.
Remember, don't shoot food.
There are a couple of other things I just tell you when I remember.
He's crazy.
If you could not see the similarities in the personalities within like the first couple of episodes, you need brain surgery.
I mean, seriously.
Slap.
How?
You have to hit me so hard.
It wasn't that hard.
Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your hosts DJ Ranma S and Kuro Usagi.
Log on to DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.
Hi, I'm Gsteel, and I just wanna say that you are all losers for listening to video game quote, music.
Music from video games is just a bunch of beeps and blips.
I don't understand how people say music from say, Final Fantasy, Streets of Rage, or Maximum Twin's music.
It's from video games and therefore talentless garbage.
Using Koshiro and Nubo Uematsu can partake of my genitalia.
Video games' life can go to hell from making a big deal out of electronic beeps.
Go listen to real music because music that has no tolerance needs to be banned.
K-Things 5.
P.S.
This PSA is brought to you by La Milana, home of the never-ending Hell Temple music.
Gaming Radio.
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 7th, 2008 For our 293rd episode, if you can believe it There was a little boo-boo in the numbering of the podcast last week And some folks think they got episode 291 twice But no, it was just misnumbering, an error on my part Shoot me
Remember, don't shoot Rob.
Rob is not food.
Not with us tonight, of course.
Techmaster Loki is out for the night, but that's okay.
It's DarkSakura and myself feeling the love, but just platonically.
Thank you.
She's married.
I'm gay.
All right.
You guys are filling in as the co-hosts tonight.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have some things you want to say.
Some folks commenting on the various commercials there that were being played during the break.
Having to recycle a little bit.
If you have some promos that you want to have played during our free break, send them on in to us.
Rob at OrangeLaundry.com.
You can send me an email.
Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some gaming news this week with some news on the PSP.
Sony PSP and PlayStation 3
And you can do that.
That will be happening this fall in Japan, but probably is going to inevitably happen over here as well.
I mean, if there's money to be made, why not?
Sony, by the way, is also going to be launching a new infrastructure mode.
This is something that happens when you connect the PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3.
and you can do this all wirelessly and then what happens is that you can actually do some type of like multiplayer modes through a PlayStation 3 connection for some games so you kind of use your PlayStation 3 as like a hub to kind of do wireless stuff between the PSP which is kind of interesting could be interesting to see what they do with that but certainly there's been a lot of love between the PSP
PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation 3.
So it's very neat to see those two work together.
In a way, it seems like Nintendo's just catching up in that regard with the whole DS demos finally making their way to the Wii just a couple months ago.
We've been waiting.
Huh, nice.
I'll tell you other things that we've been waiting for, at least people who are fangirls like me or fanboys not like me because I'm a girl.
Of course, we all knew that Kingdom Hearts was going to be a PlayStation 3 exclusive and there's going to be something about that at Tokyo Game Show.
Well, really though, it's a rumor.
but, you know, we won't know unless we hear something official from Tokyo Game Show but I honestly though, given that Kingdom Hearts has already been pretty much strictly well, except for the DS version which doesn't count but seeing that Sony's been pretty much sticking sorry, Squeenix has been sticking with Sony for this franchise for the most part I wouldn't be surprised if it's going to be a PS3 exclusive so, we'll see
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and DarkSakura.com.
What's up with that?
I go places without Dan.
He's not too happy about it, but I do.
All right.
All right.
Back to video games and the real world and so on.
No, that's cool.
Hope he has fun wherever he goes.
But he better not miss another Sunday or he's so fired.
No, I'm kidding.
All right.
PlayStation Network games also going to be simulaunched in the UMD form
Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe is actually going to be releasing collections of PlayStation Network titles that are going to be on UMD.
There's the Power Pack, which is going to have the games Flow, Syphon Filter, Combat Ops, and Beats.
And the Puzzle Pack will include Lemmings, Go Puzzle, and Go Sudoku.
So for those of you that didn't feel like getting the games on the PlayStation 3, or you've still been too cheap to get a PlayStation 3, now you can get these on UMD for the PlayStation Portable, which I think is kind of interesting there.
It's kind of interesting that...
There's still that cohesiveness between PlayStation 3 and PSP.
I think that's kind of interesting that the titles are so... I know we joke a lot about the DS and the Wii getting a lot of the same ports, but I mean, for real, you're seeing the exact same games, exact same thing, going between the PSP and the PlayStation 3.
It's kind of interesting.
So you'll be able to check that out in Europe.
Honestly, I imagine if it sells well over there, it's probably only a matter of time before that stuff comes out over here.
I mean, where there's money to be made, right?
Right?
We'll see.
Well, that's pretty much the way that it works, isn't it?
Well, at any rate, we do have some other news.
We also have some information about a little big planet.
It's supposed to be having a limited public beta this month.
And I think that's pretty cool.
There's no other details about it, but they said you'll be able to sign up for it.
It just doesn't say how or when or well, but it will be made public right before the test is to be launched.
They also do have an invite-only method.
But they said they'll be large enough that people around the world will be able to have fun with it.
Is that like a Gmail thing?
Remember when Gmail invites were very rare?
Or wait, no, no, no, LiveJournal.
Remember when you got one invite code for LiveJournal?
Yeah.
Remember that?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DJ Max DJ Max
DJ Max Games coming out.
Pentavision has announced they are coming out with two new titles.
Pardon me for horribly mispronouncing these names, but there's Klaziquil Edition and Black Square.
I know I got that one right.
Pentavision is actually going after both the hardcore and the casual gamers.
It's not really...
Thanks for watching!
BlackSquare
Maybe.
Some folks in chat room are definitely feeling pretty hardcore about this.
Gsquared68 is a fan of the game and says, Wait, what?
Oh, they're probably just limited editions.
They need a feature that tracks percentage and not just score.
Scoring system equals combo based equals epic fail.
But Actdeft says, Yay, DJ Max.
So there you go.
Well, in other PlayStation news, and this should make some of our European listeners happy, is that there will be randomly selected PS3 owners in Europe who will be able to get the demo of Motorstorm Pacific Rift, which was only exclusive to the U.S.
for people who bought copies of Core on PSN.
For any of...
The, uh, basically for any of the players in Europe who also, I do believe, purchased the game, it will be available, and it's supposed to include the Airzone track, so you can give it a try, and it has support for single player and two player split screen, so it'd be cool.
And actually, it's supposed to be free for a few days before the official release.
Motorstorm 2 is very pretty.
It was a very popular demo, so I didn't get to get my hands on it, but it looked very pretty from what I noticed.
I like the jungle scape much more than the dirt of the first one.
I think the jungle was a much better setting for the game, although I would like to see, I don't know if it's too much to ask for a game with a little more diversity.
Give us some jungle and some dirt.
Those are the great racing games.
Even Excite Truck did that.
Dirt.
Exactly.
Well, guess what game you get to experience all over again.
Well,
That's right, all over again.
As if the PC wasn't enough, and the PSP wasn't enough, and the Xbox 360 wasn't enough.
You get to get Shinin' and Luminous, and your mobile phones weren't enough.
You get to do this all over again on the PlayStation Network.
That's right, Luminous Supernova was announced for the PlayStation Network this week, and it is the same game you know and love, but with some new stuff.
You know there's going to be some new skins, some new songs, and some new modes.
They've announced Dig Down mode.
You use the falling blocks to erase squares from the playfield that already has blocks on it.
Mr. Driller!
No.
I'm joking.
Spice World was a crabby game
So there you have it.
Supernova, 40 unlockable skins in challenge mode.
Also, of course, skin edit, time attack, puzzle mission modes, two-player versus mode.
No release date set yet, and it's not known if it's going to take the microtransaction approach that made this game so controversial on the Xbox 360, where you only buy the base game and then have to buy everything separate.
My gut tells me no.
Is it Ness?
Is it Ness?
It's not net, it's Earthbound-like.
I don't know, I only say that because it's a little kid wearing a baseball cap, so it reminds me of that.
But there you have it.
So, yeah, it's going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.
I'm kind of not interested because whatever they put in this game will be recycled into Luminous 3, which I'm sure is inevitable.
Or they'll release this yet another microtransaction for Xbox Live Arcade, I bet.
And honestly, the well mode doesn't sound that interesting.
Sequencer mode sounds okay.
I'd like it better if you could use your own songs.
Maybe, someday, maybe.
Who knows?
Alright, well every week here on Orange Lounge Radio we allow you guys to interact with us, not just through the chat room and the phone calls, but your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and every week DarkSakura digs into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite emails and reads them for you live here on Orange Lounge Radio and I'm sure the email's been collecting as we were away at PAX.
Kinda.
So let's get to it.
I don't know if she has time to read them all, but she'll at least do some of her favorites tonight.
I can read most of them.
Hey OLR, ever since 2006, I was very excited for the Wii since it came out.
I purchased one early 2007.
I had to work to pay it off all summer.
I bought all the big Nintendo titles and played each of them for about 20 hours until I got stuck.
Then I got an Xbox 360.
They are incomparable.
The Xbox 360 has good online experience and great high-definition graphics.
After watching Nintendo's press conference, I have completely lost hope.
Obviously, Nintendo doesn't need to do anything for us.
Long story short, my Wii is ending today on eBay, and I'm hoping to get a lot from it, seeing as how it still is in demand.
Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts.
Here is spelled H-E-A-R...
Here are your thoughts on this.
Love your show, keep it up.
By the way, my name is Dan and my gamer tag is DanThe3rd.
Okay, you have a good name.
That's up to you.
I'm not getting rid of my Wii.
I still have stuff on that that I like to play.
Stuff on 360 I like to play.
It just really depends on what type of things that you like.
I mean, there's stuff on PS3 that I like to play.
It...
You know, it's been a little while since we've reiterated the golden rule of gaming for our listeners, so why don't we remind the listeners of what the golden rule of gaming is.
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So I'm going to hang on to my Wii because I want to try it out because it might actually be pretty cool with the internet in the room speak thing.
We'll see.
Time will tell.
But I wouldn't know if I sold my Wii back in a panic and they might be even harder to get when you want them again or you might think you make a profit off it now but it's a risky game.
It's a risky game to play.
But at the same time, if you're not enjoying your Wii and you're never playing your Wii and you don't think there's anything in the future, then sell it.
Some other family probably really wants it.
Why not?
Make some money off it, but realize I've seen people do this.
I've even seen a good friend of mine do this where he'll get a system, sell it back, buy the same system six months later, sell it back, buy it again.
I'm just kind of like, what are you thinking?
You're losing so much money doing that.
If you think something's going to come out on it that you want to play in the future, hang on to it.
You'll save money in the long run.
Next email up, and this is regarding Evangelion, actually.
Hi, I have a friend that is obsessed with Evangelion, and I was wondering if there are any good games from that series.
The answer is no.
Unless you like playing the dating sim kind, and then I've got, there was, you know, the Saturn ones that came out.
I think there was one on Nintendo 64, and there most recently came out one, I want to say on PS2, was it?
I don't seek out these games.
They're still making Eva games, so just look online.
The Pachinko game is the best one.
Go for that.
Anyway, he says he is learning Japanese, so importing is not a problem.
Okay.
If it has that crazy intro theme from the anime, it gets bonus points.
Sure, they all do.
They all do.
In fact, I can tell you from experience that at least one of the Saturn ones has a full opening like it was an episode.
It's set up like an episode, basically.
I would make him ask for himself, but I'm still working on converting him to OLR goodness.
You guys and Gal are great.
You're funny, kicks my brain, and I enjoy it every week via podcast.
Someday I will listen live.
That is not a threat, it's a promise.
P.S.
DarkSakura, why do you hate Ayanami?
Because she's boring and has the personality of a bedsheet.
and Asuka could kick her ass.
I have no idea what you're talking about, but it's funny.
She's a clone girl with no personality.
PPS.
I hope I avoided the grammar attack.
That was scary.
Well...
You did okay.
Let me distract the Grammar Nazi, DarkSakura, with some chat comments.
The last email generated a lot of chat comments talking about the kids wanting to sell back his Wii.
Skylark in chat says, Fuck my Wii.
I haven't played it in four months.
Can't sell it, though.
Spent $300 on virtual console.
Then again, I've probably bought a lot on that too.
Skylark also continues to say, only good for a party environment.
TheRobD says, some other family wants it.
Think of the children.
Sell your Wii.
Is anyone thinking of the children?
Actdeft would like to point out that bed sheets are warm and sometimes comfy.
That's only when worn by other bodies.
She has the personality of a stalactite.
Xenovore, Yes I Eat Aliens, Munch Munch, Crunch Crunch, Slurp Gulp Happy
DarkSakura++
Oh, thank you.
Next email.
I think it's time to check how the Eye of Judgment is doing in sales, don't you?
I listen to you guys to put me to sleep.
No, you're not that boring.
Hey, wait a minute.
Let me finish.
No, you're not that boring.
It's just more entertaining than music.
And I have not heard anything on the Eye of Judgment.
Is it just me or did you forget?
Sincerely yours, Richard, a.k.a.
The Doctor, a.k.a.
XGC The Doctor, a.k.a.
That One Guy.
Okay.
Look, it's not going to sell a million.
I hate to break it to you, but I will look up the numbers right now while DarkSakura reads the next email.
Hey, OLR.
Tybon here from Kenya.
I haven't been able to take a picture of Samara's Cafe yet, but the pic is coming.
I finally bought a Nintendo DS, so I'm looking for some recommendations on some RPGs I should import for the system.
Sorry for the shortness of my email, but I'm typing this out on my iPhone.
Thanks for the read on your show, Tybon...
I can't pronounce it.
Yeah, how are those iPhone sales doing in Kenya?
They're all over the place.
This message is brought to you by Kenya, home of the never-ending mud walls.
P.S.
This isn't my email address.
I was banned from Gmail.
You can't get banned from Gmail.
The guy is following me on Twitter.
It's a lie.
Admit why you are lying.
Why do you do this?
I just think it's funny.
I know, I know.
Get the world ends with you.
I have judgment.
220,000.
22 million.
So you're just over one-fifth of the way there.
Final Fantasy VI.
And then watch out for the Kenyans because they run really fast, according to that one commercial.
Okay, next email.
How goes it?
It goes.
So yeah, I tried to make some sense when typing, but I'm horrid with punctuation and grammar in general.
Uh-oh.
It's not something... This is the one that I sort of savaged before.
It's not something I really picked up on and was in trouble a lot as a kid when you were supposed to learn all that stuff.
Well, that being said, it's me, Glider, a.k.a.
the 56K-er, just had a few things to mention.
A little bit pissed about digital life this year.
I've been going to the... For the past few years, gonna miss it this year, but oh well.
Speaking of Jet Set Radio, one of my personal faves, another unusual skating game that was on PlayStation 2, Yaya Cabalista.
Okay, City Skater.
I played the crap out of it and was good very close to Jet Set Radio.
It could use a little skateboard that you put on an analog stick and held the controller sideways.
Very painful on the thumbs, but nonetheless fun.
I'm really good at reading run-in sentences, aren't I?
Yes, I remember what else I was going to say.
Rob!
Rob!
He put it all in caps, so I had to say it that way.
I heard you crack the dial-up joke.
The 56k has been my handle for almost 15 years now, so I'm not giving it up, even though I do have high-speed broadband 20 megabytes down and 8 megabytes up.
It's about average these days.
But real quick, I did used to use shotgun to 56k modems, you know, sync them and dial out.
to different services with the same login.
But it's also a good way to blow out your MOBO and modems.
Look, at least you're not the 300 bodder.
Okay, because when I was on the Commodore 64 back in the day calling BBSs, 300 bod, yo.
300 bod.
Anyway, keep up the good work.
Catch you guys later.
P.S.
Jamie, I'm really trying to have better grammar and punctuation.
Please, please don't eat me.
You know what?
Just remember that when your sentence ends, use a period.
Or if you're excited, use an exclamation point.
Or if you're asking a question, you use a question mark.
And then when you start your new sentence, you use the big letters.
By the way, that 300 baud modem, about the size of a Neo Geo cartridge.
No joke.
God, really?
I know.
Next email!
We have three left.
Hello, this is- Three!
You know what?
What?
Oh, it's fine.
We don't have a lot of stories left, so this fills time.
Hello, this is Blade 3.
I just want to say I'm a long-time listener and I've never called in, but I'm going to try this weekend.
Yes, please do.
Also, I wanted to ask your opinion about Counter-Strike Source and Knights of the Old Republic.
KOTOR!
If you've played them.
Sorry about my bad grammar.
I'm using my PSP.
That's okay.
Yours are still better than the last email.
I also wanted to tell Loki that I'm very impressed with the PSPOLR site.
It is so good.
On that note, I would like to ask his permission to use the source code for my own PSP site.
The name and images and links and stuff would be different, but I'm having trouble with formatting, so it would be handy.
Thanks.
Good show as always.
Keep it up.
P.S.
My site would be primarily used for PSP downloads such as videos, wallpapers, and demos directly to the PSP.
Well, Loki is not here to answer that question, so you'll have to ask him later.
Yeah, and he left chat.
You can always email him, though.
He likes getting emails.
He loves email.
A lot of them.
Especially email about My Little Pony.
And if you sign him up for porn mail lists, he'll love that.
Oh, he loves it so much.
It's so much fun.
Actually, we shouldn't be encouraging folks to do that because our website administrator probably would frown on that.
So, yeah, don't actually do that.
He was in his big frowny faces.
Actually, as far as Kotor, I'm sorry.
I had a friend who used to playtest that, and I got too used to hearing her calling it Skrotor.
So I have no ideas about the name, except I've been watching Udon Kru's art that they've been putting up on DeviantArt, and it looks pretty cool.
Well, when I have no opinion on the game, I mean, KOTOR's okay from what I've seen of it.
What was the other one, Counter-Strike?
Counter-Strike, Source.
Not my type of game, but Loki.
See, it's a bummer Loki wasn't here because he really plays that.
But when I don't really play the game, I turn to chat.
And Rob D says, Source was just fun.
KOTOR was revolutionary for Star Wars games and revitalized them for a little while.
There you have it.
I just kept hearing about, this game is buggy!
I hate this glitch!
Because of my friend, you.
Hey guys, I would like to comment on a story topic you folks talked about on your last show.
I would have called in then, but your 800 number was down at the time.
In regards to the story about the reworked Space Invaders game that was done for art slash commentary purposes, I feel pretty much as Jamie does.
I know because I'm right all the time.
I would just like to add my own two cents in the form of two rhetorical questions.
You know how the First Amendment to our Bill of Rights guarantees us the right to free speech?
Well, what amendment guarantees the right to not be offended?
Oh yeah, there isn't one.
Honestly, the whiny little fucker that was pissing and moaning about this issue really needs to get a grip.
Not only that, but if I was in the guy's shoes and the guys that did the exhibit, I probably would not have only kept the exhibit up, I would have most likely cobbled something together as a response to the whining.
I don't know, something along the lines of the player actually bringing the terrorists flying planes into Twin Towers but changed the plane into a flying pair of boobs or some phallic symbol instead of a plane.
Some of y'all are just vindictive like that.
Plus add a severed head, rampant cursing, a straight couple having sex, and two men kissing.
All of this would be a roundabout way of saying fuck you to the whiners.
One more thing that relates to this that I just remembered.
The original intention of free speech in the First Amendment was to protect the voice opinions...
of those whom are in a minority in a given issue.
No, I don't mean like race or anything, but I mean like those people who have unpopular views like the KKK, people who think Bin Laden is cool, etc.
Face it, not everyone has the same views slash opinions, etc.
Thanks for reading this.
Have a good one.
Honestly, that's perfectly right.
Everybody, no matter how offensive or distasteful their opinions are, as long as they are a citizen or at least legally living within this country, they do have a right to voice that opinion.
As long as they do so in...
An appropriate way.
You know what I mean?
There are some places, especially private ground, where people are not going to allow some people to say things.
A private organization may not let somebody from an outside source say something on their property.
But in the United States, we do have freedom of speech, even if it is unpopular and people are wrong.
Everyone's got a right to have an opinion.
I had to really think for a minute what that email was even about because it's been so long.
You know, like two weeks ever since Penny Arcade Expo.
Email Rob.
I'm not giving out the source code for the site.
Aww.
But, you know, he did work really hard on it.
He did earn it.
But I do want to say this.
Maybe if you could get Loki that chat thing he's been looking for, that other guy won't give up, maybe he'll make a trade.
Maybe.
I'm just hypothesizing.
Loki does go on to say, I've never played Counter-Strike, and no prawn email, please.
I get enough spam in my OLR email.
He's lying.
He loves the porn.
Just kidding.
Last email?
It's true.
We all get a lot of spam in our Orange Launch Radio boxes.
That's why I deleted mine.
Jerks.
Alright, yeah, this.
Last email, please.
Okay.
Hey guys, I would like to comment on a story slash topic you folks have talked about on your last show.
No, no comment at all.
I just read this one.
Did you?
Oh.
Yeah, boo.
Hey OLR, are you having a super special awesome Sunday?
Cookies for those who know the reference.
So anyways, I was downloading some old podcasts from the OL Archive when you guys were away for a week, and I can safely say that you have been a really great podcast throughout the years.
It was funny comparing your old expectations from the next-gen consoles and your usual antics.
By the way, DMN, Elebits is not a Katamari killer minus episode 200, sorry.
To finish, I was at Blockbuster today and saw copies of DDRX and DDR Hottest Party 2 bundles.
Since the release date is September 16th for both games, can retail stores sell the games beforehand?
Not technically.
Or does it really apply to street dates?
I was mulling over this when DDR Supernova came out earlier two years ago.
Anyway, great job at PAX and here's to another great episode.
This is from Katamari's Forever.
Sometimes too, the bundles and the game by itself come out at different times.
That's something really important to keep in mind.
That's what's going to be happening with Rock Band 2.
Rock Band 2 is coming out as a standalone game on the 360 for about a month until you start seeing the bundles hit streets.
So always keep that in mind when you see those types of things out in the wild too.
P.S.
It's my birthday at the time of reading this, September 7th, so it would really make my day if you read this.
Thank you.
Happy birthday!
Happy damn birthday!
Cha-cha-cha.
And in closing, if a Yaris crashes in the middle of nowhere and no one hears it, does the crappy game still exist?
Sadly, yes.
You know, I'm actually thinking of getting a Yaris.
I'm going to be buying a new car for Christmas.
That's going to be my Christmas present to myself, I've decided, because my previous Toyota I've had since 2001, and it's 98, so it officially turned 10 years old this year.
It's done.
It's time to put a gunshot in it and lay it down for a little while.
I'm actually thinking about a Yaris.
I love Toyotas.
If Rob gets one, that means if he gives us a ride somewhere, we can just say we're taking a ride in his crappy game.
Yep.
Bring all the jokes on that you want.
I'm really, really considering it.
Part done.
Alright, no more emails.
Mailbag at orangelauncher.com if you want to get in for next weekend.
Yes, open the floodgates of chat room.
Knock at me for wanting to get a Yaris.
Even if there were more emails, I'm not reading them.
You know, I could say I'm coming on here and getting any car and somebody would taunt me for my choice.
Get a Lancer.
I'm just going to have to do my own research.
No.
Thanks for watching!
He talks to dogs.
Yes, he's the dog whisperer.
See, either you knew that because you actually know it, in which case I'm going to make fun of you, or you knew that because you looked over here at my screen, in which case I'm going to pinch you.
Or a red show roll.
Oh, okay.
Well, that's what he does.
He's the dog whisperer.
You know, like the horse whisperer, but with dogs.
And yes, they're making a game out of it.
I'm leaving that pause for you to contemplate what this means for gaming.
Game!
and Nintendogs It Ain't, that's for sure.
It is actually a TV show on National Geographic Channel.
It was rated by the ESRB and then it kind of slipped away for a little while.
Well, now there's box art.
It is really happening and a PC version.
No idea what exactly you do in this game, but damn if you, I mean, I know they say don't judge a game by its cover, but for real, how can I not?
It's a freaking dog whisperer game.
Please.
This game has been judged.
Gong.
There you have it.
The end.
Dog Whisperer.
GameGuru says, sounds like another crappy Ubisoft game.
That's what most people are saying, actually.
Sounds like dog poo.
Yeah, the dog pooper.
Poobisoft, says Frisbee.
I like that.
That should be their new name, Poobisoft, whenever they have a crappy game we're talking about on the show.
I like that.
Don't forget that.
Poobisoft.
Loki's in chat and says it's not as bad as travel games for dummies on the DS and the My Stop Smoking Coach.
I want to say we talked about that My Stop Smoking Coach a few weeks ago when it was first announced.
That isn't nearly as bad as the freaking Dog Whisperer.
I see a lot of potential for My Stop Smoking.
But Dog Whisperer?
Really?
Really?
Really?
Dog Whisperer.
How?
PluckyGuy wants to see a Dog the Bounty Hunter game.
I don't know about that.
He's a controversial individual.
I don't know if you've heard the stories.
Alright, new story, new story.
Next story has to do with Space Invaders the keyboard.
They have made a Space Invaders keyboard.
And, um...
It has little letters on top of the little aliens on the keys and you really can't see them that well unless you're staring at them.
And then it has the shooty thing on the space bar.
It's a Space Invader keyboard for PC.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know what I'm going to do when my keyboard dies?
Especially after I punch it in the face.
Well, if it had a face.
For the stupid fucking drivers not working.
Thank God I'm moving to Linux.
I'm going to repaint it.
Just for fun?
I'm going to paint a big Pac-Man on it.
You should paint fire on it.
I'm going to paint Pac-Man on it.
Paint Pac-Man on fire.
Paint your butt on fire.
What?
I didn't eat Chipotle today.
Anyhow.
Oh, God.
You know this shows hit rock bottom when we start making poopy jokes.
Anyhow.
by the way what a great lead into our next story speaking of lowest common denominator jokes I was going to say speaking of flaming butt every time the lowest common denominator gets brought up especially in games you can't help but reference the game Choaniki and if you don't know why Choaniki just google it
Just Google it and you'll see why.
Here's the thing.
Cho Iniki is... Now, this might come as a shock to you.
The game is out on Virtual Console in Japan.
It actually came out in Europe as well.
Here's the thing.
It's been rated by the ESRB.
That would be the American board.
They rated it E10 for mild suggestive themes.
No, here's the other thing.
It's been dated for Monday.
I'm downloading Cho Aniki!
Meaning, by the time you hear this episode, if this story isn't bullshit, which, you know, when the ESRP's involved, it may not... You may be able to play Cho Aniki on Virtual Console in America.
I just dropped my mic.
The unthinkable has happened.
Jamie has been so excited, she dropped her mic.
I'm happy.
Cho Aniki is so much fun.
I think it's kind of gay, actually.
It is very, very, very gay.
But in a good way.
I mean, if you actually go and say this game is gay, I'm actually going to agree with you.
I'm going to be like, yep, it is gay.
This game totally does it with other games of the same gender.
Frisbee says it is on the Nintendo website.
It's happening.
Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars
Legend of the Seven Stars
on the virtual console for download.
And as Loki in chat says, and I'm sure he would say if he were here in studio right now, motherfucking Super Mario RPG.
Word, Loki, word.
So, to continue on.
Yes, more, Choaniki 2?
No!
Quelltipo does want to point out, the first Choaniki game is the tamest in this series, and it is the first game.
Sheet music, Rob.
Sheet music.
Yes, sheet music.
What the sheet?
Well, it's sheet music that is titled Killer Instinct 3 main title.
It could be a fake.
It could be Photoshop-ity.
But it's been found somewhere.
And it says...
A Killer Instinct 3 And by the way, if anyone wants to hop out their MIDI recorder, it actually looks fairly complex and I can't play that high, so whatever.
I'm surprised nobody's tried to turn it into a MIDI file yet.
But here's the thing, what if it's just printed out from Cakewalk?
Like, it's not that hard to make a fake song and print it out with a fake title.
I don't know.
I think my BS meter is going off the charts on this.
But you remember the Christmas card thing that Rare did before?
Uh-huh.
With the KI3 Christmas card?
Mm-hmm.
Well, there was that, and now we have this music.
And now there were other rumors that were floating around.
Like there was the Fulgore picture, remember?
Yeah.
So it could happen.
And it could not.
I liked Killer Instinct.
Me too.
Don't get me wrong, but I don't know.
That would be a hell of an announcement maybe in 2009.
We'll see.
But I don't know.
I'm not going to hold my breath.
I would love nothing more than this.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
My FU of the week goes to the man with the small penis driving the truck that uses too much gas at the shopping center where I got my Starbucks from.
Stop doing cocaine!
I don't know how much I should say.
My FU of the week goes to...
Just say it.
A particular individual I'm thinking of.
No, I don't want to say it because if you give it attention, it only grows.
A particular individual I'm thinking of that really, really needs to stop stalking me.
And this isn't a joke.
It's not an OLR listener thing.
It's something going on in my real life.
I honestly feel like I'm being stalked by a certain individual that needs to cut the shit out and just move on with themselves because it's so frustrating.
And yeah.
Stop being immature.
Grow up.
Grow up.
Grow up!
That's it.
I guess that's it, huh?
Yeah, there's no one else here.
Just you and me.
Well, then I guess I'll do another story, huh?
I was going to say so.
All right.
Xbox Live.
Hey, if I want to take my aggressions out on something, I could punch people, and I will be able to do that in King of Fighters 98.
This game is going to Xbox Live Arcade.
You know, Fatal Fury?
I have several versions of that game.
Probably before the end of the year, I'd imagine.
King of Finders 98 on Virtual Console.
I might have to check that out.
We'll see.
Well, in other news, and this makes me specifically happy, and this is what actually brought it to my attention, is that one of my LiveJournal friends linked the trailer for Dissidia, Final Fantasy.
There's a YouTube video up.
But basically, it's a dramatic progressive action that's supposed to be like a fighting game with an RPG element, I think.
Um, but you move through a field map and then you have to fight different people.
But it's sort of actually, um, some of the, uh, fighting sequences are actually a lot like what was in Kingdom Hearts 2 where you run up walls and do all kinds of special stuff and earn points.
But the cool thing about this is actually, um...
who the characters in the games are.
Actually, you've got your villains and your heroes.
You've got the Warrior of Light from Final Fantasy versus Garland.
You have Frianel from Final Fantasy 2 and Unite.
They've shown Squall and Zidane and Tidus.
There's also, for some of the villains, there was the Emperor from Final Fantasy 2, Cloud of Darkness, Golbez, X-Death, Kefka, Sephiroth, Ultimecia, Kuja, and Jax from the...
Other ones.
I mean, I'm sure there's going to be more people from the other Final Fantasy games, some of the heroes coming into it.
But I think that's going to be pretty cool.
I'm looking forward to it.
I have to say, my inner fanboy is very pleased.
This game's been a little bit off the radar, but it looks hot.
Like, I really want to check this out when it comes out.
And I hate admitting that.
Like, you know what I mean?
But this game looks awesome.
But it's supposed to be just all the major heroes versus the major villains.
It has freaking Garland in it.
That's awesome.
Nomura is doing the character designs, but trying to keep some of Amano's style to it.
At least some of the characters are.
But they also said they used Jekt instead of Seymour for the Final Fantasy X references so they didn't have to put Yuna in it.
I don't know.
Well, there'd be too many people that would get too big of a thrill out of punching Yuna in the face, sadly.
Sorry, Yuna fans.
And they said that it's actually supposed to have twice as much dialogue as Crisis Core.
Dang.
Alright.
This could be fun.
We'll see.
I'm hoping so.
Alright, well another game that could be fun, Warhammer Online.
As you notice if you're listening to Part A, I had some fairly favorable things to say about the game during my little review of it.
I played it at Penny Arcade Expo, and a lot of you have been getting the chance to check this out too.
The open beta launched this weekend, playing Warhammer Online.
The beta launched earlier this morning.
Now, of course, it hasn't gone without some flaws.
Apparently some of the
Thanks for watching!
So yeah, it looks like there's a lot of problems with it.
But in theory, the beta is open, but it's probably just going to take a couple days for it to be ironed out.
But you know what?
Let's look at the long-term thing.
It's better this happen now than the day the game is actually supposed to come out and be on shelves and be out there for everybody, right?
Is it just me?
I don't know.
I'd rather this happen now.
But of course, then again, if I were one of these people trying to work my butt off to get in, I would probably also be pretty pissed, especially if I just happen to be outside the United States.
That's never cool to get the shaft.
because of where you live.
But in theory, it's up.
Hopefully, it'll get ironed out in the next couple days.
We'll see.
Skypline will be open very soon at www.orangelaunchradio.com.
Click on Interact With Us, our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, or 1-877-GAME-OLR in the U.S.
and Canada.
for people who are interested in Call of Duty 5 at least as far as our European listeners the World at War multiplayer beta will be out for PC and Xbox 360 in October the PS3 one has not yet been announced there's a chance it may not happen and
Nothing about we.
So it will be... They said the boot camp will open its doors and they haven't named a date yet.
But the speculation though would be November 14th for the actual release date.
So...
So they're thinking that it would probably correspond with the US one.
At any rate, you'll be able to use the squad system, be able to try some of the other new modes in it, the multiplayer mode.
So it'll be pretty cool, and I'd like to see what people think about it.
Call of Duty 4 was really freaking cool, so I have high expectations for Call of Duty 5.
Alright, well hopefully Call of Duty 5 does not disappoint.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Social Networking Site Raptor RAPTR
You can also download an optional PC client.
And basically what it does is the service kind of watches you on all of these various sites, and it tracks all of your gaming progress, so to speak, on one site.
Also, it'll let your friends know when you're online and playing games.
So if you're actually using the free PC client, folks can see when I'm playing World of Warcraft.
So if you're kind of one of those people that always has a hard time finding friends to play online games with or whatever, whenever they're online, Raptor could be an option.
RAPTOR.COM
Be careful when you think about those things because these sites really try to get you to link to everything.
They're just trying to hoard out to as many people as possible so that they can get their numbers up to possibly sell ads or whatever they're going to do in the future.
Could be interesting.
We'll see.
I really would like to get them on the show and just ask them what's the point.
Maybe they can justify it.
I imagine there's got to be a reason to it.
They've had a lot of money invested in it.
I believe it's from one of the co-creators of
God, what was the other thing he made?
I don't remember.
Was it Steam?
Don't quote me on that.
Somebody in chat will probably remember.
The guy made something else that was really big and popular.
I don't remember off the top of my head.
I don't remember either.
But I signed up for it.
If you want to send me a friend request, I guess so.
Sky is just my name on there.
Just like Twitter.
S-K-I-E.
So, there you go.
Unless you're my stalker, then you can't add me.
Sorry.
Because I don't need that person finding me in Warcraft.
GS68 here Last week I got around to playing Street Fighter 4
Well, I didn't really play it much, so I don't know much about the game mechanics and stuff, but the first thing you see is the graphics, and they're really nice.
My complaint is that the male fighters look a little too muscular.
Do the female fighters have too big of boobies?
Like everything is really overemphasized or what?
I'm not sure.
What they liked about the setup here at San Jose State was that they had two cabinets and they're linked up so that way... Which is good because not only does each player have their own cabinet like those Japanese cabinets but...
You can also play one player mode without if someone else is already playing in this mode called beginner mode.
And it basically lets you go three rounds without anyone challenging you.
Which is nice because I suck at fighting games.
Give us an idea, how big is this game?
I mean, were there just tons and tons of people there to play?
There's always people playing.
Is this game really getting out there?
I mean, I've been so distracted by all the other goings on in the PAX world and all that.
I haven't really been following, but I know it was really big when it got into a couple arcades.
Is it slowly finding its way into more and more and more places where it's not too hard to find now?
I'm not sure how to go down there.
Only until I went down there did I discover that we finally have Street Fighter 4 here in the Bay Area.
I mean, as I've said before, the arcade scene is dying.
I mean, new arcade games tend to catch the gaming community as a whole by surprise these days.
Whereas for games on PC and console, we know exactly when they're going to come out, so there's no surprise to that.
I do want to point out in chat, AkumaJP has some comments about the Street Fighter 4 graphics.
Says the muscle is good and Chun-Li has an elephant leg.
So her legs are even thicker than ever?
Chun-Li has amazing thighs.
Sheik would put Marilee Rett into shame.
There you go.
GS68, any other thoughts on Street Fighter 4 before we get to another call?
Um, shit ass, I need to also say I forgot.
Oh yeah, now that Super Mario RPG is out, I can't wait for all of you game fans to complain, where's my Earthbound?
Where's my Earthbound?
I'll start, where's my Earthbound?
Oh.
Alright, have a good one GS68, take care buddy.
You too.
Bye.
Uh, PluckyGuy in chat says, I kinda like Chun-Li's Jungle Booty.
Nothing wrong with a big butt.
1-877... Just rub like big butts and cannot lie.
You other brothers can't deny.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call here live on this Sunday evening, September the 7th of 2008.
Let's go to the phones.
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello?
Hello, hi, who's this?
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello, this is Sag.
Hey, Sag, my friend.
How are you?
I'm doing quite alright, and yourself?
I am doing awesome.
Hello, I met you.
Zeg was one of my buddies, lives in the Bay Area.
The cupcake shop, or store, right?
Yes, he told the cupcake story, but nobody's going to get that.
He also wore the manly corset one day, which was great.
That was a fabulously manly corset.
Definitely showed off your hourglass figure.
And only three jerks that day, too.
I was quite surprised.
That there weren't as many jerks there.
Welcomely surprised.
You know, just be glad you weren't the guy in the Princess Peach outfit because his picture got on blogs and stuff.
I don't know.
You know what?
You've inspired me, Seg.
Next year, I'm going to push the cross-dressing envelope.
I wasn't cross-dressing.
I know you weren't, but I'm just saying.
I'm just making sure for everyone else listening in.
I want to incorporate a little more femininity into my outfits.
I don't know.
I just think you need to parade through the con as Frank.
Should I bring my full Frankenfurter regalia next year?
Bring it.
And you also need the curly mullet wig.
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
Seg probably had things he wanted to talk about that aren't corsets.
What's on your mind, Seg?
Well, it is in the similar vein of PAX.
I couldn't really look up for any confirmation, but I heard talks that PAX is thinking about doing East Coast.
But what I want to propose out to the listeners and all that is, how do you think the whole convention dynamic would change with a major East Coast specific for video games conference?
I do want to say this real quick.
It has been confirmed by the Penny Arcade Expo organizers, Boston in 2010.
They have already booked the venue, apparently.
Okay.
I just wasn't 100%.
I forgot where I read it.
No, that's all right.
You know, timing is everything, in my opinion.
I think they can get away with doing two shows in a year if they're really well spaced out.
Especially, you know, if it's true that they're doing it in April, that's not a bad time to do it because you have a lot of game releases.
When are most games released?
They're released in the early summer or they're released right before Christmas.
so if you have your early April show kind of promoting those spring games and you have the August show promoting the holiday games which PAX is kind of doing I think they can pull it off I would be very curious to see though if it ends up kind of if each con kind of eats each other but maybe that's what they want and when I say that I mean is attendance going to go down at one because now they have this other one available but maybe in a way that's what they want maybe that's how they're trying to control Seattle from getting too big go ahead
Well, to me, as someone who lived in the East Coast and the Midwest, I grew up in Michigan and also lived in Boston for a few years.
There was... I mean, there are...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If nothing else comes down, a large big name on the East Coast, that PAX really has a very interesting opportunity here to be something, to really fill a demand that hasn't been filled yet with East Coast.
Because you've got all the people that wanted to go but couldn't make that big huge stretch out there.
Now it's a little bit more easier.
It's like, oh, it's just a weekend.
It's less than a day to get there versus a flight across the country.
Harmonix, 2K, Rockstar
Well, I know there's people that definitely travel, but there's definitely a lot of people, I mean, there's a lot of friends I have in both of those regions that definitely can't schedule out such a huge disruption to take a lot of time off work because they have to fly across the country, but
If it was right in their hometown or very close by, that's a lot of names there.
And as far as not as many, yeah, the total amount of studios between the coast definitely leans towards West Coast.
But there's still a lot of big-name studios that had to fly everything else over.
and not every West Coast studio went to PAX either.
Like, you know, I made fun of Capcom earlier and Konami was another big name that wasn't there.
You know, not everybody's going to PAX yet.
Yeah, exactly.
So I think that also works to their advantage where they'll still get big names but they're not going to be flooding the doors like, say, Comic Con on vendors.
You know, it could be interesting.
I wonder how many people would go to both.
I'm crazy enough.
I would want to go to both.
You know, I love the East Coast.
I would want to go visit.
But I also have places to crash at.
You know, I have plenty of friends to crash at.
Especially if the shows are different enough.
If you do get those different exhibitors that show up on the East Coast versus the West Coast, I think it could be sustainable for two cons.
And shit, if they're serious about doing the Europe con too, shit, people will probably go to that too.
I mean, I don't know if we would, because it's a lot harder.
You know, when you talk international flight, that's a big one.
But, you know, I'm sure, you know, if they're doing Eurogamer Expo and Leipzig is growing leaps and bounds, what they were saying, what, like 200,000 freaking people at Leipzig or something?
Hell, you know, my coworkers were at Leipzig.
Yeesh.
Yeesh.
So, Bobby Blackwolf's in chat and says, I do eight hours from each.
and a lot of folks in chat are saying I would love to go to PAX East and I know I would like to go too.
And Actdeft, our poor listener in Mexico says, I would just like to have a MexicoCon, please.
Start one.
You never know.
Call it Mexicon.
Mexicon?
I like that.
Alright, Seg, we got a long call but it's been a great call but I gotta wrap it up.
Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we go to the next call?
Well, you know, I have to self-promote.
All cool and attractive people, and that includes you, must, you know, look into getting Strong Bad.
Have to plug my own thing.
I didn't know if you wanted to talk about that, but yes, you worked on the Strong Bad game, so you're very excited about the release, and I hear it's doing very well, right?
What, third week in a row it's top of the charts on Wii?
Third week on the top of the charts.
All right, let's go for four!
All right, take care.
All right, take care, buddy.
Yep.
All right, bye-bye.
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.
I'd be so down with PAX Boston, wouldn't you?
I would be down if someone would pay my way.
If we can make it work, we never know.
Alright, let's get another phone call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hey, it's the Rob D. Hey, Rob D. Hello!
What is on your mind, my friend?
Not too much.
I hope this connection actually works out pretty well, because I'm on a new ISP, so the Skype connection may drop.
So far, so good.
Just wanted to talk about PAX, really.
Not too much.
Well, what did you think of PAX?
Please, walk us through it.
Fair enough.
I saw you guys there, which is excellent.
And actually, I saw many all-gamers there.
I think about 25, somewhere around there.
It actually ended up being a very good all-games meetup, a very good OLR meetup.
I had Kevin DDR from the OLR chatroom and some other just really great people.
I mean, I was really surprised that... Well, I shouldn't say that.
I shouldn't say that I was surprised, but it was really great to see that everyone there was really just a cool person.
No one misrepresented themselves online in any way.
Everyone was just a lot of fun to be around.
I know this is something we usually say in the past.
I don't think all games really does this, but it was nice to see that everybody kind of adopted that creed of don't be a dick.
Nobody was an asshole, which is a good thing.
That's because Wil Wheaton had a sign up that said don't be a dick.
Except for me, I was an asshole.
Rob was the biggest diva the whole time.
I'm king of nice, damn it.
No, but seriously, in all seriousness, everybody was cool.
You know what I mean?
Sometimes when you meet strangers from the internet, you get a few weirdos in there, but everybody was pretty cool.
and having dinner with you guys and actually being able to talk with you guys.
I will admit that when we were actually broadcasting, just being surrounded by Bobby, you, DarkSakura, and Loki, I was like, what am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
You were being awesome is what you were doing.
It was great.
Yeah, a little bit, definitely.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, he definitely said that.
He actually said that when he stepped up to the mic, he was shaking a little bit, which I thought was kind of funny, although I shouldn't make fun of him too much.
I mean, it's probably the first time he's ever done anything like that, like over the internet and broadcasting and that sort of thing.
Yeah, you learn it's no big deal.
Any schmo can get an internet show, right?
It's true.
All right.
What about the actual games and sights and sounds of PAX?
What kind of games did you play at PAX that you liked?
Well, I played Mortal Kombat vs. DC, which surprised me because it was actually fun.
It's a Mortal Kombat game.
It'll never be a competitive fighter.
That's not what Mortal Kombat's for.
Mortal Kombat's really just for the fatalities, all the fun party game stuff, watching someone break someone else's body over their back and seeing 18 tibias and fibulas fly, even though no human could possibly have that many bones in their body.
They were all the same bone over and over.
Exactly.
But what else did I see?
The TNA Impact game, which I am a little bit of a wrestling fan, so I had to play that.
It was sad.
No one was playing that when I actually went up there.
One of the developers was there by himself playing his own game, which marked me as... It was kind of sad in a way.
I went up there and played him, and it was a good time.
You made his day, probably.
Yeah.
probably, although not as much as I made the day of the Lox Quest people because one of them actually stood right by me and walked me through the game and explained the different steps of development.
They have no idea who I am.
They're hoping that I'm probably some gaming journalist, but I'm just a fan and they're taking all this time to tell me that because I'm probably the first person to go by there.
Tower defense games are not exactly big things at PAX.
Those poor guys.
But, you know, I gotta say, though, PAX does give a really good shot to, like, the indie developers and stuff, especially with that PAX 10 thing.
You know, those 10 indie games were right in the middle of the show floor.
You can't miss them.
And, you know, that's probably how Jamie got caught with the sushi game and all that stuff.
You know, they're pretty good about... Those guys were great, but they were tucked away in the corner.
Yeah, they don't really have, like, the Kensha Hall syndrome that E3 has, where, like, oh, the weird stuff goes to Kensha Hall.
You gotta go to the basement.
You know what I mean?
I never actually made my way over to the PAX 10, so I can't say whether that was actually good or not.
From what I hear, it was okay, at the very least.
I got so much swag from PAX.
I got three different shirts.
I got a bunch of Rockstar stickers.
I got, what else did I get?
I didn't actually manage to get one of those energy drink samples, which I don't know if you went by there, that energy drink booth that was kind of packed away in the corner.
You thought they were giving away free cans of their drink, but it was really like, I don't know, a hundred empty cans just sitting on the table.
I saw that one, and they want you to sign up to win a case or something.
I did sign up, though, for the ECA, and they were giving out Balls Geek beer.
Really?
I didn't see that.
It was so good.
Root beer with caffeine.
Ooh.
That does sound good.
What else did I see?
I didn't manage to actually play any of the games that had a gigantic line, like LittleBigPlanet.
I just kind of stayed away from those.
Oh, you missed out.
LittleBigPlanet was great.
Now, granted, you know, we were a little spoiled since we got to go in a little bit early.
You know, there wasn't a line for it.
And we got to get walked through by the U.S.
producer.
And, yeah, I was spoiled, but, man, so worth it.
I'm all about LittleBigPlanet now.
Yeah, I have expected the Sonic RPG to be horrible.
I went by the Sega booth, which took me a little while to find at first until I realized that there was a gigantic Sega sign.
Do you know we didn't even realize Sega was there until day two?
I mean, they didn't exactly, like, there weren't any Sega signs, like, on the booth itself.
It was just the giant Sega sign hanging from the ceiling, and you wouldn't really notice that unless you were a really far distance away, and by that point, you may have gotten distracted by tons of other booths.
You know, you're going toward the Sega booth, and they're like, ooh, Afro Samurai, I should play that, which is also great.
That game was hot.
I love the Little Red Riding Hood Killing the Zombies game.
That was hot too.
That was funny.
Alright, Rob D, we've got to wrap it up here because we can probably get one more call, but quickly, best thing about PAX and worst thing about PAX?
Best thing about PAX, the people, without question.
I like the con, I like the exhibitors hall, but actually being able to see everyone and talk with the people that I've been chatting with over the last few years was just really just made for an unparalleled experience at any con I've been to.
The worst thing, the amount of people.
The amount of people, by far.
I couldn't actually make it into any panel without waiting at least an hour in line.
By the time I saw how long the lines were, I didn't even try.
Something was going to have to be done about that for next year.
I don't know what, but they'll think of something fair.
We'll see.
Maybe they'll get to organize it better.
They'll figure out how to organize it better.
I mean, the fact is that they've only had five years, which isn't really a long amount of time for any con, especially when they've been in the Seattle Convention Center for, I think, two years.
True.
Very true.
And there's a whole sixth floor.
I bet they're going to have to open it next year.
We'll see.
Thanks for taking my call.
Because what was going on?
Gender Odyssey was going on at the same time we were there.
I think so.
Yeah, they kind of kept that on the down low, which is probably a good idea with...
with how immature gamers can be on occasion.
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't have cared, you know, heck, with all the years I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show, I've seen everything.
But, you know, I think it's kind of interesting how segregated they kept the two.
Very interesting.
Alright, Rob D., thanks for the call.
Take care, buddy.
And good to meet you.
Yep, you too.
We'll see you next year, right?
Hopefully.
Alright.
Work on it.
Save your pennies now.
Alright, see ya.
That's all I'm going to have to do is start saving now.
I think we can fit in one more call.
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
I think after one more call we should be good here.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, Guy, and Blade 3.
Blade 3.
What is on your mind, Blade 3?
Not much.
It's kind of late where I am.
Where are you?
Are you on the East Coast?
Yeah, it's 12.
All right, it's way past everyone's bedtime over there, but that's all right.
We're trying to wrap up the show so y'all can go to bed.
What's on your mind?
What did you call in about tonight?
Well, I just wanted to tell Loki, because I'm sure he's still listening, that I figured out my own coding for my website.
Oh, you sent us an email wanting Loki's source code.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, so I made my own.
and you can check it out at mmtsp.tk Nice, I love that he's working in a plug.
What will I find on this wonderful PSP site?
Right now it's in a semi-beta.
Basically there's just one page and it just has links to other pages but nothing on them so far.
Alright, well you gotta start somewhere.
By the end of the week, I should have quite a few demos, some DVDs, some funny videos, and some soundtracks from games.
One more thing.
I'm making a PSP site as an add-on to my regular site, and my regular site is masterman.pk.
Plug, plug, plug, plug.
You know, we're going to start charging 50 bucks a plug.
Just so you know.
Alright, best of luck with your sites, buddy.
All right.
Have fun.
All right.
So all of our listeners need to go visit these sites.
And if they're terrible, I want you to tear this guy apart.
No, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
You got to start somewhere.
We're all about supporting the independents and new ideas.
And, you know, PSP sites aren't really getting enough love.
I mean, sure, there's a few sites out there.
But, man, that's a whole universe.
It's not really being explored as well as it could be.
So someday.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
Sorry for those who didn't get through.
But you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
Give Jamie some work to do next week.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't think so.
I think it was a sale that was only for this weekend?
I believe so.
I don't remember.
But Mass Effect went down to 300 points of Bring Down the Sky.
Lost Odyssey triple bonus pack went to 120.
Forza Motorsport 2, the Motegi track pack, and the September, December, March car packs went down to 240 each.
Oblivion, Elder Scrolls 4, Shivering Isles went to $1,600 Guitar Hero 3, Def Leppard, Foo Fighters, Classic Rock Trackpacks to $360 Beautiful Katamari, the accessory ABCD set went to $120 Special accessory as well, Just Size stage went to $120 And the Big Ten 11 stages went to $140 So that's it Alright, I like sales, I like cheap things
Alright, I do have a last minute story real quick.
It has to do with the Max Payne movie.
Tiger Claw sent me this one.
I remember reading about this earlier in the week.
It didn't make our show roll though.
But apparently the Max Payne movie has been rated R and not happy.
John Moore, the director of the movie, is pissed.
It was supposed to be a PG-13 movie.
I'm hoping he's lobbying the MPAA.
What a bunch of fuckwads.
Horrible what they've done.
Anyway, the MPAA has slapped an R on this movie, which means it's not going to be able to be seen by teenagers.
Which, who knows?
Maybe it really is for the best.
Maybe we have blurred the lines too much.
Max Payne, I would definitely put an R on that.
Well, apparently, though, he actually, he did try to dumb it down a little bit.
Like, he actually kind of cut out some of the language.
No heads are cut off.
No eyeballs are ripped out or any of that stuff.
He actually did tame it down a bit to try and get the PG-13 and still got the R. So he was kind of miffed about that, as you can understand.
But here's the thing.
He actually goes so far as to say, they gave the Dark Knight a PG-13 rating and basically sucked Warner Brothers' cock.
His words, not mine.
But you know, it's something to think about.
The Dark Knight was a pretty dark film too.
I think it just goes to show the MPAA is fucked.
Fire em all, that's what I say
Quotipo does say though, and I think this is interesting, I'd be more willing to see an R-rated Max Payne than a PG-13 version.
TigerClaw says, here's the thing, the first Mortal Kombat movie was PG-13, even though it was based on an M-rated game.
The movie wins you back because of all the kick-ass fight sequences.
Hmm, something to think about.
So, lots of good points made by everybody.
Alright, well that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, thanks you guys for sticking with us tonight.
And myself and DarkSakura holding down the fort.
It was very lovely having you all in chat tonight to help fill in as our third host tonight.
We always love having you guys on the program.
Thank you guys.
And so we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.
Final thoughts.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Poop!
My final thought is fart.
Hey, no, no.
You said fart, so I have to say dick.
All right.
We have some other final thoughts from chat.
Shaq Fu.
That's a good final thought.
Your Shaq Fu moment of the day.
All right.
That's going to do it.
Hey, guys, thank you so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting like Orange Lounge Radio, where dick and fart jokes are still okay.
We haven't sold out yet.
What about boob and burp jokes?
Boob and Burp jokes are always welcome.
Thank you guys so much for supporting us and leaving us the nice things you have been on iTunes lately.
There's been a couple people that added reviews.
Thank you guys so much for your kind reviews.
We'd always appreciate a few more five-star reviews.
It really helps out our ranking.
And therefore, as we get bumped up in the rankings, we're more visible.
Even if you can't do that, just tell a couple friends about the show.
That's all we ask.
That's our superpower is extra visibility.
You got it.
Word of mouth.
And how.
We have no magazine.
We have no corporate funded website.
We don't sell ads.
It's all about the word of mouth.
So we appreciate it.
But I do sell my virtual body on the internet.
Just kidding.
Until next time and until the next Penny Arcade Expo to see some of you guys again in person.
Although hopefully not.
We'll see some of you guys around.
certainly talk of ASEN for next year and definitely E for All for me so we'll be seeing you guys later but until next week when Loki will be back this is Rob Roberts, she's DarkSakura he's at home listening, Loki we'll all be back next week, we are together Orange Lounge Radio
