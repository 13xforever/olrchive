WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.840
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:13.840 --> 00:20.320
Tonight September 28, 2008, a Banjo-Kazooie remake gets dated, Dance Hero gets trademarked,

00:20.320 --> 00:27.440
and an old friend of ours gets the boot.

00:27.440 --> 00:31.840
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.640
Hello everybody out there on the internet.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.120
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.680
We are that podcast on the internet where every gamer has a voice, because every week

00:39.680 --> 00:43.880
we talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and we invite

00:43.880 --> 00:46.400
you to come be a part of our program.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.340
You can join us in chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, you can talk to us by phone later, send us

00:50.340 --> 00:52.160
an email, however you want to do it.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.000
You guys are going to help steer the show tonight, but we'll be here leading you through

00:56.000 --> 00:58.800
the next few hours where we talk about the latest and greatest video gaming.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.800
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.960
Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:02.960 --> 01:03.960
Hi.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.160
How are you doing?

01:05.160 --> 01:06.160
I'm okay.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.800
Your voice sounds a little better this week.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800
It is.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
Alright, good to hear.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.760
Also, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:12.760 --> 01:13.760
Hi.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.760
How you doing?

01:14.760 --> 01:15.760
Good.

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
You have a stack of cheeseburgers.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.400
I don't know if the Justin.TV users can see us, or they can't, because it's hidden behind

01:19.400 --> 01:20.720
your laptop here.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.120
He has a stack of cheeseburgers.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.120
It's only two.

01:24.120 --> 01:28.080
Because, I mean, McDonald's cheeseburgers are like micro cheeseburgers.

01:28.080 --> 01:33.360
But I'm laughing because he literally has a stack of cheeseburgers.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.240
As we'll get into it a little bit later in the program, I can't put them on the floor

01:37.240 --> 01:40.880
because, oh yeah, there's acts of nature attack.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.700
There's like, like here in the studio, which, you know, we have a real high tech studio.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.580
It's basically a converted garage.

01:46.580 --> 01:49.920
We have like ants or something that live under the floor.

01:49.920 --> 01:56.280
So the funny thing is if you put food on the ground, the ants will rise up underneath and

01:56.280 --> 01:59.360
like just storm the food is what Loki found out last week.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.360
Yes.

02:00.360 --> 02:04.520
I should have learned the first time it happened weeks prior to that, but I thought it was

02:04.520 --> 02:05.520
a fluke.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.680
I was like ants in the garage?

02:06.680 --> 02:08.400
There's no ants in the garage.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.920
Ants in my garage?

02:09.920 --> 02:10.920
All right.

02:10.920 --> 02:13.600
Anyhow, let's also say hello to a special guest we have tonight.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.440
And it's not very often that we have a fourth person joining us in studio anymore.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.960
What happened to the locals?

02:18.960 --> 02:20.040
Locals don't love us anymore.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.040
They found women.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.040
I guess.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.040
I guess so.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.040
Well, so we had to bring a woman on our show and we had to bring a non-local woman on our

02:27.040 --> 02:28.400
show, but we love her.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.860
Her name is Tiara all the way from Las Vegas.

02:30.860 --> 02:31.860
Say hello.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.860
Hi.

02:32.860 --> 02:33.860
How are you?

02:33.860 --> 02:34.860
Not too bad.

02:34.860 --> 02:35.860
All right.

02:35.860 --> 02:36.860
How was the flight?

02:36.860 --> 02:37.860
Good.

02:37.860 --> 02:38.860
The flight was really good.

02:38.860 --> 02:42.560
They messed up my ticket or the terminals were down for the like automatic ticket printing

02:42.560 --> 02:45.920
instead of having to go to the flight attendant type people.

02:45.920 --> 02:46.920
Right.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.920
And so I got upgraded to first class for 20 bucks.

02:48.920 --> 02:49.920
Nice.

02:49.920 --> 02:50.920
Yeah.

02:50.920 --> 02:51.920
Did you see anyone famous in first class?

02:51.920 --> 02:55.520
No, just a bunch of old people.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.520
Famous old people.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.520
Awesome.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.520
All right.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.520
Well, welcome.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.520
Welcome to the show tonight.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.960
And of course, the other reason why Tiara was here, she didn't come to join us just

03:03.960 --> 03:07.840
for Orange Lounge Radio, although, you know, that would be nice, but I came for Journey.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.840
Yes.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.440
Part of the way Tiara came so we could go see Journey and Heart and Cheap Trick.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.360
And if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks, you know, we don't talk about

03:15.360 --> 03:16.360
games.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.540
We talk about our personal lives.

03:17.540 --> 03:19.160
We love Journey.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.760
And if you're Jamie, we love Heart.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.360
And if you're me, you love both, honestly.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.360
You really do.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.360
And Cheap Trick.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.360
But Heart is great.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.360
Cheap Trick.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.360
They're okay.

03:28.360 --> 03:29.360
Although they're a bunch of divas because I met them years ago.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.360
But anyway, Heart and Journey are great.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.480
Now, here's the sad news is that we went to the concert, right?

03:32.480 --> 03:35.560
As a lot of folks have been listening to us weeks and weeks, we talk about this.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.000
We finally went to the concert.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.040
What should have been a 40 minute drive up to Marysville took us two and a half hours

03:42.040 --> 03:43.920
to get up there because of traffic and everything.

03:43.920 --> 03:49.520
So sadly, we had to listen to Ann Wilson belt out alone from the parking lot, which was

03:49.520 --> 03:50.840
kind of sad.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.100
But she still was really good.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.840
That woman, her voice is amazing.

03:54.840 --> 03:55.840
Yes.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.560
And we did get to, and for you Guitar Hero players, we did get to walk in there in time

03:58.560 --> 04:00.980
to hear Barracuda, which was good.

04:00.980 --> 04:02.560
So that was, I had a good time.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.360
And then of course we got to see the whole Journey and, you know, I know we're not a

04:06.360 --> 04:09.600
music program, but I will tell you Journey's new lead singer, I approve.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.840
He's very, very good.

04:10.840 --> 04:15.960
Yeah, I was really surprised because I didn't know what to expect, but he's very good.

04:15.960 --> 04:20.600
And you know, apparently their latest CD is their biggest selling one in like 20 years.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.600
That's what they said.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.480
I think Neil Sean said that part of it.

04:24.480 --> 04:28.920
So hey, all I'm saying is let's get some more Journey tracks and rock band, please.

04:28.920 --> 04:29.920
That would be great.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.100
Speaking of rock band, let's talk about your gaming week, Stark Sakura.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.460
How was your gaming week?

04:35.460 --> 04:44.440
We played some rock band over the weekend and Dan downloaded Mega Man 9, which was really,

04:44.440 --> 04:45.440
really, really cool.

04:45.440 --> 04:54.540
I mean, I was totally just in old school heaven watching, you know, a lot of the stuff.

04:54.540 --> 04:58.760
And of course it played a little Ragnarok as usual.

04:58.760 --> 05:05.320
And that's really, really about it for my gaming week.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.800
Awesome.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.800
You know, one thing I love about Mega Man 9.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.400
I was busy dealing with other things.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
Oh, sure.

05:10.400 --> 05:15.160
I wasn't able to get Mega Man 9 this week because I, you know, I have my little thing

05:15.160 --> 05:18.400
going on with the Wii where I'm not downloading anything else on the Wii.

05:18.400 --> 05:23.000
And I don't have a PlayStation 3 yet, although I'm thinking next week's the week.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.680
And then Xbox 360, I don't know, I just can't imagine playing a classic video game on that

05:27.680 --> 05:30.400
Xbox 360 controller because that D-pad kind of sucks.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.040
So I think I'm going to have to get it on PlayStation 3 if nothing else.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.640
So hopefully soon.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.600
But I love listening to the soundtrack.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.800
They just, it's, it's perfect for an old school Mega Man game.

05:39.800 --> 05:43.120
It's even, you can even use flicker to your advantage.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.280
Nice.

05:44.280 --> 05:48.000
Like if you get hit and you're going through a tough spot, you just like get hit once so

05:48.000 --> 05:50.360
that you flicker enough to get through the hard stuff.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.360
Nice.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.680
So maybe there's a reason not to turn it off.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.440
It's it.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.400
It's old school Mega Man.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.400
That's all I can say.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.400
All right.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.220
Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:01.220 --> 06:03.440
My gaming week was all right.

06:03.440 --> 06:10.280
I played a bit of Mercenaries, Mercenaries 2, and actually this week I finally got to

06:10.280 --> 06:14.200
try the co-op online and it's pretty fun actually.

06:14.200 --> 06:19.280
I was playing with my friend Sean who just picked up the game and I swear to God this

06:19.280 --> 06:22.360
game gets even more glitchier the longer I play it.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.280
It's, it's awesome though.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.280
I like that.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.520
Did Loki just say more glitchier?

06:26.520 --> 06:27.960
I think he did.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.620
Yes, more glitchier, seriously.

06:30.620 --> 06:31.620
More glitchier.

06:31.620 --> 06:36.320
I could say it gets even glitchier, but no, it's more glitchier.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.320
That's a technical term.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.720
You're the most smartest host I've ever met.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.960
I am the most smartest.

06:39.960 --> 06:40.960
Smarterist.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.280
Can we get that in an iTunes review please?

06:44.280 --> 06:45.280
Smarterist.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.080
The most, the more, this show is great, but it could be more glitchier.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.080
More glitchier.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.920
No, but the game is extremely glitchy.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.480
There's absolutely no way that they tested this thing.

06:56.480 --> 07:00.080
I think they just said, ah, fuck it, let's just release it.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.160
And that's what they did.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.160
So yeah, lots of things that are messed up.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.600
I'm trying to think of some of the fun highlights of that.

07:07.600 --> 07:12.400
There was a helicopter we couldn't get into because, or no, we got into the helicopter,

07:12.400 --> 07:14.400
but it wouldn't fly.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.640
It was a brand new helicopter too.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.880
The guy had just dropped it off for me, got into the helicopter, propeller would not spin.

07:19.880 --> 07:20.880
I was like, well this is useless.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.320
Maybe you were just too fat for the copter.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.320
No.

07:24.320 --> 07:28.600
Hey, remember, this is my in-game persona.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.600
Not real life.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.600
Okay.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.520
And then of course, you know, more Grand Theft Auto IV.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.680
Did you just have maybe too much baggage in the back?

07:35.680 --> 07:39.320
Because I think that's what happened to Aliyah.

07:39.320 --> 07:47.000
Well I was carrying around this guy from United Petroleum, the fake oil company in the game.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.720
But yeah, the game is just horribly glitched out, which is awesome.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.500
Anyways, on to other things.

07:53.500 --> 07:59.600
I played a game, a Flash game actually, called, I want to say it was Me and My Dad.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.800
It's by the same people that do, you know, Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, and it's

08:04.800 --> 08:12.320
basically you're this guy, I don't know, it's like some sort of demon kid who goes around

08:12.320 --> 08:14.280
beating up other kids.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.480
Just like most of the people in the game are completely harmless and just running around

08:18.480 --> 08:20.800
and you just brutally beat them to death.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.800
It's awesome.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.700
This sounds like a Loki dream game.

08:24.700 --> 08:25.700
It's awesome.

08:25.700 --> 08:35.920
So I played that a little bit, and let's see, also tried a little bit of Disaster Day of

08:35.920 --> 08:41.560
Crisis, and that game is so cheesy.

08:41.560 --> 08:43.480
It's pretty fun though.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.360
But kind of a really unique game.

08:45.360 --> 08:50.160
It combines a little bit of like, platforming, with a little bit of like, some stuff that

08:50.160 --> 08:55.920
reminds me of Time Crisis a bit, and just, I don't know, it has kind of the vibe of like

08:55.920 --> 08:58.520
Ghost Squad or like a Time Crisis game.

08:58.520 --> 08:59.520
Very over-the-top.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.600
Okay, I gotta go back a little bit, rewind a little bit, because Chatroom brings up a

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
good point.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.100
So, you know, first comment of the night from Shaoran in our chatroom, chat.ownershotshot.com.

09:07.100 --> 09:10.040
Why is it called Me and My Dad then?

09:10.040 --> 09:12.460
I don't know.

09:12.460 --> 09:17.800
I never saw the guy's dad at any point in this, well, in the, actually the title screen

09:17.800 --> 09:23.440
did have like a larger version of the main character, who I guess was his dad, but I

09:23.440 --> 09:24.640
don't understand what Me and My Dad...

09:24.640 --> 09:26.240
Maybe it's like a twist ending, and then...

09:26.240 --> 09:30.080
Maybe, I don't know, but maybe your dad joins you later and you can beat more people up,

09:30.080 --> 09:33.620
I don't know, but it's, yeah, that's what it was called, at least.

09:33.620 --> 09:37.760
They had a link on Destructoid for it, so if you want to check it out, just kind of

09:37.760 --> 09:39.640
browse back a few pages.

09:39.640 --> 09:45.140
But yeah, so that was fun, and of course I played more Castle Crashers, actually my headset

09:45.140 --> 09:53.040
that I use on my PC, my headphones, they kind of died, so I went out and got some nice,

09:53.040 --> 10:01.040
the Triton AX360s, so they're like 5.1 headsets now, and those are awesome, so I'm looking

10:01.040 --> 10:05.560
forward to playing more with those, and yeah, that's pretty much it.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
Awesome.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.640
Tiara, do you have anything you want to share with your gaming week, types of games you've

10:09.640 --> 10:10.640
been playing?

10:10.640 --> 10:15.440
Well, I haven't really had a chance to play a lot of games recently, since I just started

10:15.440 --> 10:22.320
with school again, so, but I did play Ragnarok with Jamie, and we played Rock Band, and we

10:22.320 --> 10:27.320
made Dan download Jimmy Buffett, so that I could sing Margaritaville.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.680
Nice.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.680
So you were the singer?

10:29.680 --> 10:30.680
Sometimes.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.000
And let me guess, Jamie's bass player?

10:32.000 --> 10:36.860
Actually, I did play a bit of bass, but I also made Dan get Skullcrusher Mountain.

10:36.860 --> 10:38.860
Very cool.

10:38.860 --> 10:44.720
Alright, so that's pretty much it then, Rock Band, and learning.

10:44.720 --> 10:50.600
That's pretty much it, and then Final Fantasy Tactics, and Joan of Arc on the PSP.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.800
I don't know much about Joan of Arc, what's this game?

10:53.800 --> 11:00.560
It's basically a tactics game, like Final Fantasy Tactics, except for it stars Joan

11:00.560 --> 11:05.680
of Arc, and it takes the whole history of what happened during the time when she was

11:05.680 --> 11:10.480
around, and turns it into this thing where magical demons are attacking, and you have

11:10.480 --> 11:13.360
to defeat them to save France.

11:13.360 --> 11:14.360
Interesting.

11:14.360 --> 11:19.600
Based on a true story.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.120
They took some creative liberties, I think, but okay.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.780
Yeah, just a few.

11:24.780 --> 11:25.780
Very cool.

11:25.780 --> 11:26.780
But is it fun?

11:26.780 --> 11:27.780
That's the question.

11:27.780 --> 11:30.400
Well, if you like tactics games, then yes, it's fun.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.760
And I think, you know, it's kind of smart, even though they replaced all the people that

11:33.760 --> 11:39.880
were invading France and everything with quote-unquote demons, it's still like if a kid played it,

11:39.880 --> 11:42.220
they might learn some history out of it.

11:42.220 --> 11:47.640
Because a lot of it is based on actual fact, but then, you know, you've got the weird stuff.

11:47.640 --> 11:52.040
Except for the demons and the magic, yeah.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.040
Very nice.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
Alright, cool.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.960
Sounds like a very interesting game.

11:55.960 --> 11:56.960
My Gaming Week.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.960
Things I've been playing, pretty much, not a lot of new stuff, I have to say.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.000
I've still been addicted to Rock Band 2.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.840
Played a little bit more Warhammer, although I don't, sadly, know a lot of other people

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
on it.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.860
I don't know how much longer I'm going to be playing Warhammer because of that fact.

12:08.860 --> 12:15.080
I know there's some OLR listeners on it, and maybe I'll try to meet up with some of them.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.400
Then World of Warcraft, of course.

12:17.400 --> 12:21.920
And I guess the only new thing I really checked out this week was Duke Nukem 3D on Xbox Live

12:21.920 --> 12:22.920
Marketplace.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.400
How could I forget playing that?

12:24.400 --> 12:25.400
Alright.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.400
Well, what did you think, Loki?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.600
Oh, it's awesome.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.120
It's exactly how I remembered it.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.880
It is, except I was kind of surprised that, well, I'm not.

12:32.880 --> 12:37.760
I mean, it's basically like the Doom port, where they didn't really redo anything, you

12:37.760 --> 12:39.240
know what I mean?

12:39.240 --> 12:44.000
But it does bring back a lot of great memories, because, man, I played a lot of Duke Nukem

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
3D when I was in college.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.320
I kind of wish they had it, but I know, I understand why they didn't have it.

12:48.320 --> 12:53.220
I wish they had the build editor in there to make their own levels, that'd be awesome.

12:53.220 --> 12:57.360
It's too bad that you can't do some type of, like, yeah, as soon as you change levels.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.720
I'm disappointed, there's no Atomic Edition in there as well, either.

13:01.720 --> 13:08.120
All the added, they had a few added weapons, and, you know, the brand new levels, including

13:08.120 --> 13:10.440
the one that, like, parodied Disneyland.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.320
I'm disappointed that wasn't in there.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.960
Maybe it's a download pack later, who knows?

13:13.960 --> 13:14.960
I hope.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
Download content, who knows?

13:15.960 --> 13:19.400
But it's a very faithful port, and if you've never played Duke Nukem 3D, at least check

13:19.400 --> 13:20.400
out the demo.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.760
I see, I think you could do a multiplayer demo, if I'm not mistaken, so you can even

13:23.760 --> 13:26.120
kind of taste a little bit of what that is all about.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.600
And you can play the first two levels, at least, and it's fun.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.120
Be sure to look around everywhere in that first level, because you can blow through

13:33.120 --> 13:37.200
that first level in, like, a minute, but if you really stop to look around, there's tons

13:37.200 --> 13:39.040
of secrets in the level.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.400
Otherwise very similar to the Doom port we saw not that long ago.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.240
That was pretty much it, though, for my gaming week.

13:44.240 --> 13:48.040
Not a whole lot else to report, nothing really new, otherwise.

13:48.040 --> 13:53.360
So let's talk about housekeeping real quick before we get into gaming news tonight.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.520
I've had to pull out of E for All, which kind of stinks, but I am not going to be attending

13:57.520 --> 14:01.720
E for All this weekend, after all, and I really apologize to those listeners that were planning

14:01.720 --> 14:03.120
on going.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.920
You know, please still continue to go to the All Games booth, which is being co-run by

14:06.920 --> 14:09.000
the Championship Gaming series.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.080
It's going to be pretty cool.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.680
They're going to have some old school gaming celebrities there, and I think that's kind

14:13.680 --> 14:16.160
of like one of the themes they're going with, is old school.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.320
And I think it's going to be a lot of fun, and I'm really sad I can't go.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.760
But do head out, especially if you're in the area.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.200
If you're in the LA area, please head out to E for All this weekend.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.200
I think you'll have a lot of fun.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.400
Sadly, I've had to pull out.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.480
I'll just say it's kind of related to, you might remember, if you've been listening to

14:30.480 --> 14:33.520
the show for a while, about six months ago, I had some medical issues.

14:33.520 --> 14:38.000
I'm okay, don't worry, but I'm probably going to have to have a surgery coming up, and I

14:38.000 --> 14:40.200
have to get evaluated this weekend, and all that stuff.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.800
So it has to do with all that.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.720
So we'll let you know more details on that as it comes up.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.840
Don't worry, it's gallbladder, it's very common, tons of people have had it.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.360
I'll be fine.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.000
So that's that.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.320
All right, so let's get into some gaming news.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.840
I don't really have a lot else to plug in housekeeping.

14:55.840 --> 14:59.960
I can't think of anything else going on, except for the fact that episode 300, provided everything

14:59.960 --> 15:05.240
stays on schedule, will be in like four weeks, which is crazy if you think of that.

15:05.240 --> 15:09.680
300 shows, and at about, most of them have been three hours a piece.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.280
I mean, some were two, some were three.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.800
So let's say you said like two and a half hours for each one.

15:13.800 --> 15:19.880
That's still like, what, 750 hours at least of content we've done over the years.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.680
It's like a million bajillion hours of content.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.680
Tons.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.680
All right.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.600
All right, anyway, let's move on.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.600
Gaming news.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.600
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

15:30.600 --> 15:36.400
Well, there's a Nintendo 64 game that's quite a classic that I never played, but looks interesting

15:36.400 --> 15:37.400
nonetheless.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
Banjo-Kazooie.

15:38.400 --> 15:46.160
We knew this was coming, the sort of remake or update to it, and it is coming now exclusively

15:46.160 --> 15:55.760
to the Xbox Live Arcade on November 26, and it will be running you 1,200 Microsoft Points,

15:55.760 --> 16:03.440
or free if you happen to pre-order at specific locations like GameStop, GameCrazy, Amazon,

16:03.440 --> 16:04.680
whatnot.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.920
And I believe you do get it a few weeks early that way, too.

16:07.920 --> 16:16.640
Also announced in the same press release is Banjo-Tooie will be coming as well early 2009.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.640
So that's pretty cool.

16:17.640 --> 16:23.880
One other unique thing about this as well, there will be a stop and swap mode, and what

16:23.880 --> 16:29.640
that's exactly going to do is progress that's made in the Xbox Live Arcade game will unlock

16:29.640 --> 16:33.400
things in Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.560
So that's kind of cool.

16:34.560 --> 16:38.840
That's an interesting little crossover, but just kind of a ploy to get people to spend

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
their money twice, right?

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
Yeah.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.820
But, I mean, it's not like they're the first people to ever do that, so...

16:43.820 --> 16:44.820
By commando.

16:44.820 --> 16:48.000
Except they didn't really have it locked, you know, it was more of a code, though, that

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
they gave out in that game.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.840
Well, plus, you know, sometimes there's like DS and Wii things that kind of do that, like

16:52.840 --> 16:56.040
I'm thinking Geometry Wars had, I think, a certain mode that you could only get if you

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
had both or something.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.040
Yeah.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.040
I think.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.040
Don't quote me on that.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.520
But sometimes, you know, you have those, you know, you gotta own both to get a special

17:02.520 --> 17:06.040
something or an unlock, so not too incredibly uncommon.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.640
Plus Alien Hominin and Castle Crashers, right?

17:08.640 --> 17:09.640
Yes.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.640
Get a new character if you have them both?

17:10.640 --> 17:11.640
Yeah.

17:11.640 --> 17:12.640
So.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.640
Are you looking forward to Banjo-Kazooie?

17:13.640 --> 17:14.640
You know, this is one of those games I never...

17:14.640 --> 17:15.640
I gotta be...

17:15.640 --> 17:16.640
I'm gonna be perfectly honest.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.640
I never really played Banjo-Kazooie.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.200
It was kind of during that period of my life where I wasn't playing video games a whole

17:21.200 --> 17:23.320
lot because I was in college.

17:23.320 --> 17:25.560
This is the one, one of those big series.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.200
I never owned a Nintendo 64 until years and years later.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.060
I never really played this series.

17:30.060 --> 17:34.140
But I'll check it out, especially when it's on the Live Arcade, the re-release.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.840
I'm not interested in the least.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.840
Why is that?

17:36.840 --> 17:37.840
Just never liked the first one?

17:37.840 --> 17:38.840
It's too childish for me now.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.840
Ooh.

17:39.840 --> 17:40.840
Well, it's not necessarily that.

17:40.840 --> 17:44.360
It just looks like... like a generic platformer game.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.920
And I know it's not really generic because it was probably one of the first better platformer

17:47.920 --> 17:52.120
games out there, but right now, it's not the type of game I'm into.

17:52.120 --> 18:00.320
And unfortunately, my game, you know, real estate, I guess, is too packed right now.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.880
I have too many games I have to play in a short amount of time.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.720
And Saints of R2 is gonna be coming out, and I won't give a shit about this game when Saints

18:07.720 --> 18:08.720
of R2 comes out.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.760
Kiki Nico in chat says, Rob, it's one of the best on Nintendo 64.

18:12.760 --> 18:13.760
I understand.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.760
I realize that.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.760
It's just I never got around to it.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.080
Do either of you ladies have an opinion on Banjo-Kazooie?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.200
I never liked it.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.200
Why?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.200
Same thing?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.200
You never liked Banjo-Kazooie?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
Well, no.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.040
I mean, this is also coming from the person who just, what, a couple years ago was ranting

18:26.040 --> 18:27.040
and raving about Magic Pen-Gel.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.920
Yeah, Magic Pen-Gel is fucking awesome.

18:30.920 --> 18:31.920
I still say that in the other one.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.720
With a penis monster that squirts.

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
Wow.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
We're so mature.

18:35.720 --> 18:39.440
But I just never cared for how the game plays.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.440
That's just me.

18:40.440 --> 18:46.520
I never liked the sort of... it was like, it would be more fun if it was actually side,

18:46.520 --> 18:50.480
but it was that behind view that just didn't seem very fun to me.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.480
Wow.

18:51.480 --> 18:52.480
Interesting that none of...

18:52.480 --> 18:54.320
I mean, I don't really have a hate or like opinion on it.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.120
I just flat out never really played it.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.000
Interesting, though, that overall in studio here we're negative.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.200
But to balance this out, there's positive in chat.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.800
Frisbee says Banjo-Kazooie equals heart.

19:03.800 --> 19:08.720
Kikaniko says they're not liking this BK Bash cast.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.120
I'm not bashing the game.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.080
It's just like, I don't want to play it.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.280
It just doesn't look like something I would enjoy.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.440
Here's a question I'll ask you, though, is that one place that Microsoft's really been

19:18.440 --> 19:21.240
struggling is appealing to the family demographic.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.840
They've always kind of been the hardcore gaming system.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.840
This is a lot better than Rocky and Bullwinkle or the fucking crappy SpongeBob game that

19:27.840 --> 19:28.840
they had on there.

19:28.840 --> 19:32.000
Or, wasn't there like a Shrek game on there, too?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Either way, those all sucked.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.600
I'd rather have, like, you know, you're gonna have kids playing an Xbox Live or a K-game,

19:37.600 --> 19:38.600
perfect.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.600
This would be perfect for them.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.600
Alright.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.000
Don't let them play that crappy, like, SpongeBob crap.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.080
That Rocky and Bullwinkle game was very disappointing.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.600
Especially, you know, if you love Rocky and Bullwinkle, too, it just pains you to look

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
at that game.

19:49.600 --> 19:54.960
It's just, that may have been good in, like, the 80s or earlier.

19:54.960 --> 20:01.000
I mean, it's just now, it's like they tried to bring back, what was that, the, um, what

20:01.000 --> 20:04.240
was the race game, Wacky Races.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.480
Wacky Races is great.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.360
Yeah, Wacky Races is great for the people that remember it.

20:08.360 --> 20:11.680
Kids do not know what the fuck Wacky Races is.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.760
I don't even think I know what Wacky Races is.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.720
I barely know what Wacky Races is.

20:15.720 --> 20:19.320
Wacky Races was also in the same tone as the Laugh-Olympics.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.320
Remember that?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.320
No.

20:21.320 --> 20:26.120
All the Hanna-Barbera characters in big competitions, only Wacky Races is...

20:26.120 --> 20:27.120
Oh!

20:27.120 --> 20:28.120
Okay, yes, I remember now.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.120
Okay.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.120
Okay.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.120
I personally preferred the Laugh-Olympics.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.680
It's, it's kinda like the Justice League of these types of cartoons, right?

20:33.680 --> 20:37.480
But it was all Hanna-Barbera, so you had the Great Grape Ape and...

20:37.480 --> 20:41.580
Yes, yes, yes, and, and, yeah, Huckleberry Hound and all those people were doing Battle

20:41.580 --> 20:42.580
with the Flintstones.

20:42.580 --> 20:43.580
I love Hanna-Barbera.

20:43.580 --> 20:44.580
I just didn't...

20:44.580 --> 20:46.360
Yeah, but see, that wasn't in this one, though.

20:46.360 --> 20:49.000
At least this game did not have, like, the Flintstones or anything.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Any...

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
I don't know.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Original...

20:52.000 --> 20:54.560
I think the licensing fee for a game like that would be nuts.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.080
Dark Tetsuya says there should be a Laugh-Olympics video game.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.080
I just couldn't imagine...

20:58.080 --> 20:59.080
That might be cool.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.760
But the licensing fee would be atrocious, I would think.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.640
Well, it's all Hanna-Barbera, so I would think that the Laugh-Olympics...

21:04.640 --> 21:07.640
Laugh-Olympics would probably be a lot better than Wacky Races.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.480
Wacky Races sucked, so...

21:09.480 --> 21:11.360
All right, that's that.

21:11.360 --> 21:14.800
Well, the news about Banjo-Kazooie was really big news this week, but there was other big

21:14.800 --> 21:18.440
news, especially in the legal world this week, and I'm talking about Spore.

21:18.440 --> 21:22.160
And you know, the DRM in Spore has been a very controversial point of order where, you

21:22.160 --> 21:26.920
know, you can only install the game on so many systems and, of course, secure ROM, right?

21:26.920 --> 21:31.040
Very controversial device, if you haven't heard of it, which I don't see how you could

21:31.040 --> 21:32.400
not have by now.

21:32.400 --> 21:36.680
It's that thing that kind of installs on your computer to kind of monitor what's going in

21:36.680 --> 21:37.680
the...

21:37.680 --> 21:38.680
I don't even...

21:38.680 --> 21:39.680
What is the point of secure ROM?

21:39.680 --> 21:41.640
How does it install into your computer?

21:41.640 --> 21:44.040
What exactly are they looking for?

21:44.040 --> 21:47.320
I guess to make sure you're not burning a copy of the game or something?

21:47.320 --> 21:48.720
I don't know.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.280
Well, obviously some folks are...

21:50.280 --> 21:51.720
It doesn't work very well.

21:51.720 --> 21:58.040
I mean, if I didn't want to play Spore Online, I could easily crack that stupid code with

21:58.040 --> 22:03.960
one little patch, but unfortunately I've already installed it on my system, and not that it

22:03.960 --> 22:06.800
really matters, I'm not playing the game anyway, so...

22:06.800 --> 22:07.800
Whatever.

22:07.800 --> 22:13.600
Well, a class action lawsuit has been filed against Electronic Arts this week over that

22:13.600 --> 22:16.400
DRM, and specifically kind of targeting secure ROM.

22:16.400 --> 22:20.960
This class action lawsuit is claiming that Spore contains, quote, a second undisclosed

22:20.960 --> 22:26.360
program called secure ROM, a form of digital rights management for computer games.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.880
Consumers are not warned about the program.

22:27.880 --> 22:33.160
The program installs without any notice, and they cannot uninstall the program either.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.960
The program is, quote, secretly installed at the command and control center of the computer,

22:36.960 --> 22:44.920
including zero, or the kernel, and surreptitiously operated, overseeing function and operation

22:44.920 --> 22:48.740
on the computer, preventing the computer from operating under certain circumstances and

22:48.740 --> 22:51.240
or disrupting hardware operations.

22:51.240 --> 22:55.720
So it was a class action lawsuit filed against Electronic Arts who's put this game out there

22:55.720 --> 23:01.280
basically saying, you are installing a second program without my consent on my computer.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.680
That's basically the core of it.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.680
And I agree with that.

23:04.680 --> 23:08.480
I agree that that makes sense, because they aren't saying, hey, we're installing this

23:08.480 --> 23:12.560
on here, or giving you a way to uninstall it, say, if you uninstall the game.

23:12.560 --> 23:17.000
It stays on your computer forever.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
What do you guys think?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.640
What will become of this lawsuit?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.460
And I pose this question to our chat room as well.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.180
Do you think this lawsuit has any merit?

23:23.180 --> 23:25.440
Is this a sue-happy America?

23:25.440 --> 23:27.640
What's going to happen, you think?

23:27.640 --> 23:28.640
Settlement?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.000
Any thoughts?

23:30.000 --> 23:34.440
Honestly, I think that they're going to have to settle, at least just to get people to

23:34.440 --> 23:36.240
shut up.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.760
But there's other companies have been doing this for ages.

23:39.760 --> 23:49.080
For example, I think Dell does the DNA program, I think, to see if you're, God, I can't remember

23:49.080 --> 23:52.840
what exactly it's about, but they install a program.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.380
But then again, I guess if you buy a Dell, you know you're eventually going to get this

23:55.380 --> 23:56.600
on there.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.280
But there should have, I, what?

23:59.280 --> 24:02.240
I was just going to say that probably they're not going to end up getting any money out

24:02.240 --> 24:03.240
of this.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.320
I was just going to be agreeing that, and I think this has happened in the past with

24:06.320 --> 24:11.400
other games that had secure ROM, where the agreement was that there is an uninstall program,

24:11.400 --> 24:15.280
but you have to get it from secure ROM to uninstall the game.

24:15.280 --> 24:19.200
But they keep changing the version, so it doesn't work, I don't think, anymore.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.000
I know it's not easy to uninstall it.

24:22.000 --> 24:29.440
I think that there should have been something in the manual, or maybe just like a little

24:29.440 --> 24:34.240
icon on the box that, you know, has like some sort of secure ROM logo on it or something.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.320
Something that, you know.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.000
I happen to have the box right here.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.120
Dude, I'm sorry, I just have to interrupt with something hilarious.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.720
Please, that's why you're here.

24:42.720 --> 24:48.080
I was just, like, I was reading an article about how You-Know-Who was disbarred, and

24:48.080 --> 24:54.160
somebody made a cake and wrote, Dear You-Know-Who, Congrats on the disbarment, you douchebag.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.000
Hold on, you're getting to the next story, you're getting a little ahead.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.200
That's all right.

24:58.200 --> 25:02.540
I'm looking at the box, and I'm looking at the inside of the box.

25:02.540 --> 25:05.720
It's a little, you know, what's all in the game.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.200
I'm looking at the back of the box.

25:07.200 --> 25:10.840
I'm even looking at the fine print that gives the system requirements.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.640
Internet connection is required.

25:12.640 --> 25:17.520
EA terms and conditions and feature updates can be found at www.ea.com.

25:17.520 --> 25:22.040
I don't see the word secure ROM anywhere here on this box.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.400
So they don't tell you.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.360
I honestly, I do honestly think.

25:27.360 --> 25:31.960
I mean, you know, the primary rule is let the buyer beware, but still, I think that

25:31.960 --> 25:37.040
if they are going to install something without your knowledge, when you think you're getting

25:37.040 --> 25:40.720
a game and all of a sudden you're getting, you know, this other business, even though

25:40.720 --> 25:46.440
it's to protect their information, I honestly think that there should be some sort of warning

25:46.440 --> 25:51.180
so that the buyer can be aware and not beware, you know what I mean?

25:51.180 --> 25:53.600
And not have to rely strictly on Amazon reviews.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
Exactly.

25:54.600 --> 25:59.520
The other thing too, I mean, does your copy of Warhammer have secure ROM on it, because

25:59.520 --> 26:00.520
it's also EA?

26:00.520 --> 26:01.520
Who knows?

26:01.520 --> 26:02.520
I don't know.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.520
I mean, I'm looking at the box for Warhammer, which I also happen to have right here, and

26:05.520 --> 26:09.440
I don't think I see anything on here either, but then again, would I?

26:09.440 --> 26:10.440
Probably not.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.920
Although I do notice a lot of the very same blah blah blah on here that I saw in the other

26:13.920 --> 26:14.920
box.

26:14.920 --> 26:15.920
Yeah.

26:15.920 --> 26:16.920
I don't know.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.280
I don't like the idea that, I mean, I don't have a problem with a program that's making

26:19.280 --> 26:22.400
sure my copy of the game I'm running is legit.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.920
That's fine.

26:23.920 --> 26:29.640
But the problem is, this program also is supposed to mess up your CD burning software or something

26:29.640 --> 26:30.640
like that.

26:30.640 --> 26:39.100
Luckily, it hasn't with mine, because I've been able to burn DVDs quite easy with it.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.160
You know, Jernami has a good point in our chat room.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.080
Warhammer doesn't need secure ROM.

26:43.080 --> 26:49.080
It is impossible to play, well, I mean, I guess never say never, but virtually impossible

26:49.080 --> 26:52.800
to play this game without buying your own copy, because it being an MMO, you have to

26:52.800 --> 26:58.240
have a key to go online and play the game, and it needs an internet connection by nature,

26:58.240 --> 26:59.240
so it's very easily verifiable.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.320
It doesn't matter.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
It's a game.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.320
It's a cop.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.960
I mean, they do that with Final Fantasy XI.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.800
You have to have a copy, you know, a content code or something like that to prove that

27:08.800 --> 27:14.080
you bought the game, so I don't know.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.520
Tigerclaw asked, did the end user license agreement state anything about copy protection?

27:17.520 --> 27:19.120
It may not mention about secure ROM.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.040
22 Tigerclaw said it did not.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.040
Hmm, interesting.

27:22.040 --> 27:25.920
Even if it did, I think they might have a claim that it's not visible enough.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.440
You know, how many people really read those end user license agreements?

27:28.440 --> 27:29.440
I don't know.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.440
Who knows?

27:30.440 --> 27:34.840
Bobby says he has, Bobby Blackwolf, our buddy before us here on All Games Radio, says the

27:34.840 --> 27:37.680
Galactic Edition box also does not state secure ROM.

27:37.680 --> 27:41.120
He has the special edition.

27:41.120 --> 27:45.000
Let's see, Frisbee says people actually checked the end user license agreement and never saw

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
secure ROM.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.400
Frisbee had another really good point here earlier.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.760
I'm trying to find it.

27:50.760 --> 27:54.760
You have to tell people when you install stuff in a PC, it's an invasion of piracy.

27:54.760 --> 27:58.720
Tigerclaw also says this, I hope this lawsuit goes through because digital rights management

27:58.720 --> 28:00.040
is bad enough as it is.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.160
I wonder though, when you install the game, there's probably an end user, and that's where

28:03.160 --> 28:05.520
that second discussion went on.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.520
It's spyware.

28:06.520 --> 28:12.000
It's a spyware or trojan, basically, because it's a program that's being installed without

28:12.000 --> 28:15.360
you knowing, and that is just not right.

28:15.360 --> 28:20.680
Do you remember years ago when CDs, I believe it was Sony, question mark, that they're

28:20.680 --> 28:21.680
very rootkit.

28:21.680 --> 28:22.680
That's it.

28:22.680 --> 28:23.680
Rootkit was what it was called.

28:23.680 --> 28:29.560
There was a big stink over that, and they had to end up either replacing disks or something,

28:29.560 --> 28:30.560
wasn't it?

28:30.560 --> 28:34.240
Well, they had to put an uninstall program out there for this, and people found out you

28:34.240 --> 28:39.160
could get around this by drawing a line with a Sharpie pen on your disk to basically fuck

28:39.160 --> 28:42.640
up the data track on your CD, because data tracks go at the end.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.520
It's a little different, I guess.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.360
Yeah, but here's the crazy thing about that.

28:46.360 --> 28:49.400
I was actually reading about rootkit on Wikipedia not that long ago.

28:49.400 --> 28:55.080
Did you know that not only could you go to the website to get the program, the Windows

28:55.080 --> 28:56.080
official...

28:56.080 --> 28:59.360
You know how Windows has their own spyware removal program or whatever that comes out

28:59.360 --> 29:00.360
every month?

29:00.360 --> 29:02.200
Sometimes you see it in Windows Update.

29:02.200 --> 29:07.160
The rootkit removal ended up being a part of that months later, so I just always thought

29:07.160 --> 29:09.760
that was kind of fascinating.

29:09.760 --> 29:15.240
Very interesting, and yeah, Game Guru says it's a rootkit, and no one warned it.

29:15.240 --> 29:18.040
I'm wondering if this is going to go along the same route.

29:18.040 --> 29:22.200
To me, that rootkit thing kind of set a precedent in this regard.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.440
That's where I think that, yeah, this might be justified because you're installing extra

29:25.440 --> 29:27.440
shit that someone didn't ask for.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.440
So...

29:28.440 --> 29:34.760
Well, if they're going to follow by previous, because I do believe that, isn't it, once

29:34.760 --> 29:40.440
it hits the federal level, if it's gone through court, what, at least three times, that it

29:40.440 --> 29:43.080
becomes a basically, oh, God, I can't remember.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.080
I took that law class a long time ago.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.520
I'll get what you're saying, though.

29:46.520 --> 29:52.640
But usually, if there's been a prior precedent set for it, they tend to stick by previous

29:52.640 --> 29:53.640
rulings.

29:53.640 --> 29:54.640
All right.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.400
Well, if you have some thoughts on this, you can join us in our chat room, or you can always

29:57.400 --> 29:58.400
send us an email.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.400
Mailbagorangelawnatradio.com.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.560
And we'll let Rob read it.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.760
All right.

30:03.760 --> 30:04.760
Let's move on with the news.

30:04.760 --> 30:09.320
I know Tiara gave us a hint of what's to come, but please, Dark Soccer, give us the wonderful,

30:09.320 --> 30:10.880
glorious news that happened this week.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.960
In baking news, there's been cakes made regarding...

30:13.960 --> 30:14.960
No.

30:14.960 --> 30:23.600
Well, as stated by Sauce earlier, we have no more of he-who-shall-not-be-named practicing

30:23.600 --> 30:24.600
law.

30:24.600 --> 30:29.320
He has been permanently disbarred, and he's already throwing a hissy fit.

30:29.320 --> 30:35.720
And going, wah, over the whole thing.

30:35.720 --> 30:41.160
He's basically saying that it's a retaliation for a book he wrote about the Florida Supreme

30:41.160 --> 30:56.720
Court trying to get past this faith-based activism against the American entertainment

30:56.720 --> 30:57.720
industry.

30:57.720 --> 31:02.360
He's quoted as saying this rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal

31:02.360 --> 31:09.960
suit with enemies this foolish Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has.

31:09.960 --> 31:10.960
That's his statement.

31:10.960 --> 31:11.960
I love this.

31:11.960 --> 31:16.320
Act Deaf in Chat is suggesting that we shall change the name from he-who-shall-not-be-named

31:16.320 --> 31:19.560
to he-who-shall-not-practice law.

31:19.560 --> 31:20.680
I endorse this.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.320
I endorse it as well.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.320
Loki?

31:23.320 --> 31:24.320
I'm fine with that.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.320
All right.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.320
There it is.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.320
His new name is...

31:27.320 --> 31:28.320
I just hope we don't have to talk to him anymore.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.320
He-who-shall-not-practice law.

31:29.320 --> 31:32.040
I know it is getting a little old, isn't it?

31:32.040 --> 31:33.040
Yeah.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.040
It's already been.

31:34.040 --> 31:37.040
It was a little old a long time ago.

31:37.040 --> 31:41.680
Just though, and this is what I was saying when Bobby made his call to us earlier, is,

31:41.680 --> 31:48.280
I mean, keep in mind, this is the same guy who went after Two Life Crew back in the day,

31:48.280 --> 31:54.200
went after Ice-T for his cop-killer thing, and basically, as far as I'm concerned, this

31:54.200 --> 31:56.040
man is anti-First Amendment.

31:56.040 --> 32:00.280
You know what he needs to refocus his efforts on?

32:00.280 --> 32:06.000
Like reality TV shows that appear on MTV, like The Real World and The Hills, those need

32:06.000 --> 32:08.400
to be taken off TV.

32:08.400 --> 32:12.560
Even more, though, going back to what I was trying to say about, I don't think he's specifically

32:12.560 --> 32:14.400
anti-First Amendment.

32:14.400 --> 32:20.760
He's pro-First Amendment as long as it's whatever he wants to say, you know?

32:20.760 --> 32:25.800
As long as it's his personal agenda, which actually, I don't even know so much that it's

32:25.800 --> 32:30.080
his own personal agenda as much as it's something that he found out that he can make money on.

32:30.080 --> 32:34.400
In other words, it's kind of like, here, and here's a visual for you, Justin TV folks.

32:34.400 --> 32:41.680
Here's he who shall not practice law, and here's the world revolving around him in his

32:41.680 --> 32:42.680
mind.

32:42.680 --> 32:43.680
Exactly.

32:43.680 --> 32:50.600
I'm actually, like I was saying earlier, I think this is a long time coming ever since,

32:50.600 --> 32:52.800
you know, the late 80s.

32:52.800 --> 32:57.360
God, what is this now, 20 years this has been coming?

32:57.360 --> 33:04.840
I'm finally glad to see, you know, basically the duct tape thrown over his mouth and, you

33:04.840 --> 33:09.600
know, hopefully he'll stop bitching and realize that no one really cares.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.600
Maybe he'll take up knitting.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.600
Huh?

33:11.600 --> 33:12.600
We'll see.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.600
I said maybe he'll take up knitting.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.600
We'll see.

33:14.600 --> 33:23.640
He'd be, you know, knitting, I guess, restraints for people that he thinks offends him or something.

33:23.640 --> 33:27.840
The ex Jason XV says, Dark Sakura, people need to learn to be offended.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.680
Exactly.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.680
Including this guy.

33:30.680 --> 33:34.000
I suppose this is the biggest offense ever, huh?

33:34.000 --> 33:42.400
He's like, the Florida people don't like me because I wrote a mean book about them.

33:42.400 --> 33:48.120
No, they disbarred you because you're a big fucking moron.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.120
The end.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.880
Well, you know what?

33:50.880 --> 33:52.560
I know it's a little early.

33:52.560 --> 33:56.820
We usually don't get to this segment this early in the show, but you know, usually whenever

33:56.820 --> 34:02.320
we bring up a story about he who shall not practice law on this program, it's immediately

34:02.320 --> 34:05.440
followed by a very regular segment of ours.

34:05.440 --> 34:11.520
One last time, seeing as hopefully, hopefully we'll never have a story about this guy again,

34:11.520 --> 34:31.600
for real real, one more time, the FUs of the week, as inspired by a story about this guy.

34:31.600 --> 34:38.960
I have a multiple part FU, and it begins with a certain event that occurred on Tuesday.

34:38.960 --> 34:45.680
On Tuesday, I was driving school, mining my own and paying attention to the road and then

34:45.680 --> 34:47.840
crash.

34:47.840 --> 34:54.760
The silver Lancer of love is now the totaled out silver Lancer of death.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.760
It is gone.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.760
R.I.P.

34:56.760 --> 34:57.760
Lancer.

34:57.760 --> 34:58.760
My baby.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.760
My poor, poor baby.

34:59.760 --> 35:05.000
Um, however, um, yeah, and I did actually end up hurting my hip kind of bad.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.320
I've been kind of limping about, um, but I'm going to see my craft director next week,

35:08.320 --> 35:09.960
which is Poppy.

35:09.960 --> 35:18.840
And then as my week progresses, Dan ends up going into the hospital for, I had to spend

35:18.840 --> 35:25.480
like what, three, four hours in the ER with Dan with his knee being sprained.

35:25.480 --> 35:31.600
So it just, it was just sort of one thing after another, but everything was happy when

35:31.600 --> 35:34.160
I went to the airport and picked up sauce.

35:34.160 --> 35:40.080
It's been great, except for this morning when I had to spend four hours, the car dealership

35:40.080 --> 35:44.280
signing papers and it was the signing papers part that took longer than the test driving

35:44.280 --> 35:45.280
part.

35:45.280 --> 35:53.580
However, I now have, um, a happy, um, Toyota vibe as in matrix with a Pontiac exterior.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.480
Now the big question is what are you going to name it?

35:55.480 --> 35:57.360
Cause your last car was Vic Viper, right?

35:57.360 --> 36:02.640
Well, my last car, piano last car wasn't Vic Viper and the one before that was the Twendy.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.000
So what's this one going to be now?

36:04.000 --> 36:09.320
Whatever the ship in our type is, Dan suggested that it should be Raider.

36:09.320 --> 36:16.480
That way she would have a Toyota or Pontiac vibrator.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.160
I get it.

36:18.160 --> 36:22.480
Maybe that'll be it's, it's a, it's secrets, but I'm, it's not Lord British cause it's

36:22.480 --> 36:23.480
not red.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.520
Dan pointed that out to me cause I was going to name it Lord British.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.520
Nice.

36:26.520 --> 36:32.380
You know, one letter, if you named it ribbon, it'd be one letter away from Vib ribbon.

36:32.380 --> 36:36.300
All right, you shouldn't name it.

36:36.300 --> 36:42.380
I know what, what was, um, I'll name it, um, Mojib ribbon cause my car is kind of beige

36:42.380 --> 36:46.640
and all of Mojib ribbon was parchment colored.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.640
I don't know.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.600
I like, it's the trans vibrator.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.600
There we go.

36:50.600 --> 36:51.600
Thank you.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.600
Act of death.

36:52.600 --> 36:53.600
It's the chance.

36:53.600 --> 36:54.600
The trans vibrator.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.400
My car's name is rez.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.400
Your car's name is rez.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.400
My car's name is rez.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.400
All right.

36:59.400 --> 37:03.520
That's the second thing Act F's contributed tonight.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.800
That's pretty big.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.800
Two pretty big deals.

37:05.800 --> 37:06.840
Add it on the Wiki.

37:06.840 --> 37:07.840
My car has a name.

37:07.840 --> 37:08.840
All right.

37:08.840 --> 37:09.840
There you go.

37:09.840 --> 37:18.400
Uh, Loki, your FUs of the week, uh, my FU week goes to, uh, your aunt and, um, they're

37:18.400 --> 37:19.400
annoying.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.400
Hey, what did my aunt do to you?

37:20.400 --> 37:22.760
She's sitting in a house in the middle of Elk Grove somewhere.

37:22.760 --> 37:23.760
Just tend into the pigs.

37:23.760 --> 37:27.920
Hey, well that aunt's fine, but the other hundred that you have underneath this floor

37:27.920 --> 37:29.720
here that kind of sucked.

37:29.720 --> 37:34.520
I put the food or I should say the trash next to the mixing board.

37:34.520 --> 37:39.520
So if the sound starts to go out and we notice a big hoard of ants, we'll know why.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.520
All right.

37:40.520 --> 37:47.600
Uh, my FU of the week goes to my gallbladder because it sucks and it's like, I don't like

37:47.600 --> 37:48.600
you Rob.

37:48.600 --> 37:53.960
I'm going to get all inflaming and stuff inside you and you're going to have to have a surgery

37:53.960 --> 37:54.960
to take me out.

37:54.960 --> 37:55.960
Thankfully.

37:55.960 --> 37:56.960
Gallbladder surgery is no big deal.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.760
I've had plenty of people reassure me it's not a big deal.

37:59.760 --> 38:04.960
It's just, you know, just the method of it all and having to get all the pre screenings

38:04.960 --> 38:09.520
and having to go through, I'm going to be in bed for two weeks, which is going to suck

38:09.520 --> 38:13.600
because I won't be able to do the show among other things, but I should be able to get

38:13.600 --> 38:17.080
a whole lot of DS playing in at that time because you'll notice I haven't reviewed a

38:17.080 --> 38:21.480
DS game on this program in like six months, so that's going to be the blessing about gallbladder

38:21.480 --> 38:24.640
surgery is dammit, I'm going to catch up on every single handheld game I've been waiting

38:24.640 --> 38:27.780
to catch up on in a long freaking time.

38:27.780 --> 38:32.520
So if you do the gallbladder for hating me, sadly enough, Rob's gallbladder is easier

38:32.520 --> 38:34.760
to remove and secure off.

38:34.760 --> 38:39.960
You've been sitting here all night long with that punchline, haven't you?

38:39.960 --> 38:41.960
You've been waiting just the last minute.

38:41.960 --> 38:42.960
Asshole.

38:42.960 --> 38:43.960
All right.

38:43.960 --> 38:46.400
Tara, do you have any FUs of the week?

38:46.400 --> 38:50.840
I would just like to say to Drew that you suck for not coming to my brunch yesterday.

38:50.840 --> 38:55.560
So FU, Drew, for ruining my vacation by being a loser and not showing up.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.560
Aww.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.560
How sad.

38:57.560 --> 38:58.560
All right.

38:58.560 --> 39:05.120
There you go, FUs of the week.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.400
Nate432 says, Rob, you need to give the PSP some more love.

39:08.400 --> 39:11.000
I do love the PSP, and you know I'm going to love it a whole lot more when it's the

39:11.000 --> 39:13.440
only way I can watch movies for a couple weeks.

39:13.440 --> 39:17.920
So hey, PSP is the perfect post-surgery device.

39:17.920 --> 39:18.920
There you go.

39:18.920 --> 39:19.920
How's that?

39:19.920 --> 39:20.920
Fantastic.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.280
New games all in one.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.280
There's your PSP love.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.280
All right.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.280
All right.

39:26.280 --> 39:30.360
Securom is the new Gator, says Jirnami.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.360
Remember Gator?

39:31.360 --> 39:32.360
Yeah, I remember Gator.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.360
Good stuff.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.360
Gator sucked.

39:34.360 --> 39:35.360
Gator doesn't.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.360
What ever happened to Gator?

39:36.360 --> 39:37.360
It's probably still around.

39:37.360 --> 39:38.600
I'm going to look that up on Wikipedia right now.

39:38.600 --> 39:39.600
All right.

39:39.600 --> 39:40.600
Meanwhile, another story.

39:40.600 --> 39:47.800
Meanwhile, tomorrow or today or whenever you're having a listen to this, Monday, September

39:47.800 --> 39:55.600
29th, Xbox Live Arcade will be, or Xbox Live completely, will be down the entire day.

39:55.600 --> 40:06.880
24 hours so that they can do some necessary improvements to prep for the next Xbox experience,

40:06.880 --> 40:13.640
or new Xbox experience, with all the fancy avatars and other crap that they're adding

40:13.640 --> 40:14.640
to it.

40:14.640 --> 40:19.280
So that's not the day that it's coming out, but it will be the day that they're working

40:19.280 --> 40:20.280
on stuff.

40:20.280 --> 40:26.720
So you'll have to find some offline games to play during that time.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.960
Wow.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.760
This is crazy that Gator got brought up tonight.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.720
There's actually some very recent news about Gator.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.080
I'm reading here on Wikipedia.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.080
Okay.

40:36.080 --> 40:39.760
Gator was run by a company called the Claria Corporation, was the people behind Gator.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.400
And there was a whole lot of back and forth.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.640
You know, there was that Gator.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.680
And to make a long story short, Gator was like some freaking program that installed

40:45.680 --> 40:48.920
itself on your computer, basically, that would just pop ads up all over.

40:48.920 --> 40:52.080
Like wasn't that stupid weather bug thing part of this?

40:52.080 --> 40:55.680
Like they would try to give you some dumb little program that would sneak Gator on there

40:55.680 --> 40:56.680
as part of it.

40:56.680 --> 40:57.920
Well, yeah, that was it.

40:57.920 --> 41:01.200
It was no weather scope, precision time.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.200
That was it.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.520
Is the time on your computer accurate?

41:04.520 --> 41:06.840
That was their big thing.

41:06.840 --> 41:07.840
Okay.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.080
Well, here's the thing.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.480
You know, there was this all back and forth stuff.

41:11.480 --> 41:16.640
In 2006, Claria said they were going to exit the adware business and focus on search technology.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.120
Well, here's the thing.

41:18.120 --> 41:25.080
September 26, 2008, two days ago, Jelly Cloud, which is what Claria changed its name to in

41:25.080 --> 41:30.880
June, has laid off all its employees, shut down all operations, and has liquidated all

41:30.880 --> 41:31.880
assets.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.960
So, Gator officially bid it this week.

41:34.960 --> 41:39.160
How do you like that for like late breaking news?

41:39.160 --> 41:43.040
And I would have never known if we didn't joke about it on tonight's show.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.760
So Xbox Live down for a full day, really?

41:44.760 --> 41:45.760
Yeah.

41:45.760 --> 41:48.240
I had to make the preparations last week.

41:48.240 --> 41:55.300
So we're ready to go back to playing System Link Saints Row 1.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.520
That's what we're going to do on Monday.

41:57.520 --> 42:00.480
I have to go a full day without Rock Band?

42:00.480 --> 42:02.200
What am I going to do?

42:02.200 --> 42:03.200
I'm just kidding.

42:03.200 --> 42:06.120
Is Xbox Live going down a whole day really that big a deal?

42:06.120 --> 42:07.120
I don't think so.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.840
It won't be the end of the world.

42:09.840 --> 42:14.080
It is a big deal if you happen to, I don't know, have a new system that requires you

42:14.080 --> 42:21.240
to be logged into Xbox Live so that it knows that you purchased certain things.

42:21.240 --> 42:25.400
Otherwise they show up as demos or just don't work.

42:25.400 --> 42:33.760
Oh yeah, that'll be bad for those folks that haven't done the resetting of their licenses

42:33.760 --> 42:34.760
and all that stuff.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.280
Yeah, let's play more Mercenaries 2.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.280
All right.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.760
And watch Heroes.

42:38.760 --> 42:43.440
You know, one thing that also can happen when Xbox Live is down is that your games can patch.

42:43.440 --> 42:48.860
And I don't know if you guys have heard about this, but Fable 2 is coming out very soon.

42:48.860 --> 42:54.160
And Fable 2 is actually going to be having no co-op the day it launches, which is kind

42:54.160 --> 42:55.160
of interesting.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.560
They're going to have to patch it into the game.

42:56.560 --> 43:00.120
They say they're going to do it a week after the release, but it's actually not going to

43:00.120 --> 43:01.120
be in the game.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.340
And for those of you guys that listen to Bobby Black Wolf Show, who he's on right before

43:04.340 --> 43:08.040
us on AllGames.com, we actually talked about this at length in the Tossover segment at

43:08.040 --> 43:09.960
the end of his show this week.

43:09.960 --> 43:15.240
But in a nutshell, one thing I suggested is that reviewers should simply not review the

43:15.240 --> 43:18.960
co-op part of the game because it's not a part of the game at its release.

43:18.960 --> 43:23.000
But it's a very tricky area right now because there really is no kind of ethical standard

43:23.000 --> 43:26.440
set as to what should and should not be in the game when it's released.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.400
MMOs, they're always constantly patching.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.080
Look at a game like Burnout Paradise.

43:31.080 --> 43:35.080
Burnout Paradise has kind of reinvented itself several times since the game launched, and

43:35.080 --> 43:36.640
that's been overall a good thing.

43:36.640 --> 43:39.680
But at the same time, Burnout Paradise didn't advertise that motorbikes were going to be

43:39.680 --> 43:40.880
in the game before its release.

43:40.880 --> 43:41.880
That was kind of an added bonus.

43:41.880 --> 43:42.880
Yes.

43:42.880 --> 43:43.880
Loki, what do you think?

43:43.880 --> 43:46.360
Because I think you got in late and you didn't get to give your opinion on that on Bobby

43:46.360 --> 43:47.360
Show.

43:47.360 --> 43:52.080
Well, I think it's just retarded that games come out nowadays and require patching out

43:52.080 --> 43:56.000
the door or patching weeks later because they're not done.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.200
That would be like saying, oh, hey, you know that movie that came out?

43:59.200 --> 44:00.840
You're going to go to theaters and see it?

44:00.840 --> 44:02.880
Yeah, we're going to patch in the ending later.

44:02.880 --> 44:08.880
I mean, it's just getting to the point now where developers don't need to finish their

44:08.880 --> 44:12.720
product before it hits the market because they want to get it out at a certain time.

44:12.720 --> 44:16.200
Well, you know, if you want to get it at a certain time, maybe you should have worked

44:16.200 --> 44:17.200
harder.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.800
Well, here's a thought.

44:18.800 --> 44:22.800
If they had never teased this as being an element of the game, I...

44:22.800 --> 44:25.280
It would have looked really awesome.

44:25.280 --> 44:28.240
It would have looked really awesome when it finally came out.

44:28.240 --> 44:33.200
So in a way, I think the lesson to be learned here is don't tempt us with things that you're

44:33.200 --> 44:36.400
not going to be able to, because this is the kind of stories that are going to happen,

44:36.400 --> 44:37.400
you know?

44:37.400 --> 44:38.720
Otherwise, people would have been none the wiser.

44:38.720 --> 44:42.080
I bet you there still would have been a lot of anticipation over Fable 2 because, you

44:42.080 --> 44:45.400
know, Fable did have its fans on Xbox One, you know?

44:45.400 --> 44:48.520
So just kind of a lesson to be learned, I suppose.

44:48.520 --> 44:52.360
But still, at least they are patching it that soon.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.360
At least it's not coming like a year later.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.360
We hope.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.360
This is in theory.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.360
Yeah.

44:57.360 --> 45:02.120
I mean, there are a lot of games that are put out by certain companies like EA that

45:02.120 --> 45:07.320
come out flawed and patches don't come that quick at all.

45:07.320 --> 45:12.560
And I find it hard to believe that, oops, we just didn't catch some of these bugs, Mercenaries

45:12.560 --> 45:14.880
2.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.440
It's just... it's lazy.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.440
It really is.

45:18.440 --> 45:19.960
Let's cut costs with QA.

45:19.960 --> 45:20.960
How about that?

45:20.960 --> 45:21.960
All right.

45:21.960 --> 45:24.880
Well, unfortunately, because online co-op is not in the game when it launches, some

45:24.880 --> 45:28.280
of the achievements might be a little harder to get, which is also very interesting about

45:28.280 --> 45:29.800
the achievements in Fable 2.

45:29.800 --> 45:34.980
Most of them you can either do yourself or watch someone else do, and it will unlock

45:34.980 --> 45:35.980
the achievement.

45:35.980 --> 45:40.240
For example, there's an achievement worth 10 points in the game called the romantic.

45:40.240 --> 45:46.020
Take a villager on a perfect date or tag along to one, meaning that it looks like most achievements

45:46.020 --> 45:50.520
will be obtainable in co-op modes as well, which is kind of interesting because, you

45:50.520 --> 45:53.980
know, is that part of the programming where I guess once the trigger's hit, it's hit no

45:53.980 --> 45:58.680
matter who did it, or was that something that was always intended to try and get more people

45:58.680 --> 46:03.300
to play the game together or whatever?

46:03.300 --> 46:04.960
Kind of interesting, I suppose.

46:04.960 --> 46:08.120
It'll make it a little easier to actually get all the achievements, and it should be

46:08.120 --> 46:14.320
noted, not all of them can you do with another person as well, but a good chunk of them can

46:14.320 --> 46:18.400
be done co-op or single player mode, which is kind of interesting.

46:18.400 --> 46:24.880
Fable 2, despite all the blah blah blah about the online co-op, I'll probably still get

46:24.880 --> 46:25.880
the game when it comes out.

46:25.880 --> 46:26.880
I actually enjoyed the first game.

46:26.880 --> 46:31.160
I had fun with it, so I'm looking forward to the second game as well.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.440
Quick comments from chat room.

46:32.440 --> 46:35.240
There's quite a few comments coming in here.

46:35.240 --> 46:38.400
Bobby Blackwell says, I've never heard of a movie being taken out of the theaters to

46:38.400 --> 46:40.360
be given a new ending and put back in theaters.

46:40.360 --> 46:41.360
Wait, wait, wait.

46:41.360 --> 46:42.360
I have.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.360
I have.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.360
28 Days Later.

46:44.360 --> 46:45.360
Remember?

46:45.360 --> 46:47.920
They re-released it with like the additional ending or the special ending?

46:47.920 --> 46:48.920
Yeah.

46:48.920 --> 46:49.920
Sometimes they do.

46:49.920 --> 46:50.920
I mean, you know, I get the point.

46:50.920 --> 46:54.080
I think he's trying to say that you're doing an apples and oranges thing with that comparison,

46:54.080 --> 46:57.920
but they do sometimes re-release movies with extra crap to try and get people to go see

46:57.920 --> 46:58.920
it a second time.

46:58.920 --> 47:01.360
Or completely change it all around, thank you George Lucas.

47:01.360 --> 47:04.400
But I guess that's true.

47:04.400 --> 47:05.400
Let's see.

47:05.400 --> 47:09.200
Gerardo says, but are people really not going to play Fable 2 because there's no co-op in

47:09.200 --> 47:10.200
it?

47:10.200 --> 47:11.200
No.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.200
I think not.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.200
It's still Fable.

47:13.200 --> 47:14.200
I think at the end of the day, he's right.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.200
You're right.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.040
Anybody that was going to buy the game is still going to buy it because they know it

47:18.040 --> 47:19.040
is coming.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.280
And anybody that wasn't going to buy the game is just going to throw this onto the list

47:21.280 --> 47:22.280
of what they don't like.

47:22.280 --> 47:25.600
Hey, at least they came out and said that the online co-op isn't in there instead of

47:25.600 --> 47:29.680
releasing it with the online co-op and it doesn't work and then go, oops, we got to

47:29.680 --> 47:30.680
patch it later.

47:30.680 --> 47:31.680
True.

47:31.680 --> 47:32.680
So.

47:32.680 --> 47:33.680
Very true.

47:33.680 --> 47:34.680
Yeah.

47:34.680 --> 47:37.400
So, you know, honestly, at the end of the day, is this going to change anything about

47:37.400 --> 47:38.400
Fable 2?

47:38.400 --> 47:39.400
Probably not.

47:39.400 --> 47:40.400
Probably not.

47:40.400 --> 47:44.100
But will this maybe set a really bad precedent?

47:44.100 --> 47:45.100
That's what we're all kind of...

47:45.100 --> 47:46.200
I don't think so.

47:46.200 --> 47:48.600
The precedent's already been set a long time ago.

47:48.600 --> 47:52.960
I mean, now that we have consoles that can patch games, that doesn't mean that the game

47:52.960 --> 47:55.480
has to come out perfect.

47:55.480 --> 47:59.200
And not that it really mattered before that either, so.

47:59.200 --> 48:05.020
But I don't know if you noticed, but a lot of the games that came out before the 360

48:05.020 --> 48:10.240
and stuff like that, there weren't as many glitches and problems because they spent

48:10.240 --> 48:13.440
more time testing them and making sure that they worked right.

48:13.440 --> 48:17.840
And now it doesn't matter because if people discover glitches later on, eh, we'll just

48:17.840 --> 48:20.080
go and fix it.

48:20.080 --> 48:23.980
I think that's kind of lazy and it kind of sucks that you buy a product and it doesn't

48:23.980 --> 48:28.840
work correctly because of sheer laziness.

48:28.840 --> 48:31.820
Sounds like there will be a lot of people that want to call in and talk about this later.

48:31.820 --> 48:33.440
We got to keep it moving, though.

48:33.440 --> 48:37.960
We're getting into the show here and we got a lot of stories to still cover, like whatever

48:37.960 --> 48:39.680
Dark Soccer's going to talk about next.

48:39.680 --> 48:45.320
Well, it looks like, you know how people were saying that the 360 wasn't necessarily so

48:45.320 --> 48:50.940
popular in Japan, but it looks like it's overtook the PS3, actually, again.

48:50.940 --> 49:01.340
With the recent price cut, it went down, it actually managed to get out 13,777 units as

49:01.340 --> 49:05.520
opposed to PS3's 8,156.

49:05.520 --> 49:09.880
So it's seriously giving it the smackdown.

49:09.880 --> 49:17.680
However, in software titles, it's still basically in Nintendo's pocket.

49:17.680 --> 49:22.680
For software, Pokemon Platinum is the top seller, then Dragon Ball Origins, Rythmton

49:22.680 --> 49:30.960
Goku Gold, and yeah, the top three are all DS games, followed by Trusty Bell's Chopin's

49:30.960 --> 49:35.160
Dream on PS3, the reprise.

49:35.160 --> 49:41.880
So Microsoft really needs to be praising whatever deity they believe in for Tales of Vesperia

49:41.880 --> 49:43.040
right about now, right?

49:43.040 --> 49:44.040
Pretty much.

49:44.040 --> 49:49.080
Well, following down even the next two games after that are more Nintendo games, Quiz Magic

49:49.080 --> 49:53.280
Academy DS and Wii Fit are 5 and 6, respectively.

49:53.280 --> 50:01.020
7 is a Katekyo Hitman Reborn Battle Arena on PSP, 8 is with Samurai Portable PSP, 9

50:01.020 --> 50:04.440
One Piece Unlimited Cruise on Wii, and then Mario Kart Wii.

50:04.440 --> 50:12.880
So it's very much dominated by Nintendo, but as far as hardware sales, number one is the

50:12.880 --> 50:19.300
DS, 2 is the Wii, 3 is PSP, 4 is Xbox 360, 5 is PS3, and 6 is PS2, which is actually

50:19.300 --> 50:24.800
still impressive, selling over 7,000 units.

50:24.800 --> 50:28.040
Interesting comment from chat, and I apologize in advance for horribly mispronouncing your

50:28.040 --> 50:29.760
name, which I'm sure I'm going to do.

50:29.760 --> 50:35.600
Nefestus says, I love the fact that 360 outselling PS3 in Japan for a week is news.

50:35.600 --> 50:37.440
It kind of is, in a way.

50:37.440 --> 50:43.000
I mean, it really is that, wow, the 360, because a lot of folks say, oh, Xbox is failing in

50:43.000 --> 50:46.800
Japan, Microsoft is failing, they don't know what they're doing, da da da, or that it's

50:46.800 --> 50:47.800
never going to sell in Japan.

50:47.800 --> 50:52.800
And then finally, it takes one really, really good game for that audience to really start

50:52.800 --> 50:53.800
moving these systems.

50:53.800 --> 50:59.380
And it is, the turnaround is somewhat, it's somewhat notable.

50:59.380 --> 51:03.460
This is, the question is, will it have momentum, or is this just going to be a one hit, one

51:03.460 --> 51:04.460
trick pony?

51:04.460 --> 51:11.160
Well, still though, I mean, that's more than twice as many units that went out, so.

51:11.160 --> 51:18.720
I want to say that perhaps if, you know, if basically, it does have to do with Squeenix

51:18.720 --> 51:26.540
support, if I think that they might put the effort into trying to get more of those major

51:26.540 --> 51:30.700
party developers, at least for the Japanese market, to try to get more things on their

51:30.700 --> 51:34.600
systems, you know, that might help them out in the long run if they can keep that kind

51:34.600 --> 51:35.600
of support.

51:35.600 --> 51:40.240
Yeah, if only they can, I think they need to throw a lot of money at Capcom to get the

51:40.240 --> 51:45.640
next, like, another Monster Hunter game, exclusive for the 360, that'll sell plenty of systems.

51:45.640 --> 51:48.080
Or Fire Emblem.

51:48.080 --> 51:50.800
Fire Emblem will never be on that system.

51:50.800 --> 51:54.120
I mean, not Fire Emblem, yep.

51:54.120 --> 51:55.120
Because that's a Nintendo title.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.120
I don't know what I was thinking.

51:56.120 --> 51:57.120
Actually, what you were saying, so.

51:57.120 --> 51:58.120
Let's get the name mixed up.

51:58.120 --> 51:59.120
Alright.

51:59.120 --> 52:00.120
Alright, let's move on.

52:00.120 --> 52:11.280
Let's see here, this week there was an interesting countdown done by Bungie on the anniversary

52:11.280 --> 52:19.360
of Halo 3, and kind of went back to the whole E3 announcement, or that never really happened,

52:19.360 --> 52:27.920
and what we got after the countdown was done is a teaser for a Halo 3 campaign expansion.

52:27.920 --> 52:35.160
And we know this because on Xbox Live, the description for the video that's on there

52:35.160 --> 52:39.840
is a new Halo 3 campaign experience.

52:39.840 --> 52:45.160
But what exactly this experience will be, who knows.

52:45.160 --> 52:50.720
The thoughts are it's not going to be Master Chief as the main character, and actually

52:50.720 --> 52:55.280
they have a whole bunch of breakdown on the trailer and stuff.

52:55.280 --> 53:01.280
I know on Xbox, was it on 360, Fanboy, they had a pretty cool video breakdown there.

53:01.280 --> 53:03.760
Obsessive fans analyzing each and every frame.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.760
I know.

53:04.760 --> 53:05.760
Awesome.

53:05.760 --> 53:08.680
And then of course, along with analyzing every single frame, they thought that they found

53:08.680 --> 53:15.600
a date within the movie itself, and of course it was January 6, 09, which would be a Tuesday.

53:15.600 --> 53:21.680
So this might be possibly coming in January, I guess we'll have to see, but that's kind

53:21.680 --> 53:22.680
of exciting.

53:22.680 --> 53:27.240
At least they're going to be expanding the game some, in case it's gotten a little stale.

53:27.240 --> 53:29.280
Free expansion, hopefully?

53:29.280 --> 53:35.560
I don't think so, but I think this is actually kind of like the night, not the nights of

53:35.560 --> 53:39.120
the game, but like Shivering Isles or something like that, something of that size, because

53:39.120 --> 53:40.760
it's a whole new portion of the game.

53:40.760 --> 53:44.040
That's kind of neat to see something like that in a non-RPG type game, though.

53:44.040 --> 53:48.200
So it's kind of neat to see the extended life of the game, but something that should have

53:48.200 --> 53:50.840
been there to begin with, maybe?

53:50.840 --> 53:51.840
I don't think so.

53:51.840 --> 53:54.480
Because we were talking about things that come out long after the game's out.

53:54.480 --> 53:57.360
No, I don't think so, because this doesn't really tie in with the whole storyline of

53:57.360 --> 54:01.920
Halo 3, it's kind of something on top of it that's running in the Halo engine now.

54:01.920 --> 54:06.800
And that maybe is a little bit of backstory in-between Halo 2 and 3 or something?

54:06.800 --> 54:07.800
I don't know.

54:07.800 --> 54:13.200
To be honest, I've played Halo 2 a little bit, and Halo 1 multiplayer a little bit,

54:13.200 --> 54:16.480
but I never really actually played through the storylines of those.

54:16.480 --> 54:21.240
So I couldn't really tell you what the hell was going on in the trailers, but it looked

54:21.240 --> 54:22.240
cool.

54:22.240 --> 54:27.640
And it's interesting, I mean this will probably mean a lot more to a Halo fan.

54:27.640 --> 54:31.640
Alright well moving on in other kind of Halo related news, you might remember a few weeks

54:31.640 --> 54:34.640
ago Ensemble was shut down by Microsoft.

54:34.640 --> 54:38.400
They actually closed down Ensemble Studios, which was very sad for those people working

54:38.400 --> 54:39.400
there.

54:39.400 --> 54:43.240
Well now it's come to light, and for fans of Halo, they might be sad to learn that one

54:43.240 --> 54:45.840
of the things that Ensemble was working on, in fact probably the biggest thing they were

54:45.840 --> 54:48.800
working on, was a Halo MMO.

54:48.800 --> 54:54.180
They were working on a MMO centered in the Halo universe, and apparently even some pictures

54:54.180 --> 54:57.440
have surfaced from what the Halo MMO was supposed to look like.

54:57.440 --> 55:00.520
And it kind of looked like, wow, in the Halo universe.

55:00.520 --> 55:04.720
It's kind of interesting, it looked to be kind of simple like World of Warcraft is.

55:04.720 --> 55:09.060
Very similar layout for those that play Warcraft, or even Warhammer Online, actually the interface

55:09.060 --> 55:10.960
almost looks more like Warhammer Online to me.

55:10.960 --> 55:16.080
Kind of the way it is, you can see characters wheeling dual swords, as well as guns and

55:16.080 --> 55:17.080
all that stuff.

55:17.080 --> 55:23.760
So kind of sad that this project won't see the light of day, but I guess then again if

55:23.760 --> 55:26.960
the game wasn't very good, then maybe it's a good thing it doesn't see the light of day,

55:26.960 --> 55:30.960
because Halo is a franchise you don't want to put out a bad game under.

55:30.960 --> 55:34.760
Although say what you will about Halo 3, although I don't think Halo 3 is necessarily bad,

55:34.760 --> 55:38.160
it's just people wanted a little more out of it I suppose.

55:38.160 --> 55:42.760
So apparently though, keep in mind there are still plenty of other Halo projects in development,

55:42.760 --> 55:45.600
so sadly this MMO will not be one of them.

55:45.600 --> 55:50.680
But you never know, sometimes these things get completely redone somewhere else, you

55:50.680 --> 55:51.720
know what I mean?

55:51.720 --> 55:55.920
Like for instance Star Trek Online, look at that, a particular studio is making that,

55:55.920 --> 56:00.160
they kind of shut down, another company picked it up and is now going to be releasing it.

56:00.160 --> 56:03.360
So who knows?

56:03.360 --> 56:04.840
We'll see.

56:04.840 --> 56:08.680
Holy Shonen in chat puts it very simply, he says, I'm going to miss Ensemble.

56:08.680 --> 56:14.240
Oh sorry, sorry to pour salt in the wound there about the, it's very interesting too,

56:14.240 --> 56:18.840
you don't often hear about what these studios are necessarily working on, the secret projects,

56:18.840 --> 56:20.480
when these studios are closed.

56:20.480 --> 56:24.280
So it's kind of neat that we got to hear a little something about it.

56:24.280 --> 56:28.880
Going forward into our release date so that we can hear about things that are coming out,

56:28.880 --> 56:31.360
and some things that were cancelled.

56:31.360 --> 56:38.520
And for the UK we have on the 30th Cell Zenith coming out on PC, and then we have a few things

56:38.520 --> 56:43.840
for the 1st through the 3rd on the 1st, Mega Man 9 on Xbox 360, so you can go download

56:43.840 --> 56:46.440
that and it's super fun.

56:46.440 --> 56:51.880
On the 3rd there's Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway on PC, Dancing Stage Supernova 2,

56:51.880 --> 57:00.560
Civilization 2, FIFA 09 on damn near everything, Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations

57:00.560 --> 57:04.560
on DS after that, so.

57:04.560 --> 57:11.760
Cool, let's see, this week there is quite a bit coming out, not a lot of it's good,

57:11.760 --> 57:16.880
a lot of PC games, holy shit there's a lot of PC games.

57:16.880 --> 57:21.680
Anyways, for console stuff, we've got a re-release of some Mortal Kombat games in the Mortal

57:21.680 --> 57:26.640
Kombat collection, they'll be available on PS2.

57:26.640 --> 57:32.560
Also coming to the DS, Animal Paradise, yet another animal raising sim, hooray.

57:32.560 --> 57:38.880
Sonic Chronicles, The Dark Brotherhood, the Sonic DS made by Bioware, coming to the DS.

57:38.880 --> 57:47.000
And also Silent Hill Homecoming, coming to the PC, 360 and PS3 this week, pretty awesome.

57:47.000 --> 57:55.000
Hype Mania, coming out on Wii, 360 and PC, I guess on the 360 maybe that's an Xbox Live

57:55.000 --> 58:04.280
Arcade game, I haven't heard that one, let's see here, there's a lot of games that I don't

58:04.280 --> 58:09.720
think are coming out, I'm not going off this list.

58:09.720 --> 58:14.120
Let's see, what else is coming out this week, I don't think there's a lot of other big titles,

58:14.120 --> 58:17.880
some miscellaneous DS games, Unsolved Crimes on the DS, which I actually played that a

58:17.880 --> 58:25.800
little bit as kind of an adventure game from Atari there, you solve crimes, not really

58:25.800 --> 58:29.820
like Ace Attorney or anything like that, but it's pretty cool.

58:29.820 --> 58:34.440
And DT Carnage on PSP, it's a car combat game.

58:34.440 --> 58:46.080
PC, let's see we've got a bunch of games coming out, some of the highlights though, let's

58:46.080 --> 58:55.400
see here, let me read this chat comment really quick because it's funny, I load for real.

58:55.400 --> 59:00.940
Act Def says Silent Hill got a 6.5 by IGN I think, it makes a little annoyed face.

59:00.940 --> 59:05.960
Frisbee says IGN gets a 6.5 sometimes, nice.

59:05.960 --> 59:10.120
Supposedly I guess on PC, and I thought this already came out already, but it says Limbo

59:10.120 --> 59:16.620
of the Lost is coming, and if you remember that god awful song they made, you guys listened

59:16.620 --> 59:20.840
to a little bit ago, yeah that was from that game.

59:20.840 --> 59:35.600
And lastly, let's see here, Sue Tycoon 2 Ultimate for PC, We Cheer on the Wii, and let's see

59:35.600 --> 59:42.040
here, lastly Harvest Moon, Tree of Tranquility on the Wii.

59:42.040 --> 59:45.160
Goodie, more Harvest Moon, yay.

59:45.160 --> 59:50.280
Alright, is that it, alright, let's move over to Japan where it's kind of a slower week,

59:50.280 --> 59:54.600
there's not a whole lot of new stuff coming out, but there is Raiden 4 coming out on the

59:54.600 --> 59:58.420
Xbox 360, so if you like your Raiden games, there's a brand new one, I didn't even know

59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.940
there was one in development, there you go, coming out on the 360.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.720
Moving over to the Playstation 3, not a lot of new stuff, but you do get some price reductions

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.520
on Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion and Warhawk are moving into the best series, as well as, hey

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.120
if you need it, a new Dust Guard filter coming out in black and white, Dust Guard Filter

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.120
3.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.320
Dust Guard Filter 3?

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.900
Yes, comes out this week.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.480
It's not Dust Cap 3?

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.240
No, now it's Dust Guard Filter because it's a Playstation 3.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.680
Ah, Dust Guard Filter.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.840
There you have it.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:32.200
On the Nintendo Wii, Jikyu Powerful Major League 3 is the only new game coming out this

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.720
week, it's a new game from Konami, comes out this week on the Nintendo Wii, so let's see

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.440
if there's anything on the Playstation 2.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:44.160
There are some things on the Playstation 2, including Kanuchi Shiroki Tsubasa no Shuu

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.120
coming regular and limited edition, that same Powerful Major League game also is coming

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:54.640
out on the Playstation 2 as well, and the Magician's Academy comes out on Playstation

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.360
2 in Japan this week.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:03.320
Moving on over to the handhelds, looking at the Nintendo DS, Unknown Soldier Mokuba no

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:11.000
Hoku comes out this week in Japan, as well as Nakamura Sumikko Tettai Shidou Shintoic

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.200
Test One High One Fun DS Lesson from the Rocket Company.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.960
I'm trying to figure out what exactly is the lesson that will be learned in this game.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.040
Let's see, it looks like it might be writing of some sort.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.040
Oh, it's English!

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.880
It's English, learning English.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.880
Huh.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.080
So, probably not a game any of our listeners need if you're listening to this program.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.460
And let's check out the PSP real quick.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.700
Not a whole lot.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.000
Looks like there's about three new games here.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:50.120
To Love, Roo Trouble, Doki Doki, Rinkai Gakuhen comes out on the PSP, as well as Ikitosan,

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.640
Eloquent Fist comes out, regular and limited edition.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:59.000
To make a correction to the comment in the chat room that we had, Silent Hill Homecoming

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.040
hasn't been rated or reviewed by IGN yet.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:11.960
They do have one press rating, which is from, that is a 6.5, that's from the official Xbox

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960
magazine.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.560
So, all your hate needs to be directed to the official Xbox magazine at this time.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.000
IGN, you can hate on it a little bit later.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.360
Alright, that's it for Japanese release dates.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.200
Well, how about more news?

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.160
Cause no good news is good good news?

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.160
Okay.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.160
How about it?

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:40.520
Well, um, Hideo Kojima is the hero of many, many a gamer for giving us the Metal Gear

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520
franchise.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:48.760
And he's saying that he's got ideas for Metal Gear Solid 5, 3 concepts, but he doesn't want

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:53.200
anyone to use them because that means he has to get involved and he doesn't wanna.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.200
He said he was gonna be stepping back out of Metal Gear Solid the whole series, but

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.440
honestly I think that he should have some involvement with it.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.080
It was his story from the beginning.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.200
I don't think that starting a story and leaving it in the hands of other people, especially

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:18.040
if you've controlled it so far, you know, it could, well I mean, it could probably have

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:24.400
less of a bizarre ending than Metal Gear Solid 4 had, maybe, but I don't know, I liked his

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.400
weird storytelling.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.520
Well, I can tell you what one of his ideas were for the new Metal Gear Solid game and

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.440
I'll give you a little bit of a vague idea here.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:42.080
Basically, a couple of snakes, cronies, you know, will be coming to visit him.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:48.760
Unfortunately, when they arrive there, they will figure out that he's dead and to which

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.440
they have to convince everyone around him that he's still alive by moving his arms and

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.160
stuff and hanging out on the beach and that kind of fun stuff.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.160
He's not getting the weekend at Bernie's treatment.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.480
I thought it was dead or alive.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.800
The most dorkest thing I've ever heard.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.320
Okay, here's the thing though, I mean, it's interesting because he might have actually

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.360
really meant it this time when he said he wasn't doing another Metal Gear game, because

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.040
doesn't he always say that, like, I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do it, no, I'm

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.920
not gonna do it, and then he always looks like he does it.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:24.840
Now he's kind of like, this kind of is like, well, I don't really want to do it, but if,

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.640
you know, they wanted me to do it, I have an idea.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:34.720
Well, there was some other type of experimental game that he was working on, but, I mean,

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.680
as long as he writes this- What, bulk tie?

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.800
Sorry.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.960
I think we need a solid snake party game.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:47.580
Well, he's quoted as saying that he wants to create something new and it's difficult

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:53.280
to explain since no one's seen it before, so he doesn't know if it will sell well.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.960
But, I mean, there's nothing to say that he can't have some involvement on Metal Gear

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.520
Solid 5, at least as a creative director, you know, instead of being as hands-on as

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:07.640
he was with a lot of the other stuff, right?

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.800
Hephaestus in chat says it's like, ooh, please beg me to do it and I'll reluctantly agree.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.960
It's kind of what this amounts to.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.960
Nice.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.920
Well, we'll see if he ends up coming back in a larger capacity or if he really means

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.400
it this time.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.760
I honestly think he really means it, but he's not going to be able to resist contributing

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.280
in some way, but he's just going to probably scale back his involvement.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.280
We'll see.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.880
Oh, yeah, the weekend at Bernie's saying that's comedy gold, man.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.120
It'll be awesome.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:42.480
Anyways, there's something out there that you can play for free on your PS3.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.600
That's right.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:50.420
There is actually an MMO available in Japan called Angel Love Online, and it is a free-to-play

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:57.320
MMO, and there are instructions online to allow you to set up your own account and basically

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:01.520
create your own, I guess, login.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:07.120
If you don't have a PlayStation Network login for Japanese PlayStation Network, then you

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:13.120
can create one and also help you create a login for this game.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.600
To create your Japanese PlayStation Network login, the easiest way to do that is actually

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:24.040
go to a website called Japanesepsn.com, and they'll walk you through it.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:31.920
As far as creating your own login for this game, you can actually go to ps3fanboy.com.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:37.460
They have an article on there for that, and also neogaf.com, their forums.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.640
There's another article.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:43.320
The game itself actually looks a little bit like Ragnarok Online, kind of, except really

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.200
like chibi with a bunch of people.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.600
Are you trying to just get Tiara and Jamie interested in this game?

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.480
Not really, but I'm just saying, hey, it's a free-to-play game.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.540
I don't really know what the point of the game is.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:58.600
There is someone riding a giant beetle, so that's kind of cool.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:04.260
Oh, and there's another giant frog or something, but lots of people dressed up really weird.

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:10.840
Someone's in a giant cat robot thing, so yeah, I'm sure this will appeal to somebody.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.960
I don't know what the point of this game is or purpose, because it's all in Japanese,

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.840
so ha ha, funny.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.960
But yeah, check it out, it's free.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:23.520
So free is awesome, and if it sucks, hey, you know what, at least this game looks a

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.680
little bit better than yours.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.680
Is that going to be your new thing?

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.880
Well, at least it's better than yours.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.520
Yes, it is better than yours.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.200
Angel of Online.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.320
Also better than Yaris are price drops, hooray.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.980
And it was rumored that a big old price drop is coming for the Sony Playstation 3, but it

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:46.560
looks like it's actually mostly kind of contained to Blockbuster.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.780
It looks like they appear to be unloading some extra consoles there.

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:53.280
This happened on Friday, and it was caught from a memo that was going around internally

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.720
within the company, is that they're dropping the price of the 40 gigabyte machines at Blockbuster

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:03.320
down to $360, which is about a $40 difference from what they were at.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.120
They're just kind of trying to unload these systems and get them out, since we know there's

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.760
some new SKUs coming, probably from the Tokyo Game Show.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.920
But just so you know, right now, it looks like it's only contained to Blockbuster, but

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:17.880
could this be the first little thing that starts a snowball?

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.800
Well, they already have the new SKU out right now, the 80 gigs core system is available

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:26.800
right now, but they are sitting on a lot of the 40 systems, and what are you going to

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.800
do with those?

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:32.080
I mean, they were the same price as the 80s, so now you have to drop the price to get them

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.120
out of there.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:37.120
So that kind of sucks, but yeah, and I can imagine the same is going to happen with the

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.360
Metal Gear Solid bundles, if there are any left over, they're going to have to drop the

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:48.160
price of those, because the new 160 is coming out in like November sometime, so yeah.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.560
And that's not surprising, but yeah, this is not the price drop you're looking for,

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.320
they're not dropping the system down $200 or anything like that, it's just clearing

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.320
them out.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.680
Right, because you know, with all these games you usually have to install on the systems,

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.340
you probably want to get a bigger hard drive now that we're learning what it's for, and

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:05.760
that is installing the games on your drive basically.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.960
Which reminds me, I need to get a bigger hard drive for the Xbox, my 20 gig drive is finally

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:14.560
starting to fill up to the point where I can't fit much more on it, and it's because of freaking

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560
Rock Band.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.360
I have been kind of clearing out old games and stuff, and I just, I have a lot of crap

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.360
on there.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.120
You know, keep in mind, 7 of the 20 gigs gets taken up with that emulation stuff.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.920
So I think I might finally have to cave and get, you know, a bigger drive.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.200
Let's say, you know, hell freezes over and I want to reinstall Final Fantasy XI on my

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.000
Xbox someday, I just wouldn't be able to do it without a bigger hard drive.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
We'll see.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Or get a second hard drive.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.800
I don't know.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.360
Can you get a 20 gig hard drive cheap?

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360
You know, they don't even make them anymore.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360
Yeah, they do.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.360
Might be able to get them used, right?

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:46.360
They do.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.360
Really?

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360
You can get them for like $59.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.880
That's still a bit of money.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.680
Wait, I mean, because when the 60 gig hard drives come out by themselves, you know, I'm

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.400
sure they're going to drop the price of the 20s.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.400
True.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.680
They just dropped the price of the 120s by like 20 bucks or so, but it's still expensive.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:09.200
By the way, I was at Fry's this weekend randomly and I saw HD DVD players for 40 bucks on the

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.200
360.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200
Yep.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.200
How sad.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.200
And movies from $2.99 and up.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.200
$2.99 and up for the HD movies.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.480
They were still too expensive and I didn't want them.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.480
Yeah.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:22.000
You know, the $2.99 ones are usually kind of crappy things that aren't even real movies.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.200
Usually those types of things that just show off the power of HD players like, you know,

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.960
National Geographic, you know, Discover the World and stuff, which, you know, you might

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.640
want to watch once to go ooh and aah, but that's about it, right?

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.640
So.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640
Anyway, sorry.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.640
Tangent.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.640
My bad.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.640
Well, what is a show without tangents?

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:45.360
Well, here's some good news for all of our Sonic fans and hopefully it won't be like

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.560
some of the previous ones.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:55.880
Um, Yuji Naka is, uh, working on, uh, uh, something with a probe, which is the new development

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880
studio.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.880
They have a website posted that says that it's a new experience that can be played by

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:06.000
penguins.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
How do penguins play video games?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.320
But it'll be something with Sega and I mean, maybe it'll be Sonic.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320
Maybe it'll be Outrun.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.100
I doubt it's Sonic.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.200
It's gotta be something new.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.400
It's a game where you make snow cones.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.400
Pengo!

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.400
Maybe you build igloos.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.400
That'd be fun.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:28.840
But the, the site Frostbite2008, I'll link it in the chat room, but it's got this little

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.800
flash thingy with a penguin in front of a screen.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:39.000
It's actually a propre.sega.jp.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.720
Just go look.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.360
Hopefully this means that the game will involve penguins because that'll be cute.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.360
I love penguins.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.520
That's what I'm hoping for.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:53.440
It looks basically like a blurred out TV, like a widescreen TV in the background and

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:59.960
then a penguin in front of it with the exclamation point and a question mark and a word bubble

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.120
as looking off to the side and the penguin doesn't look very confused.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:08.920
He just looks flappy, but Rob likes penguins.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920
I love penguins.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920
That's what I'm hoping.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:14.480
It's a whole new, I hope it is like a new version of Pengo or something.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:19.400
It means, it means, it means the next Sega game will be released only on Linux.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.400
I somehow doubt that.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.400
I know.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.760
It'll be written in penguin-ese.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.320
You cannot understand it.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.360
You have to, you have to pay for the game in fish.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:35.120
All right, we'll see in a few more days when they announce it.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:42.520
Something else that's going to be coming possibly soon would be the new Sonic Genesis collections,

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:50.040
which is supposed to be coming out on the 360 and PS3, according to some retail listings

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:55.400
dug up, and it says, each with ship dates of February 2009.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.600
Hmm, what could that be?

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.480
Could that actually be coming out?

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.480
I don't know.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.480
Retail listings.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:07.000
I wouldn't have seen that either, would I?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.360
But yeah, so, I don't know, it's probably a collection of all the Sonic games.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:18.680
It's supposed to be pretty cheap, from what I hear, and I'd imagine it probably just has

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.320
like the Sonic Sega Genesis games.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.920
Don't we already kind of have the Genesis games on Xbox Live Arcade?

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.280
Yeah, Sonic Mega Collection or something like that, you know.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.200
Seems a little silly.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.200
But uh, $29.99.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.200
Again.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.400
It's, we've seen this game a million times.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.760
I'm grabbing like $19.99 or $29.99, so, you know, it'd be like the equivalent of buying

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.200
the Xbox Live Arcade games, probably.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.200
It might actually be the Xbox Live Arcade games.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.440
Do we get, I was going to say, do we get the slightly souped up versions?

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.720
I don't know.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.000
Frisbee echoes my thoughts exactly, a Sega compilation.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.880
That's called the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox ones.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.880
It's like we've seen all this before.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.080
Yeah, but the GameCube and Xbox.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.080
So now we get achievements, wooo!

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.080
Exactly.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.080
Wooo!

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.080
Alright.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.940
Well, you know, Sonic is a classic though, despite the fact that they release it over

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:04.940
and over and over again.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.200
It still is a classic game.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:11.040
And we love to pay classic games some tribute here on this program, and that's why every

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.560
week DarkSakura likes to bring us her classic video game of the week.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.900
So DarkSakura, please go into the Dusty Archives of Gaming and find a game that should be highlighted

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:26.080
this week on the program in the Classic Game of the Week segment.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.600
Today's classic game is Mega Man 2.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.440
And I'm saying Mega Man 2 instead of the first one because, honestly, I think Mega Man 2

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.280
is a much better game.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:45.040
So if you want to roll that beautiful bean footage, Rob.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.200
How many of us remember that noise?

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.400
This is Metal Man's music.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:55.120
But basically, it's, you know, it's, okay, who in our chair room does not know Mega Man?

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.040
Do I have to really explain it?

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.840
You're a little blue robot, and you go through all these different stages, fighting off these

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.920
cute little robotic enemies, and you pick up power-ups on the way, like a big giant

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.880
Mega Man head.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:19.080
Also, if you don't know who Mega Man is, he's like Bender from Futurama, totally.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:23.600
At any rate, as you make it through the level, you have to fight a robot master.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:27.480
Ooh, they have whips and chains and never mind.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:31.400
At any rate, basically you have to fight these different robots that each have a different

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:37.040
ability, and the theme of their stage is, you know, goes along with whatever their ability

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.040
is.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:45.160
Like Mega Man shoots out metal blades, and Bubble Man shoots out bubbles that don't do

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.320
much except for the very end of the game, where there's only three places that you use

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.720
the weapon at all.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:56.920
Although there are some robots that if you do it in a certain order, some are weaker

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.280
to others.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.600
This music here is Quick Man stage, which is like the single most annoying stage.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.960
Unless you have fantastic timing, it's almost impossible to get past those beams that shoot

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960
across.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960
Use Flash Man power.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.280
That's right, use Flash Man power.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.440
However Dan can do it without using Flash Man's thing.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.440
That's insane.

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.640
I've seen him do it, I did not believe he could do it until I saw him do it.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.600
Plus you need that Flash Man power to beat the boss.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:25.040
It really helps beating the boss, because you can take like a third of his life away

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.000
instantly if you have all the Flash Man power.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.760
Yeah, it's like I was saying earlier, each of the enemies in the game have a particular

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:41.360
weakness to the other boss's master's powers, except for Air Man, which you can only really

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:46.480
get him with the regular shot and the metal blades work on him too.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.800
I think you're supposed to use Leaf Shield if you have it.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.800
I think.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:50.800
I might be wrong.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.480
I always just started off with Air Man.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.160
I either started off with Metal Man or Air Man.

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.800
Yeah, I started with Metal Man.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.560
That person just did it, see.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.080
You have to have impeccable timing to be able to get past this part though.

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.080
You just have to have it memorized.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:08.400
We'll have to link that one in the chat room, because I was very- and they even got the

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.400
power up too.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.400
This is the part that always got me.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.400
Yeah.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.800
Oh no, it was- yeah it was this one, sorry.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:23.440
Anyway, I know this is really great radio, but I uh, this is actually one of my all time

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440
favorite games.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.960
It's up there on the list.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:31.920
I even got so bored one day that I cracked the code by myself just experimenting with

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.920
it.

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.600
The password code where you put in the red blocks and blue box wherever to get past whatever

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.220
and get all of the power ups and everything.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:43.880
And I wrote it on a pair of torn up blue jeans.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.680
So I actually had it rolled up like a scroll.

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.160
Scroll and every- scroll.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:53.080
Like a scroll and everything, it was my special thing to get past that.

01:17:53.080 --> 01:18:00.240
The other cool thing about this one is that they actually had to fight to get this one

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.480
out since the first Mega Man didn't have- well Rockman I should say in Japan, didn't

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.520
really have that big of a following.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:13.960
But since they put more work into the game and improved the graphics and the overall

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.840
play of it, they were able to get this out and since then it's become basically a staple

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:22.520
of almost anyone's classic collection.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:27.000
Of course it's spawned so many sequels that we've lost count, including a couple of fighting

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:36.920
games, the Power Battles and a few other- there's even the whole Mega Man EXE series,

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.360
you know, we wouldn't have that without this even though I think we'd be better off without

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.080
it because I don't really care for it personally.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:49.520
It also made GameSpot's greatest games of all time.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:56.300
It was number 33 in Nintendo Power's top 200 Nintendo games ever list.

01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.080
It also had a novelization.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:04.720
They released a novel of it that- I guess it was only in the US but it was put out by

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.960
Scholastic like every other dance kid's book in the late 80s and early 90s.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.400
Was that the same guy who did the Blaster Master books and all that stuff?

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.400
It doesn't say.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.400
Huh.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.520
It doesn't say.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:21.920
It also had like one of the best worst cover arts ever, you know, because it had him holding

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.240
the gun and everything and had the visor, it was so stupid and ugly.

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:33.320
Also there was a Navi mode in the game if you got the Rockman Complete Works discs that

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:39.520
came out on Playstation in 1999 in Japan, which were the NES versions with the tons

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:49.320
of bonuses, but it also had a sort of, I guess a commentary kind of mode for playing through

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320
the game.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.240
It was also included in the Mega Man Anniversary Collection.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.880
It was on PS2 and GameCube and Xbox.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.000
So again, it's one of my favorite games.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.800
And also this is the game that gave us Rush, remember?

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:09.920
You could get the platform or the jet or the other Rush thing that I forget.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920
What was it?

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.920
The one that wrote up walls?

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:12.920
Number three.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:13.920
Yeah.

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.920
Yeah.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.880
You could, and it also had the E-Tank, so you could get your full refill system and

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.880
everything.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:27.800
And this is the one that I think set the stage for the releases afterwards.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.280
And it's really the one that the Mega Man 9 is even modeled after because you don't

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.080
have the power slide or a lot of that stuff that came even in 3, you don't see that

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.080
in 9.

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:40.240
I mean, 9 is in some ways a direct sequel to 2, not to 8.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.480
As far as the way it plays, it does.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:49.320
But to be technical, there was actually, for 8 and 9, there was a game that came in between.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:55.240
And I do want to say that it was Mega Man and Bass.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:02.000
Yeah, when Mega Man and Bass came out, it was actually under development, it was titled

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.800
Rock 8.5.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:10.400
So 9 is supposed to be a direct sequel, I mean an actual full sequel to 8 following

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.320
through that whole thing.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:19.040
But honestly, this is the one I will sit back and go, and for a little while, I can't do

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.440
it now because of course it's been a while since I've played this game regularly, I

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.640
used to be able to do the dragon part blindfolded.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:31.160
Because it is the same pattern, if you know the pattern, I mean, I would die sometimes,

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.000
but if you know the pattern, then it wasn't really all that hard because it did the same

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
damn thing every time.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.760
Of course if you don't have all your- That's more impressive than being able to do the

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.280
quick man beams in my opinion.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:46.680
And also if you don't know how to do, well if you don't save all your crash blocks to

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:52.760
that one right towards the end, then you're screwed for the whole rest of the game.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.760
Do you know what I mean?

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.400
The one with the wall things that shoot at you.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:00.000
And the thing is, I can be completely ambiguous about all the details of this game, and people

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.280
will still know what the hell I'm talking about.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.280
Unless they're like, I guess they're 12 or something.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:13.880
So that's the game, Mega Man 2, if you haven't played it, damn it, why haven't you?

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.240
And it's on Virtual Console now, right?

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.600
Yes, I know, so they need to get it now.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.320
Although I would recommend instead of getting it on Virtual Console, just get, even though

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.280
I know people at the GameCube version of the Mega Man collection, just get the Mega Man

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280
collection.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.480
No, you have to have the Nintendo.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.920
Alright, there you go, Mega Man 2, your classic game of the week.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.920
Enjoy.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.880
Alright, that's gonna bring part A to a close here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.600
We're gonna take ourselves a break though, we got plenty more when we come back.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:43.040
We haven't even begun to talk about some of the rumors going around about the DS.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:46.160
And speaking of the Wii, we got plenty more Wii news coming up when we get back, and of

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:48.640
course the mailbag and your emails.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:54.280
And plenty more when we come back here on Orange Lounge Radio, so stay tuned.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.200
Whoa, what is going on over there?

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.200
I dropped the microphone.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.400
Jamie's about ready to just run out of here now that it's break time, no I'm kidding.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:10.320
Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.240
So you know this is the part of the show where we'd usually play a commercial or something

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:16.400
like that, but we wanted to give something extra special to those of you guys listening

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.400
tonight.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:21.480
And plus the fact we haven't gotten a lot of new submissions lately for new PSAs or

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.480
what have you.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.540
So we're gonna do a giveaway tonight, and this is something extra special for you guys.

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:32.040
We have an Xbox 360 code for Feeding Frenzy 2.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.760
It's a brand new game that came out from PopCap a couple weeks ago on Xbox Live Marketplace.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:39.960
You might know the game Feeding Frenzy is already there on Xbox Live Marketplace.

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:43.840
And PopCap games are always a good time for some good casual fun, so we'd like you to

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.840
get in on the fun.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:45.920
We're gonna give away a code.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:54.920
All you have to do, email us, fishing at orangeloungeradio.com, that's F-I-S-H-I-N-G at orangeloungeradio.com

We'll give that away next week live.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:19.720
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us at Orange Lounge

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.720
Radio.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:28.120
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this Sunday evening, September the 28th

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.240
of 2008, if you can believe it.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:35.520
October's almost here and then pretty soon it'll be 2009.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.520
Where does the time go?

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.520
I don't know anymore.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.520
Alright.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:43.520
Well, we've talked quite a bit about Fable 2 in the last break and that they're inserting

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.800
something in a little later after the game is released.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:46.800
We talked a little bit about 360.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.720
Now we're going to talk a little bit about the Nintendo DS and Loki's going to start

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:51.720
us off tonight.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:56.120
Yes, there's some very interesting rumors coming out about the DS.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:03.280
Actually, this is actually coming from a Japanese newspaper and it's also from their website

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:06.040
as well.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:11.640
And there may be some revisions coming to the DS very, very soon.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:19.160
Those revisions would be, of course, an added camera that will be, I guess, integrated into

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:25.040
the handheld itself and also the ability to play music.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:29.680
And apparently one of the routes that they're going with this is, I guess, it's going to

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:32.440
support using SD memory cards.

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:38.920
So you'll be able to transfer stuff back and forth from your Wii system to your DS.

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:45.440
You'll be able to load songs, I guess, onto it as well through that.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.240
And the newspaper looks like Nikkei.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:56.120
They're expecting that the system be priced under 20,000 yen.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:04.080
And the Nintendo DS Lite currently is priced at 16,800 yen in Japan.

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:09.180
And it looks like the new DS will launch first in Japan with other countries seeing an allocation

01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:17.600
of several hundred thousand units before anybody else overseas sees them, so interesting.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:24.440
And funny because this kind of goes in with the other story that's come out a couple days

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:33.160
ago about how Nintendo will be doing a media event on October 2nd and 3rd.

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:40.040
Hmm, a little interesting that this comes out in a newspaper.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.200
I don't think that they would run rumors.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:50.400
And what other announcements could we possibly expect from this media event?

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:57.800
Because this is, I think, their opportunity to save face from E3.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:03.440
My guess, which is interesting, my guess would be of course announcing Disaster Day of Crisis

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:06.560
since it's already out in Japan, Europe is right around the corner.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:09.520
They haven't announced the date for the US yet.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:15.920
And the other thing I wouldn't be surprised if I saw was that they're publishing Conduit.

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:20.360
Because if you notice, for a game that doesn't have a publisher, there's sure a lot of screenshots

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:26.040
coming out every single day, and kind of the whole marketing campaign is in full force,

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:30.280
kind of makes you go, hmm, why would they be trying to market this game so strongly

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.840
right now when they don't even have a publisher yet?

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:37.120
Because usually the publisher is the one that does the marketing for them.

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.280
Interesting to think about that maybe this game is right around the corner, and maybe

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.640
Nintendo's publishing it.

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:49.280
After all, it was in Nintendo's booth at PAX, so, hmm, might be a guess.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.360
Well hey, before the show, we, you know, and that DS is supposed to be out this year.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:58.080
So that could be, you know, that's probably some of the strongest evidence as to why they

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.960
would need a special press conference to announce it.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.960
Yeah.

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:01.960
It's coming out this year.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.960
Very interesting.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.960
What do you think?

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.200
Would you buy a DS for the camera and the music and all this stuff?

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.200
Maybe.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.200
Maybe?

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.200
Maybe.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.200
I have to see if it's worth it.

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.200
I expected you to say give me a flat up no.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.200
I'm kind of surprised.

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:17.200
You know, but see the thing is, what other applications on the homebrew side could use

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.400
this camera and stuff?

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.520
That would be, I'd be more interested to see that.

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.840
And you just want to hack it.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:22.840
Yes.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:23.840
Alright.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:24.840
Darcy, what do you think?

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:25.840
I wouldn't waste my money on it.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.480
I already have 50 million other things that do all that.

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.480
I've got an iPhone.

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.640
I don't need anything else that takes pictures or plays music, so.

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:36.200
Tiara, any thoughts for you on this?

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:40.360
Well, like I said on Twitter, if it's not broke, don't fix it.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.560
I already have a DS that works, so there's no reason for me to buy another one.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.120
Speaking of Twitter, let's go over there and look at the answers to tonight's pre-show

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.600
and we do have a Twitter account at OLR, simply our Twitter name, and sometimes we ask some

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.100
questions before the show and read some of our favorite answers on the air.

01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:59.200
We asked, would you buy the Nintendo DS again if they re-release it with the camera and

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.320
music playback abilities?

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:04.300
We had a lot of replies tonight, so I'm going to try to read from people we don't usually

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.680
hear from in the chat room or on Skype.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:13.200
JohnnyG44 says, no, because almost everyone has a phone that can do both of those things.

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.560
I would buy a new DS with onboard memory storage though.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:20.720
Crows says, I have a cell phone with two megapixels and an iPod with 30 gigabytes.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.160
I don't need those features.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.760
It would just make it cost like 300 bucks.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:31.200
Frisbee says, no, most people have an MP3 player, a digital camera, a camera MP3 phone

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.520
and a DS already.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.600
Why pay for all three of these all over again?

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.680
Dark Circuitry says, I don't have a DS in the first place, but I'd happily buy one if

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.760
it had those extra features, albeit at a lower price than it is now.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.000
Decipher13 says, I'm still packing a fat, a fat, a DS fat.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.200
I've held off on getting a light so far, but I do collect Nintendo handhelds.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.200
I may eventually.

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.200
I like that.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.200
I collect Nintendo handhelds.

01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:00.640
Can you imagine though, if they did have storage, like say gig of storage space on there, how

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.080
bad that would make the Wii look?

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:07.600
It's like you can afford to put a gig of storage on here and yet you can't have any storage

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.600
on the Wii.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:09.600
You know, five.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.600
Very interesting.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.600
But it has been a couple of years.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.600
The cost of memory has maybe come down.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.600
Let me read a couple more here.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.640
Harry AKA says, no, I don't think I would.

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.300
And then just to show the diverse amount of responses we're getting, that's immediately

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:23.000
followed by Durhindermyth says, hell yes.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.620
I'd rather have a GBA multiplayer compatibility back, but the camera would be flipping awesome.

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:29.480
So kind of a wide variety of answers on Twitter.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:33.160
I didn't even read them all, but it's very varied in the yeses and nos there.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.720
Thanks to everybody that replied on Twitter.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.120
Sorry to those that didn't get through, but I try to focus on those that usually don't

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.120
join us in chat.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.960
Very interesting, the diverse amount of responses.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.240
I think there were enough yeses, though, that this is going to be successful if they release

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.240
it.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.720
Well, they're not really having trouble selling yeses right now, I think, but I mean, and

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:53.460
they're not really, I don't think the PSP is getting there, you know, close to them

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:54.460
anytime soon.

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:59.960
I think this is obviously the compete against Apple, I mean, because now that they're becoming,

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:07.840
you know, the gaming portable system, I mean, that's hard to swallow, but, you know, maybe

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:11.160
this is the compete with them, because it's cheaper.

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.160
Possibly.

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:17.040
It seems kind of a long ways afterwards to, you know, to compete with PSP.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:21.240
And now that we have camera functionality, I mean, how long will it be before we get,

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.080
like, gimmicky shit to go along with that?

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.080
I mean, I don't know.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:31.280
Well, all right, well, you know, if they hadn't moved enough copies of the DS Lite, maybe

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:35.600
doing some charitable work would convince more people to get a DS, and that is just

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.600
what is happening.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:43.040
So, Amazon has actually released a new version of the Nintendo DS, apparently, on their site.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:46.720
It's what's called the Polar White Console, but one special difference between this and

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:52.000
a normal DS is that it actually has the pink breast cancer awareness ribbon, kind of like

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.900
a universal logo, if you will, right there on the DS itself.

01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:02.720
It's going to be $129.99, which is what any other DS would cost, but Nintendo is donating

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:08.000
$25 from every purchase of one of these Nintendo DSes to a cancer research charity, a very

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.600
commonly heard one in breast cancer awareness circles, Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.760
The minimum donation promised is $100,000.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:17.980
So there you go.

01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:21.920
If you want to do a little bit of charity, feel good about your purchase, you know the

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:25.240
$5 goes to this Breast Cancer Awareness Foundation.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.720
Well, you might want to hold off because, you know, there's a new DS possibly around

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:29.920
the corner.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.880
And hey, you know what, if you want to make that contribution, you can go ahead and do

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:33.880
that on your own.

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:36.240
You don't need another large company to do that for you.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:40.840
I have to be honest, I actually kind of agree with Loki here, as much as I appreciate what

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:46.120
Nintendo is trying to do here, I don't see myself going out and buying another DS just

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:49.600
for this when I could donate $20 myself.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.600
You know what I mean?

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:51.600
Yeah.

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.600
I don't know.

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:56.180
And here's, I'm going to ask a question I think is out there, but some people might

01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.700
be too afraid to ask, okay?

01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:59.720
I'm going to put it out there.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:04.960
Is this Nintendo, is this another way that Nintendo is trying to get women?

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:11.880
I mean, you know, I hate to say it's a marketing ploy, but in a way, look at what they've been

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.000
advertising lately, Carrie Underwood, pink DS's.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.280
Is this a way for them to try and attract women to the Nintendo DS?

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:27.760
I would totally date Nintendo DS if he got a better job and could prove that he's into

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:31.560
being committed to our relationship.

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.720
But what does him adoring a pink ribbon do for you?

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:38.860
Does it make him that much sexier?

01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:39.960
Not really.

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:45.460
If I wanted to donate $5 towards breast cancer, I could just donate $5 instead of going out

01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:50.800
and buying a whole new, you know, DS or, you know, I could donate however much I want and

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:54.740
get that as a tax write-off where it doesn't work that way if you buy the pink DS and let

01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:56.760
Nintendo give them $5.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:03.200
Well, on top of that, with all of these, you know, for example, the runs, the marketing

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.920
going in behind this, that's money they're spending on marketing and organizing events

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:15.360
that actually just could go to the research, especially for, you know, as poorly coordinated

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:20.480
as a lot of the research is right now, they should put, you know, the money into instead

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:26.520
of, we're all aware, the awareness is there, you know, I think that the money is better.

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.520
And you can go on-

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.300
Applied towards the event, you know, towards not the awareness of, but the treatment thereof.

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:35.600
And if you don't know how to donate, I mean, you can go to their website online.

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:40.280
It's so simple and pretty much, I mean, there's links that tell you how to donate right there.

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.280
I mean-

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.280
Komen.org.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.280
K-O-M-E-N.O-R-G.

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:44.600
Exactly.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:50.820
And I'm sorry, but this is, it does seem kind of like a cheap attempt to get women to play

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:51.920
their damn console.

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.560
I mean, I hate to say it-

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:54.560
Oh, I'm helping breast cancer!

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.560
No, you're not.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.560
No, you're not.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.600
Think of it, if you really want to make an impact to breast cancer and you don't really

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.600
care about this console, donate $129.99 to breast cancer, then there you go.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:11.040
Well, I think there's a happy medium somewhere, but it's just, you know, or charge a little

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.240
more money for it.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.160
You know, they do that with postage stamps, right?

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:17.280
They charge a little more money for it, but it's that extra money that goes towards the

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.280
research.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.280
It's kind of like a donation.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280
I don't know.

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.760
It's just so that they can come out later on and go, look, we donated $100,000 to breast

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.760
cancer.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.640
It's, you know, we're so helpful.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:28.980
It's all for PR.

01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.440
It's all to make them look good.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:35.420
Giove Dea in our chat room says, sorry, but as a girl, I'd probably break a pink DS with

01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:38.240
a hammer because it would be fun.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.920
So sometimes, you know, you don't always get all the women with the pink and all that,

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:48.960
but my question would be, but what do you think of the white DS with the pink ribbon?

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:52.620
What about, you know, because they always talk about breast cancer and stuff, and they

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:56.500
have really good campaigns for breast cancer and cervical cancer and that kind of stuff,

01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:03.120
but heart disease, just lung cancer, you know, diabetes, stuff like that, you know, that

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.000
kills a lot more people than breast cancer.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.640
So how about donating to that instead, too?

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.640
All right.

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.240
There's no ribbon for that, unfortunately.

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:15.500
So yeah, certainly some controversial opinions in the community.

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.580
We look forward to hearing yours.

01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:17.880
Mailbag at orangeonitrader.com.

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.760
Jamie will read them all live on air.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.760
All right.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:26.160
Just, just like, she'll read the next story.

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:31.920
The next story is, Orange Don't Radio host Rob Roberts ended up being found in the garbage

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.360
chopped to tiny bits with a I Told You So from co-host.

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.360
That's sad.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.360
Huh?

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.360
Yeah, only to you.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:48.720
Anyway, um, for our, uh, our wee friends who are wee little friends who are, uh, not only

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:55.800
virtual console users, but love NEC and Hudson and all the things associated with the PC

01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.880
engine slash turbo graphics, we are getting super graphics games and I, I have to apologize

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:06.440
to Bobby for what I, uh, a little bit of incorrectness on my comment.

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:13.060
The super graphics actually was the successor to the PC engine, um, especially the PC engine

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:23.760
duo with the arcade card, uh, units as, um, 100%, uh, backwards compatible and had new

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.840
super hue card games that you could play.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:33.060
Um, and also, uh, these other peripherals that never ended up coming out for it, including

01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:38.440
a fully functional, uh, well, a full representation of a flight joystick like they've got for,

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.840
you know, the flight simulators on PC now.

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.920
But at any rate, um, super graphics games are going to be coming to virtual console.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:52.880
The first of them being Dai Makaimura, which, uh, was, uh, Ghouls and Ghosts.

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:58.880
And honestly, the, I've seen the super graphics version of it and it's one of the best ever

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.820
as far as any type of, um, home system port.

01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:04.200
So I am personally very excited about that.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:10.440
Nintendo hasn't announced a US treatment, um, sorry, US release, but there are, um,

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:15.440
many C console imports at the shop channel, so hey, maybe we'll be getting it.

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.440
That'll be pretty cool.

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:21.120
But on top of that, other games, you know, that we, we could be looking forward to that

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:28.800
came out on, uh, super graphics in Japan was 1941 Counter-Attack, um, well, really, I think

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.960
that's about all the ones that we are going to know, uh, for sure, except for there was

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:37.400
a rumor that Strider was, um, there was a prototype for it, so we could be getting a

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:41.480
really good version of Strider if they decided to do a release on that, although the last,

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:47.800
uh, PC Engine release of that was, uh, the arcade card version for, uh, PC Engine Duo.

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.520
But, um, I'm, I'm really excited.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:56.280
The super graphics, it, it was, the games were expensive, dude, they were like 110 bucks

01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:04.720
a piece for HuCards and it could have done better if, you know, if it wasn't so expensive.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:09.480
And how many of these are actually out there?

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.480
Not a lot, right?

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.880
There were seven created.

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:14.880
Two were unreleased.

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.000
One of them, um, No, we're not talking about the games, we're talking about the systems

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
itself.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
There's not a lot of them.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Oh, the systems?

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Yeah, there's not a lot of them out there, right?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.400
Uh, I don't know off the top of my head, but I do know that you can still find them, actually.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:29.400
Wow.

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:35.400
Um, in fact, uh, the, uh, the article that we're getting information from, uh, on Joystiq,

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:40.440
so that they got, there's Super Potato and, um, Akihabara for 250 bucks.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.680
I've seen them before.

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.360
You actually, I think you'd have an easier time getting a super graphics than you would

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.000
a Duo LT.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.240
I'm looking right now on eBay, just curious what people would charge for these, and I

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:57.000
see one, uh, NEC super graphics system with Battle Ace, new, very rare, $89.99, which

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.360
isn't bad, but there's six days left on it, so who knows what that is?

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.360
That's good luck, too.

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.600
That auction, I can see that auction going to about 200, 200, 250, like, you know, what

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:11.600
this one was, but then again, you know, you can also buy a, uh, a Duo RX for about, you

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:18.200
know, 175 to 200, so really, I don't think that it's that super rare, just because of

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:22.080
the limited release of the games, just not very well known in that respect, but I think

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.800
that they, I'll find out how many of them they produced.

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:28.960
All right, well, anyhow, um, regardless, you know, it's gonna bring a whole, you know,

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.920
even though, I guess, not a whole lot of new games, but certainly something that probably

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:38.440
a lot of people never have experienced before, uh, to the market via virtual consoles, so

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.800
that's neat, I suppose.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.060
I bet you'll be checking out some of these games, DarkSakura.

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:45.060
Will you love them?

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:48.880
Well, I definitely would be, I'm definitely interested in getting Daimakai Mora, although,

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:54.040
honestly, I have the Saturn release, which was the arcade version, um, but it'd be cool,

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.280
I mean, to have it on, especially getting that over Super Ghouls N' Ghosts, because honestly,

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:05.360
that game was kind of crap for being in that series, but what was the, Chomakai Mora was

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:13.680
the name for that one, even going by the original name, um, but I'm not, I'm checking it out,

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:17.720
and I don't see exactly how many were made.

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:22.480
Well, they should just release all the games at once, just have a big Super Graphics week,

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.760
although I somehow doubt that'll happen.

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:30.880
But it actually, it seems pretty cool, though, that it, um, used, uh, two independently scrolling,

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:34.720
uh, background layers as far as its graphics output, sort of like how the Genesis did,

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.000
which, you know, was, like, one of the, in fact, they had a problem with some of the

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.200
releases of the games for one system versus the other, because of, uh, if it was a single

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:48.680
or dual layer for the app, it had used, uh, two video chips, it was a pretty advanced

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:52.840
system for its time, it just was pretty darn expensive.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:58.320
Um, Face Distance Chat asks, why, wait, five games were released for the console, how long

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.000
a life could that have on virtual console?

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.200
Well, it's, I don't know if it's necessarily about trying to milk, you know, the life of,

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.400
of the, um, system, but let's face it, Nintendo or, you know, the companies behind it share

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:12.720
in the profits of, you know, however much they're gonna charge for each one of these

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:17.920
games, let's say $7 for each sale, you know, that's $7 they weren't gonna get before, especially

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.840
for a lot of people who have never played these games ever, ever, it's gonna be a bit

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.200
of money in their pocket.

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:28.520
Well, one thing, one thing, though, that also I, I, I think the reason why they're going

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:32.520
ahead and putting the Super Graphics games out is because basically a Super Graphics

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:39.560
really is just a, a souped up PC Engine, and if virtual console can emulate, um, PC Engine

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:43.920
games with no problem, especially to the CD games, there's absolutely no reason why it

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.560
can't, um, emulate the Super Graphics as well.

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:52.160
I mean, the, the audio output was exactly the same as the PC Engine, it was the same

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.160
thing.

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:54.160
Alright.

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:55.160
So.

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:59.280
You should look at that, uh, eBay link that Act F just posted, you might like that.

01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:00.280
Yeah.

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:01.280
Alright.

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.240
Anyhow, uh, let's, let's move on, uh, more news.

01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:06.320
We've spent an awful lot of time talking about a years old system, but that's alright, it's

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.320
part of gaming history.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:10.680
Well, hey, didn't we talk about the, the Master System a few weeks ago?

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:13.800
I know, I know, well, who knows, next week we'll dedicate it to the Pippin.

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:14.800
Eh.

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:21.280
I don't know about that, but, um, there's news coming out of Famitsu Magazine saying

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:27.760
that Level 5 is going to be teaming up with Studio Ghibli on, um, a brand new DS project

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:34.280
entitled, uh, Ni No Kuni The Another World, and of course, um, the studio that brought

01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:41.120
you Totoro and the plethora of other awesome animated films will be doing the animation

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.360
for that title as well.

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:49.200
And, um, to make the game unique, it will come with a Magic Master Book, I guess that

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:53.440
will be shared by the main character of the game, and which needs to be referred to while

01:43:53.440 --> 01:44:01.040
playing the game, and, um, also they will be making a console version at some point.

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.360
So that's kinda cool.

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:07.760
Um, nice to see some pretty, you know, solid animated games coming to the DS.

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:11.360
Have we had a new Studio Ghibli movie in a while?

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.360
We haven't seen one in a while.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:16.040
There's, uh, I thought there was a new one coming, but I thought there was one that was

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:18.640
like coming out this year or something, I just haven't heard much of it.

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:20.840
Maybe it already came out in Japan and it's not out here yet.

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:21.840
I don't know.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.400
Ever since I got out of the movie department and, you know, I haven't really been paying

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:30.680
attention to what new movies are coming out from that studio, so, uh, yeah.

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:31.680
I thought I heard one coming out.

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:32.680
But all of them are gold.

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:33.680
I mean, seriously.

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:34.680
Yeah.

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:35.680
They're good movies.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.240
So I'm very curious to see what kind of game comes out of this, because it could either

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.000
be really good or just one of those things that looks good on paper.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.240
Well, Level 5 is not stopping there with that partnership.

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.620
They are also going to be making some new games for the PSP.

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:51.640
They don't really have anything to do with the Studio Ghibli project.

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.160
However, they are doing some other games on the PSP.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.160
One of them is called Ushiro.

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.100
It's kind of a scary RPG, if you want to say, for the PSP.

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:05.400
You will actually kind of play as a shin-gami.

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:11.240
It's a god of death in Japanese lore, and you will fight monsters and also grant people's

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.320
wishes.

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.080
That's what the part of the game is.

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.200
So there you go.

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:20.720
There's another game called Dambol Senki, or Dambol Senki is also coming out, Cardboard

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:21.880
War Machine.

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.640
It's another RPG where you actually kind of build a robot and you battle against other

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.760
robots that you encounter.

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.600
Not a lot else known about that game, but some RPG projects for the PSP coming from

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:37.440
Level 5, which will certainly be of interest to PSP fans, because, you know, we don't often

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:41.360
hear about really, really big games on the PSP for a while now.

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:44.640
I mean, these games won't be coming out soon, but it's nice, especially with the PSP fans,

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.000
to know that these are coming out.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.280
By the way, I don't think it made the show world tonight, but did anybody read on one

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.120
of the blogs this week something about, like, there was something where Sony was saying

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:54.280
they don't want ports anymore on the PSP?

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:55.280
They don't...

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.280
Yeah, they should talk.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.280
I know, it's just kind of interesting, but...

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:01.280
No more ports on the PSP!

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:04.960
Well, they actually kind of port it in reverse a lot of times.

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:06.560
They port PSP games to PS2.

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.080
Well, I kind of thought that was interesting.

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:11.640
They don't want ports on the PSP, I think, of, you know, probably other...

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:15.080
But I'm thinking, like, well, they still got some big sellers, like, Puzzle Quest would

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:16.900
be a port that's a big sell, right?

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:17.900
Why would you want to say no to that?

01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:21.000
Well, I think they were looking for games that are developed specifically for the PSP.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.640
They don't want, like, because a lot of the games that come out, the PSP version isn't

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:29.760
exactly that strong, and so it's making the console look kind of weak.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.520
But I think they need, I don't know, it's like a double-edged sword there.

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.360
They need more units to be sold, so more publishers get interested in it.

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.800
But they need more publishers that are interested in it, so they can get more units sold.

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:44.320
Before Dr. Salker gets to the next story, I got the answer to the question I was looking

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.320
for.

01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:51.120
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea just came out from Studio Ghibli.

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:54.400
And I thought I heard something about that that was the name of the new movie.

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.440
But it's, correct me if I'm wrong, it's only out in Japan, right?

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:59.840
It hasn't come out here because Disney has to do their thing with the translation and

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.840
all that.

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:04.120
So we probably won't see it till early next year, probably.

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:05.120
So.

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:09.440
Alright, we can move on with gaming news, right, Dr. Salker?

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.440
That we can.

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:15.640
Well, there is some news about, for City of Heroes, I know that there are plenty of people

01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:24.520
who still play that, that the mission editor is actually going to be delayed, so now issue

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:29.600
13 is to be retitled power and responsibility.

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.560
It has everything else that was supposed to come out with the architect mode and an extension

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:43.440
for the sidekick buddy system that's a leveling pact, so basically it lets you and your friends

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.680
synchronize your experience so that you're always at the same level.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:53.720
And even if one person plays more than the other, so you can play together more on an

01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:54.720
even keel.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:55.720
That's kind of cool.

01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:01.800
Also, there's multi-builds, so you can keep two different versions of the same character.

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:06.920
There's also day jobs, power sets, and merit rewards will be included as well.

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:11.200
And they say that the architect mission editor will be coming out later.

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:18.640
But also, part of the thing in it is supposed to let you create your own NPCs for those

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:21.360
missions, so that's pretty cool.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.640
Very cool.

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:30.920
Well, one Marvel superhero has had a couple, I don't know, tie-ins with the comic that

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.960
weren't exactly great.

01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:42.040
Some of the last couple movies actually have been kind of from horrible to not awesome.

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:48.120
But yes, Punisher will be getting not only a new movie this year, but a new game thanks

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.280
to the PlayStation Network.

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:56.880
Punisher No Mercy is exclusive to the PlayStation Network and will be coming to us from Zen

01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:05.120
Studios, who unfortunately don't have much of a resume, but Rocky and Bullwinkle, the

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:10.280
Xbox Live Arcade game and the new Mushroom Man game, which is kind of, eh, alright.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:14.960
But who knows, maybe this is the diamond in the rough.

01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:21.840
It will be powered by the Unreal 3 engine, and of course we'll follow Frank Castle as

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.440
he seeks revenge.

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.640
And they've got some screenshots out for the game so far, it actually looks pretty good.

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:38.640
No word on how it's going to play, but apparently also, I guess, I don't know.

01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:41.040
It's no word on when exactly it's going to be released.

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.520
I would imagine maybe around the time of the film.

01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:50.360
Oh, that's what it says, aiming to release the game in line with the new Punisher film.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.400
And it will include both single and multiplayer modes as well, character customizations and

01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:56.400
trophies.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:03.040
Alright, well, hopefully we'll see more about this game developing in the next few months.

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.040
And hopefully there'll be a demo, because...

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:07.360
Demos are a good way to try games.

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:10.440
Yes, exactly, especially if they're questionable on their quality.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.440
Alright.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.280
Hey, some folks in chat disagree with our assessment of the Rocky and Bullwinkle arcade

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.280
game.

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:18.280
Act Def says, Rocky and Bullwinkle is awesome.

01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.160
I agree, the cartoon is awesome.

01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:24.400
SonicM88 says, why did everyone hate Rocky and Bullwinkle?

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.720
It just, I don't know, the fun factor was kind of missing from that game, especially

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:32.640
for something so nostalgic, the game just kind of felt cheap to me.

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:36.520
I don't know, it's really hard to put my finger on it, but it just kind of felt like it just

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.920
got, like, it wasn't any fun.

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:43.640
The minigames were kind of like, they might make you smile for a second, but then you're

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:45.200
like, eh, I can't see myself playing this.

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.200
It would have been a better game on the Wii.

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.280
You think?

01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.520
With the motion control and everything?

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:50.520
Maybe.

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.520
Maybe.

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:54.860
I mean, it's just, the Wii seems to be the party game machine, but at the same time it's

01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:56.560
getting over killed with that stuff.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:59.160
That genre is way too much on there.

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:05.040
It's like if you want to call, you know, the Xbox 360 a first person shooter console, then

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:08.960
the Wii is definitely the party game console.

01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:13.600
Alright, moving on, and this is going to, you know, our long time fans, you know, because

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:17.440
I think we mention this quite often, we had started originally way back on episode one

01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:22.400
as a show really revolving around music based video games, and especially DDR was a big

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:26.080
focus of this game, of that era, of Orange Launch Radio.

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:29.120
So I'm sure a lot of our listeners who remember that, you know, still follow what goes on

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:33.440
in the DDR world, are going to find this news very interesting, because it isn't about DDR,

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:37.280
but a possible new competitor to DDR, question mark.

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:42.020
Not a lot is known about it, but we do know that a patent has been filed with the official

01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:48.900
US Patent and Trademark Office by Activision for a game called Dance Hero.

01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:53.560
Just like Guitar Hero, so on and so on, now we are going to, and DJ Hero, which we know

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:56.600
is already kind of in the works, Dance Hero.

01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:01.380
It's going to be an interactive video game program and video game controllers.

01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:06.680
But before you just jump in straight in your mind to rip off, you know, you got to think,

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:11.120
well, you know, even if Guitar Hero was certainly inspired by Guitar Freaks, they changed a

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:12.200
heck of a lot about it.

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:16.080
I mean, the look and feel is not really the same, and certainly in the song list and the

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:18.760
way it plays out, it's much different.

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:24.300
I for one, I'm very curious to see how they kind of go to Dance Hero.

01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:30.060
I've said this for a long time back in the old, you know, DDR centric episodes of Orange

01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:35.840
Lounge Radio is that Konami really badly needed to scrap their engine completely and rebuild

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.200
the game from the ground up.

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:41.200
And in a way, I think that's exactly what's going to happen here with what Activision

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:44.800
is doing is that they're going to take a dance game concept and rebuild it from the ground

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:45.800
up.

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:48.080
So that could be very interesting.

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:53.820
And I'm not ready to scream theft just yet, because I have a feeling this could be something

01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:54.820
kind of new and innovative.

01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:55.820
You know what I mean?

01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:56.820
I don't know.

01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:58.280
What do you guys think?

01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:07.600
New and innovative, from a company who ripped off Guitar Freak's Drummania and made it better,

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:08.600
might make it better.

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:09.600
Might make it better.

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:11.000
To be honest, I don't think they're really going to change.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.040
It's probably going to look like a Guitar Hero type of game, but instead of maybe, you

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:19.840
know, notes scrolling down the screen, it's going to be arrows or steps or feet or something,

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:22.160
I don't know, to that effect.

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:26.600
But I know, I hear you.

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.560
They're whoring the brand to death.

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.560
Seriously.

01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:30.560
Right, right.

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.480
You know, and I see all those concerns, but at the same time, I kind of feel like, oh,

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:37.320
somebody might be finally reinventing the approach to the dance game, because let's

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:44.440
face it, every other dance game that's come out, In the Groove, the, what am I thinking

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.440
of?

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.360
The freaking game that you can use your own CDs on that was terrible on the PS2.

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:50.840
What the hell was that game?

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:51.840
Dance Factory.

01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:54.200
Factory or whatever, yeah, Dance Factory or whatever.

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.300
They've all pretty much been the same damn thing.

01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:58.480
It's four arrows that you stomp to.

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:00.880
Well, maybe this could be something different.

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:04.920
Well, if we're going to go the Activision route, then it's going to have 80 billion

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:07.240
arrows and it's going to be fucking hard.

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:12.520
Now, I'm sorry, I just, it just seems like that they're really going, hey, these games

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:14.480
actually sell, you know?

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.880
Let's make a ton of them.

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.720
And, you know, I have no problem with them doing like DJ Hero, and if it's good, great,

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:21.640
then maybe I'll anticipate this game.

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:24.640
But I have a feeling it's not going to be that innovative.

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:27.920
DJ Hero sounds nothing like Beatmania.

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:33.400
That sounds like Guitar Hero, but exchange the guitar for a DJ turntable.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:38.240
I mean, seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if you could use the DJ turntable in Guitar

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:40.640
Hero because it probably is just another controller.

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:46.120
Instead of the strum bar, it's scratching, and instead of the fret buttons, it's keys.

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:47.120
Oh my God!

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:51.360
So much innovation, it blows my mind!

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:54.160
Will I be able to get star power too by shaking the turntable?

01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:58.040
Oh, well, maybe I'll have a crossfader for that, you know?

01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:00.520
God, I'm sorry.

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:01.520
I'm not interested.

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:02.520
What are they going to do?

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:03.520
I bet you, you know what?

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:07.320
They're going to, they're going to be able, they're, you know why?

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:11.040
Because they have Guitar Hero behind them, and they have these games behind them, they're

01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:15.500
going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted for DDR, and they're not going

01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:18.000
to have to fill up a song list with originals.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.320
Granted, we as DDR fans have come to know and love those Konami originals, but it's part

01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:24.680
of the reason why the game didn't sell us well over here.

01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:27.820
You know, they're having to rely on a lot of Japan-centric songs.

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:31.480
They're going to be able to license the songs we've always wanted in DDR.

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:32.480
And they know it.

01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:36.400
But half the fun was the songs that were created by the company themselves and their own in-house

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:37.880
artists.

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:41.440
They don't have any in-house artists, okay?

01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:42.440
They have...

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.440
That we know of.

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.540
They could be partnering up with something.

01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:48.800
I'm sorry, but even the best song list in the world is not going to make this game any

01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:49.800
good.

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:52.880
It's not going to have magic shoes you've got to buy, because you know this game's going

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:55.480
to have a damn peripheral attached to it, because how the hell are they going to be

01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:56.480
original?

01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:57.480
Magic shoes might be kind of fun.

01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:04.760
Okay, I have one absolute, one word that completely is an utter rebuttal to everything that Loki

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:07.120
is saying.

01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.200
Speculation.

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.200
It is.

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:11.200
It's all speculation.

01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.200
You don't...

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.200
Track record.

01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.200
They hoard this thing.

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:16.960
I swear to God, they hoard this thing so bad.

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:22.760
You watch next year when Guitar Hero has, oh, four to six game releases, and people

01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:24.440
are going, my God.

01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:29.240
I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero...

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.240
Five cents.

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.240
I would...

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:32.240
No, more than that.

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:35.560
I would bet a significant sum of money that DJ Hero will sell more copies in the Beat

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:36.560
Mania video in this country.

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:37.560
Fifty cents.

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:38.960
Yeah, I can guarantee that will happen.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:43.840
And I don't know if I can make the same thing for Dance Hero, because it has done very,

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:44.840
very well in places too.

01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:46.280
But DJ Hero will sell by its name alone.

01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:49.680
It could be the worst game ever, but people go, oh my God, I want to be a DJ.

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:51.560
But what if it's not bad?

01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:53.960
I'm not saying DJ Hero will be bad.

01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:55.840
I'm saying Dance Hero will be bad.

01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.000
What if it's not?

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.240
It's gonna suck.

01:56:58.240 --> 01:56:59.240
It's gonna suck.

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:00.240
All right.

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:01.240
Big time.

01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:07.560
If it sells more than, okay, how many copies of Guitar Hero, the first Guitar Hero sold?

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.560
Oh, I don't know.

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:12.800
When, during its first month of release?

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:15.360
Not enough until it went on 360.

01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.360
I don't think.

01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.920
Well, plus they had to get the first game out there to license the songs everybody wanted

01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:20.920
to play.

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.920
It doesn't matter anyways.

01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:22.920
Because this game will never...

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:30.440
So if it, say that it sells more in its first month than Guitar Hero did.

01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:33.400
Dance Hero will not sell more than Guitar Hero did in its first month.

01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:34.400
Do you bet your...

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.400
Oh.

01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:36.400
Oh.

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:37.400
Oh.

01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:38.400
Oh.

01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:39.400
No.

01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:40.400
I disagree, sir.

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:41.400
I think there's a bet forming here.

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:42.400
No, there is not a bet forming here.

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:44.120
The only bet is the Eye of Judgment, okay?

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:48.000
This is just a registered trademark, we don't know what this is at all, and we don't even

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000
know if it will come out.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000
So why are you thinking that it's gonna...

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Well, okay, so...

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.560
Because I saw the Eye of Judgment, I'm like, wow, that is a piece of shit.

01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:56.800
I mean, I even said, what is the point of this game?

01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:58.460
But you haven't seen Dance Hero.

01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:00.560
You don't know anything about it other than a name.

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:01.560
I know.

01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:04.840
I don't know anything about it except for the name, but I know the track record of what

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:07.560
they're doing with Guitar Hero, and how they're looking at...

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:08.560
Guitar Hero was good.

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:09.560
All right.

01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:13.040
Yeah, Guitar Hero was good, but see, the problem is they're looking at what Konami has done

01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:16.120
with their games and just kind of trying to mimic it.

01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:17.840
But that doesn't mean it's not gonna be good.

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:22.080
Yeah, we can go ahead and take the devil's advocate thing, but the fact of the matter

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:26.360
is they need a peripheral with every one of these fucking hero games, so what is the magic

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:29.760
peripheral that's gonna come along with this, and really, is it gonna innovate anything

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.720
other than having a better song list?

01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:32.720
Eye Toy.

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:38.040
It'll use the Eye Toy, and you can wave your hands around and wiggle your butt.

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.840
To be honest, this game will not probably hit until like 2010 anyways, so what do I

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:42.840
even care?

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:45.640
We haven't had a good argument here on OLR in a long time.

01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:46.640
This is nice.

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:51.520
But I will fucking say I told you so when this game comes out and it's a piece of shit.

01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:55.200
I will rub it in your face like dirty feces.

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:56.920
You know what, though?

01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.920
Everything's a matter of...

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:00.280
Track record is two words, speculation is one word.

01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.800
You were supposed to sum it up in one word, therefore you are disqualified, and your opinion

01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:05.200
is thrown out.

01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:08.000
I make my own damn rules.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.080
That's okay, because we're entitled to make our own rules and change them at will.

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:18.560
You lose, a man will never win an argument with a woman, because we are awesome and men

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:19.560
aren't.

01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:20.560
Sorry.

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:21.560
Wow.

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:22.560
You should know that.

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:23.560
You're married.

01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:24.560
Yeah.

01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:29.120
Nellie, if you're listening, come up here and lay down the law.

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:30.120
All right.

01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:31.120
Wow.

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.120
All right.

01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:33.120
You know what?

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:34.120
You know what?

01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:35.120
Lots of good...

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:36.120
You know what?

01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:38.960
Whether you agree with Loki or not, you know, lots of good points being brought up around

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:41.520
the board, and I'm sure we're gonna have some calls on it later as well.

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:45.840
Well, I mean, no offense to the answer, but I think the logical step for them would be

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:48.520
to do like a keyboard hero, because that's at least something you can add.

01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:50.080
Because we haven't had keyboard mania.

01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:53.280
Well, we haven't had DDR either.

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:54.280
Seriously?

01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:59.000
Fuck Konami with a big chainsaw for disbanding that series, because keyboard mania I was

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
actually pretty good at, and it pisses me off.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.800
Who is in charge of the DDR series now?

02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:04.760
Is it like on autopilot or something?

02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:06.360
Because I mean, what is seriously happening?

02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.360
I don't know.

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:10.440
But okay, besides all that, I really do think that they should bring like a keyboard thing

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:15.640
up, because then that way you can add it to, you know, Guitar Hero World Tour or whatever,

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:16.920
and you can have keyboards with a lot of stuff.

02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:19.880
Who doesn't want to play Van Halen's jump with a keyboard mania?

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:21.160
We need Sax Maniacs.

02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:22.160
All right.

02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:26.440
All right, now this is gonna lead to Bagpipe Hero and Didgeridoo Hero.

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:27.440
All right.

02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:28.440
It's our hero.

02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:30.800
Let's move on.

02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:31.800
We've got...

02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:32.800
Oh, they made a sitar hero, remember?

02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:33.800
Yeah, online.

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:35.400
That was for the guru of love.

02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:40.240
All right, we're gonna move on to the email bag, because I'm sure this whole subject's

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.000
gonna get brought up again during the phone calls, so we'll come back round two later

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
on.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000
But for now, round one is over.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.320
All right, let's go to the mail bag.

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:55.400
Every week, you guys email us at mailbagatorangelaundry.com, and DarkSakura dives in the mail bag and reads

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:58.920
a few of her favorites after she drinks some soda.

02:00:58.920 --> 02:00:59.920
Well, the music's playing.

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:00.920
What are we gonna do?

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:01.920
Just sit here and wait?

02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:03.920
Well, we can stare at the ants.

02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:05.800
Is there more ants now?

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:08.120
Yeah, but they're attacking something on the floor, and I don't really know what.

02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:10.000
I saw like a trail of them.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
They're running over there.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I'm off to get the raid.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.960
Oh, I can't, because I don't smell like raid in here.

02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:14.960
God damn it.

02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:15.960
They're just like...

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:16.960
Okay.

02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:17.960
How about a fire?

02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:18.960
Email time.

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:19.960
Let's set fire to the...

02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:20.960
Let's set fire to the floor and burn all the ants.

02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:23.720
Did you ever watch that YouTube video of the guy burning the hornet's nest on his child's

02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:24.720
swing set?

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:25.720
Oh my gosh.

02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:28.600
Setting it on fire with as many different flammable things as he could find?

02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:29.600
I was like, stupid?

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:32.600
I don't know, but I think I'll be looking that up right now.

02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:33.600
Okay.

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:34.600
Setting fire to swing set.

02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:36.720
Look up fucking moron and you'll find him.

02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:38.560
Well, that could be a ton of videos on there.

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:40.120
I got to look fire swing set.

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.120
Okay.

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.520
I think it's fire and hornets, but anyway.

02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:47.960
First email comes from Hunter Red, aka Redertainment.

02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:50.240
Hey y'all.

02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.600
You know, I can't say y'all without saying it in accent.

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:54.600
Y'all.

02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:59.720
As you know, the season where the masses choose which douchebag will represent them is upon

02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:01.760
us and I have the question to that end.

02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:07.320
I'm going to send an email to all the douchebags running for Congress in my district and I

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:12.200
want to ask them how they feel about video games and the legislation that is currently

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.800
pending about them.

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:17.000
Is there a way I should phrase my email so that I can get a response from them other

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.320
than not calling them douchebags?

02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.960
That's going to smell, man.

02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:25.000
I would have done it, but it'll smell.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Point point.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.200
I know that because illustrated quite well.

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:35.840
By the way, Sky, that means you, mister, I've left the studio to try to set fire to the

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:36.840
ants.

02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:37.840
I've left the studio to fire.

02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:42.480
By the way, Sky, if you hate the influence of the Mormon Church in politics in California,

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:43.680
you should come to Utah.

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:45.680
They're everywhere and are everything.

02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:51.600
No, I've heard about Utah and it's, you know, it's just, you know, you guys, if you listen

02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:55.160
to the show last week, you already know how I feel about Proposition 8 and how it's, you

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:59.360
know, setting civil rights back about 50 years, but you know, what can you do?

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:03.760
Honestly, if you want to see the influence of the Mormon Church, just go talk to a boy,

02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:07.440
you know, boy scout troop.

02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.440
Thanks love the show.

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:12.000
You do what I ask for any podcasts I listen to at work to do, inform, entertain and make

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
me laugh.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.400
Thanks again, Hunter Red, aka Redertainment.

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.480
You're welcome.

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:19.480
Next one.

02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:20.480
Yes.

02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:25.920
Hey guys, Dan Shadow here with your helpful hints for Warhammer Online.

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:30.640
There are thousands of Tome unlocks and hundreds of titles you can earn.

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:34.560
I'm going to help you get some of the nicer title unlocks.

02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:37.480
First take off all your clothes.

02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:41.360
Second use a hundred abilities to be known as the show off.

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.260
Third talk to a hundred citizens while naked to be a flirt.

02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:49.400
If you target another naked player a hundred times, you'll become the ogler.

02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:53.240
If you want to get a nice title that doesn't involve nudity, then jump off a cliff and

02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.240
die.

02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:59.240
If you do this 25 times, you can have the word floating above your head.

02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:00.920
That's all the helpful hints for this week.

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:04.800
I just got into the little big planet beta, so I'll let you guys know how that one goes

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:05.800
when I can.

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:06.800
See ya.

02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:10.160
I want to be in the little big planet beta so that I don't even have a PS3.

02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:12.360
I just want a key to say I'm in it and you're not.

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:15.920
I want to be in a game and have ahhhh floating over my head.

02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:18.240
Or remember there was an impossible mission.

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.600
You've been listening to Orange Lounge.

02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:23.880
No, OLR's not over, sorry.

02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:24.880
And the show's canceled.

02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:26.920
Good night, everyone.

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:28.640
Next email.

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:33.120
My question for OLR this week is, do you guys have a backlog of video games to play slash

02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:34.720
finish and how large is the backlog?

02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:36.920
Oh shit, you really want me to answer that?

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:41.000
Personally I have a backlog on PS2 and even on the Xbox 360, which I only purchased a

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000
couple months ago.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.800
The majority are some RPGs and some action games.

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:48.760
I feel that DDR and World of Warcraft sometimes eat up a lot of my free time, but I'm not

02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:51.220
sure what stops me from finishing some games.

02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:56.240
As promised, Triple A'd an old school DDR song, Burnin' the Floor, in honor of OLR and 300th

02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:57.240
Show.

02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.120
You actually sent a picture of it, too.

02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:03.160
This email is brought to you by Dark Sakura School of Dancing Ferrets.

02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:05.960
Peace out and Triple A'd, Jammer Jones.

02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:11.760
Off the top of my head, Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, Final Fantasy XII, they're all games

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:12.760
I need to finish.

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.240
Kingdom Hearts 2, shit, I never finished that one.

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:15.720
I got really far and I didn't finish it.

02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:17.000
There's tons of games I need to finish.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
I have a gaming ADD.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.080
I've said it a million times on this show.

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:22.080
Especially this time of year.

02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.080
That's a huge ass freaking picture.

02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:26.400
How can you play just one game this time of year?

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:30.040
It seems like every week leading up to Christmas, there's a new freaking game coming out that

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:31.040
I have to play.

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:34.960
Like Fable 2 is coming out soon, and I barely have touched Warhammer or Spore, even.

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:39.200
I think I've sunk maybe five hours into Spore, tops, and already there's new games coming

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:40.520
out I want.

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:42.800
That's just the way it goes, isn't it?

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:55.440
But he sent us quite the massive image of his Triple A, but it is there with 309 perfect

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:57.680
steps and a perfect score.

02:05:57.680 --> 02:05:59.680
Well done to you.

02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:01.320
Here's the big one.

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:02.320
Strong Bad.

02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:03.320
The episodic Strong Bad's games.

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:06.400
I freaking know people that have worked on those games and I keep saying I'm going to

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:08.480
support them and I want to play the games.

02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:12.200
I haven't even touched them yet, just because there's been so much else that have been grabbing

02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:13.200
my attention.

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:15.720
But I really do want to play the Strong Bad games at some point.

02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:19.840
My present backlog is I actually do want to go back and finish Kingdom Hearts 2.

02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:23.280
And I actually never finished Final Fantasy X because I got so pissed off that I'd rushed

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:29.040
through leveling the game that I got to one of the battles with what's his stupid face

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:31.120
with his ugly blue hair.

02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:34.400
And I got to the Glyph Mine battle, passed that, and none of my characters were high

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:38.040
enough to stand one hit, so that's my own bad.

02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:44.560
And I still have to finish Kingdom Hearts 2, but I glitched the game, like in a major

02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:45.560
way.

02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:46.560
Nice.

02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:51.100
I skipped some level and now I can't get into doing the Pride Lands.

02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:53.360
So it's pretty stupid.

02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:58.120
I think I did like Halloween Town twice in a row or something, but right now I still

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:03.200
have to get started on The World Ends With You, which I finally have, I'm so happy.

02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:08.820
And I'm also playing through Final Fantasy VI and I'm still trying to find the stupid

02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:12.680
way back to whatever the Narshe Town is.

02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:18.320
So it goes to show just how long it's been since I've played that damn game.

02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:19.320
Next email?

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.320
Next email.

02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:24.760
I was just wondering, and I just started listening to the podcast, so I'm not certain if you

02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:28.720
guys have talked about this, what you guys thought about the makers of Psychonauts making

02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:29.720
a sequel.

02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:34.520
Seeing as how I think it was rated as 14th greatest Xbox, even though it wasn't a great

02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:39.360
seller to my knowledge, Xbox Live gamertag quick sticks.

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:43.400
Excellent question, and you know, that's another one of those games I didn't play a lot of.

02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:47.520
I have played Psychonauts, just not a lot in depth.

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:52.960
I don't see how it's a bad thing though, Psychonauts had a lot of fans, and a lot of people have

02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:55.600
been slowly discovering that game over the years.

02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:58.320
It's kind of like a cult game, like a cult movie.

02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:02.080
Not a lot of people see it when it first comes out, but it sells really well on DVD.

02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:04.080
People wanted to go back and check it out later, that's kind of what Psychonauts is.

02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:08.160
It's one of those games that people get together and sacrifice virgins on altars in the basement

02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:09.160
of their buildings.

02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:11.240
And drink the Kool-Aid, no, it's not that kind of game.

02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:18.720
But I didn't play enough of the first one to really say, oh, I'm excited about a sequel.

02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:22.660
But I know that the first game was unique enough with a cool sense of humor about it

02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:25.840
that I think a second game will be welcomed, and I bet you more people check out the sequel

02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:27.080
than the first one.

02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:30.200
And making a sequel, honestly, will get more people to check out the original, which is

02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:35.320
available as an Xbox Live original, if I'm not mistaken.

02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:40.560
One of our listeners, I guess, I'm never quite sure how to pronounce it, but I think it's

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:41.560
Neige.

02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:47.760
But anyway, one of our British listeners saw a story on the BBC News website and linked

02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:54.520
it to us, which is a Germany arrest over gamer death, where a man is arrested in Germany

02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:59.680
on suspicion of the murder of a 20-year-old internet gamer in Nottingham.

02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:04.960
Checking out the article as soon as it loads up.

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:10.520
And I'll link the article in the chat room, since it's very nice to share that with us.

02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:12.600
As soon as the damn thing loads.

02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:18.120
Matthew Pike, 20, was found stabbed in his flat above the Orange Tree Pub on North Sherwood

02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:19.880
Street on Friday.

02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:28.920
So the one arrested was a guy from Lindbergh, and apparently they, I guess, played the game

02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:29.920
together or something.

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.120
I'm not seeing what game was listed in it, but they were friends over the internet and

02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:38.360
played games together, and dude's like, whatever, die, and kill him.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:42.320
At least, that's what they're thinking so far.

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:45.600
So I'll link the article in the chat.

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:49.520
That's sad, and stupid.

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:53.080
So does that mean if you can't beat them, you should gank them?

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:54.080
Nice.

02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:58.560
But thank you for sharing that with us.

02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:04.120
Also cheeseburger, somebody go smack cheeseburger around with the large child in the chat room

02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:07.120
for me, because the email was dongle.

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:12.160
No, that was worth a day two weeks ago.

02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:15.080
When I got my Bluetooth dongle back in the day when I thought I could use it to transfer

02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:20.680
stuff on my phone, I thought that that was the single most freaking hilarious word in

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.680
the universe.

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:27.080
Because I mean, just saying dongle, it's almost as much fun as saying balls.

02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:28.080
Last email.

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:29.080
Alrighty.

02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:31.080
This comes from Isabelle.

02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:34.880
These are just some photos me and my friend took for Pyramid Head Day.

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:39.120
We made cupcakes with little pyramid head heads on top of them, and I made a pyramid

02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:40.400
head costume.

02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:41.520
Happy Pyramid Head Day.

02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:43.580
Hope Silent Hill Homecoming is awesome.

02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:46.880
But none of you get to see them, because I haven't actually uploaded them anywhere.

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:49.080
They're on our email.

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:54.520
But they are funny and cute, and Pyramid Head is tasty delicious.

02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:58.440
Hooray for Pyramid Head Day.

02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:03.380
Well I'm really glad that people actually went and celebrated Pyramid Head Day.

02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:04.380
That's wonderful.

02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:06.640
I hope we get more pictures of the coming weeks.

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:07.840
It's Pee-Hitty Day.

02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:08.840
Pee-Hitty Day.

02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:11.000
Vote or Pee-Hitty will kill you.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Seriously.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.560
That's it?

02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:14.560
For email.

02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:18.440
Alright, if you want to send us an email next time, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:21.320
Wouldn't it be Pee-Hitty?

02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:22.320
Shut up.

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:23.320
I don't know.

02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:24.320
You know what it is?

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.320
It's whatever I say it is.

02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:28.600
It's whatever you say it is.

02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:29.600
Nice.

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:37.600
As before the mailbag, we were talking a little bit about some game companies, and of course

02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:43.760
other game companies, other than Activision, but I'm sure they agree on this, Bungee.

02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:50.080
The game developer believes that game companies should pocket money from used game sales.

02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:57.980
And it seems, I guess, that they feel since the used sales, like for example, had a big

02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:05.000
impact on Halo, and when you have a multi-million dollar seller game, and I guess they're losing

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:10.720
money on used copies of the game, because people buy those instead of a new copy, and

02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:19.680
you can thank GameStop for a lot of that too, they feel that they want a piece of that pie.

02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:24.940
So I think they're wrong though, because that's retarded.

02:12:24.940 --> 02:12:29.160
If I buy something and I sell it to somebody else, why should you get a piece of that?

02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:35.800
Yeah, like if I sell my refrigerator to someone else, because I'm going to get a newer, fancier

02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:39.360
refrigerator, I don't have to send Maytag 20 bucks.

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.360
You know what I mean?

02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:45.400
Yeah, it's basically like, you know, I saw some comments or something, talkbacks about

02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:51.120
it, and it's like, you own your money 100%, and it's all bartering basically, because

02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:55.880
you're trading your money for 100% ownership of said game.

02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:02.080
So if they want a portion of when you sell that game, then you should get a portion of

02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:05.840
the money that they spend on, say, when they buy groceries.

02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:08.480
CD industries had to deal with this for years, it hasn't killed them.

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.720
Piracy killed the CD industry.

02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:11.720
Exactly.

02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:18.060
I think, I mean, used game sales can be good, because you say a consumer doesn't really

02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:22.840
want to buy your game at full price, and say they buy Halo 1, and then they'll like it,

02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:25.840
and then they go out and buy Halo 2 when it comes out.

02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:26.840
So it's extra sales.

02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:31.080
I don't see how this is a bad thing, and besides, you already got paid, okay?

02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:36.620
I mean, why are they even complaining about the fact that they don't sell as many units?

02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:39.680
Because they've already sold those units to retail stores.

02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:46.200
The retail stores now have to sell them, you know, and if they decide to sell used games

02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:51.000
over new games, like a lot of these game stores like GameStop, they push their used sales,

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.140
in fact, if they have a used copy in, they'll be like, hey, do you want the used copy instead?

02:13:56.140 --> 02:13:59.060
They push those first because they're making more money off of them anyways, so what's

02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:00.060
it matter?

02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:03.960
Because they've already paid you for the product, you're not losing out on anything.

02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:08.200
The Rob D. has an interesting comment in chat, guess what, developers, DLC exists, give us

02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:09.560
a reason to keep it.

02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:11.320
Even better, make additional content free.

02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:12.320
Exactly.

02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:13.320
Give us a reason to keep your game.

02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:16.360
Just build the contents where it's at, because that's a way you can make more money off of

02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:18.160
each game you sell.

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:21.000
I don't know.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.680
But yeah, I definitely don't think that they should ever get to the point where they have

02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:27.040
to, you know, get a portion of used sales.

02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:28.040
That's just stupid.

02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:33.560
Alright, well, moving on to people that want, other people that want a piece of the pie.

02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:40.600
Activision Blizzard has gone on the record, the CEO Bobby Kotick has said some, basically

02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:48.200
a response to what the Warner Music executive Edgar Bronfman said previously, and what he

02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:52.080
had said was that the royalty rates for songs that are used in like Guitar Hero, Rock Band

02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:55.080
and so on are paltry.

02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:57.720
Basically that they're getting paid peanuts, they're not getting paid enough money for

02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:59.440
using the music in these games.

02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:04.400
Well, the Activision CEO, Bobby Kotick, has come back and said the comment was one-sided.

02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:09.640
In fact, he says that these games that have the licensed tracks in them, they have a significant

02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:13.040
impact on the record and ticket sales of the contributing artist.

02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:17.880
So he's kind of thinking aloud, maybe that the musicians, quote, should be paying any

02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:22.200
money, or I'm sorry, the companies, quote, should be paying any money at all to the musicians,

02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.480
and whether it should be the reverse.

02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:27.720
Maybe people should be paying them to put their songs in the game.

02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:29.640
It's like free advertising.

02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:34.880
No, because the songs make the game, and if, you know, you want to take that route and

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:39.480
like, well, we're not going to put any songs in our game unless you pay us to do it, yeah,

02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:41.960
go right ahead and see what your song list looks like then.

02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:42.960
Right.

02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:43.960
That's a very good point.

02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:46.160
Without these songs, then the game is going to be nothing, but at the same time, there's

02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:50.560
kind of a fine line here, because I think if these guys get too greedy, you know, especially

02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:54.920
if it's one company over the others, then, you know, they'll be able to still put out

02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:59.480
a perfectly solid game from, you know, music from other labels that are out there.

02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:03.880
Well, just look at some other, like, other companies doing similar things.

02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:07.720
GameStop, and I'm sure this is true for a lot of other retailers as well, they charge

02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:10.660
companies to put their games in the store.

02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:12.960
They charge them for shelf space.

02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:16.920
They actually, when they have, like, signage in their store for a certain game, they make

02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:20.120
those companies pay for that signage to be in their store.

02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:22.120
I mean, that's just ridiculous.

02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.900
It's the same thing with this.

02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:27.040
They're saying, oh, well, our game is, you know, immensely popular, and because of it,

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.680
your music is becoming more popular.

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:32.540
Well, the reason people buy that game in the first place is because of your song list,

02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:36.920
and if your song list sucks, then people won't buy your game, and then you won't have your

02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:40.080
popularity.

02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:45.280
In my mind, both sides stand to lose something if they can't agree on it.

02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:49.320
And I would say, then, here's what I think it should say the way it is.

02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:53.920
You're paying royalties, but they're not that big because in the back end, you know, obviously

02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:57.800
there's a reason why they're licensing their music to these games is because they know

02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:03.400
the benefit of putting their songs in there, because it does, you know, drive up interest

02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:08.520
in certain bands and maybe introduce new bands that some people may not have decided to listen

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:09.520
to before.

02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:10.880
I don't know.

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:13.800
It's not a bad thing for either company, but as soon as they start getting greedy, that's

02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:16.200
when it's going to fall apart.

02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:21.200
SonicM88 in chat says, over at chat.orangelandrater.com, says, I discovered a lot of great songs in

02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:22.200
the Guitar Hero games.

02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:26.320
I love playing the game despite the fact that I didn't know most of the songs.

02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:29.360
So you know, but there are some music game fans that are going to play these games no

02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:31.840
matter what, even if they don't know a single song in them.

02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:35.600
But I think certainly part of the reason why Guitar Hero really kind of broke out in some

02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:39.200
sense is because it was a lot of those songs you've always wanted to play on the guitar.

02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:40.200
You know what I mean?

02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:43.400
Plus they did a really good job marketing their game.

02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:46.320
I think as well, they got it out there in the press.

02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:49.660
You remember like, you remember when that guy went over to Jamie's house and you guys

02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:53.560
got interviewed for the news, that was probably because Red Octane put out a press release

02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:56.280
about the game and was able to kind of call attention to it.

02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:57.280
You know what I mean?

02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:01.320
They were very good at getting themselves in the papers and everything.

02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:02.320
Just kind of a thought.

02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.320
It's also pretty fun.

02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:10.560
I mean, on top of that, it just seemed to me like there was a much better appreciation,

02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:15.040
you know, to the gamers themselves that actually wanted to work with the community.

02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:16.040
Right.

02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:18.360
Alright, well let's move on with some more news.

02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:19.360
Okay.

02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:26.160
Well, um, Ghostbusters game, you know, they were working on the game and Bill Murray did

02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:30.900
his vocal recording, but he was also quoted as saying that he would be actually, he had

02:18:30.900 --> 02:18:36.760
such a good time in recording his voice and reprising his character's, you know, his character

02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:41.160
role that he'd actually like to do another Ghostbusters movie.

02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:46.480
So, you know, for all those rumors floating around about another Ghostbusters movie, that

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:50.940
might actually be a little bit more likely, maybe.

02:18:50.940 --> 02:18:51.940
We hope.

02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:56.160
As long as he's not too old for it.

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:57.640
Well, we'll see.

02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:01.680
Maybe he's realizing that some of these other movies he's making aren't exactly as good

02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:05.800
as, you know, he hasn't exactly been on a big movie streak lately.

02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:06.800
I don't know.

02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:10.120
I just couldn't see that Ghostbusters 3 would actually be that big of a movie if they did

02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:11.120
one.

02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:12.120
You know what I mean?

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:14.760
Maybe a lot of it depends on star power and who they get in the movie, but if they don't

02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:18.280
have the right people in the movie, I don't know if there'd really be that much interest

02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:19.440
in a Ghostbusters 3.

02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:21.120
You know what I mean?

02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:24.260
Tiger Claw says there is a third Ghostbusters movie in the works that's being written by

02:19:24.260 --> 02:19:25.260
the writers of The Office.

02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:26.960
Wasn't that only a rumor?

02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:27.960
I think that was a rumor.

02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:28.960
I don't know.

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:29.960
Hm.

02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:35.440
Anyways, there's one of the games that they were talking about at E3 that was Mag, the

02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:40.780
massive, I don't know, massive action game, I guess, I can't remember what it stood for,

02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:45.040
but it will apparently be not free to play.

02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:53.760
They are gonna plan on charging either a yearly or monthly fee, and they'll also have, I guess,

02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:57.440
one-time fees for content downloads as well.

02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:05.240
And also, I guess it mentions that they may have hosting partners, like EA and Activision.

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:06.240
Hm.

02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:13.200
But, I don't know, I guess this is sort of, it didn't really seem like an MMO to me, but

02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:17.320
it is kind of surprising though that an online game like this won't be free to play, but

02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:22.000
I guess when you have 256 players, you probably need some serious network hardware for that.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Hm.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I don't know.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.280
We'll just hopefully make the game cheap to buy then, if that's the case, you know, like

02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:31.440
Warhawk or something where it's 40 bucks and it says 60.

02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:32.440
Yeah.

02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.440
Alright.

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:35.920
Well, remember when we used to learn a lot of things from our games?

02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:39.800
Well, there was a little piece that's been circulating around different gaming blogs

02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:40.800
this week.

02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:45.760
It's from the Educational Games Research blog, which kind of puts out information regularly

02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:47.360
about educational games.

02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:51.560
They compiled a list this week, the top 10 most influential educational video games from

02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:52.560
the 1980s.

02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:54.680
Now, keep in mind, it's just one guy's opinion.

02:20:54.680 --> 02:21:00.340
It's someone who kind of, I guess, writes about education-related video games, not every

02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:02.000
now and then, but it's one guy's opinion.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.520
This is the top 10 most educational games in his mind.

02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:07.040
The Oregon Trail, of course, is number one.

02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:08.320
I mean, who doesn't remember that game?

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:09.320
Hello.

02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:11.360
Because we've all died of dysentery at one time or another.

02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:15.400
Number two, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, which came up on last week's show, funny

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:16.400
enough.

02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:18.480
Number three, SimCity.

02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:19.480
Number four, ReaderRabbit.

02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:21.840
Remember ReaderRabbit?

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:27.080
Number five, MathBlaster, which was very similar to ReaderRabbit, or no, no, it weren't that

02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:29.720
they were similar, but it seems like both those games were kind of like hand-in-hand

02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:30.720
games.

02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:32.680
I don't know about you guys, but it seemed like when I was younger, those games kind

02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:33.760
of were hand-in-hand.

02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:36.920
Number six, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.

02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:39.940
Number seven, Lemonade Stand.

02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:42.400
Number eight, Number Munchers.

02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:43.780
Number nine, Zork.

02:21:43.780 --> 02:21:47.580
I don't know if I'd call that an educational game, but I guess maybe because of the fact

02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:50.200
you actually had to type out your words and thoughts.

02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:55.120
And number 10, which I find very strange, Windows Solitaire.

02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:58.900
I guess that's something that you're supposed to, you learn how to use the mouse with it,

02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:02.600
so it's an educational game, which I can see that, but it's just very odd to see that on

02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:03.600
this list.

02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:08.720
And number 11, M-U-L-E, which is strange because it's a top 10 list, but they put Mule on this

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:13.080
list as well, which is a great game that I guess, you know, you kind of learn about barter

02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:16.880
and exchange in that game, but I don't know if I'd call that an educational game either.

02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:20.760
Of particular interest, why this story kind of piqued my interest, because I've seen this

02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:24.200
around on different gaming blog sites this week.

02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:30.080
I tackled this same topic a year ago on my personal blog that I was running for a while

02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:33.040
back when the All Games Radio Ning site was a little more popular.

02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:35.160
In fact, I'll link it here in chat.

02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:40.360
You can actually read my list here, and sorry for those guys that are listening on the podcast,

02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:46.240
you can't see this, but just go to allgamesradio.ning.com and look for my profile and you'll find this.

02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:50.400
This was my list of the top 10 edutainment games of all time, because I used to play

02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:51.920
a lot of them growing up.

02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:55.680
Number 10, The Incredible Machine, which I've noticed was missing from that list, but I

02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:59.200
think it's because he was doing a list from the 1980s and I did like an all-encompassing

02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:00.200
list.

02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:03.920
But I thought The Incredible Machine was definitely an educational game.

02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:09.640
Rocky's Boots was number nine on my list because I felt that Rocky's Boots, especially for

02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:13.680
somebody who's into computers, you learn a lot about logic in this game, which leads

02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:16.960
to programming, and Rocky's Boots is a hell of a lot of fun.

02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:20.460
Number eight, it's just Apple logo, because it was kind of like your first programming

02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:22.520
language that you would learn in school.

02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:25.460
Number seven, I also put Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.

02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:28.120
Number six, I also put Math Blasters.

02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:32.600
Number five, I put a game called Cave of the Word Wizard, that was a game that you had

02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:36.080
on the Commodore 64, and what made this game notable is that it actually used the Commodore

02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:40.720
64 speech chip to actually say the names of words that you would have to spell out to

02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:45.880
the word wizard, where he'd take away your flashlight battery, and then if your battery

02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:48.960
goes out, you basically die of death.

02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.280
You get eaten alive by bats.

02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:53.160
No, I don't know, but you don't want your flashlight battery to run out.

02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:56.960
And I put number four, where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego.

02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:02.000
Number three, The Island of Dr. Brain, that was a great educational title, again, it wasn't

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.400
the 80s, that's probably why it wasn't on the other guy's list.

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:08.080
And then I put number two, Number Munchers, and number one, The Oregon Trail.

02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:13.760
So kind of funny that I don't profess to be an educational games expert, yet my list was

02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:17.040
pretty similar, except for the fact that I had a couple games from the 90s in there.

02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:21.820
So I don't know, I just thought I'd share that, because nobody read the article when

02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:23.480
I posted it the first time, so.

02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:26.480
Where's Leisure Suit Larry?

02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:28.560
It's not an educational game, Loki.

02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:35.680
I don't care what you think you learned from it, it is not technically an educational game.

02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:39.120
And Mae Satsuma is looking at my blog saying, man, did Number Munchers really look that

02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:40.120
bad?

02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:41.240
Yes it did, the first version did.

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:44.500
They made prettier versions of it as time went on, but the very first version was very

02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:47.920
plain looking, it was Atari 2600 style graphics.

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:52.040
Alright, enough about educational games, let's get back to brain rotting games.

02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:56.520
Hey, it's not brain rotting, it's just, well, violent.

02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:58.640
And violence is always good.

02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:02.360
It helps release tension or something.

02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:05.960
Well basically, this is some very good news.

02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:11.640
For all of those people who had always, you know, had the, you must defeat Shen Long to

02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:17.180
stand a chance and thinking he was a, you know, this was a hidden character or something.

02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:25.920
Actually Goken, who was supposed to be Ryu and Ken's teacher, is going to be a hidden

02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:30.000
character in the game, but he's not playable, he's just going to show up every so often

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.600
and beat the crap out of you.

02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:33.600
Toasty.

02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:42.680
But it is, there is an unlock procedure for it, but he's going to be hardcore tough.

02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:43.680
Sweet.

02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:46.640
So yeah, that's pretty happy.

02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:51.080
Of course, you know, I have a feeling that someone's going to find some way to control

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:52.320
him, blah blah blah.

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:53.960
Or he'll be a download character.

02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:56.800
Yep, pay to unlock.

02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:03.080
Well, if it's, you know, if there's going to be another Grand Theft Auto game coming

02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:06.140
out, then there's got to be another controversy coming with it.

02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:09.780
And of course, with the announcement of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, and now that more

02:26:09.780 --> 02:26:13.840
details are leaking out about it, people are throwing a fit.

02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:19.080
In fact, the British tabloid The Sun, which for some reason is now covering video game

02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:29.160
stuff every now and then, has a headline called Fury Over Drug Deal Vid Game, and of course

02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:36.760
includes comments from a guy named Darren Gold of a support group called Drugsline,

02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:41.200
and anything using drug dealing as entertainment is sending out the wrong message.

02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:47.680
Glamorism doesn't help our work in trying to educate kids of the dangers of substance

02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:49.160
misuse.

02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:50.680
Awesome!

02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:51.680
And you know what?

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:56.580
I agree with you in the fact that kids should be taught about, you know, drugs and how bad

02:26:56.580 --> 02:26:57.580
they are and stuff.

02:26:57.580 --> 02:27:02.700
The other thing is kids should be playing this game because it's rated M. So, my God,

02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:03.700
people please.

02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:10.200
And in case, if you didn't notice, you can sell drugs in this game because Grand Theft

02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:15.040
Auto likes to piss people off and controversy sells, so awesome.

02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:19.240
But remember, parents, the ratings are on the box for a reason.

02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:22.040
And you know, if you don't really give a shit about the ratings, then do your kids a favor

02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:23.440
and buy them porn.

02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:28.360
DJ Dark Knight in chat says, winners don't use drugs.

02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:30.240
Remember the old FBI warning?

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:33.520
Which by the way, have you ever noticed that in, I don't think it's in Rock Band 1, but

02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.660
in Rock Band 2, there's an arcade level that you play in, and you can, if you actually

02:27:37.660 --> 02:27:41.580
look at the screens, one of them has that little FBI warning on it that says winners

02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:42.580
don't use drugs.

02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:44.000
I thought that was pretty awesome.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.960
Kudos to whoever at Harmonix snuck that in.

02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:49.160
Good job, you.

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:53.480
Tigerclaw posted a link in chat of some pictures of the drug dealing mini-game.

02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:57.360
Which is strange because haven't no pictures of this game been released?

02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:58.360
No, they have been.

02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:04.960
They were in a game magazine called Game, was it Nintendo Power, yes, I'm sure no one's

02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:05.960
heard of it.

02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:06.960
Nice.

02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:10.280
And it would not be addressed to children at all.

02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:12.700
No, but seriously though, it's a mature rated game.

02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:13.700
Come on, folks.

02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:16.280
I mean, do you really need to know what Grand Theft Auto is?

02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:20.240
I mean, are you really assuming that it's like Grand Theft Auto babies or something

02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:23.880
like that because it's coming to the DS that might be friendly for kids?

02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:25.920
That they're just stealing lunch money or something?

02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:27.760
I mean, come on.

02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:33.440
Alright, well, one- It's like saying, oh my god, fire's hot.

02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:36.500
One more piece of- It is?

02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:39.160
One more piece of kind of late breaking news for you guys.

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:45.480
It's very big rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor, apparently over at an Xbox India event that

02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:52.280
have happened over in Delhi, India, apparently has been confirmed, I use that term loosely

02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:59.000
though, that there will be a slim Xbox 360 console that will be released in 2009.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.400
This is coming from some Indian gaming blogs.

02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:06.240
Apparently they are also saying that India is going to be getting some time with Fable

02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:11.760
2, Gears of War 2, and Fallout 3 a week earlier than supposedly anyone else is supposed to

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:12.760
be.

02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:13.760
Hmm.

02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:14.760
I'm quite skeptical.

02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:17.200
Well, they may get to try it a week before it comes out, but big deal.

02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:19.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:20.240
I don't know though.

02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:25.080
I mean, I guess a redesign of the console makes sense, although they never redesigned

02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:26.080
the original Xbox.

02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:27.880
They didn't really let it live its full life either.

02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:31.040
They kind of rushed the 360 out.

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:33.400
By the way, Major Nelson has actually commented on it.

02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:38.080
He told popular blog Xbox 360 Fanboy that, quote, I have no knowledge of an event in

02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:41.000
India and therefore anything related to one.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.280
I think we all know that if we had something to say, we'd be saying it.

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:46.640
Hmm.

02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:47.720
Very interesting.

02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:52.080
I think though, I think a redesign of the console will come in the future, but I can't

02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:56.020
imagine a version of the console where I can't use the same hard drive, or I'd be pretty

02:29:56.020 --> 02:29:57.020
pissed.

02:29:57.020 --> 02:30:00.080
I don't know about you guys, I'd be mad if I couldn't plug that same hard drive into

02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:01.080
a new console.

02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:05.240
Plus, why would I, I wouldn't even get the new console unless I had something, like let's

02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:08.680
say it had a digital camera built in, or maybe had music playback.

02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:11.800
A digital camera built in to a console?

02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:14.540
Yeah, because a console really uses the camera.

02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:16.920
By the way, that reminds me, I gotta buy- It was a DS joke.

02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:18.220
Yeah, I know it was a DS joke.

02:30:18.220 --> 02:30:19.220
I caught that.

02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:20.560
Oh my god, really?

02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:21.920
Was that something we talked about earlier?

02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:22.920
You know, it was.

02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:25.000
It was what we call like a loopback joke.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.580
I know, that's so crazy.

02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:30.400
It's like, it's like referring- Have you been paying attention for the past hour?

02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:36.080
It's like almost like foreshadowing, but in the reverse, backshadowing.

02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:38.200
Any other smartass comments before I open up the Skype line?

02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:43.080
No, I was gonna say that more people will need to buy a camera for LittleBigPlanet,

02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:47.120
I guess, when it comes out, because it uses the Playstation Eye heavily.

02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:49.840
So are you encouraging people to run out and buy Eye of Judgement so they can get the camera?

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:51.080
Fuck no, but it's a waste of money.

02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:52.880
Buy the camera, it's cheaper.

02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:53.880
Alright.

02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:56.400
1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call.

02:30:56.400 --> 02:31:01.200
We have time for a couple of calls here tonight, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:31:01.200 --> 02:31:02.200
That's all one word.

02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:03.200
You can call us right now.

02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:04.760
The Skype line is open.

02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:06.880
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:07.880
Who's this?

02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:08.880
Hey, hey, it's Rama.

02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:09.880
Hey, Rama.

02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:10.880
How you doing?

02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:11.880
Pretty good.

02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:14.840
Tired from this weekend, but other than that, I'm doing alright.

02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:19.000
So you know, I got pictures on my cell phone from you this weekend, so I know what this

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000
means.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.840
Rama went to another con, yet again- And I have a surprise, I want you to take a look

02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:25.840
at this picture.

02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:26.840
I'll post it in the chat room.

02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:27.840
Okay.

02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:28.840
You might call him a con man.

02:31:28.840 --> 02:31:30.840
No, I'm a con whore.

02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:31.840
Con whore.

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:34.840
Alright, you're the one that called you a whore.

02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:35.840
I'm looking.

02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:36.840
Right now?

02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:42.040
Okay, he's linked me to popular blog Joystiq and a picture in their art gallery of some

02:31:42.040 --> 02:31:43.960
folks dressed up as Castle Crashers.

02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:44.960
That's cute.

02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:45.960
Cute.

02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:46.960
That's very cute.

02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:49.440
I was following them for about 20 minutes and I could not get a picture and I kept getting

02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:50.440
stopped.

02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:51.440
Why?

02:31:51.440 --> 02:31:53.400
Were you dressed up as something too?

02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:58.040
I was dressed as Ranma and people were stopping for my picture half the time.

02:31:58.040 --> 02:31:59.040
Gotcha.

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:00.040
Yeah.

02:32:00.040 --> 02:32:02.480
That's a very nice, cool little outfit though.

02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:04.760
Oh, I'm looking at the gallery though at the bottom of this page.

02:32:04.760 --> 02:32:06.000
There's somebody dressed as Kirby.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:07.000
That looks cute.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:12.160
It's actually somebody tall, but the costume is designed where they can just sit down inside

02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:14.960
it and roll around, kinda sorta.

02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:16.240
That's a cute little Kirby.

02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:20.880
Okay, now while you've got me ogling these pictures of cosplay, I mean, how was the con?

02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:24.960
And of course, you know, the gaming components of it, were there lots of gaming cosplay at

02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:26.960
the con?

02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:32.240
Actually no, and when it comes to gaming, what is this gaming that you speak of?

02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:33.680
What do you mean?

02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:36.760
There was only one game at the convention.

02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:39.760
Wow, what was that?

02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:42.840
Ubisoft's Naruto 2 for Xbox 360.

02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:45.760
Of course, because that ties directly back in anime.

02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:48.960
Yeah, they had like two big screens up for demo play.

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:50.760
That was the only game that they had.

02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:53.280
That's a cool little Kingdom Hearts cosplay.

02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:54.280
Where's the game room?

02:32:54.280 --> 02:32:55.520
They're like, what's the game room?

02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:56.520
I'm like, oh damn.

02:32:56.520 --> 02:32:59.500
Sorry, I'm looking, I know this is horrible radio, but I'm looking at this Kingdom Hearts

02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:01.280
cosplay of somebody dressed up as a Heartless.

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:02.280
That's pretty awesome, actually.

02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:05.480
I've seen a few of those running around.

02:33:05.480 --> 02:33:09.580
So not a lot of gaming content at this convention, is it just because they just want to brandish

02:33:09.580 --> 02:33:13.000
themselves as strictly, you know, it is an anime festival after all, they just want to

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.960
be strictly anime and nothing else?

02:33:14.960 --> 02:33:16.720
No, there's no general rule.

02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:18.560
I guess it's just, people want it.

02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:24.020
It was just mostly, I really didn't see a lot of cosplay myself, and I was in the dealer's

02:33:24.020 --> 02:33:26.520
room in the thicket of it all.

02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:29.680
That's kind of weird though, because it looks like there was quite a bit of gaming cosplay

02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:34.560
for a con that didn't really have gaming.

02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:35.560
Go fig, you know?

02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:36.560
Oh, that's cool.

02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:40.800
There's a whole little trio there dressed up like the Whirlins with you, those characters.

02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:43.000
That's kind of neat.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Huh.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
So, good con?

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Fun time?

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:50.560
It was an improvement over last year's, but it could have been better.

02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:53.040
I walked in and I'm like, where's the con?

02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:57.000
I'm like, it's downstairs in the basement, whereas last year, and I'm thinking since

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.360
there was no digital life, it's going to be upstairs like Comic-Con was, but it wasn't.

02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:06.320
Oh, this was the convention that goes on the same time as digital life?

02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:07.320
Yes.

02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:11.400
Oh, so digital life would have happened this past weekend, had it happened.

02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:12.400
Yes.

02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:13.400
Oh, interesting.

02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:16.680
All right, well, anything else you want to say about the convention before we get some

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:17.680
more calls?

02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:20.800
The only thing that really annoyed me was that you had to pay extra for concerts and

02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:21.800
autographs.

02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:24.800
I mean, they get Ominous Autograph with $60.

02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:25.800
What?

02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:27.280
That's a little weird.

02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:29.040
I haven't heard of cons doing that before.

02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:30.440
They get away with it, though?

02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:34.840
Yeah, comic book conventions are known for doing it, but not anime conventions, but since

02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:39.920
I could not get Jamie her autograph, I got her a little gift to really cheer her up,

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:42.120
and I'm posting a picture of it in the chat room right now.

02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:43.120
Okay.

02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:47.200
I'm going to do one of her all-time favorite movies.

02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:49.600
I'm going to look right now, too.

02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:50.600
Ha!

02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:52.600
That's great.

02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:53.840
That's great.

02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:54.840
What is it?

02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:55.840
Winchester Tavern.

02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:58.320
Did you see Song of the Dead?

02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:00.800
Oh my God, okay.

02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:01.800
Wow.

02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:04.200
I bought three of those.

02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:06.040
That is kind of randomly awesome.

02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:08.040
That is so sweet.

02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:11.480
Where the hell did you find that at an anime con?

02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:14.360
It was on a dealer's table with shirts.

02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:17.160
There's actually a Song of the Dead cosplay now, so why not?

02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:21.200
Yeah, I saw that at a couple other cons I'd been to.

02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:25.840
You know they had Song of the Dead on the big screen in San Francisco not that long

02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:26.840
ago?

02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:27.840
I was watching Hot Fuzz yesterday.

02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:28.840
Nice.

02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:29.840
All right.

02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:30.840
That's so sweet.

02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:31.840
Thank you.

02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:34.960
Well, Rama, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you for

02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:36.920
bringing us to our show.

02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:37.920
No problem.

02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:38.920
See you later.

02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:39.920
Have a good one, buddy.

02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:40.920
All right.

02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:41.920
Thank you.

02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:43.720
I keep forgetting to ask him if he's coming back for Fanime in 2009.

02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:44.720
I think he said he was, right?

02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:45.720
Want to hold him to that?

02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:46.720
I hope so.

02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:47.720
I hope so too.

02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:48.720
All right.

02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:52.240
Orange Lounge Radio, our username on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR, if you want to call us the

02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:53.240
old-fashioned way.

02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:55.400
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:56.400
Who's this?

02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:03.080
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land, it is he who likes to whore a bunch of time in live

02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:04.080
shows and podcasts.

02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:07.480
I was going to say, you were just on Bobby's show like three hours ago.

02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:08.480
Yes, yes, yes, it was.

02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:09.480
No, that's all right.

02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:12.840
I was asking you to our program, especially with all the work you've done for our show,

02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:14.640
how could we not have you on the program?

02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:16.680
You have a good radio voice, now I have something good to say.

02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:19.100
So what does he want to say tonight, Jason?

02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:25.840
I was kind of offended by Loki's remarks going, I'm not just whoring time, I'm whoring time

02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:28.480
about the exact same thing all over again.

02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:33.280
I have to take some offense to what Loki was saying about favorite studios online and all

02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:34.280
that nonsense.

02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:37.200
I'm sorry, say that again?

02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:42.440
Loki's developers are lazy, fabled to, no online co-op immediately, this, that, and

02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:43.440
the other.

02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:46.420
I have to take a little bit of offense to that.

02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:48.360
Why is that?

02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:52.360
Developers are not lazy and maybe it's a bit of respect that I'm getting out of the fact

02:36:52.360 --> 02:37:00.040
that I work at a job that has a lot of developers and when things don't go right and you find

02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:04.440
out about them, it becomes a losing situation no matter what you try to do.

02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:11.000
You either cut the feature out, you push the product back, you release it in a hodgepodge

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:15.960
and everybody complains and you fix it again.

02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:19.020
It's no simple matter and developers typically aren't lazy.

02:37:19.020 --> 02:37:21.440
Lazy developers are the people who make big rigs.

02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:25.240
Besides that and New World Order, those people don't really exist in the software industry

02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:27.240
that means anything.

02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:35.920
What about the fact that this was one of the biggest things that they were pushing in this

02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:38.080
game and now it's not there anymore?

02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:42.520
That to me is kind of what makes it, what they're doing here, newsworthy.

02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:45.480
If it had been just a little feature, I bet most of us wouldn't have blinked an eye at

02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:49.080
it but this is a pretty big thing that they were selling in the game and now they've just

02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:53.120
basically said, well it's not really going to be there the first day, sorry.

02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:57.720
Yeah, and the game was really big and the engine to power it too.

02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:01.040
You have to have the game before you have the online component.

02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:07.640
And if they had detrimental lag, rendering issues or anything, I haven't even read into

02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:12.280
the details but just on a purely, I don't even know what the word is, just on a purely

02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:17.260
basic level, things don't go perfectly as planned.

02:38:17.260 --> 02:38:22.720
How long have they had this release date that they're going to make because they're going

02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:24.920
to finish without this feature?

02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:29.920
Why not push the release date two weeks back to give us all the features?

02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:35.240
Basically what it boils down to is there's no right or wrong way to do it but no matter

02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:40.600
what you do, if you don't have a perfect product and nobody does, if you don't have a perfect

02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:44.080
product, it's a no-win situation.

02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:49.200
Something as big as this is definitely worse but it's a no-win situation to the developers

02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:55.240
who try and try and try and make one of these decisions because they're trying to make things

02:38:55.240 --> 02:38:57.200
better for their consumers.

02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:00.200
But there's a lot of times, I mean, and don't get me wrong, I know developers work hard

02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:04.420
but there's a lot of times that games come out and I'm sure the people actually coding

02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:08.760
this stuff, yeah, they work hard but I'm wondering about some of those QA stuff because there's

02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:15.160
a lot of games, especially from certain companies a lot, certain publishers, that are really

02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:16.440
messed up when they come out.

02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:21.080
I mean, seriously, there's no way.

02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:25.320
I mean, and that is who I'm calling lazy.

02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:30.720
Bigger's new world order, like I said, there are definitely the examples but those people

02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:36.040
who are that blatant go away never to be heard from again and we laugh them on the way out.

02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:40.520
Well, not really because I mean look at like EA, a lot of recent sports games have had

02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:46.420
pretty bad problems in them and Mercenaries 2, I have to keep going back to this but seriously

02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:51.800
oh my God, there is no way that these glitches, they couldn't have caught this stuff because

02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:57.000
I run into them so often in this game, anybody playtesting this stuff through would have

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:00.080
run into at least a dozen of these each time.

02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:03.520
Just to say though, sometimes I got to, just in defense of people who QA games because

02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:06.960
I know we have a lot of them that actually listen to this show, sometimes they find these

02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:09.780
bugs and they report back and their superiors just don't care.

02:40:09.780 --> 02:40:12.320
It's kind of one of those things where it's like we don't have the time to fix it.

02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:13.320
Okay.

02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:18.960
Well then, either way, it looks bad on the publishing company then.

02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:26.480
Jason, any other thoughts on this?

02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:34.280
I have spent my time, I do have to echo SSJ100 Matt though, I did play NHL08, well the demo

02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:39.700
at least but I'm sure that was indicative enough of the actual game and I had pucks

02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:45.480
going through the ice and I had a lot of funny things happening, NHL09 has been pretty solid

02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:46.480
so far.

02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:48.120
I'm definitely enjoying that.

02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:53.560
I think it's the first sports game, it's a simulation that I like.

02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:56.400
Even better than Blades of Steel?

02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:58.140
Like I said, simulation.

02:40:58.140 --> 02:41:03.280
Everything else of that age was arcade style but this is actually a sim that I'm thoroughly

02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:04.280
enjoying.

02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:05.280
Fair enough, fair enough.

02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:07.640
Alright well Jason, we're going to let you go so we can try and get one more call but

02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:09.800
thanks of course for the call and the insight.

02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:10.800
We appreciate it.

02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:11.800
Good day.

02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:12.800
Alright, have a good one.

02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:13.800
Bye.

02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:17.560
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio,

02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:21.100
if you'd like to give us a call, we'll probably take like one more call and then call it a

02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:25.520
night here at Orange Lounge Radio and get to wrapping up the show.

02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:28.320
Real quick though, while we wait for the call, do we have any last minute stories?

02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:32.960
This isn't really a story but it was a video that appeared on YouTube but it's now gone

02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:33.960
on YouTube.

02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:39.920
GameStop, some of them store their consoles in their bathroom so I hope you like pee on

02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:41.640
your console.

02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:43.520
Ew.

02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:50.040
Well I heard this also from that, was it that Zero, I don't remember, the guy that was mimicking

02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:54.640
Zero Punctuation but bashing GameStop, he said the same thing about consoles in the

02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:59.920
bathroom and now they have a video of it and it got taken down off of YouTube apparently.

02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:06.000
First of all, and I can say this from my experience of being in a number of GameStops in the area,

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.480
sometimes they're given such little storage space they actually have no choice but to

02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:19.920
put things in the bathroom but if anyone is urinating or defecating on the console, I

02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:28.080
would definitely think there'd be a way to tell by the box it's contained in so...

02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:30.320
What smells in here?

02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:32.720
Must be something the Sony's putting with the PlayStation.

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:36.920
I think there's absolutely no problem with them keeping a console in the bathroom.

02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:41.400
As long as, you know, it's kept away from the toilet and sink it's fine.

02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:44.200
They need the storage space, they need the storage space.

02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:48.840
I just don't understand why a GameStop is a company that can't just, I don't know, spend

02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:53.120
some of that 7.5 billion dollars that you're making or whatever and maybe...

02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:55.640
Two words, bottom line.

02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:01.720
As long as no one's dipping their balls on them, that's the most important thing.

02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:03.760
Next time I go buy a console and I'm going to wonder...

02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:04.760
It's a feature, what?

02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:07.680
Alright, Luke, we've got somebody on hold on the line, I want to get to them.

02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:10.080
Hi, Aaron, Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:11.960
Hey there, Orange Launch Radio, this is Dekeman.

02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:13.800
Hey, Dekeman, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:17.280
Oh, not a lot, I just wanted to pimp a game that I don't think I've really heard anybody

02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:18.960
talking about the last couple of weeks.

02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:19.960
Oh, please, by all means.

02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:20.960
Uh, DeBlob, for Wii.

02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:25.280
I don't know if you guys have seen this game, but it's awesome.

02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:28.320
I've been playing it pretty much all day and it's frickin' fantastic.

02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:31.920
I know, I saw it at PAX, I watched Loki play it at PAX, actually.

02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:34.200
You remember the blob game where you were painting the walls different colors?

02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:35.200
Yeah, it was alright.

02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:36.200
Yeah?

02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:37.200
What's makes it...

02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:38.200
I've just been loving it.

02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:39.200
It feels like playing Katamari Damacy.

02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:43.760
I don't know, it just gives me that same feeling of just, you know, just a fun time.

02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:46.760
Awesome, so that's kind of what makes this game to you?

02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:49.520
Because keep in mind, we only saw like a few minutes of it at an expo.

02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:54.000
We can't really form a full opinion on the game based on that, so is it just the fun

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
factor?

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Yeah.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000
What kind of stuff do you do in this game?

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.000
What makes it so fun?

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:02.200
Basically, you just play as like a gelatinous blob that can take on different colors, and

02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:05.760
then you roll around the city, and every time you touch a building or an object, it just

02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:07.400
explodes with color.

02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:10.520
And you start off in a completely black and white, desolate world, and then you start

02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:13.560
touching buildings and the whole city just comes to life.

02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:18.120
It's really quite impressive, especially for a third-party Wii title.

02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:20.600
That was that one that we saw at PAX, right?

02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:22.720
Yeah, I don't remember if you were there.

02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:24.160
I think you were elsewhere on the ship.

02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:25.160
I was there.

02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:26.160
Did you?

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:27.160
Because I grabbed the little comic book that came out with it.

02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:28.160
Oh.

02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:29.160
I thought we were there several times.

02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:30.160
That was lots of fun.

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:31.160
I really enjoyed it in that one.

02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:32.160
Oh, it is.

02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:33.160
It's fantastic.

02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:34.160
Hmm.

02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:36.760
So you literally get to paint the town red, as Frisbee says in chat.

02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:39.200
Yeah, pretty much.

02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:40.200
It's great.

02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:41.200
Seriously, check it out if you get the chance.

02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:42.200
Nice.

02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:43.200
Okay.

02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:44.200
Well, we might have to check that out.

02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:45.200
Is it only on Wii?

02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:46.200
Or did they put it on other systems?

02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:49.440
No, it's only on Wii, but like I said, it is easily the best third-party Wii title I've

02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:50.440
ever seen.

02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:51.440
Huh.

02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:52.440
Very cool.

02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:53.440
Yeah.

02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:54.440
What did you play with us?

02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:56.440
Uh, Samba de Amigo for the Wii.

02:44:56.440 --> 02:44:57.440
Ah.

02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:00.360
How did that turn out?

02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:01.360
What's that?

02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:02.360
How did that game turn out?

02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:04.440
Because I'd be curious to pick it up, but there's just so much other stuff I'm playing

02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:05.440
right now.

02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:06.440
I haven't had a chance.

02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:07.920
The controls are kind of here and there.

02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:11.120
They could really touch you, but I think that once you play with it for a couple of hours,

02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:14.840
you really get the idea of how to control the game, but that's really the only problem

02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:15.840
I've had with it.

02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:20.360
The track list is fantastic, so yeah, I'm enjoying it.

02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:21.360
Very cool.

02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:22.360
Huh.

02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:23.360
All right.

02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:24.360
Well.

02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:25.360
Okay.

02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:26.360
Well.

02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:29.800
Oh, have you had fun posing in Samba de Amigo?

02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:30.800
That's the most important part.

02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:31.800
Oh, yeah.

02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:33.800
In the hustle mode?

02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:34.800
Fantastic.

02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:36.000
They really beefed it up.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.240
I'll play that mode more than the regular mode.

02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:39.240
Awesome.

02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:40.240
All right.

02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:41.240
Well, thanks so much for the call, Dekeman.

02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:42.240
We've got to go and wrap up the show.

02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:43.240
Yep.

02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:44.240
No worries.

02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:45.240
Take care, guys.

02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:46.240
Have a good one.

02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:47.240
You too.

02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:48.240
Bye.

02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:49.240
I don't remember Dekeman calling in before.

02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:52.140
Maybe once a long time ago, but I know he's been in the chat room a lot for our program,

02:45:52.140 --> 02:45:53.560
so that's good to hear from him.

02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:54.560
All right.

02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:55.560
We're going to shut the Skype line down.

02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:56.560
Sorry, folks.

02:45:56.560 --> 02:45:58.440
We're going to start to wrap up the show here, but I want to make sure we got all our last

02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:03.120
minute stories out of the way.

02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:04.120
That's all I have.

02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:05.120
Huh?

02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:06.120
Dark Sakura?

02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:08.720
My last minute story is I like pie.

02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:10.320
That's not a story.

02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:11.320
Wait.

02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:12.320
I do have one more.

02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:17.000
Remember I talked about last week the Wii ISO loader that got leaked out, and then the

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:23.440
guy making it when it, oh, looks like a wheny cocoa or something like that, wheny cocoa.

02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:29.320
You know, basically he was pissed off about the leak or something like that, and so he's

02:46:29.320 --> 02:46:34.880
like, well, you know, I'm not going to work on it anymore, and then later on the week,

02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:36.920
well, maybe I'll work on some more.

02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:38.920
Well, I missed the attention, so.

02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:43.160
Yeah, maybe I'll finish it now, so.

02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:46.120
So yeah, ISO loader may be coming at some point.

02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:51.280
Okay, well, if there's no other last minute stories, then we're going to go ahead and

02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:54.840
go around and get everybody's final thought and try to wrap up tonight's show.

02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:55.840
We'll start off with Tiara.

02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:57.400
Thanks so much for joining us here tonight.

02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:02.080
I hope you had fun, and do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:03.080
No.

02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:04.080
No.

02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:06.080
Just a simple no.

02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:08.720
We'll have a safe flight back to Las Vegas and come see us again.

02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:09.720
I definitely will.

02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:10.720
Thank you.

02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:11.720
Awesome.

02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:12.720
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:17.600
My final thought is I went this weekend and played Airsoft, and it was fun, so my gun

02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:22.720
I have, the P90 or whatever, I have these 300 round clips, and I hated having to run

02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:29.360
out of ammo and change clips and stuff, it's just so inconvenient, so I bought a 1500 round

02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:31.320
box magazine for it now.

02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:33.200
I will never run out of ammo.

02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:34.200
Ever.

02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:35.200
Goody goody.

02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:37.400
Just don't bring that to the studio.

02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:39.960
I will bring it to the studio one of these days.

02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:40.960
No.

02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:45.080
I'm just gonna get shot, especially if another dance hero, which I'm surprised, did not come

02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:49.740
up on Skype tonight, the dance hero thing, maybe next week, maybe we'll get some emails.

02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:55.280
My final thought would be I had a bite of John's Chinese food and it was really good.

02:47:55.280 --> 02:48:01.160
It was really good, because I haven't had deep fried chicken in a long time.

02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:04.720
And a nice little humanized Mega Man picture there that Dark Soccer is showing me.

02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:06.480
This is gonna be my final thought when...

02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:07.480
Oh, what?

02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:08.920
Okay, then what is your final thought?

02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:11.880
Someone needs to go look at Masao's artwork.

02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:24.560
It's at www.5c.biglobe.ne.jp slash tilde kure kure kure kure slash index.htm.

02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:25.800
You are gonna post that in chat, right?

02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:26.800
I am.

02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:27.800
That's a long ass link.

02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:33.280
It's basically this guy that does weird video game art and kind of scary Ronald McDonald

02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:37.760
art, but he does Mario and Luigi.

02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:39.720
I'm interested in the scary Ronald McDonald art.

02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:40.720
Me too, I might have to look at this.

02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:42.720
But the artist is Masao, M-A-S-A-O.

02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:43.720
Alright.

02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:45.720
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:48.520
Well if you didn't have a pen and paper to write down that link fast enough, and sadly

02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:51.640
you weren't in chat tonight, you should come join us for a live show sometime.

02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:56.120

Just so many ways for you guys to have a voice here on Orange Launch Radio.

We got some more great reviews on iTunes this week and that's very nice and every little

02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:33.680
bit helps and makes us rank to that much better on iTunes and helps the visibility of the

02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:34.680

02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:36.800

02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:39.480
You're great!

02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:41.640
Alright, that's going to wrap it up.
