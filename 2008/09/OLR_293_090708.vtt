Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, September 7th, 2008, we take some time to decompress after Penny Arcade Expo,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Luminous makes its way to yet another platform,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
and could a new Kingdom Hearts game be showing at Tokyo Game Show?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
We weren't here last week because, you know, we were at Penny Arcade Expo, that would be myself, Rob Roberts,

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
and the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Hi!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
But we are back this week, are we not?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yes we are.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
So to do another podcast for you lovely people out there.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
The tape's live on Sunday nights over AllGames.com.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
But not joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
We're joined instead by your laundry.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Yes, my laundry is instead sitting in the chair that Loki usually does, because, you know, we tape at my house.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
But, very interesting, the wife was so mad that he went to Penny Arcade Expo, she killed him.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
So he's not here tonight, nor will he ever be back.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
She's replaced him with Rob's laundry.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Yes. No, just kidding of course.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
He's away at a thing for his day job today that he had to go to, so he won't be here tonight.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
But he'll be back next week, as we all will.

01:31.000 --> 01:42.000
And we have no guests tonight either, it's just the lovely DarkSakura, myself, feeling the love with all you kids from our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And we have some stuff there in chat.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Gsquared68 says, Orange Laundry Mower Radio.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I tried to get Dan to come tonight.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
What was his excuse?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
He had to work.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Aw, bummer.

01:53.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah, weren't you telling me that Dan, you know, gosh, he's so, so just worked and worn out, he was playing Street Fighter IV this week or something?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
It was at the Game Crazy Manager Conference.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
They either had it there or he went to an arcade that had one, but he played Street Fighter IV and said that it was pretty good but the jumping was weird.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Hmm.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
He looks very slick from what I've seen. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on it.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
He said he played like any Street Fighter.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Nice.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Very excited.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Of course, that's not the one I'm excited about.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
What are you excited about?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Freaking Capcom vs. Tatsunoko.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I had a feeling.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Any particular reason?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Gotcha, mon!

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Well, yeah.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Gotcha, mon.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
And Dan's like, it doesn't, it doesn't have Joe in it.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
I was like, but it has Ken and it has Hurricane Polymer and Kashawn, so it's all cool.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Alright, very nice.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
And Tekamon.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
Gsquared68 is also mentioning in our chatroom, San Jose State has it, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump from us, so maybe we have to take a road trip at some point.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
That would be cool.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
That would be fun.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
A little OLR road trip as if Seattle wasn't fun enough.

02:52.000 --> 03:03.000
Speaking of Seattle, Penny Arcade Expo, you know, unfortunately we did not get to do our own show just due to some technical difficulties, but we contributed to...

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Shut up.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
No, no, no, no, no.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Due to, I'm going to come clean on this one.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Alright.

03:09.000 --> 03:21.000
When we were going to be doing a show, Jamie instead passed out, while I managed to pass out over a conversation, so that meant that we had no show Saturday night.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah, technical difficulties.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
We'll just leave it at that.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Host difficulties.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Doesn't technical difficulties sound better than host malfunction?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I had technical difficulties with my ability to stay awake.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Jamie has a walking technical difficulty, actually.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
You know what, Rob?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
But, no, we had a lot of fun at PAX.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
It was OLR bonding.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
It was fantastic.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
And some Bobby bonding as well.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
And some hatred of the western internet.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Yes, the western internet was sucky.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And some bonding with our listeners.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
We had some great, we had just a wonderful turnout from the All Games Network.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Such an experience with that super glue and duct tape, I swear.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
The Penny Arcade Expo you never hope to experience.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
But, no, we all went out for a real nice dinner one night with ourselves.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
Some of the other All Games hosts were there, like Loserleaf and Deadpix Alive went with us and some of the other folks like Rob Dee who did this day in gaming, I think it was called.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
And it's been too long.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
And just a bunch of listeners came with us out to dinner one night.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It was fantastic.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
We had a great time.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
We had really good food on top of it.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah, absolutely.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
So, good times.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Black Wolf is clarifying in chat there was no bondage.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
I don't know where that came from.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I think some of our chatters are going there.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I just said bonding.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Literally, you know.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Bonding.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
It was that episode.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
No, I'm just kidding.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Anyhow.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Alright, so how was your Penny Arcade Expo Dark Soccer?

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
I know we usually start with how was your gaming week, but seeing as Penny Arcade Expo was such a...

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
We'll get to gaming week post packs later.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
How was your Penny Arcade Expo?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
What kind of stuff did you see at the show that you enjoyed?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Walk us through your time at Penny Arcade Expo a little bit.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
Well, I was in a daze, you know, that Friday because I was just all like pretty shiny.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Namco.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Hang out with Namco for an hour.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
You know, and they were just selling stuff, but I was like, dude, I don't care because it's Namco.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
And I went in a Dig Dug plushie and couldn't get one.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Did you miss the memo that Namco hates us?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Katamari?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Remember that?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Ah, forget it.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
So?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm kidding.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I love Namco.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I worked for them, sort of, at the arcade.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
But at any rate, actually, you know, we did the rounds of the room when it was press only

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
and that was pretty cool.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
I liked that it was very relaxed, at least for those few hours.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
I saw things that I liked.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
I didn't play too much just because I was mostly observing and I could get a feel for

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
it just by watching people.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
I played a few things myself.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I really, really like Little Big Planet.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I thought that was pretty cool.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I liked what I saw of Spore.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
We're probably going to get it eventually.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't really have much time to play it, so it's whenever Dan gets it.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
I actually liked Wii Music because I thought that it was just neat.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
I thought that, you know, and I like, I'm one of those people who likes finding, you

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
know, MIDI programs and then redoing all the instruments in the MIDI to sound completely

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
bizarre.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
So, actually, one of the things that I liked about Wii Music is that it just had that playing

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
with MIDI tones type of thing to it.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
Animal Crossing, it was Animal Crossing.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I really liked the Wario game.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
That one was kind of cool.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
I went over to hang out with, okay, was it EA?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
No, it wasn't EA.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
EA had some of the crap.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Just so you know, Bobby just disowned you because you like Wii Music.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I didn't say that I was going to play it.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
I just thought it was neat.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
You know, this comes from my old, you know, old, what was my third major?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Music major, right?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
So, I think I'm on major number 12 now.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I would be all over Wii Music if I was 12.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah, I thought it was neat.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
I thought it was, it would be something that would be fun to waste some time with, I thought.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
At any rate.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I gotta say this.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Black Wolf just said, I liked and Wii Music do not belong in the same sentence unless

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
in the context of I liked to hate on Wii Music.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
You know, I think we said this in an earlier show when we first talked about Wii Music.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
If it gets kids into real music, it's a good thing, regardless.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
See, that's what I think.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
It's a great platform, you know, into learning a bit more.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I mean, because really it teaches tempo.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
It teaches a little bit of arrangement.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I thought, you know, I thought it's a neat little concept.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
You know, I would have totally loved to have something like this when I was little.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
I played Mario Paint, you know, but at any rate, moving forward.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
I also liked talking with the guy that they interviewed for Guitar Hero.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
He was pretty cool, and I'm really, really looking forward to the studio mode.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I mean, really looking forward to the studio mode, and I was reminded of that by thinking

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
of Mario Paint.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
You know, people making their own music and everything.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I think it would be fantastic.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I'm really, really looking forward to that.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
I played the game that I always forget the name of that you play as a sushi plate.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I'm going to get the name of it off of my phone again just because I took a picture

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
because I could not remember the name of it because it was so bizarre.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Sushi Bumper Sumo Fun Game.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
And as I was saying earlier when Bobby called in, you play as a sushi plate,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
and you have to keep the other piece of sushi away from the others,

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
and they can knock you into the conveyor belt, and you lose a piece of sushi.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
And whoever holds onto the sushi for the longest time within two minutes

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
gets a higher score and wins.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
That's basically keep away with sushi.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
And it was a really fun, weird little game, and from what I understand,

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
it's supposed to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, so I'm looking forward to that.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
I really, really wish I had ear plugs for all the people who couldn't sing

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
that were playing rock band and guitar hero because, I mean,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
you've got a bar telling you when you're out of tune

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
you should actually pay attention to it.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm sorry.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
I don't know if I've said so before on the show, but I hear Perfect Pitch,

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
which drove me nuts in band, but I really can't filter out.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
That's why I don't like to sing in front of people because I can hear it in myself.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
That's why I don't sing.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
At any rate, other stuff that I saw that was really cool was Pink Godzilla

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
because I bought stuff from Pink Godzilla.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
For anyone who doesn't know, my anniversary was on the 1st.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Dan and I have been married for three years,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
and I bought him his anniversary present from Pink Godzilla.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
I got him a salamander pack for a PSP.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
That's nerd love right there.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
That is nerd love.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Well, he got me an iPod that he got for free.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
He regifted? He regifted for your anniversary?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
That's fine. I don't care.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
At least it's an iPod.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
It's a little in red, and it says the GameStop special edition or some shit on it.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
But anyway, other fun stuff.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I liked hanging out with the Commando 3 people.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
They were kind of cool.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Actually, they were really cool.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
I actually went to talk to some of the digital design students.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
You can't do this in Wii music, but you can do it in Mario Paint.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
That's actually a pretty decent little arrangement.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Where's my bucket so I can roll it at you?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Sorry. Couldn't resist.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Anyway.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Wii music will never have the greatness of the Mario Paint.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Mario Paint was fantastic.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
We need Mario Paint, the sequel.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
Mario Paint 2, Electric Boogaloo.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Other stuff that I saw slash played or did.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
I was mentioning, I was talking to a lot of the digital design schools that try to get people to sign up for their schools.

11:07.000 --> 11:15.000
They really actually got a lot of good tips for myself as far as things to study in my current major.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
They were all like, we'd prefer you to go to our school.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
But there's a few of them that were actually beginning transfer programs.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
That's kind of looking into. There's one in Sunnyvale.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
And that would just be really cool because then I'd be close to Capcom's testing grounds and that would be sweet.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Also, trying out all the fun restaurants.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
Going to Gameworks, which was oddly disappointing because I couldn't win that Tales out of the Crane game.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
And there was an incredible, incredible lack of Planet Harriers.

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
So I wanted to cry in sub-tears of disappointment for having no Planet Harrier.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
Because Planet Harrier is one of the greatest arcade games ever. Ever.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
What? Rob's looking like he's up to something, everybody.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
No, they just wanted to link to the YouTube and chat.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
So I just put it in there in true Mario Paint Roll fashion.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I put, dude, this YouTube is so cool and then put the link.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
So we'll see how many people click it.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
Well, I also played, actually I was very surprised about how much I liked it.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I played the Ninja Gaiden demo on DS.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
And it was really, really cool, but there was another DS demo that actually was really freaking fun.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
And that was the Arkanoid demo.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
I used to play Arkanoid back in the day on the old, you know, Gamebrick.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
The old Gameboy. And that was pretty fun.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
I saw people playing WonderSwan and I wished I had brought my WonderSwan.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh, I wish I had brought mine too.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Oh, I would have had a WonderSwan party.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
That would have been great.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
It would have been wonderful.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
I saw a couple Neo Geo Pocket colors and I, you know, I had actually come this close.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
And for anyone not looking, it's about a millimeter, my fingers are apart, from bringing my Turbo Express.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
Because actually I saw someone playing a Duo LT.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
For anyone who doesn't know, the Duo LT is freaking expensive!

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Expensive!

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
That's something awesome to bring to the handheld lounge at Penny Arcade Expo.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Because usually it's, you know, DSes, a few PSPs.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
But to bring like a freaking, you know, portable Neo Geo would be awesome.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Well, the Duo LT, and I'll find a Wikipedia page to link to everybody.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Basically it's the Turbo Graphics Duo laptop.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Which had its own little screen and everything.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Really freaking expensive.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And I saw someone who had one.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
And then I got to meet my musical hero, Jonathan Coulton.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
And I got to meet my geek hero, Wil Wheaton.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Good times.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And I had a fan-gasm both times.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
So you had a great PAX, it sounds like.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Hell yeah!

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
How did it compare to the E3 of old that we used to go to?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Because a lot of people were saying, PAX is the new E3!

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
No, PAX is not the new E3.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
Imagine, and it's like I kept wanting to call it a con.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Because it felt like going to a freaking convention.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
I mean, like, the show floor or whatever was like half dealer's room anyway.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
And it was just really fun.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
There were the free game panels, there were movies, there were performances.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
This wasn't like E3, this was a freaking convention.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
That's what this was.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
This wasn't...

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
E3 is a media, you know, spectacle, I should say.

14:26.000 --> 14:35.000
PAX is, it's like an anime con, but just video games.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
I would like to say to all of you folks that went to Penny Arcade Expo,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I'm quite proud of the majority of you for knowing how to bathe properly.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I know!

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It was actually a pretty pleasant smelling.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
I mean, don't get me wrong, there were a few people that smelled like fart.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
But some people, the most people...

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
It's the gym sock syndrome.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You can tell who's been sleeping in the lounge.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Most people were very well bathed, and I appreciate it.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
And all the All Games people were well, well bathed.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
So thank you all.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I really, I just really had a good time.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
You know what, it felt a lot...

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Except for DMN.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Dirty bastard.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
It felt a lot like going to Fauna Mae.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Is that the impression that you got?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Kinda.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
It was really laid back.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
But it was All Games, so I felt like I understood it.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I felt like it was...

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
It was the most of Fauna Mae.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And on top of that, I thought that it was very well organized

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
as far as getting into some of the events,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
though I didn't go to the one event I wanted to go to.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Well, that and the Nerdcore Rising.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I got to see MC Frontalot, but I didn't mind anything from him.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Oh well.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Anyway, but it was just really, I thought, well organized

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
and how they had everything together.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
And it gave everybody a fair opportunity.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
So that was even what impressed me a whole lot more.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
That and there was some cosplay.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Oh my God.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
It was very convention-like.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Except there was some really shitty cosplay.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And whoever that was who cosplayed the bride

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
who wasn't wearing underwear, you need to eat a steak, girl.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
I'm sorry.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
I could see...

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
When you can see someone's pelvic bones, their hips,

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
no, that's the sign that somebody needs to freaking sit down

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
with a porterhouse and chow down.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Sorry.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
And nobody wants to see your ass.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Thank you.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
All right.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
I'll try to keep my pack stuff short.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I mean, Jamie hit on most of it.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I had a lot of fun broadcasting with the All Games crew.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
You know, the seven or eight hours we were doing it.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
And just getting to meet people and hang out with people.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
You know, the show four kind of came and went.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Thank God we got to go in there a little bit early

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
and kind of take everything in and actually get to play things.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
To kind of echo some of the games,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Dark Sakura talked about Wii music.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I'm still not as huge of a fan of.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
But again, if I look at it from the angle of a seven-year-old

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
might play this game and decide they want to play real drums,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm okay with it.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
But me, I'm not going to buy it.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
Animal Crossing has the potential to be neat or really, really stale.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And right now it's feeling a little stale.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
So I just really hope the internet functionality is built in there

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
the way we're all dreaming of

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
because that's going to be what saves this game.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
The Wario Land game was great too.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
But, you know, obviously that's something we've kind of already seen here in studio

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
if you've been paying attention on the last few episodes.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
As far as other stuff that Jamie didn't talk about

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
because I don't think it's quite up her alley,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Warhammer Online I got to check out a little bit.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
We had a booth set up there.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
And, you know, the folks behind Warhammer Online

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
are very adamant that we're not WoW, we're not WoW, we're not trying to be WoW.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
WoW is, you know, the Beatles and we're Led Zeppelin and all this stuff,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
which is cool.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
But the demo that they had there was leveling up the first few levels

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
like starting a new character.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
And I felt that when you were starting a new character

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
it kind of played like WoW to me, which isn't a bad thing.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
WoW is a great formula.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
And, you know, it has slightly nicer graphics

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
and it, you know, kind of tracks your quests a little differently.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
And, of course, naturally you have different classes, different races.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
So it's not the exact same as WoW.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
But I just would have liked to have seen a little more on the floor.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I understand they showed some of this in panels,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
but, you know, those were impossible to get into without waiting forever.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
I would like to see a little more how the Realm vs. Realm combat works

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
because I feel like I only kind of partially understand it from what I heard.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
So I'm looking forward to seeing more of that.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And I realized, yeah, I could go online, look at more of that stuff.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
But I was just kind of hoping to see that on the show floor,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
especially when they're trying to really differentiate themselves.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
But I had fun with the game. That's what's important, right?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I'll probably pick it up.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
LittleBigPlanet. Loved it. Loved it. Game of the show for me, honestly.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
I was very surprised at just really how good Sony's booth was,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
all things considered.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
I actually thought the games Sony was showing

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
was probably better than the stuff Nintendo was showing on a whole.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Although, I don't know, the Wario Land game was pretty awesome, too.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
But I just really liked LittleBigPlanet

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
and I never realized the party game potential that this game has.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
And the editor looks great. I'm definitely interested in this game.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
As well, some of the other things Sony was showing, not bad.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
You know, MotorStorm 2 looked pretty interesting

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
and they were showing off the new SingStar and Buzz throughout the day.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
SingStar looked fun. I didn't get a chance to play it, though.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
You know, I was kind of impressed by Sony.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
They're really starting to redeem themselves a little bit, I think.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
Also, other games I played, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
kind of surprised me being on the show floor.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
And Dark Soccer and I actually did play a round of that.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I played Katana. She played Catwoman.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Oh, yeah, that's right. We did play that. It was fun!

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
It was kind of fun.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
You know, I said this when I was trying to summarize the show in my Live Journal.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
It's never going to be as great as Marvel vs. Capcom.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
You know, and Mortal Kombat has always been a little bit of a,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
I don't know, not so serious, at least to me,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
especially in any Mortal Kombat game since 2.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
It just played so much like the others.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Well, it's not like a real hardcore fighting game.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
It's more of a game that seems to not take itself so seriously,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
at least in my mind. You know what I mean?

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
And I think the trend continues here with DC Universe.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
You really are just kind of taking out Mortal Kombat characters

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
and putting in DC Universe characters instead, but it's the same engine.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
I don't think it's a game anyone's going to remember years from now

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
that they have such praise on, but was it a lot of big dumb fun?

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah! I think it's going to be a fun game that a lot of college dorm kids are going to eat up.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Catwoman's attack was totally like the blood rain attack except she used her claws.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah. Very cool.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Oh! One thing I forgot, if you don't mind.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Sure, go ahead.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
I played D&D 4th edition like a big freaking nerd.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
You are a big nerd.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
It was great.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
And then let's see, there's another game at PAX.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Puzzle Quest Galactrix, I'll say really quickly I got to play a little bit of.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
They had that playable on the show floor.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
And you just have to really think it's not like Bejeweled anymore.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
I mean, it is, but now it's on a hexagon, which completely changes the way you have to think about the game.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
But I enjoy myself with that game.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I just hope it's not too...

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
I mean, well, I'm kind of thinking, you know, I hope it's not too much of the same,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
but they really did try to mix it up with, you know, putting it on the hexagon

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
and kind of giving it the space theme.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I think it'll be kind of cool.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
I was very disappointed though that they were showing a trailer for Star Trek Online on the floor,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
but not any actual gameplay.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
That didn't make me disappointed.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That made my heart hurt because I'm totally going to play that.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Yeah, me too.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I was hoping to see a little more on that.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
But I understand.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
It's early.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
It's early.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
I'm not hating.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
It's just, you know, it got my hopes up only to be crushed by disappointment.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
And one more game I'll mention, the Iron Chef game I played.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I avoided it.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
It's not as horrible as you'd think.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I hear it's only a $20 game, which might not be bad.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Iron Chef America is crap.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It is, but it plays like Cooking Mama.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
But actually responsive.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Because Cooking Mama on the Wii was pretty atrocious.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
But Iron Chef felt okay.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I don't think it's going to have any real long-term playability.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
But if it's only $20, that's how much a lot of arcade titles are.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I think it'll be a lot of big, dumb fun.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I did like how you could garnish your plate.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
That was kind of fun.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I like that.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Well, I guess part of it is presentation.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah, it is cool.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I'm looking at comments from chat.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
The Rob D. says, Iron Mama, in a way.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Let's see.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I'm looking at other comments from chat here.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com, if you want to add some things to the chat.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I can't say this name.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
K-H-A-S-N, Kossen.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I don't know if that's how you say it.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
The game looks bad.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
The graphics aren't stellar, but it is on the Wii, which, you know,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
doesn't really do the high-def stuff so well.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
A game is only...

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Games...

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Play it first.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
A game with crappy graphics can still be fun.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Look at the old Atari 2600 games.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Unless it's E.T.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
Again, it's not going to be anything you're going to remember for a lifetime,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
but for 20 bucks, it's a good waste of time.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I guess that's all I really want to say about PAX.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
How was your gaming week?

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
I'll talk some more about the whole PAX broadcast and all that

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
in just a little bit when we get to housekeeping.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
I do want to say, though, how was your gaming week after PAX?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Did you play anything post-Pax that you want to talk about?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh, Ragnarok.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
And I played a stellar game of Black Knight 2000 pinball.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
For the record, we are selling our Black Knight 2000 pinball.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Oh, are you disappointed about that, or is it time?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
We want a little bit better playfield.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Oh, okay.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
We're also selling our Star Trek The Next Generation pinball.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Because, again, we want a better table.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Alright, well, as long as you get it back, because I love Next Generation.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
And any listener who is willing to trade across the board,

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
we will trade our Creature from the Black Lagoon for a Lord of the Rings pinball, please.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
I'm making a mention on behalf of my husband,

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
because I really don't care for Creature from the Black Lagoon, anyway.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
But, no, I did play a lot of...

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
I actually did play a lot of Solitaire, just because I have that kind of time,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
which is not really...

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
So, that's about it.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
I'm in school, so it's not like I have time to really do a lot of playing.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
That's cool.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
I played a lot of Rock Band and Guitar Hero this week.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
I went back to kind of milk the last little bit out of those games that I'm going to

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
before the new sequels come out,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
because we're only a few days away from Guitar Hero World Tour

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
and Rock Band 2 coming out,

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
so I'm just kind of squeezing the last little bit out of those games,

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
because, yeah, I plan to export the Rock Band tracks and then get rid of the game.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
I mean, even if I only get a few bucks for it, I'll take it,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
because I don't really plan to play it much longer.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
But I'll tell you what bugs me about Rock Band.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
You freaking people that play online matches,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
like in score battle or what have you,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
and then when I'm beating you,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
and I'm about to win the song with like 20,000 points over you,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
you freaking quit, so I don't get credit for the song.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I hate that.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
I have been leaving negative feedback, though, on people to do that,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
because that pisses me off, and I encourage people to do that.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Don't forget, like, if people quit early,

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
because they can't suck it up that someone beat them at the game,

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
freaking leave them a negative review so it does affect their little score,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
because I think that is such bullcrap.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
And Rock Band should automatically register that as a loss,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
but for whatever reason they didn't think to do that,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
and it doesn't, so it just kind of ticked me off.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And Black Wolf is correcting me in chat saying,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
World Tour doesn't come out until October 26th.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah, I'm thinking of Rock Band, though.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Rock Band is just a few more days.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I did actually have another edition of my gaming week.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I received a game.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
My wonderful husband has finally brought me home.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
The world ends with you, so I'm going to be playing that.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Oh, cool.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Finally!

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
When you beat that, I want to borrow it.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
I'm going to go and check that out.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
You will be first in line.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Ssj100matt in chat, chat.orangessauceredo.com,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
says, I leave negative feedback all the time.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
You know, and I'm also a believer in positive feedback, too.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
You know, if you actually chat with somebody and they're not going,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
you know, cock, cock, fag, fag, you know,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
all that stuff that people do on Xbox Live,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I think if, you know, there's decent people,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
you should leave positive feedback so you play with them again.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
I've done that, too.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I think not enough people are using that system,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
and it's our way to kind of filter out the a-holes,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
so you definitely should make use of that.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Don't forget that that feature's there to you,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
and if you don't know how to use it,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
just hit your little guide button after you play a match with someone,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
and go to the option that's not your friends list or your messages,

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
but it's all the way on the right side.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
It'll show you, like, the last 100 people you've played a game with,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
and so you can just click on the Personally Feedback right there.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
It's awesome.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
There you go.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
This person sucks ass.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah, sadly, you can't filter down that good,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
but you can leave the reason why you're putting them on your frown list.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
There's a smile list and a frown list,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
and if you want to mark their frown because they quit early,

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
you can do that,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
and so I've done that for you rock band fools.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I'm going to start reading names on the show

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
of gamertags that have quit out on me.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Do it.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
I'm going to.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
In fact, I'll look up the name while you're reading the next story

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
and call them out here on the program.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
That'll be fun.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
I do want to say, though,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
as far as other games I've been playing this week,

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
you know, besides usual World of Warcraft,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I did pick up Spore.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I have the box sitting right here.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
I'm excited, but I'm hoping the hype hasn't killed this game

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
because I'm hearing a lot of people are thinking this was not worth the wait,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
but I don't know.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
We'll see.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
We'll see.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I'm going to hold off on my opinion until I get a chance to play it myself.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
I do have the box sitting right here.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I'm going to install that after the show tonight.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
I just didn't have time to get around to it today.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Go ahead.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
What?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Xbox Live Arcade.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I checked out Gin Rummy.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
The presentation of that game is actually really nice.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
I just wish there was more to it than just Gin Rummy

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
because I think there's, you know,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Sierra, our masters, doing card games on the computer and such,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
so it's kind of nice to see them getting into it on Xbox Live Arcade.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I just wish there had been a little more to it,

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
and I just didn't feel like the price justified it

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
because I know this sounds harsh, but I could get a real deck of cards.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Then again, I could say the same thing about Uno,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
but yet Uno is so much fun on Xbox Live.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I can't explain what it is, the difference.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
Maybe, I don't know, maybe it's the fact more people are on Uno

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
or that Uno is so disgustingly simple

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
and you can literally just sit down and play for five minutes

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
and Rummy takes a little more time.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
I don't know.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
How about Rock Band Stuff?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
How about Rock Band Stuff?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
There is actually a Rock Band two-track list

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
that is ranked by difficulty for Xbox 360.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Hold on, hold on, we're not in Stories yet. Hold on, sorry.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you already did yours.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
No, no, no, no.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I don't know why I'm...

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
I've got to get to housekeeping.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
You know, I thought that you had read your story

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
and I completely blanked, so I'm sorry.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
No, because we're starting with a Rock Band story tonight.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
That's okay.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Because I thought that you...

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
That's all right. I'm done with my gaming week.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Let's do housekeeping and then we can talk about Rock Band, okay?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Can I go call under the couch now?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
No, you're fine, you're fine.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Housekeeping tonight.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
I wanted to mention of Penny Arcade coverage,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
the seven hours, eight hours worth of stuff

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
we did at Penny Arcade Expo is up.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
It was really Bobby that did it all,

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
because he was there the whole time.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
But we...

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
At least I pretty much was there all day Friday

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
and all day Saturday.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Dark Soccer and Loki spent pretty much

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
all their time there too.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
So check that out.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Pax.allgames.com is there

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
and that's where you can actually get now

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
some video is being posted as well

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
of the interviews that Bobby did.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
He actually has some interviews

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
and I think I showed up in the first one.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I asked a question of the Jumpgate Evolution guy.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
So it's there and you can download it

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
and it's neat.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Bobby did a very good job with the videos.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
I was very happy.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
E for All is the next expo on the radar

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
and sadly all three of us are not going to be

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
going to E for All, but I am.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I'm going to go for E for All

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
to represent Orange Lawns Radio

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
and I know a lot of folks might be thinking why.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
E for All does not appear to be having

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
the big exhibitor list of other conventions

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
and to me I actually think

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
that's kind of the charm of it.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I want to go and promote Orange Lawns Radio

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
to the gamers that will show up

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
and from what I hear All Games

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
is going to have a heck of a booth there.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Their theme has to do with classic games.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I'm not sure how much I can and can't say

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
about the booth, but from what I've heard

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
it's going to be a good time.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
So if you're in the LA area

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
you should come out and check us out at E for All.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
I will be there.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
Also, best for last,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
OLRPSP.com, especially for you kids

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
that listen to Orange Lawns Radio on your PSP.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
If you have not checked this out yet,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
you've got to see this.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
On OLRPSP.com, Loki launched,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
just in time for Penny Arcade Expo,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
the All Games Radio Player.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
You actually download it to your crossbar.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
It's not spam or anything, don't worry.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
There's no ads or anything like that.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
What you do, you can actually listen

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
to All Games Radio right from your crossbar.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
It takes you right to this fancy player

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
that is awesome.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
You've just got to see it.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
You don't have to try and figure out

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
the radio tuner that's built in

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
that's really horrible trying to find

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
All Games on it or anything.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
You can just go 6 o'clock Sunday night,

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
or heck, if you want to tune in

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
to some of the other programming,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
tune in at 4.45 p.m. Pacific Sunday night.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
Go on your PSP to the Orange Lawns Radio

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
All Games listener, and you go right

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
to All Games Radio and listen to everything.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
It's great.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Check it out.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I can say how great it is without

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
sounding like I have an ego,

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
because Loki did it all.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
He really did a great job,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
not just for us representing Orange Lawns Radio,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
but for representing allgames.com.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Plus, he let out a series of colorful expletives

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
while he was working on it,

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
and that was pretty funny.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Yes, it was funny to watch.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
So, good times.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
So check that out, OLRPSP.com.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Also, we're trying something new tonight.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
OChat28 is giving an endorsement.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
It says the PSP All Games Radio

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
is pretty damn cool.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
chat.orangelawnsradio.com.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Tonight we're trying something new.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Since it is just Dark Soccer and myself

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
here in the studio,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
our Skype line is going to be open all night.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
We're going to take calls

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
as we get them tonight.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
We're trying something new.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
If you feel at any time you want to call in

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
and give us a call,

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
comment on what's going on.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
800 numbers back tonight.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Or our username on Skype,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Orange Lawns Radio.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
So we're not going to have a special segment

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
at the end of the show.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Instead, we hope you guys will tune in

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
when you have something to say

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
about one of the stories going on tonight.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And we'll see how it goes.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
But please keep in mind that

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
we don't want the same people to call in

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
over and over and over again.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
So once you've gotten through once,

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
please let some other people through.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Okay.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
So, yeah.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
At any time you can give us a call.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Skype line is open right now.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
I'll be reminding you of the number

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
throughout the show.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Now we can get into some gaming news.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Okay?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
And we'll start with some Rock Band.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
I know you're really surprised.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I'm still going to go hide under the couch.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
That's alright.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
As long as you're playing Rock Band.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Rock Band released a Penny Arcade Expo pack this week.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
It is $3 or 240 Microsoft points.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And what's pretty cool about it,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
all of the proceeds are going to the Child's Play charity.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Which, you know, Gabe and Tycho at Penny Arcade,

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
they love that.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And the other cool thing,

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
the performers in the PAX pack

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
were actually people that were at Penny Arcade Expo.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
So even if you were not there live at the show,

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
it's kind of like you could have PAX in your house a little bit.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And you can play along to Skullcrusher Mountain

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
by Jonathan Colton,

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
which you've got to love that here at Orange Lounge Radio.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
We've talked about that before.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Living on the Corner of Dude and Catastrophe by MC Frontalot

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
and Shh by Darkest of the Hillside.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I think it's three bucks.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
Shh, by the way, is a previously unreleased track.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
The other two songs have been released before

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
and they are all master recordings.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
So if you have Rock Band and you want to feel good

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
about donating to Child's Play and get some music at the same time,

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
there you have it.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Rock Band, PAX pack.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
I'm going to do my story now.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
Yeah, so Gee, Dark Soccer, do you have anything you want to share with us?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Oh, stop making fun of me, okay?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
You can't resist. It's my job.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Infinite Undiscovery has an ad on this.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
No, I'm just kidding.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Oh yeah, that was pretty too.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I forgot to mention Infinite Undiscovery.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
I bought it.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
And I played it for an hour

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
and I was extremely disappointed

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
compared to what I played at PAX.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
I thought at PAX, I had a good time at PAX,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
but I really hated the opening of this game.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
I think, God, the whole ogre chase thing

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
is not a way to start the game.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
That was a horrible idea

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
and it really just made me disinterested almost in the whole thing.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
It doesn't suck how like one poorly planned level

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
can just ruin an entire game.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
I'm going to try and stick it out

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
and try to get to some of the parts I saw at Penny Arcade Expo,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
but I was not happy with Infinite Undiscovery.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Anyhow, sorry, go ahead.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
Alright, well, the song list that I mentioned before

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
in order of difficulty is, for Rock Band 2, sorry,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
is Eye of the Tiger, Float On, Today, Hungry Like the Wolf,

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Cool for Cats, Pretend We're Dead.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
I love that song.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
My Own Worst Enemy, One Step Closer,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
We Got the Beat, That's What You Get, Rebel...

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Wait, this is Guitar Difficulty, right?

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Uh, it's, yeah, Guitar Difficulty, sorry.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Um, Rebel Girl, So What You Want,

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
that's actually pretty cool.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
Um, the next level up is Drain You, New Kid in School,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Hello There, Lump, American Woman, that's fun.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I Was Wrong, Night in the Afternoon,

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
I love that song.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Um, Mountain Song, Man in the Box,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Our Truth, White Wedding,

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
and, uh, E Pro, Solid, Psycho Killer.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I meant, Solid is the third stage.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
So, Psycho Killer, Spirit in the Sky, Kids in America,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Feel the Pain, oh, that's a good song too.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Give It Away, Conventional Lover,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
A Jagged Gorgeous Winter, Bad Reputation,

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
Pump It Up, You Oughta Know, Go Your Own Way,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Welcome to the Neighborhood,

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
and then Moderate is, uh, PVA, Shooting Star, Living on a Prayer,

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Deluxe, Girls Not Gray, One Way or Another,

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Tangled Up in Blue, Alex Chilton,

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
um, Alive, The Middle, Aqua Lung,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
dude, Aqua Lung, cool, Supreme Girl,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Challenging, we have, uh, Down with the Sickness,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Give It All, Where'd You Go, Come Out and Play,

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
Everlong, Pinball Wizard, that's also really cool,

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Rob the President, Testify,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
Uncontrollable Urge, Any Way You Want It, Round and Round,

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
Night Lies, and then, uh, what?

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
I was just gonna say, thank you, Harmonics, for the journey, I love you.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
Nightmare Level, now I'm thinking of Doom,

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
you know, was the last one, Hurt Me Plenty, anyway.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
But I don't wanna die.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Let There Be Rock, Alabama Getaway, Lazy Eye, Teenage Riot,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
The Trees, Vault Edition, Carry On, Wayward Son,

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
um, Rockin' Me, Ace of Spades 08,

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
I somehow miss that Carry On, My Wayward Son

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
is in that game, that is awesome.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
I'm sorry, this is good, I'm actually glad you're reading the whole list,

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
cause I forgot about how some of these songs are in rock band too,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
it's gonna be pretty awesome. Yeah, that's why I just had to do the whole thing.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Spoon Man Makes Me Happy, um,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
you know, before Chris Cornell damaged his voice and doesn't sound as awesome

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
as he used to, um, Almost Easy, Chop Suey,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
Shackler's Revenge, and then Impossible Mode

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
is Master Exploder, Ramblin' Man,

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
Shoulder to the Plow, Get Clean,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Colony of Birchmen, Peace Cells,

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
Souls of Black, um,

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Battery, Panic Attack, Visions, Painkiller,

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
so, there you go.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
Now see, the only bummer is that a lot of the songs I really wanna play

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
are not in the difficult category, but that's okay,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
you know, I understand, because they want the difficult songs to be the more

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
guitar, metal, stuff that I don't really listen to

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
usually, but man, as a whole,

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
that's probably my favorite, like, band game, and I'm counting

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Guitar Heroes as band games, song list yet, I, I'm

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
very excited about this game, uh, Rock Band 2, and it's only

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
going to be, uh, a few days away. Uh,

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
Quiltipo in Chat says, Master Exploder will be an interesting song

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
to sing. I think if you actually look at the list for vocals,

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Master Exploder's like, towards the easiest songs, I wonder

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
why. I'm curious what you guys think about the Rock Band 2

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
song list and the, uh, difficulties, 1877 Game

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLondrio, I'm kinda

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
curious if people are actually gonna call, or if everybody's gonna wait till the end, like

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
usual. That's why this is an experiment tonight.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
More Rock Band, I mean, we just have a

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
crapload of music game news tonight, especially, you know, as we're on the brink

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
of a Rock Band 2 being released, lots and lots of music game news

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
tonight, and, uh, the details are finally out for how you

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
are going to get your Rock Band 1 songs into Rock Band 2.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
It is available to happen now, even though Rock Band 2

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
is not technically out yet, you can start the exporting process.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
The whole process takes about 10 minutes, and it'll set you back

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
$5, and it'll allow you to take 55 songs,

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
take them out of Rock Band 1, and put them into Rock Band 2.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
There are a few songs that did not make the cut, um,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
due to licensing issues or whatever, but only a few.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
Paranoid, uh, by Black Sabbath, although it was a cover

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
to begin with, Run to the Hills by Iron Maiden,

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
and Enter Sandman by Metallica will not be making its way

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
to Rock Band 2. It is probably, uh,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
theorized, uh, Metallica is the next Guitar Hero solo game,

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
um, so that's probably why they're going with that camp.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
A lot of people are surprised that the Aerosmith song is actually

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
going over into Rock Band 2, but it was brought up by some good

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
commenters on some of the blogs I was reading that the, uh,

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
Train Keep on Runnin', that song that they have in Rock Band 1,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
was not originally written by them, therefore that's probably

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
why they don't have so much of a say as to, uh, that game,

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
or that song, uh, going into Rock Band 2 or not.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
So, uh, very cool. What you can do, it is in the

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
options menu of Rock Band 1, you can actually export.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
You'll get taken to a menu that will charge you the $5 fee,

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
and, uh, you can export the 55 tracks, takes about 10 minutes to do,

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
uh, and about 1.5 gigs on your hard drive,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
because you are riving those songs off the disc and turning them into,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
basically, download content is essentially what you're doing.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
But just think about it, I mean, if you do that,

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
when you put in Rock Band 2 on day 1,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
you're gonna have all those songs Dark Soccer just read,

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
and these 55 new ones, and anything you've downloaded from before.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
So, that's, that's gonna be a heck of a song list,

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
even though, you know, a lot of them have already played, but,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
that's neat. I'm looking forward to that.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Uh, it is a bummer that they have to recharge you for that,

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
but I guess that's a licensing thing and there's just no way around it.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
And, admittedly, $5, not too bad.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Not too bad.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
So, I gotta do that quickly before Rock Band 2 comes out,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
because you know there's gonna be tons of people that are ripping the songs,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
and then, uh, sell the game back.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I hope the game doesn't pull a gotcha,

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
and, like, at some point you have to insert the original Rock Band disc,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
or else we'll be screwed.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
Well, how about some Guitar Hero World Tour news?

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
And this makes me happy, because I'm a fangirl.

39:19.000 --> 39:26.000
Um, the, the, uh, latest who's gonna be in the game as a playable character is Sting.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
That makes me very, very happy, because I, like, I was a big police fan.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
Um, they're also, um, supposed to, uh, be, uh,

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
recreating, uh, Jimi Hendrix, Ozzy Osbourne, Zach Wilde, and Billy Corgan.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
So that's pretty cool.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
Um, but, it's gonna, you just have to find out, I guess,

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
if anyone else is gonna be in Guitar Hero World Tour when it comes out, so.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
That's kinda neat that there's, uh, the different, uh, famous folks in Guitar Hero,

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
but, you know, not surprising either, because you had, uh,

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
what, the guy from Poison, Bret Michaels, and Slash, and Tom Morello, so.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
I guess, uh, Guitar Hero likes to go for the celebrities.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
You know what I want?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Guitar Hero Gorilla's Edition.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Good luck.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
That could, that would be fantastic.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
I'm surprised, none of their songs have shown up in any games, though.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Any of these band games, anyway.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Have we had any blur?

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
I don't believe so. I could be wrong.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
I don't believe so.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
We've had Radiohead.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
I'm sure Chat will correct us if we're wrong.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
Yeah, but I would love to see Gorilla's Edition.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Yeah, you know what's pretty rad is that, um,

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
in Rock Band 1, when you're playing online,

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
uh, you get a random song that you play against your opponent with,

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
which I wish Guitar Hero did, so that way everybody didn't pick Through the Fire and the Flames.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
But in Rock Band, you get a random song when you're playing Score Attack or whatever.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
Um, and if you have download songs in common,

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
the random song might just be pulled from your download pool.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
So I've actually played, um, Perfect Drug against someone online.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
That's a download song.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
And today I did My Iron Lung by Radiohead, because that was a download song.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
And I thought that was pretty rad that that came up.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
And Radiohead's awesome anyway.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
And, yeah, and that way you know that the person you're playing with is cool,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
because they spent the money to download that song.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
So they must like Radiohead, too.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
So, pretty cool.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
Uh, Quiltipo would like to point out, Beatlebum is in Rock Band.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Ah.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
I thought there was one.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah, but there's better Blur songs than Beatlebum.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Give Me Coffee and TV.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
I like that song.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Honestly, if I was gonna-

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Girls and Boys, hello.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
No, no, no.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Love that song.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
For just the guitar in it, because I'm sorry, even though he had to be an ass.

41:31.000 --> 41:37.000
Graham Coxon is one of the, I would have to say, best guitar players out there.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
And I would love to have had Charmless Man in there,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
because the guitar in that would be really fun.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
Bobby's in chat saying, I want to play Rock Band with Rob,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
and I also want to play Civ Rev with Rob.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Bring it!

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
I haven't played Civ Rev in a while.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
There's been all these new games coming out,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
but I still love me some Civilization, don't get me wrong.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Um, well, you know, we've been gushing about Guitar Hero

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and Rock Band and all these guitar games all night,

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
and one person not so much gushing about Guitar Hero right now,

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
Matthew Sweet, and this actually is a little bit older news.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
It came up last week, but Penny Arcade Expo was kind of distracting us.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
Matthew Sweet is actually considering that he's gonna be doing a lawsuit against Guitar Hero 2.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
He says, quote, I've been trying to see if I can get a lawsuit against them

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
because they never asked to use the song.

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
A lot of kids have gotten into his music because of the inclusion of the song in the game.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
Quote, I found out that the Romantics have a lawsuit going against the makers of that game

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
because of the song, What I Like About You.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
He says, I don't know if the Romantics are gonna win their suit, but it's really weird.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
I've never sued anyone in my life, and I don't think it would amount to much anyway.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Hmm.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
So he's thinking about actually, even though he kind of admits more people get into the music,

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
he wants to sue the people that did Guitar Hero for putting his song in there.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
Although it was probably his record label that signed it away.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Doesn't make sense.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Probably.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
And honestly though, because I was actually, I don't know if you remember,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
I was really surprised to see Matthew Sweet's songs in there

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
because I've actually been a fan of Matthew Sweet since I was in high school.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
Ever since, no I take that back, ever since college because he did a couple of videos.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
One of them for a girlfriend that had clips from Cobra in it.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
He's a big anime fan, that's how I found out.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
And also one with lots of Urasayatsura clips in the video.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I've been waiting, that was the other one.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
And on top of that, I picked up quite a number of his albums because I have,

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
my favorite album that he did is Altered Beast, and he did one called Son of Altered Beast,

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
that has some of my favorite songs there.

43:41.000 --> 43:49.000
So to hear that he's wanting to sue a video game company for promoting his music,

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
because I thought that me and five other people liked him,

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
that's just sort of ridiculous I think.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
Yeah, you can be a fan of someone and still admit, smack, what are you thinking?

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
If one of my favorite musicians was doing this, I would say,

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
I like you, but what are you thinking, dude?

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
And yes, it was Space Adventure Cobra.

44:08.000 --> 44:14.000
It was a lot of clips from the super uber long movie version.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
Frisbee says sue someone, it's the American way.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
But here's the weird thing, Matthew Sweet references the romantics thing,

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
but that was actually thrown out of court, the whole romantics thing.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It got laughed out of court essentially.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
If Matthew Sweet is listening to our show, which I don't think he is,

44:28.000 --> 44:36.000
but if he is, don't sue, because it would be stupid and I'll lose a lot of respect for you.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Seriously?

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
And Keltipo, the Girlfriend album was very good.

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
You suing Guitar Hero will go over about as well as when Metallica sued Napster.

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
But I mean, you can actually kind of understand why Metallica sued Napster,

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
but in this case, you know, why so upset?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
You know, it gets more people into your music and so on.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
Is he just upset he's not getting more money out of the whole thing?

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Or what is that?

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
I mean, if you sell CDs because of it, what's the big fucking deal?

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
Well, now we've spun a whole Takahashi anime thing in chat

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
because I happen to mention Ura Sayatsura.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
And also, I think that Fire Tripper is a little better than some of those

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
if you have to go for individual stuff, the end.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
By the way, that interview is from the North County Times.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
If you want to check that out for yourself, nctimes.com.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
Did the interview on August 21st, which was when we weren't here.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
Hopefully he snaps out of it and doesn't end up suing the game

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
because I think that would be a little silly

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
and is just going to get a more negative publicity

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
amongst the people playing this game than positive.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
I think if he has issues with it, he needs to take it up with his record company

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
or whoever signed on the dotted line and licensed his song away.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
That is the person he needs to be going after

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
if he doesn't want this to happen in the future, in my opinion.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Well, your opinion counts because you are an internet celebrity.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Mm-hmm.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Well, how would...

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Okay.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
What?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I don't know if I'd say that, but okay, I'll take it.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
Oh, come on, the internet is serious business.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
Anyway, for something that, you know,

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
there is quite a bit of classic rock fans still left in the world.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
You know, I'm one, definitely.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
But there are some classic acts that are going to be re-recording

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
some master tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
Some of these are actually in...

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
I'd have to say MC5's Kick Out the Jams is going to be one.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
They're actually having some help from Alice in Chains member

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Jerry Cantrell and Guns N' Roses' Gilby Clark.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
Sex Pistols is putting up pretty vacant.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
And Motorhead re-recorded Overkill.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
I like Motorhead, by the way.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
So I think that that's pretty neat.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
There also, though, was apparently a little bit of trouble, though,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
with some of the tracks they're wanting to put in,

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
so they're all working on trying to get the bugs ironed out.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Hmm.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Could be interesting.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
I think so.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
We'll see what happens with that.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Now, you know, we've been talking a lot about music games,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
but let's not forget the music game that started it all,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
at least for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Dance Dance Revolution is still trucking along,

47:12.000 --> 47:17.000
and Hottest Party 2 and DDRX have gotten some more song announcements this week

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
about some of the songs that you're going to find in the game.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2, it's completely made up of covers,

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
but actually now there's also going to be some Konami originals in the game,

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
and those were some of the songs they announced this week.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
For example, we have Desert Journey by DJ Taka.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
A new song is going to show up in the game.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
Tera Kyouka's Suigetsu Row is coming out.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
And if you want to look at the full list yourself, ddronlinecommunity.com

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
if you want to see some of the other songs that are going to be in the game.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
I do want to also mention the songs that are coming to DDRX on the PlayStation 2.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Some new licensed songs.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
I thought this was interesting.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Naropa is coming back, and the reason why that's interesting

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
is because they're one of the different drum artists.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
So now you have the different drum songs going on to PlayStation 2.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
Feel is the song by Naropa that you're going to see in DDRX.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
Some more new edits of old classic DDR songs.

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
Remember Butterfly and Dubby Dub were getting recut and re-edited for DDRX.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
I don't know if you heard about that.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Some other songs got announced.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
Hero is coming. Remember?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
La da dee da da.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
You are my hero.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
But no, get this.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
Get Up and Move is also getting a new edit.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
Remember SNK? Get up and move.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
That wasn't a good song.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I didn't like it either, but some people do.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I was talking to Shane online.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
He was all excited about that song, but he likes a lot of crap.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
Well, you know, we can't say anything about Mr. High School Musical, so...

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Well, here you go. Here's something cool for you.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
How about Pet Shop Boys? Always on my mind.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Sweet!

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
There you go. Something for Jamie.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
So there you go.

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
Open from the Dub Pistols synthesized for the punk label Fat Rec Chords.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
The artist The Epixies was synthesized.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
So it looks like a variety of music.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
You have synth pop, punk, and bad music.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
All different genres.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
I'm just kidding.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Something for everyone.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
The bottom of the barrel of the Konami originals.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Yeah, exactly.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Trying to see if there's comments from chat.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
Some people are yelling out, get up and move.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
Frisbees remembering there was a sweet freestyle to it.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
I bet there was some pretty awesome freestyle to that song, though, actually.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
I've seen, you know, awesome freestyle done to really crappy songs, so...

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
Frisbee also says that they need to do the R21 patch for DDRX Arcade.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
You know, I'm not thinking that's actually going to happen.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
Needs more Too Unlimited.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
How about no?

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
Too Unlimited is like the quintessential Jock Jams band.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I guess.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
We're in the Twilight Zone.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Alright, forget it.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
That song nearly broke my ankle.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Let's talk about release dates!

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Some games that are coming out this week.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Loki's not here tonight, but fear not.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I've got the US release dates.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
Of course, today, Spore was the game that came out this week,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
along with Spore Creatures on the DS,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
which played a demo for that at PAX,

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
and you can safely stay away from that one.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
A lot of folks are very excited about NHL 2009.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
It's making its way out this week as well on a variety of systems.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
Also coming out, Lock's Quest on the DS.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Viva Pinata, Pocket Paradise.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
That's the whole really weird thing.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
You're seeing an Xbox franchise on a DS platform.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
Worlds Collide this week on the DS.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
That comes out September 8th.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Also coming out on the DS, The Price is Right,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
the game from none other than Ubisoft.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
That makes you happy, doesn't it?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
But it's not Bob Barker, is it?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Yeah, I don't know.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Some things just don't need to be made into games,

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
and I think that's one of them.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
They need to do classic Price is Right for you.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Also that does not need to be made into games,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Hell's Kitchen is coming out on the Wii,

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
along with the Price is Right port on the Wii.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
And Hell's Kitchen also made its way to the DS.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Shows just how easy games can go back and forth between the DS and the Wii.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
If you're more of a PC gamer, guess what?

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
You get Romance of the Three Kingdoms Part 11.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Comes out this week on PC.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
One would think that romance by now would be stale and dead.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
Dead beyond Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
I know it means romance in the classical sense.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
No, there are just rabid, rabid fans of that series.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
And, you know, I think all the way back to when that series was on the NES.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Dude, I spent a lot of nights playing Nobunaga's Ambition.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Remember, those games were awesome.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
They really were.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
I think it's neat that they've lived on through all this time.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
Maze is a Fate DS, a new role-playing game coming out for the DS this week as well.

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
And Dragon Ball Z Trilogy, because you just can never have enough Dragon Ball.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
It's coming out on PlayStation 2.

51:43.000 --> 51:49.000
Hey, and if you want some packaged games, CSI Super Pac on the PC.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Little known fact.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
Well, maybe this is a little known fact, but sometimes overlooked fact.

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
The CSI games are designed by the same folks who are very popular for their recent Strong Bad game.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
So, something to think about.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
If you're going to laugh off a CSI game, it might not be as bad as you think.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
The more you know.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
Oh, I did play the Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
Now, what did you think?

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
It was pretty cool.

52:13.000 --> 52:19.000
Especially with the seven-track player, it said that it was short-lived because the faulty part of it was the on-switch.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Uh-huh.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
There was none.

52:21.000 --> 52:28.000
I got to read some comments here from chat because they're making fun of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms thing.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
TheRobD says,

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
It needs to be like Madden.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
Romance of the Three Kingdoms 09 with a new roster.

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
And GameGuru reminds us there has to be a marriage of the Three Kingdoms first for there to be a divorce.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Because right now it's just Romance.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
That would have been part four.

52:40.000 --> 52:52.000
It's using Romance in an all-encompassing way because right now they're on the ongoing legal battle for custody of the Pet Chihuahua.

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
And Quel-Tippo makes the mandatory joke, in-joke here.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
How long can Lu-Bay and Cow-Cow go at it?

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
That's what Quel-Tippo wants to know.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Oh, baby.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
I know a game he's been playing.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
All right, forget it.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Hump, hump, hump.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
So how about other news?

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
How about it?

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
More stuff!

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
And it's all coming out on the 12th.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
At least in Europe.

53:18.000 --> 53:30.000
We have GTR Evolution on PC, Baha on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and PS2, and R-Type Command on PSP.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
And that's it.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
Slow week?

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
Drive-thru, do not pass go, do not collect $200.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Dang, fries are done.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
You lose, good day, sir.

53:42.000 --> 53:47.000
Over to Japan and the release dates over there are coming out on September 11th because their release dates are not the same as over here.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
I believe they're on a Friday.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
I have that day off of work, too.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Congrats, I guess.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Are they recognizing it?

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Oh, no, it's a Thursday, I'm sorry.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Are they recognizing it as a holiday now?

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
No, I asked off that day so I could go to San Francisco and go to art galleries.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Oh, gotcha.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
You know, that's actually Loki's birthday.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
I know.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
That might be part of the reason he's not here.

54:04.000 --> 54:11.000
He might be at a little thing for his day job, but I think secretly he might be wanting to spend some birthday time with the wife because his birthday is actually September 11th.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
You never forget when his birthday is.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
Well, my birthday was the Waco thing.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
So what tragedy happens on yours?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Actually, I did not get tragedy.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
I had some good things happen on my birthday.

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
One, sodomy laws were abolished in Texas on my birthday.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
You know, my birthday was also the day before Hitler's birthday.

54:30.000 --> 54:38.000
And I'd like to also point out Strom Thurman died on my birthday.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Just saying, yo.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
You asked what happened on my birthday.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
There it is.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
Draw whatever conclusions you want.

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
By the way, Strom Thurman also died the same day those sodomy laws were repealed.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Just food for thought.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
What?

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
What?

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
I like pie.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Do you?

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Rob.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
What?

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Rob.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Rob.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Rob.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Rob.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Rob.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Rob.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Rob.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Rob.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Rob.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Rob.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Rob.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Rob.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Rob.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Rob.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Guess what?

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
What?

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
All right, look.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Let's move to Japan in the release dates over there on Thursday, September 11th.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Viva pinata.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
You know that just here is Viva pinata part two.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
What's his subtitle for that?

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
I forgot.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
It's Viva pinata two?

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Something in paradise?

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
Yeah.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
Change AWS?

55:22.000 --> 55:23.200
There's a lot of people who are actually really into that game over here.

55:23.200 --> 55:24.720
Punching people in the face in paradise?

55:24.720 --> 55:27.960
I've actually seen a lot of really positive reviews on it.

55:27.960 --> 55:28.960
Death to pinatas.

55:28.960 --> 55:30.960
I don't think you can kill the pinatas yet.

55:30.960 --> 55:31.960
Pinata burning death.

55:31.960 --> 55:35.960
Although I am waiting for the minigame where you finally take a baseball bat to your damn pinatas.

55:36.960 --> 55:37.960
Have we had that happen yet?

55:37.960 --> 55:43.960
And find that their guts are made out of, you know, Tootsie Pops and Jolly Ranchers.

55:45.960 --> 55:52.960
The Rob D in chat says, I leave you to envision Skye celebrated the abolishing of sodomy laws with Strom Thurman on his birthday yourself.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.960
Let's just leave it to the imagination, folks.

55:55.960 --> 55:56.960
Why do you have to go there?

55:56.960 --> 56:00.960
Double Clutch comes out on the Xbox 360 in Japan, speaking of double entendres.

56:00.960 --> 56:02.960
Infinite Undiscovery.

56:02.960 --> 56:03.960
Game Grumps.

56:03.960 --> 56:04.960
Wow.

56:04.960 --> 56:06.960
Viva Pinata 2 electric boogaloo.

56:06.960 --> 56:09.960
These are all ways that you could celebrate the repeal of sodomy laws.

56:09.960 --> 56:11.960
Double Clutch and Infinite Undiscovery.

56:11.960 --> 56:14.960
There you go, coming out on the Xbox 360.

56:16.960 --> 56:20.960
Also a brand new 360 console in 60 gigabyte flavor.

56:20.960 --> 56:24.960
Coming out in Japan on the 11th on the Playstation 3.

56:24.960 --> 56:31.960
Double Clutch and Stranglehold makes its way as well to the Playstation 3 on September 11th.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.960
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

56:33.960 --> 56:40.960
One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1, Nami ni Yoryu Hiyohu is coming out.

56:40.960 --> 56:43.960
That's a Namco game, actually, coming out.

56:43.960 --> 56:47.960
I have no idea what it is or if it's something that they're releasing here, but there you go.

56:47.960 --> 56:50.960
Coming out on the handheld systems, let's take a look.

56:50.960 --> 56:53.960
Or, sorry, first let's revisit the Playstation 2 because, you know, it's still selling over there.

56:53.960 --> 56:57.960
Sega Ages 2500, are you listening, Jamie?

56:57.960 --> 57:04.960
Volume 33, Fantasy Zone Complete Collection on the Playstation 2.

57:04.960 --> 57:07.960
Do you know how much this would cost you to import?

57:07.960 --> 57:11.960
Less than $30, if you want to pick that up on the Playstation 2.

57:11.960 --> 57:12.960
I know.

57:12.960 --> 57:17.960
Well, you know, I've picked up a lot of the, um, I've actually got the Fantasy Zone remake that they did.

57:17.960 --> 57:23.960
Because I got, we got like the first three Sega Ages games that came out, the 2900 ones.

57:23.960 --> 57:25.960
2500, whatever.

57:25.960 --> 57:29.960
DJ Dark Knight, I don't think the game is Viva Pinata 2 Mercenaries.

57:29.960 --> 57:30.960
I think that's something else.

57:30.960 --> 57:34.960
Dark Tetsuya says, I think Sega heard that E all the way in Japan.

57:34.960 --> 57:37.960
And GS68 says, Jamie just fangasm.

57:37.960 --> 57:39.960
Can we get a mop in the studio, please?

57:39.960 --> 57:45.960
Hey! I actually held the microphone away from my face so that I didn't break anybody's eardrums.

57:45.960 --> 57:49.960
So, you all owe me money now for saving you a medical expense.

57:49.960 --> 57:51.960
Alright, and you know I love Princess Soft.

57:51.960 --> 57:56.960
And Princess Soft is releasing a game called Sashu Shiken Kujira Alive.

57:56.960 --> 58:00.960
Sweet, so sweet, is coming out from Princess Soft on the Playstation 2.

58:00.960 --> 58:03.960
Now we can visit the handhelds real quick and then we'll get back to some of the gaming news.

58:03.960 --> 58:05.960
I like the handhelds, don't you?

58:05.960 --> 58:09.960
Spore, shut up, Spore Creatures is coming out on the DS as well.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.960
It's just like, gosh, a bunch of other games.

58:11.960 --> 58:20.960
Gaken Mu Henshubu Kansu Choju Jinsu Research File comes out on the Nintendo DS as well.

58:20.960 --> 58:22.960
As well as some DS Vision games.

58:22.960 --> 58:28.960
And a game called, what is this, Hoshizora no Comic Garden.

58:28.960 --> 58:30.960
I wonder if that's an anime.

58:30.960 --> 58:34.960
Because it has a limited edition, usually limited edition games are games based on animes.

58:34.960 --> 58:37.960
And on the PSP this week, nothing.

58:37.960 --> 58:39.960
No games for you this week.

58:39.960 --> 58:40.960
Your mom, the game.

58:40.960 --> 58:42.960
Nothing for you on PSP, sorry to say.

58:42.960 --> 58:43.960
Thank you, pull forward.

58:43.960 --> 58:47.960
I'm adding that, by the way, to the list of official Orange Noms Radio wanted games.

58:47.960 --> 58:48.960
Your mom, the game?

58:48.960 --> 58:49.960
Your mom, the game.

58:49.960 --> 58:50.960
What would you do in your mom, the game?

58:50.960 --> 58:51.960
Well, you'd do...

58:54.960 --> 58:55.960
Zing!

58:57.960 --> 58:58.960
Nice, nice.

59:00.960 --> 59:02.960
Alright, that's it for Japanese release dates.

59:02.960 --> 59:03.960
You caught me in a very weird mood.

59:03.960 --> 59:04.960
Apparently.

59:05.960 --> 59:06.960
How about more news?

59:06.960 --> 59:07.960
How about it?

59:07.960 --> 59:10.960
Because No Gnus is Good Gnus with Gary Gnu.

59:10.960 --> 59:13.960
And if none of you get that, then you're too young.

59:13.960 --> 59:14.960
And I feel old now.

59:14.960 --> 59:16.960
Eurogamer Expo!

59:18.960 --> 59:24.960
Eurogamer is actually a very big, very popular site overseas.

59:24.960 --> 59:28.960
And they carry lots of good news and have Eurogamer TV.

59:28.960 --> 59:31.960
And I actually go to that site quite often.

59:31.960 --> 59:34.960
But Eurogamer Network is having Eurogamer Expo.

59:34.960 --> 59:37.960
And I've said Eurogamer a whole bunch of times in a row.

59:37.960 --> 59:42.960
But it's at the Old Truman Brewery, October 28th through 29th in London.

59:42.960 --> 59:45.960
And there will be some more details up there.

59:45.960 --> 59:50.960
But it will be two sessions each day, 11am to 4pm and 5pm to 10pm.

59:50.960 --> 01:00:02.960
Also going to be playable there, Street Fighter IV, Prince of Persia, Mirror's Edge, Little Big Planet, Tomb Raider Underworld, Far Cry 2, Fallout 3, Saints Row 2, and many more!

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.960
In other words, all the shit we already played at PAX.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960
Hey!

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.960
Just kidding.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.960
No, I think this is a great idea.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.960
Actually, we didn't get Rob, but we didn't get Street Fighter IV.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960
Alright, alright.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.960
And I don't believe I saw any Prince of Persia.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.960
I'm just messing.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.960
Gotta get your feathers all ruffled.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.960
We did get Velvet Assassin and that girl needed to eat too.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:38.960
So, at any rate, I would actually very much love for any of our European listeners, if you're going, write us up, review, take photos, get back, get some internet celebrity for yourself through our site.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.960
Which hopefully we'll have our new site done by the time Eurogamer Expo happens.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960
I personally will be at a steampunk convention.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:52.960
What made you, uh, what do you think provoked the idea of a Eurogamer Expo?

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.960
Well, don't really all they have is Leipzig over in Europe.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.960
This just seems kind of, like, sudden, you know what I mean?

01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.960
It just came out of nowhere.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.960
I think it sounds fun, especially if it's at a brewery.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.960
Don't get me wrong, it sounds fun and all, but it just seems very sudden.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.960
Beer and video games, how can you go wrong?

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.960
Alright, fair enough.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.960
They know how to party.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.960
By the way, we had some great drinks in Seattle.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.960
We went to, I like Tap House, but it was too hot.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.960
Yeah, Tap House was cool, and what was the other one, Von's?

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.960
Von's.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.960
Oh, yeah, I like the supermarket chain here, but it's a bar up in Seattle.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.960
They had, um, taps, um, from, like, different breweries all over the wall,

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.960
and they had in big bold letters on, uh, their banner outside,

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.960
We Do Not Serve Bud, and I was like, this place is already fantastic.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:43.960
And then they had, um, really, really good food, and I tried some very interesting beer.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.960
That was one of my favorite places, but we did not have, I gotta say, Seattle folks,

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.960
we did not have a single bit of bad food up in Seattle.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.960
I really didn't.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.960
We did eat.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.960
Y'all know how to eat.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.960
We did eat some fairly, a couple places we went to were a bit more upscale

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.960
than I think we were anticipating, but.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.960
Still, I've eaten some shitty food here locally.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.960
Look, I've eaten off the menu at Cheesecake Factory, which you know I don't,

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.960
I don't enjoy their lunch at all.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.960
They have good breakfast, though.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.960
I don't, I don't, I don't think, you don't go to Cheesecake Factory for the food,

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.960
or for cheesecake, but I had some great food in Seattle, which ironically,

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.960
there was a lot of people going to Cheesecake Factory in Seattle,

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960
but I was kind of like, what's the point?

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.960
We went to Sago World Grill, and that was cute.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.960
Sago World Grill was great.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.960
Best burger I've ever had in a really good pizza.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960
So anyway.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:24.960
Good times.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.960
Anyway, sorry.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:26.960
And foodio!

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.960
Mm, orange lunch foodio.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.960
Uh, well, you know, we could eat some foodio and play Halo 3.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.960
Halo 3 Mythic was apparently spotted by some folks at Penny Arcade Expo.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.960
Halo 3 Mythic showed up just before the Penny Arcade Expo official kickoff.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.960
I wonder if one of the press folks actually snuck a picture of that,

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960
what was going on.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.960
But apparently, Halo 3 Mythic is something that was kind of poking through,

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.960
maybe something that shouldn't be announced yet,

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960
that's going to be coming out soon.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.960
Apparently, Halo 3 Mythic only has a multiplayer-only menu,

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.960
and it's version 1.2.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960
Kind of interesting.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.960
What's also interesting about it is that possibly there are some new achievements

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960
coming from this as well.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.960
And who knows, it could be Photoshopped or whatever,

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.960
but apparently, if this Halo 3 Mythic thing is true,

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.960
there's 30 new achievements coming with it.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.960
That's 750 gamer points for achievements such as

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.960
Came From Behind, Flag Dropped, Defend This, Double Double,

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.960
and Vidmaster Challenge Annual,

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.960
which has no gamer score but is an achievement nonetheless.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.960
If you want to see the full list of those,

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.960
they are available on some various blogs out there.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:36.960
They went originally on the Ascendant Justic forum.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.960
So check that out.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.960
You Halo 3 fans.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.960
Well, other things to check out that would definitely enable some Halo 3 action.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.960
The Xbox 360 price cut is official, actually,

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.960
as of the 5th of this month.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.960
They've dropped the price of the 60 gigabyte to $2.99,

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.960
and the Xbox 360 Arcade to $1.99,

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.960
and the 360 Elite to $3.99.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.960
Basically, I guess it's just going to pave the way for more sales,

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.960
and I hope that they're not...

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.960
I would think that they've gotten past where they were working

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.960
at a loss on their consoles, don't you think?

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.960
They might still be taking a little loss,

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.960
but I think for them to be price point under the Wii,

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.960
it might just be worth it.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.960
Seriously, and to be perfectly honest,

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960
and this is, again, my opinion,

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.960
and the system is only as good as the games that are on it,

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.960
as I've said many times,

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.960
but I think that the Xbox 360 right now has the better library,

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.960
and I think them dropping the price of the systems

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.960
while keeping the titles where they are now

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.960
is a very smart move and should definitely turn in a profit for them.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.960
I think that's a very good idea,

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.960
because honestly, the games are great.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.960
There's been very few things that I haven't really enjoyed playing on Xbox 360.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.960
Who doesn't like cheap? Who? No one.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.960
The people that bought Yaris.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.960
Zing. Maybe that, but really, that's it.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.960
Who doesn't like cheap?

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:17.960
I really like Cheap Cheap's cooking show on Parappa.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.960
So we'll see if the price cuts move more systems,

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.960
because a lot of folks are forecasting that it's going to move big amounts of systems,

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.960
because there's going to be people to go in trying to get Wiis,

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.960
and folks aren't going to be able to get it,

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.960
so they're going to get an Xbox 360.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.960
We'll see.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.960
Katamari's Forever in chat says,

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.960
Oh no, now the Wii will have lower sales than the 360.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.960
Really, though, if you want Wii, you'll get Wii no matter what.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.960
Scalper, anyone?

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960
There you go.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960
Misty says, I still say Poopy on Arcade.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.960
Not enough storage space for my planned Rock Band downloads.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.960
So it's a very good point.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.960
Even though the system might be cheaper than the Wii,

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.960
it's not the greatest Xbox 360 system,

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.960
and I think there's going to be a lot of people out there that are going to find this out the hard way.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.960
And then they have to fork over that extra $100 anyway a little later on for the hard drive.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.960
That's going to be tough.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.960
We've got one more story for you guys before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.960
I can't stress this enough.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.960
This is rumor and rumor only,

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.960
but apparently it's very interesting that this rumor is timed as soon after Penny Arcade Expo as it is,

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:27.960
and that rumor is that right now E3, the board behind E3, is in talks to make E3 public.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.960
Why not?

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.960
It's worked so well for Penny Arcade Expo.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.960
They are talking about making it public.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.960
Apparently the idea has officially been brought forward to the Entertainment Software Association,

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.960
and that could mean as soon as next year the show could be public.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.960
Now that could also be a bunch of wishful thinking,

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.960
but we have heard a lot of developers and organizers talking pretty openly about the E3 sucks now.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.960
A lot of them were the same ones who said,

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.960
It sucked before. We want it to be private.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:04.960
But what's also interesting to note is that with that you have a lot of people praising Penny Arcade Expo,

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.960
and I've got to say this compared to something we didn't talk about earlier in the show,

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:14.960
and I know PAX is an E3, and we've heard tons and tons of comparisons,

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:19.960
and that PAX is what everybody thought E3 was going to be when they heard about E3,

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.960
and PAX is just all this stuff.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:28.960
But just asking directly, comparing the two shows since we've been fortunate to go to both

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.960
and talking about old E3 and PAX, at least I know what I noticed.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.960
One thing I noticed, people were way more laid back at PAX.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.960
It was great. I thought it was fantastic.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.960
Keep in mind, you've got so many people in such an area.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.960
Even as big as E3 was, there's going to be tensions running.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.960
You've got a lot of professionals that have to get from appointment to appointment to appointment.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.960
We had to do that, especially our last year at E3.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.960
How many appointments did we set up trying to get interviews and visiting?

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.960
Exactly.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.960
Because we didn't have to schedule interviews, the developers, those who made it,

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.960
were just there chatting about everything and being so open about the games

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.960
and letting everyone take pictures and not having all this crap,

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.960
especially people with a bug up their butt and not letting you take pictures,

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.960
which they did this year here at PAX. They were great about it.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.960
But it was just so completely laid back. Everyone was friendly.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.960
Even the enforcers. I'd say they were all fantastic.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.960
They did a great job, and they were friendly.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.960
They were very personable, the ones I dealt with.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.960
Pardon my French, but everybody had to stick up their fucking ass at E3.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.960
That's always been my problem with E3 is that people are very snobby.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.960
I don't know if that's the LA thing or what it is,

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.960
but I don't like getting treated like shit at a video game expo.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.960
You've heard the stories I've told on this show about some of these big media gatherings

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.960
that we've been to in the past and how we're looked down on.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.960
They're like, oh, my independent podcast. They don't have millions of listeners.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.960
I just threw something. I'm so angry.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.960
A lot of people have sticks at their ass. Not to say everybody is like that at E3.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.960
There's some very cool people at E3, but at PAX, everybody was awesome.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.960
Developers are out there on the floor mingling with people.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:18.960
Loki played some game, and I watched the people come up to him and say,

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.960
oh, so did you like it? Loki was like, yeah.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.960
He was trying to be nice and give a positive answer.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.960
They actually said, what did you like about it? What was cool about it to you?

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.960
I like that they were asking for feedback.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.960
That guy from Guitar Hero, and I apologize, I forgot his name.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.960
He didn't have a business card to give me.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.960
He talked to us for quite some time after the interview he did on All Games Radio.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:38.960
He was very cool.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.960
He did confirm for me that there is no bonus peripheral for studio mode.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.960
There you go.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.960
You heard it first.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.960
There you go.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.960
It was very cool. People were just hanging out.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.960
The guy from Warhammer Online was hilarious when we had him on the show.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960
Then I saw him later on the show floor.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.960
He was just hanging out, chilling, showing off the game.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.960
People are so much more laid back at PAX.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.960
I ran into my DM again, and he waved at me.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:07.960
If they put it on the floor at PAX, they realize the pictures are going to be all over the internet.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.960
People have finally gotten over it, and they don't try to control it so much at PAX

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.960
because they realize it's a gamer thing.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.960
So if E3 is going to take that step, that's a big step for E3.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.960
A lot of people are going to have to change their attitudes. Cap'n!

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960
Just saying.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:30.960
You know, I still didn't have quite the problem that you guys had at E3.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:37.960
But I think that a lot of it has to do with...

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.960
I'm just saying, Luke, who didn't go to PAX?

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:40.960
Yeah.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.960
Some people can't handle it, I guess.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.960
Because PAX is too coo.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:51.960
Anyhow, we actually asked this question on our pre-OLR Twit on our Twitter.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.960
Twitter.com slash OLR at us on Twitter.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.960
There's been quite a few people to have this week, so thank you guys very much for that.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.960
And we hope you enjoyed the updates from Jamie's iPhone at Penny Arcade Expo.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.960
I was in charge of the...

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.960
And sometimes the pictures didn't attach with the text I included.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.960
So, oops.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:08.960
Oh, how funny.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.960
But awesome technology, because we had the All Games listeners, and as it was going on,

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.960
I think you actually took, because we weren't able to do live video, just due to bandwidth,

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.960
but you would actually take, I think when the guy was there with this Game Boy playing the song,

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.960
you took a picture of it, put it on Twitter, and within a minute,

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.960
it made its way into the All Games chat room so people could see it.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.960
So it wasn't video, but it was definitely instant media, which was great.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.960
I was just thinking that if people were actually keeping up with the Twitter,

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:37.960
I wanted them to see who we were talking to while we were live, so that's what my thought was.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.960
Some comments from the Twitter to people that responded to our question.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.960
We asked, hey, there is a rumor that E3 is going public.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.960
Is this a good idea or a bad idea?

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.960
DJ Rama S says, good idea.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.960
I mean, a lot of other Expos are public, so why not?

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.960
As long as you pay for a pass and follow the rules, fair game.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.960
Quiltipo says, capital idea.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.960
I've always wanted to meet D-list celebrities.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.960
Because remember, E3 went under because of Paris Hilton and stuff.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.960
But even PAX had their D-list celebrities.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.960
I mean, you know, if you consider Jonathan Colton, Wil Wheaton, Freezepop, you know.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960
But we had cool people there.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960
That's true.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.960
People that actually cater to the nerd crowds.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.960
We had people there who worked for their fame.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.960
To be fair, E3 did have Adam West.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.960
To be fair.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.960
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.960
Anyway.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.960
Also, I want to point out, Misty OLR responded and said, public?

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.960
You mean it wasn't public enough with all the loopholes that got exploited?

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.960
She says, bad idea, I think.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.960
Especially with your report of the last E3 you went to.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.960
Act Def says, considering the success of Penny Arcade Expo, I think they want to emulate that to redeem themselves.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.960
I do hope they get it right, though.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.960
I apologize if I managed to announce this name.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.960
Giovedea? G-I-O-V-E-D-A? Giove?

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.960
Oh, my bad.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.960
It says, bad idea for the whole time, but good idea to open it public for a day.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.960
It's an industry expo, not a convention.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.960
And you know, that's something I've heard a lot, is make it more like Tokyo Game Show, where it's closed for one day, but open for the rest.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.960
And I think that would be fair. I think a good conclusion.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.960
And DROfWarC, I think that might be Doctor of Warcraft or something like that?

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.960
I don't know. DROfWarC says, screw E3 going public.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.960
PAX is the new thing in town.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.960
But really, it wouldn't hurt to have the two West Coast shows.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.960
Forget E for No One.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.960
Hey, wait a minute. I'm going to E for No One. Come on.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.960
It might actually be kind of cool. You never know what might happen.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:32.960
So, again, if you want to get the pre-OLR Twits and respond to a story before the show goes live, check us out on Twitter.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.960
Our username? O-L-R.

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.960
Really hard to remember, I know.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.960
Really difficult.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.960
Alright, we are about to go to, Rama says, you butcher Japanese and Italian.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:47.960
Yes, I do. Look, foreign language was my one weakness in high school, if it's not completely obvious here on this show.

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:48.960
Okay?

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.960
So, there you go.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:58.960
Como te llama. Alright, let's go to a much better segment than me horribly mispronouncing names here on the show.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.960
And talk about the classic video game of the week.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.960
Every week, Dark Sakura goes into the archives and pulls out a classic video game she thinks you all should be playing.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.960
And I got to tell you, this week, she went far into the archives this week.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.960
So, Dark Sakura, what should all the kids be playing this week?

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.960
The game of the week is actually quite the obscure little title called Puzzle and Dessu.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:36.960
Which, also, if you happen to find the name actually written in Japanese text, the first part of it's in katakana and the last part's in hiragana and the second part's in katakana, which is very weird.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:43.960
But anyway, it's a little puzzle game where you're this guy with a pointy hat who looks like a naked gnome.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.960
And the game plays...

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.960
That's the Travelocity Gnome with no pants.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:55.960
The game itself plays sort of like a combination of Pengo, Columns, and Bomberman.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:07.960
And the publisher on this game, for those who actually keep up with putting that on the wiki, is Nichibutsu Nihon Busan.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:16.960
It was actually released on April 14th, 1995, and I almost bought a copy at PAX, but I didn't.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:24.960
But anyway, the way that it works is that you've got these four different colored blocks, and you have to make all of them touch.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:35.960
However, if three of them touch, then they vanish, and you may actually lose the entire puzzle and the time limit that you're given, because you haven't made all the blocks vanish.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:46.960
And actually, because it is that weird and obscure, I'm going to be linking one of the images into the chatroom so that they can see what it's like.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.960
And honestly, if you can...

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.960
People are playing emulators, just freaking download it already.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.960
It's a really fun little game.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:03.960
But keep in mind, as you get further and further into the game, it actually comes up a bit more like Super Silkeban, if anyone's played that.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.960
And you have such a massive challenge on trying to get your blocks touching.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.960
Basically, you have to shove them in position.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:16.960
But, as you go further, you'll get some with percentage marks on them that are immobile.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.960
You get ice blocks that will dissipate when they touch another object.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:29.960
You have arrow blocks, which you can only push in the direction that they're pointing.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:40.960
You've also got a block, because you can actually play multiplayer, you can block other people from making different moves.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:45.960
And then you've got teleport blocks that you can move them around.

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:50.960
So it's just a very, very interesting little game.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.960
It gets very, very challenging.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.960
And it's definitely one if you like a game that makes you think a little bit.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:03.960
But it is only, you cannot play against the computer, it's only against people.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.960
Or you can do single-player mode, which is just you.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:11.960
It's really just a fun little game, really it is.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.960
That's all I can say about it.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:22.960
Really obscure to the US market, but I think there's been another game similar to this release in the US, but for the life of me, I can't rumble with this.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.960
So...

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.960
I know, I want to say I've played a game like this too, and I don't know what the hell it is.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.960
But it drove me nuts, it's hard. This is a hard game.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.960
But I will put the name of it in the chatroom, so they can look it up.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.960
Or you can actually look at the same YouTube I'm looking at here, Puzzle Endesu.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.960
D-E-S-U. Very easy to spell.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.960
Yeah, I just blogged the name in.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.960
And we'll link the, if you want to, since you've got it up, if you'll link that in the chatroom.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.960
Sure.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:50.960
But it's really fun.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.960
And remember, if you want to see these links as they show up, you've got to listen live to us on Sunday nights.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.960
Chat.OrangeLauncherDude.com to join our chatroom.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.960
And AllGames.com is where we're broadcasting every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific time.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.960
There it is, your classic game of the week, Puzzle Endesu.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.960
Very simple game that will drive you nuts.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:15.960
No calls during part A. I guess people don't like the whole, or they're just not used to it, the whole calls during the show thing.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.960
So we'll just have to open it up at the end of B like usual.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.960
So much for that experiment.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.960
Well, you try new things.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.960
Call us!

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.960
Nah, I already shut it off for now.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960
No, Colton, come back on part B.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:30.960
No, we're already in hour 20 for part A, so we've got to take a break, so we can get to part B.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.960
All right, we'll get on part B.

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.960
Don't worry, we'll have time for calls in part B.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.960
It's just folks are used to the end of the show.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:37.960
So we'll do that.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:38.960
We're going to take a quick break.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.960
We'll be back, though, with more of OrangeLauncher Radio right after a quick break.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:51.960
We'll see you then.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:57.960
Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here from OrangeLauncher Radio with an important message.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:03.960
Every year, thousands of yellow wizards are about to die from a horrible outbreak, food shooting.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:08.960
Shooting food causes the loss of life in many red warriors and green elves across the planet.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:14.960
Elf needs food badly, so please think twice before shooting food this holiday season.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:22.960
The Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:31.960
Remember, don't shoot food.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.960
She's calm.

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.960
There are a couple of other things I just tell you and I remember.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:36.960
He's crazy.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:42.960
If you could not see the similarities and the personalities within, like, the first couple of episodes, you need brain surgery.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.960
I mean, seriously.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.960
Can two people get together and record a podcast without driving each other crazy?

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960
Slap.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.960
Oh, you don't have to hurt me so hard.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.960
It wasn't that hard.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:56.960
Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your hosts, DJ Ron Ma S and Kuro Usagi.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:09.960
Hi, I'm G-Steel, and I just want to say that you are all losers for listening to video games called music.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.960
Music from video games is just a bunch of beeps and blips.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:19.960
I don't understand how people say music from, say, Final Fantasies, Frees of Rage, or maximum genius music.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.960
It's from video games and therefore talent-less garbage.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.960
Music that Shiro and Ugo Uematsu can partake of by genitalia.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.960
Video games locked in good health from making people out of electronic beef.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:34.960
Don't listen to real music because music that has no tolerance needs to be banned.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:35.960
Can't think's fine.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:40.960
P.S. This PSA is brought to you by La Molana, home of the never-ending hell-tempo music.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.960
Gaming Radio.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.960
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.960
Uh, mooch, uh, moo-kaw-key.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.960
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.960
Tax cuts.

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:59.960
Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 7th, 2008.

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.960
For our 293rd episode, if you can believe it.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:08.960
There was a little boo-boo in the numbering of the podcast last week, and some folks think they got episode 291 twice.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.960
But no, it was just misnumbering, an error on my part.

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.960
Shoot me.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.960
Remember, don't shoot Rob. Rob is not food.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.960
Uh, not with us tonight, of course.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.960
Techmaster Loki is out for the night, but that's okay.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.960
It's Dark Soccer and myself, feeling the love.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.960
But just platonically, thank you.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:26.960
She's married, I'm gay.

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.960
Alright, you guys are filling in as the co-hosts tonight.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.960
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have some things you want to say.

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:38.960
Um, some folks commenting on the various commercials there that were being played during the break.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.960
Having to recycle a little bit.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:45.960
If you have some promos that you want to have played during our free break, send them on in to us.

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.960
Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you can send me an email.

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.960
So, alright.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:56.960
Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some gaming news this week with some news on the PSP.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.960
Sony PSP and PlayStation 3 spend a little time in Sony Land right now.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:09.960
And this is kind of interesting is that they are now going to be launching a Wi-Fi store on the actual PSP.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:14.960
The PlayStation Store is actually coming to the PSP and you can do that.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.960
That will be happening this fall in Japan, but probably it's going to inevitably happen over here as well.

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.960
I mean, if there's money to be made, why not?

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.960
Sony, by the way, is also going to be launching a new infrastructure mode.

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:30.960
This is something that happens when you connect the PlayStation, or the PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.960
And you can do this all wirelessly.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:39.960
And then what happens is that you can actually do some type of like multiplayer modes through a PlayStation 3 connection for some games.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:45.960
So you kind of use your PlayStation 3 as like a hub to kind of do wireless stuff between the PSP.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.960
Which is kind of interesting.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:54.960
Could be interesting to see what they do with that, but certainly there's been a lot of love between the PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation 3.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.960
So it's very neat to see those two work together.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:04.960
In a way, it seems like Nintendo is just catching up in that regard with the whole DS demos finally making their way to the Wii just a couple months ago.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.960
We've been waiting.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960
Huh, nice.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:16.960
Well, I'll tell you other things though that we've been waiting for, at least people who are fangirls like me or fanboys not like me because I'm a girl.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:26.960
Of course, we all knew that Kingdom Hearts was going to be a PlayStation 3 exclusive and there's going to be something about that at Tokyo Game Show.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:32.960
Well, really though, it's a rumor.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:37.960
But, you know, we won't know unless we hear something official from Tokyo Game Show.

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:43.960
But honestly though, given that Kingdom Hearts has already been pretty much strictly...

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.960
Well, except for the DS version, which doesn't count.

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:57.960
But seeing that Squeenix has been sticking with Sony for this franchise for the most part, I wouldn't be surprised if it's going to be a PS3 exclusive.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.960
So, we'll see.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:07.960
All right. By the way, I just want to point out Loki, he's not here tonight in studio, but he joined our chat room just a minute ago. I guess he's back from San Francisco.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:11.960
He just said, I was tired from the San Francisco trip, so he's entertaining our folks in chat room.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:19.960
And he's rubbing it in their faces that apparently everybody just at his work got a vacation to their choice of ten destinations.

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:23.960
It was a little prize they all won tonight and he's rubbing that in everyone's face.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.960
So if you want to slap Loki, you can do that in our chat room tonight.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.960
chat.orangesolentrated.com if you are listening live.

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.960
Remember, it's the slash slap command, or you can right click.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.960
And I was actually, I was asking Loki, where are you taking me? But he's mumbling this stuff about having to take the wife.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.960
What's up with that?

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.960
I go places without Dan. He's not too happy about it, but I do.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.960
All right. All right. Back to video games and the real world and so on.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.960
No, that's cool. Hope he has fun wherever he goes.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.960
But he better not miss another Sunday or he's so fired. No, I'm kidding.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.960
All right. Yeah. I'm special and get to miss Sundays, huh?

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.960
No, no, no. He did an awesome job with the PSP or our PSP site.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.960
So there you have it. And I'm actually I'm going to be gone in a couple of weeks for you for all.

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.960
So lots of radio hosts taking the week off. All right.

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:18.960
Anyhow, PlayStation Network games also going to be simul launched in the UMD form.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.960
I think this is kind of interesting. Apparently, this is actually going to be happening in Europe with a couple of games that are coming out.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:30.960
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is actually going to be releasing collections of PlayStation Network titles that are going to be on UMD.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:35.960
There's the power pack, which is going to have the games flow siphon filter, combat ops and beats.

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:39.960
And the puzzle pack will include Lemmings, go puzzle and go Sudoku.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.960
So for those of you that didn't feel like getting the games on the PlayStation three or you've still been too cheap to get a PlayStation three.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:49.960
Now you can get these on UMD for the PlayStation portable, which I think is kind of interesting there.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:55.960
It's kind of interesting that there is still that cohesiveness between PlayStation three and PSP.

01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.960
I think that's kind of interesting that the titles are so I know we joke a lot about the DS and the Wii getting a lot of the same ports.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:07.960
But I mean, for real, you're seeing like the exact same games, exact same thing going between the PSP and the PlayStation three.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.960
It's kind of interesting. So you'll be able to check that out in Europe.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.960
Honestly, I imagine if it sells well over there, it's probably only a matter of time before that stuff comes out over here.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.960
I mean, where there's money to be made. Right. We'll see.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.960
Oh, that's pretty much the way that it works, isn't it?

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:28.960
Well, at any rate, we do have some other news.

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:37.960
We also have some information about a little big planet supposed to be having a limited public beta this month.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.960
And I think that's pretty cool.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.960
There's no other details about it, but they said there you'll be able to sign up for it.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:50.960
It just doesn't say how or when or well, but it will be made public right before the test is to be launched.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.960
They also do have an invite only method.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.960
So they said they'll be large enough that people around the world will be able to have fun with it.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.960
So like a Gmail thing, remember when Gmail invites were very rare or wait, no, no, no.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.960
Live journal. Remember when like you got one invite code for live journal?

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.960
Yeah. Remember that? Unless you paid. Yeah.

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.960
And then you could pay and get a bunch more, but you could invite one person to live journal.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.960
It sounds like it might be like that where you get to invite one person.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.960
Could be interesting. Who knows? It could be.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:22.960
Somebody send me an invite, please.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.960
If I get a PlayStation 3, then I'll want one of those invites, too. We'll see.

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:28.960
We could all pass along the invites to each other if that's how it works.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.960
Although I somehow bet there'll be some controls on that somehow.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.960
I don't think they'll give it to just anyone. Maybe.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.960
We'll see.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.960
One game that's been brought up earlier, and it's a popular PSP game, and somebody was talking about this in chat earlier.

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:46.960
DJ Max. Have you ever played this game? It's pretty much BeatMania 2DX, but with your PSP.

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.960
And it's Korean, which is interesting.

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:53.960
Miklotov, you know, old buddy of the show, he loves this game, and he's brought it over a couple times.

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.960
There's some very funny videos on there, and the game's kind of interesting.

01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.960
And so obviously a lot of our music game fans love this series, DJ Max.

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.960
Well, guess what? More DJ Max games coming out.

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.960
Pentavision has announced they are coming out with two new titles.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.960
Pardon me for horribly mispronouncing these names, but there's Clasequel Edition and Black Square.

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.960
I know I got that one right.

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.960
Pentavision is actually going after both the hardcore and the casual gamers.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:23.960
It's not really said if these two splits are for that purpose.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.960
Maybe one is easier than the other. Who knows?

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.960
Who knows if one's got more casual mode and another one is for the more hardcore player.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.960
But you know if you're a DJ Max fan, you're getting them both anyway.

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.960
So what's the matter?

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.960
There's going to be folks that import both no matter what happens.

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.960
Well, there you go.

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:46.960
Some folks have noticed that there is a lot more mainstream music in the Clasequel Edition.

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.960
So maybe there's more like, you know, the MTV of Korea.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.960
Those type of artists are in this, you know, CE.

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:57.960
And then Black Square maybe has more of the originals. Who knows?

01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:58.960
Maybe.

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:03.960
Some folks in comment or some folks in chatroom are definitely feeling pretty hardcore about this.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:06.960
Gsquared68 is a fan of the game and says, wait, what?

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.960
Oh, they're probably just limited editions.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:11.960
They need a feature that tracks percentage and not just score.

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:15.960
Scoring system equals combo based equals epic fail.

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.960
But Act Def says, yay, DJ Max.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.960
So there you go.

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:26.960
Well, on other PlayStation news, and this should make some of our European listeners happy,

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.960
is that there will be randomly selected PS3 owners in Europe

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:35.960
who will be able to get the demo of Motorstorm Pacific Rift,

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:41.960
which was only exclusive to the US for people who bought copies of Core on PSN.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:51.960
For any of the players in Europe who also, I do believe, purchased the game,

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:57.960
it will be available, and it's supposed to include the Air Zone track.

01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:01.960
So you can give it a try, and it has support for single player and two player split screen.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.960
So it'd be cool.

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:08.960
And actually, it's supposed to be free for a few days before the official release.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.960
Motorstorm 2 is very pretty, what I saw.

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:13.960
It was a very popular demo, so I didn't get to get my hands on it,

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.960
but it looked very pretty from what I noticed.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:19.960
Sorry, I like the jungle scape much more than the dirt of the first one.

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:20.960
Yeah.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:22.960
I think the jungle was a much better setting for the game,

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:25.960
although I would like to see, I don't know, if it's too much to ask for a game with a little more diversity.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.960
Give us some jungle and some dirt.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:28.960
Those are the great racing games.

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.960
Even Excite Truck did that.

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:31.960
Dirt.

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:32.960
Exactly.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:44.960
Well, guess what game you get to experience all over again.

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:45.960
That's right.

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:46.960
All over again.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:53.960
And if the PC wasn't enough, and the PSP wasn't enough, and the Xbox 360 wasn't enough,

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:56.960
you get to get shining and luminous.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.960
And your mobile phones weren't enough.

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:02.960
You get to do this all over again on the PlayStation Network.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.960
That's right.

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.960
Luminous Supernova was announced on the PlayStation Network this week,

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:09.960
and it is the same game you know and love.

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.960
But with some new stuff, you know there's going to be some new skins, some new songs, and some new modes.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.960
They've announced Dig Down Mode.

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:21.960
You use the falling blocks to erase squares from the play field that already has blocks on it.

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.960
So it's basically clearing a crap play field, kind of like Tetris had a mode like that, where the well was already full.

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:27.960
Mr. Driller!

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.960
No.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.960
Well, a little different, because that's the whole game of Mr. Driller.

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.960
Sequencer mode, though, sounds kind of neat.

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:37.960
You can actually make your own background music using the sound loops that are in the sound bank.

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:42.960
Drums, bass, synthesizer one, synthesizer two, and effects, 20 different loops.

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.960
So you get to kind of make your own songs using the sequencer.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.960
But then again, I think this sounds exactly like, I don't know if you've ever played the Spice World video game,

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.960
where you can make your own Spice Girls song.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.960
Pretty much the same thing.

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.960
I mean, really, when you break it down, it was just...

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.960
Spice World was a crabby game!

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.960
No, it was awesomely bad.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.960
It was like the showgirls of video games.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.960
It was so bad, it was actually kind of good.

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.960
So there you have it.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.960
Supernova, 40 unlockable skins in challenge mode.

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.960
Also, of course, skin edit, time attack, puzzle mission modes.

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.960
Two-player versus mode.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:19.960
No release date set yet, and it's not known if it's going to take the microtransaction approach

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.960
that made this game so controversial on the Xbox 360,

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.960
where you only buy the base game and then have to buy everything separate.

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.960
My gut tells me no.

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.960
That they're not gonna, because it didn't go over well on the 360,

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:34.960
they'll just charge one big price for the whole thing on the PlayStation Network.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.960
But we'll see. Time will tell.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.960
I do like the skin that they released on one of the screenshots here.

01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:43.960
It looks like a little 8-bit, I don't know, I'd call it like an Earthbound kind of graphic.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.960
The guy looks like a character from Earthbound, kind of like running through a background

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:49.960
of an arcade-looking thing, so that already looks cool.

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:53.960
It's not NES. It's Earthbound-like.

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.960
I don't know, I only say that because it's a little kid wearing a baseball cap, so it reminds me of that.

01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.960
But there you have it.

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.960
So, yeah, it's going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:06.960
I'm kind of not interested because whatever they put in this game will be recycled into Luminous 3,

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:08.960
which I'm sure is inevitable.

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:11.960
Or they'll release us yet another microtransition for Xbox Live Arcade, I bet.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.960
And honestly, the Well mode doesn't sound that interesting.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.960
Sequencer mode sounds okay.

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.960
I'd like it better if you could use your own songs.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.960
Maybe. Someday. Maybe. Who knows.

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.960
All right, well every week here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.960
we allow you guys to interact with us, not just through the chat room and the phone calls,

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:31.960
but your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.960
And every week DarkSakura digs into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite emails

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.960
and reads them for you live here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.960
I'm sure the email's been collecting as we were away at PAX.

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:41.960
Kind of.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.960
So let's get to it. I don't know if she has time to read them all,

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.960
but she'll at least do some of her favorites tonight.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.960
Well, I can read most of them.

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:53.960
Um, hey O.L.R., ever since 2006 I was very excited for the Wii since it came out.

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:57.960
I purchased one early 2007. I had to work to pay it off all summer.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:02.960
I bought all the big Nintendo titles and played each of them for about 20 hours until I got stuck.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:05.960
Then I got an Xbox 360. They're incomparable.

01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:09.960
The Xbox 360 has good online experience and great high-definition graphics.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.960
After watching Nintendo's press conference, I have completely lost hope.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.960
Obviously Nintendo doesn't need to do anything for us.

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.960
Long story short, my Wii is ending today on eBay,

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:24.960
and I'm hoping to get a lot from it seeing as how it still is in demand.

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:30.960
Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.960
Love your show. Keep it up.

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.960
By the way, my name is Dan, and my gamer tag is DanTheThird.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.960
Okay, you have a good name.

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.960
That's up to you. I'm not getting rid of my Wii.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.960
I still have stuff on that that I like to play.

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.960
Stuff on 360 I like to play.

01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.960
It just really depends on what type of things that you like.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.960
I mean, there's stuff on PS3 that I like to play.

01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.960
You know, it's been a little while since we've reiterated the golden rule of gaming for our listeners,

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:01.960
so why don't we remind the listeners of what the golden rule of gaming is?

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.960
The Wii system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.960
So in other words, if there's a game that looks to be coming out in the Wii's future that you want to play,

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.960
keep in mind that the Wii is the only place you're going to be able to play it, probably.

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.960
Granted, there are some games that get ported everywhere, like Rock Band,

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.960
but a lot of times on the Wii, that's the only place you can play it.

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.960
So if it's going to have the game you want, you've got to hang on to that Wii.

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:24.960
As much as I've been kind of knocking the game a little bit,

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.960
thinking it could be stale like the other ones,

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.960
I have high hopes for Animal Crossing,

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.960
because I want to try it out, because it might actually be pretty cool with the internet-in-the-room-speak thing.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.960
We'll see. Time will tell.

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.960
But I wouldn't know if I sold my Wii back in a panic,

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.960
and they might be even harder to get when you want them again,

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:45.960
or you might think you make a profit off it now, but it's a risky game.

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.960
It's a risky game to play.

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.960
But at the same time, if you're not enjoying your Wii and you're never playing your Wii

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:53.960
and you don't think there's anything in the future, then sell it.

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.960
Some other family probably really wants it. Why not make some money off it?

01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.960
But realize, I've seen people do this.

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.960
I've even seen a good friend of mine do this, where he'll get a system, sell it back,

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.960
buy the same system six months later, sell it back, buy it again.

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.960
And I'm just kind of like, what are you thinking? You're losing so much money doing that.

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:14.960
If you think something's going to come out on it that you want to play in the future, hang on to it.

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:17.960
You'll save money in the long run.

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.960
Next you up, and this is regarding Evangelion, actually.

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:23.960
Hi, I have a friend that is obsessed with Evangelion,

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.960
and I was wondering if there were any good games from that series.

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:29.960
The answer is no, unless you like playing the dating sim kind,

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:33.960
and then I've got, there was, you know, the Saturn ones that came out.

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.960
I think there was one on Nintendo 64, and there most recently came out one,

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:42.960
I want to say on PS2, was it?

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.960
I don't seek out these games.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.960
They're still making Eva games, so just look online.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.960
The Pachinko game's the best one. Go for that.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.960
Anyway, he says he is learning Japanese, so importing is not a problem.

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.960
Okay. If it has that crazy intro theme from the anime, it gets bonus points.

01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:58.960
Sure, they all do.

01:36:58.960 --> 01:36:59.960
They all do.

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:05.960
In fact, I can tell you from experience that at least one of the Saturn ones has a full opening,

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:06.960
like it was an episode.

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:10.960
It's set up like an episode, basically.

01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:14.960
I would make him ask for himself, but I'm still working on converting him to OLR goodness.

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:16.960
You guys and Gal are great.

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:20.960
Your funny kicks my brain, and I enjoy it every week via podcast.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.960
Someday I will listen live. That is not a threat. It's a promise.

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:26.960
PS, Dark Sakura, why do you hate Ayanami?

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.960
Because she's boring and has the personality of a bed sheet, and Asuka could kick her ass.

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.960
I have no idea what you're talking about, but it's funny.

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:37.960
She's a clone girl with no personality.

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.960
PPS, I hope I avoided the grammar attack. That was scary.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:47.960
Well...

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.960
Let me distract the grammar Nazi, Dark Sakura, with some chat comments.

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:56.960
The last email generated a lot of chat comments talking about the kids wanting to sell back his Wii.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.960
Skylark in chat says, fuck my Wii.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.960
I haven't played it in four months. Can't sell it, though.

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:07.960
Spent $300 on Virtual Console.

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.960
Then again, I've probably sold quite a bit, or I've probably bought a lot on that, too.

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.960
Skylark also continues to say, only good for a party environment.

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:19.960
TheRobD says, some other family wants it. Think of the children. Sell your Wii.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:22.960
Is anyone thinking of the children?

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.960
ActDeaf would like to point out that bed sheets are warm and sometimes comfy.

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:28.960
That's only when worn by other bodies.

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.960
Okay, she has the personality of a...

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:34.960
Of a gnat.

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.960
No, of a stalactite.

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:39.960
Because she's kind of a drip.

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:40.960
Alright, move on.

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:42.960
How's that?

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.960
Okay, moving forward.

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:48.960
There's actually a little bit more. He signed it.

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:54.960
By Zanovore, yes I eat aliens, munch munch crunch crunch slurp gulp happy.

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.960
Thank you. At least it's not an Olive Garden reference.

01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.960
TheRobD is referencing Pax, saying, I must say the Dark Sakura was cool to meet in person,

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:08.960
but after finding out how much she likes Gachamon and hates Rayonami,

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.960
he says, Dark Sakura plus plus.

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:11.960
Oh, thank you.

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.960
Next email.

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:18.960
I think it's time to check how the Eye of Judgment is doing in sales, don't you?

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:22.960
I listened to you guys to put me to sleep.

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.960
No, no, you're not that boring.

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.960
Hey, wait a minute.

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.960
Let me finish. No, you're not that boring. It's just more entertaining than music.

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:31.960
And I have not heard anything on the Eye of Judgment.

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.960
Is it just me or did you forget?

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.960
Sincerely is Richard, AKA the Doctor, AKA XGC the Doctor, AKA that one guy.

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:44.960
Okay. Look, it's not going to sell a million.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.960
I hate to break it to you, but I will look up the numbers right now.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.960
Well, Dark Sakura reads the next email.

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:52.960
Hey, OLR. Tae Ban here from Kenya.

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:56.960
I haven't been able to take a picture of Samara's cafe yet, but the pic is coming.

01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:02.960
I finally bought a Nintendo DS, so I'm looking for some recommendations on some RPGs I should import for the system.

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:05.960
Sorry for the shortness of my email, but I'm typing this out on my iPhone.

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.960
Thanks for the read on your show. Tae Ban... I can't pronounce it right.

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:12.960
Yeah, how are those iPhone sales doing in Kenya?

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.960
They're all over the place.

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.960
This message is brought to you by Kenya, home of the never-ending mud walls.

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.960
P.S. this isn't my email address. I was banned from Gmail.

01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:25.960
You can't get banned from Gmail. The guy is following me on Twitter. It's a lie.

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.960
Admit why you are lying. Why do you do this?

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.960
I just think it's funny.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.960
I know, I know.

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.960
The world ends with you.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:40.960
Eye of Judgement, 220,000.22 million. So you're just over one fifth of the way there.

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:42.960
Final Fantasy VI.

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.960
And then watch out for the Kenyans because they run really fast according to that one commercial.

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.960
Okay, next email.

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.960
How goes it? It goes.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.960
So yeah, I tried to make some sense when typing, but I'm horrid with punctuation and grammar in general.

01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:00.960
It's not something... This is the one that I sort of savaged before.

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:07.960
It's not something I really picked up on and was in trouble a lot as a kid when you were supposed to learn all that stuff.

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:12.960
Well, that being said, it's me, Glider, aka the 56k-er. Just had a few things to mention.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:18.960
A little bit pissed about digital life this year. I've been going for the past few years, gonna miss it this year, but oh well.

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:24.960
Speaking of Jet Set Radio, one of my personal faves, another unusual skating game that was on PlayStation 2, Yaya Caballista.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:31.960
Okay, City Skater. I played the crap out of it and was good very close to Jet Set Radio.

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:34.960
It could use a little skateboard that you put on the analog stick and held the controller sideways.

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.960
Very painful on the thumbs, but nonetheless fun.

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.960
I'm really good at reading run-in sentences, aren't I?

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.960
Dot dot dot dot dot dot dot. Oh yes, I remember what else I was going to say. Rob!

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.960
He put it all in caps, so I had to say it that way.

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:58.960
I heard you crack the dial-up joke. 56k-er has been my handle for almost 15 years now, so I'm not giving it up, even though I do have high-speed broadband.

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:05.960
20 megabytes down and 8 megabytes up. It's about avga these days. It's average these days.

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:13.960
But real quick, I did used to use Shotgun to 56k modems, sync them and dial out to different services with the same login.

01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:17.960
But it's also a good way to blow out your mobile modems.

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.960
Look, at least you're not the 300-botter.

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:27.960
Because when I was on the Commodore 64 back in the day calling BBS's, 300-bod, yo. 300-bod.

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:33.960
Anyway, keep up the good work, catch you guys later. P.S. Jamie, I'm really trying to have better grammar and punctuation. Please, please don't eat me.

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:41.960
You know what? Just remember that when your sentence ends, use a period.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:48.960
Or if you're excited, use an exclamation point. Or if you're asking a question, you use a question mark.

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:52.960
And then when you start your new sentence, you use the big letters.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.960
By the way, that 300-bod modem about the size of a Neo Geo cartridge. No joke.

01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:57.960
God, really? I know.

01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.960
Next email. We have three left.

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:00.960
Hello, this is...

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:01.960
Three?

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.960
You know what?

01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.960
What? Oh, it's fine. We don't have a lot of stories left, so this fills time.

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:15.960
This is Blade 3. I just want to say I'm a long time listener and I've never called in, but I'm going to try this weekend. Yes, please do.

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:20.960
Also wanted to ask your opinion about Counter Strike Source and Knights of the Old Republic. KOTOR!

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.960
If you've played them. Sorry about my bad grammar, I'm using my PSP. That's okay, yours are still better than the last email.

01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.960
I also wanted to tell Loki that I'm very impressed with the PSP OLR site. It is so good.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:35.960
On that note, I would like to ask his permission to use the source code for my own PSP site.

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.960
The name and images and links and stuff would be different, but I'm having trouble with formatting, so it would be handy.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.960
Thanks, good show as always. Keep it up.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:47.960
P.S. My site would be primarily used for PSP downloads such as videos, wallpapers, and demos directly to the PSP.

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:51.960
Well, Loki is not here to answer that question, so you'll have to ask him later.

01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:55.960
Yeah, and he left chat. You can always email him, though. He likes getting emails. Loki at Orange House...

01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:56.960
He loves email.

01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:57.960
He loves email.

01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:58.960
A lot of them.

01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.960
Yeah.

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:00.960
Especially email about My Little Pony.

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:03.960
Uh-huh, and if you sign him up for Porn Mail List, he'll love that.

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.960
Oh, he loves it so much. It's so much fun.

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:11.960
Actually, we shouldn't be encouraging folks to do that, because our website administrator probably would frown on that, so yeah, don't actually do that.

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:12.960
He would send us big frowny faces.

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:19.960
Actually, as far as KOTOR, I'm sorry, I had a friend who used to playtest that, and I got too used to hearing her calling it Scrotor,

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:26.960
so I have no ideas about the name, except I've been watching UdonKru's art that they've been putting up on DeviantArt, and it looks pretty cool.

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:31.960
Well, when I have no opinion on the game, I mean, KOTOR's okay from what I've seen of it. What was the other one, Counter Strike?

01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:32.960
Counter Strike Source.

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:37.960
Not my type of game, but Loki's. See, it's the one where Loki wasn't here, because he really plays that.

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:40.960
But when I don't really play the game, I turn to chat, and the Rob D says,

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:46.960
Source was just fun, KOTOR was revolutionary for Star Wars games, and revitalized them for a little while.

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.960
There you have it.

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:55.960
I just kept hearing about, this game is buggy, I hate this glitch, because my friend knew.

01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:01.960
Hey guys, I would like to comment on a story topic you folks talked about on your last show.

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:04.960
I would have called in them, but your 800 number was down at the time.

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:12.960
In regards to the story about the We Wooked reworked Space Invaders game that was done for art slash commentary purposes,

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.960
I feel pretty much as Jamie does, I know, because I'm right all the time.

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:20.960
I would just like to add my own two cents in the form of two rhetorical questions.

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:24.960
You know how the First Amendment to our Bill of Rights guarantees us the right to free speech?

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.960
Well, what amendment guarantees the right to not be offended? Oh yeah, there isn't one.

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:34.960
Honestly, the whiny little fucker that was pissing and moaning about this issue really needs to get a grip.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:41.960
Not only that, but if I was in the guy's shoes and the guys that did the exhibit, I probably would not have only kept the exhibit up.

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.960
I would have most likely cobbled together some of them together as a response to the whining.

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:50.960
I don't know, something along the lines of the player actually bringing the terrorists flying planes into twin towers,

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:54.960
but change the plane into a flying pair of boobs or some phallic symbol instead of a plane.

01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.960
Some of y'all are just vindictive like that.

01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.960
I know, it's great.

01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:04.960
Plus add a severed head, rampant cursing, a straight couple having sex, and two men kissing.

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.960
All of this would be a roundabout way of saying fuck you to the whiners.

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:10.960
One more thing that relates to this that I just remembered.

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:20.960
The original intention of free speech in the First Amendment was to protect the voiced opinions of those who are in a minority in a given issue.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:27.960
No, I don't mean like race or anything, but I mean like those people who have unpopular views like the KKK, people who think bin Laden is cool, etc.

01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:30.960
Face it, not everyone has the same views slash opinions, etc.

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.960
Thanks for reading this. Have a good one.

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:35.960
Honestly, that's perfectly right.

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:46.960
Everybody, no matter how offensive or distasteful their opinions are, as long as they are a citizen or at least legally living within this country,

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:55.960
they do have a right to voice that opinion as long as they do so in an appropriate way.

01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:01.960
You know what I mean? Like you can't, there are some places, especially private ground, where people are not going to allow some people to say things,

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:08.960
and that's, you know, a private organization may not let somebody from an outside source say something on their property,

01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:15.960
but in the United States, we do have freedom of speech, even if it is unpopular and people are wrong.

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.960
Everyone's got a right to an opinion.

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:21.960
I had to really think for a minute what that email was even about because it's been so long.

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:25.960
You know, like two weeks ever since spending arcade expo.

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.960
By the way, speaking of the last email, because chat's a little bit behind,

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:38.960
Loki actually popped in chat to respond to the last email because he says, sorry, I'm not in chat, but I'm listening to the stream.

01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:42.960
And he says in response to the last email, sorry, I'm not giving out the source code for the site.

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.960
But, you know, he did work really hard on it. He did earn it.

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.960
But I do want to say this. Maybe if you could get Loki that chat thing he's been looking for, that other guy won't give up.

01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.960
Maybe he'll make a trade. Maybe. I'm just hypothesizing.

01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:56.960
Loki does go on to say, I've never played Counter Strike.

01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:00.960
And no prawn email, please. I get enough spam in my OLR email.

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:03.960
He's lying. He loves the porn. Just kidding.

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:04.960
Last email?

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.960
It's true. We all get a lot of spam in our Orange Launch Radio boxes.

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:08.960
That's why I deleted mine.

01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:09.960
Jerks.

01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.960
All right. Yeah. This. Last email, please.

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:17.960
Okay. Hey, guys. I would like to comment on a story slash topic you folks have talked about on your last show.

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:18.960
I would have...

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:19.960
No. No comment.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.960
Duh.

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:21.960
I just read this one.

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:22.960
Did you? Oh.

01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:23.960
Yeah.

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.960
Hey, OLR. Are you having a super special awesome Sunday?

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:28.960
Cookies for those who know the reference.

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:34.960
So, anyways, I was downloading some old podcasts from the OLR archive when you guys were away for a week.

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:39.960
And I can safely say that you have been a really great podcast throughout the years.

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:44.960
It was funny comparing your old expectations from the next gen consoles to your usual and your usual antics.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:50.960
By the way, DMN Elibits is not a Katamari killer minus two... minus... oh, that's episode 200. Sorry.

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.960
To finish, I was at Blockbuster today and saw copies of DDRX and DDR Hottest Party 2 bundles.

01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:01.960
Since the release date is September 16th for both games, can retail stores sell the games beforehand?

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:02.960
Not technically.

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:04.960
Or does it really apply to street dates?

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:08.960
I was mulling over this when DDR Supernova came out earlier two years ago.

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.960
Anyway, great job at PAX, and here's to another great episode.

01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.960
This is from Katamari's Forever.

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.960
Sometimes, too, the bundles and the game by itself come out at different times.

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:20.960
That's something really important to keep in mind. That's what's going to be happening with Rock Band 2.

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.960
Rock Band 2 is coming out as a standalone game on the 360 for about a month until you start seeing the bundles hit streets.

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:29.960
So always keep that in mind when you see those types of things out in the wild, too.

01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:36.960
P.S. It's my birthday at the time of reading this, September 7th, so it would really make my day if you read this, thank you.

01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:37.960
Happy birthday!

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:40.960
Happy damn birthday! Cha-cha-cha.

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:46.960
And in closing, if a Yaris crashes in the middle of nowhere and no one hears it, does the crappy game still exist?

01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.960
Sadly, yes.

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:50.960
You know, I'm actually thinking of getting a Yaris. I'm going to be buying a new car for Christmas.

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:56.960
That's going to be my Christmas present to myself, I've decided, because my previous Toyota I've had since 2001.

01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.960
And it's 98, so it officially turned 10 years old this year.

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:00.960
It's been abused.

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:05.960
It's done. It's time to put a gunshot in it and lay it down for a little while.

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:08.960
I'm actually thinking about a Yaris. I love Toyotas.

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:13.960
If Rob gets one, that means if he gives us a ride somewhere, we can just say we're taking a ride in this crappy game.

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:18.960
Yep. Bring all the jokes on that you want. I'm really, really considering it.

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:20.960
Heart! Done!

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:22.960
Alright, no more emails.

01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:26.960
Mailbag at OrangeLauncherDude.com if you want to get him for next week.

01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:30.960
And yes, open the floodgates of Chatroom. Not going to be for wanting to get a Yaris.

01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:33.960
Even if there were more emails? I'm not reading them!

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:39.960
You know, I could say I'm coming on here and getting any car and somebody would taunt me for my choice.

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:40.960
Get a Lancer.

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.960
I'm just going to have to do my own research. No.

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:43.960
Get a Lancer.

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:44.960
No.

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:45.960
Lancer.

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:46.960
No.

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:47.960
Lancer's the best cars ever.

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:48.960
Lies.

01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:49.960
Truth.

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:52.960
Alright, this is going to be the best game ever.

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.960
It's on the Nintendo DS. It's from Ubisoft, so you already know this is a winner.

01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:59.960
And Cesar Millan, do you know what he does?

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.960
He talks to dogs.

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:04.960
Yes, he's the dog whisperer.

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:07.960
See, either you knew that because you actually know it, in which case I'm going to make fun of you.

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:10.960
Or you knew that because you looked over here at my screen, in which case I'm going to pitch you.

01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:11.960
Or at Red Show Roll.

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:12.960
Oh, okay.

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:15.960
Well, that's what he does. He's the dog whisperer.

01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:18.960
You know, like the horse whisperer, but with dogs.

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.960
And yes, they're making a game out of it.

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:26.960
I'm leaving that pause for you to contemplate what this means for gaming.

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.960
Nintendogs it ain't, that's for sure.

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.960
It is actually a TV show on National Geographic Channel.

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:37.960
It was rated by the ESRB, and then it kind of slipped away for a little while.

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:39.960
Well, now there's box art. It is really happening.

01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:41.960
And a PC version.

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:46.960
No idea what exactly you do in this game, but damn if you...

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:52.960
I mean, I know they say don't judge a game by its cover, but for real, how can I not?

01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:56.960
It's a freaking dog whisperer game.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.960
Please.

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:00.960
This game has been judged.

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.960
Gong.

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:03.960
There you have it.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:05.960
The end, dog whisperer.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:08.960
Game Guru says, sounds like another crappy Ubisoft game.

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:09.960
That's what most people are saying, actually.

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:10.960
Sounds like dog poo.

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:12.960
Yeah, the dog pooper.

01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:14.960
Poobysoft, says Frisbee.

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:15.960
I like that.

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:20.960
That should be their new name, Poobysoft, whenever they have a crappy game we're talking about on the show.

01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:21.960
I like that.

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:23.960
Don't forget that Poobysoft.

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:29.960
Loki's in chat and says it's not as bad as travel games for dummies on the DS and the My Stop Smoking coach.

01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:34.960
I want to say we talked about that My Stop Smoking coach a few weeks ago when it was first announced.

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.960
That isn't nearly as bad as the freaking dog whisperer.

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:41.960
I see a lot of potential for My Stop Smoking, but dog whisperer?

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.960
Really?

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.960
Really?

01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:47.960
Really?

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.960
Dog whisperer.

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:51.960
How?

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:54.960
Pluckyguy wants to see a Dog the Bounty Hunter game.

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:58.960
I don't know about that. He's a controversial individual. I don't know if you've heard the stories.

01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:01.960
Alright, new story, new story.

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:04.960
Next story has to do with Space Invaders!

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:06.960
The keyboard.

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:10.960
They have made a Space Invaders keyboard.

01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:19.960
And it has little letters on top of the little aliens on the keys and you really can't see them that well unless you're staring at them.

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:22.960
And then it has the shooty thing on the space bar.

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:28.960
It's a Space Invaders keyboard for PC.

01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:33.960
I don't know what else I can say about this. It's a Space Invaders keyboard.

01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:41.960
Look at the bright side. At least this time, unlike the last time we discussed Space Invaders on this show, there's no 9-11 references on this keyboard, correct?

01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:45.960
I just put a picture of it in the chatroom. It's a Space Invaders keyboard.

01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:48.960
Is the keyboard 9-11 reference free?

01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.960
Yeah, but it's a Space Invaders keyboard.

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:53.960
That should be a sticker they put on the box.

01:53:53.960 --> 01:54:01.960
You know what I'm going to do when my keyboard dies, especially after I punch it in the face, well, if it had a face, for the stupid fucking drivers not working?

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:03.960
Thank God I'm moving to Linux.

01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:06.960
I'm going to repaint it.

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:09.960
Just for fun?

01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:11.960
I'm going to paint a big Pac-Man on it.

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:13.960
You should paint fire on it.

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:15.960
I'm going to paint Pac-Man on it, even dots.

01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:16.960
Paint Pac-Man on fire.

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:18.960
Paint your butt on fire.

01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:21.960
What? I didn't eat Chipotle today.

01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:29.960
Oh God, you know this show's hit rock bottom when we start making poopy jokes.

01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:31.960
Anyhow.

01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:32.960
Dart making?

01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:37.960
By the way, what a great lead-in to our next story, speaking of a lowest common denominator jokes.

01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:40.960
I was going to say speaking of flaming butt.

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:48.960
Every time the lowest common denominator gets brought up, especially in games, you can't help but reference the game Choeniki.

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:54.960
And if you don't know why Choeniki, just Google it. Just Google it and you'll see why.

01:54:54.960 --> 01:55:00.960
Here's the thing. Choeniki is, this might come as a shock to you, the game is out on Virtual Console in Japan.

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.960
It actually came out in Europe as well.

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:04.960
Here's the thing.

01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:10.960
It's been rated by the ESRB.

01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:12.960
That would be the American board.

01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:16.960
They rated it E10 for mild suggestive themes.

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.960
No, here's the other thing.

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:21.960
It's been dated for Monday.

01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:23.960
I'm downloading Choeniki.

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:32.960
By the time you hear this episode, if this story isn't bullshit, which when the ESRB is involved in, you may be able to play Choeniki on Virtual Console in America.

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.960
The unthinkable has happened.

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:37.960
Jamie has been so excited she dropped her mic.

01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:42.960
I'm happy. Choeniki is so much fun.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.960
I think it's kind of gay, actually.

01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:48.960
It is very, very, very gay.

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.960
But in a good way.

01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:54.960
If you actually go and say, this game is gay, I'm actually going to agree with you.

01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:56.960
I'm going to be like, yep, it is gay.

01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:07.960
This game totally does it with other games of the same gender.

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.960
Frisbee says it is on the Nintendo website.

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:12.960
It's happening.

01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:17.960
And by the way, as if you care, Final Soldier is also supposed to come out tomorrow.

01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:20.960
Seriously, everything sucks compared to Choeniki.

01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:24.960
By the way, since we weren't here last week, we might want to mention some other games hit Virtual Console.

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:29.960
Clu Clu Land, if you like strange floating objects with hooks trying to reveal coins.

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:33.960
I actually played this game a lot in Animal Crossing, because it was one of the games you could get in your house.

01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:36.960
And then this little game, I don't know if you've heard of it.

01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:38.960
Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:39.960
You ever heard of that game?

01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:40.960
Sweet!

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:44.960
I think I read an article on it once in Nintendo Power, like in the back of the magazine.

01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:46.960
It is available now on Virtual Console.

01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.960
And boy was that a quiet release.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:51.960
It just came out on Labor Day while everyone was out of town.

01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:53.960
You know what I mean?

01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:58.960
It's kind of a little stealth release there, but I know a lot of people have been waiting for that in all seriousness.

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:02.960
Legend of the Seven Stars, finally available on the Virtual Console for download.

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:06.960
And as Loki in chat says, and I'm sure he would say if he were here in studio right now,

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.960
Motherfucking Super Mario RPG!

01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.960
Word, Loki. Word.

01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:17.960
So, to continue on.

01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:19.960
Yes, more- Choaniki 2?

01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:20.960
No!

01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:21.960
Well, Tipo does want to point out-

01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:22.960
Sheet music!

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:27.960
The first Choaniki game is the tamest in the series, and it is the first game.

01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:28.960
Sheet music, Rob. Sheet music.

01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:30.960
Yes, sheet music. What the sheet?

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.960
Uh-huh-huh.

01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:39.960
Well, it's sheet music that is titled Killer Instinct 3 Main Title.

01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:47.960
It could be a fake, it could be photoshoppity, but it's been found somewhere.

01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:52.960
And it says, uh, a Killer Instinct 3-

01:57:52.960 --> 01:58:00.960
And by the way, if anyone wants to hop out their MIDI recorder, it actually looks fairly complex, and I can't play that high, so whatever.

01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:02.960
I'm surprised nobody's tried to turn it into a MIDI file yet.

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:06.960
But here's the thing, what if it's just printed out from Cakewalk?

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:10.960
Like, it's not that hard to make a fake song and print it out with a fake title.

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:11.960
Probably.

01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.960
I just, I don't know, I think it's, my BS meter is going off the charts on this.

01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:18.960
But you remember the Christmas card thing that Rare did before?

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:19.960
Uh-huh.

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:21.960
With the KI3 Christmas card?

01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:22.960
Mm-hmm.

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:33.960
Well, there was that, now we have this music, and now there were other rumors that were floating around, like there was the Fulgore picture, remember?

01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:34.960
Yeah.

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.960
So, it could happen.

01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:38.960
And it could not.

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:39.960
I liked Killer Instinct.

01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.960
Me too, don't get me wrong, but I don't know.

01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:45.960
You know, that would be a hell of an announcement, maybe in 2009, we'll see.

01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:47.960
But I don't know, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:57.960
I would love nothing more than this, but I can't help but feel like this is a fake, and we're all getting our legs pulled on this one, and I don't like being fooled.

01:58:57.960 --> 01:58:58.960
Are we being kill rolled?

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:01.960
Yes, we're being kill rolled, and I don't like being lied to.

01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:05.960
And when I feel like I'm being lied to, whether I'm being lied to or not, I get kind of angsty.

01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:08.960
And when I get angsty, the FUs of the week happen.

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:30.960
My FU of the week goes to the man with the small penis driving the truck that uses too much gas at the shopping center where I got my Starbucks from.

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:33.960
Stop doing cocaine!

01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:39.960
Stop doing cocaine!

01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.960
I don't know how much I should say.

01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:47.960
My FU of the week goes to a particular individual I'm thinking of.

01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:51.960
No, I don't want to say it, because if you give it attention, it only grows.

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:59.960
A particular individual I'm thinking of that really, really needs to stop stalking me.

01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:04.960
And this isn't a joke. It's not an OLR listener thing. It's something going on in my real life.

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:12.960
I honestly feel like I'm being stalked by a certain individual that needs to cut the shit out and just move on with themselves, because it's so frustrating.

02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:21.960
Stop being immature. Grow up. Grow up. Grow up!

02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:23.960
That's it.

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.960
I guess that's it, huh?

02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.960
Yeah, there's no one else here. Just you and me.

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.960
Well, I'm sure that...

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.960
Well, then I guess I'll do another story, huh?

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:32.960
I was going to say so.

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:41.960
All right. Xbox Live. Hey, if I want to take my aggressions out on something, I could punch people, and I will be able to do that in King of Fighters 98.

02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:44.960
This game is going to Xbox Live Arcade. You know, Fatal Fury...

02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.960
I have several versions of that game.

02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:56.960
Fatal Fury Special was on Xbox Live Arcade. I don't know if you all remember, but I guess it did well enough that Neo Geo and SNK, they're going to try it again with King of Fighters 98 going to Xbox Live Arcade.

02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:04.960
It is coming out. It's been re-released on the PlayStation 2 already. There were some extra features, like character balancing, and some new fighters on it.

02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:06.960
Hopefully the Xbox Live version will have all of this, too.

02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:12.960
There is no word of a release date yet, but sometime soon.

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:20.960
Probably before the end of the year, I'd imagine. King of Fighters 98 on Virtual Console. I might have to check that out. We'll see.

02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:31.960
Well, in other news, and this makes me specifically happy, and this is what actually brought it to my attention, is that one of my Live Journal friends linked the trailer for Dissidia Final Fantasy.

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:46.960
There's a YouTube video up, but basically it's a dramatic progressive action that's supposed to be like a fighting game with an RPG element, I think.

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.960
But you move through a field map, and then you have to fight different people.

02:01:50.960 --> 02:02:02.960
It's sort of actually, some of the fighting sequences are actually a lot like what was in Kingdom Hearts 2, where you run up walls and do all kinds of special stuff and earn points.

02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:08.960
But the cool thing about this is actually who the characters in the games are.

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:18.960
Actually, you've got your villains and your heroes. You've got the Warrior of Light from Final Fantasy versus Garland. You have Frienel from Final Fantasy 2, Onion Knight.

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:36.960
They've shown Squall and Zidane and Tidus. There's also, for some of the villains, there was the Emperor from Final Fantasy 2, Cloud of Darkness, Golbez, Exdeath, Kefka, Sephiroth, Ultimecia, Kuja, and Jecht from the other ones.

02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:47.960
I'm sure there's going to be more people from the other Final Fantasy games, some of the heroes coming into it, but I think that's going to be pretty cool. I'm looking forward to it.

02:02:47.960 --> 02:03:00.960
I have to say, my inner fanboy is very pleased. This game's been a little bit off the radar, but it looks hot. I really want to check this out when it comes out, and I hate admitting that. You know what I mean? But this game looks awesome.

02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:08.960
It's supposed to be all the major heroes versus the major villains. It has freaking Garland in it. That's awesome.

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:17.960
Nomura is doing the character designs, but trying to keep some of Amano's style to it, at least since some of the characters are.

02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:31.960
But they also said they used Jecht instead of Seymour for the Final Fantasy X references so they didn't have to put Yuna in it. I don't know.

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:37.960
Well, there'd be too many people that would get too big of a thrill out of punching Yuna in the face, sadly. Sorry, Yuna fans.

02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:43.960
And they said that it's actually supposed to have twice as much dialogue as Crisis Core.

02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:47.960
Dang. All right. This could be fun. We'll see.

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.960
I'm hoping so.

02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:58.960
All right. Well, another game that could be fun, Warhammer Online. As you noticed, if you're listening to part A, I had some fairly favorable things to say about the game during my little review of it.

02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.960
I played it at Penny Arcade Expo, and a lot of you have been getting the chance to check this out, too.

02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:13.960
The open beta launched this weekend playing Warhammer Online. The beta launched earlier this morning. Now, of course, it hasn't gone without some flaws.

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:19.960
Apparently, some of the folks outside the United States are having a heck of a time trying to get a Warhammer Online, and they're not happy.

02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:26.960
And also, apparently, some problems with the server even here in the US. Some folks are having problems getting in, but that's what happens when thousands of people hit this.

02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:34.960
That's what a beta is for. It is a test process. And AK Ripper is in chat, and I even heard him on Bobby just before we went live. He was complaining about this.

02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:39.960
And he's in there right now saying, not working. So, yeah, it looks like there's a lot of problems with it.

02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:44.960
But in theory, the beta is open, but it's probably just going to take a couple days for it to be ironed out.

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:53.960
But you know what? Let's look at the long-term thing. It's better this happened now than the day the game is actually supposed to come out and be on shelves and be out there for everybody, right?

02:04:53.960 --> 02:05:01.960
Is it just me? I don't know. I'd rather this happen now. But of course, then again, if I were one of these people trying to work my butt off to get in, I would probably also be pretty pissed.

02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:08.960
Especially if I just happen to be outside the United States. That's never cool to get the shaft because of where you live.

02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:14.960
But in theory, it's up. Hopefully, it'll get ironed out in the next couple days. We'll see.

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:24.960
Skype line will be open very soon at www.orangelaunchradio.com. Click on interact with us. Our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio or 1-877-GAMO-LR in the US and Canada.

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:36.960
For people who are interested in Call of Duty 5, at least as far as our European listeners, the World at War multiplayer beta will be out for PC and Xbox 360 in October.

02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:43.960
The PS3 one has not yet been announced. There's a chance it may not happen and nothing about Wii.

02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:52.960
So, it will be... they say the boot camp will open its doors and they haven't named a date yet.

02:05:52.960 --> 02:06:01.960
But the speculation, though, would be November 14th for the actual release date.

02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:08.960
So, they're thinking that it would probably correspond with the US one.

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:17.960
At any rate, you'll be able to use the squad system, be able to try some of the other new modes in it, the multiplayer mode.

02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:28.960
So, it'll be pretty cool and I'd like to see what people think about it. Call of Duty 4 was really freaking cool, so I have high expectations for Call of Duty 5.

02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:41.960
Alright, well hopefully Call of Duty 5 does not disappoint. Well, that's just about all the video game news we have tonight, but there is one more story about something kind of related to video game and it's something I actually checked out this week.

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:50.960
A new site launched. Now, you know, you've got your MySpace, you've got your Facebook, you've got your Twitter, of which, by the way, Orange Launch Radio is on all of those, your live journals and so on.

02:06:50.960 --> 02:07:00.960
And I'm sure you're thinking, damn, I need another social networking site. Well, another one has launched. It's called Raptor, R-A-P-T-R.

02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:06.960
Notice there's no O in that. It's just R-A-P-T-R is a new social gaming network site.

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:13.960
Here's how it works is basically you punch in all the various codes you have, your Wii code, your Xbox code, your Guitar Hero code.

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:25.960
You can also download an optional PC client. And basically what it does is the service kind of watches you on all of these various sites and it tracks all of your gaming progress, so to speak, on one site.

02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:33.960
Also, it'll let your friends know when you're online and playing games. So if you're actually using the free PC client, like folks can see when I'm playing World of Warcraft.

02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:42.960
So if you're kind of one of those people that always has a hard time, you know, finding friends to play online games with or whatever, whenever they're online, Raptor could be an option.

02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:49.960
I definitely want to know more about this site. I'm going to try and get the folks to come on the show, the folks behind Raptor, so we'll see what happens in the upcoming weeks.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:56.960
But yeah, if you want to check it out, the beta is now open, but it is still a beta, so you know it might break, but it's raptor.com.

02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:05.960
But be careful because sometimes they ask for your Twitter address and stuff. If you put that info in there, it's going to post on Twitter every time you go in to launch a game, and I think that could get very annoying.

02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:12.960
So I did not link it to my Twitter for that reason. So be careful when you think about those things because these sites really try to get you to link to everything.

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:20.960
And you know, they're just trying to hoard out to as many people as possible so that they can get their numbers up and to possibly sell ads or whatever they're going to do in the future.

02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:28.960
But it could be interesting. So we'll see, we'll see. I really would like to get them on the show and just ask them, you know, what's the point?

02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:33.960
And maybe they can justify it. I imagine there's got to be a reason to it. They've had a lot of money invested in it.

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:45.960
And I believe it's from one of the co-creators of... God, what was the other thing he made? I don't remember. Was it Steam? Don't quote me on that. Somebody in chat will probably remember.

02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:48.960
The guy made something else that was really big and popular.

02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:50.960
I don't remember off the top of my head.

02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:58.960
I don't remember either. But I signed up for it. If you want to send me a friend request, I guess so. Sky is just my name on there, just like Twitter, S-K-I-E.

02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:04.960
So there you go. Unless you're my stalker, then you can't add me. Sorry.

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:05.960
Well.

02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:08.960
Because I don't need that person finding me in Warcraft.

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:15.960
All right. Are there any last minute stories in the house tonight before we open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR?

02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:16.960
I have none.

02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:20.960
You have none. I think I might have one. I'll get to it in a little bit. But let's do some calls first.

02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:23.960
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:24.960
GS68 here.

02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:26.960
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:29.960
Last week, I got around to playing Street Fighter IV.

02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:31.960
And what did you think of Street Fighter IV?

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:36.960
Well, I didn't really play it much, so I don't know much about the game mechanics and stuff.

02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:46.960
But in the first thing, you see the graphics, and they're really nice. My complaint is that the male fighters look a little too muscular.

02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:52.960
Do the female fighters have too big of boobies? Like everything is really overemphasized or what?

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:53.960
I'm not sure.

02:09:53.960 --> 02:10:00.960
One thing I liked about the setup here at San Jose State was that they had two cabinets, and they're linked up, so that way...

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:07.960
Which is good because not only does each player have their own cabinet, like those Japanese cabinets, but...

02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:18.960
You can also play one-player mode if someone else is already playing in this mode called beginner mode, and it basically lets you go three rounds without anyone challenging you.

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:21.960
Which is nice because I suck at fighting games.

02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:27.960
Give us an idea, how big is this game? I mean, were there just tons and tons of people there to play?

02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:34.960
There's always people playing. Usually around four or five people, at the least.

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:39.960
Is this game really getting out there? I mean, I've been so distracted by all the other goings on in the PAX world and all that.

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:43.960
I haven't really been following, but I know it was really big when it got into a couple arcades.

02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:48.960
Is it slowly finding its way into more and more and more places where it's not too hard to find now?

02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:56.960
I'm not sure. I had to go down there, only until I went down there to discover that we finally have Street Fighter IV here in the Bay Area.

02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:07.960
I mean, as I've said before, the arcade scene is dying. I mean, new arcade games tend to catch the gaming community as a whole by surprise these days.

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:14.960
Whereas for games on PC and console, we know exactly when they come out, so there's no surprise to that.

02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.960
I do want to point out in chat, IkumaJP has some comments about the Street Fighter IV graphics.

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:22.960
Says, the muscle is good, and Chun-Li has an elephant leg.

02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:25.960
So her legs are even thicker than ever?

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:30.960
Chun-Li has amazing thighs. Sheik would put Mary Lou Rhett into shame.

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.960
There you go.

02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:34.960
Okay, I actually have the hentai of her.

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:38.960
GS68, any other thoughts on Street Fighter IV before we get to another call?

02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:45.960
Um, she has something else to say, but I forgot. Oh yeah, now that Super Mario RPG is out, I can't wait for all of you game fans to complain.

02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:48.960
Where's my Earthbound? Where's my Earthbound?

02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:50.960
I'll start. Where's my Earthbound?

02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:51.960
Oh.

02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:54.960
Alright, have a good one, GS68. Take care, buddy.

02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:55.960
You too.

02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:56.960
Bye.

02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:01.960
Pluckyguy in chat says, I kinda like Chun-Li's jungle booty.

02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:04.960
Nothing wrong with a big butt. 1877.

02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:06.960
Just rub like big butts and cannot lie.

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:08.960
You other brothers can't deny.

02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:10.960
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype.

02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:16.960
Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call here live on this Sunday evening, September the 7th of 2008.

02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:18.960
Let's go to the phones.

02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:20.960
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:24.960
Hello?

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:26.960
Hello, hi, who's this? You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:27.960
Hello, this is Seg.

02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:30.960
Hey, Seg, my friend. How are you?

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:32.960
I'm doing quite alright, and yourself?

02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:34.960
I am doing awesome.

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:35.960
Hello, I met you.

02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:36.960
Yep.

02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:37.960
Yep.

02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:39.960
Seg was one of my buddies. He lives in the Bay Area.

02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.960
The cupcake shop or store, right?

02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:44.960
Yes, he told the cupcake story, but nobody's gonna get that.

02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:47.960
He also wore the manly corset one day, which was great.

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:49.960
That was a fabulously manly corset.

02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:51.960
Definitely showed off your hourglass figure.

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:54.960
And only three jerks that day, too.

02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:01.960
I was quite surprised that there weren't as many jerks there.

02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:02.960
Welcomely surprised.

02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:05.960
You know, just be glad you weren't the guy in the Princess Peach outfit,

02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:07.960
because his picture got a lot of stuff.

02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:09.960
Okay, I have standards.

02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:11.960
I don't know. You know what? You've inspired me, Seg.

02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:14.960
Next year, I'm gonna push the cross-dressing envelope.

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:16.960
No, no, no. I wasn't cross-dressing.

02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:18.960
I know you weren't. I know you weren't, but I'm just saying.

02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:20.960
I'm just making sure for everyone else listening in.

02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:26.960
I want to incorporate a little more femininity into my outfits.

02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:30.960
I don't know. I just think you need to parade through the con as Frank.

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:33.960
Oh, should I bring my full Frank-N-Furter regalia next year?

02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:34.960
Bring it.

02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:35.960
If they'd let me in.

02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:37.960
And you also need the curly mullet wig.

02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:38.960
Forget it. I'm sorry.

02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:41.960
Seg probably had things he wanted to talk about that aren't corsets.

02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:43.960
What's on your mind, Seg?

02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:47.960
Well, it is in the similar vein of PAX.

02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:49.960
I couldn't really look up for any confirmation,

02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:54.960
but I heard talks that PAX is thinking about doing East Coast.

02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:00.960
But what I want to propose out to listeners and all that is,

02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:04.960
how do you think the whole convention dynamic would change

02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:11.960
with a major East Coast specific for video games conference?

02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:12.960
I do want to say this real quick.

02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:15.960
It has been confirmed by the Penny Arcade Expo organizers,

02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:16.960
Boston in 2010.

02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:18.960
They have already booked the venue, apparently.

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:20.960
Okay. I just wasn't 100%. I forgot where I read it.

02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:22.960
No, that's all right.

02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:24.960
Timing is everything, in my opinion.

02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:26.960
I think they can get away with doing two shows in a year

02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:28.960
if they're really well spaced out,

02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:31.960
especially if it's true that they're doing it in April,

02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:32.960
that's not a bad time to do it

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.960
because you have a lot of game releases.

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:35.960
When are most games released?

02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:37.960
They're released in the early summer,

02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:38.960
or they're released right before Christmas.

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:42.960
So if you have your early April show promoting those spring games,

02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.960
and you have the August show promoting the holiday games,

02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:47.960
which PAX is kind of doing,

02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:49.960
I think they can pull it off.

02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:53.960
I would be very curious to see, though, if it ends up kind of,

02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:56.960
if each con kind of eats each other,

02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:57.960
but maybe that's what they want.

02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:58.960
And when I say that, I mean, you know,

02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:00.960
is attendance going to go down at one

02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:02.960
because now they have this other one available,

02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:04.960
but maybe in a way that's what they want.

02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:07.960
Maybe that's how they're trying to control Seattle from getting too big.

02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:08.960
Go ahead.

02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:13.960
Well, to me, as someone who lived in the East Coast and the Midwest,

02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:17.960
I grew up in Michigan and also lived in Boston for a few years.

02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:22.960
There are comic conventions.

02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:27.960
There's conventions that add on video games,

02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:30.960
but it wasn't front and center.

02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:34.960
And everything else that really makes front and center for video games

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:37.960
is all pretty much predominantly on the West Coast.

02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:39.960
So I'm really interested to see.

02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:44.960
I personally think that if nothing else comes down,

02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:47.960
a large big name on the East Coast,

02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:51.960
that PAX really has a very interesting opportunity here

02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:57.960
to be something, to really fulfill a demand

02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:00.960
that hasn't been filled yet with East Coast

02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:02.960
because you've got all the people that wanted to go

02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:04.960
but couldn't make that big, huge stretch out there.

02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:06.960
Now it's a little bit more easier.

02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:08.960
It's like, oh, it's just a weekend instead of,

02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:13.960
or it's less than a day to get there versus a flight across the country.

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:15.960
There's a lot of people in chat saying that there's not enough game companies

02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:17.960
on the East Coast, but I kind of disagree.

02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:20.960
Harmonix, 2K.

02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:22.960
And don't forget the folks in Toronto.

02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:23.960
It's not that far away for them.

02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:26.960
It's closer for them to go there than to go to Seattle.

02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:28.960
So I don't know. I beg to differ.

02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:30.960
I think they could get a decent show out of it.

02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:33.960
And there will be those folks that travel.

02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:34.960
Why not?

02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:38.960
The Warhammer people were just in Texas the week before.

02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:41.960
A lot of these folks travel to these different things.

02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:43.960
Well, I know there's people that definitely travel,

02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:50.960
but there's a lot of friends I have in both of those regions

02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:55.960
that definitely can't schedule out such a huge disruption

02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:58.960
to take a lot of time off board because they have to fly across the country.

02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:03.960
But if it was right in their hometown or very close by,

02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:05.960
that's a lot of names there.

02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:07.960
And as far as not as many,

02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:12.960
the total amount of studios between the coast definitely leans towards the West Coast.

02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:16.960
But there's still a lot of big-name studios that had to fly everything else over.

02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:19.960
And not every West Coast studio went to PAX either.

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:22.960
I made fun of Capcom earlier, and Konami was another big name that wasn't there.

02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:24.960
Not everybody's going to PAX yet.

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:25.960
Yeah, exactly.

02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:28.960
So I think that also works to their advantage, but they'll still get big names,

02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:33.960
but they're not going to be flooding the doors like, say, Comic-Con on vendors.

02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:36.960
It could be interesting. I wonder how many people would go to both.

02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:38.960
I'm crazy enough I would want to go to both.

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:39.960
Me too.

02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:40.960
I love the East Coast and I wouldn't want to go visit.

02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:43.960
But I also have places to crash at. I have plenty of friends to crash at.

02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:45.960
Especially if the shows are different enough.

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:48.960
If you do get those different exhibitors that show up on the East Coast versus the West Coast,

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:51.960
I think it could be sustainable for two cons.

02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:54.960
And shit, if they're serious about doing the Europe con too,

02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:56.960
shit, people would probably go to that too.

02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:58.960
I mean, I don't know if we would because it's a lot harder.

02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:01.960
When you talk international flight, that's a big one.

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:05.960
But I'm sure if they're doing Eurogamer Expo

02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:07.960
and Leipzig is growing leaps and bounds,

02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:10.960
what they were saying, what, like 200,000 frickin' people at Leipzig or something?

02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.960
Hell, you know, my co-workers were at Leipzig.

02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:15.960
Yeesh. Yeesh.

02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:19.960
So, Bobby Black Wolf's in chat and says, I do eight hours from each.

02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:23.960
And a lot of folks in chat are saying, I would love to go to Paxi's

02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:24.960
and I know I would like to go too.

02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:27.960
And act deft, our poor listener in Mexico says,

02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:29.960
I would just like to have a Mexico con, please.

02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:31.960
Start one.

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:32.960
You never know.

02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:34.960
Call it Mexican.

02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:36.960
Mexican? I like that.

02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:38.960
Yeah.

02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:41.960
All right, Seg, we got a long call, but it's been a great call,

02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:42.960
but I got to wrap it up.

02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:45.960
Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we go to the next call?

02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:48.960
Well, you know, I have to self-promote.

02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:51.960
All cool and attractive people, and that includes you,

02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:55.960
must look into getting Strong Bad.

02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:57.960
Have to plug my own thing.

02:18:57.960 --> 02:18:58.960
I didn't know if you wanted to talk about that,

02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:00.960
but yes, you worked on the Strong Bad game,

02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:02.960
so you're very excited about the release.

02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:03.960
And I hear it's doing very well, right?

02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:05.960
What, third week in a row it's top of the charts on Wii?

02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:06.960
Third week on the top of the charts.

02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.960
All right, let's go for four.

02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:09.960
All right, take care.

02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:10.960
All right, take care, buddy.

02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:11.960
Yep.

02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:12.960
All right, bye-bye.

02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:15.960
All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:16.960
our username on Skype.

02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:19.960
Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.

02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:22.960
I'd be so down with Pax Boston, wouldn't you?

02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:25.960
I would be down if someone would pay my way.

02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:27.960
If we can make it work, we never know.

02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:28.960
All right, let's get another phone call.

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:29.960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:31.960
Who's this?

02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:32.960
Hey, it's the Rob D.

02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:33.960
Hey, Rob D.

02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:34.960
Hello.

02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:36.960
What is on your mind, my friend?

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:37.960
Not too much.

02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:38.960
I hope this connection actually works out pretty well

02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:42.960
because I'm on a new ISP, so this connection may drop.

02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:43.960
So far, so good.

02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:45.960
Just wanted to talk about Pax, really.

02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:48.960
Not too much.

02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:50.960
Well, what did you think of Pax, please?

02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:51.960
Walk us through it.

02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:52.960
Fair enough.

02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:53.960
I saw you guys there, which is excellent,

02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:55.960
and actually I saw many all-gamers there.

02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:58.960
I think about 25 somewhere around there.

02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:00.960
It actually ended up being a very good all-games meetup,

02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:02.960
a very good OLR meetup.

02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:04.960
I had Kevin DDR from the OLR chat room

02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:06.960
and some other just really great people.

02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:08.960
I mean, I was really surprised that...

02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:09.960
Well, I shouldn't say that.

02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:10.960
I shouldn't say that I was surprised,

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:13.960
but it was really great to see that everyone there

02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:14.960
was really just a cool person.

02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:19.960
No one misrepresented themselves online in any way.

02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:21.960
Everyone was just a lot of fun to be around.

02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:23.960
I know this is something we usually say in the past.

02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:25.960
I don't think all games really does this,

02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:27.960
but it was nice to see that everybody kind of adopted

02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:29.960
that creed of don't be a dick.

02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:31.960
Nobody was an asshole, which is a good thing.

02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:33.960
Well, that's because Wil Wheaton had a sign up

02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:35.960
that said don't be a dick.

02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:37.960
Except for me.

02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:38.960
I was an asshole.

02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:41.960
Rob was the biggest diva the whole time.

02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:43.960
I'm king of nice, damn it.

02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:44.960
No, but seriously, in all seriousness,

02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:46.960
everybody was cool.

02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:47.960
You know what I mean?

02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:49.960
Sometimes when you meet strangers from the internet,

02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:50.960
you get a few weirdos in there,

02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:52.960
but everybody was pretty cool.

02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:53.960
You know what I mean?

02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:54.960
Having dinner with you guys

02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:56.960
and actually being able to talk with you guys.

02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:59.960
I will admit that when we were actually broadcasting,

02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:02.960
just being surrounded by Bobby,

02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:05.960
you, Dark Sakura, and Loki,

02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:07.960
I was like, what am I doing here?

02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:08.960
I don't belong here.

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.960
You were being awesome is what you were doing.

02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:11.960
It was great.

02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:13.960
Even when I was looking at some of the other people

02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:15.960
who I've listened to their shows,

02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:18.960
like Luke from Game Addict Hotline, Ninja Sister,

02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:20.960
some of the people that were there,

02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:22.960
just kind of hearing them,

02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:24.960
and I know people have said this about me too

02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:25.960
when they've met me,

02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:27.960
hearing them talk and hearing the radio voice

02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:29.960
as they're sitting right there in front of you

02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:30.960
is kind of strange.

02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:31.960
You know what I mean?

02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:34.960
I don't know if you felt that.

02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:36.960
It's weird because you're so used to hearing it in the iPod,

02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:38.960
you don't really see these people,

02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:39.960
myself included,

02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:42.960
but then to see it all unfold live at PAX

02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:43.960
was kind of weird.

02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:46.960
I think Decipher was one of the people that said that too.

02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:49.960
Man, it's kind of weird to actually see you guys

02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:51.960
while you're talking.

02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:53.960
Yeah, he definitely said that.

02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:56.960
He actually said that when he stepped up to the mic,

02:21:56.960 --> 02:21:57.960
he was shaking a little bit,

02:21:57.960 --> 02:21:58.960
which I thought was kind of funny,

02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:00.960
although I shouldn't make fun of him too much.

02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:01.960
I mean, it's probably the first time

02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:03.960
he's ever done anything like that

02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:05.960
over the internet and broadcasting, that sort of thing.

02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:07.960
Yeah, you learn it's no big deal.

02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:09.960
Any schmo can get an internet show, right?

02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:10.960
It's true.

02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:11.960
All right.

02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:14.960
What about the actual games and sights and sounds of PAX?

02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:18.960
What kind of games did you play at PAX that you liked?

02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:20.960
Well, I played Mortal Kombat vs. DC,

02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:24.960
which surprised me because it was actually fun.

02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:25.960
It's a Mortal Kombat game.

02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:26.960
It'll never be a competitive fighter.

02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:27.960
That's not what Mortal Kombat's for.

02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:31.960
Mortal Kombat's really just for the fatalities,

02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:33.960
all the fun party game stuff,

02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:36.960
watching someone break someone else's body over their back

02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:40.960
and seeing 18 tibias and fibulas fly,

02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:42.960
even though no human could possibly have

02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:44.960
that many bones in their body.

02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:48.960
They were all the same bone over and over.

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:50.960
Exactly.

02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:52.960
But what else did I see?

02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:54.960
The TNA Impact game,

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:56.960
which I am a little bit of a wrestling fan,

02:22:56.960 --> 02:22:58.960
so I had to play that.

02:22:58.960 --> 02:22:59.960
It was sad.

02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:00.960
No one was playing that one.

02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:01.960
I actually went up there.

02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:02.960
One of the developers was there by himself

02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:03.960
playing his own game,

02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:06.960
which was kind of sad in a way.

02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.960
I went up there and played him,

02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:09.960
and it was a good time.

02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:11.960
You made his day, probably.

02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:13.960
Probably, although not as much as I made the day.

02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:15.960
I think it's Locks Quest, people,

02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:17.960
because one of them actually stood right by me

02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:19.960
and walked me through the game

02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:24.960
and explained the different steps of development.

02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:27.960
They have no idea who I am.

02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:29.960
They're hoping that I'm probably some gaming journalist,

02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:30.960
but I'm just a fan,

02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.960
and they're taking all this time to tell me

02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:33.960
because I'm probably the first person to go by there.

02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:37.960
Tower Defense games are not exactly big things at PAX.

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:38.960
Those poor guys.

02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:39.960
I've got to say, though,

02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:40.960
PAX does give a really good shot

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:42.960
to the indie developers and stuff,

02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:44.960
especially with that PAX 10 thing.

02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:46.960
Those 10 indie games were right in the middle of the show floor.

02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:47.960
You can't miss them.

02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:49.960
That's probably how Jamie got caught

02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:51.960
with the sushi game and all that stuff.

02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:52.960
Those guys were great,

02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:54.960
but they were tucked away in the corner.

02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:57.960
They don't really have the Kensha Hall syndrome

02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:58.960
that E3 has,

02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:00.960
where the weird stuff goes to Kensha Hall.

02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:01.960
You've got to go to the basement.

02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:03.960
You know what I mean?

02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:06.960
I never actually made my way over to the PAX 10,

02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:09.960
so I can't say whether that was actually good or not.

02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:11.960
From what I hear, it was okay, at the very least.

02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:13.960
I got so much swag from PAX.

02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:14.960
I got three different shirts.

02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:16.960
I got a bunch of Rockstar stickers.

02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:17.960
I got, what else did I get?

02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:20.960
I didn't actually manage to get one of those energy drink samples,

02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:22.960
which I don't know if you went by there.

02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:24.960
That energy drink booth that was kind of packed away in the corner.

02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:26.960
You thought they were giving away free cans of their drink,

02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:28.960
but it was really, I don't know,

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:30.960
a hundred empty cans just sitting on the table.

02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:32.960
I know. I saw that one.

02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:34.960
They want you to sign up to win a case or something.

02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:35.960
Something like that.

02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:37.960
I did sign up, though, for the ECA,

02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:39.960
and they were giving out balls geek beer.

02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:41.960
Really? I didn't see that.

02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:42.960
Oh, it was so good.

02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:45.960
Root beer with caffeine.

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:46.960
Ooh.

02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:48.960
That does sound good.

02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:49.960
What else did I see?

02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:51.960
I didn't manage to actually play any of the games that had a gigantic line,

02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:52.960
like Little Big Planet.

02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:54.960
I just kind of stayed away from those.

02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:55.960
Aw, you missed out.

02:24:55.960 --> 02:24:57.960
Little Big Planet was great.

02:24:57.960 --> 02:24:59.960
Now, granted, you know, we were a little spoiled

02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:00.960
since we got to go in a little bit early.

02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:01.960
You know, there wasn't a line for it.

02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:04.960
And we got to get walked through by the US producer.

02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:08.960
And, yeah, I was spoiled, but, man, so worth it.

02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:11.960
I'm all about Little Big Planet now.

02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:14.960
Yeah, I have expected the Sonic RPG to be horrible.

02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:15.960
I went by the Sega booth,

02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:17.960
which took me a little while to find at first

02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:21.960
until I realized that there was a gigantic Sega sign.

02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:25.960
Do you know we didn't even realize Sega was there until day two?

02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:27.960
I mean, they didn't exactly...

02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:29.960
Like, there weren't any Sega signs on the booth itself.

02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:31.960
It was just the giant Sega sign hanging from the ceiling,

02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:33.960
and you wouldn't really notice that

02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:35.960
unless you were a really far distance away.

02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:38.960
And by that point, you may have gotten distracted by tons of other booths.

02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:40.960
You know, you're going toward the Sega booth,

02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:42.960
and they're like, ooh, Afro Samurai, I should play that,

02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:43.960
which is also great.

02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:45.960
That game was hot.

02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:49.960
I love the Little Red Riding Hood killing the zombies game.

02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:50.960
That was hot, too.

02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:51.960
That was funny.

02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:53.960
All right, Rob D., we got to wrap it up here

02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:54.960
because we can probably get one more call,

02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:59.960
but quickly, best thing about PAX and worst thing about PAX?

02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:02.960
Best thing about PAX, the people, without question.

02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:04.960
I like the con, I like the exhibitors hall,

02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:06.960
but, you know, actually being able to see everyone

02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:08.960
and talk with the people that I've been chatting with

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:10.960
over the last few years was just,

02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:12.960
really just made for an unparalleled experience at any con I've been to.

02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:14.960
Aw, I'm getting a little choked up here.

02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:15.960
The amount of people.

02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:17.960
The amount of people, by far.

02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:19.960
I couldn't actually make it into any panel without waiting,

02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:21.960
like, at least an hour in line,

02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:24.960
and by the time I saw how long the lines were,

02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:27.960
I just, I didn't even try.

02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:30.960
Yeah, something was going to have to be done about that for next year.

02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:33.960
I don't know what, but they'll think of something fair.

02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:34.960
We'll see.

02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:36.960
Maybe they'll get to organize it,

02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:37.960
they'll figure out how to organize it better.

02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:39.960
I mean, the fact is that they've only had five years,

02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:41.960
which isn't really a long amount of time for any con,

02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:43.960
especially when they've been in the Seattle Convention Center for,

02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:44.960
I think, two years.

02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:45.960
True, very true.

02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:47.960
And there's a whole sixth floor,

02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:49.960
I bet they're going to have to open it next year, we'll see.

02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:50.960
Because what was going on?

02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:51.960
Thanks for taking my call.

02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:53.960
Gender odyssey was going on at the same time we were there?

02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:54.960
I think so.

02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:56.960
Yeah, they kind of kept that on the down low,

02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:01.960
which is probably a good idea with how immature gamers can be on occasion.

02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:03.960
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't have cared, you know,

02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:05.960
heck, with all the years I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show,

02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:06.960
I've seen everything.

02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:11.960
But, you know, I think it's kind of interesting how segregated they kept the two.

02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:12.960
Very interesting.

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:14.960
All right, Rob D., thanks for the call.

02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:15.960
Take care, buddy.

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:16.960
And good to meet you.

02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:17.960
Yep, you too.

02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:18.960
We'll see you next year, right?

02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:19.960
Hopefully.

02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:20.960
All right.

02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:21.960
Work on it.

02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:22.960
Save your pennies now.

02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:23.960
All right, see you.

02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:25.960
That's all I'm going to have to do is start saving now.

02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:28.960
I think we can fit in one more call.

02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:31.960
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:35.960
I think after one more call we should be good here.

02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:37.960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:38.960
Who's this?

02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:39.960
Hello, guy.

02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:42.960
And, like, it's Blade 3.

02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:43.960
Blade 3?

02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:45.960
What is on your mind, Blade 3?

02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:46.960
Not much.

02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:47.960
It's kind of late where I am.

02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:48.960
Where are you?

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:49.960
Are you on the East Coast?

02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:51.960
Yeah, it's 12.

02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:52.960
All right.

02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:54.960
It's way past everyone's bedtime over there.

02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:55.960
But that's all right.

02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:56.960
We're trying to wrap up the show.

02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:57.960
See how I can go to bed.

02:27:57.960 --> 02:27:58.960
What's on your mind?

02:27:58.960 --> 02:27:59.960
What did you call in about tonight?

02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:03.960
Well, I just wanted to tell Rocky, because I'm sure he's still listening,

02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:08.960
that I figured out my own coding for my website.

02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:12.960
Oh, you sent us an email wanting Loki's source code.

02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:13.960
All right.

02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:16.960
Well, I'm sorry to hear he isn't going to give it up,

02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:17.960
but I understand at the same time.

02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:19.960
He still wants to make improvements to it and everything,

02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:23.960
and there's still probably a lot he wants to do with it.

02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:24.960
But that's good.

02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:27.960
You know, hey, nothing like being inspired by something else

02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:28.960
to make your own thing.

02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:31.960
In fact, I think that's kind of how Loki made that listener site,

02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:33.960
is that I think he saw some other stuff

02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:36.960
and kind of tried to make it even better.

02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:39.960
So that's how it was born.

02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:46.960
Yeah, so I made my own, and you can check it out at mmtsp.tk.

02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:47.960
Nice.

02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:48.960
I love that he's working in a plug.

02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:51.960
What will I find on this wonderful PSP site?

02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:56.960
Right now it's in a shimmy data.

02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:58.960
Basically there's just one page,

02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:02.960
and it just has links to other pages with nothing on them so far.

02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:03.960
All right.

02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:05.960
Well, you got to start somewhere.

02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:11.960
By the end of the week, I should have quite a few demos and DVDs,

02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:14.960
some funny videos, and some soundtracks from games.

02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:15.960
All right.

02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:17.960
All right, young entrepreneur,

02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:19.960
we wish you the best of luck with your site.

02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:22.960
Anything else you want to talk about tonight?

02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:23.960
One more thing.

02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:25.960
Yes.

02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:28.960
I'm making a PSP site as an add-on to my regular site,

02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:34.960
and my regular site is masterman.tk.

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:36.960
Plug, plug, plug, plug.

02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:38.960
You know, we're going to start charging 50 bucks a plug,

02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:39.960
just so you know.

02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:41.960
All right, best of luck with your sites, buddy.

02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:42.960
All right.

02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:43.960
Have fun.

02:29:43.960 --> 02:29:44.960
All right.

02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:46.960
So all of our listeners need to go visit these sites,

02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:48.960
and if they're terrible, I want you to tear this guy apart.

02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:49.960
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:50.960
You got to start somewhere.

02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:53.960
We're all about supporting the independents and new ideas.

02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:55.960
And, you know, PSP sites aren't really getting enough love.

02:29:55.960 --> 02:29:57.960
I mean, sure, there's a few sites out there,

02:29:57.960 --> 02:29:59.960
but, man, that's a whole universe.

02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:01.960
It's not really being explored as well as it could be.

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:03.960
So, someday.

02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:05.960
All right, well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:06.960
Sorry for those that didn't get through,

02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:07.960
but you can always send us an email,

02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:08.960
mailbagorangelaundry.com.

02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:10.960
Give Jamie some work to do next week.

02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:12.960
Make her read more emails, right, Jamie?

02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:13.960
No.

02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:14.960
I actually have stories.

02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:15.960
Oh, you have a last-minute story or two?

02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:16.960
Things popped up.

02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:17.960
Go for it.

02:30:17.960 --> 02:30:19.960
Just in case no one knew,

02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:22.960
Microsoft actually did lower the download content prices.

02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:25.960
I have the list of what they lowered.

02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:26.960
Cool.

02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:27.960
Have we mentioned this before?

02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:28.960
I don't think so.

02:30:28.960 --> 02:30:32.960
I think it was a sale that was only for this weekend.

02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:33.960
I believe so.

02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:34.960
Could be wrong.

02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:35.960
I don't remember.

02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:39.960
But Mass Effect went down to 300 points of Bring Down the Sky.

02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:42.960
Lost Odyssey Triple Bonus Pack went to 120.

02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:45.960
Forza Motorsport 2, the Motegi Track Pack,

02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:51.960
and the September, December, March car packs went down to 240 each.

02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:55.960
Oblivion Elder Scrolls IV Shivering Isles went to 1600.

02:30:55.960 --> 02:30:57.960
Guitar Hero 3, Def Leppard, Foo Fighters,

02:30:57.960 --> 02:31:00.960
Classic Rock Track Packs to 360.

02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:04.960
Beautiful Katamari, the Accessory ABCD set went to 120.

02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:06.960
Special Accessory as well.

02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:08.960
Just Size stage went to 120.

02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:13.960
And the Big 10, 11 stages went to 140.

02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:16.960
So that's it.

02:31:16.960 --> 02:31:17.960
All right.

02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:18.960
I like sales.

02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:19.960
I like cheap things.

02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:21.960
All right.

02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:22.960
I do have a last minute story real quick.

02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:24.960
It has to do with the Max Payne movie.

02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:25.960
Tiger Claw sent me this one.

02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:27.960
I remember reading about this earlier in the week.

02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:28.960
It didn't make our show roll, though.

02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:32.960
But apparently the Max Payne movie has been rated R and not happy.

02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:34.960
John Moore, the director of the movie, is pissed.

02:31:34.960 --> 02:31:37.960
It was supposed to be a PG-13 movie.

02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:39.960
I'm hoping he's lobbying the MPAA.

02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:41.960
What a bunch of fuck wads.

02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:43.960
I mean, really, have you heard about some of the shit they pull?

02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:46.960
I just, I hate the MPAA.

02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:47.960
I really do.

02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:52.960
You know, the fact that they, God, that movies can be so freaking violent and crazy and,

02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:56.960
you know, they get an R, but heaven forbid you show a wiener or some titties and, you

02:31:56.960 --> 02:31:58.960
know, you risk getting an NC-17.

02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:01.960
It's just horrible what they've done.

02:32:01.960 --> 02:32:07.960
Anyhow, the MPAA has slapped an R on this movie, which means it's not going to be able to be

02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:10.960
seen by teenagers, which who knows, maybe it really is for the best.

02:32:10.960 --> 02:32:12.960
Maybe we have blurred the lines too much with what is safe.

02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:14.960
Max Payne, I would definitely put an R on that.

02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:19.960
Well, apparently, though, he actually, he did try to dumb it down a little bit.

02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:22.960
Like, he actually kind of cut out some of the language.

02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:24.960
No heads are cut off.

02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:26.960
No eyeballs are ripped out or any of that stuff.

02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:30.960
He actually did tame it down a bit to try and get the PG-13 and still got the R.

02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:35.960
So he was kind of, kind of miffed about that, as you can understand.

02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:36.960
But here's the thing.

02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:42.960
He actually goes, so far as to say, they gave The Dark Knight a PG-13 rating and basically

02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:44.960
sucked Warner Brothers' cock.

02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:46.960
His words, not mine.

02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:48.960
But you know, yeah, it's something to think about.

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:51.960
You know, The Dark Knight was a pretty dark film too.

02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:57.960
I think it just goes to show the MPAA is fucked.

02:32:57.960 --> 02:32:59.960
So fire them all, that's what I say.

02:32:59.960 --> 02:33:01.960
And then, yeah, that's another thing I've been thinking about.

02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:04.960
And Quel Tipo brings us up, that Zack and Miri make a porno.

02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:05.960
I don't know if you've heard about this.

02:33:05.960 --> 02:33:10.960
The Kevin Smith movie was originally rated NC-17 because, oh my God, porno.

02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:12.960
They were able to talk it down to an R somehow.

02:33:12.960 --> 02:33:17.960
But then they ended up banning the first poster for the movie because it implied that there

02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:19.960
was oral sex.

02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:21.960
Get over it.

02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:22.960
I don't know.

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:25.960
It's just a little stupid.

02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:28.960
Quel Tipo does say though, and I think this is interesting, I'd be more willing to see

02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:32.960
an R-rated Max Payne than a PG-13 version.

02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:33.960
Tigerclaw says, here's the thing.

02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:38.960
The first Mortal Kombat movie was PG-13 even though it was based on an M-rated game.

02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:41.960
The movie wins you back because of all the kick-ass fight sequences.

02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:43.960
Hmm, something to think about.

02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:45.960
So lots of good points made by everybody.

02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:48.960
All right, well, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:50.960
Hey, thanks, you guys, for sticking with us tonight.

02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:54.960
And myself and Dark Soccer are holding down the fort.

02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:58.960
It was very lovely having you all in chat tonight to help fill in as our third host tonight.

02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:00.960
We always love having you guys on the program.

02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:02.960
Thank you, guys.

02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:06.960
And so we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.

02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:09.960
Final thoughts, Dark Soccer, your final thought?

02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:11.960
Poop.

02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:12.960
Lovely.

02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:16.960
My final thought is fart.

02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.960
Hey, no, no, you said fart, so I have to say dick.

02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:21.960
All right.

02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:23.960
We have some other final thoughts from chat.

02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:26.960
Shaq-Fu, that's a good final thought.

02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:28.960
Your Shaq-Fu moment of the day.

02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:29.960
All right, that's going to do it.

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:32.960
Hey, guys, thank you so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting

02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:35.960
like Orange Lounge Radio where dick and fart jokes are still okay.

02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:37.960
We haven't sold out yet.

02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:39.960
What about boob and burp jokes?

02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:41.960
Boob and burp jokes are always welcome.

02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:45.960
Thank you, guys, so much for supporting us and leaving us the nice things you have been on iTunes lately.

02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:47.960
There's been a couple people that added reviews.

02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:49.960
Thank you, guys, so much for your kind reviews.

02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:51.960
We'd always appreciate a few more five-star reviews.

02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:55.960
It really helps out our ranking and, therefore, as we get bumped up in the rankings, we're more visible.

02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:58.960
Even if you can't do that, just tell a couple friends about the show.

02:34:58.960 --> 02:34:59.960
That's all we ask.

02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:01.960
That's our super powers, extra visibility.

02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:02.960
You got it.

02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:03.960
Word of mouth.

02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:04.960
And how.

02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:05.960
We have no magazine.

02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:07.960
We have no corporate-funded website.

02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:09.960
We don't sell ads.

02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:12.960
It's all about the word of mouth, so we appreciate it.

02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:14.960
But I do sell my virtual body on the internet.

02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:15.960
Just kidding.

02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:21.960
Until next time and until the next Penny Arcade Expo to see some of you guys again in person,

02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:22.960
although hopefully not.

02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:23.960
We'll see some of you guys around.

02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:29.960
There's certainly talk of ASEN for next year and definitely E for All for me, so we'll be seeing you guys later.

02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:33.960
But until next week, when Loki will be back, this is Rob Roberts.

02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:34.960
She's Dark Sakura.

02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:36.960
He's at home listening, Loki.

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:37.960
We'll all be back next week.

02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:38.960
We are together.

02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:40.960
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:45.960
