15270	25207	We take some time to decompress after Penny Arcade Expo, Luminous makes its way to yet another platform, and could a new Kingdom Hearts game be showing at Tokyo Game Show?
31687	32267	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
52081	52942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
79079	81517	She's replaced him with Rob's laundry Yes
82811	83932	No, just kidding, of course.
84332	88394	He's away at a thing for his day job today that he had to go to, so he won't be here tonight.
88815	90556	But he'll be back next week, as we all will.
91136	92757	And we have no guests tonight either.
93157	101903	It's just the lovely DarkSakura, myself, feeling the love with all you kids from our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
102083	104004	And we have some stuff there in chat.
104044	107186	Gsquared68 says, Orange Laundry Mower Radio.
107746	109267	I tried to get Dan to come tonight.
109547	109747	Yeah?
109767	111288	What was his excuse?
111428	112029	He had to work.
112592	113673	Aw, bummer.
113833	115534	Stupid job!
115554	120537	Weren't you telling me that Dan, gosh, he so, so just worked and worn out.
120577	122658	He was playing Street Fighter IV this week or something?
123178	126240	It was at the Game Crazy Manager Conference.
126360	133384	They either had it there or he went to an arcade that had one, but he played Street Fighter IV and said that it was pretty good, but the jumping was weird.
134045	134205	Hmm.
135174	136597	It looks very slick from what I've seen.
136657	138560	I'm looking forward to getting my hands on it.
138860	139101	Nice.
139642	140143	Very excited.
140163	142026	Of course, that's not the one I'm excited about.
142166	142988	What are you excited about?
143482	147204	Freakin' Capcom vs. Tatsunoko I had a feeling Any particular reason?
147264	147964	Gatchaman!
148365	167195	Well, yeah, Gatchaman And Dan was like, it doesn't have Joe in it I was like, but it has Ken, and it has Hurricane Polymer And Kashan, so it's all cool Alright, very nice And Techamon Gsquared68 is also mentioning in our chatroom San Jose State has it, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump from us So maybe we have to take a road trip at some point
167947	168748	That would be cool.
168768	169208	That would be fun.
169608	172430	A little OLR road trip as if Seattle wasn't fun enough.
172850	176452	Speaking of Seattle, Penny Arcade Expo.
176573	184117	Unfortunately, we did not get to do our own show just due to some technical difficulties, but we contributed to... Shut up.
184357	185298	No, no, no, no, no.
185358	188000	Due to... I'm going to come clean on this one.
188540	192222	Due to when we were going to be doing a show, Jamie instead passed out.
193223	196486	I had technical difficulties with my ability to stay awake.
196506	197127	You know what, Rob?
197147	197367	Yeah.
215282	219126	It was fantastic.
219266	221007	And some Bobby bonding as well.
221107	222989	And some hatred of the Western Internet.
224330	226012	Yes, the Western Internet was sucky.
226432	227853	And some bonding with our listeners.
228274	230956	We had just a wonderful turnout.
230976	233378	Such an experience with that superglue and duct tape, I swear.
236363	237584	BlackWolf is clarifying in chat there was no bondage
265748	266769	I don't know where that came from.
266829	267971	I think some of our chatters are going there.
267991	268591	I just said bonding.
268671	269973	I meant literally, you know.
270113	270714	Bonding.
270934	271975	It was that episode.
272155	272696	No, I'm just kidding.
272836	273056	Anyhow.
273397	275619	Alright, so how was your Penny Arcade Expo, DarkSakura?
275639	281386	I know we usually start with how was your gaming week, but seeing as Penny Arcade Expo was such a... We'll get to gaming week post-packs later.
281706	282928	How was your Penny Arcade Expo?
282948	284750	What kind of stuff did you see at the show that you enjoyed?
284970	286692	Walk us through your time at Penny Arcade Expo a little bit.
286992	301238	Well, I was in a daze, you know, that Friday, because I was just all like, pretty, shiny, Namco, hang out with Namco for an hour, you know, and they were just selling stuff, but I was like, dude, I don't care, because it's Namco, and I wanted a Dig Dug plushie and couldn't get one.
301258	302698	Did you miss the memo that Namco hates us?
303379	304399	Katamari, remember that?
304819	305259	Ah, forget it.
305299	306720	So... I'm kidding.
307100	307841	I love Namco!
338304	340626	I really, really like LittleBigPlanet.
341067	342508	I thought that was pretty cool.
342988	345050	I liked what I saw of Spore.
345531	347752	We're probably gonna get it eventually.
348033	352276	I don't really have much time to play it, so it's whenever Dan gets it.
353057	354678	I actually liked Wii Music.
355996	358538	because I thought that it was just neat.
359259	370648	I thought that, you know, and I like... I'm one of those people who likes finding, you know, MIDI programs and then redoing all the instruments in the MIDI to sound completely bizarre.
371289	380156	So that's actually one of the things that I liked about Wii Music is that it just had that playing with MIDI tones type of thing to it.
382538	383779	Animal Crossing, it was...
385289	389374	Animal Crossing, and I really liked the Wario game.
389394	390435	That one was kind of cool.
391797	397002	And I went over to hang out with, okay, was it EA?
397343	398064	No, it wasn't EA.
398164	399806	EA had some of the crap.
399946	402368	Just so you know, Bobby just disowned you because you like Wii music.
403590	405292	I didn't say that I was going to play it.
405332	406233	I just thought it was neat.
409495	412417	This comes from my old, what was my third major?
412457	413317	Music major, right?
414678	416379	I'm on major number 12 now.
416559	418520	I would be all over Wii Music if I was 12.
418580	421061	Yeah, I thought it was neat.
421101	424803	It would be something that would be fun to waste some time with, I thought.
425564	426184	At any rate.
426304	426845	I gotta say this.
427105	434409	Black Wolf just said, I liked and Wii Music do not belong in the same sentence, unless in the context of, I liked to hate on Wii Music.
435985	438646	I think we said this in an earlier show when we first talked about Wii Music.
439166	443327	If it gets kids into real music, it's a good thing, regardless.
443347	444267	That's what I think.
444487	448788	It's a great platform into learning a bit more.
448928	451309	Because really, it teaches tempo.
451689	453790	It teaches a little bit of arrangement.
453950	457450	I thought it's a neat little concept.
457631	460551	I would have totally loved to have something like this when I was little.
460951	461992	I played Mario Paint.
463172	463432	You know?
464502	464942	MarioPaint
483061	484082	Sushi Bumper Sumo Fun Game
507157	516381	And as I was saying earlier when Bobby called in, you play as a sushi plate and you have to keep the other piece of sushi away from the others.
516781	520203	And they can knock you into the conveyor belt and you lose a piece of sushi.
520523	526125	And whoever holds on to the sushi for the longest time within two minutes gets a higher score and wins.
526245	527886	Basically, keep away with sushi.
528587	528667	And...
529947	532930	It was a really fun, weird little game.
532990	539296	And from what I understand, it's supposed to be coming out on an Xbox Live Arcade, so I'm looking forward to that.
542358	548144	I really, really wish I had earplugs for all the people who couldn't sing that were playing Rock Band and Guitar Hero.
548904	552908	Because, I mean, you've got a bar telling you when you're out of tune, you should actually pay attention to it.
555428	566057	I'm sorry, I don't know if I've said so before on the show, but I hear perfect pitch, which drove me nuts in band, but I really can't filter out.
567250	569671	That's why I don't like to sing in front of people because I can hear it in myself.
570011	570871	That's why I don't sing.
572852	580274	At any rate, other stuff that I saw that was really cool was Pink Godzilla because I bought stuff from Pink Godzilla.
581394	584495	For anyone who doesn't know, my anniversary was on the 1st.
584595	589136	Dan and I have been married for three years and I bought him his anniversary present from Pink Godzilla.
589197	593978	I got him a salamander pack for PSP.
594318	595359	That's nerd love right there.
595479	596080	That is nerd love.
596100	597682	Well, he got me an iPod that he got for free.
599484	602887	He re-gifted for your anniversary?
603348	603888	That's fine.
603948	604549	I don't care.
604749	605590	At least it's an iPod.
606191	610455	Yeah, it's little in red and it says the GameStop Special Edition or some shit on it.
611296	613959	But anyway, other fun stuff.
616744	619206	I liked hanging out with the Commander 3 people.
619286	619987	They were kind of cool.
620587	621488	Actually, they were really cool.
621528	624671	And I actually went to talk to some of the digital design students.
628094	628474	Dork.
629475	633139	You can't do this in Wii Music, but you can do it in Mario Paint.
633159	636682	That's actually a pretty decent little arrangement.
640705	643106	Where's my bucket so I can roll it at you?
645067	646007	Sorry, couldn't resist.
646227	646547	Anyway.
646827	648948	Wii Music will never have the greatness of the Mario Paint.
648988	650449	Mario Paint was fantastic.
650489	652229	We need Mario Paint the sequel.
652249	655450	We need Mario Paint 2 Electric Boogaloo.
658659	667245	Other stuff that I saw slash played or did, yeah, I was mentioning, I was talking to a lot of the digital design schools that try to get people to sign up for their schools.
667345	675110	They really actually got a lot of good tips for myself as far as things to study in my current major.
675130	682075	I mean, they were all like, we'd prefer you to go to our school, but there's a few of them that were actually beginning transfer programs I was kind of looking into.
682095	687859	There's one in Sunnyvale, and that would just be really cool because then I'd be close to Capcom's testing grounds, and that would be sweet.
688559	714923	um also um trying out all the fun restaurants going to Gameworks which was oddly disappointing because I couldn't win that Tales out of the Crane game and there was an incredible incredible lack of Planet Harriers so I wanted to cry and sob tears of you know of disappointment for having no Planet Harrier because Planet Harrier is one of the greatest arcade games ever ever are
716344	717184	Um, what?
718385	720106	Rob's looking like he's up to something, everybody.
721666	723947	No, they just wanted to link to the YouTube and chat.
724407	728769	So I just put it in there in true Mario Paint Roll fashion.
728809	731030	I put, dude, this YouTube is so cool, and then put the link.
731230	732170	So we'll see how many people click.
732190	732390	Dork.
734540	738541	Well, I also played, actually I was very surprised about how much I liked it.
738621	749964	I played the Ninja Gaiden demo on DS, and it was really, really cool, but there was another DS demo that actually was really freaking fun, and that was the Arkanoid demo.
750744	758946	I used to play Arkanoid back in the day on the old, you know, Game Brick, the old Game Boy, and that was pretty fun.
759646	763827	And I saw people playing a WonderSwan, and I wished I had brought my WonderSwan.
764489	766871	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
790859	792962	TurboGrafx Duo Laptop
810689	812573	which had its own little screen and everything.
812773	814276	Really freaking expensive.
814736	816059	And so I saw someone who had one.
816439	820847	And then I got to meet my musical hero, Jonathan Coulton.
821608	823432	And I got to meet my geek hero, Wil Wheaton.
824673	825533	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
850121	852142	It was just really fun.
852422	856504	There were the free game panels, there were movies, there were performances.
856844	858025	This wasn't like E3.
858065	859385	This was a freaking convention.
859605	860446	That's what this was.
862466	866368	E3 is a media spectacle, I should say.
867549	875032	PAX is like an anime con, but just video games.
876112	882553	I would like to say to all of you folks that went to Penny Arcade Expo, I'm quite proud of the majority of you for knowing how to bathe properly.
883413	883894	I know!
883974	895016	It was actually a pretty pleasant smelling, I mean, don't get me wrong, there were a few people that smelled like fart, but some people, the most people It's the gym sock syndrome, you can tell who's been sleeping in the lounge.
895116	897836	Most people were very well bathed, and I appreciate it.
898036	902217	And all the all games people were well, well bathed, so thank you all.
903447	905488	I really, I just really had a good time.
905568	907149	You know what, it felt a lot... Except for DMN.
908129	908769	Dirty bastard.
909229	910410	It felt a lot like going to Faname.
911490	912651	Is that the impression that you got?
913671	917373	Kinda, but it was all games, so I felt like I understood it.
917933	919533	I felt like it was... As opposed to Faname.
919613	925816	And on top of that, I thought that it was very well organized as far as getting into some of the events, even though I didn't go to the one event I wanted to go to.
926949	928129	Well, that and the Nerdcore Rising.
928770	931551	I got to see MC Frontalot, but I didn't buy anything from him.
931671	931891	Oh, well.
932671	937993	Anyway, but it was just really, I thought, well-organized in how they had everything together.
938013	940053	And it gave everybody a fair opportunity.
940614	944075	So that was even what impressed me a whole lot more.
944335	945515	That and there was some cosplay.
945575	946115	Oh, my God.
946736	948156	It was very convention-like.
948336	949817	Except there was some really shitty cosplay.
950137	952878	And whoever that was who cosplayed the bride who wasn't wearing underwear...
954138	955279	You need to eat a steak, girl.
955560	957261	I'm sorry.
957801	969531	When you can see someone's pelvic bones, their hips, no, that's a sign that somebody needs to freaking sit down with a porterhouse and chow down.
970412	972534	Sorry, and nobody wants to see your ass.
972574	972874	Thank you.
974059	977163	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
991739	992480	DarkSakura.com
1008513	1036505	has the potential to be neat or really really stale and right now it's feeling a little stale so I just really hope the internet functionality is built in there the way we're all dreaming of because that's going to be what saves this game the Wario Land game was great too but you know obviously that's something we've kind of already seen here in studio if you've been paying attention in the last few episodes as far as other stuff that Jamie didn't talk about because I don't think it's quite up her alley Warhammer Online I got to check out a little bit they had a booth set up there and
1037065	1037445	I forgot my name
1060191	1062032	To me, which isn't a bad thing.
1062072	1063293	WoW is a great formula.
1063693	1068735	And, you know, it has slightly nicer graphics and it, you know, kind of tracks your quests a little differently.
1068775	1070976	And of course, naturally, you have different classes, different races.
1071336	1072717	So it's not the exact same as WoW.
1072957	1075778	But I just would have liked to have seen a little more on the floor.
1075818	1080921	I understand they showed some of this in panels, but, you know, those were impossible to get into without waiting forever.
1081161	1081862	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1099941	1102203	LittleBigPlanet, loved it, loved it.
1102303	1103744	Game of the show for me, honestly.
1104004	1108787	I was very surprised at just really how good Sony's booth was, all things considered.
1108847	1114690	I actually thought the games Sony was showing was probably better than the stuff Nintendo was showing on a whole.
1115811	1117072	Sinkstar looked fun, I didn't get a chance to play it though
1139727	1141269	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1155903	1157205	I played Katana, she played Catwoman.
1157245	1158286	Oh yeah, that's right, we did play that.
1158346	1158886	It was fun!
1159006	1160047	It was kind of fun.
1160288	1163531	You know, I said this when I was kind of trying to summarize the show in my live journal.
1163611	1166814	It's never going to be as great as Marvel vs. Capcom.
1167334	1176744	You know, and Mortal Kombat has always been a little bit of a, I don't know, not so serious, at least to me, especially like in any Mortal Kombat game since like 2.0.
1177864	1183826	It's not like a real hardcore fighting game.
1183886	1188168	It's more of a game that seems to not take itself so seriously, at least in my mind.
1188588	1189068	You know what I mean?
1190069	1192770	And I think the trend continues here with DC Universe.
1192790	1197271	You really are just kind of taking out Mortal Kombat characters and putting in DC Universe characters instead, but it's the same engine.
1197751	1204274	I don't think it's a game anyone's going to remember years from now or lavish praise on, but was it a lot of big dumb fun?
1204294	1204594	Yeah!
1204614	1204894	Yeah!
1205394	1206375	D&D 4th Edition D&D 4th Edition D&D 4th Edition
1223896	1246746	and then let's see there's another game at PAX Puzzle Quest Galactrix I'll say really quickly I got to play a little bit of they had that playable on the show floor and you just have to really think it's not like Bejeweled anymore I mean it is but now it's on a hexagon which completely changes the way you have to think about the game but I enjoy myself with that game I just hope it's not too I mean that well I'm kind of thinking you know I hope it's not too much of the same
1247046	1251850	But they really did try to mix it up with putting it on the hexagon and kind of giving it the space theme.
1251890	1252971	I think it'll be kind of cool.
1253992	1259357	I was very disappointed, though, that they were showing a trailer for Star Trek Online on the floor, but not any actual gameplay.
1259437	1260237	That didn't make me disappointed.
1260257	1262559	That made my heart hurt because I'm totally going to play that.
1262680	1263100	Yeah, me too.
1263120	1264281	I was hoping to see a little more on that.
1264341	1265022	But I understand.
1265062	1265442	It's early.
1265502	1265882	It's early.
1266243	1266863	I'm not hating.
1266923	1270887	It's just, you know, it got my hopes up only to be crushed by disappointment.
1271427	1273048	And one more game I'll mention.
1274222	1275683	Iron Chef America is crap
1300638	1302058	I think it'll be a lot of big dumb fun.
1302098	1303699	I did like how you could garnish your plate.
1303739	1304439	That was kind of fun.
1304919	1305359	I like that.
1305819	1308920	Well, I guess part of it is presentation.
1309800	1310040	Yeah.
1311921	1312841	Yeah, it was cool.
1313481	1314941	I'm looking at comments from chat.
1314961	1317362	TheRobD says, Iron Mama, in a way.
1318202	1318562	Let's see.
1318582	1320883	I'm looking at other comments from chat here.
1320943	1324584	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to add some things to the chat.
1326386	1329528	and I can't say this name, K-H-A-S-N, Kassen.
1330088	1330909	I don't know if that's how you say it.
1331289	1332210	The game looks bad.
1333651	1339054	The graphics aren't stellar, but it is on the Wii, which doesn't really do the high def stuff so well.
1339074	1343397	A game is only... Play it first.
1343657	1346539	A game with crappy graphics can still be fun.
1346579	1347940	Look at the old Atari 2600 games.
1348300	1349581	Unless it's E.T.
1349901	1355345	Again, it's not going to be anything you're going to remember for a lifetime, but for $20, it's a good waste of time.
1355945	1358347	So, I guess that's all I really want to say about PAX.
1359728	1360628	How was your gaming week?
1360668	1365291	I'll talk some more about the whole PAX broadcast and all that in just a little bit when we get to housekeeping.
1365651	1367893	I do want to say, though, how was your gaming week after PAX?
1367913	1369794	Did you play anything post-PAX that you want to talk about?
1369834	1370635	Well, Ragnarok.
1371635	1374697	And I played a stellar game of Black Knight 2000 Pinball.
1375738	1377819	For the record, we are selling our Black Knight 2000 Pinball.
1378440	1379981	Oh, are you disappointed about that, or is it time?
1380001	1381002	We want one with a better playfield.
1381422	1381742	Oh, okay.
1381962	1384744	We're also selling our Star Trek The Next Generation Pinball.
1386004	1387966	because, again, we want a better table.
1387986	1388827	All right.
1388847	1391470	Well, as long as you're going to get it back because I love Next Generation.
1391551	1399920	And any listener who is willing to trade across the board, we will trade our creature from the Black Lagoon for a Lord of the Rings pinball, please.
1400942	1405947	I'm making a mention on behalf of my husband because I really don't care for a creature from the Black Lagoon anyway.
1406668	1420980	um but no um i uh i did play uh a lot of uh i actually did play a lot of uh um solitaire just because i have that kind of time which is not really so
1421926	1422526	That's about it.
1423006	1426327	I'm in school, so it's not like I have time to really do a lot of playing.
1426567	1426967	That's cool.
1427688	1430808	I played a lot of Rock Band and Guitar Hero this week.
1430848	1447773	I went back to kind of milk the last little bit out of those games that I'm going to before the new sequels come out because we're only a few days away from Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band 2 coming out, so I'm just kind of squeezing the last little bit out of those games because, yeah, I plan to export the Rock Band tracks and then get rid of the game.
1447813	1450374	I mean, even if I only get a few bucks for it, I'll take it.
1451414	1452924	because I don't really plan to play it much longer.
1452964	1454514	But I'll tell you what bugs me about Rock Band.
1455495	1466703	You freaking people that play online matches like in score battle or what have you and then when I'm beating you and I'm about to win the song with like 20,000 points over you, you freaking quit so I don't get credit for the song.
1466883	1467723	I hate that.
1468083	1473227	I have been leaving negative feedback though on people that do that because that pisses me off and I encourage people to do that.
1473507	1484895	Don't forget like if people quit early because they can't suck it up that someone beat them at the game, freaking leave them a negative review so it does affect their little score because I think that is such bull crap and the rock band should,
1485615	1487075	I did actually have another edition of my gaming week.
1487135	1487535	I received a game.
1487555	1488796	My wonderful husband has finally brought me home.
1488836	1491056	The world ends with you, so I'm going to be playing that.
1491156	1491976	Oh, cool.
1511420	1512000	Finally!
1512120	1513321	When you beat that, I want to borrow it.
1513521	1514541	I'm going to go and check that out.
1514781	1516042	You will be first in line.
1528727	1529828	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1558260	1558640	There you go.
1558700	1560381	This person sucks ass.
1560541	1566023	Yeah, sadly you can't filter down that good, but you can leave the reason why you're putting them on your frown list.
1566063	1567884	There's a smile list and a frown list.
1568204	1570725	And if you want to mark their frown because they quit early, you can do that.
1571365	1573546	And so I've done that for you rock band fools.
1573807	1577108	I'm going to start reading names on the show of gamer tags that have quit out on me.
1577448	1577768	Do it.
1578088	1582670	In fact, I'll look up the name while you're reading the next story and call them out here on the program.
1582690	1583130	That'll be fun.
1585032	1586013	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1610677	1610917	Go ahead.
1611318	1611518	What?
1612058	1612818	Xbox Live Arcade.
1613178	1614059	I checked out Gin Rummy.
1615139	1616960	The presentation of that game is actually really nice.
1617640	1619781	I just wish there was more to it than just Gin Rummy.
1619801	1625283	Because I think there's... Sierra, our masters, are doing card games on the computer and such.
1625363	1628224	So it's kind of nice to see them getting into it on Xbox Live Arcade.
1628264	1629925	I just wish there had been a little more to it.
1630465	1633366	And I just didn't feel like the price justified it.
1633386	1636507	Because I know this sounds harsh, but I could get a real deck of cards.
1637088	1637408	Then again...
1638508	1641551	I can say the same thing about Uno, but yet Uno is so much fun on Xbox Live.
1641611	1643112	I can't explain what it is, the difference.
1643553	1652060	Maybe, I don't know, maybe it's the fact more people are on Uno or that Uno is so disgustingly simple and you can literally just sit down and play for five minutes and Rummy takes a little more time.
1652140	1652420	I don't know.
1652921	1654422	How about rock band stuff?
1654960	1655781	How about Rock Band stuff?
1655941	1660184	There is actually a Rock Band 2 track list that is ranked by difficulty for Xbox 360.
1660224	1661645	Hold on, hold on, we're not in story chat.
1661665	1663326	Hold on, sorry.
1663886	1664347	No, no, no, no.
1664767	1667929	I don't know why I'm... I gotta get to housekeeping.
1668510	1671011	You know what, I thought that you had read your story and I completely blanked, so I'm sorry.
1671032	1672513	Because we're starting with a Rock Band story tonight.
1672533	1672893	That's okay.
1673153	1673934	Because I thought that you...
1674594	1675795	That's alright, I'm done with my gaming week.
1675935	1677956	Let's do housekeeping and then we can talk about Rock Band, okay?
1677996	1679496	Can I go crawl under the couch now?
1679516	1680437	No, you're fine, you're fine.
1681457	1682257	Housekeeping tonight.
1682798	1685339	I wanted to mention of Penny Arcade coverage.
1686239	1690221	The seven hours, eight hours worth of stuff we did at Penny Arcade Expo is up.
1690321	1692702	It was really Bobby that did it all because he was there the whole time.
1692782	1696764	But we, at least I, pretty much was there all day Friday and all day Saturday.
1696904	1699745	DarkSakura and Loki spent pretty much all their time there too.
1700505	1701066	So check that out.
1701126	1701446	PAX...
1702286	1709909	.allgames.com is there and that's where you can actually get now some video is being posted as well of the interviews that Bobby did.
1710009	1712630	He actually has some interviews and I think I showed up in the first one.
1712670	1714351	I asked a question of the JumpGate Evolution guy.
1715131	1717372	So it's there and you can download it and it's neat.
1717692	1718833	Bobby did a very good job with the videos.
1718853	1719333	I was very happy.
1720714	1727656	E4ALL is the next expo on the radar and sadly all three of us are not going to be going to E4ALL but I am.
1727816	1731518	I'm going to go for E4ALL to represent Orange Launch Radio and I know a lot of folks might be thinking why
1732208	1761634	E4ALL does not appear to be having the big exhibitor list of other conventions and to me I actually think that's kind of the charm of it I want to go and promote Orange Lounge Radio to the gamers that will show up and from what I hear All Games is going to have a heck of a booth there their theme has to do with classic games I'm not sure how much I can and can't say about the booth but from what I've heard it's going to be a good time so if you're in the LA area you should come out and check us out at E4ALL I will be there also best for last
1762910	1764351	OLRPSP.com
1783820	1784341	DarkSakura.com
1800833	1804995	or heck, if you want to tune in to some of the other programming, tune in at 4.45pm Pacific Sunday night.
1805575	1812358	Go on your PSP to the Orange Lounge Radio All Games listener and you go right to All Games Radio and listen to everything.
1812418	1812858	It's great.
1812958	1813758	Check it out.
1814558	1819500	I can say how great it is without sounding like I have an ego because Loki did it all.
1819780	1823722	He really did a great job, not just for us representing Orange Lounge Radio but for representing allgames.com.
1824082	1827766	Plus he let out a series of colorful expletives while he was working on it, and that was pretty funny.
1827806	1829909	Yes, it was funny to watch, so good times.
1830990	1832552	So check that out, olrpsp.com.
1832973	1835335	Also, we're trying something new tonight.
1836266	1838127	OhChat28 is giving an endorsement.
1838327	1840668	It says the PSP All Games Radio is pretty damn cool.
1840888	1843249	Tonight we're trying something new.
1843309	1847730	Since it is just DarkSakura and myself here in studio, our Skype line is going to be open all night.
1848351	1849771	We're going to take calls as we get them tonight.
1849791	1850671	We're trying something new.
1851372	1854633	If you feel at any time you want to call in and give us a call, comment on what's going on.
1854913	1855373	1-877-GAME-OLR
1878567	1880949	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1905789	1921162	which you know Gabe and Tycho at Penny Arcade they love that and the other cool thing the performers in the PAX pack were actually people that were at Penny Arcade Expo so even if you were not there live at the show it's kind of like you could have PAX in your house a little bit
1922163	1927807	And you can play along to Skullcrusher Mountain by Jonathan Colton, which you gotta love that here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1927827	1928728	We've talked about that before.
1929308	1934932	Livin' on the Corner of Dude and Catastrophe by MC Frontalot and Shhh by Darkest of the Hillside Thickets.
1935032	1935913	Three bucks.
1936613	1938775	Shhh, by the way, is a previously unreleased track.
1939315	1942818	The other two songs have been released before and they are all master recordings.
1942838	1949122	So if you have Rock Band and you want to feel good about donating to Child's Play and get some music at the same time, there you have it.
1949963	1951324	Rock Band Packs Pack.
1953692	1955014	I'm going to do my story now.
1955714	1958718	So, gee, DarkSakura, do you have anything you want to share with us by chance?
1958738	1960279	Oh, stop making fun of me, okay?
1960419	1962682	Can't resist.
1962742	1963162	It's my job.
1963222	1965124	Infinite Undiscovery has an ad on this.
1965204	1965705	No, I'm just kidding.
1967267	1968248	Oh, yeah, that was pretty, too.
1968608	1970791	I forgot to mention Infinite Undiscovery.
1970891	1975275	I bought it, and I played it for an hour, and I was extremely disappointed.
1976144	2001680	Compared to what I played at PAX I thought at PAX I had a good time at PAX But I really hated the opening of this game I think God, the whole ogre chase thing Is not a way to start the game That was a horrible idea And it really just made me disinterested almost in the whole thing It doesn't suck how like one poorly planned level Can just ruin an entire game I'm gonna try and stick it out and try to get to some of the parts I saw at Penny Arcade Expo But I was not happy with Infinite and Discovery Anyhow, sorry, go ahead
2002150	2013959	All right, well, the song list that I mentioned before in order of difficulty is for Rock Band 2, sorry, is Eye of the Tiger, Float On, Today Hungry Like the Wolf, Cool for Cats, Pretend We're Dead.
2014439	2015460	I love that song.
2015920	2021304	My Own Worst Enemy, One Step Closer, We Got the Beat, That's What You Get, Rebel... Wait, this is guitar difficulty, right?
2022294	2031781	Rebel Girl, So What You Want, Drain You, New Kid in School, Hello There, Lump, American Woman, Mountain Song, Man in the Box, R-Truth, White Wedding, E-Pro, Solid, Psycho Killer,
2046129	2046489	Oh, sorry.
2047129	2047469	I'm sorry.
2047489	2048909	I meant Solid is the third stage.
2049090	2052550	So, Psycho Killer, Spirit in the Sky, Kids in America, Feel the Pain.
2052870	2053810	Oh, that's a good song, too.
2054210	2074834	Give It Away, Conventional Lover, A Jagged Gorgeous Winter, Bad Reputation, Pump It Up, You Oughta Know, Go Your Own Way, Welcome to the Neighborhood, and then Moderate is PDA, Shooting Star, Living on a Prayer, Deluxe, Girls Not Gray, One Way or Another, Tangled Up in Blue, Alex Chilton, Alive, The Middle, Aqualung,
2076134	2077135	Dude, Aqualung, cool.
2077615	2078236	Supreme Girl.
2078976	2094665	Challenging, we have Down with the Sickness, Give It All, Where'd You Go, Come Out and Play, Everlong, Pinball Wizard, that's also really cool, Rob the President, Testify, Uncontrollable Urge, Any Way You Want It, Round and Round, Night Lies, and then, what?
2094685	2098447	I was just going to say, thank you, Harmonix, for the journey.
2098708	2099048	I love you.
2100288	2104373	Nightmare Level, now I'm thinking of Doom, you know, was the last one, hurt me plenty.
2104994	2105214	Anyway.
2106676	2107477	But I don't want to die.
2109019	2117149	Let There Be Rock, Alabama Getaway, Lazy Eye, Teenage Riot, The Trees, Vault Edition, Carry On, Wayward Son, Rockin' Me, Ace of Spades 08.
2118192	2121514	I somehow missed that Carry On My Wayward Son is in that game.
2121795	2122915	That is awesome.
2123616	2124056	I'm sorry.
2124336	2124817	This is good.
2125257	2129139	I'm actually glad you're reading the whole list because I forgot about how some of these songs are in Rock Band 2.
2129179	2130160	It's going to be pretty awesome.
2130180	2131361	Yeah, that's why I just said to do the whole thing.
2131621	2132802	Spoon Man makes me happy.
2134183	2137825	You know, before Chris Cornell damaged his voice and doesn't sound as awesome as he used to.
2139006	2147692	Almost Easy, Chop Suey, Shacklers, Revenge, and then Impossible Mode is Master Exploder, Ramblin' Man, Shoulder to the Plow, Get Clean,
2149312	2158034	Colony of Birchmen, Peace Cells, Souls of Black, Battery, Panic Attack, Visions, Painkiller.
2158054	2159975	So, there you go.
2161075	2166336	Now see, the only bummer is that a lot of the songs I really want to play are not in the difficult category.
2166636	2168096	But that's okay, you know, I understand.
2168136	2173657	Because they want the difficult songs to be the more guitar, metal stuff that I don't really listen to usually.
2174078	2175338	But man, as a whole...
2176058	2178340	Master Exploder Master Exploder Master Exploder
2198513	2202839	I'm curious what you guys think about the Rock Band 2 song list and the difficulties.
2202860	2205644	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Laundry.
2205924	2209469	I'm kind of curious if people are actually going to call or if everybody's going to wait until the end like usual.
2209629	2211933	That's why this is an experiment tonight.
2213692	2214432	More Rock Band.
2214452	2219354	I mean, we just have a crap load of music game news tonight, especially, you know, as we're on the brink of a Rock Band 2 being released.
2219794	2221294	Lots and lots of music game news tonight.
2221895	2227296	And the details are finally out for how you are going to get your Rock Band 1 songs into Rock Band 2.
2227636	2229137	It is available to happen now.
2229277	2233118	Even though Rock Band 2 is not technically out yet, you can start the exporting process.
2233138	2241761	The whole process takes about 10 minutes, and it'll set you back $5, and it'll allow you to take 55 songs, take them out of Rock Band 1, and put them into Rock Band 2.
2242261	2243202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2266681	2267181	Thank you for watching!
2287315	2289115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2316981	2336657	and anything you've downloaded from before so that's that's gonna be a heck of a song list even though you know a lot of you have already played but that's neat I'm looking forward to that uh it is a bummer that they have to recharge you for that but I guess that's a licensing thing and there's just no way around it and admittedly five dollars not too bad not too bad
2339063	2345148	I got to do that quickly before Rock Band 2 comes out because you know there's going to be tons of people that are ripping the songs and then sell the game back.
2346048	2352513	I hope the game doesn't pull a gotcha and at some point you have to insert the original Rock Band disc or else we'll be screwed.
2353894	2356076	How about some Guitar Hero World Tour news?
2356176	2358637	This makes me happy because I'm a fangirl.
2360939	2365723	The latest who's going to be in the game as a playable character is Sting.
2366741	2370384	That makes me very, very happy because I was a big Police fan.
2372326	2380454	They're also supposed to be recreating Jimi Hendrix, Ozzy Osbourne, Zach Wilde, and Billy Corgan.
2380774	2382596	So that's pretty cool.
2382836	2388381	But you just have to find out, I guess, if anyone else is going to be in Guitar Hero World Tour when it comes out.
2388582	2388742	Yeah.
2391325	2391925	Guitar Hero Gorillaz Edition
2418169	2419710	I don't believe so.
2419890	2421831	I could be wrong, but I don't believe so.
2422331	2423231	We've had Radiohead.
2423331	2424992	I'm sure Chatwell will correct us if we're wrong.
2425372	2425612	Yeah.
2426233	2428113	I would love to see a Gorillaz edition.
2428694	2428854	Yeah.
2428874	2440599	You know what's pretty rad is that in Rock Band 1, when you're playing online, you get a random song that you play against your opponent with, which I wish Guitar Hero did so that way everybody didn't pick Through the Fire and the Flames.
2440959	2441920	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2469687	2470969	Betelbum is in Rock Band
2483308	2483908	I like that song.
2484229	2486570	Honestly, if I was gonna... Girls and Boys, hello.
2486670	2487370	No, no, no.
2487611	2490792	For just the guitar in it, because I'm sorry, even though he had to be an ass.
2491213	2500498	Graham Coxon is one of the, I would have to say, best guitar players out there, and I would love to have had Charmless Man in there.
2500898	2502860	Because the guitar in that would be really fun.
2504481	2507923	Bobby's in chat saying, I want to play Rock Band with Rob, and I also want to play Civ Rev with Rob.
2508003	2508363	Bring it!
2511325	2511946	Sivrev, Matthew Sweet
2527064	2554742	And this actually is a little bit older news, it came up last week, but Penny Arcade Expo was kind of distracting us Matthew Sweet is actually considering that he's going to be doing a lawsuit against Guitar Hero 2 He says, quote, I've been trying to see if I can get a lawsuit against them because they never asked to use the song A lot of kids have gotten into his music because of the inclusion of the song in the game Quote, I found out that the Romantics have a lawsuit going against the makers of that game because of the song What I Like About You
2555382	2558312	He says, I don't know if the Romantics are going to win their suit, but it's really weird.
2558353	2561664	I've never sued anyone in my life, and I don't think it would amount to much anyway.
2563815	2571837	So he's thinking about actually, even though he kind of admits more people get into the music, he wants to sue the people that did Guitar Hero for putting a song in there.
2572237	2574957	Although it was probably his record label that signed it away.
2575477	2576257	Doesn't make sense.
2576798	2583879	And honestly though, because I was actually, I don't know if you remembered, I was really surprised to see Matthew Sweet songs in there.
2583919	2588040	Because I've actually been a fan of Matthew Sweet since I was in high school.
2588980	2589500	Ever since...
2590820	2591360	No, I take that back.
2591400	2598165	Ever since college, because he did a couple of videos, one of them for a girlfriend that had clips from Cobra in it.
2598565	2599666	He's a big anime fan.
2599686	2600506	That's how I found out.
2600727	2605970	And also one with lots of Urasayatsura clips in the video.
2606050	2606610	I've been waiting.
2606690	2607311	That was the other one.
2608011	2634012	and on top of that I've been I picked up quite a number of his albums because I have my favorite album that he did is Altered Beast and he did one called Son of Altered Beast that has some of my favorite songs there so to hear that he's wanting to sue a video game company for promoting his music because I thought that me and five other people liked him that's just sort of ridiculous I think
2634949	2638251	Yeah, I mean, you can be a fan of someone and still admit, you know, smack, what are you thinking?
2638551	2639152	You know, right?
2639492	2644295	Like, if one of my favorite musicians was doing this, I would say, you know, I like you, but what are you thinking, dude?
2644895	2647316	And Ranma, yes, it was Space Adventure Cobra.
2649698	2653060	It was a lot of clips from the super uber long movie version.
2653840	2655121	Frisbee says sue someone.
2655161	2656101	It's the American way.
2657102	2658043	But here's the weird thing.
2658263	2661645	You know, Matthew Sweet references the romantics thing, but that was actually thrown out of court.
2662335	2663396	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2681332	2687357	You suing Guitar Hero will go over about as well as when Metallica sued Napster.
2687637	2690440	You can actually kind of understand why Metallica sued Napster.
2691080	2693862	But in this case, why so upset?
2693882	2695984	It gets more people into your music and so on.
2696024	2698926	Is he just upset he's not getting more money out of the whole thing?
2699427	2702129	If you sell CDs because of it, what's the big fucking deal?
2702489	2709873	Well, now we've spawned a whole Takahashi anime thing in chat because I happen to mention Urasayatsura.
2711694	2717597	And also, I think that Fire Tripper is a little better than some of those if you have to go for individual stuff.
2717737	2718037	The end.
2718858	2721259	By the way, that interview is from the North County Times.
2721299	2725361	If you want to check that out for yourself, nctimes.com did the interview on August 21st.
2726857	2727957	which was when we weren't here.
2728698	2736981	Hopefully he snaps out of it and doesn't end up suing the game because I think that would be a little silly and is just going to get a more negative publicity amongst the people playing this game than positive.
2737601	2743263	I think if he has issues with it, he needs to take it up with his record company or whoever signed on the dotted line and licensed this song away.
2743603	2748145	That is the person he needs to be going after if he doesn't want this to happen in the future, in my opinion.
2749125	2751686	Well, your opinion counts because you are an internet celebrity.
2751886	2752186	Mm-hmm.
2753466	2753766	Okay.
2754867	2755067	What?
2755936	2757657	I don't know if I'd say that, but okay, I'll take it.
2758138	2759859	Oh, come on, the internet is serious business!
2760660	2769266	Anyway, for something that... There is quite a bit of classic rock fans still left in the world.
2770347	2771608	I'm one, definitely.
2772088	2778113	But there are some classic acts that are going to be re-recording some master tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour.
2780434	2781875	Some of these are actually in...
2782984	2787106	I'd have to say MC5's Kick Out the Jams is going to be one.
2788387	2795251	They're actually having some help from Alice in Chains member Jerry Cantrell and Guns N' Roses' Gilby Clark.
2796611	2803295	Sex Pistols is putting up Pretty Vacant and Motorhead re-recorded Overkill.
2804175	2805696	I like Motorhead, by the way.
2806317	2807618	So I think that's pretty neat.
2808819	2817404	There also, though, was apparently a little bit of trouble with some of the tracks they were wanting to put in, so they're all working on trying to get the bugs ironed out.
2820326	2820566	Hmm.
2821127	2821847	Could be interesting.
2822168	2822588	I think so.
2822728	2823729	We'll see what happens with that.
2824902	2830426	Now, we've been talking a lot about music games, but let's not forget the music game that started it all, at least for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2830466	2839373	Dance Dance Revolution is still trucking along, and Hottest Party 2 and DDRX have gotten some more song announcements this week about some of the songs that you're going to find in the game.
2840213	2866744	Dance Dice Revolution Hottest Party 2 it's completely made up of covers but actually now there's also going to be some Konami originals in the game and those were some of the songs they announced this week for example we have Desert Journey by DJ Taka a new song that's going to show up in the game Terra, Kyoka Suigetsu Rou is coming out and if you want to look at the full list yourself ddronlinecommunity.com if you want to see some of the other songs that are going to be in the game
2868044	2873186	I do want to also mention the songs that are coming to DDRX on the PlayStation 2.
2873266	2874566	Some new licensed songs.
2874866	2875746	I thought this was interesting.
2875806	2879947	Naropa is coming back and the reason why that's interesting is because they're one of the different drum artists.
2880268	2882748	So now you have the different drum songs going on to PlayStation 2.
2883408	2886009	Feel is the song by Naropa that you're going to see in DDRX.
2886949	2888650	Some more new edits.
2889250	2890971	of old classic DDR songs.
2891011	2895872	Remember Butterfly and Dubby Dub were getting recut and re-edited for DDRX.
2895892	2896872	I don't know if you heard about that.
2897212	2899173	Some other songs got announced.
2899493	2900973	Hero is coming.
2901154	2901654	You know, remember?
2901954	2903194	La-da-dee-da-da.
2904394	2905455	You are my hero.
2907255	2907895	But no, get this.
2908516	2911376	Get Up and Move is also getting a new edit.
2911457	2912237	Remember S&K?
2912277	2913357	Get Up and Move.
2915218	2916318	That wasn't a good song.
2917403	2917643	Petshot Boys
2932888	2943336	Open from the Dub Pistols, synthesized from the punk label Fat Wreck Chords, the artist The Apixies was synthesized.
2943696	2944977	So it looks like a variety of music.
2945017	2948900	You have synth pop, punk, and bad music.
2949340	2950100	All different genres.
2950140	2950681	I'm just kidding.
2952188	2953929	Something for everyone in DDRX, it sounds like.
2953949	2955630	The bottom of the barrel of the Konami originals.
2955830	2956631	Yeah, exactly.
2956931	2958312	I'm trying to see if there's comments from chat.
2958352	2963635	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Some people are yelling out, get up and move.
2964276	2966917	Frisbee's remembering there was a sweet freestyle to it.
2967778	2970260	I bet there was some pretty awesome freestyle to that song, though, actually.
2971200	2975163	I've seen awesome freestyle done to really crappy songs, so...
2975680	2978961	Frisbee also says that they need to do the R21 patch for DDRX Arcade.
2979221	2981923	You know, I'm not thinking that's actually going to happen.
2982003	2983063	Needs more 2 Unlimited.
2984924	2985444	How about no?
2985464	2989606	2 Unlimited is like the quintessential jock jams band.
2989926	2990286	I guess.
2991906	2993406	We're in the Twilight Zone
3013632	3015833	Viva Pinata, Pocket Paradise, The Price is Right, The Game, Ubisoft
3038058	3039238	That makes you happy, doesn't it?
3039278	3040799	But it's not Bob Barker, is it?
3040899	3041939	Yeah, I don't know.
3042879	3044640	Some things just don't need to be made into games.
3044820	3046640	They need to do classic Price is Right for you.
3047020	3053082	Also that does not need to be made into games, Hell's Kitchen is coming out on the Wii along with the Price is Right port on the Wii.
3053122	3057963	And Hell's Kitchen also making its way to the DS shows just how easy games can go back and forth between the DS and the Wii.
3058443	3060704	If you're more of a PC gamer, guess what?
3060744	3065785	You get Romance of the Three Kingdoms Part 11 comes out this week on PC.
3066841	3069622	One would think that romance by now would be stale and dead.
3071103	3072583	They'd be on Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.
3072603	3073924	Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.
3074504	3076165	I know it means romance in the classical sense.
3076305	3080346	No, there are just rabid, rabid fans of that series.
3080446	3083948	And I think all the way back to when that series was on the NES.
3084028	3086669	Dude, I spent a lot of nights playing Nobunaga's Ambition.
3086929	3088129	Remember, those games were awesome.
3088609	3089170	They really were.
3089690	3091451	I think it's neat that they've lived on through all this time.
3092691	3096673	Maze of Fate DS, a new role-playing game coming out for the DS this week as well.
3097174	3101376	And Dragon Ball Z Trilogy, because you just can never have enough Dragon Ball.
3101977	3102997	It's coming out on the PlayStation 2.
3103297	3108601	Hey, and if you want some packaged games, CSI Super Pack on the PC.
3109021	3109841	Little known fact.
3110482	3113604	Well, maybe this isn't a little known fact, but sometimes overlooked fact.
3114344	3119427	The CSI games are designed by the same folks who are very popular for their recent Strong Bad game.
3119607	3120448	So something to think about.
3122056	3124978	If you're going to laugh off a CSI game, it might not be as bad as you think.
3125918	3126479	The more you know.
3126859	3131042	Oh, I did play the Strong Bad's cool game for attractive people.
3131482	3131982	Yeah, what'd you think?
3132462	3133563	It was pretty cool.
3133883	3135284	Especially with the 7-track player.
3135304	3139167	It said that it was short-lived because the faulty part of it was the on-switch.
3139587	3139807	Uh-huh.
3140668	3141168	There was none.
3143746	3148392	I gotta read some comments here from chat because they're making fun of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms thing.
3148813	3150655	TheRobD says, it needs to be like Madden.
3150916	3153379	Romance of the Three Kingdoms 09 with a new roster.
3154441	3158326	And GameGuru reminds us there has to be a marriage of the Three Kingdoms first for there to be a divorce.
3158586	3160249	That would have been part four.
3163663	3172009	It's using romance in an all-encompassing way because right now they're on the ongoing legal battle for custody of the Petuala.
3172649	3179434	And Quiltipo makes the mandatory joke, in-joke here, how long can Lube and Cow-Cow go at it?
3180274	3182216	That's what Quiltipo wants to know.
3182796	3183937	Oh, baby.
3186479	3187779	I know what game he's been playing.
3187839	3188500	All right, forget it.
3190729	3192010	So how about other news?
3192070	3192651	How about it?
3192811	3194072	More stuff!
3194312	3195993	And it's all coming out on the 12th.
3197394	3198115	At least in Europe.
3199376	3210664	We have GTR Evolution on PC, Baja on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and PS2, and R-Type Command on PSP.
3211044	3211685	And that's it!
3214711	3218393	Drive Thru, Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200, You Lose, Good Day Sir
3230489	3232510	Congrats, I guess.
3232630	3233411	Are they recognizing us?
3233431	3234071	Oh, no, it's a Thursday.
3234111	3234491	I'm sorry.
3234691	3235452	Are they recognizing us?
3235492	3235992	A holiday now?
3236372	3237553	No, I asked off that day.
3237593	3239374	So can you go to San Francisco and go to art galleries?
3239894	3240314	Oh, gotcha.
3240334	3241795	You know, that's actually Loki's birthday.
3242195	3242575	I know.
3242595	3244316	I think that might be part of the reason he's not here.
3244436	3251340	He might be at a little thing for his day job, but I think secretly he might be wanting to spend some birthday time with the wife because his birthday is actually September 11th.
3251380	3252641	You never forget when his birthday is.
3253261	3254882	Well, my birthday was the Waco thing.
3257100	3258640	So what tragedy happens on yours?
3259100	3260881	Actually, I did not get tragedy.
3260961	3262661	I had some good things happen on my birthday.
3262921	3265922	One, sodomy laws were abolished in Texas on my birthday.
3268162	3269902	My birthday was also the day before Hitler's birthday.
3270363	3273083	And I'd like to also point out Strom Thurmond died on my birthday.
3277884	3280004	Just saying, you know, you asked what happened on my birthday.
3280064	3280484	There it is.
3281725	3283085	Draw whatever conclusions you want.
3284605	3285426	Rob I like pie Do you?
3285446	3286847	Rob I'll kill you Guess what?
3304096	3306719	Alright, look, let's move to Japan and the release date's over there.
3306779	3311103	On Thursday, September 11th, Viva Piñata, Garden Wa Dai Punch.
3311403	3313706	You know that just here as Viva Piñata Part 2.
3314607	3315548	What's the subtitle for that?
3315568	3316008	I forgot.
3316689	3319412	It's Viva Piñata 2, Something in Paradise?
3319692	3322655	Yeah, there's a lot of people that are actually really into that game over here.
3322955	3324555	Punching people in the face in Paradise?
3325156	3327016	I've actually seen a lot of really positive reviews on it.
3327076	3328196	I might have to rent it or something.
3328216	3328976	Death to piñatas?
3329697	3331737	I don't think you can kill the piñatas yet.
3331797	3335958	Although I am waiting for the minigame where you finally take a baseball bat to your damn piñatas.
3337118	3338119	Have we had that happen yet?
3338139	3344080	And find that their guts are made out of, you know, Tootsie Pops and Jolly Ranchers.
3346650	3352533	TheRobD in chat says, I leave you to envision Sky celebrated the abolishing of sodomy laws with Strom Thurmond on his birthday yourself.
3353874	3355755	Let's just leave it to the imagination, folks.
3356616	3357396	Why do you have to go there?
3357856	3360258	Double Clutch comes out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.
3360338	3361639	Speaking of double entendres.
3362279	3364180	Infinite Undiscovery.
3364780	3367882	Wow.
3368142	3371104	These are all ways that you could celebrate the repeal of sodomy laws.
3371184	3372965	Double Clutch and Infinite Undiscovery.
3373025	3374786	There you go, coming out on the Xbox 360.
3377896	3381498	Also a brand new 360 console in 60 gigabyte flavor.
3382539	3385601	Coming out in Japan on the 11th on the PlayStation 3.
3385981	3392445	Double Clutch and Stranglehold makes its way as well to the PlayStation 3 on September 11th.
3392586	3394487	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
3395067	3401011	One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1 Nami ni Yoriyu Hiyohu is coming out.
3401051	3403933	That's a Namco game actually coming out.
3404991	3409654	Sega Ages 2500 Volume 33 Fantasy Zone Complete Collection Do you know how much this would cost you to import?
3429500	3431781	DarkTetsuya says, I think Sega heard that E all the way in Japan.
3431801	3433282	GS68 says, Jamie just fangasmed.
3458288	3459929	Can we get a mop in the studio, please?
3460129	3460529	Hey!
3461110	3466032	I actually held the microphone away from my face so that I didn't break anybody's eardrums.
3466753	3469814	So, you all owe me money now for saving you a medical expense.
3469994	3472155	Alright, and you know I love Princess Soft.
3472296	3477178	And Princess Soft is releasing a game called Sashu Shiken Kujira Alive.
3477398	3478419	Sweet, so sweet.
3478439	3480500	It's coming out from Princess Soft on the PlayStation 2.
3481120	3484302	Now we can visit the handhelds real quick and then we'll get back to some of the gaming news.
3484722	3486023	Rob likes the handhelds, don't you?
3486363	3490447	Spore Creatures is coming out on the DS as well.
3490487	3492409	It's just like, gosh, a bunch of other games.
3493510	3502678	Gakenmu Henshubu Kanshu Chojujinsu Research File comes out on the Nintendo DS as well, as well as some DS Vision games.
3504059	3505200	And a game called, what is this?
3506241	3508303	Hoshizora no Comic Garden.
3509905	3510585	I wonder if that's an anime.
3510605	3510706	Okay.
3511647	3514928	because it has a limited edition, usually limited edition games or games based on animes.
3515288	3517829	And on the PSP this week, nothing.
3519229	3519730	No games for you.
3519750	3520830	Your mom, the game.
3521450	3523211	Nothing for you on PSP, sorry to say.
3523271	3523611	Thank you.
3523891	3524331	Pull forward.
3524471	3528212	I'm adding that, by the way, to the list of official Orange Jones Radio wanted games.
3528452	3529073	Your mom, the game?
3529093	3529733	Your mom, the game.
3529753	3531053	What would you do in your mom, the game?
3535235	3535695	Zing.
3538476	3539336	Nice, nice.
3542482	3544463	You've caught me in a very weird mood.
3544683	3545264	Apparently.
3546124	3547345	How about more news?
3547485	3547865	How about it?
3547885	3550407	Because no gnoos is good gnoos with Gary Gnu.
3550627	3553089	And if none of you get that, then you're too young.
3553629	3554350	And I feel old now.
3554921	3581684	Eurogamer Expo Eurogamer is actually a very big, very popular site overseas and they carry lots of good news and have Eurogamer TV and I actually go to that site quite often but Eurogamer Network is having Eurogamer Expo and I've said Eurogamer a whole bunch of times in a row but it's at the Old Truman Brewery October 28th through 29th in London and
3583265	3588290	and there will be some more details up there but it will be two sessions each day 11 a.m.
3588330	3588950	to 4 p.m.
3589271	3589871	and 5 p.m.
3590151	3590992	to 10 p.m.
3591593	3605505	also I'm going to be playable there Street Fighter 4 Prince of Persia Mirror's Edge LittleBigPlanet Tomb Raider Underworld Far Cry 2 Fallout 3 Saints Row 2 and many more in other words all the shit we already played at PAX hey
3605885	3606365	Just kidding.
3606746	3607746	No, I think this is a great idea.
3607826	3609867	I'm just... Actually, we didn't get... I gotta haze a little.
3609887	3610047	Rob.
3610268	3610448	What?
3610468	3611768	We didn't get Street Fighter 4.
3612209	3613029	Alright, alright.
3613069	3614850	And I don't believe I saw any Prince of Persia.
3616771	3617432	I'm just messing.
3618792	3620133	So... Gotta get your feathers all ruffled.
3620153	3622514	We did get Velvet Assassin and that girl needed to eat too.
3624364	3639348	So at any rate, I would actually very much love for any of our European listeners, if you're going, write us up, review, take photos, get back, get some internet celebrity for yourself through our site.
3640408	3644369	Which hopefully we'll have our new site done by the time Eurogamer Expo happens.
3644649	3646390	I personally will be at a steampunk convention.
3646410	3651771	What do you think provoked the idea of a Eurogamer Expo?
3653437	3654798	Don't Really All They Have Is Leipzig
3675458	3678198	We went to... I liked Tap House, but it was too hot.
3678479	3679479	Yeah, Tap House was cool.
3679499	3680039	What was the other one?
3680059	3680379	Vons?
3680399	3680859	Vons.
3681099	3683940	Oh, yeah, like the supermarket chain here, but it's a bar up in Seattle.
3683980	3691901	They had taps from different breweries all over the wall, and they had big, bold letters on their banner outside.
3692441	3693821	We do not serve bud.
3694941	3697682	And I was like, this place is already fantastic.
3698602	3703483	And then they had really, really good food, and I tried some very interesting beer.
3704721	3705682	That was one of my favorite places.
3705722	3710609	We did not have... I gotta say, Seattle folks, we did not have a single bit of bad food up in Seattle.
3710769	3711330	I really didn't.
3711951	3713092	Y'all know how to eat.
3713252	3719521	We did eat some fairly... A couple places we went to were a bit more upscale than I think we were anticipating, but...
3719721	3721922	Still, I've eaten some shitty food here locally.
3722002	3726443	Look, I've eaten off the menu at Cheesecake Factory, which, you know, I don't enjoy their lunch at all.
3726463	3727683	They have good breakfast, though.
3727783	3730764	I don't think... You don't go to Cheesecake Factory for the food.
3730784	3731444	You go for the cheesecake.
3731924	3737326	But I had some great food in Seattle, which, ironically, there was a lot of people going to Cheesecake Factory in Seattle, but I was kind of like, what's the point?
3737366	3737926	You can eat that at home.
3737946	3739386	We went to the Sega World Grill, and that was cute.
3739406	3740407	Sega World Grill was great.
3741247	3743267	Best burger I've ever had and really good pizza.
3743988	3744388	So, anyway.
3744408	3744628	Good times.
3744748	3745188	Anyway, sorry.
3745228	3745568	Foodio!
3746448	3746968	Orange Launch Foodio.
3748410	3751735	Well, you know, we could eat some Foodio and play Halo 3.
3752496	3757142	Halo 3 Mythic was apparently spotted by some folks at Penny Arcade Expo.
3757583	3761368	Halo 3 Mythic showed up just before the Penny Arcade Expo official kickoff
3761728	3764809	I wonder if one of the press folks actually snuck a picture of that, what was going on.
3765109	3773072	But apparently, Halo 3 Mythic is something that was kind of poking through, maybe something that shouldn't be announced yet that's going to be coming out soon.
3773813	3778694	Apparently, Halo 3 Mythic only has a multiplayer-only menu, and it's version 1.2.
3780615	3781295	Thank you for watching!
3803550	3807112	Which has no gamer score, but is an achievement nonetheless.
3807673	3811896	If you want to see the full list of those, they are available on some various blogs out there.
3811956	3816078	They went originally on the Ascendant Justic Forum.
3816859	3817499	So check that out.
3820161	3820702	You Halo 3 fans.
3821584	3826446	Well, other things to check out that would definitely enable some Halo 3 action.
3826907	3832269	The Xbox 360 price cut is official, actually, as of the 5th of this month.
3832309	3836892	They've dropped the price of the 60GB to $299, and the Xbox 360 Arcade to $199, and the 360 Elite to $399.
3847538	3857629	Basically, I guess it's just going to pave the way for more sales, and I hope that they're not... I would think that they've gotten past where they were working at a loss on their consoles, don't you think?
3859451	3864376	They might still be taking a little loss, but I think for them to be price point under the Wii, it might just be worth it.
3865442	3889148	Seriously, and to be perfectly honest, and this is again my opinion, and a system is only as good as the games that are on it, as I've said many times, but I think that the Xbox 360 right now has the better library, and I think them dropping the price of the systems while keeping the titles where they are now is a very smart move and should definitely turn in a profit for them.
3889168	3890349	I think that's a very good idea.
3890689	3891389	Because honestly...
3892009	3892769	The games are great.
3893610	3896731	There's been very few things that I haven't really enjoyed playing on Xbox 360.
3897531	3899072	Who doesn't like Cheap?
3899952	3900212	Who?
3901133	3901553	No one.
3901793	3903613	The people that bought Yaris.
3905574	3905914	Zing.
3906234	3906795	Maybe that.
3907355	3908755	Really, that's it.
3909836	3910676	Who doesn't like Cheap?
3912837	3915278	I really like Cheap's cooking show on Parappa.
3918098	3929746	We'll see if the price cuts move more systems, which a lot of folks are forecasting that it's going to move big amounts of systems because there's going to be people to go in trying to get Wii's and folks aren't going to be able to get it, so they're going to get an Xbox 360.
3930987	3931328	We'll see.
3932388	3937012	Katamari's Forever in chat says, Oh no, now the Wii will have lower sales than the 360.
3938112	3940694	Really though, if you want Wii, you'll get Wii no matter what.
3940794	3941535	Scalper, anyone?
3943765	3946087	Misty says, I still say poopy on arcade.
3946467	3949070	Not enough storage space for my planned Rock Band downloads.
3949110	3949711	Very good point.
3950571	3958759	Even though the system might be cheaper than the Wii, it's not the greatest Xbox 360 system and I think there's going to be a lot of people out there that are going to find this out the hard way.
3959580	3963864	And then they have to fork over that extra $100 anyway a little later on for the hard drive.
3964025	3965106	That's going to be tough.
3966260	3987747	so we got one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week I can't stress this enough this is rumor and rumor only but apparently it's very interesting that this rumor is timed as soon after Penny Arcade Expo as it is and that rumor is that right now E3 the board behind E3 is in talks to make E3 public
3988587	3989008	Why not?
3989248	3993274	It's worked so well for Penny Arcade Expo, they are talking about making it public.
3993615	4003771	Apparently, the idea has officially been brought forward to the Entertainment Software Association, and that could mean as soon as next year, the show could be public.
4004764	4005685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4030723	4055829	Pax is an E3 and we've heard tons and tons of comparisons and that Pax is what everybody thought E3 was going to be when they heard about E3 and Pax is just all this stuff but just asking directly comparing the two shows since we've been fortunate to go to both and talking about old E3 and Pax at least I know what I noticed one thing I noticed people were way more laid back at Pax
4056348	4056928	It was great.
4057008	4058109	I thought it was fantastic.
4059730	4065354	With that level of... Keep in mind, you've got so many people in such an area.
4067155	4071979	Even as big as E3 was, there's going to be tensions running.
4072039	4075641	You've got a lot of professionals that have to get from appointment to appointment to appointment.
4076282	4079424	We had to do that, especially our last year at E3.
4079924	4082946	How many appointments did we set up trying to get interviews and visiting?
4083366	4083867	Exactly.
4084427	4084507	And
4086068	4113546	this without having because we didn't have to schedule interviews the developers were you know those who made it we're just there chatting about everything and being so open about about the games and letting everyone take pictures and not having all this crap especially screens people with a bug up their butt not letting you take pictures which they did this year here at PAX they were great about it but it was just so completely laid back everyone was friendly and even the enforcers I'd say they were all fantastic they did a great job and they were friendly and
4113686	4115267	They were very personable, the ones I dealt with.
4115407	4119449	Yeah, pardon my French, but everybody had to stick up their fucking ass at E3.
4120069	4123291	And that's always been kind of my problem with E3 is that people are very snobby.
4123311	4128734	I don't know if that's like the LA thing or what it is, but I don't like getting treated like shit at a video game expo.
4128754	4136218	And you've heard the stories I've told on this show about some of these big media gatherings that we've been to in the past and how we're looked down on because, you know, independent podcast.
4136238	4137238	They don't have millions of listeners.
4138759	4141140	And just like, there's a bunch... Whoa, I just threw something.
4141180	4141620	I'm so angry.
4142001	4142181	Um...
4143201	4169043	but you know people a lot of people have sticks at their ass not to say everybody is like that E3 there's some very cool people at E3 but at PAX everybody was awesome and developers are out there on the floor mingling with people like you know Loki played some game and I watched the people come up to him and say oh so did you like it and Loki was like you know yeah he was trying to be nice and give a positive answer and they they actually said what did you like about it what what what was cool about it to you I like they were asking for feedback
4169463	4172645	And you know that guy from Guitar Hero, and I apologize, I forgot his name.
4172705	4174686	He didn't have a business card to give me.
4174806	4178668	He talked to us for quite some time after the interview he did on All Games Radio.
4178688	4179468	He was very cool.
4179828	4184211	And he did confirm for me that there is no bonus peripheral for studio mode.
4184411	4184871	There you go.
4186112	4188493	But it was very cool.
4188533	4189213	People were just hanging out.
4189233	4192155	And the guy from Warhammer Online was hilarious when we had him on the show.
4192415	4196077	And then I saw him later on the show floor, and he was just hanging out, chilling, showing off the game.
4197196	4199137	People are so much more laid back at PAX.
4199337	4202138	I ran into my DM again and he waved at me.
4203599	4208161	If they put it on the floor at PAX, they realize the pictures are going to be all over the internet.
4208422	4214184	People have finally kind of gotten over it and they don't try to control it so much at PAX because they realize it's a gamer thing.
4214605	4218126	So if E3 is going to take that step, that's a big step for E3.
4219687	4221408	A lot of people are going to have to change their attitudes.
4221428	4221928	Capcom.
4224690	4225110	Just saying.
4225836	4231164	You know, I still didn't have, I think, quite the problem that you guys had at E3.
4231805	4239215	But I think that, you know, a lot of it has to do with... I'm just saying, look who didn't go to PAX.
4240337	4240517	Yeah.
4242559	4245102	Some people can't handle it, I guess.
4245142	4246383	Pax is too cool.
4247364	4254731	Anyhow, we actually asked this question on our pre-OLR twit on our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR at us on Twitter.
4254751	4257133	There's been quite a few people to have this week, so thank you guys very much for that.
4257373	4261457	And we hope you enjoyed the updates from Jamie's iPhone at Penny Arcade Expo.
4261937	4267763	I was in charge of the... And sometimes the pictures didn't attach with the text I included, so oops.
4267783	4267943	Oops.
4268083	4268883	Thank you for watching!
4286252	4287493	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4308072	4310133	I mean, a lot of other expos are public, so why not?
4310213	4312654	As long as you pay for a pass and follow the rules, fair game.
4313034	4314795	Quiltipo says, Capital idea.
4314915	4316675	I've always wanted to meet D-list celebrities.
4317456	4320056	Because remember, E3 went under because of Paris Hilton and stuff.
4320257	4322057	But even PAX had their D-list celebrities.
4322437	4325579	I mean, you know, if you consider Jonathan Colton, Will Wheaton, Freeze Pop.
4325599	4327799	But we had cool people there.
4328180	4328640	That's true.
4329160	4330841	People that actually cater to the nerd crowds.
4331261	4333482	We had people there who worked for their fame.
4333762	4335962	To be fair, E3 did have Adam West.
4336803	4337223	To be fair.
4342794	4346136	Also, I want to point out, MistyOLR responded and said, Public?
4346436	4349218	You mean it wasn't public enough with all the loopholes that got exploited?
4350079	4353801	She says, Bad idea, I think, especially with your report of the last E3 you went to.
4355002	4359705	Actdeft says, Considering the success of Penny Arcade Expo, I think they want to emulate that to redeem themselves.
4359785	4360966	I do hope they get it right, though.
4361687	4363848	I apologize if I managed to announce this name.
4364348	4365409	Giovedia?
4365829	4367330	G-I-O-V-E-D-E-A?
4367671	4368071	Giovedia?
4369622	4370103	Oh, my bad.
4371043	4375427	Says, bad idea for the whole time, but good idea to open it public for a day.
4375787	4377568	It's an industry expo, not a convention.
4377809	4382332	And you know, that's something I've heard a lot, is make it more like Tokyo Game Show, where it's closed for one day, but open for the rest.
4382352	4383333	And I think that would be fair.
4383653	4384874	I think a good conclusion.
4385795	4390178	And DR of War C, I think that might be Doctor of Warcraft or something like that?
4390198	4390498	I don't know.
4390538	4393821	DR of War C says, screw E3 going public.
4394141	4395622	PAX is the new thing in town.
4396103	4398585	But really, it wouldn't hurt to have the two West Coast shows.
4398945	4400066	Forget E for No One.
4401307	4401767	Hey, wait a minute.
4401787	4402727	I'm going to E for No One.
4402767	4403028	Come on.
4403448	4404509	It might actually be kind of cool.
4404529	4405469	You never know what might happen.
4406990	4412974	Again, if you want to get the pre-OLR twits and respond to a story before the show goes live, check us out on Twitter.
4413054	4413574	Our username?
4413934	4414475	OLR.
4414995	4416236	Really hard to remember, I know.
4417182	4417723	Really difficult.
4418063	4422248	Alright, we are about to go to... Ranma says, you butcher Japanese and Italian.
4422589	4423349	Yes, I do.
4423510	4428556	Look, foreign language was my one weakness in high school, if it's not completely obvious here on the show, okay?
4429156	4430198	So, there you go.
4430518	4431639	Komo Te Lama.
4432100	4432620	Alright, uh...
4436041	4437802	Dark Sakura, what should all the kids be playing this week?
4457808	4463533	The game of the week is actually quite the obscure little title called Puzzle and Descent.
4463994	4476705	Which, um, also if you happen to find the name actually written in Japanese text, the first part of it's in Katakana and the last part's in, no, the first part's in Hiragana and the second part's in Katakana, which is very weird.
4476885	4482631	But anyway, it's a little puzzle game where you're this guy with a pointy hat who looks like a naked gnome.
4485576	4488063	It's the Travelocity gnome with no pants.
4489269	4496012	The game itself plays sort of like a combination of Pango, Columns, and Bomberman.
4496893	4508098	And the publisher on this game, for those who actually keep up with putting that on the wiki, is Nichibutsu Nihon Busan.
4508719	4511200	It was actually released on April 14, 1995.
4511860	4516843	And I almost bought a copy at PAX, but I didn't.
4518364	4524948	But anyway, the way that it works is you've got these four different colored blocks and you have to make all of them touch.
4525048	4529671	However, if three of them touch, then they vanish.
4529931	4536075	And you may actually lose the entire puzzle in the time limit that you're given because you haven't made all the blocks vanish.
4536876	4547323	And I'm actually, because it is that weird and obscure, I'm going to be linking one of the images into the chat room so that they can see what it's like.
4549344	4564697	and honestly if you can people are playing emulators just freaking download it already it's a really fun little game but keep in mind as you get further and further into the game it actually comes up a bit more like Super Silkeban if anyone's played that
4565257	4591828	and you have such a massive challenge on trying to get your blocks touching basically you have to shove them in position but as you go further you'll get some with percentage marks on them that are immobile you get ice blocks that will dissipate when they touch another object you have arrow blocks which you can only push in the direction that they're pointing you've also got a
4593129	4596414	Block, because you can actually play multiplayer.
4596754	4600559	You can block other people from making different moves.
4601280	4605886	And then you've got teleport blocks that you can move them around.
4606347	4607549	So it's just very...
4608790	4611314	Very interesting little game.
4611915	4614279	It gets very, very challenging.
4615020	4618606	And it's definitely one, if you like a game, that makes you think a little bit.
4618706	4622712	But it is only... You cannot play against the computer.
4622792	4623514	It's only against...
4624054	4625134	and many more.
4646914	4649857	I know, I want to say I've played a game like this too, and I don't know what the hell it is.
4651179	4652200	But it drove me nuts.
4652260	4652860	It's hard.
4652921	4653942	This is a hard game.
4654442	4656765	But I will put the name of it in the chat room so they can look it up.
4657806	4661289	or you can actually look at the same YouTube I'm looking at here, Puzzle and Desu.
4661469	4662089	D-E-S-U.
4662489	4663550	Very easy to spell.
4663650	4663830	Yeah.
4664170	4665311	I just want to put the name in.
4665952	4669114	And we'll link the, if you want to, since you've got it up, if you'll link that in the chat room.
4669514	4669754	Sure.
4670334	4671055	But it's really fun.
4671415	4676198	And remember, if you want to see these links as they show up, you've got to listen live to us on Sunday nights.
4676519	4683583	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com to join our chat room and AllGames.com is where we're broadcasting every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific time.
4683603	4686085	There it is, your classic game of the week, Puzzle and Desu.
4687301	4689162	Very simple game that will drive you nuts.
4690403	4695567	No calls during Part A. I guess people don't like the whole, or they're just not used to it, the whole calls during the show thing.
4696007	4698730	So we'll just have to open it up at the end of B like usual.
4699190	4700211	So much for that experiment.
4700951	4701872	Now we'll try new things.
4701892	4702492	Call us!
4702973	4704274	Nah, I already shut it off for now.
4704394	4716623	No, Colton, come back on Part B. No, we're already an hour 20 for Part A, so we gotta take a break so we can get to Part B. Alright, we'll get on Part B. Don't worry, we'll have time for calls in Part B. It's just folks are used to the end of the show.
4717682	4718104	So we'll do that.
4718124	4719248	We're going to take a quick break.
4719288	4722419	We'll be back though with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after a quick break.
4722519	4723081	We'll see you then.
4732547	4737492	Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here from Orange Lounge Radio with an important message.
4738232	4743837	Every year thousands of yellow wizards are about to die from a horrible outbreak, food shooting.
4744518	4749342	Shooting food causes the loss of life in many red warriors and green elves across the planet.
4749923	4754768	Elf needs food badly, so please think twice before shooting food this holiday season.
4755289	4763218	The Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault.
4763799	4766142	Remember, don't shoot food.
4772307	4775651	There are a couple of other things I just tell you when I remember.
4776473	4777514	He's crazy.
4777754	4783682	If you could not see the similarities in the personalities within like the first couple of episodes, you need brain surgery.
4783922	4784403	I mean, seriously.
4784683	4784783	Slap.
4789229	4789750	How?
4789910	4791672	You have to hit me so hard.
4791692	4792753	It wasn't that hard.
4792873	4797699	Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your hosts DJ Ranma S and Kuro Usagi.
4797759	4803326	Log on to DJRanmaS.net slash Anime Jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.
4804830	4809895	Hi, I'm Gsteel, and I just wanna say that you are all losers for listening to video game quote, music.
4810475	4813158	Music from video games is just a bunch of beeps and blips.
4813738	4820024	I don't understand how people say music from say, Final Fantasy, Streets of Rage, or Maximum Twin's music.
4820584	4823127	It's from video games and therefore talentless garbage.
4823767	4826970	Using Koshiro and Nubo Uematsu can partake of my genitalia.
4827591	4830834	Video games' life can go to hell from making a big deal out of electronic beeps.
4831374	4834856	Go listen to real music because music that has no tolerance needs to be banned.
4835196	4835996	K-Things 5.
4836477	4836797	P.S.
4837097	4841099	This PSA is brought to you by La Milana, home of the never-ending Hell Temple music.
4842439	4843440	Gaming Radio.
4843660	4848642	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
4849023	4850583	Orange Lounge Radio.
4855219	4872479	Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 7th, 2008 For our 293rd episode, if you can believe it There was a little boo-boo in the numbering of the podcast last week And some folks think they got episode 291 twice But no, it was just misnumbering, an error on my part Shoot me
4873806	4875627	Remember, don't shoot Rob.
4875907	4876967	Rob is not food.
4877768	4878928	Not with us tonight, of course.
4878968	4881469	Techmaster Loki is out for the night, but that's okay.
4881509	4885290	It's DarkSakura and myself feeling the love, but just platonically.
4885491	4885811	Thank you.
4886171	4886611	She's married.
4886651	4886971	I'm gay.
4887491	4887771	All right.
4888572	4890452	You guys are filling in as the co-hosts tonight.
4890492	4894134	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have some things you want to say.
4895355	4898697	Some folks commenting on the various commercials there that were being played during the break.
4899038	4900159	Having to recycle a little bit.
4900219	4905663	If you have some promos that you want to have played during our free break, send them on in to us.
4906123	4907304	Rob at OrangeLaundry.com.
4907324	4908145	You can send me an email.
4911087	4916212	Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some gaming news this week with some news on the PSP.
4917597	4919138	Sony PSP and PlayStation 3
4934446	4935427	And you can do that.
4935467	4939749	That will be happening this fall in Japan, but probably is going to inevitably happen over here as well.
4939769	4941510	I mean, if there's money to be made, why not?
4942711	4946613	Sony, by the way, is also going to be launching a new infrastructure mode.
4947233	4950075	This is something that happens when you connect the PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3.
4951996	4973099	and you can do this all wirelessly and then what happens is that you can actually do some type of like multiplayer modes through a PlayStation 3 connection for some games so you kind of use your PlayStation 3 as like a hub to kind of do wireless stuff between the PSP which is kind of interesting could be interesting to see what they do with that but certainly there's been a lot of love between the PSP
4973439	4975141	PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation 3.
4975521	4977483	So it's very neat to see those two work together.
4978284	4985170	In a way, it seems like Nintendo's just catching up in that regard with the whole DS demos finally making their way to the Wii just a couple months ago.
4986051	4986771	We've been waiting.
4987472	4988233	Huh, nice.
4989544	4996729	I'll tell you other things that we've been waiting for, at least people who are fangirls like me or fanboys not like me because I'm a girl.
4998890	5006494	Of course, we all knew that Kingdom Hearts was going to be a PlayStation 3 exclusive and there's going to be something about that at Tokyo Game Show.
5009776	5011758	Well, really though, it's a rumor.
5013081	5040318	but, you know, we won't know unless we hear something official from Tokyo Game Show but I honestly though, given that Kingdom Hearts has already been pretty much strictly well, except for the DS version which doesn't count but seeing that Sony's been pretty much sticking sorry, Squeenix has been sticking with Sony for this franchise for the most part I wouldn't be surprised if it's going to be a PS3 exclusive so, we'll see
5041650	5044012	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5061008	5061489	and DarkSakura.com.
5083323	5083964	What's up with that?
5084164	5085325	I go places without Dan.
5086285	5088447	He's not too happy about it, but I do.
5089548	5089868	All right.
5090529	5091230	All right.
5091290	5093592	Back to video games and the real world and so on.
5093652	5094532	No, that's cool.
5094572	5095593	Hope he has fun wherever he goes.
5095814	5097795	But he better not miss another Sunday or he's so fired.
5098196	5098616	No, I'm kidding.
5099016	5099276	All right.
5100649	5103150	PlayStation Network games also going to be simulaunched in the UMD form
5124922	5131147	Sony Computer Entertainment of Europe is actually going to be releasing collections of PlayStation Network titles that are going to be on UMD.
5131807	5136291	There's the Power Pack, which is going to have the games Flow, Syphon Filter, Combat Ops, and Beats.
5136591	5140314	And the Puzzle Pack will include Lemmings, Go Puzzle, and Go Sudoku.
5140574	5149322	So for those of you that didn't feel like getting the games on the PlayStation 3, or you've still been too cheap to get a PlayStation 3, now you can get these on UMD for the PlayStation Portable, which I think is kind of interesting there.
5150783	5151784	It's kind of interesting that...
5152364	5156407	There's still that cohesiveness between PlayStation 3 and PSP.
5156467	5167996	I think that's kind of interesting that the titles are so... I know we joke a lot about the DS and the Wii getting a lot of the same ports, but I mean, for real, you're seeing the exact same games, exact same thing, going between the PSP and the PlayStation 3.
5168236	5169117	It's kind of interesting.
5169657	5171639	So you'll be able to check that out in Europe.
5172139	5177523	Honestly, I imagine if it sells well over there, it's probably only a matter of time before that stuff comes out over here.
5177563	5179845	I mean, where there's money to be made, right?
5179865	5180145	Right?
5181412	5181733	We'll see.
5181873	5184214	Well, that's pretty much the way that it works, isn't it?
5185455	5188477	Well, at any rate, we do have some other news.
5189498	5194342	We also have some information about a little big planet.
5194362	5197584	It's supposed to be having a limited public beta this month.
5198164	5199345	And I think that's pretty cool.
5201147	5205730	There's no other details about it, but they said you'll be able to sign up for it.
5206050	5211655	It just doesn't say how or when or well, but it will be made public right before the test is to be launched.
5212335	5215177	They also do have an invite-only method.
5216518	5219381	But they said they'll be large enough that people around the world will be able to have fun with it.
5219401	5220601	Is that like a Gmail thing?
5220621	5222623	Remember when Gmail invites were very rare?
5222683	5223864	Or wait, no, no, no, LiveJournal.
5224004	5226606	Remember when you got one invite code for LiveJournal?
5226786	5227046	Yeah.
5227167	5227647	Remember that?
5228095	5229076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5257765	5258065	DJ Max DJ Max
5283206	5285009	DJ Max Games coming out.
5285049	5288413	Pentavision has announced they are coming out with two new titles.
5289454	5294581	Pardon me for horribly mispronouncing these names, but there's Klaziquil Edition and Black Square.
5294841	5295702	I know I got that one right.
5296303	5299868	Pentavision is actually going after both the hardcore and the casual gamers.
5300669	5301229	It's not really...
5301750	5302450	Thanks for watching!
5321001	5321301	BlackSquare
5338439	5338699	Maybe.
5339580	5344622	Some folks in chat room are definitely feeling pretty hardcore about this.
5344683	5347104	Gsquared68 is a fan of the game and says, Wait, what?
5347424	5348825	Oh, they're probably just limited editions.
5349085	5352047	They need a feature that tracks percentage and not just score.
5352427	5355589	Scoring system equals combo based equals epic fail.
5356069	5357890	But Actdeft says, Yay, DJ Max.
5359451	5359851	So there you go.
5361175	5378585	Well, in other PlayStation news, and this should make some of our European listeners happy, is that there will be randomly selected PS3 owners in Europe who will be able to get the demo of Motorstorm Pacific Rift, which was only exclusive to the U.S.
5379045	5381947	for people who bought copies of Core on PSN.
5383207	5384068	For any of...
5386438	5403482	The, uh, basically for any of the players in Europe who also, I do believe, purchased the game, it will be available, and it's supposed to include the Airzone track, so you can give it a try, and it has support for single player and two player split screen, so it'd be cool.
5405042	5408423	And actually, it's supposed to be free for a few days before the official release.
5409758	5410958	Motorstorm 2 is very pretty.
5411218	5416119	It was a very popular demo, so I didn't get to get my hands on it, but it looked very pretty from what I noticed.
5416779	5419540	I like the jungle scape much more than the dirt of the first one.
5421160	5425881	I think the jungle was a much better setting for the game, although I would like to see, I don't know if it's too much to ask for a game with a little more diversity.
5426321	5427482	Give us some jungle and some dirt.
5427842	5428962	Those are the great racing games.
5429002	5430162	Even Excite Truck did that.
5430922	5431202	Dirt.
5432042	5432423	Exactly.
5432803	5436963	Well, guess what game you get to experience all over again.
5439184	5439424	Well,
5444690	5446653	That's right, all over again.
5446793	5453242	As if the PC wasn't enough, and the PSP wasn't enough, and the Xbox 360 wasn't enough.
5454605	5458907	You get to get Shinin' and Luminous, and your mobile phones weren't enough.
5459287	5462869	You get to do this all over again on the PlayStation Network.
5462909	5471354	That's right, Luminous Supernova was announced for the PlayStation Network this week, and it is the same game you know and love, but with some new stuff.
5471374	5475135	You know there's going to be some new skins, some new songs, and some new modes.
5475176	5476816	They've announced Dig Down mode.
5477357	5481979	You use the falling blocks to erase squares from the playfield that already has blocks on it.
5482299	5482579	Mr. Driller!
5482599	5482699	No.
5482739	5483259	I'm joking.
5505444	5506065	Spice World was a crabby game
5524252	5525113	So there you have it.
5525753	5528916	Supernova, 40 unlockable skins in challenge mode.
5529257	5533701	Also, of course, skin edit, time attack, puzzle mission modes, two-player versus mode.
5534021	5545031	No release date set yet, and it's not known if it's going to take the microtransaction approach that made this game so controversial on the Xbox 360, where you only buy the base game and then have to buy everything separate.
5545091	5546512	My gut tells me no.
5547193	5547633	Is it Ness?
5547693	5548034	Is it Ness?
5571730	5573931	It's not net, it's Earthbound-like.
5574011	5577451	I don't know, I only say that because it's a little kid wearing a baseball cap, so it reminds me of that.
5577811	5578352	But there you have it.
5579472	5581832	So, yeah, it's going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.
5582973	5588754	I'm kind of not interested because whatever they put in this game will be recycled into Luminous 3, which I'm sure is inevitable.
5588934	5591815	Or they'll release this yet another microtransaction for Xbox Live Arcade, I bet.
5592475	5594695	And honestly, the well mode doesn't sound that interesting.
5595016	5596356	Sequencer mode sounds okay.
5596696	5598356	I'd like it better if you could use your own songs.
5599857	5601017	Maybe, someday, maybe.
5601633	5601913	Who knows?
5602953	5620797	Alright, well every week here on Orange Lounge Radio we allow you guys to interact with us, not just through the chat room and the phone calls, but your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and every week DarkSakura digs into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite emails and reads them for you live here on Orange Lounge Radio and I'm sure the email's been collecting as we were away at PAX.
5621317	5621777	Kinda.
5621917	5622777	So let's get to it.
5622837	5625818	I don't know if she has time to read them all, but she'll at least do some of her favorites tonight.
5626498	5627759	I can read most of them.
5628759	5633780	Hey OLR, ever since 2006, I was very excited for the Wii since it came out.
5634160	5635481	I purchased one early 2007.
5635741	5637941	I had to work to pay it off all summer.
5638582	5642803	I bought all the big Nintendo titles and played each of them for about 20 hours until I got stuck.
5643223	5644564	Then I got an Xbox 360.
5644664	5645664	They are incomparable.
5646065	5649507	The Xbox 360 has good online experience and great high-definition graphics.
5649967	5653809	After watching Nintendo's press conference, I have completely lost hope.
5654309	5656991	Obviously, Nintendo doesn't need to do anything for us.
5657051	5664895	Long story short, my Wii is ending today on eBay, and I'm hoping to get a lot from it, seeing as how it still is in demand.
5665316	5667177	Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts.
5667557	5668878	Here is spelled H-E-A-R...
5670058	5671039	Here are your thoughts on this.
5671219	5672139	Love your show, keep it up.
5672159	5674821	By the way, my name is Dan and my gamer tag is DanThe3rd.
5675461	5676241	Okay, you have a good name.
5679323	5680524	That's up to you.
5680584	5681584	I'm not getting rid of my Wii.
5681984	5683985	I still have stuff on that that I like to play.
5684606	5686407	Stuff on 360 I like to play.
5688147	5690869	It just really depends on what type of things that you like.
5690989	5693530	I mean, there's stuff on PS3 that I like to play.
5694611	5694671	It...
5695267	5701734	You know, it's been a little while since we've reiterated the golden rule of gaming for our listeners, so why don't we remind the listeners of what the golden rule of gaming is.
5701915	5704498	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
5705971	5706812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5729249	5733950	So I'm going to hang on to my Wii because I want to try it out because it might actually be pretty cool with the internet in the room speak thing.
5734250	5734770	We'll see.
5735231	5735851	Time will tell.
5736811	5746053	But I wouldn't know if I sold my Wii back in a panic and they might be even harder to get when you want them again or you might think you make a profit off it now but it's a risky game.
5746353	5747294	It's a risky game to play.
5748034	5753975	But at the same time, if you're not enjoying your Wii and you're never playing your Wii and you don't think there's anything in the future, then sell it.
5754415	5755936	Some other family probably really wants it.
5755976	5756356	Why not?
5757176	5760059	Make some money off it, but realize I've seen people do this.
5760579	5766865	I've even seen a good friend of mine do this where he'll get a system, sell it back, buy the same system six months later, sell it back, buy it again.
5766966	5768127	I'm just kind of like, what are you thinking?
5768167	5770469	You're losing so much money doing that.
5770549	5774693	If you think something's going to come out on it that you want to play in the future, hang on to it.
5775354	5776475	You'll save money in the long run.
5778143	5781024	Next email up, and this is regarding Evangelion, actually.
5781184	5785805	Hi, I have a friend that is obsessed with Evangelion, and I was wondering if there are any good games from that series.
5786005	5786765	The answer is no.
5787785	5793847	Unless you like playing the dating sim kind, and then I've got, there was, you know, the Saturn ones that came out.
5793887	5801469	I think there was one on Nintendo 64, and there most recently came out one, I want to say on PS2, was it?
5802748	5803789	I don't seek out these games.
5803809	5806751	They're still making Eva games, so just look online.
5806771	5808012	The Pachinko game is the best one.
5808572	5808912	Go for that.
5809072	5812154	Anyway, he says he is learning Japanese, so importing is not a problem.
5812875	5813135	Okay.
5814356	5817778	If it has that crazy intro theme from the anime, it gets bonus points.
5818899	5819459	Sure, they all do.
5819659	5820100	They all do.
5820580	5827184	In fact, I can tell you from experience that at least one of the Saturn ones has a full opening like it was an episode.
5827865	5829566	It's set up like an episode, basically.
5831806	5835330	I would make him ask for himself, but I'm still working on converting him to OLR goodness.
5835750	5837012	You guys and Gal are great.
5837532	5841196	You're funny, kicks my brain, and I enjoy it every week via podcast.
5841236	5842317	Someday I will listen live.
5842337	5843799	That is not a threat, it's a promise.
5844700	5845000	P.S.
5845080	5846562	DarkSakura, why do you hate Ayanami?
5847002	5850946	Because she's boring and has the personality of a bedsheet.
5851787	5853068	and Asuka could kick her ass.
5853288	5854929	I have no idea what you're talking about, but it's funny.
5855609	5857710	She's a clone girl with no personality.
5858190	5858710	PPS.
5859351	5860912	I hope I avoided the grammar attack.
5860992	5861692	That was scary.
5863273	5863713	Well...
5868294	5869834	You did okay.
5870135	5872775	Let me distract the Grammar Nazi, DarkSakura, with some chat comments.
5872895	5879397	The last email generated a lot of chat comments talking about the kids wanting to sell back his Wii.
5879437	5882018	Skylark in chat says, Fuck my Wii.
5882318	5883538	I haven't played it in four months.
5883718	5884538	Can't sell it, though.
5884598	5885379	Spent $300 on virtual console.
5888385	5891267	Then again, I've probably bought a lot on that too.
5891847	5894288	Skylark also continues to say, only good for a party environment.
5894748	5896689	TheRobD says, some other family wants it.
5896769	5897770	Think of the children.
5898170	5899031	Sell your Wii.
5900351	5902272	Is anyone thinking of the children?
5902873	5906094	Actdeft would like to point out that bed sheets are warm and sometimes comfy.
5906635	5908256	That's only when worn by other bodies.
5910777	5914299	She has the personality of a stalactite.
5918188	5921893	Xenovore, Yes I Eat Aliens, Munch Munch, Crunch Crunch, Slurp Gulp Happy
5935472	5936292	DarkSakura++
5951323	5951903	Oh, thank you.
5952824	5953644	Next email.
5955565	5959146	I think it's time to check how the Eye of Judgment is doing in sales, don't you?
5959766	5962727	I listen to you guys to put me to sleep.
5964208	5964948	No, you're not that boring.
5964968	5965588	Hey, wait a minute.
5965688	5966268	Let me finish.
5966408	5967149	No, you're not that boring.
5967189	5968809	It's just more entertaining than music.
5969330	5971830	And I have not heard anything on the Eye of Judgment.
5972030	5973411	Is it just me or did you forget?
5973751	5975172	Sincerely yours, Richard, a.k.a.
5975212	5976312	The Doctor, a.k.a.
5976552	5978133	XGC The Doctor, a.k.a.
5978173	5978773	That One Guy.
5980057	5982138	Okay.
5982359	5985080	Look, it's not going to sell a million.
5985321	5989924	I hate to break it to you, but I will look up the numbers right now while DarkSakura reads the next email.
5990384	5991024	Hey, OLR.
5991304	5992465	Tybon here from Kenya.
5993106	5996668	I haven't been able to take a picture of Samara's Cafe yet, but the pic is coming.
5997128	6002652	I finally bought a Nintendo DS, so I'm looking for some recommendations on some RPGs I should import for the system.
6003312	6006174	Sorry for the shortness of my email, but I'm typing this out on my iPhone.
6006534	6008296	Thanks for the read on your show, Tybon...
6010336	6010916	I can't pronounce it.
6010936	6013037	Yeah, how are those iPhone sales doing in Kenya?
6013517	6014937	They're all over the place.
6015497	6018358	This message is brought to you by Kenya, home of the never-ending mud walls.
6018778	6019058	P.S.
6019078	6020358	This isn't my email address.
6020398	6021418	I was banned from Gmail.
6022159	6023839	You can't get banned from Gmail.
6024079	6025779	The guy is following me on Twitter.
6025879	6026499	It's a lie.
6026639	6027960	Admit why you are lying.
6028380	6029180	Why do you do this?
6030280	6031100	I just think it's funny.
6031680	6032201	I know, I know.
6033001	6034361	Get the world ends with you.
6035097	6036699	I have judgment.
6037760	6036699	220,000.
6038601	6039021	22 million.
6039061	6041504	So you're just over one-fifth of the way there.
6042145	6043146	Final Fantasy VI.
6043887	6047611	And then watch out for the Kenyans because they run really fast, according to that one commercial.
6048472	6049913	Okay, next email.
6050894	6051694	How goes it?
6051914	6052275	It goes.
6052995	6057837	So yeah, I tried to make some sense when typing, but I'm horrid with punctuation and grammar in general.
6058237	6058657	Uh-oh.
6059117	6061719	It's not something... This is the one that I sort of savaged before.
6062139	6068181	It's not something I really picked up on and was in trouble a lot as a kid when you were supposed to learn all that stuff.
6068601	6070762	Well, that being said, it's me, Glider, a.k.a.
6070802	6073263	the 56K-er, just had a few things to mention.
6073703	6075564	A little bit pissed about digital life this year.
6075604	6079466	I've been going to the... For the past few years, gonna miss it this year, but oh well.
6080186	6085310	Speaking of Jet Set Radio, one of my personal faves, another unusual skating game that was on PlayStation 2, Yaya Cabalista.
6086811	6087791	Okay, City Skater.
6088312	6091814	I played the crap out of it and was good very close to Jet Set Radio.
6091914	6095396	It could use a little skateboard that you put on an analog stick and held the controller sideways.
6095416	6097017	Very painful on the thumbs, but nonetheless fun.
6097698	6100239	I'm really good at reading run-in sentences, aren't I?
6103261	6104943	Yes, I remember what else I was going to say.
6105023	6105423	Rob!
6105443	6105503	Rob!
6107051	6110054	He put it all in caps, so I had to say it that way.
6110254	6112216	I heard you crack the dial-up joke.
6112556	6121724	The 56k has been my handle for almost 15 years now, so I'm not giving it up, even though I do have high-speed broadband 20 megabytes down and 8 megabytes up.
6122105	6125948	It's about average these days.
6126068	6131533	But real quick, I did used to use shotgun to 56k modems, you know, sync them and dial out.
6131793	6134074	to different services with the same login.
6134394	6137515	But it's also a good way to blow out your MOBO and modems.
6138095	6139496	Look, at least you're not the 300 bodder.
6139636	6144398	Okay, because when I was on the Commodore 64 back in the day calling BBSs, 300 bod, yo.
6144418	6144558	300 bod.
6148300	6149300	Anyway, keep up the good work.
6149320	6150041	Catch you guys later.
6150121	6150481	P.S.
6150521	6153101	Jamie, I'm really trying to have better grammar and punctuation.
6153181	6154042	Please, please don't eat me.
6154742	6155282	You know what?
6157463	6161164	Just remember that when your sentence ends, use a period.
6162384	6165125	Or if you're excited, use an exclamation point.
6165505	6168946	Or if you're asking a question, you use a question mark.
6169526	6172587	And then when you start your new sentence, you use the big letters.
6173578	6176784	By the way, that 300 baud modem, about the size of a Neo Geo cartridge.
6177085	6177366	No joke.
6177406	6177787	God, really?
6177847	6178127	I know.
6178909	6179690	Next email!
6179831	6180412	We have three left.
6180893	6182797	Hello, this is- Three!
6183939	6184380	You know what?
6184881	6185121	What?
6185882	6186382	Oh, it's fine.
6186882	6188583	We don't have a lot of stories left, so this fills time.
6188603	6189824	Hello, this is Blade 3.
6190204	6194646	I just want to say I'm a long-time listener and I've never called in, but I'm going to try this weekend.
6194746	6195466	Yes, please do.
6196067	6199469	Also, I wanted to ask your opinion about Counter-Strike Source and Knights of the Old Republic.
6199809	6200469	KOTOR!
6201129	6201730	If you've played them.
6202130	6203050	Sorry about my bad grammar.
6203070	6203951	I'm using my PSP.
6203991	6204371	That's okay.
6204391	6205732	Yours are still better than the last email.
6206332	6209933	I also wanted to tell Loki that I'm very impressed with the PSPOLR site.
6210273	6211113	It is so good.
6211653	6215754	On that note, I would like to ask his permission to use the source code for my own PSP site.
6216074	6220635	The name and images and links and stuff would be different, but I'm having trouble with formatting, so it would be handy.
6220755	6221035	Thanks.
6221596	6222596	Good show as always.
6222656	6223096	Keep it up.
6223276	6223616	P.S.
6223696	6228177	My site would be primarily used for PSP downloads such as videos, wallpapers, and demos directly to the PSP.
6228517	6231518	Well, Loki is not here to answer that question, so you'll have to ask him later.
6232179	6233060	Yeah, and he left chat.
6233340	6234461	You can always email him, though.
6234501	6236383	He likes getting emails.
6236403	6238045	He loves email.
6238065	6238686	A lot of them.
6239247	6241309	Especially email about My Little Pony.
6241569	6244152	And if you sign him up for porn mail lists, he'll love that.
6244492	6245494	Oh, he loves it so much.
6245714	6246395	It's so much fun.
6246775	6251057	Actually, we shouldn't be encouraging folks to do that because our website administrator probably would frown on that.
6251097	6252278	So, yeah, don't actually do that.
6252298	6253359	He was in his big frowny faces.
6253959	6255800	Actually, as far as Kotor, I'm sorry.
6255840	6260262	I had a friend who used to playtest that, and I got too used to hearing her calling it Skrotor.
6260903	6266706	So I have no ideas about the name, except I've been watching Udon Kru's art that they've been putting up on DeviantArt, and it looks pretty cool.
6267785	6271148	Well, when I have no opinion on the game, I mean, KOTOR's okay from what I've seen of it.
6271168	6272529	What was the other one, Counter-Strike?
6272769	6273410	Counter-Strike, Source.
6273630	6275291	Not my type of game, but Loki.
6275411	6277973	See, it's a bummer Loki wasn't here because he really plays that.
6278233	6280235	But when I don't really play the game, I turn to chat.
6280755	6282777	And Rob D says, Source was just fun.
6283077	6287080	KOTOR was revolutionary for Star Wars games and revitalized them for a little while.
6288422	6288862	There you have it.
6290669	6293271	I just kept hearing about, this game is buggy!
6293552	6294593	I hate this glitch!
6295033	6296815	Because of my friend, you.
6296935	6301799	Hey guys, I would like to comment on a story topic you folks talked about on your last show.
6302660	6305022	I would have called in then, but your 800 number was down at the time.
6305703	6315090	In regards to the story about the reworked Space Invaders game that was done for art slash commentary purposes, I feel pretty much as Jamie does.
6315230	6316691	I know because I'm right all the time.
6317272	6320974	I would just like to add my own two cents in the form of two rhetorical questions.
6321335	6324957	You know how the First Amendment to our Bill of Rights guarantees us the right to free speech?
6325318	6327940	Well, what amendment guarantees the right to not be offended?
6328060	6329221	Oh yeah, there isn't one.
6330001	6334364	Honestly, the whiny little fucker that was pissing and moaning about this issue really needs to get a grip.
6334884	6345951	Not only that, but if I was in the guy's shoes and the guys that did the exhibit, I probably would not have only kept the exhibit up, I would have most likely cobbled something together as a response to the whining.
6346051	6355057	I don't know, something along the lines of the player actually bringing the terrorists flying planes into Twin Towers but changed the plane into a flying pair of boobs or some phallic symbol instead of a plane.
6355317	6357058	Some of y'all are just vindictive like that.
6358859	6364743	Plus add a severed head, rampant cursing, a straight couple having sex, and two men kissing.
6364823	6367244	All of this would be a roundabout way of saying fuck you to the whiners.
6368365	6371267	One more thing that relates to this that I just remembered.
6371327	6376951	The original intention of free speech in the First Amendment was to protect the voice opinions...
6377831	6380512	of those whom are in a minority in a given issue.
6380972	6387715	No, I don't mean like race or anything, but I mean like those people who have unpopular views like the KKK, people who think Bin Laden is cool, etc.
6388055	6391156	Face it, not everyone has the same views slash opinions, etc.
6391536	6392296	Thanks for reading this.
6392557	6393137	Have a good one.
6393962	6396283	Honestly, that's perfectly right.
6396383	6409606	Everybody, no matter how offensive or distasteful their opinions are, as long as they are a citizen or at least legally living within this country, they do have a right to voice that opinion.
6410046	6412627	As long as they do so in...
6415447	6416207	An appropriate way.
6416447	6417267	You know what I mean?
6418188	6422368	There are some places, especially private ground, where people are not going to allow some people to say things.
6422768	6429130	A private organization may not let somebody from an outside source say something on their property.
6429770	6434251	But in the United States, we do have freedom of speech, even if it is unpopular and people are wrong.
6436631	6437872	Everyone's got a right to have an opinion.
6438792	6442492	I had to really think for a minute what that email was even about because it's been so long.
6442512	6444593	You know, like two weeks ever since Penny Arcade Expo.
6444633	6445053	Email Rob.
6445862	6448224	I'm not giving out the source code for the site.
6448244	6448464	Aww.
6464238	6465658	But, you know, he did work really hard on it.
6465678	6466159	He did earn it.
6466819	6467639	But I do want to say this.
6467699	6472620	Maybe if you could get Loki that chat thing he's been looking for, that other guy won't give up, maybe he'll make a trade.
6472700	6473000	Maybe.
6473120	6474121	I'm just hypothesizing.
6474821	6479022	Loki does go on to say, I've never played Counter-Strike, and no prawn email, please.
6479042	6480622	I get enough spam in my OLR email.
6481483	6481943	He's lying.
6481983	6482643	He loves the porn.
6483103	6483603	Just kidding.
6484783	6485344	Last email?
6485664	6485984	It's true.
6486024	6488384	We all get a lot of spam in our Orange Launch Radio boxes.
6488404	6489585	That's why I deleted mine.
6489705	6490125	Jerks.
6491004	6491704	Alright, yeah, this.
6491824	6492585	Last email, please.
6492765	6493005	Okay.
6493205	6498368	Hey guys, I would like to comment on a story slash topic you folks have talked about on your last show.
6499389	6500489	No, no comment at all.
6501050	6501790	I just read this one.
6501910	6502130	Did you?
6502250	6502370	Oh.
6502550	6503291	Yeah, boo.
6503851	6506613	Hey OLR, are you having a super special awesome Sunday?
6506913	6508434	Cookies for those who know the reference.
6509014	6519483	So anyways, I was downloading some old podcasts from the OL Archive when you guys were away for a week, and I can safely say that you have been a really great podcast throughout the years.
6519863	6524947	It was funny comparing your old expectations from the next-gen consoles and your usual antics.
6525307	6528870	By the way, DMN, Elebits is not a Katamari killer minus episode 200, sorry.
6531212	6536036	To finish, I was at Blockbuster today and saw copies of DDRX and DDR Hottest Party 2 bundles.
6536517	6541601	Since the release date is September 16th for both games, can retail stores sell the games beforehand?
6542182	6542842	Not technically.
6543363	6545424	Or does it really apply to street dates?
6545865	6549468	I was mulling over this when DDR Supernova came out earlier two years ago.
6549788	6552290	Anyway, great job at PAX and here's to another great episode.
6552611	6553892	This is from Katamari's Forever.
6554622	6558524	Sometimes too, the bundles and the game by itself come out at different times.
6558584	6559884	That's something really important to keep in mind.
6559904	6561525	That's what's going to be happening with Rock Band 2.
6562045	6566947	Rock Band 2 is coming out as a standalone game on the 360 for about a month until you start seeing the bundles hit streets.
6567328	6570249	So always keep that in mind when you see those types of things out in the wild too.
6571124	6571484	P.S.
6571604	6577107	It's my birthday at the time of reading this, September 7th, so it would really make my day if you read this.
6577147	6577487	Thank you.
6577848	6578428	Happy birthday!
6578748	6579989	Happy damn birthday!
6580189	6580849	Cha-cha-cha.
6581109	6586572	And in closing, if a Yaris crashes in the middle of nowhere and no one hears it, does the crappy game still exist?
6587013	6587573	Sadly, yes.
6587813	6589635	You know, I'm actually thinking of getting a Yaris.
6589655	6591156	I'm going to be buying a new car for Christmas.
6591196	6600724	That's going to be my Christmas present to myself, I've decided, because my previous Toyota I've had since 2001, and it's 98, so it officially turned 10 years old this year.
6600985	6601445	It's done.
6601565	6605128	It's time to put a gunshot in it and lay it down for a little while.
6606610	6607871	I'm actually thinking about a Yaris.
6608211	6609112	I love Toyotas.
6609452	6613736	If Rob gets one, that means if he gives us a ride somewhere, we can just say we're taking a ride in his crappy game.
6614298	6614478	Yep.
6615579	6617500	Bring all the jokes on that you want.
6617680	6619220	I'm really, really considering it.
6619260	6620921	Part done.
6622102	6622962	Alright, no more emails.
6625123	6627444	Mailbag at orangelauncher.com if you want to get in for next weekend.
6627544	6629465	Yes, open the floodgates of chat room.
6630306	6631566	Knock at me for wanting to get a Yaris.
6631747	6633707	Even if there were more emails, I'm not reading them.
6635288	6639770	You know, I could say I'm coming on here and getting any car and somebody would taunt me for my choice.
6639991	6640731	Get a Lancer.
6640771	6642152	I'm just going to have to do my own research.
6642772	6642852	No.
6643453	6644654	Thanks for watching!
6661559	6663200	He talks to dogs.
6663300	6664821	Yes, he's the dog whisperer.
6664901	6671465	See, either you knew that because you actually know it, in which case I'm going to make fun of you, or you knew that because you looked over here at my screen, in which case I'm going to pinch you.
6671505	6672225	Or a red show roll.
6672566	6672866	Oh, okay.
6673806	6674547	Well, that's what he does.
6674587	6675928	He's the dog whisperer.
6677008	6678910	You know, like the horse whisperer, but with dogs.
6679230	6682111	And yes, they're making a game out of it.
6684433	6687295	I'm leaving that pause for you to contemplate what this means for gaming.
6687435	6687675	Game!
6689145	6691447	and Nintendogs It Ain't, that's for sure.
6691507	6694489	It is actually a TV show on National Geographic Channel.
6694989	6698592	It was rated by the ESRB and then it kind of slipped away for a little while.
6698612	6699732	Well, now there's box art.
6699833	6702114	It is really happening and a PC version.
6702955	6713482	No idea what exactly you do in this game, but damn if you, I mean, I know they say don't judge a game by its cover, but for real, how can I not?
6714062	6716304	It's a freaking dog whisperer game.
6717978	6718478	Please.
6719760	6720861	This game has been judged.
6721821	6722182	Gong.
6723383	6723883	There you have it.
6724624	6725305	The end.
6725445	6726205	Dog Whisperer.
6726286	6728948	GameGuru says, sounds like another crappy Ubisoft game.
6728968	6730309	That's what most people are saying, actually.
6730329	6730930	Sounds like dog poo.
6731170	6732391	Yeah, the dog pooper.
6733112	6735254	Poobisoft, says Frisbee.
6735614	6736215	I like that.
6736635	6740919	That should be their new name, Poobisoft, whenever they have a crappy game we're talking about on the show.
6741339	6741920	I like that.
6742500	6743061	Don't forget that.
6743081	6743881	Poobisoft.
6744822	6750444	Loki's in chat and says it's not as bad as travel games for dummies on the DS and the My Stop Smoking Coach.
6750904	6754826	I want to say we talked about that My Stop Smoking Coach a few weeks ago when it was first announced.
6755366	6758227	That isn't nearly as bad as the freaking Dog Whisperer.
6758347	6760568	I see a lot of potential for My Stop Smoking.
6760848	6761848	But Dog Whisperer?
6762428	6762828	Really?
6764089	6764469	Really?
6766289	6766690	Really?
6768430	6769311	Dog Whisperer.
6770431	6770571	How?
6772213	6774415	PluckyGuy wants to see a Dog the Bounty Hunter game.
6775196	6775797	I don't know about that.
6776077	6777319	He's a controversial individual.
6777339	6778940	I don't know if you've heard the stories.
6779441	6780662	Alright, new story, new story.
6782244	6785708	Next story has to do with Space Invaders the keyboard.
6787249	6790153	They have made a Space Invaders keyboard.
6791374	6791935	And, um...
6793334	6799878	It has little letters on top of the little aliens on the keys and you really can't see them that well unless you're staring at them.
6800478	6802480	And then it has the shooty thing on the space bar.
6805041	6807743	It's a Space Invader keyboard for PC.
6809747	6810267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6834161	6836141	You know what I'm going to do when my keyboard dies?
6836541	6838142	Especially after I punch it in the face.
6838322	6839322	Well, if it had a face.
6839762	6842423	For the stupid fucking drivers not working.
6842643	6844163	Thank God I'm moving to Linux.
6845123	6847444	I'm going to repaint it.
6849944	6850544	Just for fun?
6850924	6852805	I'm going to paint a big Pac-Man on it.
6852845	6854745	You should paint fire on it.
6855125	6856085	I'm going to paint Pac-Man on it.
6856105	6857205	Paint Pac-Man on fire.
6858466	6859426	Paint your butt on fire.
6861215	6861375	What?
6861415	6862376	I didn't eat Chipotle today.
6863037	6865079	Anyhow.
6866821	6867241	Oh, God.
6867281	6870104	You know this shows hit rock bottom when we start making poopy jokes.
6870484	6870784	Anyhow.
6873590	6892558	by the way what a great lead into our next story speaking of lowest common denominator jokes I was going to say speaking of flaming butt every time the lowest common denominator gets brought up especially in games you can't help but reference the game Choaniki and if you don't know why Choaniki just google it
6893058	6894619	Just Google it and you'll see why.
6895219	6895939	Here's the thing.
6896019	6899260	Cho Iniki is... Now, this might come as a shock to you.
6899300	6901341	The game is out on Virtual Console in Japan.
6901681	6903461	It actually came out in Europe as well.
6903521	6904142	Here's the thing.
6905862	6907863	It's been rated by the ESRB.
6910844	6912724	That would be the American board.
6913505	6916786	They rated it E10 for mild suggestive themes.
6917659	6918680	No, here's the other thing.
6919260	6921381	It's been dated for Monday.
6922322	6924002	I'm downloading Cho Aniki!
6924022	6933648	Meaning, by the time you hear this episode, if this story isn't bullshit, which, you know, when the ESRP's involved, it may not... You may be able to play Cho Aniki on Virtual Console in America.
6933688	6934128	I just dropped my mic.
6934148	6935609	The unthinkable has happened.
6935749	6938310	Jamie has been so excited, she dropped her mic.
6940591	6941232	I'm happy.
6941832	6943053	Cho Aniki is so much fun.
6945379	6947040	I think it's kind of gay, actually.
6947100	6949021	It is very, very, very gay.
6950061	6950841	But in a good way.
6951241	6955323	I mean, if you actually go and say this game is gay, I'm actually going to agree with you.
6955383	6956964	I'm going to be like, yep, it is gay.
6960065	6966288	This game totally does it with other games of the same gender.
6968248	6970549	Frisbee says it is on the Nintendo website.
6971450	6972010	It's happening.
6973649	6976011	Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars
6999628	7000769	Legend of the Seven Stars
7021323	7022524	on the virtual console for download.
7023044	7029790	And as Loki in chat says, and I'm sure he would say if he were here in studio right now, motherfucking Super Mario RPG.
7031191	7032992	Word, Loki, word.
7036095	7037456	So, to continue on.
7038076	7039297	Yes, more, Choaniki 2?
7040598	7040918	No!
7040938	7046603	Quelltipo does want to point out, the first Choaniki game is the tamest in this series, and it is the first game.
7048286	7049167	Sheet music, Rob.
7049227	7049647	Sheet music.
7049667	7050508	Yes, sheet music.
7050548	7051088	What the sheet?
7053330	7059175	Well, it's sheet music that is titled Killer Instinct 3 main title.
7060977	7062718	It could be a fake.
7063859	7066141	It could be Photoshop-ity.
7066661	7068323	But it's been found somewhere.
7068703	7069344	And it says...
7071406	7081230	A Killer Instinct 3 And by the way, if anyone wants to hop out their MIDI recorder, it actually looks fairly complex and I can't play that high, so whatever.
7081330	7083411	I'm surprised nobody's tried to turn it into a MIDI file yet.
7083651	7087153	But here's the thing, what if it's just printed out from Cakewalk?
7087373	7091055	Like, it's not that hard to make a fake song and print it out with a fake title.
7092415	7092715	I don't know.
7092735	7095796	I think my BS meter is going off the charts on this.
7095816	7099077	But you remember the Christmas card thing that Rare did before?
7099457	7099798	Uh-huh.
7100318	7102078	With the KI3 Christmas card?
7102298	7102598	Mm-hmm.
7103239	7105679	Well, there was that, and now we have this music.
7106760	7109681	And now there were other rumors that were floating around.
7109721	7113282	Like there was the Fulgore picture, remember?
7114442	7114682	Yeah.
7115202	7116863	So it could happen.
7117759	7118500	And it could not.
7119321	7120562	I liked Killer Instinct.
7120582	7121003	Me too.
7121043	7122364	Don't get me wrong, but I don't know.
7123105	7125227	That would be a hell of an announcement maybe in 2009.
7125968	7126409	We'll see.
7126869	7127250	But I don't know.
7127270	7128050	I'm not going to hold my breath.
7129051	7130333	I would love nothing more than this.
7131894	7132695	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7165157	7173784	My FU of the week goes to the man with the small penis driving the truck that uses too much gas at the shopping center where I got my Starbucks from.
7176265	7177406	Stop doing cocaine!
7181089	7182330	I don't know how much I should say.
7182550	7184352	My FU of the week goes to...
7186020	7186701	Just say it.
7186781	7188661	A particular individual I'm thinking of.
7188742	7191623	No, I don't want to say it because if you give it attention, it only grows.
7192443	7199647	A particular individual I'm thinking of that really, really needs to stop stalking me.
7200007	7201668	And this isn't a joke.
7202028	7203669	It's not an OLR listener thing.
7203689	7204889	It's something going on in my real life.
7205190	7212853	I honestly feel like I'm being stalked by a certain individual that needs to cut the shit out and just move on with themselves because it's so frustrating.
7213353	7214194	And yeah.
7215037	7215979	Stop being immature.
7216199	7216660	Grow up.
7217562	7218223	Grow up.
7219745	7220146	Grow up!
7221989	7222310	That's it.
7224133	7225055	I guess that's it, huh?
7225315	7226658	Yeah, there's no one else here.
7226838	7227519	Just you and me.
7230246	7231947	Well, then I guess I'll do another story, huh?
7232127	7232848	I was going to say so.
7233008	7233308	All right.
7234569	7235329	Xbox Live.
7235369	7241333	Hey, if I want to take my aggressions out on something, I could punch people, and I will be able to do that in King of Fighters 98.
7241613	7244174	This game is going to Xbox Live Arcade.
7244214	7245115	You know, Fatal Fury?
7245475	7247096	I have several versions of that game.
7273476	7275062	Probably before the end of the year, I'd imagine.
7275102	7277610	King of Finders 98 on Virtual Console.
7277791	7278674	I might have to check that out.
7279457	7279738	We'll see.
7281690	7291994	Well, in other news, and this makes me specifically happy, and this is what actually brought it to my attention, is that one of my LiveJournal friends linked the trailer for Dissidia, Final Fantasy.
7294074	7295355	There's a YouTube video up.
7295715	7307059	But basically, it's a dramatic progressive action that's supposed to be like a fighting game with an RPG element, I think.
7307939	7311142	Um, but you move through a field map and then you have to fight different people.
7311182	7323674	But it's sort of actually, um, some of the, uh, fighting sequences are actually a lot like what was in Kingdom Hearts 2 where you run up walls and do all kinds of special stuff and earn points.
7324334	7326796	But the cool thing about this is actually, um...
7327737	7329278	who the characters in the games are.
7330099	7332121	Actually, you've got your villains and your heroes.
7332161	7336364	You've got the Warrior of Light from Final Fantasy versus Garland.
7336785	7339107	You have Frianel from Final Fantasy 2 and Unite.
7339727	7344331	They've shown Squall and Zidane and Tidus.
7344891	7355920	There's also, for some of the villains, there was the Emperor from Final Fantasy 2, Cloud of Darkness, Golbez, X-Death, Kefka, Sephiroth, Ultimecia, Kuja, and Jax from the...
7356721	7357101	Other ones.
7357201	7363546	I mean, I'm sure there's going to be more people from the other Final Fantasy games, some of the heroes coming into it.
7363626	7367088	But I think that's going to be pretty cool.
7367208	7367909	I'm looking forward to it.
7368029	7370771	I have to say, my inner fanboy is very pleased.
7371411	7374473	This game's been a little bit off the radar, but it looks hot.
7374894	7376895	Like, I really want to check this out when it comes out.
7376915	7377896	And I hate admitting that.
7378136	7379377	Like, you know what I mean?
7380305	7381526	But this game looks awesome.
7381687	7384750	But it's supposed to be just all the major heroes versus the major villains.
7386372	7387834	It has freaking Garland in it.
7387934	7388815	That's awesome.
7389609	7395553	Nomura is doing the character designs, but trying to keep some of Amano's style to it.
7396353	7397634	At least some of the characters are.
7399115	7408421	But they also said they used Jekt instead of Seymour for the Final Fantasy X references so they didn't have to put Yuna in it.
7411303	7411643	I don't know.
7412216	7416538	Well, there'd be too many people that would get too big of a thrill out of punching Yuna in the face, sadly.
7417038	7417739	Sorry, Yuna fans.
7418479	7423741	And they said that it's actually supposed to have twice as much dialogue as Crisis Core.
7424802	7425202	Dang.
7426402	7426843	Alright.
7427043	7427723	This could be fun.
7428023	7428443	We'll see.
7428844	7429464	I'm hoping so.
7430313	7434055	Alright, well another game that could be fun, Warhammer Online.
7434735	7439377	As you notice if you're listening to Part A, I had some fairly favorable things to say about the game during my little review of it.
7439417	7443258	I played it at Penny Arcade Expo, and a lot of you have been getting the chance to check this out too.
7443298	7448981	The open beta launched this weekend, playing Warhammer Online.
7449041	7450661	The beta launched earlier this morning.
7450721	7453823	Now, of course, it hasn't gone without some flaws.
7453883	7454863	Apparently some of the
7455083	7455783	Thanks for watching!
7478431	7480692	So yeah, it looks like there's a lot of problems with it.
7480712	7485454	But in theory, the beta is open, but it's probably just going to take a couple days for it to be ironed out.
7485494	7485974	But you know what?
7486314	7487574	Let's look at the long-term thing.
7488135	7494297	It's better this happen now than the day the game is actually supposed to come out and be on shelves and be out there for everybody, right?
7494317	7495417	Is it just me?
7495437	7495998	I don't know.
7496038	7496998	I'd rather this happen now.
7497018	7504921	But of course, then again, if I were one of these people trying to work my butt off to get in, I would probably also be pretty pissed, especially if I just happen to be outside the United States.
7504961	7507122	That's never cool to get the shaft.
7507802	7509024	because of where you live.
7510766	7511768	But in theory, it's up.
7512549	7514352	Hopefully, it'll get ironed out in the next couple days.
7514392	7514712	We'll see.
7515053	7518498	Skypline will be open very soon at www.orangelaunchradio.com.
7518518	7523545	Click on Interact With Us, our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, or 1-877-GAME-OLR in the U.S.
7523705	7524046	and Canada.
7525447	7541550	for people who are interested in Call of Duty 5 at least as far as our European listeners the World at War multiplayer beta will be out for PC and Xbox 360 in October the PS3 one has not yet been announced there's a chance it may not happen and
7542811	7543471	Nothing about we.
7544092	7552435	So it will be... They said the boot camp will open its doors and they haven't named a date yet.
7553076	7561179	But the speculation though would be November 14th for the actual release date.
7561880	7562160	So...
7564150	7568792	So they're thinking that it would probably correspond with the US one.
7569632	7577715	At any rate, you'll be able to use the squad system, be able to try some of the other new modes in it, the multiplayer mode.
7578195	7580956	So it'll be pretty cool, and I'd like to see what people think about it.
7581956	7588058	Call of Duty 4 was really freaking cool, so I have high expectations for Call of Duty 5.
7590599	7593440	Alright, well hopefully Call of Duty 5 does not disappoint.
7594753	7595414	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7614935	7616837	Social Networking Site Raptor RAPTR
7634609	7636851	You can also download an optional PC client.
7637131	7645637	And basically what it does is the service kind of watches you on all of these various sites, and it tracks all of your gaming progress, so to speak, on one site.
7646138	7649140	Also, it'll let your friends know when you're online and playing games.
7649480	7653783	So if you're actually using the free PC client, folks can see when I'm playing World of Warcraft.
7654224	7662670	So if you're kind of one of those people that always has a hard time finding friends to play online games with or whatever, whenever they're online, Raptor could be an option.
7663330	7663590	RAPTOR.COM
7688908	7692771	Be careful when you think about those things because these sites really try to get you to link to everything.
7693592	7700656	They're just trying to hoard out to as many people as possible so that they can get their numbers up to possibly sell ads or whatever they're going to do in the future.
7702818	7703778	Could be interesting.
7705459	7705800	We'll see.
7706040	7709362	I really would like to get them on the show and just ask them what's the point.
7709942	7710863	Maybe they can justify it.
7710883	7712084	I imagine there's got to be a reason to it.
7712104	7714145	They've had a lot of money invested in it.
7714385	7716907	I believe it's from one of the co-creators of
7718493	7719714	God, what was the other thing he made?
7721294	7721755	I don't remember.
7721795	7723035	Was it Steam?
7724296	7724896	Don't quote me on that.
7724916	7725997	Somebody in chat will probably remember.
7726917	7729138	The guy made something else that was really big and popular.
7729859	7730879	I don't remember off the top of my head.
7731380	7732000	I don't remember either.
7732360	7733441	But I signed up for it.
7733481	7735422	If you want to send me a friend request, I guess so.
7736842	7737943	Sky is just my name on there.
7737983	7738463	Just like Twitter.
7738643	7739123	S-K-I-E.
7739644	7740724	So, there you go.
7741325	7743065	Unless you're my stalker, then you can't add me.
7743125	7743366	Sorry.
7746207	7747948	Because I don't need that person finding me in Warcraft.
7749286	7751869	GS68 here Last week I got around to playing Street Fighter 4
7772927	7781873	Well, I didn't really play it much, so I don't know much about the game mechanics and stuff, but the first thing you see is the graphics, and they're really nice.
7782453	7786196	My complaint is that the male fighters look a little too muscular.
7788154	7790075	Do the female fighters have too big of boobies?
7790115	7792897	Like everything is really overemphasized or what?
7792997	7793538	I'm not sure.
7794458	7806646	What they liked about the setup here at San Jose State was that they had two cabinets and they're linked up so that way... Which is good because not only does each player have their own cabinet like those Japanese cabinets but...
7808327	7814994	You can also play one player mode without if someone else is already playing in this mode called beginner mode.
7815054	7818117	And it basically lets you go three rounds without anyone challenging you.
7819378	7821320	Which is nice because I suck at fighting games.
7822180	7824242	Give us an idea, how big is this game?
7824302	7826665	I mean, were there just tons and tons of people there to play?
7827926	7829928	There's always people playing.
7832556	7836381	Is this game really getting out there?
7836421	7840146	I mean, I've been so distracted by all the other goings on in the PAX world and all that.
7840346	7843911	I haven't really been following, but I know it was really big when it got into a couple arcades.
7843971	7847536	Is it slowly finding its way into more and more and more places where it's not too hard to find now?
7849864	7851245	I'm not sure how to go down there.
7851605	7855827	Only until I went down there did I discover that we finally have Street Fighter 4 here in the Bay Area.
7857908	7861330	I mean, as I've said before, the arcade scene is dying.
7861390	7868214	I mean, new arcade games tend to catch the gaming community as a whole by surprise these days.
7868334	7874017	Whereas for games on PC and console, we know exactly when they're going to come out, so there's no surprise to that.
7875205	7879389	I do want to point out in chat, AkumaJP has some comments about the Street Fighter 4 graphics.
7879429	7882192	Says the muscle is good and Chun-Li has an elephant leg.
7883533	7885134	So her legs are even thicker than ever?
7886636	7888638	Chun-Li has amazing thighs.
7889599	7891180	Sheik would put Marilee Rett into shame.
7892862	7895524	There you go.
7895544	7898427	GS68, any other thoughts on Street Fighter 4 before we get to another call?
7899361	7901283	Um, shit ass, I need to also say I forgot.
7901363	7907170	Oh yeah, now that Super Mario RPG is out, I can't wait for all of you game fans to complain, where's my Earthbound?
7907330	7908431	Where's my Earthbound?
7909052	7910413	I'll start, where's my Earthbound?
7911455	7911575	Oh.
7912316	7914518	Alright, have a good one GS68, take care buddy.
7915239	7915579	You too.
7915699	7916040	Bye.
7917501	7920565	Uh, PluckyGuy in chat says, I kinda like Chun-Li's Jungle Booty.
7922130	7923491	Nothing wrong with a big butt.
7923511	7926872	1-877... Just rub like big butts and cannot lie.
7927312	7928233	You other brothers can't deny.
7928253	7936236	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call here live on this Sunday evening, September the 7th of 2008.
7937877	7938817	Let's go to the phones.
7939398	7940758	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
7940778	7941158	Who's this?
7944920	7945220	Hello?
7945600	7946541	Hello, hi, who's this?
7946681	7947321	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7947341	7948221	Hello, this is Sag.
7948522	7950482	Hey, Sag, my friend.
7950803	7951303	How are you?
7952057	7953739	I'm doing quite alright, and yourself?
7954039	7955080	I am doing awesome.
7955300	7956381	Hello, I met you.
7958023	7960325	Zeg was one of my buddies, lives in the Bay Area.
7960345	7962727	The cupcake shop, or store, right?
7963488	7965650	Yes, he told the cupcake story, but nobody's going to get that.
7966410	7968933	He also wore the manly corset one day, which was great.
7968953	7970734	That was a fabulously manly corset.
7970995	7972396	Definitely showed off your hourglass figure.
7973417	7975339	And only three jerks that day, too.
7976279	7977881	I was quite surprised.
7979111	7982453	That there weren't as many jerks there.
7982473	7983354	Welcomely surprised.
7983895	7988779	You know, just be glad you weren't the guy in the Princess Peach outfit because his picture got on blogs and stuff.
7990701	7991001	I don't know.
7991201	7991481	You know what?
7991501	7992802	You've inspired me, Seg.
7992883	7995425	Next year, I'm going to push the cross-dressing envelope.
7996555	7997815	I wasn't cross-dressing.
7998036	7999096	I know you weren't, but I'm just saying.
7999116	8002117	I'm just making sure for everyone else listening in.
8002277	8006838	I want to incorporate a little more femininity into my outfits.
8008318	8008698	I don't know.
8008718	8010939	I just think you need to parade through the con as Frank.
8011839	8014240	Should I bring my full Frankenfurter regalia next year?
8014340	8016200	Bring it.
8016320	8017921	And you also need the curly mullet wig.
8018441	8018961	Forget it.
8019001	8019301	I'm sorry.
8019341	8022062	Seg probably had things he wanted to talk about that aren't corsets.
8022422	8023202	What's on your mind, Seg?
8024232	8027715	Well, it is in the similar vein of PAX.
8027975	8033760	I couldn't really look up for any confirmation, but I heard talks that PAX is thinking about doing East Coast.
8035061	8051355	But what I want to propose out to the listeners and all that is, how do you think the whole convention dynamic would change with a major East Coast specific for video games conference?
8052287	8053267	I do want to say this real quick.
8053308	8056749	It has been confirmed by the Penny Arcade Expo organizers, Boston in 2010.
8056929	8058950	They have already booked the venue, apparently.
8059050	8059290	Okay.
8059410	8059851	I just wasn't 100%.
8060411	8061531	I forgot where I read it.
8061631	8062092	No, that's all right.
8063032	8065113	You know, timing is everything, in my opinion.
8065233	8069195	I think they can get away with doing two shows in a year if they're really well spaced out.
8069535	8074758	Especially, you know, if it's true that they're doing it in April, that's not a bad time to do it because you have a lot of game releases.
8074798	8076118	When are most games released?
8076379	8079240	They're released in the early summer or they're released right before Christmas.
8079600	8108904	so if you have your early April show kind of promoting those spring games and you have the August show promoting the holiday games which PAX is kind of doing I think they can pull it off I would be very curious to see though if it ends up kind of if each con kind of eats each other but maybe that's what they want and when I say that I mean is attendance going to go down at one because now they have this other one available but maybe in a way that's what they want maybe that's how they're trying to control Seattle from getting too big go ahead
8109690	8117840	Well, to me, as someone who lived in the East Coast and the Midwest, I grew up in Michigan and also lived in Boston for a few years.
8118722	8120344	There was... I mean, there are...
8122196	8122736	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8144313	8161480	If nothing else comes down, a large big name on the East Coast, that PAX really has a very interesting opportunity here to be something, to really fill a demand that hasn't been filled yet with East Coast.
8161520	8165182	Because you've got all the people that wanted to go but couldn't make that big huge stretch out there.
8165282	8166982	Now it's a little bit more easier.
8167122	8168763	It's like, oh, it's just a weekend.
8170144	8173545	It's less than a day to get there versus a flight across the country.
8174175	8174555	Harmonix, 2K, Rockstar
8202575	8219704	Well, I know there's people that definitely travel, but there's definitely a lot of people, I mean, there's a lot of friends I have in both of those regions that definitely can't schedule out such a huge disruption to take a lot of time off work because they have to fly across the country, but
8220481	8225784	If it was right in their hometown or very close by, that's a lot of names there.
8225864	8232907	And as far as not as many, yeah, the total amount of studios between the coast definitely leans towards West Coast.
8233207	8237109	But there's still a lot of big-name studios that had to fly everything else over.
8237429	8239591	and not every West Coast studio went to PAX either.
8239691	8243254	Like, you know, I made fun of Capcom earlier and Konami was another big name that wasn't there.
8243274	8245216	You know, not everybody's going to PAX yet.
8245256	8245856	Yeah, exactly.
8246197	8253263	So I think that also works to their advantage where they'll still get big names but they're not going to be flooding the doors like, say, Comic Con on vendors.
8254527	8255387	You know, it could be interesting.
8255487	8256868	I wonder how many people would go to both.
8257108	8257808	I'm crazy enough.
8257868	8258628	I would want to go to both.
8258868	8259848	You know, I love the East Coast.
8259868	8260688	I would want to go visit.
8260708	8262149	But I also have places to crash at.
8262209	8264029	You know, I have plenty of friends to crash at.
8264089	8265629	Especially if the shows are different enough.
8265689	8272031	If you do get those different exhibitors that show up on the East Coast versus the West Coast, I think it could be sustainable for two cons.
8272311	8276832	And shit, if they're serious about doing the Europe con too, shit, people will probably go to that too.
8277452	8279494	I mean, I don't know if we would, because it's a lot harder.
8279514	8281836	You know, when you talk international flight, that's a big one.
8282177	8290945	But, you know, I'm sure, you know, if they're doing Eurogamer Expo and Leipzig is growing leaps and bounds, what they were saying, what, like 200,000 freaking people at Leipzig or something?
8291485	8294328	Hell, you know, my coworkers were at Leipzig.
8294688	8294989	Yeesh.
8295449	8295769	Yeesh.
8296410	8300073	So, Bobby Blackwolf's in chat and says, I do eight hours from each.
8300774	8304718	and a lot of folks in chat are saying I would love to go to PAX East and I know I would like to go too.
8305058	8309622	And Actdeft, our poor listener in Mexico says, I would just like to have a MexicoCon, please.
8310643	8311104	Start one.
8312525	8312966	You never know.
8313686	8314507	Call it Mexicon.
8315248	8315868	Mexicon?
8316529	8317170	I like that.
8318951	8323035	Alright, Seg, we got a long call but it's been a great call but I gotta wrap it up.
8323055	8325878	Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we go to the next call?
8326431	8328472	Well, you know, I have to self-promote.
8329372	8335055	All cool and attractive people, and that includes you, must, you know, look into getting Strong Bad.
8336375	8337576	Have to plug my own thing.
8337956	8344218	I didn't know if you wanted to talk about that, but yes, you worked on the Strong Bad game, so you're very excited about the release, and I hear it's doing very well, right?
8344238	8346199	What, third week in a row it's top of the charts on Wii?
8346259	8347560	Third week on the top of the charts.
8347740	8348640	All right, let's go for four!
8349321	8350081	All right, take care.
8350201	8350941	All right, take care, buddy.
8351502	8351662	Yep.
8351882	8352402	All right, bye-bye.
8353823	8359549	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.
8360791	8362753	I'd be so down with PAX Boston, wouldn't you?
8363894	8366036	I would be down if someone would pay my way.
8366537	8367978	If we can make it work, we never know.
8368379	8369640	Alright, let's get another phone call.
8369680	8371122	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8372583	8374686	Hey, it's the Rob D. Hey, Rob D. Hello!
8374706	8375767	What is on your mind, my friend?
8376969	8377449	Not too much.
8377889	8382551	I hope this connection actually works out pretty well, because I'm on a new ISP, so the Skype connection may drop.
8383191	8383751	So far, so good.
8384652	8386092	Just wanted to talk about PAX, really.
8386312	8386732	Not too much.
8389073	8390694	Well, what did you think of PAX?
8390774	8391594	Please, walk us through it.
8392469	8392789	Fair enough.
8393269	8394470	I saw you guys there, which is excellent.
8394490	8396251	And actually, I saw many all-gamers there.
8396271	8398552	I think about 25, somewhere around there.
8398792	8402013	It actually ended up being a very good all-games meetup, a very good OLR meetup.
8402834	8407336	I had Kevin DDR from the OLR chatroom and some other just really great people.
8407376	8410117	I mean, I was really surprised that... Well, I shouldn't say that.
8410137	8414839	I shouldn't say that I was surprised, but it was really great to see that everyone there was really just a cool person.
8415219	8418601	No one misrepresented themselves online in any way.
8419969	8421810	Everyone was just a lot of fun to be around.
8422010	8423891	I know this is something we usually say in the past.
8423931	8429774	I don't think all games really does this, but it was nice to see that everybody kind of adopted that creed of don't be a dick.
8429834	8432415	Nobody was an asshole, which is a good thing.
8432555	8435177	That's because Wil Wheaton had a sign up that said don't be a dick.
8436577	8439398	Except for me, I was an asshole.
8439598	8442780	Rob was the biggest diva the whole time.
8442860	8443980	I'm king of nice, damn it.
8444360	8447041	No, but seriously, in all seriousness, everybody was cool.
8447541	8448362	You know what I mean?
8448402	8452183	Sometimes when you meet strangers from the internet, you get a few weirdos in there, but everybody was pretty cool.
8453897	8456959	and having dinner with you guys and actually being able to talk with you guys.
8457979	8468163	I will admit that when we were actually broadcasting, just being surrounded by Bobby, you, DarkSakura, and Loki, I was like, what am I doing here?
8468203	8469104	I don't belong here.
8469204	8471085	You were being awesome is what you were doing.
8471265	8471645	It was great.
8472245	8473366	Yeah, a little bit, definitely.
8495185	8495886	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8512691	8513532	Yeah, he definitely said that.
8514692	8520856	He actually said that when he stepped up to the mic, he was shaking a little bit, which I thought was kind of funny, although I shouldn't make fun of him too much.
8520916	8526240	I mean, it's probably the first time he's ever done anything like that, like over the internet and broadcasting and that sort of thing.
8526460	8527761	Yeah, you learn it's no big deal.
8527901	8529402	Any schmo can get an internet show, right?
8530522	8530843	It's true.
8531043	8531283	All right.
8532484	8535506	What about the actual games and sights and sounds of PAX?
8535526	8537587	What kind of games did you play at PAX that you liked?
8539420	8544901	Well, I played Mortal Kombat vs. DC, which surprised me because it was actually fun.
8545041	8545942	It's a Mortal Kombat game.
8545982	8547262	It'll never be a competitive fighter.
8547282	8548502	That's not what Mortal Kombat's for.
8548642	8564826	Mortal Kombat's really just for the fatalities, all the fun party game stuff, watching someone break someone else's body over their back and seeing 18 tibias and fibulas fly, even though no human could possibly have that many bones in their body.
8565926	8568207	They were all the same bone over and over.
8569795	8570276	Exactly.
8571096	8572978	But what else did I see?
8573839	8578784	The TNA Impact game, which I am a little bit of a wrestling fan, so I had to play that.
8579444	8579905	It was sad.
8579985	8581947	No one was playing that when I actually went up there.
8582027	8587312	One of the developers was there by himself playing his own game, which marked me as... It was kind of sad in a way.
8588033	8589894	I went up there and played him, and it was a good time.
8590175	8591336	You made his day, probably.
8591356	8591436	Yeah.
8592383	8604111	probably, although not as much as I made the day of the Lox Quest people because one of them actually stood right by me and walked me through the game and explained the different steps of development.
8605672	8606832	They have no idea who I am.
8608473	8614377	They're hoping that I'm probably some gaming journalist, but I'm just a fan and they're taking all this time to tell me that because I'm probably the first person to go by there.
8614477	8616839	Tower defense games are not exactly big things at PAX.
8618168	8618709	Those poor guys.
8618729	8624734	But, you know, I gotta say, though, PAX does give a really good shot to, like, the indie developers and stuff, especially with that PAX 10 thing.
8625054	8627537	You know, those 10 indie games were right in the middle of the show floor.
8627597	8628297	You can't miss them.
8628618	8631881	And, you know, that's probably how Jamie got caught with the sushi game and all that stuff.
8631901	8634883	You know, they're pretty good about... Those guys were great, but they were tucked away in the corner.
8635224	8641149	Yeah, they don't really have, like, the Kensha Hall syndrome that E3 has, where, like, oh, the weird stuff goes to Kensha Hall.
8641530	8642330	You gotta go to the basement.
8642350	8643011	You know what I mean?
8644637	8649832	I never actually made my way over to the PAX 10, so I can't say whether that was actually good or not.
8649972	8651637	From what I hear, it was okay, at the very least.
8652967	8654207	I got so much swag from PAX.
8654227	8655548	I got three different shirts.
8655668	8657409	I got a bunch of Rockstar stickers.
8657449	8658629	I got, what else did I get?
8658869	8665152	I didn't actually manage to get one of those energy drink samples, which I don't know if you went by there, that energy drink booth that was kind of packed away in the corner.
8665752	8670994	You thought they were giving away free cans of their drink, but it was really like, I don't know, a hundred empty cans just sitting on the table.
8672254	8675215	I saw that one, and they want you to sign up to win a case or something.
8676896	8679877	I did sign up, though, for the ECA, and they were giving out Balls Geek beer.
8681325	8681525	Really?
8681785	8682265	I didn't see that.
8682445	8683425	It was so good.
8683766	8685586	Root beer with caffeine.
8686766	8687046	Ooh.
8687846	8688426	That does sound good.
8688867	8690127	What else did I see?
8690147	8693207	I didn't manage to actually play any of the games that had a gigantic line, like LittleBigPlanet.
8693227	8694348	I just kind of stayed away from those.
8695408	8696148	Oh, you missed out.
8696188	8697528	LittleBigPlanet was great.
8698008	8701149	Now, granted, you know, we were a little spoiled since we got to go in a little bit early.
8701249	8702449	You know, there wasn't a line for it.
8702729	8704350	And we got to get walked through by the U.S.
8704390	8704810	producer.
8705350	8708891	And, yeah, I was spoiled, but, man, so worth it.
8709311	8710571	I'm all about LittleBigPlanet now.
8712950	8715553	Yeah, I have expected the Sonic RPG to be horrible.
8715573	8722741	I went by the Sega booth, which took me a little while to find at first until I realized that there was a gigantic Sega sign.
8723002	8725425	Do you know we didn't even realize Sega was there until day two?
8727441	8730503	I mean, they didn't exactly, like, there weren't any Sega signs, like, on the booth itself.
8730563	8739590	It was just the giant Sega sign hanging from the ceiling, and you wouldn't really notice that unless you were a really far distance away, and by that point, you may have gotten distracted by tons of other booths.
8739610	8744154	You know, you're going toward the Sega booth, and they're like, ooh, Afro Samurai, I should play that, which is also great.
8744174	8745795	That game was hot.
8746912	8750174	I love the Little Red Riding Hood Killing the Zombies game.
8750514	8751134	That was hot too.
8751154	8751795	That was funny.
8752215	8759218	Alright, Rob D, we've got to wrap it up here because we can probably get one more call, but quickly, best thing about PAX and worst thing about PAX?
8760819	8762760	Best thing about PAX, the people, without question.
8762780	8773485	I like the con, I like the exhibitors hall, but actually being able to see everyone and talk with the people that I've been chatting with over the last few years was just really just made for an unparalleled experience at any con I've been to.
8773906	8774926	The worst thing, the amount of people.
8776857	8778299	The amount of people, by far.
8778740	8781964	I couldn't actually make it into any panel without waiting at least an hour in line.
8782785	8787050	By the time I saw how long the lines were, I didn't even try.
8789253	8791656	Something was going to have to be done about that for next year.
8791697	8793839	I don't know what, but they'll think of something fair.
8794482	8794802	We'll see.
8795162	8796723	Maybe they'll get to organize it better.
8796743	8798124	They'll figure out how to organize it better.
8798144	8805227	I mean, the fact is that they've only had five years, which isn't really a long amount of time for any con, especially when they've been in the Seattle Convention Center for, I think, two years.
8805627	8805827	True.
8805988	8806368	Very true.
8806628	8807688	And there's a whole sixth floor.
8807768	8809069	I bet they're going to have to open it next year.
8809109	8809429	We'll see.
8809449	8810870	Thanks for taking my call.
8810890	8811510	Because what was going on?
8811610	8814312	Gender Odyssey was going on at the same time we were there.
8814712	8815212	I think so.
8815232	8818594	Yeah, they kind of kept that on the down low, which is probably a good idea with...
8819654	8822457	with how immature gamers can be on occasion.
8822577	8827522	Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't have cared, you know, heck, with all the years I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show, I've seen everything.
8827822	8832406	But, you know, I think it's kind of interesting how segregated they kept the two.
8832887	8833407	Very interesting.
8833747	8835309	Alright, Rob D., thanks for the call.
8835349	8835849	Take care, buddy.
8836310	8836830	And good to meet you.
8836850	8837191	Yep, you too.
8837451	8839113	We'll see you next year, right?
8840033	8840454	Hopefully.
8840634	8840994	Alright.
8841615	8842055	Work on it.
8842115	8842856	Save your pennies now.
8842976	8843437	Alright, see ya.
8844585	8846607	That's all I'm going to have to do is start saving now.
8847087	8849269	I think we can fit in one more call.
8849289	8852592	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8853092	8855114	I think after one more call we should be good here.
8856875	8857916	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8857936	8858297	Who's this?
8859137	8861279	Hello, Guy, and Blade 3.
8863241	8863921	Blade 3.
8863981	8864882	What is on your mind, Blade 3?
8866203	8866583	Not much.
8866603	8867825	It's kind of late where I am.
8868485	8868965	Where are you?
8869226	8869966	Are you on the East Coast?
8870667	8871087	Yeah, it's 12.
8872586	8875747	All right, it's way past everyone's bedtime over there, but that's all right.
8875767	8877348	We're trying to wrap up the show so y'all can go to bed.
8878028	8878509	What's on your mind?
8878529	8879649	What did you call in about tonight?
8880630	8888613	Well, I just wanted to tell Loki, because I'm sure he's still listening, that I figured out my own coding for my website.
8889413	8891975	Oh, you sent us an email wanting Loki's source code.
8892595	8892875	Mm-hmm.
8893240	8893700	Yeah, so I made my own.
8922304	8928869	and you can check it out at mmtsp.tk Nice, I love that he's working in a plug.
8929429	8931331	What will I find on this wonderful PSP site?
8932832	8935073	Right now it's in a semi-beta.
8937475	8942519	Basically there's just one page and it just has links to other pages but nothing on them so far.
8943620	8945241	Alright, well you gotta start somewhere.
8946418	8954983	By the end of the week, I should have quite a few demos, some DVDs, some funny videos, and some soundtracks from games.
8955863	8956684	One more thing.
8956744	8961026	I'm making a PSP site as an add-on to my regular site, and my regular site is masterman.pk.
8975745	8976869	Plug, plug, plug, plug.
8976990	8979358	You know, we're going to start charging 50 bucks a plug.
8979820	8980322	Just so you know.
8980502	8981968	Alright, best of luck with your sites, buddy.
8982881	8983121	All right.
8983181	8983681	Have fun.
8983861	8984141	All right.
8985042	8987002	So all of our listeners need to go visit these sites.
8987042	8989243	And if they're terrible, I want you to tear this guy apart.
8989323	8989823	No, I'm kidding.
8989843	8990143	I'm kidding.
8990183	8990463	I'm kidding.
8990503	8991343	You got to start somewhere.
8991824	8994064	We're all about supporting the independents and new ideas.
8994104	8996645	And, you know, PSP sites aren't really getting enough love.
8996685	8998185	I mean, sure, there's a few sites out there.
8998505	9000286	But, man, that's a whole universe.
9000326	9002226	It's not really being explored as well as it could be.
9002767	9003787	So someday.
9003807	9004407	All right.
9004427	9005747	Well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9005767	9006728	Sorry for those who didn't get through.
9006748	9009228	But you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
9009268	9010609	Give Jamie some work to do next week.
9011462	9012183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9028511	9029112	I don't think so.
9029152	9032976	I think it was a sale that was only for this weekend?
9033376	9034477	I believe so.
9034717	9035418	I don't remember.
9035878	9039742	But Mass Effect went down to 300 points of Bring Down the Sky.
9040282	9042044	Lost Odyssey triple bonus pack went to 120.
9043265	9050532	Forza Motorsport 2, the Motegi track pack, and the September, December, March car packs went down to 240 each.
9052293	9079128	Oblivion, Elder Scrolls 4, Shivering Isles went to $1,600 Guitar Hero 3, Def Leppard, Foo Fighters, Classic Rock Trackpacks to $360 Beautiful Katamari, the accessory ABCD set went to $120 Special accessory as well, Just Size stage went to $120 And the Big Ten 11 stages went to $140 So that's it Alright, I like sales, I like cheap things
9080529	9083633	Alright, I do have a last minute story real quick.
9083673	9085055	It has to do with the Max Payne movie.
9085135	9086317	Tiger Claw sent me this one.
9086377	9087859	I remember reading about this earlier in the week.
9087899	9088940	It didn't make our show roll though.
9089301	9092925	But apparently the Max Payne movie has been rated R and not happy.
9093526	9095369	John Moore, the director of the movie, is pissed.
9095869	9097131	It was supposed to be a PG-13 movie.
9098552	9100613	I'm hoping he's lobbying the MPAA.
9100653	9101754	What a bunch of fuckwads.
9120422	9121483	Horrible what they've done.
9122724	9129009	Anyway, the MPAA has slapped an R on this movie, which means it's not going to be able to be seen by teenagers.
9129029	9129509	Which, who knows?
9129569	9130890	Maybe it really is for the best.
9131251	9132972	Maybe we have blurred the lines too much.
9133272	9135614	Max Payne, I would definitely put an R on that.
9135714	9139897	Well, apparently, though, he actually, he did try to dumb it down a little bit.
9139957	9142418	Like, he actually kind of cut out some of the language.
9143879	9145000	No heads are cut off.
9145080	9147122	No eyeballs are ripped out or any of that stuff.
9147162	9155827	He actually did tame it down a bit to try and get the PG-13 and still got the R. So he was kind of miffed about that, as you can understand.
9156068	9156588	But here's the thing.
9156648	9164253	He actually goes so far as to say, they gave the Dark Knight a PG-13 rating and basically sucked Warner Brothers' cock.
9164733	9165494	His words, not mine.
9166636	9168260	But you know, it's something to think about.
9168521	9170525	The Dark Knight was a pretty dark film too.
9172510	9174634	I think it just goes to show the MPAA is fucked.
9177868	9179029	Fire em all, that's what I say
9205814	9211280	Quotipo does say though, and I think this is interesting, I'd be more willing to see an R-rated Max Payne than a PG-13 version.
9212841	9218307	TigerClaw says, here's the thing, the first Mortal Kombat movie was PG-13, even though it was based on an M-rated game.
9218707	9221410	The movie wins you back because of all the kick-ass fight sequences.
9221950	9222971	Hmm, something to think about.
9224238	9225879	So, lots of good points made by everybody.
9226619	9229461	Alright, well that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9229501	9231222	Hey, thanks you guys for sticking with us tonight.
9231742	9234403	And myself and DarkSakura holding down the fort.
