7000	13000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto!
14000	19000	Tonight, September 7th, 2008, we take some time to decompress after Penny Arcade Expo,
19000	22000	Luminous makes its way to yet another platform,
22000	26000	and could a new Kingdom Hearts game be showing at Tokyo Game Show?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	42000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	47000	We weren't here last week because, you know, we were at Penny Arcade Expo, that would be myself, Rob Roberts,
47000	51000	and the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51000	52000	Hi!
52000	53000	But we are back this week, are we not?
53000	54000	Yes we are.
54000	56000	So to do another podcast for you lovely people out there.
56000	59000	The tape's live on Sunday nights over AllGames.com.
59000	62000	But not joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki!
62000	64000	We're joined instead by your laundry.
64000	70000	Yes, my laundry is instead sitting in the chair that Loki usually does, because, you know, we tape at my house.
70000	76000	But, very interesting, the wife was so mad that he went to Penny Arcade Expo, she killed him.
76000	79000	So he's not here tonight, nor will he ever be back.
79000	81000	She's replaced him with Rob's laundry.
81000	84000	Yes. No, just kidding of course.
84000	88000	He's away at a thing for his day job today that he had to go to, so he won't be here tonight.
88000	91000	But he'll be back next week, as we all will.
91000	102000	And we have no guests tonight either, it's just the lovely DarkSakura, myself, feeling the love with all you kids from our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
102000	104000	And we have some stuff there in chat.
104000	107000	Gsquared68 says, Orange Laundry Mower Radio.
107000	109000	I tried to get Dan to come tonight.
109000	110000	Yeah?
110000	111000	What was his excuse?
111000	112000	He had to work.
112000	113000	Aw, bummer.
113000	123000	Yeah, weren't you telling me that Dan, you know, gosh, he's so, so just worked and worn out, he was playing Street Fighter IV this week or something?
123000	126000	It was at the Game Crazy Manager Conference.
126000	134000	They either had it there or he went to an arcade that had one, but he played Street Fighter IV and said that it was pretty good but the jumping was weird.
134000	135000	Hmm.
135000	137000	He looks very slick from what I've seen. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on it.
137000	139000	He said he played like any Street Fighter.
139000	140000	Nice.
140000	141000	Very excited.
141000	142000	Of course, that's not the one I'm excited about.
142000	143000	What are you excited about?
143000	145000	Freaking Capcom vs. Tatsunoko.
145000	146000	I had a feeling.
146000	147000	Any particular reason?
147000	148000	Gotcha, mon!
148000	149000	Well, yeah.
149000	150000	Gotcha, mon.
150000	153000	And Dan's like, it doesn't, it doesn't have Joe in it.
153000	158000	I was like, but it has Ken and it has Hurricane Polymer and Kashawn, so it's all cool.
158000	159000	Alright, very nice.
159000	160000	And Tekamon.
160000	167000	Gsquared68 is also mentioning in our chatroom, San Jose State has it, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump from us, so maybe we have to take a road trip at some point.
167000	168000	That would be cool.
168000	169000	That would be fun.
169000	172000	A little OLR road trip as if Seattle wasn't fun enough.
172000	183000	Speaking of Seattle, Penny Arcade Expo, you know, unfortunately we did not get to do our own show just due to some technical difficulties, but we contributed to...
183000	184000	Shut up.
184000	185000	No, no, no, no, no.
185000	188000	Due to, I'm going to come clean on this one.
188000	189000	Alright.
189000	201000	When we were going to be doing a show, Jamie instead passed out, while I managed to pass out over a conversation, so that meant that we had no show Saturday night.
201000	202000	Yeah, technical difficulties.
202000	204000	We'll just leave it at that.
204000	205000	Host difficulties.
205000	206000	Yeah.
206000	208000	Doesn't technical difficulties sound better than host malfunction?
208000	210000	I had technical difficulties with my ability to stay awake.
210000	212000	Jamie has a walking technical difficulty, actually.
212000	214000	You know what, Rob?
214000	216000	But, no, we had a lot of fun at PAX.
216000	218000	It was OLR bonding.
218000	219000	It was fantastic.
219000	221000	And some Bobby bonding as well.
221000	224000	And some hatred of the western internet.
224000	226000	Yes, the western internet was sucky.
226000	228000	And some bonding with our listeners.
228000	231000	We had some great, we had just a wonderful turnout from the All Games Network.
231000	236000	Such an experience with that super glue and duct tape, I swear.
236000	239000	The Penny Arcade Expo you never hope to experience.
239000	243000	But, no, we all went out for a real nice dinner one night with ourselves.
243000	251000	Some of the other All Games hosts were there, like Loserleaf and Deadpix Alive went with us and some of the other folks like Rob Dee who did this day in gaming, I think it was called.
251000	253000	And it's been too long.
253000	255000	And just a bunch of listeners came with us out to dinner one night.
255000	256000	It was fantastic.
256000	257000	We had a great time.
257000	258000	We had really good food on top of it.
258000	259000	Yeah, absolutely.
259000	261000	So, good times.
261000	265000	Black Wolf is clarifying in chat there was no bondage.
265000	266000	I don't know where that came from.
266000	268000	I think some of our chatters are going there.
268000	269000	I just said bonding.
269000	270000	Literally, you know.
270000	271000	Bonding.
271000	272000	It was that episode.
272000	273000	No, I'm just kidding.
273000	274000	Anyhow.
274000	275000	Alright, so how was your Penny Arcade Expo Dark Soccer?
275000	279000	I know we usually start with how was your gaming week, but seeing as Penny Arcade Expo was such a...
279000	281000	We'll get to gaming week post packs later.
281000	282000	How was your Penny Arcade Expo?
282000	284000	What kind of stuff did you see at the show that you enjoyed?
284000	286000	Walk us through your time at Penny Arcade Expo a little bit.
286000	292000	Well, I was in a daze, you know, that Friday because I was just all like pretty shiny.
292000	293000	Namco.
293000	295000	Hang out with Namco for an hour.
295000	299000	You know, and they were just selling stuff, but I was like, dude, I don't care because it's Namco.
299000	301000	And I went in a Dig Dug plushie and couldn't get one.
301000	303000	Did you miss the memo that Namco hates us?
303000	304000	Katamari?
304000	305000	Remember that?
305000	306000	Ah, forget it.
306000	307000	So?
307000	308000	I'm kidding.
308000	309000	I love Namco.
309000	311000	I worked for them, sort of, at the arcade.
311000	319000	But at any rate, actually, you know, we did the rounds of the room when it was press only
319000	321000	and that was pretty cool.
321000	327000	I liked that it was very relaxed, at least for those few hours.
327000	328000	I saw things that I liked.
328000	334000	I didn't play too much just because I was mostly observing and I could get a feel for
334000	335000	it just by watching people.
335000	338000	I played a few things myself.
338000	341000	I really, really like Little Big Planet.
341000	343000	I thought that was pretty cool.
343000	345000	I liked what I saw of Spore.
345000	348000	We're probably going to get it eventually.
348000	353000	I don't really have much time to play it, so it's whenever Dan gets it.
353000	359000	I actually liked Wii Music because I thought that it was just neat.
359000	365000	I thought that, you know, and I like, I'm one of those people who likes finding, you
365000	370000	know, MIDI programs and then redoing all the instruments in the MIDI to sound completely
370000	371000	bizarre.
371000	378000	So, actually, one of the things that I liked about Wii Music is that it just had that playing
378000	382000	with MIDI tones type of thing to it.
382000	387000	Animal Crossing, it was Animal Crossing.
387000	389000	I really liked the Wario game.
389000	392000	That one was kind of cool.
392000	397000	I went over to hang out with, okay, was it EA?
397000	398000	No, it wasn't EA.
398000	400000	EA had some of the crap.
400000	403000	Just so you know, Bobby just disowned you because you like Wii Music.
403000	405000	I didn't say that I was going to play it.
405000	409000	I just thought it was neat.
409000	412000	You know, this comes from my old, you know, old, what was my third major?
412000	414000	Music major, right?
414000	416000	So, I think I'm on major number 12 now.
416000	419000	I would be all over Wii Music if I was 12.
419000	421000	Yeah, I thought it was neat.
421000	425000	I thought it was, it would be something that would be fun to waste some time with, I thought.
425000	426000	At any rate.
426000	427000	I gotta say this.
427000	431000	Black Wolf just said, I liked and Wii Music do not belong in the same sentence unless
431000	435000	in the context of I liked to hate on Wii Music.
435000	439000	You know, I think we said this in an earlier show when we first talked about Wii Music.
439000	443000	If it gets kids into real music, it's a good thing, regardless.
443000	444000	See, that's what I think.
444000	449000	It's a great platform, you know, into learning a bit more.
449000	451000	I mean, because really it teaches tempo.
451000	454000	It teaches a little bit of arrangement.
454000	457000	I thought, you know, I thought it's a neat little concept.
457000	461000	You know, I would have totally loved to have something like this when I was little.
461000	467000	I played Mario Paint, you know, but at any rate, moving forward.
467000	473000	I also liked talking with the guy that they interviewed for Guitar Hero.
473000	478000	He was pretty cool, and I'm really, really looking forward to the studio mode.
478000	482000	I mean, really looking forward to the studio mode, and I was reminded of that by thinking
482000	484000	of Mario Paint.
484000	486000	You know, people making their own music and everything.
486000	487000	I think it would be fantastic.
487000	489000	I'm really, really looking forward to that.
489000	496000	I played the game that I always forget the name of that you play as a sushi plate.
496000	499000	I'm going to get the name of it off of my phone again just because I took a picture
499000	504000	because I could not remember the name of it because it was so bizarre.
504000	507000	Sushi Bumper Sumo Fun Game.
507000	514000	And as I was saying earlier when Bobby called in, you play as a sushi plate,
514000	516000	and you have to keep the other piece of sushi away from the others,
516000	520000	and they can knock you into the conveyor belt, and you lose a piece of sushi.
520000	524000	And whoever holds onto the sushi for the longest time within two minutes
524000	526000	gets a higher score and wins.
526000	528000	That's basically keep away with sushi.
528000	534000	And it was a really fun, weird little game, and from what I understand,
534000	541000	it's supposed to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, so I'm looking forward to that.
541000	546000	I really, really wish I had ear plugs for all the people who couldn't sing
546000	550000	that were playing rock band and guitar hero because, I mean,
550000	552000	you've got a bar telling you when you're out of tune
552000	555000	you should actually pay attention to it.
555000	556000	I'm sorry.
556000	560000	I don't know if I've said so before on the show, but I hear Perfect Pitch,
560000	567000	which drove me nuts in band, but I really can't filter out.
567000	570000	That's why I don't like to sing in front of people because I can hear it in myself.
570000	572000	That's why I don't sing.
572000	577000	At any rate, other stuff that I saw that was really cool was Pink Godzilla
577000	580000	because I bought stuff from Pink Godzilla.
580000	584000	For anyone who doesn't know, my anniversary was on the 1st.
584000	586000	Dan and I have been married for three years,
586000	589000	and I bought him his anniversary present from Pink Godzilla.
589000	594000	I got him a salamander pack for a PSP.
594000	595000	That's nerd love right there.
595000	596000	That is nerd love.
596000	599000	Well, he got me an iPod that he got for free.
599000	603000	He regifted? He regifted for your anniversary?
603000	604000	That's fine. I don't care.
604000	606000	At least it's an iPod.
606000	611000	It's a little in red, and it says the GameStop special edition or some shit on it.
611000	616000	But anyway, other fun stuff.
616000	619000	I liked hanging out with the Commando 3 people.
619000	620000	They were kind of cool.
620000	621000	Actually, they were really cool.
621000	628000	I actually went to talk to some of the digital design students.
628000	634000	You can't do this in Wii music, but you can do it in Mario Paint.
634000	641000	That's actually a pretty decent little arrangement.
641000	644000	Where's my bucket so I can roll it at you?
644000	646000	Sorry. Couldn't resist.
646000	647000	Anyway.
647000	649000	Wii music will never have the greatness of the Mario Paint.
649000	650000	Mario Paint was fantastic.
650000	653000	We need Mario Paint, the sequel.
653000	658000	Mario Paint 2, Electric Boogaloo.
658000	661000	Other stuff that I saw slash played or did.
661000	667000	I was mentioning, I was talking to a lot of the digital design schools that try to get people to sign up for their schools.
667000	675000	They really actually got a lot of good tips for myself as far as things to study in my current major.
675000	677000	They were all like, we'd prefer you to go to our school.
677000	681000	But there's a few of them that were actually beginning transfer programs.
681000	683000	That's kind of looking into. There's one in Sunnyvale.
683000	688000	And that would just be really cool because then I'd be close to Capcom's testing grounds and that would be sweet.
688000	693000	Also, trying out all the fun restaurants.
693000	697000	Going to Gameworks, which was oddly disappointing because I couldn't win that Tales out of the Crane game.
697000	702000	And there was an incredible, incredible lack of Planet Harriers.
702000	709000	So I wanted to cry in sub-tears of disappointment for having no Planet Harrier.
709000	716000	Because Planet Harrier is one of the greatest arcade games ever. Ever.
716000	721000	What? Rob's looking like he's up to something, everybody.
721000	724000	No, they just wanted to link to the YouTube and chat.
724000	728000	So I just put it in there in true Mario Paint Roll fashion.
728000	731000	I put, dude, this YouTube is so cool and then put the link.
731000	733000	So we'll see how many people click it.
733000	739000	Well, I also played, actually I was very surprised about how much I liked it.
739000	742000	I played the Ninja Gaiden demo on DS.
742000	749000	And it was really, really cool, but there was another DS demo that actually was really freaking fun.
749000	751000	And that was the Arkanoid demo.
751000	757000	I used to play Arkanoid back in the day on the old, you know, Gamebrick.
757000	760000	The old Gameboy. And that was pretty fun.
760000	764000	I saw people playing WonderSwan and I wished I had brought my WonderSwan.
764000	766000	Oh, I wish I had brought mine too.
766000	768000	Oh, I would have had a WonderSwan party.
768000	769000	That would have been great.
769000	770000	It would have been wonderful.
770000	776000	I saw a couple Neo Geo Pocket colors and I, you know, I had actually come this close.
776000	781000	And for anyone not looking, it's about a millimeter, my fingers are apart, from bringing my Turbo Express.
781000	787000	Because actually I saw someone playing a Duo LT.
787000	790000	For anyone who doesn't know, the Duo LT is freaking expensive!
790000	792000	Expensive!
792000	796000	That's something awesome to bring to the handheld lounge at Penny Arcade Expo.
796000	798000	Because usually it's, you know, DSes, a few PSPs.
798000	802000	But to bring like a freaking, you know, portable Neo Geo would be awesome.
802000	806000	Well, the Duo LT, and I'll find a Wikipedia page to link to everybody.
806000	810000	Basically it's the Turbo Graphics Duo laptop.
810000	812000	Which had its own little screen and everything.
812000	814000	Really freaking expensive.
814000	816000	And I saw someone who had one.
816000	821000	And then I got to meet my musical hero, Jonathan Coulton.
821000	824000	And I got to meet my geek hero, Wil Wheaton.
824000	825000	Good times.
825000	827000	And I had a fan-gasm both times.
827000	829000	So you had a great PAX, it sounds like.
829000	830000	Hell yeah!
830000	832000	How did it compare to the E3 of old that we used to go to?
832000	834000	Because a lot of people were saying, PAX is the new E3!
834000	836000	No, PAX is not the new E3.
836000	842000	Imagine, and it's like I kept wanting to call it a con.
842000	844000	Because it felt like going to a freaking convention.
844000	849000	I mean, like, the show floor or whatever was like half dealer's room anyway.
849000	852000	And it was just really fun.
852000	856000	There were the free game panels, there were movies, there were performances.
856000	859000	This wasn't like E3, this was a freaking convention.
859000	860000	That's what this was.
860000	861000	This wasn't...
861000	866000	E3 is a media, you know, spectacle, I should say.
866000	875000	PAX is, it's like an anime con, but just video games.
875000	879000	I would like to say to all of you folks that went to Penny Arcade Expo,
879000	882000	I'm quite proud of the majority of you for knowing how to bathe properly.
882000	884000	I know!
884000	886000	It was actually a pretty pleasant smelling.
886000	889000	I mean, don't get me wrong, there were a few people that smelled like fart.
889000	892000	But some people, the most people...
892000	893000	It's the gym sock syndrome.
893000	895000	You can tell who's been sleeping in the lounge.
895000	898000	Most people were very well bathed, and I appreciate it.
898000	901000	And all the All Games people were well, well bathed.
901000	903000	So thank you all.
903000	905000	I really, I just really had a good time.
905000	906000	You know what, it felt a lot...
906000	908000	Except for DMN.
908000	909000	Dirty bastard.
909000	911000	It felt a lot like going to Fauna Mae.
911000	913000	Is that the impression that you got?
913000	914000	Kinda.
914000	915000	It was really laid back.
915000	918000	But it was All Games, so I felt like I understood it.
918000	919000	I felt like it was...
919000	920000	It was the most of Fauna Mae.
920000	922000	And on top of that, I thought that it was very well organized
922000	924000	as far as getting into some of the events,
924000	927000	though I didn't go to the one event I wanted to go to.
927000	928000	Well, that and the Nerdcore Rising.
928000	931000	I got to see MC Frontalot, but I didn't mind anything from him.
931000	932000	Oh well.
932000	936000	Anyway, but it was just really, I thought, well organized
936000	938000	and how they had everything together.
938000	940000	And it gave everybody a fair opportunity.
940000	944000	So that was even what impressed me a whole lot more.
944000	945000	That and there was some cosplay.
945000	946000	Oh my God.
946000	948000	It was very convention-like.
948000	950000	Except there was some really shitty cosplay.
950000	952000	And whoever that was who cosplayed the bride
952000	955000	who wasn't wearing underwear, you need to eat a steak, girl.
955000	956000	I'm sorry.
956000	957000	I could see...
957000	962000	When you can see someone's pelvic bones, their hips,
962000	966000	no, that's the sign that somebody needs to freaking sit down
966000	970000	with a porterhouse and chow down.
970000	971000	Sorry.
971000	972000	And nobody wants to see your ass.
972000	973000	Thank you.
973000	974000	All right.
974000	977000	I'll try to keep my pack stuff short.
977000	978000	I mean, Jamie hit on most of it.
978000	980000	I had a lot of fun broadcasting with the All Games crew.
980000	982000	You know, the seven or eight hours we were doing it.
982000	985000	And just getting to meet people and hang out with people.
985000	987000	You know, the show four kind of came and went.
987000	989000	Thank God we got to go in there a little bit early
989000	991000	and kind of take everything in and actually get to play things.
991000	993000	To kind of echo some of the games,
993000	995000	Dark Sakura talked about Wii music.
995000	997000	I'm still not as huge of a fan of.
997000	1000000	But again, if I look at it from the angle of a seven-year-old
1000000	1003000	might play this game and decide they want to play real drums,
1003000	1004000	I'm okay with it.
1004000	1006000	But me, I'm not going to buy it.
1006000	1012000	Animal Crossing has the potential to be neat or really, really stale.
1012000	1014000	And right now it's feeling a little stale.
1014000	1017000	So I just really hope the internet functionality is built in there
1017000	1018000	the way we're all dreaming of
1018000	1020000	because that's going to be what saves this game.
1020000	1023000	The Wario Land game was great too.
1023000	1026000	But, you know, obviously that's something we've kind of already seen here in studio
1026000	1028000	if you've been paying attention on the last few episodes.
1028000	1031000	As far as other stuff that Jamie didn't talk about
1031000	1033000	because I don't think it's quite up her alley,
1033000	1035000	Warhammer Online I got to check out a little bit.
1035000	1036000	We had a booth set up there.
1036000	1039000	And, you know, the folks behind Warhammer Online
1039000	1044000	are very adamant that we're not WoW, we're not WoW, we're not trying to be WoW.
1044000	1048000	WoW is, you know, the Beatles and we're Led Zeppelin and all this stuff,
1048000	1049000	which is cool.
1049000	1054000	But the demo that they had there was leveling up the first few levels
1054000	1055000	like starting a new character.
1055000	1058000	And I felt that when you were starting a new character
1058000	1062000	it kind of played like WoW to me, which isn't a bad thing.
1062000	1063000	WoW is a great formula.
1063000	1066000	And, you know, it has slightly nicer graphics
1066000	1068000	and it, you know, kind of tracks your quests a little differently.
1068000	1071000	And, of course, naturally you have different classes, different races.
1071000	1072000	So it's not the exact same as WoW.
1072000	1075000	But I just would have liked to have seen a little more on the floor.
1075000	1077000	I understand they showed some of this in panels,
1077000	1081000	but, you know, those were impossible to get into without waiting forever.
1081000	1084000	I would like to see a little more how the Realm vs. Realm combat works
1084000	1087000	because I feel like I only kind of partially understand it from what I heard.
1087000	1089000	So I'm looking forward to seeing more of that.
1089000	1091000	And I realized, yeah, I could go online, look at more of that stuff.
1091000	1093000	But I was just kind of hoping to see that on the show floor,
1093000	1095000	especially when they're trying to really differentiate themselves.
1095000	1097000	But I had fun with the game. That's what's important, right?
1097000	1099000	I'll probably pick it up.
1099000	1103000	LittleBigPlanet. Loved it. Loved it. Game of the show for me, honestly.
1103000	1107000	I was very surprised at just really how good Sony's booth was,
1107000	1108000	all things considered.
1108000	1111000	I actually thought the games Sony was showing
1111000	1114000	was probably better than the stuff Nintendo was showing on a whole.
1114000	1117000	Although, I don't know, the Wario Land game was pretty awesome, too.
1117000	1120000	But I just really liked LittleBigPlanet
1120000	1123000	and I never realized the party game potential that this game has.
1123000	1128000	And the editor looks great. I'm definitely interested in this game.
1128000	1131000	As well, some of the other things Sony was showing, not bad.
1131000	1134000	You know, MotorStorm 2 looked pretty interesting
1134000	1137000	and they were showing off the new SingStar and Buzz throughout the day.
1137000	1139000	SingStar looked fun. I didn't get a chance to play it, though.
1139000	1143000	You know, I was kind of impressed by Sony.
1143000	1146000	They're really starting to redeem themselves a little bit, I think.
1146000	1151000	Also, other games I played, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe
1151000	1153000	kind of surprised me being on the show floor.
1153000	1155000	And Dark Soccer and I actually did play a round of that.
1155000	1157000	I played Katana. She played Catwoman.
1157000	1159000	Oh, yeah, that's right. We did play that. It was fun!
1159000	1160000	It was kind of fun.
1160000	1163000	You know, I said this when I was trying to summarize the show in my Live Journal.
1163000	1167000	It's never going to be as great as Marvel vs. Capcom.
1167000	1171000	You know, and Mortal Kombat has always been a little bit of a,
1171000	1174000	I don't know, not so serious, at least to me,
1174000	1177000	especially in any Mortal Kombat game since 2.
1177000	1179000	It just played so much like the others.
1179000	1184000	Well, it's not like a real hardcore fighting game.
1184000	1187000	It's more of a game that seems to not take itself so seriously,
1187000	1190000	at least in my mind. You know what I mean?
1190000	1193000	And I think the trend continues here with DC Universe.
1193000	1195000	You really are just kind of taking out Mortal Kombat characters
1195000	1198000	and putting in DC Universe characters instead, but it's the same engine.
1198000	1201000	I don't think it's a game anyone's going to remember years from now
1201000	1205000	that they have such praise on, but was it a lot of big dumb fun?
1205000	1209000	Yeah! I think it's going to be a fun game that a lot of college dorm kids are going to eat up.
1209000	1213000	Catwoman's attack was totally like the blood rain attack except she used her claws.
1213000	1215000	Yeah. Very cool.
1215000	1217000	Oh! One thing I forgot, if you don't mind.
1217000	1218000	Sure, go ahead.
1218000	1221000	I played D&D 4th edition like a big freaking nerd.
1221000	1222000	You are a big nerd.
1222000	1223000	It was great.
1223000	1226000	And then let's see, there's another game at PAX.
1226000	1229000	Puzzle Quest Galactrix, I'll say really quickly I got to play a little bit of.
1229000	1231000	They had that playable on the show floor.
1231000	1234000	And you just have to really think it's not like Bejeweled anymore.
1234000	1239000	I mean, it is, but now it's on a hexagon, which completely changes the way you have to think about the game.
1239000	1241000	But I enjoy myself with that game.
1241000	1243000	I just hope it's not too...
1243000	1247000	I mean, well, I'm kind of thinking, you know, I hope it's not too much of the same,
1247000	1250000	but they really did try to mix it up with, you know, putting it on the hexagon
1250000	1252000	and kind of giving it the space theme.
1252000	1254000	I think it'll be kind of cool.
1254000	1258000	I was very disappointed though that they were showing a trailer for Star Trek Online on the floor,
1258000	1259000	but not any actual gameplay.
1259000	1260000	That didn't make me disappointed.
1260000	1262000	That made my heart hurt because I'm totally going to play that.
1262000	1263000	Yeah, me too.
1263000	1264000	I was hoping to see a little more on that.
1264000	1265000	But I understand.
1265000	1266000	It's early.
1266000	1267000	It's early.
1267000	1268000	I'm not hating.
1268000	1271000	It's just, you know, it got my hopes up only to be crushed by disappointment.
1271000	1276000	And one more game I'll mention, the Iron Chef game I played.
1276000	1278000	I avoided it.
1278000	1281000	It's not as horrible as you'd think.
1281000	1283000	I hear it's only a $20 game, which might not be bad.
1283000	1285000	Iron Chef America is crap.
1285000	1287000	It is, but it plays like Cooking Mama.
1287000	1289000	But actually responsive.
1289000	1291000	Because Cooking Mama on the Wii was pretty atrocious.
1291000	1293000	But Iron Chef felt okay.
1293000	1296000	I don't think it's going to have any real long-term playability.
1296000	1300000	But if it's only $20, that's how much a lot of arcade titles are.
1300000	1302000	I think it'll be a lot of big, dumb fun.
1302000	1304000	I did like how you could garnish your plate.
1304000	1305000	That was kind of fun.
1305000	1306000	I like that.
1306000	1309000	Well, I guess part of it is presentation.
1309000	1311000	Yeah.
1311000	1313000	Yeah, it is cool.
1313000	1315000	I'm looking at comments from chat.
1315000	1318000	The Rob D. says, Iron Mama, in a way.
1318000	1319000	Let's see.
1319000	1321000	I'm looking at other comments from chat here.
1321000	1326000	chat.orangelaunchradio.com, if you want to add some things to the chat.
1326000	1328000	I can't say this name.
1328000	1330000	K-H-A-S-N, Kossen.
1330000	1331000	I don't know if that's how you say it.
1331000	1333000	The game looks bad.
1333000	1337000	The graphics aren't stellar, but it is on the Wii, which, you know,
1337000	1339000	doesn't really do the high-def stuff so well.
1339000	1341000	A game is only...
1341000	1342000	Games...
1342000	1344000	Play it first.
1344000	1346000	A game with crappy graphics can still be fun.
1346000	1348000	Look at the old Atari 2600 games.
1348000	1350000	Unless it's E.T.
1350000	1353000	Again, it's not going to be anything you're going to remember for a lifetime,
1353000	1356000	but for 20 bucks, it's a good waste of time.
1356000	1359000	I guess that's all I really want to say about PAX.
1359000	1360000	How was your gaming week?
1360000	1363000	I'll talk some more about the whole PAX broadcast and all that
1363000	1365000	in just a little bit when we get to housekeeping.
1365000	1368000	I do want to say, though, how was your gaming week after PAX?
1368000	1370000	Did you play anything post-Pax that you want to talk about?
1370000	1371000	Oh, Ragnarok.
1371000	1375000	And I played a stellar game of Black Knight 2000 pinball.
1375000	1378000	For the record, we are selling our Black Knight 2000 pinball.
1378000	1380000	Oh, are you disappointed about that, or is it time?
1380000	1381000	We want a little bit better playfield.
1381000	1382000	Oh, okay.
1382000	1385000	We're also selling our Star Trek The Next Generation pinball.
1385000	1388000	Because, again, we want a better table.
1388000	1391000	Alright, well, as long as you get it back, because I love Next Generation.
1391000	1394000	And any listener who is willing to trade across the board,
1394000	1400000	we will trade our Creature from the Black Lagoon for a Lord of the Rings pinball, please.
1400000	1403000	I'm making a mention on behalf of my husband,
1403000	1406000	because I really don't care for Creature from the Black Lagoon, anyway.
1406000	1412000	But, no, I did play a lot of...
1412000	1418000	I actually did play a lot of Solitaire, just because I have that kind of time,
1418000	1420000	which is not really...
1420000	1422000	So, that's about it.
1422000	1426000	I'm in school, so it's not like I have time to really do a lot of playing.
1426000	1427000	That's cool.
1427000	1430000	I played a lot of Rock Band and Guitar Hero this week.
1430000	1435000	I went back to kind of milk the last little bit out of those games that I'm going to
1435000	1436000	before the new sequels come out,
1436000	1439000	because we're only a few days away from Guitar Hero World Tour
1439000	1441000	and Rock Band 2 coming out,
1441000	1444000	so I'm just kind of squeezing the last little bit out of those games,
1444000	1447000	because, yeah, I plan to export the Rock Band tracks and then get rid of the game.
1447000	1451000	I mean, even if I only get a few bucks for it, I'll take it,
1451000	1453000	because I don't really plan to play it much longer.
1453000	1455000	But I'll tell you what bugs me about Rock Band.
1455000	1457000	You freaking people that play online matches,
1457000	1459000	like in score battle or what have you,
1459000	1461000	and then when I'm beating you,
1461000	1464000	and I'm about to win the song with like 20,000 points over you,
1464000	1467000	you freaking quit, so I don't get credit for the song.
1467000	1468000	I hate that.
1468000	1471000	I have been leaving negative feedback, though, on people to do that,
1471000	1473000	because that pisses me off, and I encourage people to do that.
1473000	1475000	Don't forget, like, if people quit early,
1475000	1478000	because they can't suck it up that someone beat them at the game,
1478000	1481000	freaking leave them a negative review so it does affect their little score,
1481000	1483000	because I think that is such bullcrap.
1483000	1487000	And Rock Band should automatically register that as a loss,
1487000	1489000	but for whatever reason they didn't think to do that,
1489000	1492000	and it doesn't, so it just kind of ticked me off.
1492000	1494000	And Black Wolf is correcting me in chat saying,
1494000	1496000	World Tour doesn't come out until October 26th.
1496000	1498000	Yeah, I'm thinking of Rock Band, though.
1498000	1500000	Rock Band is just a few more days.
1500000	1503000	I did actually have another edition of my gaming week.
1503000	1505000	I received a game.
1505000	1508000	My wonderful husband has finally brought me home.
1508000	1510000	The world ends with you, so I'm going to be playing that.
1510000	1511000	Oh, cool.
1511000	1512000	Finally!
1512000	1513000	When you beat that, I want to borrow it.
1513000	1514000	I'm going to go and check that out.
1514000	1516000	You will be first in line.
1516000	1518000	Ssj100matt in chat, chat.orangessauceredo.com,
1518000	1520000	says, I leave negative feedback all the time.
1520000	1523000	You know, and I'm also a believer in positive feedback, too.
1523000	1525000	You know, if you actually chat with somebody and they're not going,
1525000	1527000	you know, cock, cock, fag, fag, you know,
1527000	1530000	all that stuff that people do on Xbox Live,
1530000	1531000	I think if, you know, there's decent people,
1531000	1533000	you should leave positive feedback so you play with them again.
1533000	1534000	I've done that, too.
1534000	1537000	I think not enough people are using that system,
1537000	1539000	and it's our way to kind of filter out the a-holes,
1539000	1541000	so you definitely should make use of that.
1541000	1543000	Don't forget that that feature's there to you,
1543000	1544000	and if you don't know how to use it,
1544000	1546000	just hit your little guide button after you play a match with someone,
1546000	1549000	and go to the option that's not your friends list or your messages,
1549000	1550000	but it's all the way on the right side.
1550000	1553000	It'll show you, like, the last 100 people you've played a game with,
1553000	1556000	and so you can just click on the Personally Feedback right there.
1556000	1557000	It's awesome.
1557000	1558000	There you go.
1558000	1560000	This person sucks ass.
1560000	1562000	Yeah, sadly, you can't filter down that good,
1562000	1565000	but you can leave the reason why you're putting them on your frown list.
1565000	1567000	There's a smile list and a frown list,
1567000	1570000	and if you want to mark their frown because they quit early,
1570000	1571000	you can do that,
1571000	1573000	and so I've done that for you rock band fools.
1573000	1575000	I'm going to start reading names on the show
1575000	1577000	of gamertags that have quit out on me.
1577000	1578000	Do it.
1578000	1579000	I'm going to.
1579000	1581000	In fact, I'll look up the name while you're reading the next story
1581000	1582000	and call them out here on the program.
1582000	1584000	That'll be fun.
1584000	1585000	I do want to say, though,
1585000	1587000	as far as other games I've been playing this week,
1587000	1588000	you know, besides usual World of Warcraft,
1588000	1590000	I did pick up Spore.
1590000	1592000	I have the box sitting right here.
1592000	1595000	I'm excited, but I'm hoping the hype hasn't killed this game
1595000	1599000	because I'm hearing a lot of people are thinking this was not worth the wait,
1599000	1600000	but I don't know.
1600000	1601000	We'll see.
1601000	1602000	We'll see.
1602000	1604000	I'm going to hold off on my opinion until I get a chance to play it myself.
1604000	1605000	I do have the box sitting right here.
1605000	1607000	I'm going to install that after the show tonight.
1607000	1610000	I just didn't have time to get around to it today.
1610000	1611000	Go ahead.
1611000	1612000	What?
1612000	1613000	Xbox Live Arcade.
1613000	1615000	I checked out Gin Rummy.
1615000	1617000	The presentation of that game is actually really nice.
1617000	1620000	I just wish there was more to it than just Gin Rummy
1620000	1622000	because I think there's, you know,
1622000	1625000	Sierra, our masters, doing card games on the computer and such,
1625000	1628000	so it's kind of nice to see them getting into it on Xbox Live Arcade.
1628000	1630000	I just wish there had been a little more to it,
1630000	1633000	and I just didn't feel like the price justified it
1633000	1637000	because I know this sounds harsh, but I could get a real deck of cards.
1637000	1639000	Then again, I could say the same thing about Uno,
1639000	1641000	but yet Uno is so much fun on Xbox Live.
1641000	1643000	I can't explain what it is, the difference.
1643000	1646000	Maybe, I don't know, maybe it's the fact more people are on Uno
1646000	1648000	or that Uno is so disgustingly simple
1648000	1650000	and you can literally just sit down and play for five minutes
1650000	1652000	and Rummy takes a little more time.
1652000	1653000	I don't know.
1653000	1655000	How about Rock Band Stuff?
1655000	1656000	How about Rock Band Stuff?
1656000	1658000	There is actually a Rock Band two-track list
1658000	1660000	that is ranked by difficulty for Xbox 360.
1660000	1662000	Hold on, hold on, we're not in Stories yet. Hold on, sorry.
1662000	1664000	Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you already did yours.
1664000	1665000	No, no, no, no.
1665000	1667000	I don't know why I'm...
1667000	1668000	I've got to get to housekeeping.
1668000	1670000	You know, I thought that you had read your story
1670000	1671000	and I completely blanked, so I'm sorry.
1671000	1672000	No, because we're starting with a Rock Band story tonight.
1672000	1673000	That's okay.
1673000	1674000	Because I thought that you...
1674000	1676000	That's all right. I'm done with my gaming week.
1676000	1678000	Let's do housekeeping and then we can talk about Rock Band, okay?
1678000	1679000	Can I go call under the couch now?
1679000	1681000	No, you're fine, you're fine.
1681000	1682000	Housekeeping tonight.
1682000	1686000	I wanted to mention of Penny Arcade coverage,
1686000	1688000	the seven hours, eight hours worth of stuff
1688000	1690000	we did at Penny Arcade Expo is up.
1690000	1691000	It was really Bobby that did it all,
1691000	1692000	because he was there the whole time.
1692000	1693000	But we...
1693000	1695000	At least I pretty much was there all day Friday
1695000	1696000	and all day Saturday.
1696000	1698000	Dark Soccer and Loki spent pretty much
1698000	1700000	all their time there too.
1700000	1701000	So check that out.
1701000	1704000	Pax.allgames.com is there
1704000	1706000	and that's where you can actually get now
1706000	1708000	some video is being posted as well
1708000	1710000	of the interviews that Bobby did.
1710000	1711000	He actually has some interviews
1711000	1713000	and I think I showed up in the first one.
1713000	1715000	I asked a question of the Jumpgate Evolution guy.
1715000	1717000	So it's there and you can download it
1717000	1718000	and it's neat.
1718000	1719000	Bobby did a very good job with the videos.
1719000	1720000	I was very happy.
1720000	1724000	E for All is the next expo on the radar
1724000	1726000	and sadly all three of us are not going to be
1726000	1728000	going to E for All, but I am.
1728000	1729000	I'm going to go for E for All
1729000	1730000	to represent Orange Lawns Radio
1730000	1732000	and I know a lot of folks might be thinking why.
1732000	1734000	E for All does not appear to be having
1734000	1737000	the big exhibitor list of other conventions
1737000	1739000	and to me I actually think
1739000	1740000	that's kind of the charm of it.
1740000	1742000	I want to go and promote Orange Lawns Radio
1742000	1744000	to the gamers that will show up
1744000	1746000	and from what I hear All Games
1746000	1748000	is going to have a heck of a booth there.
1748000	1750000	Their theme has to do with classic games.
1750000	1752000	I'm not sure how much I can and can't say
1752000	1754000	about the booth, but from what I've heard
1754000	1755000	it's going to be a good time.
1755000	1756000	So if you're in the LA area
1756000	1758000	you should come out and check us out at E for All.
1758000	1759000	I will be there.
1759000	1763000	Also, best for last,
1763000	1766000	OLRPSP.com, especially for you kids
1766000	1768000	that listen to Orange Lawns Radio on your PSP.
1768000	1769000	If you have not checked this out yet,
1769000	1770000	you've got to see this.
1770000	1773000	On OLRPSP.com, Loki launched,
1773000	1775000	just in time for Penny Arcade Expo,
1775000	1777000	the All Games Radio Player.
1777000	1779000	You actually download it to your crossbar.
1779000	1781000	It's not spam or anything, don't worry.
1781000	1783000	There's no ads or anything like that.
1783000	1785000	What you do, you can actually listen
1785000	1787000	to All Games Radio right from your crossbar.
1787000	1789000	It takes you right to this fancy player
1789000	1791000	that is awesome.
1791000	1792000	You've just got to see it.
1792000	1793000	You don't have to try and figure out
1793000	1795000	the radio tuner that's built in
1795000	1796000	that's really horrible trying to find
1796000	1797000	All Games on it or anything.
1797000	1800000	You can just go 6 o'clock Sunday night,
1800000	1801000	or heck, if you want to tune in
1801000	1802000	to some of the other programming,
1802000	1805000	tune in at 4.45 p.m. Pacific Sunday night.
1805000	1808000	Go on your PSP to the Orange Lawns Radio
1808000	1810000	All Games listener, and you go right
1810000	1812000	to All Games Radio and listen to everything.
1812000	1813000	It's great.
1813000	1814000	Check it out.
1814000	1816000	I can say how great it is without
1816000	1817000	sounding like I have an ego,
1817000	1818000	because Loki did it all.
1818000	1820000	He really did a great job,
1820000	1822000	not just for us representing Orange Lawns Radio,
1822000	1824000	but for representing allgames.com.
1824000	1826000	Plus, he let out a series of colorful expletives
1826000	1827000	while he was working on it,
1827000	1828000	and that was pretty funny.
1828000	1829000	Yes, it was funny to watch.
1829000	1831000	So, good times.
1831000	1833000	So check that out, OLRPSP.com.
1833000	1836000	Also, we're trying something new tonight.
1836000	1838000	OChat28 is giving an endorsement.
1838000	1840000	It says the PSP All Games Radio
1840000	1841000	is pretty damn cool.
1841000	1842000	chat.orangelawnsradio.com.
1842000	1843000	Tonight we're trying something new.
1843000	1845000	Since it is just Dark Soccer and myself
1845000	1846000	here in the studio,
1846000	1848000	our Skype line is going to be open all night.
1848000	1849000	We're going to take calls
1849000	1850000	as we get them tonight.
1850000	1851000	We're trying something new.
1851000	1853000	If you feel at any time you want to call in
1853000	1854000	and give us a call,
1854000	1855000	comment on what's going on.
1855000	1857000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
1857000	1858000	800 numbers back tonight.
1858000	1859000	Or our username on Skype,
1859000	1861000	Orange Lawns Radio.
1861000	1862000	So we're not going to have a special segment
1862000	1863000	at the end of the show.
1863000	1864000	Instead, we hope you guys will tune in
1864000	1866000	when you have something to say
1866000	1867000	about one of the stories going on tonight.
1867000	1869000	And we'll see how it goes.
1869000	1871000	But please keep in mind that
1871000	1872000	we don't want the same people to call in
1872000	1873000	over and over and over again.
1873000	1875000	So once you've gotten through once,
1875000	1878000	please let some other people through.
1878000	1879000	Okay.
1879000	1880000	So, yeah.
1880000	1881000	At any time you can give us a call.
1881000	1882000	Skype line is open right now.
1882000	1883000	I'll be reminding you of the number
1883000	1884000	throughout the show.
1884000	1886000	Now we can get into some gaming news.
1886000	1887000	Okay?
1887000	1889000	And we'll start with some Rock Band.
1889000	1890000	I know you're really surprised.
1890000	1892000	I'm still going to go hide under the couch.
1892000	1893000	That's alright.
1893000	1894000	As long as you're playing Rock Band.
1894000	1898000	Rock Band released a Penny Arcade Expo pack this week.
1898000	1901000	It is $3 or 240 Microsoft points.
1901000	1903000	And what's pretty cool about it,
1903000	1905000	all of the proceeds are going to the Child's Play charity.
1905000	1907000	Which, you know, Gabe and Tycho at Penny Arcade,
1907000	1908000	they love that.
1908000	1910000	And the other cool thing,
1910000	1913000	the performers in the PAX pack
1913000	1915000	were actually people that were at Penny Arcade Expo.
1915000	1918000	So even if you were not there live at the show,
1918000	1922000	it's kind of like you could have PAX in your house a little bit.
1922000	1924000	And you can play along to Skullcrusher Mountain
1924000	1925000	by Jonathan Colton,
1925000	1928000	which you've got to love that here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1928000	1929000	We've talked about that before.
1929000	1932000	Living on the Corner of Dude and Catastrophe by MC Frontalot
1932000	1934000	and Shh by Darkest of the Hillside.
1934000	1936000	I think it's three bucks.
1936000	1939000	Shh, by the way, is a previously unreleased track.
1939000	1941000	The other two songs have been released before
1941000	1942000	and they are all master recordings.
1942000	1945000	So if you have Rock Band and you want to feel good
1945000	1948000	about donating to Child's Play and get some music at the same time,
1948000	1949000	there you have it.
1949000	1951000	Rock Band, PAX pack.
1953000	1955000	I'm going to do my story now.
1955000	1958000	Yeah, so Gee, Dark Soccer, do you have anything you want to share with us?
1958000	1960000	Oh, stop making fun of me, okay?
1962000	1963000	You can't resist. It's my job.
1963000	1965000	Infinite Undiscovery has an ad on this.
1965000	1966000	No, I'm just kidding.
1967000	1968000	Oh yeah, that was pretty too.
1968000	1970000	I forgot to mention Infinite Undiscovery.
1970000	1971000	I bought it.
1971000	1973000	And I played it for an hour
1973000	1975000	and I was extremely disappointed
1975000	1977000	compared to what I played at PAX.
1977000	1980000	I thought at PAX, I had a good time at PAX,
1980000	1983000	but I really hated the opening of this game.
1983000	1986000	I think, God, the whole ogre chase thing
1986000	1987000	is not a way to start the game.
1987000	1988000	That was a horrible idea
1988000	1991000	and it really just made me disinterested almost in the whole thing.
1991000	1993000	It doesn't suck how like one poorly planned level
1993000	1995000	can just ruin an entire game.
1995000	1996000	I'm going to try and stick it out
1996000	1998000	and try to get to some of the parts I saw at Penny Arcade Expo,
1998000	2000000	but I was not happy with Infinite Undiscovery.
2000000	2001000	Anyhow, sorry, go ahead.
2001000	2004000	Alright, well, the song list that I mentioned before
2004000	2008000	in order of difficulty is, for Rock Band 2, sorry,
2008000	2011000	is Eye of the Tiger, Float On, Today, Hungry Like the Wolf,
2011000	2014000	Cool for Cats, Pretend We're Dead.
2014000	2015000	I love that song.
2015000	2017000	My Own Worst Enemy, One Step Closer,
2017000	2019000	We Got the Beat, That's What You Get, Rebel...
2019000	2021000	Wait, this is Guitar Difficulty, right?
2021000	2024000	Uh, it's, yeah, Guitar Difficulty, sorry.
2024000	2026000	Um, Rebel Girl, So What You Want,
2026000	2027000	that's actually pretty cool.
2027000	2031000	Um, the next level up is Drain You, New Kid in School,
2031000	2033000	Hello There, Lump, American Woman, that's fun.
2033000	2035000	I Was Wrong, Night in the Afternoon,
2035000	2036000	I love that song.
2036000	2038000	Um, Mountain Song, Man in the Box,
2038000	2040000	Our Truth, White Wedding,
2040000	2044000	and, uh, E Pro, Solid, Psycho Killer.
2044000	2048000	Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I meant, Solid is the third stage.
2048000	2051000	So, Psycho Killer, Spirit in the Sky, Kids in America,
2051000	2053000	Feel the Pain, oh, that's a good song too.
2053000	2055000	Give It Away, Conventional Lover,
2055000	2058000	A Jagged Gorgeous Winter, Bad Reputation,
2058000	2061000	Pump It Up, You Oughta Know, Go Your Own Way,
2061000	2063000	Welcome to the Neighborhood,
2063000	2066000	and then Moderate is, uh, PVA, Shooting Star, Living on a Prayer,
2066000	2069000	Deluxe, Girls Not Gray, One Way or Another,
2069000	2072000	Tangled Up in Blue, Alex Chilton,
2072000	2075000	um, Alive, The Middle, Aqua Lung,
2075000	2078000	dude, Aqua Lung, cool, Supreme Girl,
2078000	2081000	Challenging, we have, uh, Down with the Sickness,
2081000	2083000	Give It All, Where'd You Go, Come Out and Play,
2083000	2086000	Everlong, Pinball Wizard, that's also really cool,
2086000	2089000	Rob the President, Testify,
2089000	2092000	Uncontrollable Urge, Any Way You Want It, Round and Round,
2092000	2096000	Night Lies, and then, uh, what?
2096000	2099000	I was just gonna say, thank you, Harmonics, for the journey, I love you.
2099000	2102000	Nightmare Level, now I'm thinking of Doom,
2102000	2105000	you know, was the last one, Hurt Me Plenty, anyway.
2105000	2108000	But I don't wanna die.
2108000	2111000	Let There Be Rock, Alabama Getaway, Lazy Eye, Teenage Riot,
2111000	2114000	The Trees, Vault Edition, Carry On, Wayward Son,
2114000	2117000	um, Rockin' Me, Ace of Spades 08,
2117000	2120000	I somehow miss that Carry On, My Wayward Son
2120000	2123000	is in that game, that is awesome.
2123000	2126000	I'm sorry, this is good, I'm actually glad you're reading the whole list,
2126000	2129000	cause I forgot about how some of these songs are in rock band too,
2129000	2131000	it's gonna be pretty awesome. Yeah, that's why I just had to do the whole thing.
2131000	2134000	Spoon Man Makes Me Happy, um,
2134000	2137000	you know, before Chris Cornell damaged his voice and doesn't sound as awesome
2137000	2140000	as he used to, um, Almost Easy, Chop Suey,
2140000	2143000	Shackler's Revenge, and then Impossible Mode
2143000	2146000	is Master Exploder, Ramblin' Man,
2146000	2149000	Shoulder to the Plow, Get Clean,
2149000	2152000	Colony of Birchmen, Peace Cells,
2152000	2155000	Souls of Black, um,
2155000	2158000	Battery, Panic Attack, Visions, Painkiller,
2158000	2161000	so, there you go.
2161000	2164000	Now see, the only bummer is that a lot of the songs I really wanna play
2164000	2167000	are not in the difficult category, but that's okay,
2167000	2170000	you know, I understand, because they want the difficult songs to be the more
2170000	2173000	guitar, metal, stuff that I don't really listen to
2173000	2176000	usually, but man, as a whole,
2176000	2179000	that's probably my favorite, like, band game, and I'm counting
2179000	2182000	Guitar Heroes as band games, song list yet, I, I'm
2182000	2185000	very excited about this game, uh, Rock Band 2, and it's only
2185000	2188000	going to be, uh, a few days away. Uh,
2188000	2191000	Quiltipo in Chat says, Master Exploder will be an interesting song
2191000	2194000	to sing. I think if you actually look at the list for vocals,
2194000	2197000	Master Exploder's like, towards the easiest songs, I wonder
2197000	2200000	why. I'm curious what you guys think about the Rock Band 2
2200000	2203000	song list and the, uh, difficulties, 1877 Game
2203000	2206000	OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLondrio, I'm kinda
2206000	2209000	curious if people are actually gonna call, or if everybody's gonna wait till the end, like
2209000	2212000	usual. That's why this is an experiment tonight.
2212000	2215000	More Rock Band, I mean, we just have a
2215000	2218000	crapload of music game news tonight, especially, you know, as we're on the brink
2218000	2221000	of a Rock Band 2 being released, lots and lots of music game news
2221000	2224000	tonight, and, uh, the details are finally out for how you
2224000	2227000	are going to get your Rock Band 1 songs into Rock Band 2.
2227000	2230000	It is available to happen now, even though Rock Band 2
2230000	2233000	is not technically out yet, you can start the exporting process.
2233000	2236000	The whole process takes about 10 minutes, and it'll set you back
2236000	2239000	$5, and it'll allow you to take 55 songs,
2239000	2242000	take them out of Rock Band 1, and put them into Rock Band 2.
2242000	2245000	There are a few songs that did not make the cut, um,
2245000	2248000	due to licensing issues or whatever, but only a few.
2248000	2251000	Paranoid, uh, by Black Sabbath, although it was a cover
2251000	2254000	to begin with, Run to the Hills by Iron Maiden,
2254000	2257000	and Enter Sandman by Metallica will not be making its way
2257000	2260000	to Rock Band 2. It is probably, uh,
2260000	2263000	theorized, uh, Metallica is the next Guitar Hero solo game,
2263000	2266000	um, so that's probably why they're going with that camp.
2266000	2269000	A lot of people are surprised that the Aerosmith song is actually
2269000	2272000	going over into Rock Band 2, but it was brought up by some good
2272000	2275000	commenters on some of the blogs I was reading that the, uh,
2275000	2278000	Train Keep on Runnin', that song that they have in Rock Band 1,
2278000	2281000	was not originally written by them, therefore that's probably
2281000	2284000	why they don't have so much of a say as to, uh, that game,
2284000	2287000	or that song, uh, going into Rock Band 2 or not.
2287000	2290000	So, uh, very cool. What you can do, it is in the
2290000	2293000	options menu of Rock Band 1, you can actually export.
2293000	2296000	You'll get taken to a menu that will charge you the $5 fee,
2296000	2299000	and, uh, you can export the 55 tracks, takes about 10 minutes to do,
2299000	2302000	uh, and about 1.5 gigs on your hard drive,
2302000	2304000	because you are riving those songs off the disc and turning them into,
2304000	2307000	basically, download content is essentially what you're doing.
2307000	2309000	But just think about it, I mean, if you do that,
2309000	2312000	when you put in Rock Band 2 on day 1,
2312000	2314000	you're gonna have all those songs Dark Soccer just read,
2314000	2318000	and these 55 new ones, and anything you've downloaded from before.
2318000	2321000	So, that's, that's gonna be a heck of a song list,
2321000	2324000	even though, you know, a lot of them have already played, but,
2324000	2327000	that's neat. I'm looking forward to that.
2327000	2329000	Uh, it is a bummer that they have to recharge you for that,
2329000	2332000	but I guess that's a licensing thing and there's just no way around it.
2332000	2336000	And, admittedly, $5, not too bad.
2336000	2338000	Not too bad.
2338000	2341000	So, I gotta do that quickly before Rock Band 2 comes out,
2341000	2344000	because you know there's gonna be tons of people that are ripping the songs,
2344000	2346000	and then, uh, sell the game back.
2346000	2348000	I hope the game doesn't pull a gotcha,
2348000	2351000	and, like, at some point you have to insert the original Rock Band disc,
2351000	2353000	or else we'll be screwed.
2353000	2356000	Well, how about some Guitar Hero World Tour news?
2356000	2359000	And this makes me happy, because I'm a fangirl.
2359000	2366000	Um, the, the, uh, latest who's gonna be in the game as a playable character is Sting.
2366000	2371000	That makes me very, very happy, because I, like, I was a big police fan.
2371000	2376000	Um, they're also, um, supposed to, uh, be, uh,
2376000	2380000	recreating, uh, Jimi Hendrix, Ozzy Osbourne, Zach Wilde, and Billy Corgan.
2380000	2382000	So that's pretty cool.
2382000	2386000	Um, but, it's gonna, you just have to find out, I guess,
2386000	2389000	if anyone else is gonna be in Guitar Hero World Tour when it comes out, so.
2391000	2395000	That's kinda neat that there's, uh, the different, uh, famous folks in Guitar Hero,
2395000	2397000	but, you know, not surprising either, because you had, uh,
2397000	2401000	what, the guy from Poison, Bret Michaels, and Slash, and Tom Morello, so.
2401000	2404000	I guess, uh, Guitar Hero likes to go for the celebrities.
2404000	2406000	You know what I want?
2406000	2408000	Guitar Hero Gorilla's Edition.
2408000	2409000	Good luck.
2409000	2412000	That could, that would be fantastic.
2412000	2415000	I'm surprised, none of their songs have shown up in any games, though.
2415000	2416000	Any of these band games, anyway.
2416000	2418000	Have we had any blur?
2418000	2421000	I don't believe so. I could be wrong.
2421000	2422000	I don't believe so.
2422000	2423000	We've had Radiohead.
2423000	2425000	I'm sure Chat will correct us if we're wrong.
2425000	2428000	Yeah, but I would love to see Gorilla's Edition.
2428000	2431000	Yeah, you know what's pretty rad is that, um,
2431000	2434000	in Rock Band 1, when you're playing online,
2434000	2437000	uh, you get a random song that you play against your opponent with,
2437000	2441000	which I wish Guitar Hero did, so that way everybody didn't pick Through the Fire and the Flames.
2441000	2444000	But in Rock Band, you get a random song when you're playing Score Attack or whatever.
2444000	2448000	Um, and if you have download songs in common,
2448000	2451000	the random song might just be pulled from your download pool.
2451000	2455000	So I've actually played, um, Perfect Drug against someone online.
2455000	2456000	That's a download song.
2456000	2459000	And today I did My Iron Lung by Radiohead, because that was a download song.
2459000	2461000	And I thought that was pretty rad that that came up.
2461000	2462000	And Radiohead's awesome anyway.
2462000	2465000	And, yeah, and that way you know that the person you're playing with is cool,
2465000	2467000	because they spent the money to download that song.
2467000	2469000	So they must like Radiohead, too.
2469000	2470000	So, pretty cool.
2470000	2474000	Uh, Quiltipo would like to point out, Beatlebum is in Rock Band.
2474000	2475000	Ah.
2475000	2476000	I thought there was one.
2476000	2480000	Yeah, but there's better Blur songs than Beatlebum.
2480000	2481000	Yeah.
2481000	2483000	Give Me Coffee and TV.
2483000	2484000	I like that song.
2484000	2485000	Honestly, if I was gonna-
2485000	2486000	Girls and Boys, hello.
2486000	2487000	No, no, no.
2487000	2488000	Love that song.
2488000	2491000	For just the guitar in it, because I'm sorry, even though he had to be an ass.
2491000	2497000	Graham Coxon is one of the, I would have to say, best guitar players out there.
2497000	2500000	And I would love to have had Charmless Man in there,
2500000	2503000	because the guitar in that would be really fun.
2503000	2506000	Bobby's in chat saying, I want to play Rock Band with Rob,
2506000	2508000	and I also want to play Civ Rev with Rob.
2508000	2509000	Bring it!
2509000	2512000	I haven't played Civ Rev in a while.
2512000	2514000	There's been all these new games coming out,
2514000	2516000	but I still love me some Civilization, don't get me wrong.
2516000	2519000	Um, well, you know, we've been gushing about Guitar Hero
2519000	2521000	and Rock Band and all these guitar games all night,
2521000	2525000	and one person not so much gushing about Guitar Hero right now,
2525000	2529000	Matthew Sweet, and this actually is a little bit older news.
2529000	2533000	It came up last week, but Penny Arcade Expo was kind of distracting us.
2533000	2539000	Matthew Sweet is actually considering that he's gonna be doing a lawsuit against Guitar Hero 2.
2539000	2542000	He says, quote, I've been trying to see if I can get a lawsuit against them
2542000	2544000	because they never asked to use the song.
2544000	2549000	A lot of kids have gotten into his music because of the inclusion of the song in the game.
2549000	2553000	Quote, I found out that the Romantics have a lawsuit going against the makers of that game
2553000	2555000	because of the song, What I Like About You.
2555000	2558000	He says, I don't know if the Romantics are gonna win their suit, but it's really weird.
2558000	2562000	I've never sued anyone in my life, and I don't think it would amount to much anyway.
2562000	2563000	Hmm.
2563000	2567000	So he's thinking about actually, even though he kind of admits more people get into the music,
2567000	2572000	he wants to sue the people that did Guitar Hero for putting his song in there.
2572000	2575000	Although it was probably his record label that signed it away.
2575000	2576000	Doesn't make sense.
2576000	2577000	Probably.
2577000	2581000	And honestly though, because I was actually, I don't know if you remember,
2581000	2584000	I was really surprised to see Matthew Sweet's songs in there
2584000	2589000	because I've actually been a fan of Matthew Sweet since I was in high school.
2589000	2594000	Ever since, no I take that back, ever since college because he did a couple of videos.
2594000	2598000	One of them for a girlfriend that had clips from Cobra in it.
2598000	2601000	He's a big anime fan, that's how I found out.
2601000	2606000	And also one with lots of Urasayatsura clips in the video.
2606000	2608000	I've been waiting, that was the other one.
2608000	2614000	And on top of that, I picked up quite a number of his albums because I have,
2614000	2619000	my favorite album that he did is Altered Beast, and he did one called Son of Altered Beast,
2619000	2621000	that has some of my favorite songs there.
2621000	2629000	So to hear that he's wanting to sue a video game company for promoting his music,
2629000	2632000	because I thought that me and five other people liked him,
2632000	2635000	that's just sort of ridiculous I think.
2635000	2639000	Yeah, you can be a fan of someone and still admit, smack, what are you thinking?
2639000	2642000	If one of my favorite musicians was doing this, I would say,
2642000	2645000	I like you, but what are you thinking, dude?
2645000	2648000	And yes, it was Space Adventure Cobra.
2648000	2654000	It was a lot of clips from the super uber long movie version.
2654000	2657000	Frisbee says sue someone, it's the American way.
2657000	2660000	But here's the weird thing, Matthew Sweet references the romantics thing,
2660000	2663000	but that was actually thrown out of court, the whole romantics thing.
2663000	2665000	It got laughed out of court essentially.
2665000	2668000	If Matthew Sweet is listening to our show, which I don't think he is,
2668000	2676000	but if he is, don't sue, because it would be stupid and I'll lose a lot of respect for you.
2676000	2677000	Seriously?
2677000	2681000	And Keltipo, the Girlfriend album was very good.
2681000	2686000	You suing Guitar Hero will go over about as well as when Metallica sued Napster.
2686000	2691000	But I mean, you can actually kind of understand why Metallica sued Napster,
2691000	2694000	but in this case, you know, why so upset?
2694000	2696000	You know, it gets more people into your music and so on.
2696000	2699000	Is he just upset he's not getting more money out of the whole thing?
2699000	2700000	Or what is that?
2700000	2703000	I mean, if you sell CDs because of it, what's the big fucking deal?
2703000	2707000	Well, now we've spun a whole Takahashi anime thing in chat
2707000	2711000	because I happen to mention Ura Sayatsura.
2711000	2716000	And also, I think that Fire Tripper is a little better than some of those
2716000	2719000	if you have to go for individual stuff, the end.
2719000	2721000	By the way, that interview is from the North County Times.
2721000	2724000	If you want to check that out for yourself, nctimes.com.
2724000	2728000	Did the interview on August 21st, which was when we weren't here.
2728000	2732000	Hopefully he snaps out of it and doesn't end up suing the game
2732000	2733000	because I think that would be a little silly
2733000	2735000	and is just going to get a more negative publicity
2735000	2737000	amongst the people playing this game than positive.
2737000	2740000	I think if he has issues with it, he needs to take it up with his record company
2740000	2743000	or whoever signed on the dotted line and licensed his song away.
2743000	2745000	That is the person he needs to be going after
2745000	2748000	if he doesn't want this to happen in the future, in my opinion.
2748000	2751000	Well, your opinion counts because you are an internet celebrity.
2751000	2752000	Mm-hmm.
2752000	2753000	Well, how would...
2753000	2754000	Okay.
2754000	2755000	What?
2755000	2757000	I don't know if I'd say that, but okay, I'll take it.
2757000	2760000	Oh, come on, the internet is serious business.
2760000	2764000	Anyway, for something that, you know,
2764000	2769000	there is quite a bit of classic rock fans still left in the world.
2769000	2771000	You know, I'm one, definitely.
2771000	2775000	But there are some classic acts that are going to be re-recording
2775000	2778000	some master tracks for Guitar Hero World Tour.
2778000	2782000	Some of these are actually in...
2782000	2787000	I'd have to say MC5's Kick Out the Jams is going to be one.
2787000	2792000	They're actually having some help from Alice in Chains member
2792000	2795000	Jerry Cantrell and Guns N' Roses' Gilby Clark.
2795000	2799000	Sex Pistols is putting up pretty vacant.
2799000	2803000	And Motorhead re-recorded Overkill.
2803000	2806000	I like Motorhead, by the way.
2806000	2808000	So I think that that's pretty neat.
2808000	2813000	There also, though, was apparently a little bit of trouble, though,
2813000	2815000	with some of the tracks they're wanting to put in,
2815000	2820000	so they're all working on trying to get the bugs ironed out.
2820000	2821000	Hmm.
2821000	2822000	Could be interesting.
2822000	2823000	I think so.
2823000	2824000	We'll see what happens with that.
2824000	2826000	Now, you know, we've been talking a lot about music games,
2826000	2828000	but let's not forget the music game that started it all,
2828000	2830000	at least for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2830000	2832000	Dance Dance Revolution is still trucking along,
2832000	2837000	and Hottest Party 2 and DDRX have gotten some more song announcements this week
2837000	2839000	about some of the songs that you're going to find in the game.
2839000	2843000	Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2, it's completely made up of covers,
2843000	2847000	but actually now there's also going to be some Konami originals in the game,
2847000	2849000	and those were some of the songs they announced this week.
2849000	2853000	For example, we have Desert Journey by DJ Taka.
2853000	2855000	A new song is going to show up in the game.
2855000	2860000	Tera Kyouka's Suigetsu Row is coming out.
2860000	2864000	And if you want to look at the full list yourself, ddronlinecommunity.com
2864000	2868000	if you want to see some of the other songs that are going to be in the game.
2868000	2873000	I do want to also mention the songs that are coming to DDRX on the PlayStation 2.
2873000	2875000	Some new licensed songs.
2875000	2876000	I thought this was interesting.
2876000	2878000	Naropa is coming back, and the reason why that's interesting
2878000	2880000	is because they're one of the different drum artists.
2880000	2883000	So now you have the different drum songs going on to PlayStation 2.
2883000	2887000	Feel is the song by Naropa that you're going to see in DDRX.
2887000	2891000	Some more new edits of old classic DDR songs.
2891000	2896000	Remember Butterfly and Dubby Dub were getting recut and re-edited for DDRX.
2896000	2897000	I don't know if you heard about that.
2897000	2899000	Some other songs got announced.
2899000	2902000	Hero is coming. Remember?
2902000	2904000	La da dee da da.
2904000	2907000	You are my hero.
2907000	2908000	But no, get this.
2908000	2911000	Get Up and Move is also getting a new edit.
2911000	2915000	Remember SNK? Get up and move.
2915000	2917000	That wasn't a good song.
2917000	2919000	I didn't like it either, but some people do.
2919000	2921000	I was talking to Shane online.
2921000	2925000	He was all excited about that song, but he likes a lot of crap.
2925000	2928000	Well, you know, we can't say anything about Mr. High School Musical, so...
2928000	2930000	Well, here you go. Here's something cool for you.
2930000	2932000	How about Pet Shop Boys? Always on my mind.
2932000	2933000	Sweet!
2933000	2934000	There you go. Something for Jamie.
2934000	2935000	So there you go.
2935000	2940000	Open from the Dub Pistols synthesized for the punk label Fat Rec Chords.
2940000	2943000	The artist The Epixies was synthesized.
2943000	2945000	So it looks like a variety of music.
2945000	2949000	You have synth pop, punk, and bad music.
2949000	2950000	All different genres.
2950000	2951000	I'm just kidding.
2951000	2953000	Something for everyone.
2953000	2955000	The bottom of the barrel of the Konami originals.
2955000	2956000	Yeah, exactly.
2956000	2958000	Trying to see if there's comments from chat.
2958000	2960000	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com
2960000	2963000	Some people are yelling out, get up and move.
2963000	2967000	Frisbees remembering there was a sweet freestyle to it.
2967000	2970000	I bet there was some pretty awesome freestyle to that song, though, actually.
2970000	2975000	I've seen, you know, awesome freestyle done to really crappy songs, so...
2975000	2979000	Frisbee also says that they need to do the R21 patch for DDRX Arcade.
2979000	2981000	You know, I'm not thinking that's actually going to happen.
2981000	2984000	Needs more Too Unlimited.
2984000	2986000	How about no?
2986000	2989000	Too Unlimited is like the quintessential Jock Jams band.
2989000	2991000	I guess.
2991000	2993000	We're in the Twilight Zone.
2993000	2994000	Alright, forget it.
2994000	2996000	That song nearly broke my ankle.
2996000	2998000	Let's talk about release dates!
2998000	3000000	Some games that are coming out this week.
3000000	3001000	Loki's not here tonight, but fear not.
3001000	3003000	I've got the US release dates.
3003000	3006000	Of course, today, Spore was the game that came out this week,
3006000	3008000	along with Spore Creatures on the DS,
3008000	3010000	which played a demo for that at PAX,
3010000	3013000	and you can safely stay away from that one.
3013000	3016000	A lot of folks are very excited about NHL 2009.
3016000	3018000	It's making its way out this week as well on a variety of systems.
3018000	3021000	Also coming out, Lock's Quest on the DS.
3021000	3022000	Viva Pinata, Pocket Paradise.
3022000	3025000	That's the whole really weird thing.
3025000	3028000	You're seeing an Xbox franchise on a DS platform.
3028000	3031000	Worlds Collide this week on the DS.
3031000	3033000	That comes out September 8th.
3033000	3035000	Also coming out on the DS, The Price is Right,
3035000	3037000	the game from none other than Ubisoft.
3037000	3039000	That makes you happy, doesn't it?
3039000	3040000	But it's not Bob Barker, is it?
3040000	3042000	Yeah, I don't know.
3042000	3044000	Some things just don't need to be made into games,
3044000	3045000	and I think that's one of them.
3045000	3047000	They need to do classic Price is Right for you.
3047000	3048000	Also that does not need to be made into games,
3048000	3050000	Hell's Kitchen is coming out on the Wii,
3050000	3053000	along with the Price is Right port on the Wii.
3053000	3055000	And Hell's Kitchen also made its way to the DS.
3055000	3058000	Shows just how easy games can go back and forth between the DS and the Wii.
3058000	3061000	If you're more of a PC gamer, guess what?
3061000	3064000	You get Romance of the Three Kingdoms Part 11.
3064000	3066000	Comes out this week on PC.
3066000	3070000	One would think that romance by now would be stale and dead.
3070000	3073000	Dead beyond Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.
3073000	3074000	Divorce of the Three Kingdoms.
3074000	3076000	I know it means romance in the classical sense.
3076000	3080000	No, there are just rabid, rabid fans of that series.
3080000	3084000	And, you know, I think all the way back to when that series was on the NES.
3084000	3087000	Dude, I spent a lot of nights playing Nobunaga's Ambition.
3087000	3088000	Remember, those games were awesome.
3088000	3089000	They really were.
3089000	3092000	I think it's neat that they've lived on through all this time.
3092000	3097000	Maze is a Fate DS, a new role-playing game coming out for the DS this week as well.
3097000	3102000	And Dragon Ball Z Trilogy, because you just can never have enough Dragon Ball.
3102000	3103000	It's coming out on PlayStation 2.
3103000	3109000	Hey, and if you want some packaged games, CSI Super Pac on the PC.
3109000	3110000	Little known fact.
3110000	3114000	Well, maybe this is a little known fact, but sometimes overlooked fact.
3114000	3119000	The CSI games are designed by the same folks who are very popular for their recent Strong Bad game.
3119000	3121000	So, something to think about.
3121000	3125000	If you're going to laugh off a CSI game, it might not be as bad as you think.
3125000	3126000	The more you know.
3126000	3131000	Oh, I did play the Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People.
3131000	3132000	Now, what did you think?
3132000	3133000	It was pretty cool.
3133000	3139000	Especially with the seven-track player, it said that it was short-lived because the faulty part of it was the on-switch.
3139000	3140000	Uh-huh.
3140000	3141000	There was none.
3141000	3148000	I got to read some comments here from chat because they're making fun of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms thing.
3148000	3149000	TheRobD says,
3149000	3150000	It needs to be like Madden.
3150000	3153000	Romance of the Three Kingdoms 09 with a new roster.
3153000	3158000	And GameGuru reminds us there has to be a marriage of the Three Kingdoms first for there to be a divorce.
3158000	3159000	Because right now it's just Romance.
3159000	3160000	That would have been part four.
3160000	3172000	It's using Romance in an all-encompassing way because right now they're on the ongoing legal battle for custody of the Pet Chihuahua.
3172000	3176000	And Quel-Tippo makes the mandatory joke, in-joke here.
3176000	3179000	How long can Lu-Bay and Cow-Cow go at it?
3179000	3182000	That's what Quel-Tippo wants to know.
3182000	3184000	Oh, baby.
3184000	3187000	I know a game he's been playing.
3187000	3188000	All right, forget it.
3188000	3190000	Hump, hump, hump.
3190000	3192000	So how about other news?
3192000	3193000	How about it?
3193000	3194000	More stuff!
3194000	3197000	And it's all coming out on the 12th.
3197000	3198000	At least in Europe.
3198000	3210000	We have GTR Evolution on PC, Baha on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and PS2, and R-Type Command on PSP.
3210000	3213000	And that's it.
3213000	3214000	Slow week?
3214000	3218000	Drive-thru, do not pass go, do not collect $200.
3218000	3219000	Dang, fries are done.
3219000	3222000	You lose, good day, sir.
3222000	3227000	Over to Japan and the release dates over there are coming out on September 11th because their release dates are not the same as over here.
3227000	3228000	I believe they're on a Friday.
3228000	3230000	I have that day off of work, too.
3230000	3232000	Congrats, I guess.
3232000	3233000	Are they recognizing it?
3233000	3234000	Oh, no, it's a Thursday, I'm sorry.
3234000	3236000	Are they recognizing it as a holiday now?
3236000	3239000	No, I asked off that day so I could go to San Francisco and go to art galleries.
3239000	3240000	Oh, gotcha.
3240000	3242000	You know, that's actually Loki's birthday.
3242000	3243000	I know.
3243000	3244000	That might be part of the reason he's not here.
3244000	3251000	He might be at a little thing for his day job, but I think secretly he might be wanting to spend some birthday time with the wife because his birthday is actually September 11th.
3251000	3253000	You never forget when his birthday is.
3253000	3257000	Well, my birthday was the Waco thing.
3257000	3259000	So what tragedy happens on yours?
3259000	3261000	Actually, I did not get tragedy.
3261000	3263000	I had some good things happen on my birthday.
3263000	3268000	One, sodomy laws were abolished in Texas on my birthday.
3268000	3270000	You know, my birthday was also the day before Hitler's birthday.
3270000	3278000	And I'd like to also point out Strom Thurman died on my birthday.
3278000	3279000	Just saying, yo.
3279000	3280000	You asked what happened on my birthday.
3280000	3281000	There it is.
3281000	3284000	Draw whatever conclusions you want.
3284000	3289000	By the way, Strom Thurman also died the same day those sodomy laws were repealed.
3289000	3290000	Just food for thought.
3290000	3291000	What?
3291000	3292000	What?
3292000	3293000	I like pie.
3293000	3294000	Do you?
3294000	3295000	Rob.
3295000	3296000	What?
3296000	3297000	Rob.
3297000	3298000	Rob.
3298000	3299000	Rob.
3299000	3300000	Rob.
3300000	3301000	Rob.
3301000	3302000	Rob.
3302000	3303000	Rob.
3303000	3304000	Rob.
3304000	3305000	Rob.
3305000	3306000	Rob.
3306000	3307000	Rob.
3307000	3308000	Rob.
3308000	3309000	Rob.
3309000	3310000	Rob.
3310000	3311000	Guess what?
3311000	3312000	What?
3312000	3313000	All right, look.
3313000	3314000	Let's move to Japan in the release dates over there on Thursday, September 11th.
3314000	3315000	Viva pinata.
3315000	3316000	You know that just here is Viva pinata part two.
3316000	3317000	What's his subtitle for that?
3317000	3318000	I forgot.
3318000	3319000	It's Viva pinata two?
3319000	3320000	Something in paradise?
3320000	3321000	Yeah.
3321000	3322000	Change AWS?
3322000	3323200	There's a lot of people who are actually really into that game over here.
3323200	3324720	Punching people in the face in paradise?
3324720	3327960	I've actually seen a lot of really positive reviews on it.
3327960	3328960	Death to pinatas.
3328960	3330960	I don't think you can kill the pinatas yet.
3330960	3331960	Pinata burning death.
3331960	3335960	Although I am waiting for the minigame where you finally take a baseball bat to your damn pinatas.
3336960	3337960	Have we had that happen yet?
3337960	3343960	And find that their guts are made out of, you know, Tootsie Pops and Jolly Ranchers.
3345960	3352960	The Rob D in chat says, I leave you to envision Skye celebrated the abolishing of sodomy laws with Strom Thurman on his birthday yourself.
3352960	3355960	Let's just leave it to the imagination, folks.
3355960	3356960	Why do you have to go there?
3356960	3360960	Double Clutch comes out on the Xbox 360 in Japan, speaking of double entendres.
3360960	3362960	Infinite Undiscovery.
3362960	3363960	Game Grumps.
3363960	3364960	Wow.
3364960	3366960	Viva Pinata 2 electric boogaloo.
3366960	3369960	These are all ways that you could celebrate the repeal of sodomy laws.
3369960	3371960	Double Clutch and Infinite Undiscovery.
3371960	3374960	There you go, coming out on the Xbox 360.
3376960	3380960	Also a brand new 360 console in 60 gigabyte flavor.
3380960	3384960	Coming out in Japan on the 11th on the Playstation 3.
3384960	3391960	Double Clutch and Stranglehold makes its way as well to the Playstation 3 on September 11th.
3391960	3393960	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
3393960	3400960	One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1, Nami ni Yoryu Hiyohu is coming out.
3400960	3403960	That's a Namco game, actually, coming out.
3403960	3407960	I have no idea what it is or if it's something that they're releasing here, but there you go.
3407960	3410960	Coming out on the handheld systems, let's take a look.
3410960	3413960	Or, sorry, first let's revisit the Playstation 2 because, you know, it's still selling over there.
3413960	3417960	Sega Ages 2500, are you listening, Jamie?
3417960	3424960	Volume 33, Fantasy Zone Complete Collection on the Playstation 2.
3424960	3427960	Do you know how much this would cost you to import?
3427960	3431960	Less than $30, if you want to pick that up on the Playstation 2.
3431960	3432960	I know.
3432960	3437960	Well, you know, I've picked up a lot of the, um, I've actually got the Fantasy Zone remake that they did.
3437960	3443960	Because I got, we got like the first three Sega Ages games that came out, the 2900 ones.
3443960	3445960	2500, whatever.
3445960	3449960	DJ Dark Knight, I don't think the game is Viva Pinata 2 Mercenaries.
3449960	3450960	I think that's something else.
3450960	3454960	Dark Tetsuya says, I think Sega heard that E all the way in Japan.
3454960	3457960	And GS68 says, Jamie just fangasm.
3457960	3459960	Can we get a mop in the studio, please?
3459960	3465960	Hey! I actually held the microphone away from my face so that I didn't break anybody's eardrums.
3465960	3469960	So, you all owe me money now for saving you a medical expense.
3469960	3471960	Alright, and you know I love Princess Soft.
3471960	3476960	And Princess Soft is releasing a game called Sashu Shiken Kujira Alive.
3476960	3480960	Sweet, so sweet, is coming out from Princess Soft on the Playstation 2.
3480960	3483960	Now we can visit the handhelds real quick and then we'll get back to some of the gaming news.
3483960	3485960	I like the handhelds, don't you?
3485960	3489960	Spore, shut up, Spore Creatures is coming out on the DS as well.
3489960	3491960	It's just like, gosh, a bunch of other games.
3491960	3500960	Gaken Mu Henshubu Kansu Choju Jinsu Research File comes out on the Nintendo DS as well.
3500960	3502960	As well as some DS Vision games.
3502960	3508960	And a game called, what is this, Hoshizora no Comic Garden.
3508960	3510960	I wonder if that's an anime.
3510960	3514960	Because it has a limited edition, usually limited edition games are games based on animes.
3514960	3517960	And on the PSP this week, nothing.
3517960	3519960	No games for you this week.
3519960	3520960	Your mom, the game.
3520960	3522960	Nothing for you on PSP, sorry to say.
3522960	3523960	Thank you, pull forward.
3523960	3527960	I'm adding that, by the way, to the list of official Orange Noms Radio wanted games.
3527960	3528960	Your mom, the game?
3528960	3529960	Your mom, the game.
3529960	3530960	What would you do in your mom, the game?
3530960	3531960	Well, you'd do...
3534960	3535960	Zing!
3537960	3538960	Nice, nice.
3540960	3542960	Alright, that's it for Japanese release dates.
3542960	3543960	You caught me in a very weird mood.
3543960	3544960	Apparently.
3545960	3546960	How about more news?
3546960	3547960	How about it?
3547960	3550960	Because No Gnus is Good Gnus with Gary Gnu.
3550960	3553960	And if none of you get that, then you're too young.
3553960	3554960	And I feel old now.
3554960	3556960	Eurogamer Expo!
3558960	3564960	Eurogamer is actually a very big, very popular site overseas.
3564960	3568960	And they carry lots of good news and have Eurogamer TV.
3568960	3571960	And I actually go to that site quite often.
3571960	3574960	But Eurogamer Network is having Eurogamer Expo.
3574960	3577960	And I've said Eurogamer a whole bunch of times in a row.
3577960	3582960	But it's at the Old Truman Brewery, October 28th through 29th in London.
3582960	3585960	And there will be some more details up there.
3585960	3590960	But it will be two sessions each day, 11am to 4pm and 5pm to 10pm.
3590960	3602960	Also going to be playable there, Street Fighter IV, Prince of Persia, Mirror's Edge, Little Big Planet, Tomb Raider Underworld, Far Cry 2, Fallout 3, Saints Row 2, and many more!
3602960	3604960	In other words, all the shit we already played at PAX.
3604960	3605960	Hey!
3605960	3606960	Just kidding.
3606960	3607960	No, I think this is a great idea.
3607960	3611960	Actually, we didn't get Rob, but we didn't get Street Fighter IV.
3611960	3612960	Alright, alright.
3612960	3615960	And I don't believe I saw any Prince of Persia.
3615960	3617960	I'm just messing.
3617960	3619960	Gotta get your feathers all ruffled.
3619960	3622960	We did get Velvet Assassin and that girl needed to eat too.
3622960	3638960	So, at any rate, I would actually very much love for any of our European listeners, if you're going, write us up, review, take photos, get back, get some internet celebrity for yourself through our site.
3638960	3643960	Which hopefully we'll have our new site done by the time Eurogamer Expo happens.
3643960	3645960	I personally will be at a steampunk convention.
3645960	3652960	What made you, uh, what do you think provoked the idea of a Eurogamer Expo?
3652960	3656960	Well, don't really all they have is Leipzig over in Europe.
3656960	3658960	This just seems kind of, like, sudden, you know what I mean?
3658960	3659960	It just came out of nowhere.
3659960	3661960	I think it sounds fun, especially if it's at a brewery.
3661960	3664960	Don't get me wrong, it sounds fun and all, but it just seems very sudden.
3664960	3667960	Beer and video games, how can you go wrong?
3667960	3669960	Alright, fair enough.
3669960	3670960	They know how to party.
3670960	3674960	By the way, we had some great drinks in Seattle.
3674960	3677960	We went to, I like Tap House, but it was too hot.
3677960	3679960	Yeah, Tap House was cool, and what was the other one, Von's?
3679960	3680960	Von's.
3680960	3683960	Oh, yeah, I like the supermarket chain here, but it's a bar up in Seattle.
3683960	3687960	They had, um, taps, um, from, like, different breweries all over the wall,
3687960	3691960	and they had in big bold letters on, uh, their banner outside,
3691960	3697960	We Do Not Serve Bud, and I was like, this place is already fantastic.
3697960	3703960	And then they had, um, really, really good food, and I tried some very interesting beer.
3703960	3707960	That was one of my favorite places, but we did not have, I gotta say, Seattle folks,
3707960	3710960	we did not have a single bit of bad food up in Seattle.
3710960	3711960	I really didn't.
3711960	3712960	We did eat.
3712960	3713960	Y'all know how to eat.
3713960	3717960	We did eat some fairly, a couple places we went to were a bit more upscale
3717960	3719960	than I think we were anticipating, but.
3719960	3721960	Still, I've eaten some shitty food here locally.
3721960	3724960	Look, I've eaten off the menu at Cheesecake Factory, which you know I don't,
3724960	3726960	I don't enjoy their lunch at all.
3726960	3727960	They have good breakfast, though.
3727960	3730960	I don't, I don't, I don't think, you don't go to Cheesecake Factory for the food,
3730960	3733960	or for cheesecake, but I had some great food in Seattle, which ironically,
3733960	3735960	there was a lot of people going to Cheesecake Factory in Seattle,
3735960	3736960	but I was kind of like, what's the point?
3736960	3738960	We went to Sago World Grill, and that was cute.
3738960	3739960	Sago World Grill was great.
3739960	3742960	Best burger I've ever had in a really good pizza.
3742960	3743960	So anyway.
3743960	3744960	Good times.
3744960	3745960	Anyway, sorry.
3745960	3746960	And foodio!
3746960	3747960	Mm, orange lunch foodio.
3747960	3751960	Uh, well, you know, we could eat some foodio and play Halo 3.
3751960	3756960	Halo 3 Mythic was apparently spotted by some folks at Penny Arcade Expo.
3756960	3760960	Halo 3 Mythic showed up just before the Penny Arcade Expo official kickoff.
3760960	3763960	I wonder if one of the press folks actually snuck a picture of that,
3763960	3764960	what was going on.
3764960	3768960	But apparently, Halo 3 Mythic is something that was kind of poking through,
3768960	3771960	maybe something that shouldn't be announced yet,
3771960	3772960	that's going to be coming out soon.
3772960	3776960	Apparently, Halo 3 Mythic only has a multiplayer-only menu,
3776960	3779960	and it's version 1.2.
3779960	3780960	Kind of interesting.
3780960	3783960	What's also interesting about it is that possibly there are some new achievements
3783960	3784960	coming from this as well.
3784960	3787960	And who knows, it could be Photoshopped or whatever,
3787960	3790960	but apparently, if this Halo 3 Mythic thing is true,
3790960	3792960	there's 30 new achievements coming with it.
3792960	3796960	That's 750 gamer points for achievements such as
3796960	3800960	Came From Behind, Flag Dropped, Defend This, Double Double,
3800960	3802960	and Vidmaster Challenge Annual,
3802960	3806960	which has no gamer score but is an achievement nonetheless.
3806960	3808960	If you want to see the full list of those,
3808960	3811960	they are available on some various blogs out there.
3811960	3816960	They went originally on the Ascendant Justic forum.
3816960	3819960	So check that out.
3819960	3821960	You Halo 3 fans.
3821960	3826960	Well, other things to check out that would definitely enable some Halo 3 action.
3826960	3829960	The Xbox 360 price cut is official, actually,
3829960	3831960	as of the 5th of this month.
3831960	3837960	They've dropped the price of the 60 gigabyte to $2.99,
3837960	3841960	and the Xbox 360 Arcade to $1.99,
3841960	3846960	and the 360 Elite to $3.99.
3846960	3851960	Basically, I guess it's just going to pave the way for more sales,
3851960	3853960	and I hope that they're not...
3853960	3855960	I would think that they've gotten past where they were working
3855960	3858960	at a loss on their consoles, don't you think?
3858960	3860960	They might still be taking a little loss,
3860960	3862960	but I think for them to be price point under the Wii,
3862960	3864960	it might just be worth it.
3864960	3867960	Seriously, and to be perfectly honest,
3867960	3869960	and this is, again, my opinion,
3869960	3872960	and the system is only as good as the games that are on it,
3872960	3874960	as I've said many times,
3874960	3878960	but I think that the Xbox 360 right now has the better library,
3878960	3881960	and I think them dropping the price of the systems
3881960	3884960	while keeping the titles where they are now
3884960	3888960	is a very smart move and should definitely turn in a profit for them.
3888960	3890960	I think that's a very good idea,
3890960	3892960	because honestly, the games are great.
3892960	3896960	There's been very few things that I haven't really enjoyed playing on Xbox 360.
3896960	3901960	Who doesn't like cheap? Who? No one.
3901960	3903960	The people that bought Yaris.
3903960	3908960	Zing. Maybe that, but really, that's it.
3908960	3911960	Who doesn't like cheap?
3911960	3917960	I really like Cheap Cheap's cooking show on Parappa.
3917960	3920960	So we'll see if the price cuts move more systems,
3920960	3924960	because a lot of folks are forecasting that it's going to move big amounts of systems,
3924960	3926960	because there's going to be people to go in trying to get Wiis,
3926960	3928960	and folks aren't going to be able to get it,
3928960	3930960	so they're going to get an Xbox 360.
3930960	3931960	We'll see.
3931960	3933960	Katamari's Forever in chat says,
3933960	3937960	Oh no, now the Wii will have lower sales than the 360.
3937960	3940960	Really, though, if you want Wii, you'll get Wii no matter what.
3940960	3942960	Scalper, anyone?
3942960	3943960	There you go.
3943960	3945960	Misty says, I still say Poopy on Arcade.
3945960	3948960	Not enough storage space for my planned Rock Band downloads.
3948960	3950960	So it's a very good point.
3950960	3952960	Even though the system might be cheaper than the Wii,
3952960	3955960	it's not the greatest Xbox 360 system,
3955960	3959960	and I think there's going to be a lot of people out there that are going to find this out the hard way.
3959960	3963960	And then they have to fork over that extra $100 anyway a little later on for the hard drive.
3963960	3967960	That's going to be tough.
3967960	3970960	We've got one more story for you guys before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.
3970960	3971960	I can't stress this enough.
3971960	3973960	This is rumor and rumor only,
3973960	3978960	but apparently it's very interesting that this rumor is timed as soon after Penny Arcade Expo as it is,
3978960	3987960	and that rumor is that right now E3, the board behind E3, is in talks to make E3 public.
3987960	3988960	Why not?
3988960	3990960	It's worked so well for Penny Arcade Expo.
3990960	3992960	They are talking about making it public.
3992960	3998960	Apparently the idea has officially been brought forward to the Entertainment Software Association,
3998960	4004960	and that could mean as soon as next year the show could be public.
4004960	4006960	Now that could also be a bunch of wishful thinking,
4006960	4011960	but we have heard a lot of developers and organizers talking pretty openly about the E3 sucks now.
4011960	4013960	A lot of them were the same ones who said,
4013960	4017960	It sucked before. We want it to be private.
4017960	4024960	But what's also interesting to note is that with that you have a lot of people praising Penny Arcade Expo,
4024960	4028960	and I've got to say this compared to something we didn't talk about earlier in the show,
4028960	4034960	and I know PAX is an E3, and we've heard tons and tons of comparisons,
4034960	4039960	and that PAX is what everybody thought E3 was going to be when they heard about E3,
4039960	4043960	and PAX is just all this stuff.
4043960	4048960	But just asking directly, comparing the two shows since we've been fortunate to go to both
4048960	4052960	and talking about old E3 and PAX, at least I know what I noticed.
4052960	4055960	One thing I noticed, people were way more laid back at PAX.
4055960	4060960	It was great. I thought it was fantastic.
4060960	4066960	Keep in mind, you've got so many people in such an area.
4066960	4071960	Even as big as E3 was, there's going to be tensions running.
4071960	4075960	You've got a lot of professionals that have to get from appointment to appointment to appointment.
4075960	4079960	We had to do that, especially our last year at E3.
4079960	4082960	How many appointments did we set up trying to get interviews and visiting?
4082960	4086960	Exactly.
4086960	4090960	Because we didn't have to schedule interviews, the developers, those who made it,
4090960	4094960	were just there chatting about everything and being so open about the games
4094960	4097960	and letting everyone take pictures and not having all this crap,
4097960	4100960	especially people with a bug up their butt and not letting you take pictures,
4100960	4103960	which they did this year here at PAX. They were great about it.
4103960	4107960	But it was just so completely laid back. Everyone was friendly.
4107960	4110960	Even the enforcers. I'd say they were all fantastic.
4110960	4113960	They did a great job, and they were friendly.
4113960	4115960	They were very personable, the ones I dealt with.
4115960	4119960	Pardon my French, but everybody had to stick up their fucking ass at E3.
4119960	4122960	That's always been my problem with E3 is that people are very snobby.
4122960	4125960	I don't know if that's the LA thing or what it is,
4125960	4128960	but I don't like getting treated like shit at a video game expo.
4128960	4131960	You've heard the stories I've told on this show about some of these big media gatherings
4131960	4134960	that we've been to in the past and how we're looked down on.
4134960	4137960	They're like, oh, my independent podcast. They don't have millions of listeners.
4137960	4142960	I just threw something. I'm so angry.
4142960	4146960	A lot of people have sticks at their ass. Not to say everybody is like that at E3.
4146960	4151960	There's some very cool people at E3, but at PAX, everybody was awesome.
4151960	4154960	Developers are out there on the floor mingling with people.
4154960	4158960	Loki played some game, and I watched the people come up to him and say,
4158960	4160960	oh, so did you like it? Loki was like, yeah.
4160960	4162960	He was trying to be nice and give a positive answer.
4162960	4166960	They actually said, what did you like about it? What was cool about it to you?
4166960	4168960	I like that they were asking for feedback.
4168960	4171960	That guy from Guitar Hero, and I apologize, I forgot his name.
4171960	4173960	He didn't have a business card to give me.
4173960	4177960	He talked to us for quite some time after the interview he did on All Games Radio.
4177960	4178960	He was very cool.
4178960	4182960	He did confirm for me that there is no bonus peripheral for studio mode.
4182960	4183960	There you go.
4183960	4184960	You heard it first.
4184960	4185960	There you go.
4185960	4188960	It was very cool. People were just hanging out.
4188960	4191960	The guy from Warhammer Online was hilarious when we had him on the show.
4191960	4193960	Then I saw him later on the show floor.
4193960	4195960	He was just hanging out, chilling, showing off the game.
4195960	4198960	People are so much more laid back at PAX.
4198960	4201960	I ran into my DM again, and he waved at me.
4201960	4207960	If they put it on the floor at PAX, they realize the pictures are going to be all over the internet.
4207960	4211960	People have finally gotten over it, and they don't try to control it so much at PAX
4211960	4213960	because they realize it's a gamer thing.
4213960	4217960	So if E3 is going to take that step, that's a big step for E3.
4217960	4221960	A lot of people are going to have to change their attitudes. Cap'n!
4223960	4224960	Just saying.
4224960	4230960	You know, I still didn't have quite the problem that you guys had at E3.
4230960	4237960	But I think that a lot of it has to do with...
4237960	4239960	I'm just saying, Luke, who didn't go to PAX?
4239960	4240960	Yeah.
4241960	4243960	Some people can't handle it, I guess.
4243960	4245960	Because PAX is too coo.
4245960	4251960	Anyhow, we actually asked this question on our pre-OLR Twit on our Twitter.
4251960	4254960	Twitter.com slash OLR at us on Twitter.
4254960	4256960	There's been quite a few people to have this week, so thank you guys very much for that.
4256960	4260960	And we hope you enjoyed the updates from Jamie's iPhone at Penny Arcade Expo.
4260960	4262960	I was in charge of the...
4262960	4266960	And sometimes the pictures didn't attach with the text I included.
4266960	4267960	So, oops.
4267960	4268960	Oh, how funny.
4268960	4272960	But awesome technology, because we had the All Games listeners, and as it was going on,
4272960	4275960	I think you actually took, because we weren't able to do live video, just due to bandwidth,
4275960	4279960	but you would actually take, I think when the guy was there with this Game Boy playing the song,
4279960	4282960	you took a picture of it, put it on Twitter, and within a minute,
4282960	4285960	it made its way into the All Games chat room so people could see it.
4285960	4288960	So it wasn't video, but it was definitely instant media, which was great.
4288960	4291960	I was just thinking that if people were actually keeping up with the Twitter,
4291960	4297960	I wanted them to see who we were talking to while we were live, so that's what my thought was.
4297960	4300960	Some comments from the Twitter to people that responded to our question.
4300960	4303960	We asked, hey, there is a rumor that E3 is going public.
4303960	4305960	Is this a good idea or a bad idea?
4305960	4307960	DJ Rama S says, good idea.
4307960	4309960	I mean, a lot of other Expos are public, so why not?
4309960	4312960	As long as you pay for a pass and follow the rules, fair game.
4312960	4314960	Quiltipo says, capital idea.
4314960	4316960	I've always wanted to meet D-list celebrities.
4316960	4319960	Because remember, E3 went under because of Paris Hilton and stuff.
4319960	4321960	But even PAX had their D-list celebrities.
4321960	4325960	I mean, you know, if you consider Jonathan Colton, Wil Wheaton, Freezepop, you know.
4325960	4327960	But we had cool people there.
4327960	4328960	That's true.
4328960	4330960	People that actually cater to the nerd crowds.
4330960	4332960	We had people there who worked for their fame.
4332960	4335960	To be fair, E3 did have Adam West.
4335960	4337960	To be fair.
4337960	4340960	Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
4340960	4341960	Anyway.
4341960	4345960	Also, I want to point out, Misty OLR responded and said, public?
4345960	4348960	You mean it wasn't public enough with all the loopholes that got exploited?
4348960	4350960	She says, bad idea, I think.
4350960	4353960	Especially with your report of the last E3 you went to.
4353960	4358960	Act Def says, considering the success of Penny Arcade Expo, I think they want to emulate that to redeem themselves.
4358960	4360960	I do hope they get it right, though.
4360960	4363960	I apologize if I managed to announce this name.
4363960	4367960	Giovedea? G-I-O-V-E-D-A? Giove?
4367960	4369960	Oh, my bad.
4369960	4374960	It says, bad idea for the whole time, but good idea to open it public for a day.
4374960	4376960	It's an industry expo, not a convention.
4376960	4381960	And you know, that's something I've heard a lot, is make it more like Tokyo Game Show, where it's closed for one day, but open for the rest.
4381960	4384960	And I think that would be fair. I think a good conclusion.
4384960	4389960	And DROfWarC, I think that might be Doctor of Warcraft or something like that?
4389960	4393960	I don't know. DROfWarC says, screw E3 going public.
4393960	4395960	PAX is the new thing in town.
4395960	4398960	But really, it wouldn't hurt to have the two West Coast shows.
4398960	4400960	Forget E for No One.
4400960	4402960	Hey, wait a minute. I'm going to E for No One. Come on.
4402960	4405960	It might actually be kind of cool. You never know what might happen.
4405960	4412960	So, again, if you want to get the pre-OLR Twits and respond to a story before the show goes live, check us out on Twitter.
4412960	4414960	Our username? O-L-R.
4414960	4416960	Really hard to remember, I know.
4416960	4417960	Really difficult.
4417960	4421960	Alright, we are about to go to, Rama says, you butcher Japanese and Italian.
4421960	4427960	Yes, I do. Look, foreign language was my one weakness in high school, if it's not completely obvious here on this show.
4427960	4428960	Okay?
4428960	4429960	So, there you go.
4429960	4438960	Como te llama. Alright, let's go to a much better segment than me horribly mispronouncing names here on the show.
4438960	4442960	And talk about the classic video game of the week.
4442960	4448960	Every week, Dark Sakura goes into the archives and pulls out a classic video game she thinks you all should be playing.
4448960	4452960	And I got to tell you, this week, she went far into the archives this week.
4452960	4456960	So, Dark Sakura, what should all the kids be playing this week?
4456960	4463960	The game of the week is actually quite the obscure little title called Puzzle and Dessu.
4463960	4476960	Which, also, if you happen to find the name actually written in Japanese text, the first part of it's in katakana and the last part's in hiragana and the second part's in katakana, which is very weird.
4476960	4483960	But anyway, it's a little puzzle game where you're this guy with a pointy hat who looks like a naked gnome.
4483960	4485960	And the game plays...
4485960	4488960	That's the Travelocity Gnome with no pants.
4488960	4495960	The game itself plays sort of like a combination of Pengo, Columns, and Bomberman.
4495960	4507960	And the publisher on this game, for those who actually keep up with putting that on the wiki, is Nichibutsu Nihon Busan.
4507960	4516960	It was actually released on April 14th, 1995, and I almost bought a copy at PAX, but I didn't.
4516960	4524960	But anyway, the way that it works is that you've got these four different colored blocks, and you have to make all of them touch.
4524960	4535960	However, if three of them touch, then they vanish, and you may actually lose the entire puzzle and the time limit that you're given, because you haven't made all the blocks vanish.
4535960	4546960	And actually, because it is that weird and obscure, I'm going to be linking one of the images into the chatroom so that they can see what it's like.
4546960	4549960	And honestly, if you can...
4549960	4552960	People are playing emulators, just freaking download it already.
4552960	4554960	It's a really fun little game.
4554960	4563960	But keep in mind, as you get further and further into the game, it actually comes up a bit more like Super Silkeban, if anyone's played that.
4563960	4568960	And you have such a massive challenge on trying to get your blocks touching.
4568960	4571960	Basically, you have to shove them in position.
4571960	4576960	But, as you go further, you'll get some with percentage marks on them that are immobile.
4576960	4581960	You get ice blocks that will dissipate when they touch another object.
4581960	4589960	You have arrow blocks, which you can only push in the direction that they're pointing.
4589960	4600960	You've also got a block, because you can actually play multiplayer, you can block other people from making different moves.
4600960	4605960	And then you've got teleport blocks that you can move them around.
4605960	4610960	So it's just a very, very interesting little game.
4610960	4613960	It gets very, very challenging.
4613960	4617960	And it's definitely one if you like a game that makes you think a little bit.
4617960	4623960	But it is only, you cannot play against the computer, it's only against people.
4623960	4626960	Or you can do single-player mode, which is just you.
4626960	4631960	It's really just a fun little game, really it is.
4631960	4633960	That's all I can say about it.
4633960	4642960	Really obscure to the US market, but I think there's been another game similar to this release in the US, but for the life of me, I can't rumble with this.
4642960	4645960	So...
4645960	4649960	I know, I want to say I've played a game like this too, and I don't know what the hell it is.
4649960	4653960	But it drove me nuts, it's hard. This is a hard game.
4653960	4656960	But I will put the name of it in the chatroom, so they can look it up.
4656960	4660960	Or you can actually look at the same YouTube I'm looking at here, Puzzle Endesu.
4660960	4662960	D-E-S-U. Very easy to spell.
4662960	4664960	Yeah, I just blogged the name in.
4664960	4668960	And we'll link the, if you want to, since you've got it up, if you'll link that in the chatroom.
4668960	4669960	Sure.
4669960	4670960	But it's really fun.
4670960	4675960	And remember, if you want to see these links as they show up, you've got to listen live to us on Sunday nights.
4675960	4678960	Chat.OrangeLauncherDude.com to join our chatroom.
4678960	4682960	And AllGames.com is where we're broadcasting every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific time.
4682960	4686960	There it is, your classic game of the week, Puzzle Endesu.
4686960	4689960	Very simple game that will drive you nuts.
4689960	4695960	No calls during part A. I guess people don't like the whole, or they're just not used to it, the whole calls during the show thing.
4695960	4698960	So we'll just have to open it up at the end of B like usual.
4698960	4700960	So much for that experiment.
4700960	4701960	Well, you try new things.
4701960	4702960	Call us!
4702960	4703960	Nah, I already shut it off for now.
4703960	4705960	No, Colton, come back on part B.
4705960	4710960	No, we're already in hour 20 for part A, so we've got to take a break, so we can get to part B.
4710960	4711960	All right, we'll get on part B.
4711960	4713960	Don't worry, we'll have time for calls in part B.
4713960	4716960	It's just folks are used to the end of the show.
4716960	4717960	So we'll do that.
4717960	4718960	We're going to take a quick break.
4718960	4721960	We'll be back, though, with more of OrangeLauncher Radio right after a quick break.
4721960	4731960	We'll see you then.
4731960	4737960	Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here from OrangeLauncher Radio with an important message.
4737960	4743960	Every year, thousands of yellow wizards are about to die from a horrible outbreak, food shooting.
4743960	4748960	Shooting food causes the loss of life in many red warriors and green elves across the planet.
4748960	4754960	Elf needs food badly, so please think twice before shooting food this holiday season.
4754960	4762960	The Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault.
4762960	4771960	Remember, don't shoot food.
4771960	4772960	She's calm.
4772960	4775960	There are a couple of other things I just tell you and I remember.
4775960	4776960	He's crazy.
4776960	4782960	If you could not see the similarities and the personalities within, like, the first couple of episodes, you need brain surgery.
4782960	4783960	I mean, seriously.
4783960	4787960	Can two people get together and record a podcast without driving each other crazy?
4787960	4788960	Slap.
4788960	4790960	Oh, you don't have to hurt me so hard.
4790960	4791960	It wasn't that hard.
4791960	4796960	Find out on Anime Jam Sessions with your hosts, DJ Ron Ma S and Kuro Usagi.
4796960	4803960	Log on to djronmas.net slash anime jam or look up Anime Jam Sessions on iTunes.
4803960	4809960	Hi, I'm G-Steel, and I just want to say that you are all losers for listening to video games called music.
4809960	4812960	Music from video games is just a bunch of beeps and blips.
4812960	4819960	I don't understand how people say music from, say, Final Fantasies, Frees of Rage, or maximum genius music.
4819960	4822960	It's from video games and therefore talent-less garbage.
4822960	4826960	Music that Shiro and Ugo Uematsu can partake of by genitalia.
4826960	4830960	Video games locked in good health from making people out of electronic beef.
4830960	4834960	Don't listen to real music because music that has no tolerance needs to be banned.
4834960	4835960	Can't think's fine.
4835960	4840960	P.S. This PSA is brought to you by La Molana, home of the never-ending hell-tempo music.
4841960	4842960	Gaming Radio.
4842960	4848960	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
4848960	4850960	Uh, mooch, uh, moo-kaw-key.
4850960	4852960	Orange Lounge Radio.
4852960	4854960	Tax cuts.
4854960	4859960	Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 7th, 2008.
4859960	4863960	For our 293rd episode, if you can believe it.
4863960	4868960	There was a little boo-boo in the numbering of the podcast last week, and some folks think they got episode 291 twice.
4868960	4871960	But no, it was just misnumbering, an error on my part.
4871960	4872960	Shoot me.
4872960	4876960	Remember, don't shoot Rob. Rob is not food.
4876960	4878960	Uh, not with us tonight, of course.
4878960	4880960	Techmaster Loki is out for the night, but that's okay.
4880960	4883960	It's Dark Soccer and myself, feeling the love.
4883960	4885960	But just platonically, thank you.
4885960	4886960	She's married, I'm gay.
4886960	4889960	Alright, you guys are filling in as the co-hosts tonight.
4889960	4893960	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you have some things you want to say.
4893960	4898960	Um, some folks commenting on the various commercials there that were being played during the break.
4898960	4899960	Having to recycle a little bit.
4899960	4905960	If you have some promos that you want to have played during our free break, send them on in to us.
4905960	4907960	Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, you can send me an email.
4907960	4909960	So, alright.
4909960	4916960	Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some gaming news this week with some news on the PSP.
4916960	4921960	Sony PSP and PlayStation 3 spend a little time in Sony Land right now.
4921960	4929960	And this is kind of interesting is that they are now going to be launching a Wi-Fi store on the actual PSP.
4929960	4934960	The PlayStation Store is actually coming to the PSP and you can do that.
4934960	4938960	That will be happening this fall in Japan, but probably it's going to inevitably happen over here as well.
4938960	4941960	I mean, if there's money to be made, why not?
4941960	4945960	Sony, by the way, is also going to be launching a new infrastructure mode.
4945960	4950960	This is something that happens when you connect the PlayStation, or the PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3.
4950960	4952960	And you can do this all wirelessly.
4952960	4959960	And then what happens is that you can actually do some type of like multiplayer modes through a PlayStation 3 connection for some games.
4959960	4965960	So you kind of use your PlayStation 3 as like a hub to kind of do wireless stuff between the PSP.
4965960	4968960	Which is kind of interesting.
4968960	4974960	Could be interesting to see what they do with that, but certainly there's been a lot of love between the PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation 3.
4974960	4977960	So it's very neat to see those two work together.
4977960	4984960	In a way, it seems like Nintendo is just catching up in that regard with the whole DS demos finally making their way to the Wii just a couple months ago.
4984960	4986960	We've been waiting.
4986960	4988960	Huh, nice.
4988960	4996960	Well, I'll tell you other things though that we've been waiting for, at least people who are fangirls like me or fanboys not like me because I'm a girl.
4996960	5006960	Of course, we all knew that Kingdom Hearts was going to be a PlayStation 3 exclusive and there's going to be something about that at Tokyo Game Show.
5006960	5012960	Well, really though, it's a rumor.
5012960	5017960	But, you know, we won't know unless we hear something official from Tokyo Game Show.
5017960	5023960	But honestly though, given that Kingdom Hearts has already been pretty much strictly...
5023960	5026960	Well, except for the DS version, which doesn't count.
5026960	5037960	But seeing that Squeenix has been sticking with Sony for this franchise for the most part, I wouldn't be surprised if it's going to be a PS3 exclusive.
5037960	5040960	So, we'll see.
5040960	5047960	All right. By the way, I just want to point out Loki, he's not here tonight in studio, but he joined our chat room just a minute ago. I guess he's back from San Francisco.
5047960	5051960	He just said, I was tired from the San Francisco trip, so he's entertaining our folks in chat room.
5051960	5059960	And he's rubbing it in their faces that apparently everybody just at his work got a vacation to their choice of ten destinations.
5059960	5063960	It was a little prize they all won tonight and he's rubbing that in everyone's face.
5063960	5067960	So if you want to slap Loki, you can do that in our chat room tonight.
5067960	5069960	chat.orangesolentrated.com if you are listening live.
5069960	5073960	Remember, it's the slash slap command, or you can right click.
5073960	5078960	And I was actually, I was asking Loki, where are you taking me? But he's mumbling this stuff about having to take the wife.
5078960	5083960	What's up with that?
5083960	5088960	I go places without Dan. He's not too happy about it, but I do.
5088960	5092960	All right. All right. Back to video games and the real world and so on.
5092960	5095960	No, that's cool. Hope he has fun wherever he goes.
5095960	5098960	But he better not miss another Sunday or he's so fired. No, I'm kidding.
5098960	5102960	All right. Yeah. I'm special and get to miss Sundays, huh?
5102960	5106960	No, no, no. He did an awesome job with the PSP or our PSP site.
5106960	5110960	So there you have it. And I'm actually I'm going to be gone in a couple of weeks for you for all.
5110960	5113960	So lots of radio hosts taking the week off. All right.
5113960	5118960	Anyhow, PlayStation Network games also going to be simul launched in the UMD form.
5118960	5124960	I think this is kind of interesting. Apparently, this is actually going to be happening in Europe with a couple of games that are coming out.
5124960	5130960	Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is actually going to be releasing collections of PlayStation Network titles that are going to be on UMD.
5130960	5135960	There's the power pack, which is going to have the games flow siphon filter, combat ops and beats.
5135960	5139960	And the puzzle pack will include Lemmings, go puzzle and go Sudoku.
5139960	5144960	So for those of you that didn't feel like getting the games on the PlayStation three or you've still been too cheap to get a PlayStation three.
5144960	5149960	Now you can get these on UMD for the PlayStation portable, which I think is kind of interesting there.
5149960	5155960	It's kind of interesting that there is still that cohesiveness between PlayStation three and PSP.
5155960	5161960	I think that's kind of interesting that the titles are so I know we joke a lot about the DS and the Wii getting a lot of the same ports.
5161960	5167960	But I mean, for real, you're seeing like the exact same games, exact same thing going between the PSP and the PlayStation three.
5167960	5171960	It's kind of interesting. So you'll be able to check that out in Europe.
5171960	5176960	Honestly, I imagine if it sells well over there, it's probably only a matter of time before that stuff comes out over here.
5176960	5181960	I mean, where there's money to be made. Right. We'll see.
5181960	5184960	Oh, that's pretty much the way that it works, isn't it?
5184960	5188960	Well, at any rate, we do have some other news.
5188960	5197960	We also have some information about a little big planet supposed to be having a limited public beta this month.
5197960	5200960	And I think that's pretty cool.
5200960	5205960	There's no other details about it, but they said there you'll be able to sign up for it.
5205960	5210960	It just doesn't say how or when or well, but it will be made public right before the test is to be launched.
5210960	5214960	They also do have an invite only method.
5214960	5218960	So they said they'll be large enough that people around the world will be able to have fun with it.
5218960	5222960	So like a Gmail thing, remember when Gmail invites were very rare or wait, no, no, no.
5222960	5225960	Live journal. Remember when like you got one invite code for live journal?
5225960	5228960	Yeah. Remember that? Unless you paid. Yeah.
5228960	5231960	And then you could pay and get a bunch more, but you could invite one person to live journal.
5231960	5235960	It sounds like it might be like that where you get to invite one person.
5235960	5237960	Could be interesting. Who knows? It could be.
5237960	5242960	Somebody send me an invite, please.
5242960	5245960	If I get a PlayStation 3, then I'll want one of those invites, too. We'll see.
5245960	5248960	We could all pass along the invites to each other if that's how it works.
5248960	5251960	Although I somehow bet there'll be some controls on that somehow.
5251960	5254960	I don't think they'll give it to just anyone. Maybe.
5254960	5256960	We'll see.
5256960	5261960	One game that's been brought up earlier, and it's a popular PSP game, and somebody was talking about this in chat earlier.
5261960	5266960	DJ Max. Have you ever played this game? It's pretty much BeatMania 2DX, but with your PSP.
5266960	5268960	And it's Korean, which is interesting.
5268960	5273960	Miklotov, you know, old buddy of the show, he loves this game, and he's brought it over a couple times.
5273960	5276960	There's some very funny videos on there, and the game's kind of interesting.
5276960	5280960	And so obviously a lot of our music game fans love this series, DJ Max.
5280960	5284960	Well, guess what? More DJ Max games coming out.
5284960	5288960	Pentavision has announced they are coming out with two new titles.
5288960	5293960	Pardon me for horribly mispronouncing these names, but there's Clasequel Edition and Black Square.
5293960	5295960	I know I got that one right.
5295960	5299960	Pentavision is actually going after both the hardcore and the casual gamers.
5299960	5303960	It's not really said if these two splits are for that purpose.
5303960	5306960	Maybe one is easier than the other. Who knows?
5306960	5311960	Who knows if one's got more casual mode and another one is for the more hardcore player.
5311960	5314960	But you know if you're a DJ Max fan, you're getting them both anyway.
5314960	5316960	So what's the matter?
5316960	5319960	There's going to be folks that import both no matter what happens.
5319960	5321960	Well, there you go.
5321960	5326960	Some folks have noticed that there is a lot more mainstream music in the Clasequel Edition.
5326960	5330960	So maybe there's more like, you know, the MTV of Korea.
5330960	5333960	Those type of artists are in this, you know, CE.
5333960	5337960	And then Black Square maybe has more of the originals. Who knows?
5337960	5338960	Maybe.
5338960	5343960	Some folks in comment or some folks in chatroom are definitely feeling pretty hardcore about this.
5343960	5346960	Gsquared68 is a fan of the game and says, wait, what?
5346960	5348960	Oh, they're probably just limited editions.
5348960	5351960	They need a feature that tracks percentage and not just score.
5351960	5355960	Scoring system equals combo based equals epic fail.
5355960	5358960	But Act Def says, yay, DJ Max.
5358960	5360960	So there you go.
5360960	5366960	Well, on other PlayStation news, and this should make some of our European listeners happy,
5366960	5371960	is that there will be randomly selected PS3 owners in Europe
5371960	5375960	who will be able to get the demo of Motorstorm Pacific Rift,
5375960	5381960	which was only exclusive to the US for people who bought copies of Core on PSN.
5381960	5391960	For any of the players in Europe who also, I do believe, purchased the game,
5391960	5397960	it will be available, and it's supposed to include the Air Zone track.
5397960	5401960	So you can give it a try, and it has support for single player and two player split screen.
5401960	5403960	So it'd be cool.
5403960	5408960	And actually, it's supposed to be free for a few days before the official release.
5408960	5410960	Motorstorm 2 is very pretty, what I saw.
5410960	5413960	It was a very popular demo, so I didn't get to get my hands on it,
5413960	5415960	but it looked very pretty from what I noticed.
5415960	5419960	Sorry, I like the jungle scape much more than the dirt of the first one.
5419960	5420960	Yeah.
5420960	5422960	I think the jungle was a much better setting for the game,
5422960	5425960	although I would like to see, I don't know, if it's too much to ask for a game with a little more diversity.
5425960	5427960	Give us some jungle and some dirt.
5427960	5428960	Those are the great racing games.
5428960	5430960	Even Excite Truck did that.
5430960	5431960	Dirt.
5431960	5432960	Exactly.
5432960	5444960	Well, guess what game you get to experience all over again.
5444960	5445960	That's right.
5445960	5446960	All over again.
5446960	5453960	And if the PC wasn't enough, and the PSP wasn't enough, and the Xbox 360 wasn't enough,
5453960	5456960	you get to get shining and luminous.
5456960	5458960	And your mobile phones weren't enough.
5458960	5462960	You get to do this all over again on the PlayStation Network.
5462960	5463960	That's right.
5463960	5466960	Luminous Supernova was announced on the PlayStation Network this week,
5466960	5469960	and it is the same game you know and love.
5469960	5474960	But with some new stuff, you know there's going to be some new skins, some new songs, and some new modes.
5474960	5476960	They've announced Dig Down Mode.
5476960	5481960	You use the falling blocks to erase squares from the play field that already has blocks on it.
5481960	5486960	So it's basically clearing a crap play field, kind of like Tetris had a mode like that, where the well was already full.
5486960	5487960	Mr. Driller!
5487960	5488960	No.
5488960	5490960	Well, a little different, because that's the whole game of Mr. Driller.
5490960	5493960	Sequencer mode, though, sounds kind of neat.
5493960	5497960	You can actually make your own background music using the sound loops that are in the sound bank.
5497960	5502960	Drums, bass, synthesizer one, synthesizer two, and effects, 20 different loops.
5502960	5504960	So you get to kind of make your own songs using the sequencer.
5504960	5508960	But then again, I think this sounds exactly like, I don't know if you've ever played the Spice World video game,
5508960	5510960	where you can make your own Spice Girls song.
5510960	5512960	Pretty much the same thing.
5512960	5514960	I mean, really, when you break it down, it was just...
5514960	5516960	Spice World was a crabby game!
5516960	5518960	No, it was awesomely bad.
5518960	5520960	It was like the showgirls of video games.
5520960	5522960	It was so bad, it was actually kind of good.
5522960	5524960	So there you have it.
5524960	5528960	Supernova, 40 unlockable skins in challenge mode.
5528960	5531960	Also, of course, skin edit, time attack, puzzle mission modes.
5531960	5533960	Two-player versus mode.
5533960	5539960	No release date set yet, and it's not known if it's going to take the microtransaction approach
5539960	5541960	that made this game so controversial on the Xbox 360,
5541960	5544960	where you only buy the base game and then have to buy everything separate.
5544960	5546960	My gut tells me no.
5546960	5549960	That they're not gonna, because it didn't go over well on the 360,
5549960	5554960	they'll just charge one big price for the whole thing on the PlayStation Network.
5554960	5556960	But we'll see. Time will tell.
5556960	5559960	I do like the skin that they released on one of the screenshots here.
5559960	5563960	It looks like a little 8-bit, I don't know, I'd call it like an Earthbound kind of graphic.
5563960	5566960	The guy looks like a character from Earthbound, kind of like running through a background
5566960	5569960	of an arcade-looking thing, so that already looks cool.
5569960	5573960	It's not NES. It's Earthbound-like.
5573960	5576960	I don't know, I only say that because it's a little kid wearing a baseball cap, so it reminds me of that.
5576960	5578960	But there you have it.
5578960	5581960	So, yeah, it's going to be coming out on PlayStation Network.
5581960	5586960	I'm kind of not interested because whatever they put in this game will be recycled into Luminous 3,
5586960	5588960	which I'm sure is inevitable.
5588960	5591960	Or they'll release us yet another microtransition for Xbox Live Arcade, I bet.
5591960	5594960	And honestly, the Well mode doesn't sound that interesting.
5594960	5596960	Sequencer mode sounds okay.
5596960	5599960	I'd like it better if you could use your own songs.
5599960	5602960	Maybe. Someday. Maybe. Who knows.
5602960	5604960	All right, well every week here on Orange Lounge Radio
5604960	5608960	we allow you guys to interact with us, not just through the chat room and the phone calls,
5608960	5611960	but your emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5611960	5614960	And every week DarkSakura digs into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite emails
5614960	5617960	and reads them for you live here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5617960	5620960	I'm sure the email's been collecting as we were away at PAX.
5620960	5621960	Kind of.
5621960	5623960	So let's get to it. I don't know if she has time to read them all,
5623960	5625960	but she'll at least do some of her favorites tonight.
5625960	5627960	Well, I can read most of them.
5627960	5633960	Um, hey O.L.R., ever since 2006 I was very excited for the Wii since it came out.
5633960	5637960	I purchased one early 2007. I had to work to pay it off all summer.
5637960	5642960	I bought all the big Nintendo titles and played each of them for about 20 hours until I got stuck.
5642960	5645960	Then I got an Xbox 360. They're incomparable.
5645960	5649960	The Xbox 360 has good online experience and great high-definition graphics.
5649960	5653960	After watching Nintendo's press conference, I have completely lost hope.
5653960	5656960	Obviously Nintendo doesn't need to do anything for us.
5656960	5660960	Long story short, my Wii is ending today on eBay,
5660960	5664960	and I'm hoping to get a lot from it seeing as how it still is in demand.
5664960	5670960	Anyway, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.
5670960	5671960	Love your show. Keep it up.
5671960	5674960	By the way, my name is Dan, and my gamer tag is DanTheThird.
5674960	5678960	Okay, you have a good name.
5678960	5681960	That's up to you. I'm not getting rid of my Wii.
5681960	5684960	I still have stuff on that that I like to play.
5684960	5687960	Stuff on 360 I like to play.
5687960	5690960	It just really depends on what type of things that you like.
5690960	5694960	I mean, there's stuff on PS3 that I like to play.
5694960	5698960	You know, it's been a little while since we've reiterated the golden rule of gaming for our listeners,
5698960	5701960	so why don't we remind the listeners of what the golden rule of gaming is?
5701960	5705960	The Wii system is only as good as the games that are on it.
5705960	5709960	So in other words, if there's a game that looks to be coming out in the Wii's future that you want to play,
5709960	5712960	keep in mind that the Wii is the only place you're going to be able to play it, probably.
5712960	5715960	Granted, there are some games that get ported everywhere, like Rock Band,
5715960	5718960	but a lot of times on the Wii, that's the only place you can play it.
5718960	5721960	So if it's going to have the game you want, you've got to hang on to that Wii.
5721960	5724960	As much as I've been kind of knocking the game a little bit,
5724960	5726960	thinking it could be stale like the other ones,
5726960	5729960	I have high hopes for Animal Crossing,
5729960	5733960	because I want to try it out, because it might actually be pretty cool with the internet-in-the-room-speak thing.
5733960	5735960	We'll see. Time will tell.
5735960	5738960	But I wouldn't know if I sold my Wii back in a panic,
5738960	5741960	and they might be even harder to get when you want them again,
5741960	5745960	or you might think you make a profit off it now, but it's a risky game.
5745960	5747960	It's a risky game to play.
5747960	5750960	But at the same time, if you're not enjoying your Wii and you're never playing your Wii
5750960	5753960	and you don't think there's anything in the future, then sell it.
5753960	5757960	Some other family probably really wants it. Why not make some money off it?
5757960	5759960	But realize, I've seen people do this.
5759960	5763960	I've even seen a good friend of mine do this, where he'll get a system, sell it back,
5763960	5766960	buy the same system six months later, sell it back, buy it again.
5766960	5769960	And I'm just kind of like, what are you thinking? You're losing so much money doing that.
5769960	5774960	If you think something's going to come out on it that you want to play in the future, hang on to it.
5774960	5777960	You'll save money in the long run.
5777960	5780960	Next you up, and this is regarding Evangelion, actually.
5780960	5783960	Hi, I have a friend that is obsessed with Evangelion,
5783960	5785960	and I was wondering if there were any good games from that series.
5785960	5789960	The answer is no, unless you like playing the dating sim kind,
5789960	5793960	and then I've got, there was, you know, the Saturn ones that came out.
5793960	5797960	I think there was one on Nintendo 64, and there most recently came out one,
5797960	5802960	I want to say on PS2, was it?
5802960	5803960	I don't seek out these games.
5803960	5806960	They're still making Eva games, so just look online.
5806960	5808960	The Pachinko game's the best one. Go for that.
5808960	5812960	Anyway, he says he is learning Japanese, so importing is not a problem.
5812960	5817960	Okay. If it has that crazy intro theme from the anime, it gets bonus points.
5817960	5818960	Sure, they all do.
5818960	5819960	They all do.
5819960	5825960	In fact, I can tell you from experience that at least one of the Saturn ones has a full opening,
5825960	5826960	like it was an episode.
5826960	5830960	It's set up like an episode, basically.
5830960	5834960	I would make him ask for himself, but I'm still working on converting him to OLR goodness.
5834960	5836960	You guys and Gal are great.
5836960	5840960	Your funny kicks my brain, and I enjoy it every week via podcast.
5840960	5843960	Someday I will listen live. That is not a threat. It's a promise.
5843960	5846960	PS, Dark Sakura, why do you hate Ayanami?
5846960	5852960	Because she's boring and has the personality of a bed sheet, and Asuka could kick her ass.
5852960	5854960	I have no idea what you're talking about, but it's funny.
5854960	5857960	She's a clone girl with no personality.
5857960	5862960	PPS, I hope I avoided the grammar attack. That was scary.
5862960	5867960	Well...
5867960	5872960	Let me distract the grammar Nazi, Dark Sakura, with some chat comments.
5872960	5876960	The last email generated a lot of chat comments talking about the kids wanting to sell back his Wii.
5876960	5881960	Skylark in chat says, fuck my Wii.
5881960	5883960	I haven't played it in four months. Can't sell it, though.
5883960	5887960	Spent $300 on Virtual Console.
5887960	5890960	Then again, I've probably sold quite a bit, or I've probably bought a lot on that, too.
5890960	5893960	Skylark also continues to say, only good for a party environment.
5893960	5899960	TheRobD says, some other family wants it. Think of the children. Sell your Wii.
5899960	5902960	Is anyone thinking of the children?
5902960	5905960	ActDeaf would like to point out that bed sheets are warm and sometimes comfy.
5905960	5908960	That's only when worn by other bodies.
5908960	5913960	Okay, she has the personality of a...
5913960	5914960	Of a gnat.
5914960	5917960	No, of a stalactite.
5917960	5919960	Because she's kind of a drip.
5919960	5920960	Alright, move on.
5920960	5922960	How's that?
5922960	5925960	Okay, moving forward.
5925960	5928960	There's actually a little bit more. He signed it.
5928960	5934960	By Zanovore, yes I eat aliens, munch munch crunch crunch slurp gulp happy.
5934960	5937960	Thank you. At least it's not an Olive Garden reference.
5937960	5942960	TheRobD is referencing Pax, saying, I must say the Dark Sakura was cool to meet in person,
5942960	5948960	but after finding out how much she likes Gachamon and hates Rayonami,
5948960	5950960	he says, Dark Sakura plus plus.
5950960	5951960	Oh, thank you.
5951960	5953960	Next email.
5953960	5958960	I think it's time to check how the Eye of Judgment is doing in sales, don't you?
5958960	5962960	I listened to you guys to put me to sleep.
5962960	5964960	No, no, you're not that boring.
5964960	5965960	Hey, wait a minute.
5965960	5968960	Let me finish. No, you're not that boring. It's just more entertaining than music.
5968960	5971960	And I have not heard anything on the Eye of Judgment.
5971960	5973960	Is it just me or did you forget?
5973960	5978960	Sincerely is Richard, AKA the Doctor, AKA XGC the Doctor, AKA that one guy.
5978960	5984960	Okay. Look, it's not going to sell a million.
5984960	5987960	I hate to break it to you, but I will look up the numbers right now.
5987960	5989960	Well, Dark Sakura reads the next email.
5989960	5992960	Hey, OLR. Tae Ban here from Kenya.
5992960	5996960	I haven't been able to take a picture of Samara's cafe yet, but the pic is coming.
5996960	6002960	I finally bought a Nintendo DS, so I'm looking for some recommendations on some RPGs I should import for the system.
6002960	6005960	Sorry for the shortness of my email, but I'm typing this out on my iPhone.
6005960	6010960	Thanks for the read on your show. Tae Ban... I can't pronounce it right.
6010960	6012960	Yeah, how are those iPhone sales doing in Kenya?
6012960	6014960	They're all over the place.
6014960	6017960	This message is brought to you by Kenya, home of the never-ending mud walls.
6017960	6020960	P.S. this isn't my email address. I was banned from Gmail.
6020960	6025960	You can't get banned from Gmail. The guy is following me on Twitter. It's a lie.
6025960	6028960	Admit why you are lying. Why do you do this?
6028960	6030960	I just think it's funny.
6030960	6031960	I know, I know.
6031960	6033960	The world ends with you.
6033960	6040960	Eye of Judgement, 220,000.22 million. So you're just over one fifth of the way there.
6040960	6042960	Final Fantasy VI.
6042960	6046960	And then watch out for the Kenyans because they run really fast according to that one commercial.
6046960	6049960	Okay, next email.
6049960	6051960	How goes it? It goes.
6051960	6056960	So yeah, I tried to make some sense when typing, but I'm horrid with punctuation and grammar in general.
6056960	6060960	It's not something... This is the one that I sort of savaged before.
6060960	6067960	It's not something I really picked up on and was in trouble a lot as a kid when you were supposed to learn all that stuff.
6067960	6072960	Well, that being said, it's me, Glider, aka the 56k-er. Just had a few things to mention.
6072960	6078960	A little bit pissed about digital life this year. I've been going for the past few years, gonna miss it this year, but oh well.
6078960	6084960	Speaking of Jet Set Radio, one of my personal faves, another unusual skating game that was on PlayStation 2, Yaya Caballista.
6084960	6091960	Okay, City Skater. I played the crap out of it and was good very close to Jet Set Radio.
6091960	6094960	It could use a little skateboard that you put on the analog stick and held the controller sideways.
6094960	6096960	Very painful on the thumbs, but nonetheless fun.
6096960	6100960	I'm really good at reading run-in sentences, aren't I?
6100960	6105960	Dot dot dot dot dot dot dot. Oh yes, I remember what else I was going to say. Rob!
6105960	6109960	He put it all in caps, so I had to say it that way.
6109960	6118960	I heard you crack the dial-up joke. 56k-er has been my handle for almost 15 years now, so I'm not giving it up, even though I do have high-speed broadband.
6118960	6125960	20 megabytes down and 8 megabytes up. It's about avga these days. It's average these days.
6125960	6133960	But real quick, I did used to use Shotgun to 56k modems, sync them and dial out to different services with the same login.
6133960	6137960	But it's also a good way to blow out your mobile modems.
6137960	6140960	Look, at least you're not the 300-botter.
6140960	6147960	Because when I was on the Commodore 64 back in the day calling BBS's, 300-bod, yo. 300-bod.
6147960	6153960	Anyway, keep up the good work, catch you guys later. P.S. Jamie, I'm really trying to have better grammar and punctuation. Please, please don't eat me.
6153960	6161960	You know what? Just remember that when your sentence ends, use a period.
6161960	6168960	Or if you're excited, use an exclamation point. Or if you're asking a question, you use a question mark.
6168960	6172960	And then when you start your new sentence, you use the big letters.
6172960	6176960	By the way, that 300-bod modem about the size of a Neo Geo cartridge. No joke.
6176960	6177960	God, really? I know.
6177960	6179960	Next email. We have three left.
6179960	6180960	Hello, this is...
6180960	6181960	Three?
6181960	6183960	You know what?
6183960	6188960	What? Oh, it's fine. We don't have a lot of stories left, so this fills time.
6188960	6195960	This is Blade 3. I just want to say I'm a long time listener and I've never called in, but I'm going to try this weekend. Yes, please do.
6195960	6200960	Also wanted to ask your opinion about Counter Strike Source and Knights of the Old Republic. KOTOR!
6200960	6205960	If you've played them. Sorry about my bad grammar, I'm using my PSP. That's okay, yours are still better than the last email.
6205960	6210960	I also wanted to tell Loki that I'm very impressed with the PSP OLR site. It is so good.
6210960	6215960	On that note, I would like to ask his permission to use the source code for my own PSP site.
6215960	6220960	The name and images and links and stuff would be different, but I'm having trouble with formatting, so it would be handy.
6220960	6222960	Thanks, good show as always. Keep it up.
6222960	6227960	P.S. My site would be primarily used for PSP downloads such as videos, wallpapers, and demos directly to the PSP.
6227960	6231960	Well, Loki is not here to answer that question, so you'll have to ask him later.
6231960	6235960	Yeah, and he left chat. You can always email him, though. He likes getting emails. Loki at Orange House...
6235960	6236960	He loves email.
6236960	6237960	He loves email.
6237960	6238960	A lot of them.
6238960	6239960	Yeah.
6239960	6240960	Especially email about My Little Pony.
6240960	6243960	Uh-huh, and if you sign him up for Porn Mail List, he'll love that.
6243960	6245960	Oh, he loves it so much. It's so much fun.
6245960	6251960	Actually, we shouldn't be encouraging folks to do that, because our website administrator probably would frown on that, so yeah, don't actually do that.
6251960	6252960	He would send us big frowny faces.
6252960	6259960	Actually, as far as KOTOR, I'm sorry, I had a friend who used to playtest that, and I got too used to hearing her calling it Scrotor,
6259960	6266960	so I have no ideas about the name, except I've been watching UdonKru's art that they've been putting up on DeviantArt, and it looks pretty cool.
6266960	6271960	Well, when I have no opinion on the game, I mean, KOTOR's okay from what I've seen of it. What was the other one, Counter Strike?
6271960	6272960	Counter Strike Source.
6272960	6277960	Not my type of game, but Loki's. See, it's the one where Loki wasn't here, because he really plays that.
6277960	6280960	But when I don't really play the game, I turn to chat, and the Rob D says,
6280960	6286960	Source was just fun, KOTOR was revolutionary for Star Wars games, and revitalized them for a little while.
6286960	6288960	There you have it.
6288960	6295960	I just kept hearing about, this game is buggy, I hate this glitch, because my friend knew.
6295960	6301960	Hey guys, I would like to comment on a story topic you folks talked about on your last show.
6301960	6304960	I would have called in them, but your 800 number was down at the time.
6304960	6312960	In regards to the story about the We Wooked reworked Space Invaders game that was done for art slash commentary purposes,
6312960	6316960	I feel pretty much as Jamie does, I know, because I'm right all the time.
6316960	6320960	I would just like to add my own two cents in the form of two rhetorical questions.
6320960	6324960	You know how the First Amendment to our Bill of Rights guarantees us the right to free speech?
6324960	6329960	Well, what amendment guarantees the right to not be offended? Oh yeah, there isn't one.
6329960	6334960	Honestly, the whiny little fucker that was pissing and moaning about this issue really needs to get a grip.
6334960	6341960	Not only that, but if I was in the guy's shoes and the guys that did the exhibit, I probably would not have only kept the exhibit up.
6341960	6345960	I would have most likely cobbled together some of them together as a response to the whining.
6345960	6350960	I don't know, something along the lines of the player actually bringing the terrorists flying planes into twin towers,
6350960	6354960	but change the plane into a flying pair of boobs or some phallic symbol instead of a plane.
6354960	6356960	Some of y'all are just vindictive like that.
6356960	6358960	I know, it's great.
6358960	6364960	Plus add a severed head, rampant cursing, a straight couple having sex, and two men kissing.
6364960	6367960	All of this would be a roundabout way of saying fuck you to the whiners.
6367960	6370960	One more thing that relates to this that I just remembered.
6370960	6380960	The original intention of free speech in the First Amendment was to protect the voiced opinions of those who are in a minority in a given issue.
6380960	6387960	No, I don't mean like race or anything, but I mean like those people who have unpopular views like the KKK, people who think bin Laden is cool, etc.
6387960	6390960	Face it, not everyone has the same views slash opinions, etc.
6390960	6392960	Thanks for reading this. Have a good one.
6392960	6395960	Honestly, that's perfectly right.
6395960	6406960	Everybody, no matter how offensive or distasteful their opinions are, as long as they are a citizen or at least legally living within this country,
6406960	6415960	they do have a right to voice that opinion as long as they do so in an appropriate way.
6415960	6421960	You know what I mean? Like you can't, there are some places, especially private ground, where people are not going to allow some people to say things,
6421960	6428960	and that's, you know, a private organization may not let somebody from an outside source say something on their property,
6428960	6435960	but in the United States, we do have freedom of speech, even if it is unpopular and people are wrong.
6435960	6437960	Everyone's got a right to an opinion.
6437960	6441960	I had to really think for a minute what that email was even about because it's been so long.
6441960	6445960	You know, like two weeks ever since spending arcade expo.
6445960	6450960	By the way, speaking of the last email, because chat's a little bit behind,
6450960	6458960	Loki actually popped in chat to respond to the last email because he says, sorry, I'm not in chat, but I'm listening to the stream.
6458960	6462960	And he says in response to the last email, sorry, I'm not giving out the source code for the site.
6462960	6465960	But, you know, he did work really hard on it. He did earn it.
6465960	6470960	But I do want to say this. Maybe if you could get Loki that chat thing he's been looking for, that other guy won't give up.
6470960	6473960	Maybe he'll make a trade. Maybe. I'm just hypothesizing.
6473960	6476960	Loki does go on to say, I've never played Counter Strike.
6476960	6480960	And no prawn email, please. I get enough spam in my OLR email.
6480960	6483960	He's lying. He loves the porn. Just kidding.
6483960	6484960	Last email?
6484960	6487960	It's true. We all get a lot of spam in our Orange Launch Radio boxes.
6487960	6488960	That's why I deleted mine.
6488960	6489960	Jerks.
6489960	6491960	All right. Yeah. This. Last email, please.
6491960	6497960	Okay. Hey, guys. I would like to comment on a story slash topic you folks have talked about on your last show.
6497960	6498960	I would have...
6498960	6499960	No. No comment.
6499960	6500960	Duh.
6500960	6501960	I just read this one.
6501960	6502960	Did you? Oh.
6502960	6503960	Yeah.
6503960	6506960	Hey, OLR. Are you having a super special awesome Sunday?
6506960	6508960	Cookies for those who know the reference.
6508960	6514960	So, anyways, I was downloading some old podcasts from the OLR archive when you guys were away for a week.
6514960	6519960	And I can safely say that you have been a really great podcast throughout the years.
6519960	6524960	It was funny comparing your old expectations from the next gen consoles to your usual and your usual antics.
6524960	6530960	By the way, DMN Elibits is not a Katamari killer minus two... minus... oh, that's episode 200. Sorry.
6530960	6535960	To finish, I was at Blockbuster today and saw copies of DDRX and DDR Hottest Party 2 bundles.
6535960	6541960	Since the release date is September 16th for both games, can retail stores sell the games beforehand?
6541960	6542960	Not technically.
6542960	6544960	Or does it really apply to street dates?
6544960	6548960	I was mulling over this when DDR Supernova came out earlier two years ago.
6548960	6551960	Anyway, great job at PAX, and here's to another great episode.
6551960	6553960	This is from Katamari's Forever.
6553960	6557960	Sometimes, too, the bundles and the game by itself come out at different times.
6557960	6560960	That's something really important to keep in mind. That's what's going to be happening with Rock Band 2.
6560960	6566960	Rock Band 2 is coming out as a standalone game on the 360 for about a month until you start seeing the bundles hit streets.
6566960	6569960	So always keep that in mind when you see those types of things out in the wild, too.
6569960	6576960	P.S. It's my birthday at the time of reading this, September 7th, so it would really make my day if you read this, thank you.
6576960	6577960	Happy birthday!
6577960	6580960	Happy damn birthday! Cha-cha-cha.
6580960	6586960	And in closing, if a Yaris crashes in the middle of nowhere and no one hears it, does the crappy game still exist?
6586960	6587960	Sadly, yes.
6587960	6590960	You know, I'm actually thinking of getting a Yaris. I'm going to be buying a new car for Christmas.
6590960	6596960	That's going to be my Christmas present to myself, I've decided, because my previous Toyota I've had since 2001.
6596960	6599960	And it's 98, so it officially turned 10 years old this year.
6599960	6600960	It's been abused.
6600960	6605960	It's done. It's time to put a gunshot in it and lay it down for a little while.
6605960	6608960	I'm actually thinking about a Yaris. I love Toyotas.
6608960	6613960	If Rob gets one, that means if he gives us a ride somewhere, we can just say we're taking a ride in this crappy game.
6613960	6618960	Yep. Bring all the jokes on that you want. I'm really, really considering it.
6618960	6620960	Heart! Done!
6620960	6622960	Alright, no more emails.
6624960	6626960	Mailbag at OrangeLauncherDude.com if you want to get him for next week.
6626960	6630960	And yes, open the floodgates of Chatroom. Not going to be for wanting to get a Yaris.
6630960	6633960	Even if there were more emails? I'm not reading them!
6633960	6639960	You know, I could say I'm coming on here and getting any car and somebody would taunt me for my choice.
6639960	6640960	Get a Lancer.
6640960	6642960	I'm just going to have to do my own research. No.
6642960	6643960	Get a Lancer.
6643960	6644960	No.
6644960	6645960	Lancer.
6645960	6646960	No.
6646960	6647960	Lancer's the best cars ever.
6647960	6648960	Lies.
6648960	6649960	Truth.
6649960	6652960	Alright, this is going to be the best game ever.
6652960	6656960	It's on the Nintendo DS. It's from Ubisoft, so you already know this is a winner.
6656960	6659960	And Cesar Millan, do you know what he does?
6660960	6662960	He talks to dogs.
6662960	6664960	Yes, he's the dog whisperer.
6664960	6667960	See, either you knew that because you actually know it, in which case I'm going to make fun of you.
6667960	6670960	Or you knew that because you looked over here at my screen, in which case I'm going to pitch you.
6670960	6671960	Or at Red Show Roll.
6671960	6672960	Oh, okay.
6672960	6675960	Well, that's what he does. He's the dog whisperer.
6675960	6678960	You know, like the horse whisperer, but with dogs.
6678960	6681960	And yes, they're making a game out of it.
6683960	6686960	I'm leaving that pause for you to contemplate what this means for gaming.
6686960	6690960	Nintendogs it ain't, that's for sure.
6690960	6693960	It is actually a TV show on National Geographic Channel.
6693960	6697960	It was rated by the ESRB, and then it kind of slipped away for a little while.
6697960	6699960	Well, now there's box art. It is really happening.
6699960	6701960	And a PC version.
6701960	6706960	No idea what exactly you do in this game, but damn if you...
6706960	6712960	I mean, I know they say don't judge a game by its cover, but for real, how can I not?
6712960	6716960	It's a freaking dog whisperer game.
6716960	6718960	Please.
6718960	6720960	This game has been judged.
6720960	6722960	Gong.
6722960	6723960	There you have it.
6723960	6725960	The end, dog whisperer.
6725960	6728960	Game Guru says, sounds like another crappy Ubisoft game.
6728960	6729960	That's what most people are saying, actually.
6729960	6730960	Sounds like dog poo.
6730960	6732960	Yeah, the dog pooper.
6732960	6734960	Poobysoft, says Frisbee.
6734960	6735960	I like that.
6735960	6740960	That should be their new name, Poobysoft, whenever they have a crappy game we're talking about on the show.
6740960	6741960	I like that.
6741960	6743960	Don't forget that Poobysoft.
6743960	6749960	Loki's in chat and says it's not as bad as travel games for dummies on the DS and the My Stop Smoking coach.
6749960	6754960	I want to say we talked about that My Stop Smoking coach a few weeks ago when it was first announced.
6754960	6757960	That isn't nearly as bad as the freaking dog whisperer.
6757960	6761960	I see a lot of potential for My Stop Smoking, but dog whisperer?
6761960	6763960	Really?
6763960	6765960	Really?
6765960	6767960	Really?
6767960	6769960	Dog whisperer.
6769960	6771960	How?
6771960	6774960	Pluckyguy wants to see a Dog the Bounty Hunter game.
6774960	6778960	I don't know about that. He's a controversial individual. I don't know if you've heard the stories.
6778960	6781960	Alright, new story, new story.
6781960	6784960	Next story has to do with Space Invaders!
6784960	6786960	The keyboard.
6786960	6790960	They have made a Space Invaders keyboard.
6790960	6799960	And it has little letters on top of the little aliens on the keys and you really can't see them that well unless you're staring at them.
6799960	6802960	And then it has the shooty thing on the space bar.
6802960	6808960	It's a Space Invaders keyboard for PC.
6808960	6813960	I don't know what else I can say about this. It's a Space Invaders keyboard.
6813960	6821960	Look at the bright side. At least this time, unlike the last time we discussed Space Invaders on this show, there's no 9-11 references on this keyboard, correct?
6821960	6825960	I just put a picture of it in the chatroom. It's a Space Invaders keyboard.
6825960	6828960	Is the keyboard 9-11 reference free?
6828960	6831960	Yeah, but it's a Space Invaders keyboard.
6831960	6833960	That should be a sticker they put on the box.
6833960	6841960	You know what I'm going to do when my keyboard dies, especially after I punch it in the face, well, if it had a face, for the stupid fucking drivers not working?
6841960	6843960	Thank God I'm moving to Linux.
6843960	6846960	I'm going to repaint it.
6846960	6849960	Just for fun?
6849960	6851960	I'm going to paint a big Pac-Man on it.
6851960	6853960	You should paint fire on it.
6853960	6855960	I'm going to paint Pac-Man on it, even dots.
6855960	6856960	Paint Pac-Man on fire.
6856960	6858960	Paint your butt on fire.
6858960	6861960	What? I didn't eat Chipotle today.
6861960	6869960	Oh God, you know this show's hit rock bottom when we start making poopy jokes.
6869960	6871960	Anyhow.
6871960	6872960	Dart making?
6872960	6877960	By the way, what a great lead-in to our next story, speaking of a lowest common denominator jokes.
6877960	6880960	I was going to say speaking of flaming butt.
6880960	6888960	Every time the lowest common denominator gets brought up, especially in games, you can't help but reference the game Choeniki.
6888960	6894960	And if you don't know why Choeniki, just Google it. Just Google it and you'll see why.
6894960	6900960	Here's the thing. Choeniki is, this might come as a shock to you, the game is out on Virtual Console in Japan.
6900960	6902960	It actually came out in Europe as well.
6902960	6904960	Here's the thing.
6904960	6910960	It's been rated by the ESRB.
6910960	6912960	That would be the American board.
6912960	6916960	They rated it E10 for mild suggestive themes.
6916960	6918960	No, here's the other thing.
6918960	6921960	It's been dated for Monday.
6921960	6923960	I'm downloading Choeniki.
6923960	6932960	By the time you hear this episode, if this story isn't bullshit, which when the ESRB is involved in, you may be able to play Choeniki on Virtual Console in America.
6932960	6934960	The unthinkable has happened.
6934960	6937960	Jamie has been so excited she dropped her mic.
6937960	6942960	I'm happy. Choeniki is so much fun.
6942960	6946960	I think it's kind of gay, actually.
6946960	6948960	It is very, very, very gay.
6948960	6950960	But in a good way.
6950960	6954960	If you actually go and say, this game is gay, I'm actually going to agree with you.
6954960	6956960	I'm going to be like, yep, it is gay.
6956960	6967960	This game totally does it with other games of the same gender.
6967960	6970960	Frisbee says it is on the Nintendo website.
6970960	6972960	It's happening.
6972960	6977960	And by the way, as if you care, Final Soldier is also supposed to come out tomorrow.
6977960	6980960	Seriously, everything sucks compared to Choeniki.
6980960	6984960	By the way, since we weren't here last week, we might want to mention some other games hit Virtual Console.
6984960	6989960	Clu Clu Land, if you like strange floating objects with hooks trying to reveal coins.
6989960	6993960	I actually played this game a lot in Animal Crossing, because it was one of the games you could get in your house.
6993960	6996960	And then this little game, I don't know if you've heard of it.
6996960	6998960	Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars.
6998960	6999960	You ever heard of that game?
6999960	7000960	Sweet!
7000960	7004960	I think I read an article on it once in Nintendo Power, like in the back of the magazine.
7004960	7006960	It is available now on Virtual Console.
7006960	7008960	And boy was that a quiet release.
7008960	7011960	It just came out on Labor Day while everyone was out of town.
7011960	7013960	You know what I mean?
7013960	7018960	It's kind of a little stealth release there, but I know a lot of people have been waiting for that in all seriousness.
7018960	7022960	Legend of the Seven Stars, finally available on the Virtual Console for download.
7022960	7026960	And as Loki in chat says, and I'm sure he would say if he were here in studio right now,
7026960	7030960	Motherfucking Super Mario RPG!
7030960	7035960	Word, Loki. Word.
7035960	7037960	So, to continue on.
7037960	7039960	Yes, more- Choaniki 2?
7039960	7040960	No!
7040960	7041960	Well, Tipo does want to point out-
7041960	7042960	Sheet music!
7042960	7047960	The first Choaniki game is the tamest in the series, and it is the first game.
7047960	7048960	Sheet music, Rob. Sheet music.
7048960	7050960	Yes, sheet music. What the sheet?
7050960	7052960	Uh-huh-huh.
7052960	7059960	Well, it's sheet music that is titled Killer Instinct 3 Main Title.
7059960	7067960	It could be a fake, it could be photoshoppity, but it's been found somewhere.
7067960	7072960	And it says, uh, a Killer Instinct 3-
7072960	7080960	And by the way, if anyone wants to hop out their MIDI recorder, it actually looks fairly complex, and I can't play that high, so whatever.
7080960	7082960	I'm surprised nobody's tried to turn it into a MIDI file yet.
7082960	7086960	But here's the thing, what if it's just printed out from Cakewalk?
7086960	7090960	Like, it's not that hard to make a fake song and print it out with a fake title.
7090960	7091960	Probably.
7091960	7095960	I just, I don't know, I think it's, my BS meter is going off the charts on this.
7095960	7098960	But you remember the Christmas card thing that Rare did before?
7098960	7099960	Uh-huh.
7099960	7101960	With the KI3 Christmas card?
7101960	7102960	Mm-hmm.
7102960	7113960	Well, there was that, now we have this music, and now there were other rumors that were floating around, like there was the Fulgore picture, remember?
7113960	7114960	Yeah.
7114960	7116960	So, it could happen.
7116960	7118960	And it could not.
7118960	7119960	I liked Killer Instinct.
7119960	7121960	Me too, don't get me wrong, but I don't know.
7121960	7125960	You know, that would be a hell of an announcement, maybe in 2009, we'll see.
7125960	7127960	But I don't know, I'm not gonna hold my breath.
7127960	7137960	I would love nothing more than this, but I can't help but feel like this is a fake, and we're all getting our legs pulled on this one, and I don't like being fooled.
7137960	7138960	Are we being kill rolled?
7138960	7141960	Yes, we're being kill rolled, and I don't like being lied to.
7141960	7145960	And when I feel like I'm being lied to, whether I'm being lied to or not, I get kind of angsty.
7145960	7148960	And when I get angsty, the FUs of the week happen.
7148960	7170960	My FU of the week goes to the man with the small penis driving the truck that uses too much gas at the shopping center where I got my Starbucks from.
7170960	7173960	Stop doing cocaine!
7173960	7179960	Stop doing cocaine!
7179960	7181960	I don't know how much I should say.
7181960	7187960	My FU of the week goes to a particular individual I'm thinking of.
7187960	7191960	No, I don't want to say it, because if you give it attention, it only grows.
7191960	7199960	A particular individual I'm thinking of that really, really needs to stop stalking me.
7199960	7204960	And this isn't a joke. It's not an OLR listener thing. It's something going on in my real life.
7204960	7212960	I honestly feel like I'm being stalked by a certain individual that needs to cut the shit out and just move on with themselves, because it's so frustrating.
7212960	7221960	Stop being immature. Grow up. Grow up. Grow up!
7221960	7223960	That's it.
7223960	7224960	I guess that's it, huh?
7224960	7227960	Yeah, there's no one else here. Just you and me.
7227960	7229960	Well, I'm sure that...
7229960	7231960	Well, then I guess I'll do another story, huh?
7231960	7232960	I was going to say so.
7232960	7241960	All right. Xbox Live. Hey, if I want to take my aggressions out on something, I could punch people, and I will be able to do that in King of Fighters 98.
7241960	7244960	This game is going to Xbox Live Arcade. You know, Fatal Fury...
7244960	7246960	I have several versions of that game.
7246960	7256960	Fatal Fury Special was on Xbox Live Arcade. I don't know if you all remember, but I guess it did well enough that Neo Geo and SNK, they're going to try it again with King of Fighters 98 going to Xbox Live Arcade.
7256960	7264960	It is coming out. It's been re-released on the PlayStation 2 already. There were some extra features, like character balancing, and some new fighters on it.
7264960	7266960	Hopefully the Xbox Live version will have all of this, too.
7266960	7272960	There is no word of a release date yet, but sometime soon.
7272960	7280960	Probably before the end of the year, I'd imagine. King of Fighters 98 on Virtual Console. I might have to check that out. We'll see.
7280960	7291960	Well, in other news, and this makes me specifically happy, and this is what actually brought it to my attention, is that one of my Live Journal friends linked the trailer for Dissidia Final Fantasy.
7291960	7306960	There's a YouTube video up, but basically it's a dramatic progressive action that's supposed to be like a fighting game with an RPG element, I think.
7306960	7310960	But you move through a field map, and then you have to fight different people.
7310960	7322960	It's sort of actually, some of the fighting sequences are actually a lot like what was in Kingdom Hearts 2, where you run up walls and do all kinds of special stuff and earn points.
7322960	7328960	But the cool thing about this is actually who the characters in the games are.
7328960	7338960	Actually, you've got your villains and your heroes. You've got the Warrior of Light from Final Fantasy versus Garland. You have Frienel from Final Fantasy 2, Onion Knight.
7338960	7356960	They've shown Squall and Zidane and Tidus. There's also, for some of the villains, there was the Emperor from Final Fantasy 2, Cloud of Darkness, Golbez, Exdeath, Kefka, Sephiroth, Ultimecia, Kuja, and Jecht from the other ones.
7356960	7367960	I'm sure there's going to be more people from the other Final Fantasy games, some of the heroes coming into it, but I think that's going to be pretty cool. I'm looking forward to it.
7367960	7380960	I have to say, my inner fanboy is very pleased. This game's been a little bit off the radar, but it looks hot. I really want to check this out when it comes out, and I hate admitting that. You know what I mean? But this game looks awesome.
7380960	7388960	It's supposed to be all the major heroes versus the major villains. It has freaking Garland in it. That's awesome.
7388960	7397960	Nomura is doing the character designs, but trying to keep some of Amano's style to it, at least since some of the characters are.
7397960	7411960	But they also said they used Jecht instead of Seymour for the Final Fantasy X references so they didn't have to put Yuna in it. I don't know.
7411960	7417960	Well, there'd be too many people that would get too big of a thrill out of punching Yuna in the face, sadly. Sorry, Yuna fans.
7417960	7423960	And they said that it's actually supposed to have twice as much dialogue as Crisis Core.
7423960	7427960	Dang. All right. This could be fun. We'll see.
7427960	7429960	I'm hoping so.
7429960	7438960	All right. Well, another game that could be fun, Warhammer Online. As you noticed, if you're listening to part A, I had some fairly favorable things to say about the game during my little review of it.
7438960	7442960	I played it at Penny Arcade Expo, and a lot of you have been getting the chance to check this out, too.
7442960	7453960	The open beta launched this weekend playing Warhammer Online. The beta launched earlier this morning. Now, of course, it hasn't gone without some flaws.
7453960	7459960	Apparently, some of the folks outside the United States are having a heck of a time trying to get a Warhammer Online, and they're not happy.
7459960	7466960	And also, apparently, some problems with the server even here in the US. Some folks are having problems getting in, but that's what happens when thousands of people hit this.
7466960	7474960	That's what a beta is for. It is a test process. And AK Ripper is in chat, and I even heard him on Bobby just before we went live. He was complaining about this.
7474960	7479960	And he's in there right now saying, not working. So, yeah, it looks like there's a lot of problems with it.
7479960	7484960	But in theory, the beta is open, but it's probably just going to take a couple days for it to be ironed out.
7484960	7493960	But you know what? Let's look at the long-term thing. It's better this happened now than the day the game is actually supposed to come out and be on shelves and be out there for everybody, right?
7493960	7501960	Is it just me? I don't know. I'd rather this happen now. But of course, then again, if I were one of these people trying to work my butt off to get in, I would probably also be pretty pissed.
7501960	7508960	Especially if I just happen to be outside the United States. That's never cool to get the shaft because of where you live.
7508960	7514960	But in theory, it's up. Hopefully, it'll get ironed out in the next couple days. We'll see.
7514960	7524960	Skype line will be open very soon at www.orangelaunchradio.com. Click on interact with us. Our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio or 1-877-GAMO-LR in the US and Canada.
7524960	7536960	For people who are interested in Call of Duty 5, at least as far as our European listeners, the World at War multiplayer beta will be out for PC and Xbox 360 in October.
7536960	7543960	The PS3 one has not yet been announced. There's a chance it may not happen and nothing about Wii.
7543960	7552960	So, it will be... they say the boot camp will open its doors and they haven't named a date yet.
7552960	7561960	But the speculation, though, would be November 14th for the actual release date.
7561960	7568960	So, they're thinking that it would probably correspond with the US one.
7568960	7577960	At any rate, you'll be able to use the squad system, be able to try some of the other new modes in it, the multiplayer mode.
7577960	7588960	So, it'll be pretty cool and I'd like to see what people think about it. Call of Duty 4 was really freaking cool, so I have high expectations for Call of Duty 5.
7588960	7601960	Alright, well hopefully Call of Duty 5 does not disappoint. Well, that's just about all the video game news we have tonight, but there is one more story about something kind of related to video game and it's something I actually checked out this week.
7601960	7610960	A new site launched. Now, you know, you've got your MySpace, you've got your Facebook, you've got your Twitter, of which, by the way, Orange Launch Radio is on all of those, your live journals and so on.
7610960	7620960	And I'm sure you're thinking, damn, I need another social networking site. Well, another one has launched. It's called Raptor, R-A-P-T-R.
7620960	7626960	Notice there's no O in that. It's just R-A-P-T-R is a new social gaming network site.
7626960	7633960	Here's how it works is basically you punch in all the various codes you have, your Wii code, your Xbox code, your Guitar Hero code.
7633960	7645960	You can also download an optional PC client. And basically what it does is the service kind of watches you on all of these various sites and it tracks all of your gaming progress, so to speak, on one site.
7645960	7653960	Also, it'll let your friends know when you're online and playing games. So if you're actually using the free PC client, like folks can see when I'm playing World of Warcraft.
7653960	7662960	So if you're kind of one of those people that always has a hard time, you know, finding friends to play online games with or whatever, whenever they're online, Raptor could be an option.
7662960	7669960	I definitely want to know more about this site. I'm going to try and get the folks to come on the show, the folks behind Raptor, so we'll see what happens in the upcoming weeks.
7669960	7676960	But yeah, if you want to check it out, the beta is now open, but it is still a beta, so you know it might break, but it's raptor.com.
7676960	7685960	But be careful because sometimes they ask for your Twitter address and stuff. If you put that info in there, it's going to post on Twitter every time you go in to launch a game, and I think that could get very annoying.
7685960	7692960	So I did not link it to my Twitter for that reason. So be careful when you think about those things because these sites really try to get you to link to everything.
7692960	7700960	And you know, they're just trying to hoard out to as many people as possible so that they can get their numbers up and to possibly sell ads or whatever they're going to do in the future.
7700960	7708960	But it could be interesting. So we'll see, we'll see. I really would like to get them on the show and just ask them, you know, what's the point?
7708960	7713960	And maybe they can justify it. I imagine there's got to be a reason to it. They've had a lot of money invested in it.
7713960	7725960	And I believe it's from one of the co-creators of... God, what was the other thing he made? I don't remember. Was it Steam? Don't quote me on that. Somebody in chat will probably remember.
7725960	7728960	The guy made something else that was really big and popular.
7728960	7730960	I don't remember off the top of my head.
7730960	7738960	I don't remember either. But I signed up for it. If you want to send me a friend request, I guess so. Sky is just my name on there, just like Twitter, S-K-I-E.
7738960	7744960	So there you go. Unless you're my stalker, then you can't add me. Sorry.
7744960	7745960	Well.
7745960	7748960	Because I don't need that person finding me in Warcraft.
7748960	7755960	All right. Are there any last minute stories in the house tonight before we open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR?
7755960	7756960	I have none.
7756960	7760960	You have none. I think I might have one. I'll get to it in a little bit. But let's do some calls first.
7760960	7763960	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
7763960	7764960	GS68 here.
7764960	7766960	Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?
7766960	7769960	Last week, I got around to playing Street Fighter IV.
7769960	7771960	And what did you think of Street Fighter IV?
7771960	7776960	Well, I didn't really play it much, so I don't know much about the game mechanics and stuff.
7776960	7786960	But in the first thing, you see the graphics, and they're really nice. My complaint is that the male fighters look a little too muscular.
7786960	7792960	Do the female fighters have too big of boobies? Like everything is really overemphasized or what?
7792960	7793960	I'm not sure.
7793960	7800960	One thing I liked about the setup here at San Jose State was that they had two cabinets, and they're linked up, so that way...
7800960	7807960	Which is good because not only does each player have their own cabinet, like those Japanese cabinets, but...
7807960	7818960	You can also play one-player mode if someone else is already playing in this mode called beginner mode, and it basically lets you go three rounds without anyone challenging you.
7818960	7821960	Which is nice because I suck at fighting games.
7821960	7827960	Give us an idea, how big is this game? I mean, were there just tons and tons of people there to play?
7827960	7834960	There's always people playing. Usually around four or five people, at the least.
7834960	7839960	Is this game really getting out there? I mean, I've been so distracted by all the other goings on in the PAX world and all that.
7839960	7843960	I haven't really been following, but I know it was really big when it got into a couple arcades.
7843960	7848960	Is it slowly finding its way into more and more and more places where it's not too hard to find now?
7848960	7856960	I'm not sure. I had to go down there, only until I went down there to discover that we finally have Street Fighter IV here in the Bay Area.
7856960	7867960	I mean, as I've said before, the arcade scene is dying. I mean, new arcade games tend to catch the gaming community as a whole by surprise these days.
7867960	7874960	Whereas for games on PC and console, we know exactly when they come out, so there's no surprise to that.
7874960	7878960	I do want to point out in chat, IkumaJP has some comments about the Street Fighter IV graphics.
7878960	7882960	Says, the muscle is good, and Chun-Li has an elephant leg.
7882960	7885960	So her legs are even thicker than ever?
7885960	7890960	Chun-Li has amazing thighs. Sheik would put Mary Lou Rhett into shame.
7890960	7891960	There you go.
7891960	7894960	Okay, I actually have the hentai of her.
7894960	7898960	GS68, any other thoughts on Street Fighter IV before we get to another call?
7898960	7905960	Um, she has something else to say, but I forgot. Oh yeah, now that Super Mario RPG is out, I can't wait for all of you game fans to complain.
7905960	7908960	Where's my Earthbound? Where's my Earthbound?
7908960	7910960	I'll start. Where's my Earthbound?
7910960	7911960	Oh.
7911960	7914960	Alright, have a good one, GS68. Take care, buddy.
7914960	7915960	You too.
7915960	7916960	Bye.
7916960	7921960	Pluckyguy in chat says, I kinda like Chun-Li's jungle booty.
7921960	7924960	Nothing wrong with a big butt. 1877.
7924960	7926960	Just rub like big butts and cannot lie.
7926960	7928960	You other brothers can't deny.
7928960	7930960	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype.
7930960	7936960	Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call here live on this Sunday evening, September the 7th of 2008.
7936960	7938960	Let's go to the phones.
7938960	7940960	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7943960	7944960	Hello?
7944960	7946960	Hello, hi, who's this? You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7946960	7947960	Hello, this is Seg.
7947960	7950960	Hey, Seg, my friend. How are you?
7950960	7952960	I'm doing quite alright, and yourself?
7952960	7954960	I am doing awesome.
7954960	7955960	Hello, I met you.
7955960	7956960	Yep.
7956960	7957960	Yep.
7957960	7959960	Seg was one of my buddies. He lives in the Bay Area.
7959960	7961960	The cupcake shop or store, right?
7961960	7964960	Yes, he told the cupcake story, but nobody's gonna get that.
7964960	7967960	He also wore the manly corset one day, which was great.
7967960	7969960	That was a fabulously manly corset.
7969960	7971960	Definitely showed off your hourglass figure.
7971960	7974960	And only three jerks that day, too.
7974960	7981960	I was quite surprised that there weren't as many jerks there.
7981960	7982960	Welcomely surprised.
7982960	7985960	You know, just be glad you weren't the guy in the Princess Peach outfit,
7985960	7987960	because his picture got a lot of stuff.
7987960	7989960	Okay, I have standards.
7989960	7991960	I don't know. You know what? You've inspired me, Seg.
7991960	7994960	Next year, I'm gonna push the cross-dressing envelope.
7994960	7996960	No, no, no. I wasn't cross-dressing.
7996960	7998960	I know you weren't. I know you weren't, but I'm just saying.
7998960	8000960	I'm just making sure for everyone else listening in.
8000960	8006960	I want to incorporate a little more femininity into my outfits.
8006960	8010960	I don't know. I just think you need to parade through the con as Frank.
8010960	8013960	Oh, should I bring my full Frank-N-Furter regalia next year?
8013960	8014960	Bring it.
8014960	8015960	If they'd let me in.
8015960	8017960	And you also need the curly mullet wig.
8017960	8018960	Forget it. I'm sorry.
8018960	8021960	Seg probably had things he wanted to talk about that aren't corsets.
8021960	8023960	What's on your mind, Seg?
8023960	8027960	Well, it is in the similar vein of PAX.
8027960	8029960	I couldn't really look up for any confirmation,
8029960	8034960	but I heard talks that PAX is thinking about doing East Coast.
8034960	8040960	But what I want to propose out to listeners and all that is,
8040960	8044960	how do you think the whole convention dynamic would change
8044960	8051960	with a major East Coast specific for video games conference?
8051960	8052960	I do want to say this real quick.
8052960	8055960	It has been confirmed by the Penny Arcade Expo organizers,
8055960	8056960	Boston in 2010.
8056960	8058960	They have already booked the venue, apparently.
8058960	8060960	Okay. I just wasn't 100%. I forgot where I read it.
8060960	8062960	No, that's all right.
8062960	8064960	Timing is everything, in my opinion.
8064960	8066960	I think they can get away with doing two shows in a year
8066960	8068960	if they're really well spaced out,
8068960	8071960	especially if it's true that they're doing it in April,
8071960	8072960	that's not a bad time to do it
8072960	8074960	because you have a lot of game releases.
8074960	8075960	When are most games released?
8075960	8077960	They're released in the early summer,
8077960	8078960	or they're released right before Christmas.
8078960	8082960	So if you have your early April show promoting those spring games,
8082960	8085960	and you have the August show promoting the holiday games,
8085960	8087960	which PAX is kind of doing,
8087960	8089960	I think they can pull it off.
8089960	8093960	I would be very curious to see, though, if it ends up kind of,
8093960	8096960	if each con kind of eats each other,
8096960	8097960	but maybe that's what they want.
8097960	8098960	And when I say that, I mean, you know,
8098960	8100960	is attendance going to go down at one
8100960	8102960	because now they have this other one available,
8102960	8104960	but maybe in a way that's what they want.
8104960	8107960	Maybe that's how they're trying to control Seattle from getting too big.
8107960	8108960	Go ahead.
8108960	8113960	Well, to me, as someone who lived in the East Coast and the Midwest,
8113960	8117960	I grew up in Michigan and also lived in Boston for a few years.
8117960	8122960	There are comic conventions.
8122960	8127960	There's conventions that add on video games,
8127960	8130960	but it wasn't front and center.
8130960	8134960	And everything else that really makes front and center for video games
8134960	8137960	is all pretty much predominantly on the West Coast.
8137960	8139960	So I'm really interested to see.
8139960	8144960	I personally think that if nothing else comes down,
8144960	8147960	a large big name on the East Coast,
8147960	8151960	that PAX really has a very interesting opportunity here
8151960	8157960	to be something, to really fulfill a demand
8157960	8160960	that hasn't been filled yet with East Coast
8160960	8162960	because you've got all the people that wanted to go
8162960	8164960	but couldn't make that big, huge stretch out there.
8164960	8166960	Now it's a little bit more easier.
8166960	8168960	It's like, oh, it's just a weekend instead of,
8168960	8173960	or it's less than a day to get there versus a flight across the country.
8173960	8175960	There's a lot of people in chat saying that there's not enough game companies
8175960	8177960	on the East Coast, but I kind of disagree.
8177960	8180960	Harmonix, 2K.
8180960	8182960	And don't forget the folks in Toronto.
8182960	8183960	It's not that far away for them.
8183960	8186960	It's closer for them to go there than to go to Seattle.
8186960	8188960	So I don't know. I beg to differ.
8188960	8190960	I think they could get a decent show out of it.
8190960	8193960	And there will be those folks that travel.
8193960	8194960	Why not?
8194960	8198960	The Warhammer people were just in Texas the week before.
8198960	8201960	A lot of these folks travel to these different things.
8201960	8203960	Well, I know there's people that definitely travel,
8203960	8210960	but there's a lot of friends I have in both of those regions
8210960	8215960	that definitely can't schedule out such a huge disruption
8215960	8218960	to take a lot of time off board because they have to fly across the country.
8218960	8223960	But if it was right in their hometown or very close by,
8223960	8225960	that's a lot of names there.
8225960	8227960	And as far as not as many,
8227960	8232960	the total amount of studios between the coast definitely leans towards the West Coast.
8232960	8236960	But there's still a lot of big-name studios that had to fly everything else over.
8236960	8239960	And not every West Coast studio went to PAX either.
8239960	8242960	I made fun of Capcom earlier, and Konami was another big name that wasn't there.
8242960	8244960	Not everybody's going to PAX yet.
8244960	8245960	Yeah, exactly.
8245960	8248960	So I think that also works to their advantage, but they'll still get big names,
8248960	8253960	but they're not going to be flooding the doors like, say, Comic-Con on vendors.
8253960	8256960	It could be interesting. I wonder how many people would go to both.
8256960	8258960	I'm crazy enough I would want to go to both.
8258960	8259960	Me too.
8259960	8260960	I love the East Coast and I wouldn't want to go visit.
8260960	8263960	But I also have places to crash at. I have plenty of friends to crash at.
8263960	8265960	Especially if the shows are different enough.
8265960	8268960	If you do get those different exhibitors that show up on the East Coast versus the West Coast,
8268960	8271960	I think it could be sustainable for two cons.
8271960	8274960	And shit, if they're serious about doing the Europe con too,
8274960	8276960	shit, people would probably go to that too.
8276960	8278960	I mean, I don't know if we would because it's a lot harder.
8278960	8281960	When you talk international flight, that's a big one.
8281960	8285960	But I'm sure if they're doing Eurogamer Expo
8285960	8287960	and Leipzig is growing leaps and bounds,
8287960	8290960	what they were saying, what, like 200,000 frickin' people at Leipzig or something?
8290960	8293960	Hell, you know, my co-workers were at Leipzig.
8293960	8295960	Yeesh. Yeesh.
8295960	8299960	So, Bobby Black Wolf's in chat and says, I do eight hours from each.
8299960	8303960	And a lot of folks in chat are saying, I would love to go to Paxi's
8303960	8304960	and I know I would like to go too.
8304960	8307960	And act deft, our poor listener in Mexico says,
8307960	8309960	I would just like to have a Mexico con, please.
8309960	8311960	Start one.
8311960	8312960	You never know.
8312960	8314960	Call it Mexican.
8314960	8316960	Mexican? I like that.
8316960	8318960	Yeah.
8318960	8321960	All right, Seg, we got a long call, but it's been a great call,
8321960	8322960	but I got to wrap it up.
8322960	8325960	Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners before we go to the next call?
8325960	8328960	Well, you know, I have to self-promote.
8328960	8331960	All cool and attractive people, and that includes you,
8331960	8335960	must look into getting Strong Bad.
8335960	8337960	Have to plug my own thing.
8337960	8338960	I didn't know if you wanted to talk about that,
8338960	8340960	but yes, you worked on the Strong Bad game,
8340960	8342960	so you're very excited about the release.
8342960	8343960	And I hear it's doing very well, right?
8343960	8345960	What, third week in a row it's top of the charts on Wii?
8345960	8346960	Third week on the top of the charts.
8346960	8348960	All right, let's go for four.
8348960	8349960	All right, take care.
8349960	8350960	All right, take care, buddy.
8350960	8351960	Yep.
8351960	8352960	All right, bye-bye.
8352960	8355960	All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
8355960	8356960	our username on Skype.
8356960	8359960	Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.
8359960	8362960	I'd be so down with Pax Boston, wouldn't you?
8362960	8365960	I would be down if someone would pay my way.
8365960	8367960	If we can make it work, we never know.
8367960	8368960	All right, let's get another phone call.
8368960	8369960	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8369960	8371960	Who's this?
8371960	8372960	Hey, it's the Rob D.
8372960	8373960	Hey, Rob D.
8373960	8374960	Hello.
8374960	8376960	What is on your mind, my friend?
8376960	8377960	Not too much.
8377960	8378960	I hope this connection actually works out pretty well
8378960	8382960	because I'm on a new ISP, so this connection may drop.
8382960	8383960	So far, so good.
8383960	8385960	Just wanted to talk about Pax, really.
8385960	8388960	Not too much.
8388960	8390960	Well, what did you think of Pax, please?
8390960	8391960	Walk us through it.
8391960	8392960	Fair enough.
8392960	8393960	I saw you guys there, which is excellent,
8393960	8395960	and actually I saw many all-gamers there.
8395960	8398960	I think about 25 somewhere around there.
8398960	8400960	It actually ended up being a very good all-games meetup,
8400960	8402960	a very good OLR meetup.
8402960	8404960	I had Kevin DDR from the OLR chat room
8404960	8406960	and some other just really great people.
8406960	8408960	I mean, I was really surprised that...
8408960	8409960	Well, I shouldn't say that.
8409960	8410960	I shouldn't say that I was surprised,
8410960	8413960	but it was really great to see that everyone there
8413960	8414960	was really just a cool person.
8414960	8419960	No one misrepresented themselves online in any way.
8419960	8421960	Everyone was just a lot of fun to be around.
8421960	8423960	I know this is something we usually say in the past.
8423960	8425960	I don't think all games really does this,
8425960	8427960	but it was nice to see that everybody kind of adopted
8427960	8429960	that creed of don't be a dick.
8429960	8431960	Nobody was an asshole, which is a good thing.
8431960	8433960	Well, that's because Wil Wheaton had a sign up
8433960	8435960	that said don't be a dick.
8435960	8437960	Except for me.
8437960	8438960	I was an asshole.
8438960	8441960	Rob was the biggest diva the whole time.
8441960	8443960	I'm king of nice, damn it.
8443960	8444960	No, but seriously, in all seriousness,
8444960	8446960	everybody was cool.
8446960	8447960	You know what I mean?
8447960	8449960	Sometimes when you meet strangers from the internet,
8449960	8450960	you get a few weirdos in there,
8450960	8452960	but everybody was pretty cool.
8452960	8453960	You know what I mean?
8453960	8454960	Having dinner with you guys
8454960	8456960	and actually being able to talk with you guys.
8456960	8459960	I will admit that when we were actually broadcasting,
8459960	8462960	just being surrounded by Bobby,
8462960	8465960	you, Dark Sakura, and Loki,
8465960	8467960	I was like, what am I doing here?
8467960	8468960	I don't belong here.
8468960	8470960	You were being awesome is what you were doing.
8470960	8471960	It was great.
8471960	8473960	Even when I was looking at some of the other people
8473960	8475960	who I've listened to their shows,
8475960	8478960	like Luke from Game Addict Hotline, Ninja Sister,
8478960	8480960	some of the people that were there,
8480960	8482960	just kind of hearing them,
8482960	8484960	and I know people have said this about me too
8484960	8485960	when they've met me,
8485960	8487960	hearing them talk and hearing the radio voice
8487960	8489960	as they're sitting right there in front of you
8489960	8490960	is kind of strange.
8490960	8491960	You know what I mean?
8491960	8494960	I don't know if you felt that.
8494960	8496960	It's weird because you're so used to hearing it in the iPod,
8496960	8498960	you don't really see these people,
8498960	8499960	myself included,
8499960	8502960	but then to see it all unfold live at PAX
8502960	8503960	was kind of weird.
8503960	8506960	I think Decipher was one of the people that said that too.
8506960	8509960	Man, it's kind of weird to actually see you guys
8509960	8511960	while you're talking.
8511960	8513960	Yeah, he definitely said that.
8513960	8516960	He actually said that when he stepped up to the mic,
8516960	8517960	he was shaking a little bit,
8517960	8518960	which I thought was kind of funny,
8518960	8520960	although I shouldn't make fun of him too much.
8520960	8521960	I mean, it's probably the first time
8521960	8523960	he's ever done anything like that
8523960	8525960	over the internet and broadcasting, that sort of thing.
8525960	8527960	Yeah, you learn it's no big deal.
8527960	8529960	Any schmo can get an internet show, right?
8529960	8530960	It's true.
8530960	8531960	All right.
8531960	8534960	What about the actual games and sights and sounds of PAX?
8534960	8538960	What kind of games did you play at PAX that you liked?
8538960	8540960	Well, I played Mortal Kombat vs. DC,
8540960	8544960	which surprised me because it was actually fun.
8544960	8545960	It's a Mortal Kombat game.
8545960	8546960	It'll never be a competitive fighter.
8546960	8547960	That's not what Mortal Kombat's for.
8547960	8551960	Mortal Kombat's really just for the fatalities,
8551960	8553960	all the fun party game stuff,
8553960	8556960	watching someone break someone else's body over their back
8556960	8560960	and seeing 18 tibias and fibulas fly,
8560960	8562960	even though no human could possibly have
8562960	8564960	that many bones in their body.
8564960	8568960	They were all the same bone over and over.
8568960	8570960	Exactly.
8570960	8572960	But what else did I see?
8572960	8574960	The TNA Impact game,
8574960	8576960	which I am a little bit of a wrestling fan,
8576960	8578960	so I had to play that.
8578960	8579960	It was sad.
8579960	8580960	No one was playing that one.
8580960	8581960	I actually went up there.
8581960	8582960	One of the developers was there by himself
8582960	8583960	playing his own game,
8583960	8586960	which was kind of sad in a way.
8586960	8588960	I went up there and played him,
8588960	8589960	and it was a good time.
8589960	8591960	You made his day, probably.
8591960	8593960	Probably, although not as much as I made the day.
8593960	8595960	I think it's Locks Quest, people,
8595960	8597960	because one of them actually stood right by me
8597960	8599960	and walked me through the game
8599960	8604960	and explained the different steps of development.
8604960	8607960	They have no idea who I am.
8607960	8609960	They're hoping that I'm probably some gaming journalist,
8609960	8610960	but I'm just a fan,
8610960	8611960	and they're taking all this time to tell me
8611960	8613960	because I'm probably the first person to go by there.
8613960	8617960	Tower Defense games are not exactly big things at PAX.
8617960	8618960	Those poor guys.
8618960	8619960	I've got to say, though,
8619960	8620960	PAX does give a really good shot
8620960	8622960	to the indie developers and stuff,
8622960	8624960	especially with that PAX 10 thing.
8624960	8626960	Those 10 indie games were right in the middle of the show floor.
8626960	8627960	You can't miss them.
8627960	8629960	That's probably how Jamie got caught
8629960	8631960	with the sushi game and all that stuff.
8631960	8632960	Those guys were great,
8632960	8634960	but they were tucked away in the corner.
8634960	8637960	They don't really have the Kensha Hall syndrome
8637960	8638960	that E3 has,
8638960	8640960	where the weird stuff goes to Kensha Hall.
8640960	8641960	You've got to go to the basement.
8641960	8643960	You know what I mean?
8643960	8646960	I never actually made my way over to the PAX 10,
8646960	8649960	so I can't say whether that was actually good or not.
8649960	8651960	From what I hear, it was okay, at the very least.
8651960	8653960	I got so much swag from PAX.
8653960	8654960	I got three different shirts.
8654960	8656960	I got a bunch of Rockstar stickers.
8656960	8657960	I got, what else did I get?
8657960	8660960	I didn't actually manage to get one of those energy drink samples,
8660960	8662960	which I don't know if you went by there.
8662960	8664960	That energy drink booth that was kind of packed away in the corner.
8664960	8666960	You thought they were giving away free cans of their drink,
8666960	8668960	but it was really, I don't know,
8668960	8670960	a hundred empty cans just sitting on the table.
8670960	8672960	I know. I saw that one.
8672960	8674960	They want you to sign up to win a case or something.
8674960	8675960	Something like that.
8675960	8677960	I did sign up, though, for the ECA,
8677960	8679960	and they were giving out balls geek beer.
8679960	8681960	Really? I didn't see that.
8681960	8682960	Oh, it was so good.
8682960	8685960	Root beer with caffeine.
8685960	8686960	Ooh.
8686960	8688960	That does sound good.
8688960	8689960	What else did I see?
8689960	8691960	I didn't manage to actually play any of the games that had a gigantic line,
8691960	8692960	like Little Big Planet.
8692960	8694960	I just kind of stayed away from those.
8694960	8695960	Aw, you missed out.
8695960	8697960	Little Big Planet was great.
8697960	8699960	Now, granted, you know, we were a little spoiled
8699960	8700960	since we got to go in a little bit early.
8700960	8701960	You know, there wasn't a line for it.
8701960	8704960	And we got to get walked through by the US producer.
8704960	8708960	And, yeah, I was spoiled, but, man, so worth it.
8708960	8711960	I'm all about Little Big Planet now.
8711960	8714960	Yeah, I have expected the Sonic RPG to be horrible.
8714960	8715960	I went by the Sega booth,
8715960	8717960	which took me a little while to find at first
8717960	8721960	until I realized that there was a gigantic Sega sign.
8721960	8725960	Do you know we didn't even realize Sega was there until day two?
8725960	8727960	I mean, they didn't exactly...
8727960	8729960	Like, there weren't any Sega signs on the booth itself.
8729960	8731960	It was just the giant Sega sign hanging from the ceiling,
8731960	8733960	and you wouldn't really notice that
8733960	8735960	unless you were a really far distance away.
8735960	8738960	And by that point, you may have gotten distracted by tons of other booths.
8738960	8740960	You know, you're going toward the Sega booth,
8740960	8742960	and they're like, ooh, Afro Samurai, I should play that,
8742960	8743960	which is also great.
8743960	8745960	That game was hot.
8745960	8749960	I love the Little Red Riding Hood killing the zombies game.
8749960	8750960	That was hot, too.
8750960	8751960	That was funny.
8751960	8753960	All right, Rob D., we got to wrap it up here
8753960	8754960	because we can probably get one more call,
8754960	8759960	but quickly, best thing about PAX and worst thing about PAX?
8759960	8762960	Best thing about PAX, the people, without question.
8762960	8764960	I like the con, I like the exhibitors hall,
8764960	8766960	but, you know, actually being able to see everyone
8766960	8768960	and talk with the people that I've been chatting with
8768960	8770960	over the last few years was just,
8770960	8772960	really just made for an unparalleled experience at any con I've been to.
8772960	8774960	Aw, I'm getting a little choked up here.
8774960	8775960	The amount of people.
8775960	8777960	The amount of people, by far.
8777960	8779960	I couldn't actually make it into any panel without waiting,
8779960	8781960	like, at least an hour in line,
8781960	8784960	and by the time I saw how long the lines were,
8784960	8787960	I just, I didn't even try.
8787960	8790960	Yeah, something was going to have to be done about that for next year.
8790960	8793960	I don't know what, but they'll think of something fair.
8793960	8794960	We'll see.
8794960	8796960	Maybe they'll get to organize it,
8796960	8797960	they'll figure out how to organize it better.
8797960	8799960	I mean, the fact is that they've only had five years,
8799960	8801960	which isn't really a long amount of time for any con,
8801960	8803960	especially when they've been in the Seattle Convention Center for,
8803960	8804960	I think, two years.
8804960	8805960	True, very true.
8805960	8807960	And there's a whole sixth floor,
8807960	8809960	I bet they're going to have to open it next year, we'll see.
8809960	8810960	Because what was going on?
8810960	8811960	Thanks for taking my call.
8811960	8813960	Gender odyssey was going on at the same time we were there?
8813960	8814960	I think so.
8814960	8816960	Yeah, they kind of kept that on the down low,
8816960	8821960	which is probably a good idea with how immature gamers can be on occasion.
8821960	8823960	Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't have cared, you know,
8823960	8825960	heck, with all the years I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show,
8825960	8826960	I've seen everything.
8826960	8831960	But, you know, I think it's kind of interesting how segregated they kept the two.
8831960	8832960	Very interesting.
8832960	8834960	All right, Rob D., thanks for the call.
8834960	8835960	Take care, buddy.
8835960	8836960	And good to meet you.
8836960	8837960	Yep, you too.
8837960	8838960	We'll see you next year, right?
8838960	8839960	Hopefully.
8839960	8840960	All right.
8840960	8841960	Work on it.
8841960	8842960	Save your pennies now.
8842960	8843960	All right, see you.
8843960	8845960	That's all I'm going to have to do is start saving now.
8845960	8848960	I think we can fit in one more call.
8848960	8851960	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8851960	8855960	I think after one more call we should be good here.
8855960	8857960	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8857960	8858960	Who's this?
8858960	8859960	Hello, guy.
8859960	8862960	And, like, it's Blade 3.
8862960	8863960	Blade 3?
8863960	8865960	What is on your mind, Blade 3?
8865960	8866960	Not much.
8866960	8867960	It's kind of late where I am.
8867960	8868960	Where are you?
8868960	8869960	Are you on the East Coast?
8869960	8871960	Yeah, it's 12.
8871960	8872960	All right.
8872960	8874960	It's way past everyone's bedtime over there.
8874960	8875960	But that's all right.
8875960	8876960	We're trying to wrap up the show.
8876960	8877960	See how I can go to bed.
8877960	8878960	What's on your mind?
8878960	8879960	What did you call in about tonight?
8879960	8883960	Well, I just wanted to tell Rocky, because I'm sure he's still listening,
8883960	8888960	that I figured out my own coding for my website.
8888960	8892960	Oh, you sent us an email wanting Loki's source code.
8892960	8893960	All right.
8893960	8896960	Well, I'm sorry to hear he isn't going to give it up,
8896960	8897960	but I understand at the same time.
8897960	8899960	He still wants to make improvements to it and everything,
8899960	8903960	and there's still probably a lot he wants to do with it.
8903960	8904960	But that's good.
8904960	8907960	You know, hey, nothing like being inspired by something else
8907960	8908960	to make your own thing.
8908960	8911960	In fact, I think that's kind of how Loki made that listener site,
8911960	8913960	is that I think he saw some other stuff
8913960	8916960	and kind of tried to make it even better.
8916960	8919960	So that's how it was born.
8919960	8926960	Yeah, so I made my own, and you can check it out at mmtsp.tk.
8926960	8927960	Nice.
8927960	8928960	I love that he's working in a plug.
8928960	8931960	What will I find on this wonderful PSP site?
8931960	8936960	Right now it's in a shimmy data.
8936960	8938960	Basically there's just one page,
8938960	8942960	and it just has links to other pages with nothing on them so far.
8942960	8943960	All right.
8943960	8945960	Well, you got to start somewhere.
8945960	8951960	By the end of the week, I should have quite a few demos and DVDs,
8951960	8954960	some funny videos, and some soundtracks from games.
8954960	8955960	All right.
8955960	8957960	All right, young entrepreneur,
8957960	8959960	we wish you the best of luck with your site.
8959960	8962960	Anything else you want to talk about tonight?
8962960	8963960	One more thing.
8963960	8965960	Yes.
8965960	8968960	I'm making a PSP site as an add-on to my regular site,
8968960	8974960	and my regular site is masterman.tk.
8974960	8976960	Plug, plug, plug, plug.
8976960	8978960	You know, we're going to start charging 50 bucks a plug,
8978960	8979960	just so you know.
8979960	8981960	All right, best of luck with your sites, buddy.
8981960	8982960	All right.
8982960	8983960	Have fun.
8983960	8984960	All right.
8984960	8986960	So all of our listeners need to go visit these sites,
8986960	8988960	and if they're terrible, I want you to tear this guy apart.
8988960	8989960	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
8989960	8990960	You got to start somewhere.
8990960	8993960	We're all about supporting the independents and new ideas.
8993960	8995960	And, you know, PSP sites aren't really getting enough love.
8995960	8997960	I mean, sure, there's a few sites out there,
8997960	8999960	but, man, that's a whole universe.
8999960	9001960	It's not really being explored as well as it could be.
9001960	9003960	So, someday.
9003960	9005960	All right, well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9005960	9006960	Sorry for those that didn't get through,
9006960	9007960	but you can always send us an email,
9007960	9008960	mailbagorangelaundry.com.
9008960	9010960	Give Jamie some work to do next week.
9010960	9012960	Make her read more emails, right, Jamie?
9012960	9013960	No.
9013960	9014960	I actually have stories.
9014960	9015960	Oh, you have a last-minute story or two?
9015960	9016960	Things popped up.
9016960	9017960	Go for it.
9017960	9019960	Just in case no one knew,
9019960	9022960	Microsoft actually did lower the download content prices.
9022960	9025960	I have the list of what they lowered.
9025960	9026960	Cool.
9026960	9027960	Have we mentioned this before?
9027960	9028960	I don't think so.
9028960	9032960	I think it was a sale that was only for this weekend.
9032960	9033960	I believe so.
9033960	9034960	Could be wrong.
9034960	9035960	I don't remember.
9035960	9039960	But Mass Effect went down to 300 points of Bring Down the Sky.
9039960	9042960	Lost Odyssey Triple Bonus Pack went to 120.
9042960	9045960	Forza Motorsport 2, the Motegi Track Pack,
9045960	9051960	and the September, December, March car packs went down to 240 each.
9051960	9055960	Oblivion Elder Scrolls IV Shivering Isles went to 1600.
9055960	9057960	Guitar Hero 3, Def Leppard, Foo Fighters,
9057960	9060960	Classic Rock Track Packs to 360.
9060960	9064960	Beautiful Katamari, the Accessory ABCD set went to 120.
9064960	9066960	Special Accessory as well.
9066960	9068960	Just Size stage went to 120.
9068960	9073960	And the Big 10, 11 stages went to 140.
9073960	9076960	So that's it.
9076960	9077960	All right.
9077960	9078960	I like sales.
9078960	9079960	I like cheap things.
9079960	9081960	All right.
9081960	9082960	I do have a last minute story real quick.
9082960	9084960	It has to do with the Max Payne movie.
9084960	9085960	Tiger Claw sent me this one.
9085960	9087960	I remember reading about this earlier in the week.
9087960	9088960	It didn't make our show roll, though.
9088960	9092960	But apparently the Max Payne movie has been rated R and not happy.
9092960	9094960	John Moore, the director of the movie, is pissed.
9094960	9097960	It was supposed to be a PG-13 movie.
9097960	9099960	I'm hoping he's lobbying the MPAA.
9099960	9101960	What a bunch of fuck wads.
9101960	9103960	I mean, really, have you heard about some of the shit they pull?
9103960	9106960	I just, I hate the MPAA.
9106960	9107960	I really do.
9107960	9112960	You know, the fact that they, God, that movies can be so freaking violent and crazy and,
9112960	9116960	you know, they get an R, but heaven forbid you show a wiener or some titties and, you
9116960	9118960	know, you risk getting an NC-17.
9118960	9121960	It's just horrible what they've done.
9121960	9127960	Anyhow, the MPAA has slapped an R on this movie, which means it's not going to be able to be
9127960	9130960	seen by teenagers, which who knows, maybe it really is for the best.
9130960	9132960	Maybe we have blurred the lines too much with what is safe.
9132960	9134960	Max Payne, I would definitely put an R on that.
9134960	9139960	Well, apparently, though, he actually, he did try to dumb it down a little bit.
9139960	9142960	Like, he actually kind of cut out some of the language.
9142960	9144960	No heads are cut off.
9144960	9146960	No eyeballs are ripped out or any of that stuff.
9146960	9150960	He actually did tame it down a bit to try and get the PG-13 and still got the R.
9150960	9155960	So he was kind of, kind of miffed about that, as you can understand.
9155960	9156960	But here's the thing.
9156960	9162960	He actually goes, so far as to say, they gave The Dark Knight a PG-13 rating and basically
9162960	9164960	sucked Warner Brothers' cock.
9164960	9166960	His words, not mine.
9166960	9168960	But you know, yeah, it's something to think about.
9168960	9171960	You know, The Dark Knight was a pretty dark film too.
9171960	9177960	I think it just goes to show the MPAA is fucked.
9177960	9179960	So fire them all, that's what I say.
9179960	9181960	And then, yeah, that's another thing I've been thinking about.
9181960	9184960	And Quel Tipo brings us up, that Zack and Miri make a porno.
9184960	9185960	I don't know if you've heard about this.
9185960	9190960	The Kevin Smith movie was originally rated NC-17 because, oh my God, porno.
9190960	9192960	They were able to talk it down to an R somehow.
9192960	9197960	But then they ended up banning the first poster for the movie because it implied that there
9197960	9199960	was oral sex.
9199960	9201960	Get over it.
9201960	9202960	I don't know.
9202960	9205960	It's just a little stupid.
9205960	9208960	Quel Tipo does say though, and I think this is interesting, I'd be more willing to see
9208960	9212960	an R-rated Max Payne than a PG-13 version.
9212960	9213960	Tigerclaw says, here's the thing.
9213960	9218960	The first Mortal Kombat movie was PG-13 even though it was based on an M-rated game.
9218960	9221960	The movie wins you back because of all the kick-ass fight sequences.
9221960	9223960	Hmm, something to think about.
9223960	9225960	So lots of good points made by everybody.
9225960	9228960	All right, well, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9228960	9230960	Hey, thanks, you guys, for sticking with us tonight.
9230960	9234960	And myself and Dark Soccer are holding down the fort.
9234960	9238960	It was very lovely having you all in chat tonight to help fill in as our third host tonight.
9238960	9240960	We always love having you guys on the program.
9240960	9242960	Thank you, guys.
9242960	9246960	And so we're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.
9246960	9249960	Final thoughts, Dark Soccer, your final thought?
9249960	9251960	Poop.
9251960	9252960	Lovely.
9252960	9256960	My final thought is fart.
9256960	9259960	Hey, no, no, you said fart, so I have to say dick.
9259960	9261960	All right.
9261960	9263960	We have some other final thoughts from chat.
9263960	9266960	Shaq-Fu, that's a good final thought.
9266960	9268960	Your Shaq-Fu moment of the day.
9268960	9269960	All right, that's going to do it.
9269960	9272960	Hey, guys, thank you so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting
9272960	9275960	like Orange Lounge Radio where dick and fart jokes are still okay.
9275960	9277960	We haven't sold out yet.
9277960	9279960	What about boob and burp jokes?
9279960	9281960	Boob and burp jokes are always welcome.
9281960	9285960	Thank you, guys, so much for supporting us and leaving us the nice things you have been on iTunes lately.
9285960	9287960	There's been a couple people that added reviews.
9287960	9289960	Thank you, guys, so much for your kind reviews.
9289960	9291960	We'd always appreciate a few more five-star reviews.
9291960	9295960	It really helps out our ranking and, therefore, as we get bumped up in the rankings, we're more visible.
9295960	9298960	Even if you can't do that, just tell a couple friends about the show.
9298960	9299960	That's all we ask.
9299960	9301960	That's our super powers, extra visibility.
9301960	9302960	You got it.
9302960	9303960	Word of mouth.
9303960	9304960	And how.
9304960	9305960	We have no magazine.
9305960	9307960	We have no corporate-funded website.
9307960	9309960	We don't sell ads.
9309960	9312960	It's all about the word of mouth, so we appreciate it.
9312960	9314960	But I do sell my virtual body on the internet.
9314960	9315960	Just kidding.
9315960	9321960	Until next time and until the next Penny Arcade Expo to see some of you guys again in person,
9321960	9322960	although hopefully not.
9322960	9323960	We'll see some of you guys around.
9323960	9329960	There's certainly talk of ASEN for next year and definitely E for All for me, so we'll be seeing you guys later.
9329960	9333960	But until next week, when Loki will be back, this is Rob Roberts.
9333960	9334960	She's Dark Sakura.
9334960	9336960	He's at home listening, Loki.
9336960	9337960	We'll all be back next week.
9337960	9338960	We are together.
