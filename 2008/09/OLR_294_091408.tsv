16733	19498	Could a Wii storage problem solution finally be coming?
19858	26670	The Mortal Kombat vs DC roster leaks thanks to its achievements, and the first details emerge on DJ Hero.
31752	35754	Hello everybody out there on the internets and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35874	41516	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41536	46739	It's where every gamer has a voice, including you guys when you join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
46759	52641	But the voices you'll probably hear most are myself, Rob Roberts, and with me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
53101	53321	Hi.
53602	55262	How you doing, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?
55402	55762	I'm here.
56123	57883	It's almost like your new name, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
58424	58904	Not really, though.
59404	64053	Just don't call me Bob Okay, Bob Alright, also joining us tonight You know what, Rob?
65276	67877	Returning after being on vacation last week.
67917	74760	I don't know who told him he could take a week off, but apparently he took it upon himself to take a week off after being so exhausted from Penny Arcade Expo.
74780	75660	It's Techmaster Loki.
76020	76240	Hey.
76741	77261	So what was it?
77301	78561	The day job kept you away, right?
78721	80362	Yeah, I had to go to San Francisco.
80462	81222	Oh, you poor thing.
81943	84644	You had to get bought fancy dinners by the company, I'm sure, huh?
84664	84904	Yes.
85744	86525	You poor, poor thing.
87185	88545	Any game-related things you saw?
88785	91427	Oh, you probably can't talk about them even if you did, huh?
91627	92367	No, I didn't.
93027	94808	No, everything there is just like...
96209	96570	I don't know.
96590	97871	Like company related stuff.
98472	105061	They, I mean, they mentioned a few like release seats for movies that, you know, it's, I don't know.
105221	105642	But nothing.
106062	106383	Nothing.
106503	107424	There's no game stuff.
107724	109547	They just like, oh yeah, we do games too.
109567	111129	It's in more
111989	112930	It's all movie stuff.
113830	117072	They gave everyone a $1,500 trip to one of ten locations.
119113	120694	Well, that's just $1,500.
122495	126657	You have to book your own trip, so that may cover your flight and that's about it.
127897	128958	We could go to what, Fresno?
130486	131827	No, it's one of ten locations.
131907	138909	So it's either Hawaii, Hollywood, Seattle, somewhere in Arizona, I forget what it was.
140189	142330	Can you save it for next year and go to Seattle next year?
142350	143010	By the end of 2009.
143811	146131	And no, I'm not going to PAX next year for that.
146491	148592	I'm not using it for PAX, no.
148872	156235	There's San Antonio, Chicago, Boston, New York City, and Orlando.
156495	157155	Orlando.
157655	158976	So lots of neat places.
159096	160217	Oh, and Hawaii.
160257	161037	You said Hawaii.
161478	163179	Stop rubbing it in.
163579	178029	And then I found out the other day, because this was originally only being offered to our movie sales, we're going to be probably getting a 42-inch Sony Bravia Plasma TV.
178289	178549	Nice.
179250	179910	Through some deal.
180150	184413	Basically, our video reps are selling some Sony product, and the goals seem reasonable.
184493	187175	So probably by Christmas, I'll have another TV.
187655	188836	Let me know when they're hiring, okay?
212000	215623	A pillow shaped like a question block from Mario Bros.
215923	218325	So I have it hanging to my desk just like a question block would be.
218525	221847	They wouldn't let me hang it from the ceiling, so I had to put it under my shelf.
221867	225310	I was going to say, when you get frustrated, would you just go boing?
225790	227611	Well, if I hit it, it knocks it off, but that's fine.
228252	236598	And then I also brought, because I used to do and collect Gundam figures, they had armored core figures, so I picked up one of those and I'm going to build that.
237319	239180	That's kind of cool, but lots of game stuff there.
239440	239800	DarkSakura.com
248018	248818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
275886	280687	It wasn't, because I haven't had a chance to really play much other than Ragnarok.
282147	286888	But I did open my copy of The World Ends With You, and I'm going to be starting it.
287228	290449	So that's some progress, right?
290649	290849	Yes.
291209	294790	Sometimes opening the box can be a day-long chore in itself.
294850	296190	No, no, no.
296250	297370	I played Salamander.
297970	298370	Ah, how was that?
298390	302191	Because I picked up the Salamander pack for Dan on PSP, and it was pretty cool.
302331	302551	Mm-hmm.
303592	304893	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
324033	325634	Lifeforce was still kind of difficult.
326074	328875	I wouldn't say it was our type hard, but it was pretty tough.
328915	333037	Didn't it have a 30 lives code or something, or at least it had the up, up, down, down, like you could get all the power-ups?
333297	333518	Yeah.
333718	333998	Okay.
334358	335238	I think that made it easier.
336459	339140	GS68 wants to know, was it 1 or 2 Salamander?
340541	341421	I got the deluxe pack.
341862	342682	I played the first one.
343122	343762	Ah, there you go.
343802	344883	The both games packs.
346308	347970	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
365848	366728	Thanks for watching!
383154	383754	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
412185	421376	well it stayed like that and so I was invulnerable and any vehicle I got in I was invincible in as well um until I turned the game off um
422330	429397	And then they have a nice glitch with one of the little side missions you can do the bet money on to actually make money off of.
429857	436283	Where they have a maximum where you can only make 5 million per bet.
436383	442269	But the problem is though is the minimum is calculated off of the amount of money that you have.
442509	444471	And the minimum doesn't have a cap to it.
444551	446213	So you can keep playing this game until...
446613	447694	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
470071	471132	And it's kind of boring.
471252	472652	I'm not too far into it.
472712	474493	I'm to the tribe stage right now.
474633	477235	But I haven't really actually played the tribe stage yet.
477275	481337	But the cell and creature stages are quite boring.
482177	484318	And I hope the rest of the game is not like that.
484979	488561	But so far I'm very unimpressed by the graphics.
488601	490322	I'm very unimpressed by the gameplay.
491102	494224	It just looks like a game that should have been out like years ago.
495204	495504	I don't know.
496024	496505	And then...
498078	498920	Rock Band 2.
499341	501846	I was lucky enough to get that a little early.
502407	504471	So I've been playing quite a bit of Rock Band 2.
504571	509101	Actually, we have a fellow worker.
509875	511436	Mad Catz and Awesome in the same sentence?
535407	537250	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
552151	552532	DarkSakura.com
577694	578314	Yeah, exactly.
578374	580035	And they were like the $20 dance pads.
580055	581455	So everybody was like, yay, cheap dance pad.
581495	582676	Well, they would break after like a week.
583276	585197	They were definitely made with $20 parts.
585297	587038	At least with the Rock Band stuff.
587258	590719	And I know that these are officially licensed products.
591199	597602	And Mad Catz is in charge of making the cymbals that are going to be optional for Rock Band 2.
598002	599622	They are the only people that are making them.
600143	603444	And this bass is something that they're starting to put out too.
604244	629799	and it's actually put together a lot better than the controller is the normal guitar controller that you can buy so what makes it kind of unique though they have a thumb rest on it and a dual uh... strummer it's split down the middle so you can kind of um... strum it like you would a bass guitar the only thing i don't like about it and i know you can't really whammy on a bass guitar but the whammy bar is no longer a bar it's a knob and it's literally impossible unless you had a third arm
630339	631559	to trigger it.
631819	636981	I need to interject here because I want to do a quick poll in our chat room because I'm really, really curious about this before you finish this story.
637001	644863	All right, and this is for the longtime music game fans only, of which I know we have many that listen to Orange Lounge Radio because we've been doing this a while when we all started with DDR.
645583	647043	Here's my quick poll question for chat.
647404	653265	Will you find it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz if this bass guitar thing is as awesome as Loki says it is?
653745	654505	That's my quick poll.
654725	656586	Do you have it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz?
657186	667718	I also do have a comment that I don't see what the difference should be in the strum bar or not because I always play the Guitar Hero ones strumming upwards and not downwards because you play bass strumming upwards.
667918	671262	But it's so that you can hit it faster if you want to.
671282	672643	Yeah, I like that it's split in two.
672843	675226	That is kind of cool because you can use like two fingers.
675286	676788	That would take some getting used to.
677448	678770	It does take some getting used to.
679751	681052	I like it though.
681433	682093	It's really good.
682374	686298	I'll read the reviews on it if you have any qualms about buying it.
686879	688841	All the reviews have been extremely positive about it.
689622	691023	Maybe it is a turn for the better.
692825	695467	And then, let's see what else did I play.
695607	697569	Wait, here's the results of our quick poll, alright?
697990	699811	Can you find it in your heart to forgive MadCatz?
699911	702253	Polled at chat.orangeontrader.com Here we go.
702694	707598	Fuck no, no, never ever ever, nope, probably, no, hell no, never.
707918	710941	I'm waiting for Hori to make a guitar con from GS68.
711301	715385	Maybe, perhaps if the price is right, and that's because it has a better D-pad.
715805	717907	I had a MadCatz GameCube controller and it was crap.
718527	720089	There you go, the results of the quick poll.
720993	721254	Okay.
721414	722275	Resoundingly negative.
722455	723757	I'd buy a hoary one.
723958	728184	They're also supposed to be making later on full wood controllers for...
730089	731951	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
752007	755030	It's like rockbanddrumsilencer.com or something like that.
755350	758794	They're really cheap-ass, you know, foam shit.
759154	763698	Well, these are the official ones that they actually sell in the stores for $20, and they work pretty good.
764138	764539	I don't know.
765139	766801	Did you play drums a little bit, Rob?
766981	769764	Yeah, I played drums at your little thing.
769824	772446	Did they work pretty good, the sensitivity on them?
772466	772606	Yeah.
775769	777550	It could have been a little better, honestly.
778010	779451	Some of the pads were better than others.
779511	780572	I noticed the red one.
780832	781693	I had a lot of problems.
782273	784034	Admittedly, it could be the way I drum.
784074	785375	I'm not used to drumming.
785435	786556	I don't claim to drum professionally.
786576	788897	It could also be my drum set because it's a first generation one.
788917	790839	Apparently, all the other ones they've made more sensitive.
791119	792119	I don't know.
792840	794381	I thought it worked pretty well.
794781	795142	I don't know.
795642	799845	It beats being extremely loud with those because it bugs everybody.
799865	800185	True.
800405	803127	The volume is much more manageable with the little
804027	828340	I don't know, I was trying to find the Rock Band 2 drum sets which were supposedly out today and apparently nobody knows that they're supposed to be out today so EA just didn't ship anybody because I went to GameStop which I might add, GameStop told me they were coming out today and they said, oh yeah, we have some coming in for our pre-order customers but we don't know how many extras they're going to have and then I come back to a different GameStop and they're all, what are you talking about?
828440	829561	They're coming out in October.
829961	831702	And I'm a liar!
831722	831802	Yeah.
832768	834509	No, he was an idiot, is what he was.
835210	843637	And I went to the Fry's and they didn't know about it, and Best Buy said they're getting them later in the week, so I'm just assuming they didn't ship anybody, which, not surprising.
847059	851983	But yeah, I need to get some of those new drums, because I want to plug in useless shit to them.
853344	856187	And because my drum set will probably go to my sister eventually, so...
858168	858568	That's it.
858988	860409	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
861229	862169	Alright, my gaming week.
862269	865290	Kind of a lot of the same things that Matt's been talking about, so I don't want to repeat too bad.
865330	866150	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
866250	866870	One more thing.
866890	867551	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
867591	868411	Castle Crashers.
868491	869411	Fucking awesome.
869611	869991	That's it.
870231	870491	Alright.
871652	874893	I've been playing mostly Spore and Rock Band 2 as well.
875453	883415	Although most of my Rock Band 2 was early, early this morning because I went to a Walmart, which I usually don't shop at Walmart, but it was the only place that was doing it at midnight, so I was like, alright, I'll go.
883935	886196	And so I went into Walmart and, you know, just bought it.
886696	889178	I had to wait around because they didn't realize the game was coming out.
889218	893339	But whatever, you know, I guess they're not used to games coming out on Sunday or something.
893399	897101	Although, as Bobby pointed out... They're not used to working at Walmart at midnight.
897901	903084	Well, no, actually, you know, I was going to try to defend them a little bit, you know, be devil's advocate.
903104	907726	But you might be right because I was actually told they can't find the box right now because the guy's on break.
909457	910898	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
939015	957067	and you know it's kind of fun to make a sticker and stuff and the online is much more comprehensive you can do these battle of the bands where you're automatically you know playing against your friends list in a Geometry Wars 2 stylish way of taking over their scores and you know on these set lists that could be up for a week or a few hours it's pretty crazy
959324	975486	so yeah, that's more rounded out online mode but as far as graphics and some of that the interface hasn't really changed at all the models and everything are the exact same ones they had in Rock Band 1 the motion capturing was a lot better though
975906	978548	It didn't even seem that different to me, to be honest.
979749	990957	So it's a little bit Rock Band 1.5-ish to me, but then again, this is kind of where we're going with music games, is it's a Madden all its own now.
991558	998263	I say Rock Band 1.5 in somewhat ingest, because obviously we've been playing DDR for years.
998323	1001325	We're used to this crap, where it's pretty much the same game with new songs.
1001445	1002426	But seriously though, if...
1003186	1009511	The best feature, I think, in this game is actually something that's part of Rock Band 1, which is the song export feature.
1010452	1026045	That, I think, makes it stand out from Guitar Hero easy because now, if it were like DDR, you can take all your songs from the previous mixes and add them in to your next... Rock Band 2, you take all those songs from Rock Band 1.
1026366	1027807	Rock Band 3 is going to have 2 and 1.
1027847	1030869	So you're just going to get this ever-expanding song list and...
1031730	1032551	I think that's pretty cool.
1033251	1034412	Yeah, no, I definitely agree.
1034432	1035093	I think that's cool.
1035113	1045902	I think that's one of the greatest things is just firing up a make-your-own-setlist type thing, and you have literally 150 songs to choose from because you have download songs, rock band one songs, rock band two songs.
1046503	1048264	It's insane, but awesome.
1048665	1056812	And then playing a random setlist or playing online when you have to play random songs, you get songs you forgot you had or songs you didn't know you even had to play, so that's kind of cool.
1058534	1059577	Other games I've been playing this week.
1059637	1060700	Spore, Spore, Spore.
1060741	1062305	I bought Spore and I've been playing that.
1063396	1064416	Thank you for watching!
1090401	1091062	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1109736	1114399	Moving the mouse in random directions, you can get these Picasso-style animals that aren't that bad.
1114479	1117900	But I still feel like I'm crappy at animal design.
1117940	1119721	But that's just something I guess is learned with time.
1119922	1121002	Because I kind of like Loki.
1121042	1129267	You had a creature that has like one ginormous eye, like a scorpion, that showed up in my planet that was actually kind of cool looking.
1129867	1130287	Oh, yeah.
1130307	1133529	It was supposed to be like a dog-looking thing, and the eye was its nose.
1135430	1136430	Because it was black.
1136490	1138872	I called it Spike, and it had like a...
1140055	1148485	My current creature that's like a carnivore that just eats everything, it looks like a velociraptor, but with a giant mouth.
1149546	1153671	But it's like one of those like, hello, my name is George, like type of mouse, like, you know, old.
1157492	1158793	PudgeyGuyMouth
1180263	1185865	So either I see crappy things my friends made, or I can see the cool-looking Maxis ones.
1185885	1188487	I should probably do that, because there's been some really stupid things that came in.
1188627	1190407	How many penis monsters have you seen in sports?
1190427	1190908	Zero.
1191048	1191368	Really?
1192148	1193209	Zero penis monsters.
1193369	1194509	I haven't made one, though, myself.
1194549	1196070	That's pretty impressive.
1196110	1198731	Well, can't you, like, report it or something if it happens?
1198891	1199191	I don't know.
1199411	1199971	See, that's the thing.
1200552	1205974	You have to report it, because I was going to make a planet of penis monsters or something, because that'd be funny.
1207076	1210580	The one other thing I've been playing, I've been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King.
1210600	1211361	I got in the beta.
1212822	1218648	I didn't really read the user end agreement, so I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say about it, although I'm pretty sure most WoW sites have been talking pretty openly about it.
1218668	1220169	I'm going to talk about everything about it.
1221591	1223032	Honestly, what is there to talk about?
1223172	1226115	It's been extremely laggy and very hard to kill things.
1226916	1229038	I was like, ooh, pretty new splash screens.
1229118	1229218	Ooh.
1229358	1230098	Pretty new graphics.
1230138	1231199	I'm on a pretty new continent.
1231899	1234560	But that's about as much as I could see because it was very, very laggy.
1234680	1235641	But it's a beta.
1236061	1237121	It's free for me to play.
1237381	1239562	I can't complain nor base a review off it.
1239642	1240323	So what can you do?
1240683	1241363	I can complain.
1242124	1246745	I'd rather not complain because I realize it's a beta and it's free and it's not the finished product.
1247746	1250047	But all I can say is that it's hard for me to get a feel for it.
1250347	1253228	I will say this though, the new achievement system is kind of interesting.
1253889	1263153	I noticed that now you have to have a Blizzard account and I think that's how it's going to tie to Diablo and StarCraft 2 and the other Blizzard franchises.
1263593	1269855	And the game does pretty much know with some hit and miss accuracy what achievements you've already unlocked.
1270256	1275758	I think it goes through your quest log and figures out what quests you've already done and therefore what achievements you must have beat.
1276078	1277299	But like, my...
1278439	1279480	Thank you for watching!
1301226	1301846	So anyway, that's it.
1301986	1303427	I don't want to drag out Gaming Week too long.
1303467	1304887	We're already like 20 minutes into the show.
1304907	1306228	We got gaming news to get to.
1306788	1310070	I'll really quickly say for housekeeping tonight, there's not an awful lot to say.
1310130	1313371	Just a reminder, I'll be at E4ALL in a couple weeks.
1313411	1318893	Sadly, DarkSakura and Loki will not be joining me, but I'll be there hoping to meet some of you in the LA area that are going to come out for E4ALL.
1318933	1320014	Look at All Games booth.
1320074	1321734	It's supposed to be right out there on the main floor.
1321774	1322915	It's going to be pretty awesome.
1323595	1325716	I'm sure they'll say more about that on AllGames.com.
1325756	1330078	And that is the first weekend in October, the 3rd through the 5th, if I'm not mistaken.
1330398	1330858	I will be there.
1331338	1331678	in LA.
1332959	1338044	Also, if you haven't already, check us out on Twitter at username OLR on Twitter.
1338064	1338624	That's a new one.
1338684	1342487	Or, of course, there's always our Live Journal at Orange Lounge, our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio.
1342867	1344549	And Facebook, our name is the OL Army.
1344789	1348072	That's right, four different sites, four different names, just to confuse you further.
1348712	1351635	All right, let's get into the gaming news for tonight.
1351655	1352596	We'll start off with Loki.
1352956	1354037	What's going on in gaming news?
1354337	1358781	Well, Nintendo has released a new peripheral for the Wii system.
1359802	1360883	No, it's not a hard drive.
1361224	1368610	It's a wireless router because I guess they phased out their little USB sticks that they had to use with your PC.
1368731	1373235	Now this is its own standalone thing and will allow you to connect...
1374716	1385382	to, it's basically, I guess, like an Ethernet bridge, and will allow you to connect your Wii to your router, to your wired network.
1387043	1387383	I don't know.
1387723	1388563	Do we really need this?
1388623	1392045	Is this a replacement for the dongle they had, the USB stick that you had?
1392225	1394186	Rob, you just said one of my favorite funny words.
1394246	1394647	Dongle?
1394847	1395287	Dongle.
1396327	1398429	I'm going to make a spore creature and call it Dongle.
1398449	1398789	Dongle.
1400501	1401944	I'll make one called Balls.
1402385	1403066	Alright, you do that.
1403166	1405772	It's an okay idea, I guess, to have a wireless router.
1407722	1434888	or Wireless Bridge for whatever reason because say you know you want to connect your Wii to your wireless network well the problem is for 53 bucks it costs actually 5800 yen or $53 US which is about the equivalent there for 50 some bucks you could probably get yourself a wireless router and then all of your systems can use it oh and it also works with DS as well I don't know
1435595	1439978	Well, my thought is, what exactly are you going to take your Wii Online for that badly?
1440378	1441499	If you need one of these.
1442119	1444080	To buy more virtual console games, I guess?
1444701	1448143	I mean, are there that many games that support, I guess, Brawl and all that?
1448603	1453406	No, this is just so your Wii can connect to the internet.
1453987	1456228	This is basically a wireless router.
1457109	1461852	But it's Nintendo branded, and it looks like the Wii, sort of.
1462592	1462953	I don't know.
1463113	1464834	I think it's a waste of time, but...
1466224	1467805	There's cheaper solutions out there.
1468525	1472968	Say, for example, this is sitting next to your wired router, your Wii is.
1473008	1480992	They have $20 USB wired dongles that you can get to connect straight to it.
1481232	1481972	It beats paying $53.
1482712	1484433	I don't know.
1485114	1490616	I don't really think this is a problem for a lot of people to connect wirelessly to their network or something.
1490656	1491517	Just buy a new router.
1493107	1495930	Alpha Cananagram in chat says this does allow PCs.
1496650	1498572	It's a router for PCs as well.
1498852	1504717	Well, that's awesome, but once again, I would rather that you bought just a normal router.
1504777	1505658	Buy a Linksys or something.
1505678	1506399	But is it pretty?
1506879	1507880	That's the important question.
1507940	1510823	Linksys are not that pretty white with the blue lights.
1511463	1516868	It's white, and they have a little stand that makes it stand up just like the Wii, but it... I mean...
1518635	1519075	I don't know.
1519556	1522919	I guess this is going to appeal to the same people that like Max.
1523039	1524020	Pretty but useless.
1525021	1525501	Hey, Jamie.
1526502	1526942	Dongle.
1530205	1531966	Who knows?
1532167	1533588	This may never come out over here.
1533748	1540113	Oh, by the way, though, if you are interested in this and you want to get it and you live in Japan, it will be coming out on the 18th.
1542389	1552202	All right, moving on to more hardware, possibly, but not a hard drive, according to Reggie Fils-Aimé, who spoke to the Nintendo magazine Club Nintendo.
1552342	1554866	It's the Latin American magazine translated.
1555467	1556628	Reggie actually said, quote,
1559011	1562553	We have never said that it will be a hard drive, nor have we mentioned how we will fix this issue.
1562914	1565856	We are going to deliver a better way to store the games.
1588390	1589010	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1608135	1615241	Why go the elaborate route when you can just go the easy route and make it so that it'll work with USB hard drives or USB flash drives or something like that?
1615541	1625469	They're going to try to do something stupid like network storage where they'll just basically store the game on their server and you'll have a key and you'll have to download it every time you want to play it or something like that.
1625589	1627191	They're going to do something retarded like this.
1627271	1627651	I know it.
1629032	1630693	Well, here's my thought is that we too
1631714	1635495	They'll release a, you know, just like they've done a DS and a DS Lite, they'll release a Wii 2.
1636015	1637136	They should give us a dongle.
1637376	1640577	The increased storage and possibly a dongle attachment.
1640757	1648299	They need to have a dongle attachment that links to Bluetooth to a separate hard drive.
1648319	1649019	Don't get me wrong.
1649079	1657322	I mean, they've got... They had some innovative ideas when they first put out the Wii, but all ideas since that haven't been that innovative.
1657662	1659683	And actually have been kind of a step backwards.
1659743	1660103	Let's see.
1660143	1660503	We had...
1661383	1663345	Whoa, what are we going to do for shooter games?
1663645	1665646	I know, let's release a plastic shell.
1665766	1667007	What are we going to do for driving games?
1667288	1669189	I know, let's release a plastic shell.
1669269	1670450	What are we going to do for storage?
1671210	1673192	I know, let's do something stupid.
1673993	1675053	I mean, that's what's going to happen.
1675073	1679096	I can just see Reggie at NextE3 coming out to introduce Wii Plus or Wii 2.
1679136	1681998	Look at this, it's holographic storage.
1682099	1685381	With his increased storage space and his massive dongle.
1685661	1686082	Look at this.
1686622	1687563	Come with it.
1687623	1687763	Ah!
1688681	1689201	I can see it now.
1689521	1690482	It's Rob the Robot.
1690522	1694543	He stores your data by stacking blocks or something really retarded.
1694563	1695963	He shoves it all in his dongle.
1696023	1696983	No, no, no.
1697003	1697523	Think about that.
1698064	1702525	Wouldn't that be cool if they made a little USB storage device like Rob the Robot?
1702745	1703265	It won't happen.
1703325	1710167	I always thought they should release a miniature Rob the Robot that plugs into your DS and Game Boy Advance slot.
1712526	1713467	DarkSakura.com
1732742	1735304	That's something that people are familiar nowadays.
1735664	1740968	People aren't like going, oh, it's a mystical device that connects through the internet via magic.
1741109	1743110	I mean, people aren't that dumb.
1743230	1747734	They do have a rudimentary understanding of how computers work.
1748394	1748714	All right.
1749135	1755399	And to be honest, if they don't understand storage and stuff and what kilobytes mean, guess what?
1755699	1760183	Maybe they'll learn to figure out what this is via their Wii.
1760303	1761443	I mean, that's a great idea.
1761504	1763205	Instead, no, we're going to make it.
1764406	1767508	We're just going to pander to the idiots and figure out a way to do that.
1767528	1768308	Thank you, GS68.
1768348	1769689	Wild, wacky action bike.
1769729	1771671	I'm waiting for that attachment to come out on Wii.
1773567	1774588	I'm telling you, man.
1775229	1778130	Whatever it's going to be, I'm just ready for disappointment.
1778150	1780032	We need wild, wacky action bike Wii.
1781993	1783954	It would sell like crazy and you know it.
1786236	1789758	It's seriously, whatever they're going to announce at E3 is just going to be a disappointment.
1790819	1791139	Alright.
1793281	1794622	But we are getting a dongle, right?
1795362	1795982	We might.
1796002	1800986	Seriously, they're going to be like, we've been working on this for years and it's a Nintendo branded SD card.
1801106	1801866	Fuck yourselves.
1802147	1802467	Bye.
1805049	1806069	Well, we'll see what happens.
1806590	1814573	I don't plan on ending my stupid little boycott just yet because most stuff I want that's been coming out on Wii lately, namely the Strong Bad games, have also been coming out on PC.
1814853	1815433	Problem fixed.
1816014	1820235	Well, I'm still going to be downloading Cho Aniki behind my husband's back.
1820715	1822116	Ooh, I like Shaoran's comment.
1822236	1823857	A wild, wacky action dongle.
1824897	1825217	Ooh!
1825337	1826978	That could be like an OLR dream game.
1827118	1829759	And by the way, I was gifted Cho Aniki this week.
1830640	1831600	Someone should gift me.
1831620	1832080	Thank you.
1832500	1832840	Heart.
1833041	1833781	Gift me next.
1835146	1838928	GIFs, I can't break my boycott when people give me GIFs.
1838948	1840889	I forgot to remind you to take the Wii Fit.
1840909	1843810	Oh, that's alright, I'll get it next week or something.
1845050	1845771	More news!
1845831	1852834	Mega Man 9, for everyone who has been happy and excited and getting a little bit flickery giddy about it.
1853734	1855235	It actually has a Japanese release date now.
1857663	1862404	Mega Man 9 is supposed to be out in Japan on September 24th for 1,000 Wii Points.
1862924	1869046	We don't have our date here yet, or in Europe, but Capcom loves us.
1869526	1871166	At least they better, bitches.
1873367	1874827	I'm sure it'll be here soon.
1874867	1876367	No, but seriously, seriously, seriously.
1876847	1884009	It was actually reported, I do believe, by Dengeki Online, the release date, so not too bad.
1885066	1886126	So I'm looking forward to it.
1886507	1889448	I would honestly think that we'd probably get it close to the same day.
1889668	1892729	I was going to say, odds looking good we'll get it around the same day.
1893029	1893490	I hope so.
1894350	1894710	Be nice.
1894990	1895250	Maybe.
1896071	1909356	Well, if you can't wait that long, you'll be happy to know that Strong Bad, Episode 2, Strong Baddie of the Free, will be releasing this Monday on WiiWare and on the PC.
1910597	1911037	Woohoo!
1912674	1920240	and I have no idea what's going to be happening in the game because one, I didn't play the first one and two, I don't really visit the websites.
1920480	1923003	More of the wonderful humor that was in the first game.
1923243	1923603	Of course.
1923623	1924424	It's episode two.
1925224	1927506	It's like you watch a TV series, this is episode two.
1927586	1931089	Like you watch a show like South Park and episode one was funny so you tune into episode two.
1931169	1931770	That's the whole thing.
1932050	1934092	And then things get angsty in episode two.
1934432	1934692	Yes.
1936193	1940297	And, you know, characters start sleeping with each other and form these complex relationships.
1940577	1941458	No, I totally made that up.
1942878	1943939	But that would be interesting.
1944899	1946860	I think even watching too much daytime TV, right?
1947040	1947421	No, it's just 90210.
1948621	1948881	All right.
1950862	1951303	Just kidding.
1952543	1953064	Moving on.
1953104	1954945	Something else is coming out on the Wii quite soon.
1955025	1955885	Wii Music.
1956165	1959948	And, you know, we've had certainly mixed opinions on Wii Music.
1960288	1965190	But sometimes I kind of think that Nintendo does these kinds of things just to kind of impress us.
1965671	1967252	Like try to get a certain niche audience.
1968769	1972931	That's right, you are hearing in the background Cowbell in Wii Music.
1974832	1976993	Wii Music is actually getting Cowbell.
1978054	1979634	And they're actually demoing it there.
1979694	1981835	You can actually check out a little trailer there.
1981875	1984257	It's hit game trailers, but it's also on Nintendo's site.
1985457	1991360	So insert your needs more Cowbell joke here because it's probably what got this in the game.
1991440	1994742	Somebody at Nintendo thought, joke, funny.
1995564	1999806	or that the cowbell is actually considered a real instrument, which in some ways it really is.
2000386	2005568	I actually went to this music store at Haight-Nashbury that has cowbells with features.
2006308	2008989	I'm like, dude, it's a cowbell.
2010090	2013951	Oh, this one's got extra muting and this one has tone change and this one's got this.
2014311	2015512	I'm like, dude, it's a cowbell.
2016112	2017893	You bang it with a stick.
2018853	2019874	I know, electric cowbell.
2019894	2020554	That would be awesome.
2021900	2022881	Amplified Cowbell.
2025963	2028084	Like a cowbell that sounds like a gong every time you hit it.
2028224	2030045	A cowbell doesn't vibrate like that.
2030325	2032166	Do you get to play gong in Wii Music?
2032487	2033567	That would be kind of awesome.
2034048	2035989	No, but I will gong in Wii Music.
2038490	2038831	Alright.
2039291	2041772	Wii Music is getting more cowbell.
2041792	2042093	There you go.
2043166	2046149	All the others that are already there.
2064944	2065465	Isn't that nice?
2065985	2068506	It's wonderful news because Castlevania 3 is one of the best.
2068827	2073630	One thing I hope, that it's like the Japanese version.
2073910	2078213	I somehow knew you were going to go there and get into the whole discussion about the extra sound or whatever.
2078293	2080634	No, that wasn't it.
2080694	2084197	When you played Grant, you know the one who climbs on the ceiling and everything?
2084217	2086478	Hell yeah, how can you forget Grant if you've ever played Castlevania 3?
2086938	2088920	He throws his knife instead of just stabs.
2089680	2090861	So he actually has a ranged attack.
2091101	2092061	Oh, so he's actually useful.
2092242	2092462	Yes.
2092862	2093282	Oh, nice.
2093382	2095663	Because I always used the one that had the fire, ice.
2096183	2096563	Sypha?
2096823	2097064	Yeah.
2097264	2101345	But what's the point in him throwing knives if he can have a sub-weapon of throwing knives?
2102246	2103806	I don't think he can.
2104367	2106107	Wasn't there something else, too, with Castlevania?
2106247	2108808	And it's that the Famicom since it had an extra sound.
2108848	2110449	Didn't it have an extra sound processor or something?
2110469	2111309	I think it did.
2111449	2114531	I think if I'm correct, it ran off the disc.
2117173	2122758	and the disc system did actually have... Like, have you ever heard the Legend of Zelda for the Famicom disc?
2122818	2125640	It had actually really nice music in it.
2125900	2127742	So it was the difference in the sound processors too.
2127762	2133027	Little known fact, the Famicom disc system had a sound channel for porno soundtracks.
2134108	2134308	What?
2135444	2135704	True.
2136505	2136605	False.
2136685	2137185	Absolutely true.
2137806	2138026	What?
2138106	2138326	Really?
2138386	2139007	I wouldn't lie.
2139447	2139988	Yes, you would.
2140008	2140848	Absolutely true.
2140888	2145011	GameGuru in chat says, JP will get JP version, US will get US version.
2145432	2146112	Sad but true.
2148134	2157922	Or if it's easier to not emulate off the disk system, because I don't think there have been any disk games that have come to Virtual Console, maybe JP will get US version.
2158202	2159483	No, it's going to be the US version.
2159503	2160363	We got Excitebike, didn't we?
2162130	2163131	Oh, that's true, we did.
2163151	2167052	No, but Excitebyte wasn't the disc version.
2167072	2168273	What did they do with the save load?
2168373	2173255	Even here in America, though, remember we got the cartridge and it still had save load and it would just crash your game if you tried to use it?
2173895	2173975	Yeah.
2173995	2179958	Which I thought was one of the most hilarious things ever on the old school Nintendo, that they just left it in there when we didn't have the attachment.
2180498	2183580	Well, if I was right, the entire game was done in English anyway.
2183600	2184220	Hmm.
2185576	2193138	If only Nintendo knew they were setting trends with Excitebike that soon will be followed by large companies like EA.
2193798	2195239	Releasing games that are broken.
2195619	2197099	Awesome.
2197119	2200160	DriverMite also had it, if I'm right.
2200180	2210062	But no, it didn't because DriverMite was the one that my husband and I went through like 15 copies of when he had his used game store and took out the converter cartridge so that we could make our own converter.
2210603	2211183	Oh, nice.
2211863	2212103	Yeah.
2213427	2216058	Wow, there were actually that many copies of Gyromite in circulation?
2216138	2217524	That many Rob the Robot sold?
2218760	2219640	My friend had one.
2219700	2221081	I knew one friend that had one.
2221141	2221541	We have one.
2222241	2223321	What did they really do?
2223461	2223941	Like, nothing.
2223961	2224661	They had the little spinny thing.
2224681	2225261	It was a selling point.
2225281	2225741	That's it.
2226382	2227362	It didn't do anything.
2227482	2231783	You can play three games with this thing, and he's going to look cool, and then that's it.
2231883	2232963	He looks like Johnny Five.
2233463	2236804	I mean, a lot of people don't really understand what Rob the Robot actually did.
2236984	2246926	Like, basically, didn't he just, like, he had these little spinning discs that you would put down, like these little top things that you would put down on these giant things that just pressed your controller.
2247446	2248046	Pretty much!
2249647	2250908	Rob, it was a selling point.
2251108	2253590	It was amazingly stupid in retrospect.
2253630	2261914	And I realize that Rob the Robot is like pop culture cool, and everybody laughed when they saw him in Brawl, but if you think about it, Rob the Robot was really stupid.
2263195	2264956	Like, in all actuality.
2266117	2266577	But anyhow.
2267982	2269243	Rob the Robot just exudes awesome.
2269283	2270383	That's what Rob the Robot does.
2294130	2295552	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2307490	2323101	Um, anyways, on PC this week, we've got Stalker, Clear Sky, uh, Cabela's Big Game Hunter 09, Legendary Adventures, and, uh, that's also coming out on the PlayStation 2 Wii, and I believe that's it.
2323821	2325422	Uh, let's see here.
2325943	2329465	Star Wars The Force Unleashed will be coming out on pretty much every system out there.
2329485	2335229	Um, not any retro systems, all current systems, and...
2337715	2343339	Drun Life, Spongebob Squarepants Edition TNA Impact Crisis Warhead on PC
2361300	2361700	I don't know.
2362380	2363881	It's meant for lower end PCs.
2364742	2367523	The Witcher Enhanced Edition on PC.
2368223	2370804	We have Hell's Kitchen coming out on PC this week.
2372565	2376066	Armored Core for Answer on PS3 and Xbox 360.
2376987	2379748	We have Igor coming out on PC, DS, and the Wii.
2380948	2384230	Line Rider 2 Unbound on PC and DS.
2385190	2388292	Dance Dance Revolution X on PlayStation 2.
2389818	2412843	Enchanted Unicorn on PC, Kid Sports Crazy Golf on Wii, Bratz Ponies 2 on DS, Dragon Quest IV Chapters of the Chosen on DS, Battle of Phantasia on 360, My Secret World by Imagine, and it's a diary.
2418900	2428784	Pure on PS3, 360, and PC Super Pickups on the Wii Unsolved Crimes on the DS
2430590	2431631	Zoo Hospital on the Wii.
2431651	2434773	Apparently it's like Trauma Center meets a pet hospital.
2434873	2436293	It's kind of neat.
2436334	2440116	Red Bull BC One, that game I've been talking about for a while now.
2440616	2441637	Check it out, it's on the DS.
2442837	2448741	And let's see, there's some collections, retro collections coming out from Namco.
2448761	2451262	They have the Naruto Ultimate Collection, which is...
2452583	2467337	Naruto The Ultimate Ninja 2 and 3 and Uzumaki Chronicles and then the Namco Classic Fighter Collection which is Soul Calibur 2, Tekken 5 and... God, I can't remember the last one.
2468017	2470219	And then Pac-Man Power Pack which is a bunch of Pac-Man games.
2471561	2472541	Nothing good, unfortunately.
2474123	2476145	And I think that's all the big stuff, at least.
2478513	2478873	All right.
2479334	2480335	Yeah, any price point?
2480375	2482817	I know a lot of our listeners are probably into DDRX.
2483697	2485058	Any price point for that?
2485238	2488861	I want to say it's $40 for the game only, and for the bundle, it's probably $49.99.
2489762	2495947	I would have thought maybe it came down a little bit in price, because PS2 is kind of, you know, the last... It may have.
2496167	2498309	I'm just going off memory, and that's, you know...
2499049	2500671	All right, so don't take that as the final word.
2501311	2502532	Here, give me one second.
2502572	2503053	I can tell you.
2503073	2505895	Well, let me do the Japanese release dates, and you can kind of jump in whenever you find it.
2506556	2515524	Going over to the Japanese release dates, Star Wars The Force Unleashed is coming to the Asian regions around Japan and on all those other consoles as well.
2515564	2523431	As far as Japan, Japan itself is getting Unreal Tournament 3 on the Xbox 360 this week on the 18th for those folks that like the first-person shooters over there.
2524191	2527333	I know the scene's not quite as big over there, but they've got some fans of it.
2528033	2532376	Some PlayStation 3 games getting a price reduction this week, including Def Jam Icon and Fight Night Round 3.
2532676	2537299	Again, those are price reductions on the PlayStation 3, down to about $30 US.
2539540	2542301	Some other games coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 3, G.I.
2542381	2548564	Jockey 4 2008, and Winning Post 7 in a combo pack, or of course you can just get the game G.I.
2548584	2549504	Jockey 4 by itself.
2550244	2558347	Also, Trusty Bell, Chopin No Yume, you might know this here as Eternal Sonata, finally comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
2559148	2560388	It's $29.99 for the game only.
2560588	2561109	Ah, much better.
2561469	2561609	Good.
2562769	2566671	Unreal Tournament 3 also comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week, so be on the lookout for that.
2567732	2574676	Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo Wii, we have Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles getting a price reduction.
2574696	2576277	You know that, of course, is Resident Evil.
2577538	2577838	G.I.
2577878	2579679	Jockey Wii 2008 as well.
2580199	2581640	Kororimpa gets a price reduction.
2582040	2585202	Bomberman comes out next week, so be on the lookout for that.
2585242	2587403	That's actually on next week's list on the 25th.
2589025	2590767	Moving on to the PlayStation 2.
2592068	2593750	PlayStation 2 is still getting a lot of love.
2594771	2600458	Hyper Street Fighter 2, the Anniversary Edition, and Vampire Darkstalkers Collection Value Pack.
2601078	2607846	So for you old school 2D Capcom fighting fans, a little PS2 pack coming out for you guys.
2608046	2609028	That's happiness.
2609828	2610129	G.I.
2610169	2617637	Jockey 4, 2008, also gets a version on PlayStation 2 and gets a combo pack with Winning Post 7, also on PlayStation 2.
2618198	2623584	And a game called Heart No Kuni No Alice is coming out as well on the PlayStation 2.
2623925	2628090	Let's take a look at the handheld systems, starting off on the Nintendo DS.
2629699	2633063	DragonBallDS comes out this week from NamcoBandai.
2634185	2636668	LumiSlight, HikariNoPuzzle as well.
2637108	2640312	LongVacation, IrukaTotoWatashi comes out.
2640853	2647601	And OshishiKeiji, Keiji-san Watashi ga Arimashita comes out from Success.com.
2649861	2652582	And we'll see if it will be a success over in Japan.
2652762	2653483	Although probably not.
2653503	2654083	I've never heard of it.
2654703	2660286	On the Sony PlayStation Portable, Monster Hunter Portable, 2ndG Hunter, Leather Cover.
2660866	2661827	So that's not a game.
2661867	2666869	It's just something to match all the Monster Hunter games that you have for your PlayStation Portable.
2666889	2670791	But if you actually want a new game, you can get Samurai Do Portable.
2671448	2672309	is the name of that game.
2672949	2676652	And I'm not sure if that's a fighting game or what type of game that is.
2676772	2679214	It looks to be an action-based game.
2679415	2680536	I don't think it's a fighting game, though.
2680556	2682857	I think it's a hack-and-slash type PSP game.
2683698	2688102	It's rated 15+, or 0C, so you know there's going to be some good blood.
2688702	2689123	Hooray!
2689203	2689543	Blood!
2689663	2689963	Gore!
2690504	2691765	That's it for your Japanese release dates.
2692772	2696495	For UK, we have the 18th Warhammer Online.
2696996	2698397	For the 19th is everything else.
2698997	2717312	Destroy All Humans, Path of Furon, Hell's Kitchen, the video game, Play TV for PlayStation 3, SimCity Creator, Star Wars The Force Unleashed, also STCC, the game, The Witcher Enhanced Edition, and Tim Stockdale's Riding Star.
2718032	2719574	Oh, and also Yakuza 2.
2722918	2723258	That's it?
2723418	2723778	That's it.
2724639	2727260	You know, The Force Unleashed, we all mentioned that in our respective releases.
2727320	2730501	It's practically a worldwide release this week.
2730541	2737004	But one thing that's kind of interesting about it, one thing I was reading about on the internet, I was trying to see if GameStop was doing a Rock Band 2 midnight release.
2737284	2740505	Because I really just didn't want to go to Walmart, but it was pretty much the only thing that was open.
2740545	2741726	And yes, I had to have the game at 12.01.
2742626	2743747	even though I didn't get it until 1230.
2744047	2754452	But anyway, apparently the reason why GameStop did not do a midnight release for Rock Band 2 is because a lot of them are doing midnight releases for Forced Unleash and they just didn't want to pay all that extra salary.
2754692	2764357	A lot of people, I mean, I would see why they're doing that because the Forced Unleash is coming out on a lot more systems and a lot of people might not be interested in the game-only version of Rock Band.
2764617	2766938	And there's a lot of rabid Star Wars fans.
2767198	2767639	I mean, really.
2768079	2770300	So, I mean, I can understand why they would do that.
2772256	2800465	VXJasonXV played Hell's Kitchen the game in our chat room and he laughs ha ha ha and said I played Fox's Flash version of that it was silly yeah and you know what's funny is that Flash version of it is pretty much what you're getting on the Wii and the DS it's crap so Frisbee says bake that fucking bread now sadly I don't think the Wii version of the game will swear at you which is the only reason to watch Hell's Kitchen I don't get it like if you're not going to get berated by your Nintendo Wii what's the point
2801618	2804200	Now you're just playing like Cake Mania with some fire.
2805201	2808865	It's basically just like Cooking Mama mixed with American Idol.
2809775	2812617	Rock Band 2 People that managed to get their copies early were welcomed with custom screens
2832611	2833612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2854130	2868362	And then, of course, for those people that have finally picked up their copy, you'll be greeted with some new tracks to download this Tuesday, including the Megadeth album, Peace Sells, but who's buying?
2869142	2873045	And they've got, it looks like, about, I want to say...
2874613	2891435	7 songs available there for $2 each or you can buy the whole pack for $11 so you save a few bucks there remember back in the day when like 8 marathon songs was an album like you know you'd get 8 songs from a rock band but they would be just like effing epic rock songs like 7-8 minutes in length
2892536	2893016	Megadeth.
2893416	2893776	Awesome.
2893917	2895117	Megadeth was awesome.
2895437	2911322	And then also, if that's not your cup of tea, they have the Rock Band Tour Pack, which includes one of those nights by The Cab, Hands Down by Dashboard Confessional, She's a Handsome Woman by Panic at the Disco, and Natural Disaster by Plain White Teas.
2911822	2916864	All those are available for a buck or 80 Microsoft points, or you can buy the whole pack for $4.
2917464	2919224	So you're saving zero money.
2920045	2920265	Nice.
2923084	2927167	By the way, speaking of Rock Band download stuff, I know our one and only DarkSakura.
2927307	2934091	One thing she loves almost more than video games is gorillas, and therefore Blur, because, you know, the whole Damon-Auburn connection.
2934232	2934812	I know!
2935512	2938675	I did check out Beetlebum, which is available in the Rock Band store.
2938735	2940376	It is a cover, if you weren't already aware.
2940736	2941276	It's not horrible.
2941297	2942397	It's not worth having.
2942477	2943258	It's not horrible.
2943858	2949302	At least you have the song, because, you know, ideally you're supposed to get someone else to sing to it anyway, but it is a cover.
2949502	2950383	If you didn't know on it, already know.
2951496	2957318	If you do sing it, you have to do the really extra thick accent that he affects for the song.
2957438	2957878	Exactly.
2958278	2964460	And I realize this is like the quintessential Blur song, but we have to have song two come out at some point.
2964500	2965260	I mean, come on.
2965400	2969001	Either that or There's No Other Way.
2970181	2971021	Or Boys and Girls.
2971061	2972702	I like that song.
2972722	2973262	My favorite is.
2974262	2975202	I like Coffee and TV too.
2975663	2976343	That's a good song.
2976963	2977203	Anyhow.
2978186	2983393	But they probably aren't going to have anything off of the later two Blur albums because they're very kind of melodramatic.
2983413	2984114	At least in this country.
2984134	2986578	This weren't as big here.
2987199	2989482	13 was a weird album.
2989522	2990103	Anyhow, sorry.
2990564	2991525	Enough Blur dish.
2992426	2994089	By the way, I love the fact...
2994269	2996170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3021132	3026896	So, I thought it was funny that everybody's afraid to go online, like they're going to get busted and banned or something.
3027857	3030419	And Harmonix really didn't seem to give a crap.
3030799	3037424	We were playing that last night, and some of the vocal sections in the game were kind of easy to hit.
3037444	3038365	I remember, was it...
3039065	3042026	Jim Sabotage, right?
3042046	3053770	Not sabotage, what you want He was just like He's like drunk That's what he was literally saying He was just kind of yelling He was like, awesome!
3053790	3067735	I don't know, I thought that was funny And then Irene If you've listened to this show long enough You know Rice Princess was making up new lyrics And saying something about my butt To all these songs Which was very rude, in my opinion Very rude
3069693	3073076	Anyhow, thank God there was no video camera there so it can be on YouTube.
3089850	3094692	Well, not only do you already know about the bundle, but now you know exactly what songs you're going to be getting in the game.
3095173	3096693	I'm not going to read the entire song list.
3096713	3099214	You can probably just Google Guitar Hero World Tour song list.
3099234	3100095	You'll find the whole thing.
3100375	3103356	But I do want to point out some highlights of the song list, at least in my mind.
3103396	3104517	I'm sure everybody feels differently.
3105657	3110800	311, Beautiful Disaster, Beastie Boys, No Sleep Till Brooklyn, Billy Idol, Rebel Yell,
3111760	3129872	Blink-182, Damn It, Blondie, One Way or Another Bon Jovi, Livin' on a Prayer Coldplay, Shiver The Doors, Love Me Two Times The Eagles, Hotel California Filter, Hey Man, Nice Shot Fleetwood Mac, Go Your Own Way Foo Fighters, Everlong Guess Who, American Woman
3139078	3143701	Jimmy Hendrix, Purple Haze, and The Wind Cries Mary Corn with Freak on a Leash Lenny Kravitz, Sweet Home Alabama Live
3162193	3186294	Metallica, Trapped Under Ice, Michael Jackson, Mews with Assassin, Nirvana with the unplugged version of About a Girl, No Doubt with Spiderwebs, NoFX, Ozzy Osbourne with Crazy Train, Pat Benatar, Heartbreaker, R.E.M.,
3187755	3190936	Smashing Pumpkins, Survivor, Eye of the Tiger, Sublime, Tool, 3 Songs by Tool,
3206044	3208006	I like Tool.
3208366	3211689	Parabola, Schism, and Vicarious.
3211949	3212370	Schism.
3212670	3213431	I don't listen to Tool.
3213471	3214472	I don't like them, actually.
3214712	3216494	But that's just... Well, whatever.
3218235	3219797	Van Halen, Hot for Teacher.
3220798	3223700	That was a song that got played over and over again at Penny Arcade Expo.
3224981	3226323	And Wings with Band on the Run.
3228004	3229666	Because you know we needed some Wings in Guitar Hero.
3230998	3234680	Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar Hero World Tour
3242661	3245364	I wish they would have more songs like Beat It and stuff like that.
3245704	3246725	Yeah, I know.
3246765	3249488	We need a pop band or a pop hero or something.
3249508	3251890	Not even necessarily have to do that, but some download packs.
3251950	3257915	I don't understand why there isn't more Michael Jackson stuff in there because Beat It works and you might even be able to do Thriller and stuff.
3257955	3260738	Just stuff that had a lot of guitar and stuff in the background.
3261479	3263941	Dude, Thriller needs to be download content.
3264041	3264701	Make it happen.
3265422	3266022	Lovely folks.
3266202	3267923	And also country stuff.
3268303	3271465	There's that one song, Rockstar, that would work pretty well.
3272185	3274066	I'm just surprised there's not a lot of that stuff.
3274666	3279668	It may not be enough for its own game, but at least throw some download content out there.
3279688	3285191	I'm sure people would appreciate appealing to a broader audience, I guess.
3286951	3287752	Alright, well there you have it.
3287772	3293054	The Guitar Hero World Tour set list and a lot of guitar fans very excited about this game.
3294533	3297395	and other exciting news.
3298736	3300897	Actually, I think it's pretty cool.
3301858	3303499	Rob, do you ever watch Comedy Central?
3303979	3304319	Of course.
3304379	3305140	I love Comedy Central.
3305160	3306040	That's where I get South Park.
3306100	3307841	What's your favorite show besides South Park?
3308001	3309542	My favorite show besides South Park?
3309702	3310243	The Daily Show.
3311149	3311750	The Colbert Report
3327651	3333212	Yes, Charlene is going to be available as a free download for Rock Band.
3333712	3335733	So everyone has to go get it right now.
3336133	3337433	Yes, it is actually available now.
3337813	3338033	Yes.
3338253	3339914	But it's one of those blink and you miss it things.
3340454	3340774	Get it!
3341074	3343935	Yeah, because if you go into Rock Band, you won't see it in the new releases.
3344355	3345475	It's only in the library.
3345995	3354897	And if anyone wants to familiarize themselves with it, while they already should be, except that I'm not really all that familiar with it, you can actually watch the video on YouTube as well.
3357379	3358881	Go watch it after the show.
3359461	3362845	The song's only like a minute long and it's not that difficult either.
3362885	3365188	I've heard people are getting their achievements with it.
3367571	3368932	The lyrics are very funny.
3370234	3373237	It enables the players to achieve more.
3374018	3375981	Actually, we can play a little clip from Charlene.
3376001	3376982	It's only like a minute long.
3379138	3380699	I love the synthesizer in this song.
3403486	3406047	Aw, nice.
3406087	3406987	Reminds me of my ex.
3407428	3407728	Alright.
3408828	3410229	Oh my god, that's so wrong.
3410249	3411489	There you have it.
3411509	3412729	That's so wrong.
3412749	3413450	Oh my god.
3414630	3416591	There'll be a couple people listening to the show that understand that.
3416651	3418291	Alright, let's move on quickly.
3418632	3426915	Anyway, speaking of appealing to a broader audience, SingStar is releasing a country version which will be coming to the PlayStation 2 on October 28th.
3426935	3427315	And you can find...
3431738	3442503	I guess songs from Kelly Pickler, Keith Urban, Montgomery Gentry, and among others.
3443463	3445264	Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
3445644	3451767	Also, they're going to be localizing SingStar Legends as well, which is supposed to be coming out the same day.
3452647	3455309	That has a bunch of pop legend stuff.
3455549	3460111	You can probably guess all your favorite stuff.
3461089	3461810	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3477895	3479335	How dare you, Loki?
3479675	3488057	How dare you talk about SingStar and not talk about the most important announcement of all time?
3488217	3495718	This is the greatest moment in video game history happened this week around SingStar, and Loki just somehow missed it.
3495938	3497939	It's a decider who wins the console war, right?
3497999	3503920	The console war has been won this week by Sony PlayStation 3, and it's all because...
3506804	3507745	Waterloo
3539626	3542007	This was one of those moments and then God spoke.
3542727	3544168	And he said, let there be Abba.
3544568	3545129	And there was.
3545709	3546629	And Sony won the war.
3547550	3547990	There it is.
3550331	3554633	I mean, let's just end the fucking show because there's no other news that's going to top this.
3554773	3555774	Does that mean we can go home now?
3555834	3558455	I mean, we could try, but it's just going to be pathetic.
3560056	3561457	Well, I don't know.
3561497	3563998	I still think that my story was the best story ever.
3564609	3565730	Well, Stephen Colbert is pretty cool.
3565750	3566390	We'll try, Rob.
3566550	3567531	Try to find something fun.
3567651	3568691	I will find something fun.
3568731	3569912	Let's talk about DJ Hero.
3569932	3574654	There's a lot of people that are very excited about DJ Hero because they think it's going to be Beatmania 2DX.
3574734	3580277	It's going to be like, you know, the answer to Beatmania 2DX by the folks who did Guitar Hero.
3580677	3586260	Well, you'd be kind of like half right because it's not really going to be like...
3587320	3587780	Beatmania 2DX
3606668	3612514	So if you imagine one of these things, you could hit this little turntable and there's actually going to be little effector buttons on it.
3613034	3615076	It's like a version of one of those type of decks.
3615116	3619441	You use these little effector buttons and a crossfader to actually drop samples.
3619841	3626608	So if you ever thought like, hey, Beatmania isn't really like DJing, now you have a game that is actually kind of DJing.
3627048	3628469	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3652328	3652989	Let's see here.
3653309	3661815	If we take the scratch and replace it with strum and we turn the effector buttons into fret buttons, we have Guitar Hero.
3662455	3666278	So really, it's just re-skinning Guitar Hero to put different music in it.
3666318	3667519	But in a way, think about this.
3667539	3668299	This does sound kind of cool.
3668319	3672022	They say the wireless controller apparently is actually grooved to fit in your lap.
3672202	3672982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3696127	3698129	The Grey Album was Jay-Z and the Beatles.
3698249	3698669	Oh, never mind.
3698689	3699189	Sorry, Jay-Z.
3699209	3700871	Because I'm thinking Metallica's Black Album.
3700891	3702792	I know it was like a black album mixed with a white album.
3703973	3706395	But think those types of things.
3706455	3708997	It's supposed to be mashups.
3709017	3710097	This is going to be the whole song list.
3710117	3711398	You like mashups, don't you, Loki?
3711819	3712880	I thought you loved that kind of stuff.
3713120	3713520	I don't know.
3713720	3716762	I think this game is going to be... People will probably buy it because it's...
3717623	3726189	Yeah, something that Activision is putting out, but I think it's going to be, if you're thinking it's going to be 2DX, you're going to be sorely disappointed.
3727110	3727930	Well, we'll see what happens.
3727950	3730512	No, it's not going to be 2DX, but it sounds like it could be cool.
3731653	3735795	I don't necessarily need a copy of a game that's already out there and still selling in Japan, you know what I mean?
3736596	3738057	I like the fact that it's kind of different.
3739316	3768348	and they're also saying that they're supposed to be like guitar co-op as well I don't know it's we'll have to see how it actually plays out but I'm not too optimistic yet what's interesting and possibly related is that almost within the same breath Activision announced this week that they have acquired Freestyle Games it's a UK based developer and they made the game B-Boy which you know was on the PSP I don't think it really sold like crazy but it was a rhythm action game that was available on the PSP and it's apparently what they're doing is they're developing a new music based IP
3769363	3770103	Hmm.
3771184	3771904	B-Boy?
3773084	3774025	DJ Hero?
3774525	3775205	Connection?
3775885	3776426	Who knows?
3776926	3782528	But it certainly is interesting that Freestyle Games was sucked into the Activision collective this week.
3782888	3783368	So there you go.
3783809	3785249	People will eat this up.
3786189	3798094	As long as you do something innovative with it, you know, if you can mix actual MP3s or something like that, that might be kind of cool, but somehow I'm gonna set the bar a lot lower than, you know,
3798837	3799638	I would like it to be.
3799978	3802680	By the way, B-Boy was not just available on the PlayStation Portable.
3802700	3804882	It is available on the PlayStation 2, also in the United States.
3804902	3806983	Yeah, it got released here a couple weeks ago.
3807264	3809886	But it was probably one of those, again, kind of blink and you miss it sort of things.
3809926	3810826	It was an alright game.
3811066	3811387	Was it?
3811527	3812007	I haven't played it.
3812027	3812628	It was okay.
3812788	3813568	I had never even heard of it.
3813588	3814809	That's why I say blink and miss it.
3814829	3819233	I played the UK version of the PSP game a while back, and it was alright.
3819273	3822195	It wasn't a lot to hold my attention for a long time, but it was pretty cool.
3822795	3823356	Alright, fair enough.
3824795	3825836	Alright, well, there you have it.
3826156	3827798	We'll see more information on DJ Hero.
3827838	3828939	Maybe made by these guys.
3828959	3829239	We'll see.
3830280	3832442	Well, Sony is not happy.
3833303	3834864	Not happy at all.
3834924	3835685	They should be elated.
3835725	3836286	They have ABBA.
3837006	3839809	Yeah, but the PSP people aren't happy.
3840449	3841410	They want it all.
3841611	3844513	And I mean, as if ABBA wasn't big enough, they want everything.
3844553	3846575	They want third-party support for the PSP.
3847336	3848577	They're not very happy with it.
3850271	3868523	Basically, the boss of Sony Worldwide Studios, Yoshida Shuhei, is basically saying that they'd like to see more third-party support on the PSP and that they're jealous because other people are getting third-party support and not them.
3869344	3871525	He's quoted saying it's really, really disappointing.
3871725	3873847	I mean, it's so disappointing he had to use really twice.
3875067	3875308	What?
3876148	3877169	It did get the point across.
3877569	3898624	and it's a lost opportunity for the third parties they should look at what the PSP can do for their titles and the potential for the business that their IP has they say though that Sony's got a whole bunch more things ready but they are really wanting Capcom maybe but you know the PSP 3000
3900385	3901165	is on its way!
3920320	3921262	Not even that.
3921342	3922503	I wouldn't even go that far.
3922623	3931054	It's just there's a lot more people that own the DS because they're suckered into buying multiple colors for it or God knows what.
3932421	3941924	I don't know, I like the PSP a lot better than the DS, but I... Well, but if you go back to that rule that a system is only as good as the games that are on it... Exactly, there's better games on DS in general, so people are going to go where the good games are.
3942084	3947266	And in a way, this is what Sony's complaining about, is that the third parties aren't giving them what they need to sustain.
3947746	3950167	Well, maybe start supporting the third parties a little bit more.
3950227	3955769	Maybe do some innovative features to the PSP, like make voice chat a lot easier.
3955889	3958530	Now that they have the microphone built in, they can do some stuff with that.
3959517	3961017	Touchscreen, that might be kind of cool.
3961858	3962618	Tilt sensors.
3964939	3970120	I always kind of thought that the PSP's strength over the DS was that it was more of a kind of all-in-one type system.
3970160	3973281	It was like part iPod, part game player, part web browser.
3973321	3976422	It's just a little bit of everything for a relatively low price.
3976482	3981384	For me, I have absolutely no reason to really play a PSP much except for a couple of games, really.
3982085	3985626	If I was in high school, though, all over again, I would be all over this PSP.
3985926	3988027	I mean, this would be a great thing to take to high school, I think.
3988147	3989347	Because you got it all right there.
3990307	3992408	When I was in high school, it was the Atari Lynx.
3993888	3994668	Wow, if that.
3994988	3995749	I didn't have one of those.
3996069	3997209	I had a Game Boy Brick.
3997229	3998549	Actually, it was the Turbo Express.
3998949	4002850	I had a Game Boy Brick in a brick gray case.
4003451	4004651	I hauled it around and it got stolen.
4005371	4008992	I had a Game Boy Brick and a friend of mine had a Turbo Express.
4010330	4011631	I was like, cool, I want one.
4012111	4012431	But anyway.
4014312	4026658	Well, there's some other good things, though, coming to the PSP, and I know we don't talk about it too much, but they actually have a lot of games now on their PC store that you can download the full versions of.
4026718	4030939	It's almost like a digital version of it, kind of like what they do with the PS1 Classics.
4032200	4034481	Included, you know, this new lineup of stuff.
4034501	4035221	They're going to have Cube...
4036942	4040503	Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords for $14.99, which is not bad.
4040563	4041503	Work Time Fun for $10.
4041643	4047604	You get PQ, PQ2, that one game that's kind of like IQ.
4048064	4054565	The first one for $9.99, the second one for $14.99, and Deadhead Fred, which is kind of a sleeper game for $15.
4055785	4059186	So they are releasing quite a bit of stuff on the PC store.
4059766	4064447	I kind of think it's funny, though, that they have digital copies of it now, because, I mean...
4065865	4069393	People have been doing that before in not such a legit way.
4070255	4071096	But now they're encouraging it.
4072421	4089093	And by the way, if you're listening to this show on a PSP, which a lot of our emailers and so on have told us that they do, you need to pause the podcast right now and you need to go to olrpsp.com in your browser and check out the new Orange Lounge Radio All Games Tuner that's available on the downloads page there because it's quite awesome.
4089573	4095317	And it will allow you to listen to the All Games Radio live feed right there from your crossbar without having to hunt around for it.
4095897	4097959	It's like one-click access to the show, which is great.
4098379	4099340	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4118516	4119357	Hmm, interesting.
4119397	4119737	We'll see.
4120998	4122439	All right, let's see.
4123059	4125461	Moving on to another Sony-related story.
4125621	4128263	And this is the type of game a lot of folks can get into.
4128343	4129224	It's Kingdom Hearts.
4129664	4133507	And a lot of people have kind of been wondering, when's the next Kingdom Hearts game going to come out?
4133547	4135068	Where's our information on Kingdom Hearts 3?
4135428	4136649	Well, sadly, we don't have that.
4137089	4142731	But what we did get from this week's GameStop Expo, which is kind of a meeting of all the important people at GameStop, happened this week.
4142791	4146672	Apparently, a little piece slipped out about Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.
4147112	4154975	You might remember that this was a Game Boy Advance game that got released on the PlayStation 2 in Japan as part of a Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix type thing that came out.
4154995	4158996	It was like a bonus disc, and it kind of was forgotten about and never was released over here.
4159656	4165038	Until now, apparently, Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, it is going to be coming to the U.S.,
4166158	4170379	There was a small mention of Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories at Square Enix's presentation.
4171220	4176061	When they were asked if it was the same one that was Final Mix 2 in Japan, they did confirm it with a nod.
4176101	4180142	There hasn't been an official announcement through Square, just this small mention.
4180202	4182983	So I guess you should take it with a little bit of a grain of salt.
4183303	4188245	But apparently, if you tie things together, back in July, Squeenix was hiring an English voice cast.
4188585	4190826	So probably to go for this game.
4191186	4194507	Although that could also be for Final Fantasy 13, but who knows.
4196519	4198702	I would think, why not release this game here?
4198762	4200665	I mean, certainly there's an audience for it.
4202687	4205712	But, you know, they usually don't pay attention to everybody, do they?
4206273	4207454	Well, who knows?
4208351	4209791	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4237918	4240659	The classic game of the week came out on Super Nintendo.
4241159	4245360	It is one of the Mario franchises, and it is Mario Paint.
4246860	4247200	Awesome.
4247800	4256262	Mario Paint uses the SNES mouse that came with it, and it basically is a little drawing program for the most part.
4256442	4266844	I mean, it basically is like Microsoft Paint, but I don't really want to go too much into the more...
4269088	4270489	in a structured part of the game.
4270809	4272390	Let's go into what's playing in the background.
4272910	4278534	This is a little clip from F-Zero that somebody has put into the little music maker in Mario Paint.
4280782	4281202	Well, right.
4281962	4296407	It did actually have a music program in there, and you could actually save things onto... I do believe that you could actually tape them, but it was very weird.
4296427	4299108	A lot of these are more... These days are done through an emulator now.
4299768	4309992	But there was... Going back to the art side of it, you could actually make stamps, and it came with stamps in it, too, and that was cool.
4311253	4332289	30 different colors, 60 different textures and patterns, 75 different stamps, 15 customizable stamps, battery backup, and special erasers like the fade erase, water erase, where the picture becomes a grayscale and vanishes, timed erase, rain erase, split image erase, pixelated erase, blinds erase, rocket erase, and abrupt erase.
4333070	4333811	I'm just imagining.
4334351	4338034	But here in the background... Turn it up a little bit.
4340963	4341954	We have Dragon Force.
4347361	4348802	I think this cheated a little bit though.
4348842	4352164	This is using one of those external Mario Paint emulator things.
4352184	4352865	Yeah, but still.
4353005	4353725	Yeah, same idea.
4354186	4354446	I know.
4354726	4357348	I included basically a lot of those just because I thought they were fun.
4358128	4365553	But yeah, there were the mini games called... A fly swatting game called Coffee Break or Nat Attack.
4366474	4372658	And you played as the Glove Hand, which as we all know was the boss in the Smash Bros.
4372698	4373258	games, right?
4373279	4373879	Yeah.
4374541	4376649	and it holds fly swatter and it has to swat things.
4377734	4378878	I love Nat Attack.
4381821	4391984	There was also a little mini-game on the title screen where you could click the letters to have a certain sequence of actions go on.
4392604	4394065	And then you could change the music.
4394125	4396946	I'd have Yoshi show up and paint the background.
4397566	4403868	And also, this is a game that has a particular... Yeah, I put Power Rangers on there too because it's funny.
4405629	4410210	But have you ever heard of a Totoka song, Rob?
4412234	4412394	No.
4413455	4417116	Kazumi Totoka was the guy who did a lot of Nintendo music.
4417656	4424259	And there's a song that is basically his little 19-note song that shows up in all the games he does stuff on.
4424279	4425119	It's a little Easter egg.
4425259	4428300	And it shows up... Oh, I have heard of that.
4428540	4429160	I have heard of that, yes.
4429180	4432642	But for anyone who doesn't know, on Animal Crossing, it actually was K.K.
4432622	4433002	's song.
4434082	4434822	In Animal Crossing.
4435503	4438044	So, that's when it... It was actually...
4439504	4439864	Oh, yeah.
4439904	4440084	Oh, yeah.
4467282	4473467	This is the song, um, uh, Airman, uh, La, Taos and I, I think, yeah.
4473527	4476209	I don't want to point out, this one is done in a legitimate Mario Paint.
4476349	4477069	Yeah, that one was.
4478350	4479371	And I thought it was very well done.
4480852	4486216	Um, but anyway, um, the first episode of Homestar Runner was animated in Mario Paint.
4487497	4488298	That's so awesome.
4489329	4490270	There have been sequels.
4490990	4515712	There was one on the Nintendo 64DD called Mario Artist, which was a launch title, and it brought out the mouse for the Nintendo 64, and it was to make 3D polygonal models, and you could actually insert images onto these 3D models using the Nintendo 64 capture cartridge, and then share your work with the communication kit online.
4517052	4523275	Although we didn't, of course, get that over here, but Mario Paint did have a sort of appearance in WarioWare Touched as WarioPaint.
4524576	4524816	Nice.
4524956	4527917	And you had the turntable and the toy room and all that.
4527937	4532319	And the Fly Splitting game was in WarioWare Mega Micro Games.
4533140	4537002	And Wii Photo Channel has an editing system that's similar to Mario Paint.
4537802	4544245	And then, like we were mentioning before, there have been standalone applications of the music program.
4546175	4547076	And I had to put that one on there.
4549998	4552200	You've been paint rolled.
4554222	4555823	So, the game is Mario Paint.
4557324	4558525	It is your classic game of the week.
4558846	4559666	Mario Paint!
4560027	4561628	Available on the Super Nintendo.
4562409	4565191	With yet another one of Nintendo's famous peripherals.
4565591	4565952	The mouse.
4566692	4568374	It was only on one game.
4568914	4571857	I want to say there was one other game that you could use it with.
4571877	4573178	I think you could also use it on the gun games.
4574102	4574703	I don't remember.
4574743	4578209	I want to say, couldn't you use it on, was it Lemmings you could use it on?
4578229	4579351	Lemmings, Lemmings you could.
4579632	4580213	Lemmings was one.
4580233	4583899	In fact, I think I remember that actually being sort of a feature of it, wasn't it?
4584500	4584881	I think so.
4585061	4586223	Lemmings kind of irritated me, though.
4588905	4589485	Anyway, that's it.
4589505	4589986	There you go.
4590006	4590646	Classic Game of the Week.
4590686	4593187	Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of our show tonight.
4593808	4594948	But stay tuned.
4595028	4596029	There's plenty more to come.
4596049	4597029	We're only halfway there.
4597470	4609556	In Part B tonight, your phone calls and more news, including some updates on Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, Batman Arkham Asylum, and some news about Capcom, and some more Xbox bundles coming soon.
4609936	4614919	So we're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4621754	4628716	So you've got a bunch of websites and podcasts about anime, manga, or video games, but you just don't have the time to read and listen to them all.
4629276	4632617	When are you actually going to find the time to play games or watch anime?
4635577	4636918	That's why there's Anigamers.

4673625	4676667	Because we all need another anime and gaming podcast.
4677727	4677887	Right?
4681377	4683558	Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here.
4684019	4688121	Recently, I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on Xbox Live.
4688481	4690482	Please, stop spewing hate speech on Xbox Live.
4690522	4696025	It doesn't make you look cool, it won't get you any friends, and at the end of the day, you still have an incredibly small penis.
4718815	4733624	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4733764	4736365	That's a little old school bumper bringing us back there.
4736385	4737086	That was my Wii.
4737326	4739988	That is like a million different people yelling out acronyms.
4740068	4741488	I still don't know what they mean to this day.
4741568	4743489	That was Megumi doing GGPO.
4743730	4744570	What does that even mean?
4744670	4745391	Good game, peace out.
4745751	4746551	Oh, okay.
4746571	4747512	Oh, nice.
4747572	4747792	All right.
4748459	4748839	There you go.
4750221	4752643	Alright, so yeah, those are our friends in StepSquad.
4752983	4754824	Is there still a StepSquad that plays DDR?
4755285	4757106	I'm sure StepSquad is still around.
4757647	4763292	Although, honestly, the last time I saw Jahi, every time I ever see him is like randomly in Japantown.
4763912	4765053	Like when I'm not even trying.
4765934	4768436	And I ran into Wendell at Faname last year.
4768456	4770938	I've seen him a few times recently.
4771358	4772439	And once at YaoiCon.
4772860	4773140	Nice.
4774121	4776743	I think he was working security or something.
4777717	4779238	Alright, very cool.
4781159	4786702	VXJ6V's in chat and says, I asked that four years ago when I was on the show and I guess I forgot what GGPL means.
4786802	4787363	My bad.
4787723	4787963	Nice.
4788283	4788663	What, Loki?
4788783	4793986	Before we started the second half here, I wanted to mention something I mentioned to you yesterday.
4794006	4794427	Uh-oh.
4797119	4807606	We all got 14-day trials to World of Warcraft from PAX, and my wife wants to try Warcraft.
4808247	4811049	Oh my god, the rapture is coming.
4812470	4813170	Start praying.
4814231	4815332	Wow, is she really going to do it?
4815672	4816232	I think she is.
4816412	4821556	I was going to say, she hates games, but she's going to start playing WoW.
4821716	4823938	Well, she's going to try the 14-day trial.
4823998	4825679	Wow, amazing.
4827433	4830800	I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun a little bit for emails.
4830960	4832283	We got one from Sakura Max.
4833065	4834087	This is from my cell phone.
4834167	4835089	I survived the hurricane.
4835149	4835810	No electricity.
4835870	4837013	Minimal damage to my house.
4837213	4837514	Thank you.
4838133	4839513	Yes, thank you for reminding.
4839834	4846815	There was that horrible hurricane that happened, and we hope any listener who is potentially impacted by that is doing okay.
4847435	4852237	From what I hear, it's a lot of really, really bad damage, but I don't know.
4852277	4858798	Last time I checked, I hope I don't make an ass of myself, but last time I checked, it didn't sound like the fatalities were nearly as bad as the last time we had a major hurricane in this country.
4858878	4860659	So I guess that's progress.
4861159	4861239	Yeah.
4862079	4863300	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4886997	4892259	And to respond to the chatroom, I'm not necessarily encouraging her to play.
4892299	4896481	That's something she wants to try because everyone keeps talking about it.
4897302	4898062	She feels left out.
4899202	4900983	I don't know if I would start playing.
4902304	4903264	I don't know if I want to.
4904465	4906165	Sharan in chat has a very strong opinion.
4906225	4911268	If Loki wants to help Nelly with World of Warcraft, he should just get her a real RPG instead.
4911308	4911728	Ooh, burn.
4913038	4914503	She doesn't have the patience for that stuff.
4915446	4919660	For the record, I actually, I'm not going back in the chat room because I keep getting dropped.
4921328	4923510	Yeah, we're having some network problems here in studio.
4923871	4924571	It's annoying!
4924792	4930277	Just another night here at OLR, so I guess maybe somebody will be buying me a new router soon, I don't know.
4930837	4932238	Alright, moving on.
4932679	4936402	We're going to get into some gaming news tonight here at Orange Launch Radio, some more.
4937343	4941587	We haven't even talked at all really about Xbox 360 news, and I think that's where we're going to start tonight, right Loki?
4941607	4942628	Yep.
4942728	4946171	There was of course some rumors coming out of PAX about a possible new...
4947432	4949013	Halo game coming out.
4949474	4954918	Then people realize, oh, it's just the map pack and there was new achievements that got leaked out and all that fun stuff.
4955318	4963464	Well, those new achievements have been confirmed as actual achievements that will be coming to Halo 3 and they're coming to Halo 3 later this month.
4964084	4972731	So you can expect for, I guess, I don't know how many new points they're going to add to it, but a whole bunch of new achievements.
4973431	4975133	I guess they'll come out with a new map pack.
4975153	4976894	So that'd be kind of neat.
4978066	4979867	and it's part of their title update too.
4981148	4982790	Well, hooray for them doing a big update.
4982830	4983450	It's going to be free?
4984211	4984331	Yes.
4984371	4984631	We hope.
4984971	4985432	Awesome.
4985532	4986392	The update will be free.
4986473	4989315	So the new achievements will probably be free, but map pack, probably not.
4990416	4996240	But remember, and not to discourage people buying it, but remember all those other map packs that they had out there?
4996380	4999523	Well, those eventually become free anyway, so... Dope.
4999823	5000483	Yeah, it's a rental.
5003326	5003666	All right.
5004286	5004947	Thanks for watching!
5023181	5027663	Big Dumb Fun has been ruined this week thanks to a leaked list of achievements.
5028443	5031204	Xbox360achievements.org, hey, you know what?
5031224	5032324	They were just doing their job.
5032364	5032924	That's what they do.
5033004	5034905	They uncover achievements as soon as they find out about them.
5035265	5041387	Well, it turns out the achievement list spoils the entire character roster for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.
5041447	5041507	Yay!
5041687	5042928	So now we know who's in the game.
5043328	5045389	And Midway kind of danced around this.
5045509	5047050	Obviously, you know someone was pissed.
5047371	5049312	You know somebody's head was rolling after this.
5049632	5052174	They initially said, we have not officially released it.
5052234	5055015	And then they came back and said, yeah, okay, it's true.
5055696	5056816	Dongle between our legs.
5057417	5057837	Run away.
5057897	5058537	Yipe, yipe, yipe.
5058738	5060639	All right, so here's the characters from Mortal Kombat.
5060699	5070145	Baraka, Jax, Kano, Katana, Liu Kang, Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, Sonya, and Sub-Zero.
5070785	5071125	DC Universe
5098894	5100355	DC Universe, Catwoman, Darkseed, Deathstroke, Darkseid,
5124567	5131370	Flash, Green Lantern, The Joker, Lex Luthor, Shazam, Superman, and Wonder Woman
5147338	5154281	Well, but that's what they're going to refer to him as in the game, probably, I guess, because if they're pulling this off the achievement list, they must be referring to him as that in the game.
5154502	5155422	So, interesting.
5157303	5157843	There you go.
5158423	5159264	Well, I'm excited.
5159644	5162726	Now we can finally throw down Wonder Woman vs. Catwoman.
5163026	5163766	That'll be awesome.
5164546	5165287	Looking forward to that.
5166327	5167748	Oh, this game comes out soon.
5167928	5168708	Be on the lookout for it.
5168748	5169709	It'll be out before the holidays.
5171275	5172296	and, uh, there you go.
5172756	5173116	I don't know.
5173316	5174677	November 19th, if I remember correctly.
5174697	5175077	Is that it?
5175257	5175577	Alright.
5176378	5177338	Just in time for Thanksgiving.
5178138	5180540	I just wish they'd have, like, other unlockable characters later on.
5180580	5181240	That would be neat.
5181340	5183601	They may, and they may have pay-to-unlock characters.
5183621	5184041	Who knows?
5184121	5187563	You know, this is the first Mortal Kombat on the next-gen system, am I right?
5187943	5188263	Yeah.
5188363	5189584	Yeah, so who knows?
5189644	5191165	They might have the downloadable characters.
5191185	5191805	That'd be kind of cool.
5192745	5193566	DC Universe, DC Universe
5213144	5214265	Mark Hamill is the one.
5214665	5215026	I'm sorry.
5215326	5223012	When I think Joker, when I'm not thinking of the comic books, I'm thinking of animated series Joker just because he's so goofball.
5223353	5223873	I think it's cool.
5224073	5226495	You don't think about the movies, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson?
5226515	5227916	I have not seen Dark Knight, remember?
5229037	5230118	I'm going to see it in IMAX.
5230498	5231559	It was pretty impressive.
5231719	5233001	I'm going to see it in IMAX.
5233301	5233661	It's here.
5234201	5235342	I know.
5235583	5237484	When I go see it, it will be in IMAX.
5238445	5238885	Have fun.
5239146	5241948	But this makes me very, very, very, very giddy.
5242310	5243891	Actdeft agrees in chatroom.
5243911	5249674	Chat.orange.com says Mark Hamill is the Joker and Solid Goomba simply says, fuck yeah, Mark Hamill.
5249914	5252295	What is it about Mark Hamill that makes him so fucking amazing?
5252916	5254376	He does the best Joker.
5254436	5254997	I'm sorry.
5255397	5261120	Then he was, what was it in Jay and Silent Bob Cockknocker?
5261940	5263901	Yes, he was also in Jay and Silent Bob Strikeback.
5263941	5264862	But there's more news.
5266482	5268083	You could appear in the game.
5268703	5269003	Really?
5269223	5269283	Me?
5269303	5271144	There could be Rob in the game.
5271244	5271444	Me?
5271464	5272784	Little me?
5273265	5279227	There is a contest right now from GI that will allow the winner to become an Arkham inmate.
5279947	5282968	And you get your cell decked out with personal photos and wall scribbles.
5283109	5284149	That's more of a Loki role.
5285309	5285970	Don't you think?
5286290	5287330	I would be all over that.
5287690	5292252	And all of my graffiti would be, Hi Mom, I'm in jail.
5292992	5293653	I like it here.
5293773	5294313	It's nice.
5294935	5304379	I think, and I don't know if Travis still does this on Under Station Live, but maybe my voice could be something like, I've been here for seven years, the medication doesn't work.
5305379	5307360	Does he still do that on Under Station Live?
5307400	5307960	I don't even know.
5310682	5312202	That sounds weird.
5312242	5318685	No, there was this old soundbite he used to play all the freaking time of this guy going, I've been here for seven years.
5319878	5322659	DJ Dark Knight says, I can't see Jamie being in jail.
5322699	5324380	Oh, how little you know Jamie.
5324400	5326761	I've been in jail before.
5338695	5341237	Alabama, they make you either sleep or read the Bible.
5341257	5341317	Huh.
5367509	5368810	And then my mom came and got me.
5370551	5370952	Wow.
5371272	5371813	I never knew that.
5371953	5372373	Interesting.
5373534	5375636	Six years and I never knew that Jamie was in jail.
5377517	5379539	There's quite a bit about me you don't know, Rob.
5379559	5380279	Apparently.
5381500	5382521	Now the internet snows.
5383702	5384383	It wasn't real jail.
5384503	5384883	Yeah, I know.
5384903	5385524	It wasn't real jail.
5385824	5386144	Okay.
5386204	5387245	We all did dumb shit as a kid.
5387585	5387865	All right.
5387905	5388306	Yes, Loki.
5389448	5400116	So, of course, with the announcement of the price drop last week, the Xbox sales numbers are apparently doubling, according to Microsoft.
5400156	5403818	And I guess we'll have to see when the MPD numbers come out at the beginning of October.
5404519	5406840	But that's pretty promising.
5407020	5409322	I mean, not a big surprise that, I don't know...
5410600	5412241	It's selling well when it's cheaper.
5412962	5415823	I mean, that's, I guess, a shocker to a lot of people.
5416744	5417565	No, wait, no, it's not.
5417785	5418525	Is it Christmas yet?
5420266	5422208	Well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens with this.
5422368	5422988	That's what I'm curious.
5423048	5424889	Is this a trend that's going to continue through Christmas?
5425490	5425930	I don't know.
5426070	5429612	Are Xbox 360s now going to sell because everybody got a Wii last Christmas?
5430313	5430713	I don't know.
5430733	5430993	Who knows?
5431514	5436557	I still hear, and it really irks me, not that I'm picking sides or anything, but
5438288	5438708	But you are.
5439989	5440429	I'm not.
5440889	5441509	Really, I'm not.
5441649	5444690	But when Sony comes out and says, oh yeah, we're winning.
5445510	5448171	How are you winning when you have a quarter of the market?
5448331	5448771	Abba.
5450192	5450372	What?
5451132	5451452	Abba.
5451892	5452472	No, no.
5453333	5455473	Listen, Abba ain't gonna do shit.
5456974	5457654	Bite your tongue.
5457794	5458814	Abba ain't gonna do shit.
5458955	5459655	That's what I'm saying.
5459755	5460895	No one buys SingStar.
5461255	5462035	Okay, nobody.
5463236	5464016	Unless you're in Europe.
5464676	5465056	I hate you.
5465096	5465817	I don't know you anymore.
5465857	5466697	I just own you as a friend.
5468117	5468798	And you know what?
5469740	5471022	I thought Mamma Mia sucked.
5471684	5473988	Get out of my house!
5477795	5483197	It just irks me when they say that they're winning, but it's like, dude, listen, you're not even close to winning.
5483317	5493402	I mean, if you were like, you know, the Wii back in June when you were like 10,000 units away from becoming number one, yeah, that's close to winning.
5493722	5497244	When you're millions of units behind, that's not close to winning.
5497544	5500185	Okay, so don't talk that you're going to do it.
5500305	5501566	You're going to do it by like year's end.
5501646	5502086	You're not.
5502106	5503407	You're not going to do it by year's end.
5504995	5506096	2011, okay, so stop it.
5506717	5507097	Seriously.
5507617	5511740	So, are you saying that SingStarAba's not going to sell well?
5513841	5517564	Would you care to make a little wager on SingStarAba selling well or not?
5517584	5518124	No, I'm not.
5520025	5521086	It doesn't have to be Tingle.
5521306	5522667	I can think of far better punishments.
5523307	5524168	No, it's not.
5526018	5526299	Damn.
5527221	5528745	Everybody make chicken noises at Loki.
5529086	5531632	I'll think about it, but I'm pretty sure it's not.
5531772	5533015	Oh, he said I think about it.
5533597	5534479	I gotta do my research.
5535925	5538105	Rob, I will totally play Singstar with you.
5538625	5538986	I know.
5539466	5540946	You're getting the ABBA one, right?
5540986	5545907	The chat room is demanding it on Justin TV when it comes out.
5546527	5547027	So we'll see.
5548347	5548667	We'll see.
5552308	5553148	Moving on.
5553928	5557589	We'll see how the Xbox 360 sells after the price drop.
5557609	5560749	Moving on into Christmas, I think they're going to continue to sell pretty well.
5561269	5564030	The question is, will they overtake Nintendo or will Sony answer them?
5564630	5565170	That's another one.
5566479	5567880	A lot of people seem doubtful, but who knows?
5569540	5575342	Another game that a lot of folks have been playing on their Xbox 360s as well as their PlayStation 3s, Burnout Paradise.
5575923	5580664	And the long-awaited motorcycle download is coming on September 18th.
5580724	5582685	It's actually a new patch, basically.
5582725	5584266	It's a free download update.
5585586	5589828	38 new clock race events, dynamic weather events, effects...
5590882	5600131	Dynamic Weather Effects, a day-night cycle, meaning the game goes up from day to night, 70 new challenges in the Freeburns thing, and motorcycles.
5600571	5603073	So that's pretty cool, but when are they adding the airplanes?
5603114	5604935	That's what I want to know, because they're talking about adding airplanes.
5605456	5607077	What about giant enemy crabs?
5607618	5610741	Yes, I want to be able to drive a giant enemy crab.
5611241	5611321	Um...
5612963	5619268	This is one of those games that I played for like three days and I never played again, and I keep thinking I need to go back and play it again.
5619328	5622771	This is giving me the incentive to do so, so I'm definitely going to have to check it out.
5623172	5623732	Sounds pretty cool.
5624193	5626895	Have you been playing any Burnout Paradise, Loki, or is this kind of put it away?
5626915	5631859	No, I just noticed the other day that I still have my copy of Burnout Paradise sitting on a shelf.
5633298	5661788	um it just came out at a bad time from what I remember I need to go back and look look at it again it was better than the last one but I don't know it's just when the next big game came out I forgot about it and sadly enough you know with like Rock Band 2 and stuff when Saints Row 2 comes out I'm gonna forget about Rock Band 2 never I'll never forget about Rock Band 2 hey they're doing a pretty good job trying to extend the life of it with the challenges and everything but anyway let's move on
5662674	5663455	Moving on.
5663795	5664216	Yes, please.
5665337	5669943	Well, you know one of my favorite ever companies is Capcom, right?
5671465	5671645	Yep.
5672185	5673046	They were nice to me.
5673607	5674828	I don't know why they were mean to you.
5675269	5676490	Do we have to go back there again?
5676510	5677752	Because don't get me started.
5678012	5679194	Do not go there.
5680170	5691374	Capcom is planning on doing all of their major titles on multiple platforms to maximize their impact in the United States, especially outside of Japan.
5691554	5697737	It's actually quoted as saying basically where the consoles are practically waging war on one another.
5698677	5699838	and their annual report.
5701038	5711642	It said, completing implementation of multi-platform development on major titles means that all major titles launched during the next fiscal year or thereafter will be developed as multi-platform games.
5712462	5719265	So that's why we should be, that's why Devil May Cry 4, for example.
5720345	5721085	Or Mega Man 9.
5721346	5722026	Mega Man 9, exactly.
5722046	5725047	A lot of us assumed it was going to be WiiWare only and then suddenly it's shown up everywhere.
5726638	5747416	MT Framework is actually supposed to be for PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 development Resident Evil 5, Street Fighter 4 are among the list and so they're also thinking about including a few more casual games like for Wii and other more casual game systems
5747916	5749037	Are you talking about Man of Power Battles?
5765313	5773217	No, it was an actual side-scroller in the vein of the Nintendo games, but with better graphics at the time, because it was on PC.
5773658	5776019	I don't know, maybe somebody in the chatroom knows more about this and can remember.
5776059	5781782	I actually bought this game way back when, in the early 90s, and it had three boss monsters, so it was short.
5782122	5784543	But I remember one of them was electricity-based, as you remember.
5786264	5788806	It wasn't based on... They were new Mega Man monsters.
5789606	5791147	It was a completely different Mega Man game.
5792488	5793068	I'm not crazy.
5793638	5821453	well in other news they also are they stated also again in their annual report Capcom did that there are more western focused titles in development one of them named Dark Void if you know we remember that and they plan to aggressively acquire partners and other studios especially independent developers the ones that will share their vision so I think that that's
5822817	5826220	Sounding to me like a potential good thing.
5830663	5832305	I found the information on Wikipedia.
5832585	5833065	Did you now?
5833085	5835707	Yes, it was by Hitech Expressions.
5835747	5836388	It was released in 1990.
5836948	5839130	It was just licensed by Capcom.
5839390	5843053	There were three robot masters, Voltman, Sonicman, and Dynaman.
5843453	5845775	And there were only two levels in the Wily Fortress.
5845795	5846576	So it was a short game.
5847469	5848010	Yeah, I'd say.
5848290	5851173	And there were other versions on PC, I guess, too.
5851513	5852294	I never knew about those.
5852334	5853075	I just had the first one.
5853315	5854937	I don't think the PC versions were very good.
5857039	5859682	They were cool when I was a kid, but I don't think they're cool now.
5859802	5859962	What?
5860002	5860603	Thanks to you.
5860903	5862004	Huh?
5862345	5864207	The Airman Can't Be Defeated song.
5866489	5867170	Whose fault is that?
5867530	5867831	Yours.
5869545	5880713	Well, some things that are good come in threes, I guess, including a bundle that's being released by Microsoft coming out later this holiday.
5881413	5894903	It's a brand new 12-month live gold kit, and it's going to come with Project Gotham Racing 4, a 12-plus-one-month card of live, and the Xbox...
5896444	5898746	360 Messenger Kit and it's going to run you $69.99.
5899086	5910757	This was rumored to be coming out from the GameStop Expo although it's on their website now and I personally know it's coming out so it is coming out.
5910897	5911718	It's kind of a good deal.
5912899	5918724	There was some other bundle that they were talking about coming out as well that I haven't heard anything on but I know this one for sure is coming out.
5920555	5921495	RedRingsOfDeath.com
5945560	5946000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5969979	5994024	apparently he went on and talked about these two different Red Ring of Death scenarios a reproducible crash that could happen in NBA 2K6 was one game that you could reproduce the crash in and apparently some dashboard update bugs in Dead Rising apparently he's being very standoffish about it he doesn't care that the former employer of his wants to sue him and says if they want to come after me, bring it on
5995560	5996321	Very interesting.
5997121	6002926	But, you know, he did probably violate the terms of employment that he had with Microsoft and all these companies that he was working through.
6002966	6007430	I mean, you do kind of don't talk about the products like this, especially on a website.
6007470	6014416	It's a little... I hope he knows what he's talking about because he's going to have to prove, well...
6015461	6017843	Yeah, I guess he's going to have to prove that he's telling the truth.
6018724	6020846	DarkTetsuya says, wow, the cojones on this guy.
6020866	6021446	Yeah, for real.
6021907	6024449	Ranma says, didn't he sign an NDA that forbade him from saying this?
6024609	6025990	I'm sure he must have.
6026010	6030534	If he didn't sign the NDA, unless it was specific, or I don't know.
6031676	6042882	Maybe, but even still though, I mean, they can get him on that, but at the same time, I mean, he's hoping to open like a whole other can of worms with, you know, Microsoft knew about these defects and they didn't do anything about it.
6043162	6045043	Ah, I see, so he's trying to be a hero, basically.
6045244	6045524	Yeah.
6046444	6047985	Well, we know what happens to heroes.
6048145	6048365	Yes.
6048425	6049346	They become martyrs.
6051887	6053188	Well, let's hope it doesn't get that bad.
6053668	6054829	But, well, there you go.
6055529	6060112	We'll keep you updated if we hear anything else in the adventures of this guy and his soon-to-be legal troubles.
6060643	6062383	Well, something that might not be soon to happen.
6062543	6070505	I mean, they're talking about it, but I'm still thinking that it'll be out when another title with its name comes out.
6071925	6075486	There's supposed to be a Duke Nukem movie.
6076606	6076866	Yeah.
6077327	6087829	Scott Fay, the one who's doing Max Payne, was saying that he's working on a movie scenario that he thinks will do the character and the series justice.
6088729	6088969	But
6091033	6097115	I'm honestly really expecting to see it more along the lines of when Duke Nukem Forever comes out.
6097715	6098135	Maybe.
6099235	6112199	But he also says that Depth Entertainment will be doing with trying to work on a few other cross-media franchises going into games and film.
6113000	6113160	And
6114480	6118964	They actually are still at work at doing American McGee's Alice.
6120245	6122467	And Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't doing that anymore, by the way.
6123988	6124408	Oh, really?
6125609	6125769	Yep.
6126590	6130013	You know she changed her last name officially for her husband?
6131294	6134316	That's one of those Hollywood relationships that has actually stayed together, so good for them.
6134576	6138059	As an anniversary present, I thought that was really sweet.
6139020	6149187	Well, if you want to hear something even more ridiculous, there was a rumor coming around about a Craigslist entry that said they were casting for a Rock Band 2 TV show.
6149768	6155392	Well, apparently it is true, and it's going to be officially launched next week.
6156093	6158574	Rock Band 2, the show, and...
6160620	6161661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6179385	6182447	And what exactly will be on the Rock Band show?
6182547	6184407	Just watching people play Rock Band?
6184607	6189890	Basically, you're going to follow... I guess they're going to set up some band teams or whatever.
6189950	6192151	It's a 30-minute commercial for the game is what it is.
6192311	6193111	Basically, yeah.
6193271	6196693	Well, when you're MTV and you put out the game, you can kind of do that.
6197733	6198694	Besides, you know what?
6198974	6202535	I don't see this being much worse than some of the other programming on that station.
6202555	6204596	True, I guess it would be better than The Hills.
6204896	6205397	So there you go.
6206517	6220330	Well, you know, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear about one of my favorite music games, Jumping the Shark, and becoming a half-hour commercial TV series, and reminding us why MTV is a little bit poison for this series, or a lot of it poison, I get very angsty.
6220410	6225215	I don't know about you guys, but it makes me just want to get out the angst in a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
6241365	6244287	My FU goes to bullshit and the mouths it spews from.
6246509	6246789	Loki.
6247289	6256976	My FU goes to EA for saying that the Rock Band 2 drums are supposed to be out today and not actually shipping the Rock Band 2 drums to anybody, so it's a big clusterfuck.
6258257	6258577	Thank you.
6260076	6264539	My FU goes to whatever little animal decided to crawl under our house and die.
6265620	6271403	Because it happened on, I guess, Friday when we started noticing that something smells like death.
6272344	6276506	So now the animal control people aren't going to be able to even come out until Monday because we think it's a cat.
6277487	6281029	Because there was a cat that was sometimes in our backyard that just looked like hell.
6281610	6283411	And it's not around anymore.
6284423	6292313	So, you know, although I am sad for little kitty, F you to deciding to die under our house and not in, say, the neighbor's pool.
6293014	6293355	Come on.
6297520	6298181	It's just gross.
6299563	6299843	All right.
6300284	6301245	That's it for the FUs of the week.
6303103	6309007	But boy, we get into some FUs of the century when we talk about some of the gaming industry's biggest controversies they've ever had.
6309628	6312450	This is on a website called MCVUK.com.
6312470	6315152	They ran a top ten list this week of gaming's biggest controversies.
6315532	6319255	Hey, if you want to get your website on Digg, just add a top ten list.
6319435	6319975	Seriously.
6320035	6324999	That's all you ever see on Digg are these top ten lists from these sites I'd never heard of until I see the top ten list.
6325459	6326740	So, there you go.
6327661	6330503	Anyhow, here's a quick rundown of what the controversies are.
6330523	6331144	Number one...
6331724	6332745	Night Trap with Dana Plato
6349363	6350304	Caramageddon Caramageddon
6377398	6378038	Caramageddon!
6402878	6406160	Well, you know, in Summer Showdown for the U.S.
6406280	6408722	one they put in, well, I think it was the U.S.
6408742	6411364	one they had sweat instead of blood like in the Japanese one.
6411656	6412276	Yeah, a little silly.
6413217	6414758	And in the German one, they had robots.
6415058	6417219	Not even people, but robots that you ran over.
6418220	6425885	America's Army is number four, and it has to do with that, you know, the game was developed and is being used as a recruitment tool.
6426705	6432129	Ubisoft kind of has gotten itself in a little bit of trouble for publishing the console version of the title.
6432909	6440274	Apparently, there was like a demonstration outside of their offices after this whole thing, because they actually went and published a console version, and that was...
6442012	6442540	Really bad.
6445167	6448829	It's basically a giant recruitment tool, which in a way is controversial in itself.
6450390	6453931	Number five was something called Murder by PlayStation.
6454712	6459334	Apparently it was some type of story that was actually released.
6459654	6463136	Oh, it was a headline that was actually in a paper on the Daily Mail.
6463736	6468278	And it was actually a story about a 14-year-old kid who was murdered by a 17-year-old kid.
6468798	6472340	And the newspaper claimed that the kid was obsessed with Manhunt.
6473021	6478189	And by the way, police did say there was absolutely no link between the game and the killing.
6479231	6484038	But yet that headline, Murder by PlayStation, giant bold letters, still exists.
6485071	6487674	Number 6 on the list, The Guy Game.
6487734	6489035	Remember The Guy Game, Loki?
6489335	6491137	We covered The Guy Game on this program.
6491277	6494400	The Guy Game was awesome, except for the 17-year-old that got in it.
6495261	6497783	That caused the game to get pulled from shelves everywhere.
6498064	6499465	Dude, seriously.
6499605	6503929	I mean, yeah, because tits on a 17-year-old really change a lot in a year.
6504890	6505311	Seriously.
6506311	6506631	It's gay.
6507872	6510253	Well, I don't... Actually, no, it wouldn't be gay.
6510393	6511353	Well, I don't... Unless you're a woman.
6512053	6513934	Because that game screws another of the same gender.
6514915	6518556	It was just... I mean, obviously, it's a big no-no and very irresponsible.
6518576	6519877	It's her fault anyway.
6519937	6521137	She lied about her age.
6521998	6523278	It's just irresponsible.
6523298	6523698	Dumb bitch.
6523998	6527340	But the game... They could be having Guy Game 4 by now.
6527540	6532582	Yeah, if you cut this little element out of the game, we'd be on, like, Guy Game, you know, on Xbox Live Arcade.
6532602	6533202	It would be awesome.
6533342	6534663	Hell yeah.
6534683	6534723	Uh...
6535819	6539260	Number 7, Hot Coffee, All I Need to Say.
6540561	6542642	If you don't know enough about that by now, where have you been?
6543242	6546323	Number 8 was when the BBFC tackled Ban Hunt 2.
6546423	6552005	Of course, there was all the controversy around that, and then that got banned, and then it wasn't, and then the game sucked anyway, remember?
6553886	6560929	Number 9 was Goat Gate, which is another way to refer to, remember the Greek god launch party for God of War 2 over in Europe?
6561389	6562949	And they actually slaughtered a live goat.
6564010	6564510	Remember that?
6565982	6569604	I don't think that... Marketing genius over there.
6572826	6573706	Dot, dot, dot.
6573746	6574747	That's all I have to say.
6574867	6575607	Dot, dot, dot.
6575968	6579630	And then the last controversy on the list, because I know you're all loving this.
6580470	6581731	Sony versus God.
6582471	6592257	And it has to do with the fact that the Church of England was actually used, Manchester Cathedral, its church, was actually used in Resistance Fall of Man, and they were not happy about that.
6592857	6610218	I remember that we covered that on the show a little while ago so there you have it the top 10 biggest controversies according to MCV UK so it is a little more UK based hence why we had a couple of those in there but I would say UK or not those are pretty good entries on the list very controversial anything you think they left off
6611715	6619721	Remember the PSP ad that was almost racist because it had the white and the black and it was bad.
6619801	6620241	Remember that?
6620261	6622943	That was somehow left off the list.
6623563	6626045	Just another brilliant Sony marketing scheme from the day.
6626125	6627086	Anything else you guys can think of?
6627106	6627666	I don't know.
6627686	6628727	I think they hit most of the good ones.
6630928	6631629	We'll see in chat.
6631669	6634291	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if anybody thinks of anything.
6634611	6636012	No Custer's Revenge either.
6636832	6639334	There's usually a Custer's Revenge that shows up on a list like that.
6640660	6644261	Alright, let's see what you guys have to say in our mailbag.
6644321	6649743	Every week you guys email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read your emails here live on the show.
6649803	6652624	So let's open up ye olde mailbag and see what emails we've got.
6659186	6664448	First email comes from Cheeseburger and it says, I'm sorry I got you mad last week.
6664588	6666809	Can you please tell me more about Gatchaman, please?
6666849	6667429	Did I spell that right?
6667449	6668389	Yes, you did spell it right.
6668749	6669970	Gatchaman is awesome!
6671794	6675639	1972 anime character designs done by Amano.
6676259	6679483	Just go look it up on Wikipedia and then go watch all of it.
6680384	6681645	That's the only way you'll appease me.
6683267	6683507	Nice.
6684454	6685555	Hey, OLR crew.
6685695	6686535	This next email, by the way.
6687536	6693799	After listening to last week's show, I figured it right in to clarify on what the Rob D was saying about me shaking while at the mic.
6694599	6697741	It wasn't while at the mic that my hands started to shake, but after.
6698321	6705605	It was a bit of a rush being on the air with a bunch of internet celebrities who are too humble to admit they really are celebrities, however minor.
6706225	6706945	I am not.
6707926	6711908	I am actually egotistical enough to admit my celebrity-dom on the internet.
6713086	6714146	Curse you, Adrenaline!
6714887	6724651	Anyway, it was great meeting you all at PAX and was very glad that I made it to Wild Ginger that night in one piece as the food and conversation were awesome.
6724911	6726852	Who knew mango could make pork taste like beef?
6726932	6729694	This is talking about the Chinese restaurant all us all games people went to, yeah?
6729814	6732595	As I ordered the mango pork and it was freaking fantastic.
6733515	6734456	Yeah, the food I had was good too.
6736300	6738681	Plus I had to be the best stand pad thai I've ever had.
6738761	6742384	It made being lost in the scuzzy part of Seattle at night totally worth it.
6742684	6743965	That was really good pad thai.
6744205	6745446	I agree with that because I had some too.
6746507	6751330	I didn't just write to reminisce and sing praises though.
6751650	6756093	A few episodes back you guys were talking about Dragon's Lair and Space Ace and they should be put on PS3.
6756373	6759976	Well good news, not only are they playable on PS3, but any Blu-ray player...
6761465	6768490	I've actually had them in stock where I work for quite some time now, and I'm kind of shocked they aren't on shelves with the games at other stores as well.
6768990	6770571	You can put links on Amazon.
6771011	6777235	Actually, I think the reason I didn't get them is because I've already got the HD versions for PC.
6777976	6780798	But I hope I passed the grammar Nazi test here.
6781098	6785641	You almost did, but for right is W-R-I-T-E, not R-I-G-H-T.
6787222	6789423	I can't wait until next year's PAX, assuming I can go.
6789483	6790224	Cheers, Decipher.
6792253	6792954	Yay!
6792974	6793074	P.S.
6793494	6798418	This email was brought to you by the OLR Mailbag, home of the never-ending Olive Garden references.
6799399	6801761	I actually haven't had an Olive Garden reference in a little while, but there you go.
6802121	6802421	Thank you.
6802641	6803682	Rob, let's go to Olive Garden.
6803882	6805083	Dude, I really want Olive Garden.
6805103	6805664	We have to.
6806044	6807145	You know where I went this week?
6807445	6808426	It was Carino's.
6808686	6809147	Good stuff.
6810148	6810688	I've never been there.
6811529	6812129	Nom, nom, nom.
6812169	6815552	I'd take you to Pasquale's, but I don't think they have anything light, though.
6816348	6822329	Or we should go to a little... They have a little joint here in Sacramento called Español, which is the Italian place with a Spanish name.
6822509	6823010	It's really good.
6823370	6823610	Okay.
6823630	6825030	I have a very yummy minestrone soup.
6825590	6827311	Mmm, Orange Lounge Foodio.
6827811	6828751	Hey, OLR.
6829311	6829911	Hi.
6830571	6834252	I just have to say, I love that on this show when we're not talking about video games, we're talking about food.
6834952	6835292	It's great.
6835312	6836032	I have gushy foods.
6837673	6840534	Ooh, Rob D says Never Ending Pasta is going on at Olive Garden right now.
6840854	6842434	Dude, we are there, okay?
6843990	6853597	Hey, OLR, I read this on the FAQs of EA's new Sports World site, which is their online community for their sports games.
6854137	6857019	One of the questions is why there's no female avatar option.
6857419	6862102	Their response was, quote, question, why is there no female avatar image?
6862503	6868386	In an effort to align EA Sports World with our primary user base, the decision was made to use a male avatar image for its launch.
6868787	6871609	However, a female avatar image is planned for future releases soon.
6872489	6875251	is it just me or are they making an assumption about who plays their games?
6875391	6887138	I'm not a female but I think that it is kind of sexist to gear a sports game towards males only and assume that all the women are playing Barbie Island Princess or bake cakes although cakes are great
6889059	6900529	Maybe I am completely stupid and don't see why this is okay, but I'm sure many women across the world play sports games and other types of traditionally male games like GTA, other FPSs, etc.
6901089	6905633	Well, thanks for reading this, and remember, if you are in the All Games chatroom, DMN can't kick you.
6906334	6909016	The cake is light, PKJr92, Yaris sucks.
6909216	6914921	Well, you have to understand that until EA Sports releases, you know...
6916022	6922108	DinnerMaking09, you know, they're not going to have female avatars, unfortunately.
6923890	6927894	TheRobD says in chat, translation, their response was, girls don't play games.
6928395	6929436	Is this true, DarkSakura?
6929476	6930377	Do girls not play games?
6932222	6933323	I beg to differ.
6934343	6935024	I had a feeling.
6935124	6938806	I bet we have some more listeners out there that beg to differ as well.
6938966	6939967	Remember though, Rob.
6940307	6940527	What?
6940667	6943849	Remember me telling you that there was a football game I actually liked?
6944390	6945050	Tecmo Bowl.
6945330	6946351	No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl.
6946791	6947132	It was...
6949679	6951662	Great, now I can't remember, but it had a cool name.
6952683	6957150	It was that one football game that was on Super Nintendo.
6957290	6958491	Must have had a lasting impression.
6959653	6960835	I can never remember the name of it, too.
6960855	6962137	It was the problem with it.
6962217	6963398	Was it with the four-player thing?
6963418	6964640	Was it Super Tecmo Bowl?
6964860	6966663	No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl anything.
6967256	6995469	High Impact High Impact, thank you, it was super high impact I just had a feeling, and I said that before I saw DarkTips to be a Satan shit I was gonna say also that, um, yeah, girls don't play games and EA doesn't release games that aren't buggy That just means that girls play good games You know how I feel about sports games, you guys Look, I respect those of you guys that choose to play them, but for me, Tecmo Bowl or GTFO No, it's all about that hockey game on Saturn
6997543	6998664	or Blades of Steel.
6999165	6999845	Thank you.
7000626	7001387	Anyhow, go ahead.
7002048	7004870	Hockey is fantastic too because blood bounces on ice.
7005611	7007633	You know NHL 09 came out this last week.
7008394	7009635	We should check it out just for fun.
7009655	7011397	I used to watch hockey regularly.
7011497	7012658	Let's get into sports games.
7012738	7014019	I wouldn't buy NHL 09.
7014900	7016141	I want a rugby game.
7016802	7018904	I want someone to send me a rugby game, okay?
7019184	7044155	apparently it's got some sort of memory leak in the cache file on the on your hard drive and will stop working after a while oh shit can you imagine if we came on the show one week and during how was your gaming week suddenly it's like Jamie's talking about yeah I played NHL 09 this week I'm like yeah I played Madden Loki's like I played Hello Kitty Island Adventure and then we never mind no it would be like I was gonna say then we'd be AGI but you know
7049027	7059456	If you wanted to do the complete role reversal here, I would be playing Imagine Babies, and Rob would be playing Yaris, and Matt would be playing the Tingle game.
7061301	7062943	It's a tangle game, seriously.
7063303	7064625	For April Fool's Day next year.
7064665	7065866	Alright, next email, next email.
7065886	7067347	Hey guys, Dan Shadow here.
7067848	7071071	I've been meaning to email you guys for quite some time, but I've been very busy lately.
7071191	7071972	Welcome to the club.
7072753	7077498	If this email seems long, it's because with every new episode, there's a new subject to talk about.
7077978	7079240	This segment goes to Rob.
7079660	7080241	Hi Rob!
7080401	7081061	Hi me!
7081882	7082403	Who's this from?
7082903	7083544	Dan Shadow.
7083664	7084285	Hi Dan Shadow.
7085410	7088351	A while back you mentioned going out to Long Beach and visiting the Queen Mary.
7088731	7093233	I laughed when you mentioned that because I currently live in Long Beach and next year I will be getting married on the Queen Mary.
7093473	7094454	It's a big boat.
7095434	7096795	My wedding will be booze themed.
7097155	7097835	Chew on that.
7098776	7098916	Aww.
7099276	7102577	I also wanted to point out that I am your Brazilian listener.
7103057	7106519	I haven't been there in 10 years because, well, it's just better to live here.
7106899	7110760	However, I will return next summer to have my new wife meet my family there.
7111221	7113021	Brazilian listener!
7113482	7113782	Awesome.
7115809	7117550	I've been craving Brazilian grill.
7118130	7119171	You don't even know how long.
7119531	7120512	You know what I'm talking about.
7120532	7122393	Like the Espatuse place in San Francisco.
7122413	7123273	I've never been there, Rob.
7123633	7127536	Oh, they have a thing like it in Sacramento now called Taste of Brazil or something like that.
7128156	7132658	And basically that's where they bring the big slabs of meat on the swords and just slice off a slab of meat.
7132678	7133919	Do we have to order in Portuguese?
7134700	7135480	No, I don't believe you do.
7135660	7136421	You don't order at all.
7136461	7137541	You just pay.
7137561	7138622	You have a little dial.
7138662	7139602	Green means go.
7139682	7140563	Red means stop.
7140843	7141423	Sweet.
7141964	7144085	I'm so there when I'm eating meat again.
7145322	7146903	Thinking about playing Warhammer Online?
7147323	7147643	Do it!
7148064	7151445	I've been in the closed and open beta, and I can tell you right now it's worth it.
7151806	7152546	Here's an example.
7152626	7156448	Let's say you're a squig hunter, and you want to drop aggro.
7157008	7157989	You don't feign death.
7158049	7161851	Instead, you will piss yourself, and the enemy won't touch you after that.
7162901	7163201	Nice.
7163462	7170049	Yeah, the orcs and goblins are on the comedic side, but if you want to be serious cool, then play as the high elves.
7170069	7174354	I will be in the head start, so if you decide to get it, let me know and we can play on the same server.
7175135	7176557	No, on the head server, sorry.
7176857	7180021	No, it says I will be in the head start, so if you decide to play, blah blah.
7181622	7183604	On another note, I can't wait for LittleBigPlanet.
7183624	7186047	That seems like a game that can't possibly get old.
7186487	7188209	Oh, and Rock Band 2 equals Party Night.
7188669	7190952	This email is brought to you by StrongBad.
7191372	7193995	Keeping my Wii alive with his never-ending style.
7195151	7197514	I played Final Fantasy XI
7216555	7218136	Star Trek Online!
7219036	7219876	Star Trek Online!
7219896	7220396	Star Trek Online!
7220416	7220496	No!
7220516	7221116	Don't do it, Rob!
7221136	7221536	Don't do it!
7221596	7224297	If you can level by yourself, then it's better.
7244463	7273389	you can level, like let's say you're level 12 and your friend is level 70 your level 70 friend can cap himself to 12 and level with you and you guys both still get experience so you can level at any level, kinda neat I will stay level 1 forever seriously I will not be playing this bullshit Final Fantasy bullshit unless it's Penn and Teller's Final Fantasy bullshit then I'll play that
7274625	7275946	I somehow don't see that happening.
7276927	7277888	That should be a bullshit game.
7277908	7278288	That'd be cool.
7278829	7284153	I do see myself going out, at least checking out Warhammer for a month or two before I see myself going back to Fafixi.
7285715	7286495	Alright, next email.
7286976	7288317	Star Trek Online!
7288337	7289238	Yeah, and then there's that.
7289298	7290599	Star Trek Online!
7290619	7292120	I'm hoping that gets delayed to 2010.
7292341	7293642	Star Trek Online!
7293922	7294422	Alright, shut up.
7294462	7295183	Read the next email.
7295844	7296364	Shut up and read.
7296384	7296905	Jeez, Rob.
7297725	7299727	Yeah, well, bite my big bloody left toe.
7300548	7301188	Sorry, that's my right toe.
7302308	7306511	Hey guys, I've been listening to your podcast for about the last year.
7307291	7309653	Even though I can't listen to it live because I have school.
7310533	7313075	You guys are my favorite podcast and I never miss your show.
7313715	7315476	I haven't been able to get a 360 yet.
7315616	7318298	It sucks because my mom and dad won't let me get one.
7318418	7321940	They think that I shouldn't get another system even though I want to trade in my PS2.
7322520	7325522	Anyway, since I have nothing to do and want to save money, I've been...
7327023	7328564	I have been playing free MMOs.
7328604	7329864	Here are a couple and what they are.
7330644	7331364	S4 League.
7331724	7338547	This game is a third-person shooter that has anime-style graphics and these make it so you can do flips and other cool stuff like that.
7338627	7341688	And that's at S4League.com MapleStory.
7342708	7348430	You've probably heard of this one, but if you haven't, it's a platforming MMO that's kind of like Super Mario Bros., but you use weapons.
7348570	7349290	And that's at Nexon.com
7351164	7352946	Again, these are all free and really fun.
7353426	7353927	Thanks, guys.
7353967	7354708	Keep up the great work.
7354828	7359193	This email is brought to you by my Wii, PS2, GameCube, and any other system that I don't want anymore.
7359693	7363597	Homes to the never-ending dust that collects on them because they're outdated and my parents don't let me trade them in.
7365259	7365539	Wow.
7366761	7367201	Alrighty.
7368102	7370805	I also do have to commend you on your...
7372225	7374206	Fairly decent sentence structure and grammar.
7374466	7375826	Gold star for this listener.
7375987	7377187	You get a smiley face.
7378027	7384970	By the way, Rob D, I was snickering during that email because I read this comment in chat from Rob D talking about Penn & Teller's Final Fantasy XI bullshit.
7385650	7388151	He says, wait, so you want Final Fantasy Desert Bus?
7391553	7392233	Dude, you know what?
7392533	7398755	Sometimes running from one end of the map to the other when you're not a high enough level to have a chocobo feels like playing Desert Bus.
7398835	7399936	I'm not even fucking with you.
7401491	7407853	You know what my whole thing was when I did play the game and was too low to actually make it across the desert without dying?
7408253	7408973	I skirted the wall.
7411274	7413215	I was doing maze business.
7413335	7414195	That's what you have to do.
7414215	7415816	You skirt the wall and you hide.
7416416	7417876	Like, oh my god, it's going to kill me.
7418137	7419017	Okay, last one.
7419657	7419957	Ready?
7420777	7421238	Okay.
7421338	7424579	Dun, dun, dun, from J-Rod, who originated that joke.
7426399	7427400	So we have to give him props.
7428040	7428380	Props.
7428973	7429894	Hi, OLR.
7430474	7435157	Well, I've been waiting all year for TNA Impact to come out, and now it's finally released.
7435197	7436918	I see nothing but terrible reviews for it.
7437299	7442162	Bad grapple system, only five slots for creative wrestlers, only a handful of moves, and so on.
7442682	7447546	I really hope the other games I'm looking forward to this year, Dead Space and Silent Hill Homecoming, don't suck.
7447886	7449887	How can a Silent Hill game suck, okay?
7450628	7456452	So I'd like to ask, what was the biggest disappointment that you guys ever had to face with games you were highly anticipating?
7456912	7460576	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Neverending Salads and Breadsticks.
7462058	7465742	You know, I have to say, one of the first ones that jumps into my mind was Nintendogs.
7466362	7467003	I hate to say it.
7467023	7473891	It's not that Nintendogs is a bad game, but I just got so hyped for it at E3 that the bar got set so high that the game just couldn't live up to it.
7474271	7474872	It really couldn't.
7476113	7476473	I tried.
7479048	7488355	I remember one time Dan and I, this is when Dan and I were playing a lot of wrestling games and we rented at the time WWF, or was it?
7489502	7489922	Rumble Roses
7514505	7515526	Rumble Roses was great.
7515946	7521309	But at any rate, Dan and I decided that we were going to rent the... No, it was Thunder.
7521369	7521949	That was it.
7522109	7523510	I think it was WCW Thunder.
7523990	7534496	We rented it, got it home, played it for 10 minutes, and called the Hollywood or blockbuster that we got it from and took it back.
7535256	7536577	And they let us take out another game.
7538024	7538864	It was that bad.
7539245	7544848	I just remember that that has been the one... Even Spice World didn't disappoint me that badly.
7545368	7547409	At least you knew what you were going to get with Spice World.
7547569	7548410	Yeah, shice.
7550531	7553652	I got a night of endless laughs with Spice World.
7554313	7556114	I guess we were drunk, but it was really funny.
7556714	7559275	There is one game that disappointed me, but it was Japanese release only.
7559295	7560136	It was Super Producers.
7564042	7566604	Super Producers was a game where you manage a pop idol's career.
7567564	7572128	And it just disappointed me because it was a lot more language intense than I was prepared for.
7575010	7584937	Gears of War, Halo 3, Bullet Witch, and... Oh, there's one more, I know it.
7585518	7585638	Um...
7587521	7588042	Halo 3 Halo 2.5
7605688	7625176	Rob D in chat says Mega Man X5 disappointed me a lot more recently that Infinite Undiscovery although I'm hearing if you can get past the first couple hours that suck it gets a lot better so I'm trying to force myself to play it more but now I have Rock Band I just won't play Rock Band all day
7627099	7627359	All right.
7628200	7629360	And no other emails then, huh?
7629820	7630000	Nope.
7630120	7634682	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you have some mail you would like to contribute for next week's show.
7634963	7637684	In the meantime, a little more gaming news and then the Skype line.
7638124	7638344	Yes.
7639425	7642446	There's a couple hacking and cracking stories we have.
7643386	7652531	The first one is a modification someone made using the Xbox 360 Messenger kit, and they turned it into a keyboard for the PSP.
7653391	7653551	N.E.S.
7653671	7654092	into a toaster
7674972	7675512	and why?
7675932	7676933	Because it's funny.
7677153	7677513	Wait, wait, wait.
7677553	7681134	They made a Nintendo out of a toaster or they turned a Nintendo into a toaster?
7681534	7685236	They have a toaster and they put a Nintendo inside of it.
7685356	7685656	Okay.
7686616	7691078	And it actually has apparently some LED lights in the case that light up.
7693139	7696700	I'm not sure if it lights up red like it's cooking because that would be pretty funny.
7697400	7699681	But yeah, NES toaster.
7704707	7708928	The National Science Foundation gave $100,000 to do a study for World of Warcraft
7732352	7733133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7755716	7756316	Kind of interesting.
7756356	7760358	Here's a quote from the study or from the lady involved with the study.
7772501	7774181	At least they mentioned them in more interviews.
7774261	7779002	They talked more about color schemes, animations, architecture, and so on, more than American players.
7779782	7784983	She goes on to say that the Chinese players, they actually don't really play with add-ons and modifications.
7785043	7789784	They like the challenge of the core game, whereas in America we like to mod our game to hell.
7790684	7791524	Kind of interesting.
7791564	7794245	She's getting paid $100,000 to finish this research.
7794865	7802106	She's doing it along with a student going after their doctoral, and will be doing some type of final paper that I'm sure will be published all over the internet when it's done.
7803815	7805195	$100,000 to study WoW.
7807096	7808736	You can really get a job doing anything.
7808916	7810377	No, I guess that's neat.
7810537	7812397	It's just kind of like, wow, there's a lot.
7812437	7815778	But then you think about the complex layers, I guess there is a lot to study.
7815818	7819679	But I'm just kind of curious, what will be contributed to society from the results?
7819739	7822300	Is it a way for us to better understand each other through games?
7823780	7825661	Why don't people just actually socially interact?
7825721	7827081	Oh, that's right, because people are scary.
7827361	7827662	Yeah.
7828862	7829882	People are scary!
7831343	7832883	Well, how about some more news?
7834209	7834609	How about it?
7834629	7835830	Would that make you giddy, Rob?
7836331	7836571	Yes.
7837031	7847539	Well, speaking, because we did have an email earlier regarding... Warhammer?
7848039	7848219	No.
7848800	7848900	Oh.
7849640	7849961	Sorry.
7850641	7852563	I stopped working.
7853563	7854424	Yeah, it was Warhammer.
7854444	7854644	Sorry.
7857301	7865487	There was an announcement put out that there are actually server types and server names for Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning.
7865947	7872732	There's a core open RVR, which is Realm vs. Realm, roleplay, and roleplay slash open RVR.
7873312	7874233	So that's pretty cool.
7875514	7884339	It's going to have the standard gameplay, but you've got unrestricted PvP combat on the core server.
7887622	7893425	And then on Realm vs. Realm, you have to be flagged for combat to do PvP stuff.
7895287	7899730	You can also permanently flag people on the open Realm vs. Realm servers.
7900470	7904793	And of course, roleplay servers are basically getting into your character, roleplaying.
7905273	7905734	We know this.
7907225	7934225	which hopefully they actually enforce unlike in WoW I mean I guess you can file tickets in WoW but it seems like you always get a bunch of a-holes on there and they're like haha RP and it's like dude you signed up for an RP server what the F were you expecting I know right I've done a roleplay server before for World of Warcraft I had a lot of fun I played a real bitch like that's you know any different that's not roleplaying Jamie that's real life you see this ferret I do
7936448	7937128	BendOverRob.
7938850	7939070	No.
7939150	7939590	No ferrets.
7940831	7946234	But anyway, those are the type of servers that are out, so that's pretty cool.
7948396	7950817	And I don't know which one I'm playing on yet, if I get the game.
7951038	7951138	If.
7951998	7952098	If.
7953199	7953299	If.
7955280	7955581	Sorry.
7956441	7964867	I was fascinated by the fact that apparently they changed the name of Africa in Japan to Hakuna Matata.
7964887	7965367	Yeah.
7966172	7966412	Akuna Matata
7996946	7998167	I'm seriously thinking about buying this though.
7998187	8000208	That is the fucking raddest name for a game ever though.
8000348	8001268	It's only $54.90.
8001548	8001888	Really?
8002589	8004650	But it's coming out here eventually, right?
8004950	8006851	Eventually, but I don't know.
8007711	8008771	I like things I can get early.
8009432	8009732	Whatever.
8009812	8011252	Anyways, back on topic here.
8012272	8013073	Bioshock.
8013553	8015133	It's a PS3 game now.
8015253	8016994	At least it will be in October.
8017794	8021395	And as with most PS3 games, it will require an install.
8021875	8027957	But don't worry, that'll be an entertaining 10 minutes as you watch Rapture-related advertisements and music.
8030663	8031183	Very nice.
8031203	8031563	Thanks.
8031603	8033564	He found his aroma like a certain appeal.
8033584	8037245	He could clear the savannah after every meal.
8037285	8043767	I'm a sensitive soul, though I sing thick skinned.
8060811	8063252	I wonder if this game is in English.
8063492	8065172	Is it too much to get the freaking chorus?
8072734	8078535	I just wanted the freaking chorus, but the little samples on iTunes have the little chorus pre-verses there.
8079595	8079835	Lame.
8081755	8084556	Hakuna Matata.
8086656	8087797	Hakuna Matata.
8088357	8089177	Hey, Harry Potter!
8090438	8095040	Hakuna Matata, Harry Potter What do they have to do with each other, Rob?
8109306	8112889	and instead they're getting Twilight out in the movie theaters this Christmas.
8113629	8115370	But Harry Potter got pushed back to next summer.
8115430	8119613	Well, this should be kind of a duh, but the game got pushed back as well.
8119633	8125077	That's right, EA confirmed this week that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the game has been delayed.
8125357	8130180	And even though I would think the game is pretty much done, but maybe they'll take some time to go back and tweak it.
8130981	8137265	What's kind of sad about this, though, is that EA now is not going to get the profits from this game until their next fiscal quarter.
8137645	8138446	That's a loss.
8139366	8139647	Oops.
8141728	8147931	So, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will be out in video game form when the movie comes out summer 2009.
8148712	8150693	And I'm sure a lot of you kids can't wait.
8151473	8152854	Are we getting a Twilight video game?
8154155	8154295	No.
8154315	8154955	That's what I want to know.
8155456	8155676	No?
8156276	8157196	Where's that tie in?
8158697	8163380	It's, uh... I want my sparkling vampires in a video game.
8163440	8163880	Come on.
8164701	8165841	Vampires that sparkle?
8167622	8168363	That's too cool.
8168857	8175164	Hey, our Skype line's open at Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8175824	8177826	Real quickly, though, some last-minute stories.
8178527	8181350	Loki, I know you had something about EA and Take-Two, right?
8181690	8182091	Yes.
8182471	8183612	The final nail in the coffin.
8183652	8184673	Breaking news.
8185094	8187877	EA gives up on Take-Two acquisition.
8188137	8188758	It's official.
8190165	8191865	They will not buy them out.
8208170	8212091	of other due diligence materials provided by Take-Two.
8212251	8218273	EA has decided not to make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions with Take-Two.
8218633	8224755	Really, could it be all those times that they said, no, no, no, stop bothering me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
8225455	8228576	Maybe it just took them going, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
8229176	8229796	I can't see you.
8229876	8230457	I can't hear you.
8230537	8231877	La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
8234321	8236502	Skyblind's open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8236562	8238783	His name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8238823	8240104	We're going to take some calls.
8241564	8242185	We'll start here.
8242305	8243405	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8243425	8243786	Who's this?
8244966	8245686	My name is Zaku.
8246067	8246947	Hey, Zaku.
8246987	8247847	What's on your mind, my friend?
8249188	8249748	Not much.
8249868	8251869	Just chilling on a boring Sunday night.
8252209	8253190	Except for you guys.
8253210	8254310	We're just making it all better.
8254611	8255051	Thank you.
8255111	8258292	Hey, are you getting DDRX this week?
8258673	8259393	You're a Ditter fan.
8260782	8273188	Well, I'm on a wait-and-see right now, and since I'm unemployed and I need work right now, I need to hold off on spending splurging money on luxuries such as video games.
8273308	8274889	Well, that's definitely understandable.
8275670	8278931	Yeah, you know the location test happened last week, right?
8279452	8281873	Actually, throughout the better part of last week.
8281953	8282713	It just ended today.
8283514	8284114	Oh, yeah?
8284154	8284614	How'd that go?
8285835	8285855	I...
8286567	8293952	Dude, from what I've known, from what those folks were able to test out there, it's shaping up to be a pretty good mix.
8294571	8296012	Now, I have a real quick question.
8296092	8298613	DDRX, isn't that supposed to be coming out soon in the arcades?
8298653	8298833	Yeah.
8298853	8301615	I mean, they tested the arcade machine.
8301635	8302535	Yeah, that's what they were testing.
8302875	8303255	Exactly.
8303375	8303536	Okay.
8304096	8305637	Rob, you remember that... What?
8306437	8309879	You went into that store Gamers Empire with me, remember, by the Folsom Theatres?
8309899	8312040	I didn't go into it, but I... You know of it, yeah.
8312060	8312620	I know of it, yeah.
8312640	8320644	They're converting the front of their store into an arcade now, and they have told me that they are probably going to get DDRX.
8321665	8321865	Well...
8322557	8323237	That'll be fucking awesome.
8323257	8326858	It all depends on whether or not they just buy the full cab or the upgrade kit.
8327058	8329579	It's gonna be the full freaking cabinet.
8329619	8330819	They said it's really expensive.
8331899	8335040	Remember, that cab that was used in the location test is not final.
8335100	8338041	It's kind of like a prototype right now.
8338081	8342502	It's basically a test pad for what Konami's trying to do.
8343522	8345363	According to what the rep said over there.
8346283	8347403	And they're ditching Betsy.
8348063	8351364	Which is great news since now Konami's restarting their arcade division.
8352478	8353778	Oh, I didn't know they were restarting it.
8353798	8354399	That's pretty cool.
8354899	8365682	Yeah, because that's what the, you know, the folks, the guys who were running the test, you know, the folks in the arcade, you know, Konami's arcade division, that's what they were telling the folks who were at the test.
8366422	8366822	Nice.
8367062	8368102	They said we're starting over.
8368402	8369283	We are starting over.
8370003	8370783	Yes, indeed.
8370843	8372063	Yes, and that's how they mean it.
8372543	8375424	Does this mean we might get Silent Hill arcade game over here finally?
8376485	8378105	Well, if it means that no, you know,
8378962	8389470	Unfortunately, we won't have that American incompetence holding back certain, you know, basically tainting the good name of DDR with shitty cabs and just piss poor service.
8390131	8393914	It means that Konami is actually doing something right.
8393934	8395695	They're actually doing it themselves this time.
8397857	8400759	Well, any other thoughts, Zaku, on your mind before we get to another call?
8401825	8407647	Um, just the fact that Securom and EA is just killing PC gaming.
8408488	8411689	Ah, yes, the whole DRM.
8411729	8414550	I'm sure you can't run away from this discussion somewhere on the internet.
8414590	8419972	We were just talking about it with Bobby on his show a little bit when we were doing the little toss-over that he does at the end of his show.
8421032	8421713	You know, it's...
8422933	8427055	It's unfortunate that the people who are actually selling out the money to get the games are the ones that are getting punished.
8427095	8437100	See, I was going to buy Command & Conquer, you know, I was going to buy Red Alert 3 until I found out that it was basically boiled down to something almost akin to a rental.
8437641	8448727	And that's something I'm not cool with because I don't want to be, you know, first and foremost, there's no way I'm going to be treated as a criminal first and then have to prove my innocence.
8448767	8449207	It's not the...
8450489	8454191	You know, it's innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.
8454911	8460634	It does make me wish that the game would come out on consoles, you know, because it's sad for PC gamers.
8460934	8464316	I would want to use my keyboard and mouse instead of the controller.
8465376	8469158	Technically you can use the keyboard on 360, it's just there's really only one game that necessitates it.
8469178	8470979	Will the game support those two peripherals?
8470999	8471880	That's what I want to know.
8472220	8472680	I wish it would.
8472740	8476522	If not, then I might as well just skip it until they ditch the...
8477462	8481145	and the protections on the PC version, which is the one I wanted to buy in the first place.
8481846	8488652	It just sucks it had to be like that, but hopefully we'll hit EA where it hurts, in their wallets.
8489312	8490133	We'll see what happens.
8490213	8492455	Alright, Sakura, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one, okay?
8493374	8494015	All right, you too.
8494035	8494295	Take care.
8517990	8521332	Are you currently a Warcraft player that's considering leaving for Warhammer?
8521372	8523113	Here's some of the responses we got via Twitter.
8523653	8527676	GS68 says, I don't play MMOs, except the real occasional Albatross 18.
8528756	8530637	And I apologize if I mispronounce your names, guys.
8531218	8534099	Dustoise says, I'm actually waiting for Champions Online.
8534139	8537341	I love City of Heroes villains and would love an updated, better version of that.
8538141	8541003	Tiara says, nope, still waiting patiently for Star Trek Online.
8542644	8545386	Peker Uno says, simply, hell no.
8546486	8548268	Dark Tetsuya says, I'm just waiting for Diablo 3.
8549129	8550670	DJ Tyrant says, no and no.
8550750	8554914	I've seen the war beta and it looks very similar to WoW and I'm not a huge PvP player.
8555294	8556315	If I were, I might leave.
8557536	8562020	Giavdea, sorry if I mispronounced that name, says, I'm waiting for Guild Wars 2.
8563297	8567779	Misty OLR says, yeah, I'm with GS68, who said I don't play MMOs, 100% on this one.
8568120	8569981	My damn attention span doesn't help things either.
8570621	8572362	Quiltipo says, will there be bards?
8572842	8575284	If so, yes, give me a damn bard already, people.
8575724	8579186	I hate to say it, but Fafixi has bards, and it's actually a pretty awesome class to play.
8580066	8585329	Actdeft says, considering that I was never into MMOs, Warhammer, even though it looks good, I won't be picking it up.
8585749	8587871	MMOs are never-ending repeat cycles.
8588491	8590873	Meowfrog says, I'm not buying Warhammer.
8591013	8591833	I may later on.
8591933	8593415	However, I do still play WoW.
8593715	8596016	I have friends who have canceled their account for Warhammer.
8596196	8597778	I actually know people that have done the same thing.
8598078	8603081	We used to do a big rating alliance to do the 25 mans, and a bunch of them have quit to go to Warhammer.
8603241	8603682	Something else.
8604262	8606083	Lastly, here's another one I'll probably mispronounce.
8606644	8609626	Spongetwang says, not buying Warhammer online.
8609946	8614450	currently playing WoW sparingly as is, using spare and spare time for DDR.
8614831	8620236	So I'd like to point out, out of those 12 responses, not a single person said they're buying Warhammer.
8621197	8621617	Uh-oh.
8621677	8626542	But we did have people saying that their friends are getting it, so maybe it's not going to be a huge game.
8627743	8630926	And certainly we have a very unscientific sample, but there you go.
8631837	8633738	Geovay Day Paradox Vincent
8657508	8658208	Well, not much.
8658248	8664190	I just wanted to give a big shout out to you guys for playing I'm Having Trouble Beating Airman from Mario Payne.
8664230	8665130	I really liked that.
8665310	8666790	Yeah, I'm pretty much obsessed with that song.
8666810	8667151	I don't know.
8667171	8667311	I just...
8685520	8698007	Well, I found it on YouTube a really long time ago, and I just kept listening to it and kept listening to it, and it's just a nice little Japanese rock song from some Japanese indie band.
8698227	8701148	And it's about Mega Man, and I can't go wrong with that.
8702009	8704410	It sounds like you could go in a Mega Man game, though, right?
8706071	8706751	Maybe Mega Man 10.
8707091	8712794	They should have a best-of, Mega Man All-Stars, as the best monsters from all the games.
8712834	8714675	Do you like watching the videos that they make for these?
8718444	8719124	I don't know if you heard that.
8719164	8721345	Do you like watching the videos that they make from these?
8722965	8723566	Oh, yeah.
8723906	8725386	Yeah, that's my favorite part.
8725746	8728907	That's one of my favorite parts of those, the little videos.
8728967	8735229	I don't exactly know if they just hand animated them or if they're all pixeled, but yeah, that's one of my favorite parts about it.
8736750	8737130	All right.
8738050	8738890	Well, very cool.
8739110	8740731	Anything else you've been playing lately?
8740771	8741571	Oh, and... Yeah.
8742291	8744112	Yeah, actually, well, I mean...
8744662	8747283	I haven't really been playing it, but... Well, I guess I have.
8747343	8753444	A few weeks ago, I went over to a party, and I really started playing on my friend's PS3.
8753704	8763026	And I used to really bash the PS3, but, you know, lately... And he sat me down, and... Can I do a really quick plug here?
8764146	8764466	Sure.
8766447	8769007	It's my friend's website.
8769667	8771468	His name is Frank Castle, and he's...
8772897	8776960	He runs this community called Arizona Hobbyist Paradise.
8777280	8777480	What?
8777740	8778941	He's not the Punisher, is he?
8780542	8782643	Yeah.
8785185	8786525	Frank Castle is the Punisher's name.
8786806	8787026	Nice.
8787406	8790088	Alright, so he runs a comic thing in Arizona?
8791649	8798433	Yeah, well it's called Arizona Hobbyist Paradise and it's at hobbyistparadise.com
8800959	8830423	and it's just for like AZ Arizona people who like gaming, anime and comics but I was playing on his PS3 and then he sat me down and then he's like you know the PS3 is starting to really gain a lot of ground in the gaming industry and I obviously disagreed with him but then he showed me this big list and I mean I'm looking at the PS3 exclusives right now and it used to kind of be like the big joke of gaming but I'm really thinking about picking up a PS3 really soon
8831289	8836773	I do want one for LittleBigPlanet and Home definitely has me curious, but I think Sony still has a long way to go.
8837373	8840395	And that's kind of been a theme with them lately, and that's kind of worrisome.
8840455	8848460	They were allowed to do a little bit of a slow launch with the PlayStation 2 because it was really the only thing out there, if I remember right, when it first came out.
8849040	8856145	But with the PSP, there wasn't a lot of must-have games on the PSP, and a lot of those patches that enabled the internet and all those things came out
8856505	8858726	I'm wondering have you ever heard of The Last Guy?
8879800	8881001	Um, no.
8881021	8884203	Yeah, it's the last guy that's that one that was like that game in Work Time Fun.
8884964	8888126	The one where it uses like the Google Map-esque stuff.
8888146	8891107	Oh, okay, yeah, I think I remember hearing about this on a previous show, yeah.
8892708	8897832	And also, uh, Pain, Pain looked pretty, it looked interesting.
8898492	8901134	Uh, I hear it's a little silly, but okay, I mean, it's different.
8903513	8911736	and I just think that, and Pain, if I'm not mistaken, isn't that a title that you buy on the PlayStation Network?
8911936	8912696	Yes, it is.
8912836	8917097	That's one of those games I think that you can now get on your PSP as well through the whole little... No.
8917478	8918078	No, it's not?
8918098	8918138	No.
8918258	8918798	I thought it was.
8919478	8923940	Because you know how some of those PlayStation Network games are coming on the PSP, like Flow was one of them, I know?
8924840	8925180	Yeah.
8925200	8925760	That's interesting.
8926540	8926841	Yeah.
8927021	8927581	Echo Chrome?
8927961	8928581	Yeah.
8929221	8931142	All right, well, anything else, Paradox Vincent, before we let you go?
8933308	8934550	I'm not all that much.
8934910	8935171	All right.
8935191	8935951	Well, have a good one, buddy.
8937313	8937654	You too.
8937674	8938214	Thanks for listening.
8938234	8939676	Next time I see you, I'll break your arms.
8940457	8941038	Oh, ow.
8941619	8942339	Why would you do that?
8942420	8942900	That's mean.
8944342	8945203	Zongief would do it.
8945443	8945864	Oh, okay.
8947796	8949297	Why would someone threaten to break my arms?
8949597	8952518	Now if my arms really do get broken, I have it on tape and I can sue.
8953038	8953298	Alright.
8954499	8960061	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8960181	8962422	We've got time for maybe like one more call, I think.
8962922	8963742	We'll probably do tonight.
8965043	8965303	Alright.
8966843	8967904	Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8967924	8968284	Who's this?
8969364	8971485	Hi, it's SSJ100 Matt from New York.
8971565	8973366	Well, hello SSJ100 Matt from New York.
8973406	8973786	How are you?
8974850	8975511	I'm good, thanks.
8975631	8977092	I was just thinking the other day.
8977472	8978613	I miss New York City.
8980274	8981155	You should definitely come.
8981395	8982596	I want to come back and visit.
8982636	8986880	I just don't know when I'm realistically going to make it happen because I'm very likely taking two trips to LA.
8987220	8993064	There is a very small chance I might be able to pull through and do BlizzCon after all, but more on that when I find out for sure.
8993084	8993825	I don't want to jinx it.
8994626	8996007	So, we'll see.
8997208	8997868	What's on your mind, buddy?
8998769	9002712	Well, first off, I wanted to profess my love to Castle Crashers.
9004853	9007977	I think everyone who has a 360 needs to get it now.
9008198	9009960	What is it about Castle Crashers that you love?
9009980	9011182	I don't know.
9011242	9015328	It just brings back my old love of the classic beat-em-ups like Turtles in Time.
9015909	9016890	I'm not saying it's like that.
9016910	9017792	Turtles in Time is great.
9017872	9019234	It just reminds me of that.
9020258	9031405	I don't know though, the demo kind of got a little old for me, but I do like, I mean, I need to get the full version I think, because it does look like the little other aspects of upgrades and roleplay-esque elements they put in there look kind of cool.
9031965	9036188	I didn't want to review the game based off a demo alone, especially when everybody else is saying such wonderful things about it.
9036688	9040970	Also, I've been playing the game by myself, and I imagine it's the type of game that's much more fun with more people.
9041291	9042451	But I hear online is broken.
9043772	9044633	Yeah, online's broken.
9044673	9046814	You know what, I haven't really been playing online, um,
9047270	9049291	Mostly my friends have been bugging me to come play.
9049311	9053374	I'm actually getting texted right now asking to come over and play it.
9055715	9064701	But yeah, you know, it's lots of fun, and it's kind of a good party game if you kind of have a group of people who are all about it.
9066007	9066608	Sure, sure.
9066948	9069490	And Rob D kind of sums up what I'm thinking.
9069530	9070311	He's in the chat right now.
9070331	9073994	He says, I'm enjoying Castle Crashers, but I'm not really digging the combat gameplay.
9074114	9078238	I do like the art style and the music, but I'm not liking the characters or the attacking.
9078278	9084904	Yeah, I mean, the game's got a certain quirkiness about it that's very cool that piques my interest, but I don't know.
9084924	9084984	The...
9086065	9090247	Old School Ninja Turtles Arcade Game gameplay kind of got old a little while ago.
9090347	9091007	Well, I don't know.
9091067	9092168	Maybe it's not completely fair to say.
9092188	9093548	I think it's just one of these more fun and big groups.
9093568	9095229	It got old when you wasted all your quarters on it.
9095429	9096830	Yeah, true, true, very true.
9099431	9103573	No, the other thing I wanted to talk about is, you guys kind of mentioned this before, is NHL 09.
9104413	9104593	Yes.
9105954	9110576	And I managed to pick that up yesterday and I, you know what, I'm a big hockey fan.
9111016	9113998	If anyone listens to Under Sedation Live, I was calling about that.
9114398	9114598	But,
9117437	9123479	No, I think this is, you know, one of the better hockey games because of the whole online interaction that they have.
9124060	9126040	What's so special about the online interaction, real quick?
9126301	9143828	Well, basically what it is, they kind of made hockey into an MMO where you create a player and you can take him on to a custom team where, you know, you can have a bunch of friends or like what we have with...
9144804	9152467	All games, we've decided to make an all games team.
9152927	9155869	Does everybody play as one character on the team, or how does it work?
9156649	9159830	You play as one position on the team, or player.
9160331	9163512	So you can either play goalie, you can play center, you can play any position.
9164332	9166873	You can all play at once, and it's lots of fun.
9168574	9171755	So yeah, we're trying to rally every show...
9173942	9175103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9196795	9197395	NHL 09 Online
9222110	9222570	Very cool.
9223170	9224371	All right, well, we've got to let you go.
9224491	9226772	We're going to start to wrap things up, but thanks so much for your call, okay?
9226792	9227572	Yep.
9227812	9228452	All right, take care, buddy.
9230933	9231453	Very cool.
9231713	9237335	Wow, I think we've talked more about sports games tonight than we have in a year on Orange Lounge Radio, but that's okay.
9237375	9239996	We want to give an equal opportunity to all games.
9241156	9241657	Let's see.
9241777	9244998	We're going to wrap things up here, but I did get a private message I wanted to read here.
9245058	9245958	James Patrick says...
9246378	9247519	Dragon Quest IV Dragon Quest V
9270316	9270957	Rob cheated.
9271017	9271477	I did not cheat.
9271497	9271778	I'm kidding.
9271798	9272018	I had help.
9291417	9293038	It was officially sanctioned.
9293458	9302702	It wasn't one of those things where, like, for a while, if you bought the game, you got the stupid thing free, the guidebook, which I always thought was a little weird, but I'm pretty sure you did through, like, Nintendo Power or something.
9303723	9305904	Um... It's been a long time.
9306764	9307885	Yeah, I don't know.
9308185	9311486	I didn't even try Dragon Quest VIII.
9311526	9312387	It was cool!
9312447	9313767	Dragon Quest VIII is actually really fun.
9313787	9314788	I want to go back and beat it.
9314908	9316249	It was actually a lot, a lot of fun.
9317069	9320130	It was like an old-school Super Nintendo role-playing game, but with, like, 3D graphics.
9320991	9321151	Yeah.
9322304	9322625	I don't know.
9324408	9325910	It's not my thing, I guess.
9326051	9329316	I don't know, I still have to go back and finish Lost Odyssey, so, I mean, shit.
9329857	9332843	I am not buying any more RPGs until I finish Lost Odyssey.
9334195	9335296	So it may be a while.
9335776	9344662	In all these Square Enix offshoot games, like Last Remnant and Infinite Undiscovery, I don't know if I should even try those.
9344982	9351186	You know, I'm being persuaded by a listener that Infinite Undiscovery may not be as bad as the first two hours make it seem.
9351206	9354288	But boy, what a crappy way to start the game is just running from things.
9354428	9356710	It's just kind of frustrating.
9356730	9357531	But I'm going to try to...
9358391	9362854	Try to suck it up and try to get a little further because I like the part that I played at Penny Arcade Expo and that bugged me.
9363095	9364636	Why isn't the game as cool as I remember?
9365016	9367398	Was it just that whole con?
9368018	9372322	You know how games always seem better at a con because you're caught up in the moment of a convention?
9372722	9374824	I don't know if this is exactly a good...
9375965	9380788	I like Final Fantasy VIII, it was alright Like I can get on the internet
9406214	9412456	So, in case you were wondering if Rock Revolution for the Wii is going to be good, apparently it's not.
9413397	9415217	Just, you know, throwing it out there.
9415857	9429922	Kotaku actually got to preview the game at a Nintendo party last Friday, and apparently the game itself on the Wii, there is no peripheral support whatsoever, even if you happen to do own...
9430422	9431182	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9460362	9460662	I don't know.
9461022	9462082	So that's kind of lame.
9463103	9468784	And of course, kind of on the topic of Nintendo here, they will not be at E4ALL.
9469744	9473545	And yeah, apparently they just didn't want to go.
9473625	9475265	It's not in their plans.
9475925	9483007	I do remember if I heard correctly that they're going to be showing off their games there anyways at like some Target booth or something.
9483047	9486388	I guess they actually sell games at this expo, which is weird.
9487668	9501972	and Namco Bandai has said that they're planning on making more Xbox Live Arcade remakes of classic arcade games, much like they've done with Pac-Man Championship Edition and Galaga Legions.
9502832	9506413	No word on exactly what they're planning, but more games.
9508494	9513896	One suggestion, I guess, says that the team is working on a Pole Position remake, which is interesting.
9514496	9518698	And this little bit, I thought I'd throw this out for you, Rob.
9518918	9526121	It's not exactly news, but there's a Dreamcast console available on PlayAsia.com that's the Hello Kitty Special Edition.
9526361	9526901	Yay!
9527022	9528522	I've actually seen that in a store before.
9528802	9529483	It's been out a while.
9529743	9529923	Yeah.
9530943	9531804	But they're hard to find.
9531884	9532744	Really, really hard to find.
9532764	9533224	Yeah.
9533844	9534725	So, that's it.
9535430	9538192	Team Ico is revealing a new game, The Queen, apparently.
9564151	9564792	The Queen of what?
9565092	9565352	England?
9565712	9566613	It's just called The Queen.
9566693	9567014	France?
9567654	9571998	It says Tokyo Game Show teaser website calls the game Ico 3 The Queen.
9573859	9574200	Alright.
9574580	9576301	Which begs the question what was Ico 2?
9579428	9604810	I don't remember a night go to maybe Shadow of the Colossus I don't know but apparently it's going to be Tokyo Game Show so that's kind of exciting and also my final thought is that I got to the bottom of why those Rock Band drum sets weren't out there apparently they released a press release on the 10th saying that they're coming later in the week I somehow missed that so that'd be why no one has them yet
9608630	9615559	My final thought for those of you in chatroom discussing this game right now is it's Treasure Hunter, not a thief.
9617286	9618706	All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.
9618906	9621147	We're going to wrap up and get on out of here.
