0	19920	Today, September 14th, 2008, could a Wii storage problem solution finally be coming?
19920	24960	The Mortal Kombat vs. DC roster leaks thanks to its achievements, and the first details
24960	27000	emerge on DJ Hero.
27000	35400	Hello, everybody out there on the internets, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35400	36400	Radio.
36400	40800	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
40800	41800	lifestyle.
41800	46800	It's where every gamer has a voice, including you guys when you join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
46800	50760	But the voices you'll probably hear most are myself, Rob Roberts, and with me as always,
50760	52720	the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
52720	53720	Hi.
53720	55360	How you doing, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?
55360	56360	I'm here.
56360	57360	Almost like your new name.
57360	58360	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?
58360	59360	Not really, though.
59360	60720	Um, just don't call me Bob.
60720	61720	Okay, Bob.
61720	63360	All right, also joining us tonight.
63360	65280	You know what, Rob?
65280	69000	Returning after being on vacation last week, I don't know who told him he could take a
69000	73720	week off, but apparently he took it upon himself to take a week off after being so exhausted
73720	75920	from Penny Arcade Expo, it's Techmaster Loki.
75920	76920	Hey.
76920	77920	So what was it?
77920	78920	The day job kept you away, right?
78920	79920	Yeah.
79920	80920	I had to go to San Francisco.
80920	82000	Oh, you poor thing.
82000	85040	You had to get bought fancy dinners by the company, I'm sure, huh?
85040	86040	Yes.
86040	87240	You poor, poor thing.
87240	88520	Any game-related things you saw?
88520	91480	Oh, you probably can't talk about them, even if you did, huh?
91480	92480	I, no.
92480	98080	I didn't, I, no, everything there is just, like, like company-related stuff.
98080	103760	They, I mean, they mentioned a few, like, release seats for movies that, you know, I
103760	104760	don't know.
104760	105760	But nothing.
105760	106760	But nothing.
106760	107760	There's no game stuff.
107760	110360	They, they just, like, oh yeah, I'm gonna do a game soon.
110360	112080	It's more of an afterthought.
112080	113080	It's all movie stuff.
113080	114080	A little bit.
114080	117000	I gave everyone a $1,500 trip to one of ten locations.
117000	119000	Oh, poor thing.
119000	122520	Well, that's just $1,500.
122520	127880	You have to book your own trip, so that may cover your flight, and that's about it.
127880	130080	We could go to, what, Fresno?
130080	131080	On that?
131080	132080	No, it's one of ten locations.
132080	140240	So it's either Hawaii, Hollywood, Seattle, somewhere in Arizona, I forget what it was.
140240	142160	Can you save it for next year and go to Seattle next year?
142160	144200	By the end of 2009.
144200	146280	And no, I'm not going to PAX next year for that.
146280	149320	I'm not using it for PAX, no.
149320	157640	There's San Antonio, Chicago, Boston, New York City, and Orlando.
157640	158960	So lots, lots of neat places.
158960	159960	Oh, and Hawaii.
159960	161560	You said Hawaii.
161560	163600	Stop rubbing it in.
163600	168000	And then I found out the other day, because this was originally only being offered to
168000	179280	our movie sales, we're going to be probably getting a 42-inch Sony Bravia Plasma TV through
179280	180280	some deal.
180280	184480	Basically, our video reps are selling some Sony product, and the goals seem reasonable,
184480	187080	so probably by Christmas, I'll have another TV.
187080	189600	Let me know when they're hiring, okay?
189600	190600	Good luck.
190600	196120	Our company, trust me, it sounds good, and if you're movie sales, you're probably making
196120	198080	out pretty good, but everyone else is not.
198080	202240	An orange job radio here on all games radio tonight.
202240	203800	All right, let's get, let's shift.
203800	204800	But, oh, wait, wait, wait.
204800	209440	I was going to say, just taking it back to the gaming, though, I did go to Japan town,
209440	216320	and I picked up a pillow shaped like a question block from Mario Brothers, so they're hanging
216320	218520	in my desk just like a question block would be.
218520	221720	They wouldn't let me hang it from the ceiling, so I had to put it under my shelf.
221720	225360	I was going to say, when you get frustrated, would you just go, boing, and get it?
225360	228480	Well, if I hate it, it knocks it off, but that's fine.
228480	233640	And then I also bought, because I used to do and collect Gundam figures, they had armored
233640	237680	core figures, so I picked up one of those, I'm going to build that, so that's kind of
237680	238680	cool.
238680	239680	But lots of game stuff there.
239680	242200	Now, I remember seeing at Dark Soccer's house something very similar to the question mark
242200	243200	block.
243200	246680	She has a goomba, and you can actually hit it, and it makes a little squishy sound when
246680	247680	you hit it.
247680	251640	Yes, they had a bunch of Yoshi's there, and a bunch of Yoshi eggs, but I didn't want any
251640	254400	of those, because Yoshi's like Jar Jar.
254400	255400	All right.
255400	256920	Yoshi is not Jar Jar.
256920	258880	He's the Jar Jar of the Mario World.
258880	259880	He is not.
259880	260880	Yoshi's awesome.
260880	261880	Jar Jar was Jar Jar.
261880	263200	You did not even in the same league.
263200	264200	How dare you?
264200	265200	All right.
265200	271640	Let's get into some actual video gaming, besides the whole Yoshi debate, and talk a little
271640	273680	bit about your gaming week, Dark Sakura.
273680	275880	How was your gaming week?
275880	282280	It wasn't, because I haven't had a chance to really play much other than Ragnarok.
282280	288480	But I did open my copy of The World Ends With You, and I'm going to be starting it, so that's
288480	290360	some progress, right?
290360	291360	Yes.
291360	295920	Sometimes opening the box can be a day-long chore in itself, for real, the way they wrap
295920	296920	them.
296920	297920	No, no, no, no, no.
297920	298920	I played Salamander.
298920	299920	Oh, how was that?
299920	303640	Because I picked up the Salamander pack for Dan on PSP, and it was pretty cool.
303640	304640	Very cool.
304640	305640	And, and, and, and, and.
305640	306640	And?
306640	309040	I downloaded a ROM for puzzle and dusted, so I can play it again.
309040	310920	Ah, our classic game of the week last week.
310920	311920	Yep.
311920	315200	Now, Salamander, um, was Life Force here in the US, kind of.
315200	316200	Yes.
316200	317200	Kind of.
317200	318200	Right?
318200	319200	Because it was a lot more difficult, if I remember right.
319200	320200	I think I've played the Salamander arcade game.
320200	321200	They were both pretty freaking hard.
321200	324120	But Life Force was kind of easy, from what I remember.
324120	325400	Life Force was still kind of difficult.
325400	328680	I mean, I wouldn't say it was our type hard, but it was pretty tough.
328680	331960	Didn't it have a 30 lives code or something, or at least it had the up, up, down, down,
331960	332960	like you could get all the power-ups?
332960	333960	Yeah.
333960	334960	Okay.
334960	335960	I think that made it easier.
335960	340440	GS68 wants to know, was it one or two Salamander?
340440	342200	I got the deluxe pack.
342200	343200	The first one.
343200	344200	Ah.
344200	345200	There you go.
345200	346200	The both games pack.
346200	347200	Cool.
347200	348200	Alright.
348200	349200	Loki, how was your gaming week?
349200	353320	Pretty good, because I have a lot of weeks to catch up on, but I didn't play that much.
353320	356840	I played, let's see, Mercenaries 2.
356840	362120	I got that slightly before it came out, and I've been playing it a little bit.
362120	370200	I can say, I haven't played the first Mercenaries game, but damn, number 2 is seriously broken.
370200	372400	But it's broken in an amusing way.
372400	378920	Like, for example, some of the physics in it are kind of wonky, like you can tap a tree
378920	385000	with a motorcycle and it explodes, and pretty much there's nothing you can do as far as
385000	388120	sitting in a car that's about to explode to hurt yourself.
388120	391920	I mean, if your car explodes while you happen to be in it, you'll take a little bit of damage,
391920	394060	and that's about it.
394060	398800	I was walking around an enemy camp and I hit a barbell and it kicked it like a soccer ball,
398800	403120	which is kind of funny, and then there was one part where I was playing it and I got
403120	406680	injured to the point where I was about to die, and when you die, your screen starts
406680	411680	to kind of blink red and you hear your heart beat and stuff.
411680	417840	Well, it stayed like that, and so I was invulnerable, and any vehicle I got in, I was invincible
417840	422280	in as well, until I turned the game off.
422280	423280	So that was fun.
423280	427200	And then they have a nice glitch with one of the little side missions you can do the
427200	432840	bet money on to actually make money off of, where they have a maximum where you can only
432840	440840	make $5 million per bet, but the problem is, though, is the minimum is calculated off of
440840	444880	the amount of money that you have, and the minimum doesn't have a cap to it, so you can
444880	451200	keep playing this game until you have a $50 million minimum and a maximum of $5 million,
451200	453200	so that's kind of broken, too.
453200	458840	It's just, the whole game's kind of broken, but I guess it's kind of fun.
458840	463240	Then of course, I played More Grand Theft Auto IV, I'm on a two-week winning streak
463240	471200	now with our company group, so that was fun, and I played Spore, and it's kind of boring.
471200	476120	I'm not too far into it, I'm to the tribe stage right now, but I haven't really actually
476120	482800	played the tribe stage yet, but the cell and creature stages are quite boring, and I hope
482800	488520	the rest of the game's not like that, but so far I'm very unimpressed by the graphics,
488520	491080	I'm very unimpressed by the gameplay.
491080	496080	It just looks like a game that should have been out like years ago, I don't know.
496080	503140	And then Rock Band 2, I was lucky enough to get that a little early, so I've been playing
503140	505480	quite a bit of Rock Band 2 actually.
505480	512920	We have a fellow worker at my company that plays quite a bit of Rock Band, and so he's
512920	517960	been playing it along with me, and we started a band in there, and one of the random names
517960	523360	they gave us was Unfit Barf Bags, so we stuck with it, and I made a cool logo and stuff,
523360	524720	and so we've been playing that.
524720	529920	I actually bought the Mad Catz Precision Bass that they have for it, and that controller's
529920	530920	fucking awesome.
530920	532440	It has like a little double strum.
532440	535320	Whoa, wait, did you just say Mad Catz and Awesome in the same sentence?
535320	536320	I know.
536320	537320	I know.
537320	538320	Wow.
538320	539320	Well, their Rock Band stuff's actually pretty good.
539320	540320	It really...
540320	541320	Pinch me.
541320	542320	Seriously.
542320	543320	I must be dreaming.
543320	544320	I know.
544320	548920	I mean, eventually this is bound to happen, but no, it actually is a pretty good controller.
548920	551880	What's next, a DDR mat that won't break after a week?
551880	552880	I don't know about that.
552880	553880	Surely you jest.
553880	556840	But the Rock Band stuff though, they're doing some good stuff with that.
556840	558700	I have to preface this real fast, I'm sorry.
558700	562800	If you don't know why people always kind of joke about Mad Catz and you know how all their
562800	566320	stuff is broken, like, I don't know, for me, it dates back to the days that we used to
566320	567320	cover DDR, right?
567320	570040	Like, I don't know, Dark Soccer, did you ever own a Mad Catz pad?
570040	571040	No.
571040	572040	With $20 pads?
572040	573040	Have you heard about them, Shirley?
573040	577160	I did, but I remember what I used to say, I would never buy anything knockoff.
577160	578440	Yeah, exactly.
578440	581440	And they were like the $20 dance pads, so everybody was like, yay, cheap dance pad.
581440	583280	Well, they would break after like a week.
583280	585280	They were definitely made with $20 parts.
585280	591320	At least with the Rock Band stuff, and I know that these are officially licensed products,
591320	596960	and I mean, Mad Catz is in charge of making the cymbals that are gonna be optional for
596960	598120	Rock Band 2.
598120	602460	They're the only people that are making them, and this bass is something that they're starting
602460	607800	to put out too, and it's actually put together a lot better than the controller is, the normal
607800	609480	guitar controller that you can buy.
609480	614240	So what makes it kind of unique, though, they have a thumb rest on it and a dual strummer.
614240	618720	It's split down the middle, so you can kind of strum it like you would a bass guitar.
618720	623460	The only thing I don't like about it, and I know you can't really whammy on a bass guitar,
623460	628680	but the whammy bar is no longer a bar, it's a knob, and it's literally impossible unless
628680	631720	you had a third arm to trigger it.
631720	634680	I need to interject here, because I want to do a quick poll in our chat room, because
634680	637080	I'm really, really curious about this before you finish this story.
637080	641200	All right, and this is for the longtime music game fans only, of which I know we have many
641200	644040	that listen to Orange Lawns Radio, because we've been doing this a while when we all
644040	645640	started with DDR.
645640	650320	Here's my quick poll question for chat, will you find it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz
650320	653840	if this bass guitar thing is as awesome as Loki says it is?
653840	654840	That's my quick poll.
654840	656760	Do you have it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz?
656760	660120	I also do have a comment that I don't see what the difference should be in the strum
660120	665880	bar or not, because I always play the Guitar Hero ones strumming upwards and not downwards,
665880	667960	because you play bass strumming upwards.
667960	671280	But it's so that you can hit it faster if you want to.
671280	672900	Yeah, I like that it's split in two.
672900	675240	That is kind of cool, because you can use like two fingers.
675240	676240	You walk it with your fingers on them.
676240	677240	That would take some getting used to.
677240	680440	It does take some getting used to, and it, I don't know.
680440	681440	I like it though.
681440	682440	It's really good.
682440	686880	I'll read the reviews on it if you have any qualms about buying it.
686880	692880	All the reviews have been extremely positive about it, so maybe it is a turn for the better.
692880	695520	And then, let's see what else did I play.
695520	698040	Wait, here's the results of our quick poll, all right.
698040	700080	Can you find it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz?
700080	701080	Polled it.
701080	702480	Chat.orangeawnsradio.com, here we go.
702480	703480	Fuck no.
703480	704480	No.
704480	705480	Never.
705480	706480	Nope.
706480	707480	Probably.
707480	708480	No.
708480	709480	Hell no.
709480	710480	Never.
710480	711480	I'm waiting for Hori to make a guitar con from GS68.
711480	712480	Maybe.
712480	715680	Perhaps, if the price is right, and that's because it has a better D-pad.
715680	717920	I had a Mad Catz GameCube controller, and it was crap.
717920	718920	There you go.
718920	720640	The results of the quick poll.
720640	721640	Okay.
721640	722640	Resoundingly negative.
722640	724040	I'd buy a Hori one.
724040	730840	They're also supposed to be making, later on, full wood controllers for Rock Band.
730840	732700	They're going to be actual, like, guitars.
732700	734440	So I don't know.
734440	735440	It's nice.
735440	737600	Who wants to come over to my house to play Rock Band?
737600	738600	I got wood.
738600	741800	I was going to say, does that mean you have wood?
741800	747280	The other thing I tried out were the PDP drum silencers.
747280	754440	Now, I had tried some third-party, like the Rock Band, or it's like rockbanddrumsilencer.com
754440	755440	or something like that.
755440	758800	They're really cheap-ass, you know, foam shit.
758800	762360	Well, these are the official ones that they actually sell in the stores for 20 bucks,
762360	764040	and they work pretty good.
764040	765200	I don't know.
765200	766760	Did you play drums a little bit, Rob?
766760	769880	Yeah, I played drums at your little thing when I came over.
769880	775760	Did they work pretty good, the sensitivity on them?
775760	778120	It could have been a little better, honestly.
778120	779440	Some of the pads were better than others.
779440	780720	Like, I noticed the red one.
780720	781720	I had a lot of problems.
781720	784000	That could, admittedly, it could be the way I drum.
784000	785360	I'm not used to drumming.
785360	786360	I don't claim to drum professionally.
786360	788880	It could also be my drum set, because it's a first-generation one.
788880	792280	Apparently, all the other ones, they've made more sensitive, so I don't know.
792280	794640	But I thought it worked pretty well.
794640	795640	I don't know.
795640	800080	It beats being extremely loud with those, because it bugs everything.
800080	801080	True.
801080	804400	The volume is much more manageable with the little silencers on it.
804400	805400	I don't know.
805400	810160	I was trying to find the Rock Band 2 drum sets, which were supposedly out today, and
810160	812660	apparently nobody knows that they're supposed to be out today.
812660	818320	So EA just didn't ship anybody, because I went to Gamestop, which, I might add, Gamestop
818320	822080	told me they were coming out today, and they said, oh yeah, we have some coming in for
822080	825400	our pre-order customers, but we don't know how many extras they're gonna have.
825400	828460	And then I come back to a different Gamestop, and they're all, what are you talking about?
828460	830000	They're coming out in October.
830000	831960	And I'm a liar!
831960	835320	No, he was an idiot, is what he was.
835320	839440	And I went to the Fry's, and they didn't know about it, and Best Buy said they're getting
839440	844240	them later in the week, so I'm just assuming they didn't ship anybody, which, not surprising.
844240	851620	But yeah, I need to get some of those new drums, because I want to plug in useless shit
851620	853400	to them.
853400	858320	And because my drum set will probably go to my sister eventually, so.
858320	859320	That's it.
859320	860840	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
860840	864200	Alright, my gaming week, kind of a lot of the same things that Matt's been talking about,
864200	865200	so I don't want to repeat too bad.
865200	867560	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, one more thing, sorry, sorry, sorry.
867560	869760	Castle Crashers, fucking awesome.
869760	870760	That's it.
870760	871760	Alright.
871760	875440	I've been playing mostly Spore and Rock Band 2 as well.
875440	879320	Although most of my Rock Band 2 was early, early this morning, because I went to a Walmart,
879320	881880	which I usually don't shop at Walmart, but it was the only place that was doing it at
881880	884040	midnight, so I was like, alright, I'll go.
884040	886400	So I went into Walmart and, you know, just bought it.
886400	889880	I had to wait around, because they didn't realize the game was coming out, but whatever,
889880	893520	you know, I guess they're not used to games coming out on Sunday or something, although
893520	896520	as Bobby pointed out- They're not used to working at Walmart at
896520	897520	midnight.
897520	902440	Well, no, actually, you know, I was going to try to defend them a little bit, you know,
902440	905860	Be Devil's Advocate, but you might be right, because I was actually told they can't find
905860	909440	the box right now because the guy's on break.
909440	912120	So we had to sit around and wait for the guy to get back from break.
912120	915800	So I finally got out of there about 1230 with Rock Band 2, but whatever, I got Rock Band,
915800	918800	so the hell with it.
918800	922880	So I've actually been enjoying Rock Band 1.5, as I've kind of been calling it, because a
922880	928360	lot of it feels pretty much like Rock Band 1 with a newer, better song list.
928360	931560	All the problems that you wish had been fixed in 1 are now fixed.
931560	934800	For instance, you know, you can do a band tour mode by yourself.
934800	937000	In fact, there is no more single player tour.
937000	940640	It's just all the band world tour, and you know, it's kind of fun to make a sticker and
940640	941640	stuff.
941640	942640	And the online is much more comprehensive.
942640	946520	You can do these battle of the bands where you're automatically, you know, playing against
946520	953000	your friends list in a Geometry Wars 2 stylish way of taking over their scores, and you know,
953000	956360	on these set lists that could be up for a week or a few hours.
956360	959360	It's pretty crazy.
959360	965920	So yeah, that's more rounded out online mode, but as far as like graphics and some of that,
965920	969520	like the interface hasn't really changed at all.
969520	973600	The models and everything are the exact same ones they had in Rock Band 1.
973600	975960	The motion capturing was a lot better though, I think.
975960	976960	Was it?
976960	979800	It didn't even seem that different to me, to be honest.
979800	984740	So it's a little bit Rock Band 1.5-ish to me, but then again, this is kind of where
984740	990720	we're going with music games is it's a Madden all its own now, you know, to, you know, and
990720	996560	you know, I say Rock Band 1.5 in somewhat, you know, in jest because, you know, obviously
996560	998380	we've been playing DDR for years.
998380	1001480	We're used to this crap where it's pretty much the same game with new songs.
1001480	1006360	But seriously though, if the best feature I think in this game is actually something
1006360	1012780	that's part of Rock Band 1, which is a song export feature, that I think makes it stand
1012780	1018780	out from Guitar Hero easy because now, if it were like DDR, you can take all your songs
1018780	1024400	from the previous mixes and add them in to your next, you know, Rock Band 2, you know,
1024400	1028720	you take all those songs from Rock Band 1, Rock Band 3 is going to have 2 and 1, so you're
1028720	1032760	just going to get this ever-expanding song list and I think that's pretty cool.
1032760	1034360	Yeah, no, I definitely agree.
1034360	1035360	I think that's cool.
1035360	1039100	I think that's one of the greatest things is just firing up a make-your-own set list
1039100	1043720	type thing and you have like literally 150 songs to choose from because you have download
1043720	1048680	songs, Rock Band 1 songs, Rock Band 2 songs, it's insane, but awesome.
1048680	1051680	And then like, you know, playing a random set list or playing online when you have to
1051680	1055600	play random songs, you get songs you forgot you had or songs you didn't know you even
1055600	1058560	had to play, so that's kind of cool.
1058560	1061720	Other games I've been playing this week, Spore, Spore, Spore, I bought Spore and I've been
1061720	1067240	playing that, like Loki, I can't seem to get past the tribal phase, but it's because A,
1067240	1071380	I have a quick attention span and B, I just kind of suck at it and the game doesn't give
1071380	1076080	you a whole lot of help, so you kind of have to learn about the game yourself.
1076080	1079760	And I find that when I get too frustrated, I want to go back and start from the beginning
1079760	1082560	and try a bunch of things different I didn't do right the first time.
1082560	1085520	That's kind of what I've been doing is like, you know, the first time I was trying to do
1085520	1089040	an herbivore, make nice with everybody, but then I was like, you know what, fuck this,
1089040	1091520	I want to be a carnivore and just eat everybody.
1091520	1094120	So that's how I decided to play the second time around.
1094120	1097720	The other thing I learned about Spore is that I really suck at making animals.
1097720	1101040	I mean, don't get me wrong, the interface is really awesome.
1101040	1102680	I love the creature creator.
1102680	1107000	It really does make you feel like, you know, even if you don't know much about art or whatever,
1107000	1111260	you can do some neat things just by basically clicking and moving the mouse in random directions.
1111260	1115600	You can get these Picasso style animals that aren't that bad, but I still feel like I'm
1115600	1120000	crap crappy at animal design, but that's just something I guess is learned with time because
1120000	1125940	I kind of like, Loki, you had a creature that has like one ginormous eye, like a scorpion
1125940	1129280	that showed up in my planet that was actually kind of cool looking.
1129280	1135600	Oh yeah, it was supposed to be like a dog looking thing and the eye was its nose because
1135600	1136600	it was black.
1136600	1141080	It kind of looked, I called it spike and it had like a, my, my current creature, that's
1141080	1144120	like a, a carnivore that just eats everything.
1144120	1150840	It looks like a velociraptor, but with a giant, um, mouth, but it's like one of those, like,
1150840	1152120	hello, my name is George.
1152120	1158760	Like type of mouths, like, like, like, uh, you know, old, you know, pudgy guy mouth.
1158760	1161600	I'm sorry, but like all the creatures in that game looks stupid.
1161600	1164440	It's like even, even the ones I create, I'm like, wow, that looks dumb.
1164440	1165840	Look at the stuff on Sporepedia though.
1165840	1167640	There's some pretty impressive stuff in there.
1167640	1173640	I mean, especially like what I do, I don't play with the internet random drops of animals
1173640	1175560	because I'm sure there's a lot of crap in there.
1175560	1180240	I only play with the Maxis ones, which you can't turn off and then my friends list.
1180240	1185880	So either I see crappy things my friends made or I can see the cool looking Maxis ones.
1185880	1188480	I should probably do that because there's been some really stupid things that came in.
1188480	1190840	How many penis monsters have you seen in Spore?
1190840	1191840	Zero.
1191840	1192840	Really?
1192840	1193840	Zero penis monsters.
1193840	1194840	I haven't made one though myself.
1194840	1195840	That's pretty impressive.
1195840	1196840	I'm surprised.
1196840	1198760	I get, well, can't you like report it or something if it happens?
1198760	1199760	I don't know.
1199760	1200760	See, that's the thing.
1200760	1204200	I don't have to report it because I just want to, I was going to make a planet of penis
1204200	1207080	monsters or something because that'd be funny.
1207080	1210080	The one other thing I've been playing, I've been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the
1210080	1211080	Lich King.
1211080	1212080	I got into beta.
1212080	1215880	I didn't really read the user and agreement, so I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say
1215880	1216880	about it.
1216880	1218360	Although I'm pretty sure most wild side has been talking pretty openly about it.
1218360	1220760	I'm going to talk about everything about it.
1220760	1223220	I honestly, what is there to talk about?
1223220	1226720	It's been extremely laggy and very hard to kill things.
1226720	1229040	I was like, Ooh, pretty new splash screens.
1229040	1230040	Ooh, pretty new graphics.
1230040	1231960	I'm on a pretty new continent.
1231960	1236120	But that's about as much as I could see because it was very, very laggy, but it's a beta.
1236120	1237280	It's free for me to play.
1237280	1239680	I can't complain nor base a review off it.
1239680	1240680	So what can you do?
1240680	1241680	I can complain.
1241680	1246060	Oh, I'd rather not complain because I realize it's a beta and it's free and it's not the
1246060	1247800	finished product.
1247800	1250160	But all I can say is that it's hard for me to get a feel for it.
1250160	1251160	I will say this though.
1251160	1253800	The new achievement system is kind of interesting.
1253800	1257480	I noticed that now you have to have a Blizzard account and I think that's how it's going
1257480	1263720	to tie to Diablo and Starcraft 2 and the other Blizzard franchises.
1263720	1268920	And the game does pretty much know with some hit and miss accuracy what achievements you've
1268920	1270160	already unlocked.
1270160	1273800	I think it goes through your quest log and figures out what quests you've already done
1273800	1276120	and therefore what achievements you must have beat.
1276120	1282200	But when I first fired up my character on the beta and unlocked all the achievements
1282200	1288240	you get from historical information, the game does not think I've ever run Slave Pens Heroic.
1288240	1292840	And if you're a Warcraft player, you know that everybody has run Slave Pens Heroic a
1292840	1294800	lot once you're at level 70.
1294800	1296360	It's like free badges.
1296360	1301260	So it still has some tweaking to do, but it's not bad.
1301260	1302260	So anyway, that's it.
1302260	1303520	I don't want to drag out gaming week too long.
1303520	1304940	We're already like 20 minutes into the show.
1304940	1306560	We got gaming news to get to.
1306560	1308880	I'll really quickly save for housekeeping tonight.
1308880	1310240	There's not an awful lot to say.
1310240	1311240	Just a reminder.
1311240	1313280	I'll be at E for All in a couple weeks.
1313280	1315400	Sadly, Dark Soccer and Loki will not be joining me.
1315400	1318160	But I'll be there hoping to meet some of you in the LA area that are going to come out
1318160	1319160	for E for All.
1319160	1320160	Look at All Games booth.
1320160	1321860	It's supposed to be right out there on the main floor.
1321860	1323360	It's going to be pretty awesome.
1323360	1325840	I'm sure they'll say more about that on allgames.com.
1325840	1330360	And that is the first weekend in October, the third through the fifth, if I'm not mistaken.
1330360	1332760	I will be there in LA.
1332760	1338220	Also, if you haven't already, check us out on Twitter at username OLR on Twitter.
1338220	1339220	That's a new one.
1339220	1342960	There's always our live journal at Orange Lounge, our Myspace at Orange Lounge Radio.
1342960	1343960	And Facebook.
1343960	1344960	Our name is the OLR me.
1344960	1345960	That's right.
1345960	1348160	Four different sites, four different names, just to confuse you further.
1348160	1349160	All right.
1349160	1351720	Let's get into the gaming news for tonight.
1351720	1352720	We'll start off with Loki.
1352720	1354560	What's going on in gaming news?
1354560	1358880	Well, Nintendo has released a new peripheral for the Wii system.
1358880	1361400	No, it's not a hard drive.
1361400	1365860	It's a wireless router because I guess they phased out the little USB sticks that they
1365860	1368640	had to use with your PC.
1368640	1375880	And now this is its own standalone thing and will allow you to connect to, it's basically
1375880	1384520	I guess like an ethernet bridge, and will allow you to connect your Wii to your router,
1384520	1386960	to your wired network.
1386960	1387960	I don't know.
1387960	1388960	Do we really need this?
1388960	1392160	Is this a replacement for the dongle they had, the USB stick that you had?
1392160	1394560	Rob, you just said one of my favorite funny words.
1394560	1395560	Dongle?
1395560	1396560	Dongle.
1396560	1398720	I'm going to make a spore creature and call it dongle.
1398720	1399720	Dongle?
1399720	1400720	Let me put it this way.
1400720	1401720	Okay.
1401720	1402720	I'll make one called balls.
1402720	1403720	All right.
1403720	1404720	You do that.
1404720	1409920	It's an okay idea I guess to have a wireless router or a wireless bridge for whatever reason
1409920	1415280	because say you want to connect your Wii to your wireless network.
1415280	1421460	Well, the problem is for 53 bucks, it costs actually 5800 yen or $53 US, which is about
1421460	1422800	the equivalent there.
1422800	1429720	For 57 bucks, you could probably get yourself a wireless router and then all of your systems
1429720	1430720	can use it.
1430720	1434480	Oh, and it also works with DS as well.
1434480	1435480	I don't know.
1435480	1440680	Well, my thought is what exactly are you going to take your Wii online for that badly if
1440680	1442160	you need one of these?
1442160	1444160	To buy more virtual console games I guess?
1444160	1445160	Yeah.
1445160	1449440	I mean are there that many games that support, I guess Brawl and all that, but not a lot.
1449440	1454080	This is just so your Wii can connect to the internet.
1454080	1461120	This is basically a wireless router, but it's Nintendo branded and it looks like the Wii
1461120	1462480	sort of.
1462480	1463480	I don't know.
1463480	1468600	I think it's a waste of time, but there's cheaper solutions out there.
1468600	1473480	Say for example this is sitting next to your wired router, your Wii is, I mean they have
1473480	1479560	$20 USB wired dongles that you can get to connect straight to it.
1479560	1480560	Yeah, dongle.
1480560	1484040	I mean it beats paying $53.
1484040	1485040	I don't know.
1485040	1489800	I don't really think this is a problem for a lot of people to connect wirelessly to their
1489800	1490800	network or something.
1490800	1493000	Just buy a new router.
1493000	1495840	AlphaKananagram in chat says this does allow PCs.
1495840	1498760	It's a router for PCs as well.
1498760	1504800	Well that's awesome, but once again I would rather that you bought just a normal router.
1504800	1505800	Buy a Linksys or something.
1505800	1507000	But is it pretty?
1507000	1508000	That's the important question.
1508000	1511760	Linksys are not that pretty white with the blue lights.
1511760	1516440	It's white and they have a little stand that makes it stand up just like the Wii, but it,
1516440	1519460	I mean, I don't know.
1519460	1523240	I guess this is gonna appeal to the same people that like, you know, Macs, you know, pretty
1523240	1524960	but useless.
1524960	1528840	Hey Jamie, dongle.
1528840	1530760	Who knows?
1530760	1533600	This may never come out over here.
1533600	1537720	Oh, by the way though, if you are interested in this and you want to get it and you live
1537720	1541400	in Japan, it will be coming out on the 18th.
1541400	1549160	Alright, moving on to more hardware possibly, but not a hard drive according to Reggie Fils-Aime
1549160	1552360	who spoke to the Nintendo magazine Club Nintendo.
1552360	1555440	That's the Latin American magazine translated.
1555440	1559000	Reggie actually said, quote, we are working on a storage solution.
1559000	1561960	We have never said that it will be a hard drive, nor have we mentioned how we will fix
1561960	1562960	this issue.
1562960	1566160	We are going to deliver a better way to store the games.
1566160	1570080	You might remember I got really pissed off when this guy over at Nintendo Europe referred
1570080	1574520	to everybody that wanted this storage solution as Geeks and Otaku.
1574520	1577940	It was what they wanted and I thought that was a completely idiotic thing to have one
1577940	1581440	of your representatives saying that and I said, you know what, screw Nintendo, I'm not
1581440	1585760	going to buy anything online until they fix this problem and yes, I know I could copy
1585760	1589480	things to the SD card and copy them back, but I don't want to.
1589480	1594520	I shouldn't have to go through that because A, it's slow and B, why can't it just read
1594520	1595520	off the SD card?
1595520	1596840	It could use some type of cache or something.
1596840	1597840	I don't know.
1597840	1598840	It can't be that difficult.
1598840	1599840	This worries me.
1599840	1600840	I'm sorry.
1600840	1601840	Why?
1601840	1605840	This statement worries me because they're trying to think up a solution that's a creative
1605840	1608180	solution to this.
1608180	1612040	Why go the elaborate route when you can just go the easy route and make it so that it will
1612040	1615640	work with USB hard drives or USB flash drives or something like that?
1615640	1619720	They're going to try to do something stupid like network storage where they'll just basically
1619720	1623680	store the game on their server and you'll have a key and you'll have to download it
1623680	1625640	every time you want to play it or something like that.
1625640	1627200	They're going to do something retarded like this.
1627200	1628200	I know it.
1628200	1634760	Well, here's my thought is that Wii 2, just like they've done a DS and a DS Lite, they'll
1634760	1635760	release a Wii 2.
1635760	1637400	They should give us a dongle.
1637400	1640400	The increased storage and possibly a dongle attachment.
1640400	1648440	It needs to have a dongle attachment that leads to Bluetooth to a separate hard drive.
1648440	1649440	Don't get me wrong.
1649440	1654760	I mean, they had some innovative ideas when they first put out the Wii, but all ideas
1654760	1659840	since that haven't been that innovative and actually have been kind of a step backwards.
1659840	1660840	Let's see.
1660840	1663480	We had, well, what are we going to do for shooter games?
1663480	1664480	I know.
1664480	1665840	Let's release a plastic shell.
1665840	1667100	What are we going to do for driving games?
1667100	1668100	I know.
1668100	1669100	Let's release a plastic shell.
1669100	1671000	What are we going to do for storage?
1671000	1672000	I know.
1672000	1673000	Let's do something stupid.
1673000	1675000	I mean, that's what's going to happen.
1675000	1679200	I can just see Reggie at next E3 coming out to introduce Wii Plus or Wii 2.
1679200	1680200	Look at this.
1680200	1682200	It's holographic storage.
1682200	1685720	With his increased storage space and his massive dongle.
1685720	1686720	Look at this.
1686720	1688520	It will come with it.
1688520	1689640	I can see it now.
1689640	1690640	It's Rob the Robot.
1690640	1694440	He stores your data by stacking blocks or something really retarded.
1694440	1695800	He shoves it all in his dongle.
1695800	1696800	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1696800	1697800	Think about that.
1697800	1702440	Wouldn't that be cool if they made, like, a little USB storage device like Rob the Robot?
1702440	1703440	No, it won't happen.
1703440	1709120	I always thought they should release a miniature Rob the Robot that plugs into your DS and
1709120	1710120	game right now.
1710120	1712400	That plugs into his ass slot.
1712400	1713400	I'm sorry.
1713400	1715440	It's like those bikes on South Park.
1715440	1716560	I don't know if you ever...
1716560	1717560	Forget it.
1717560	1721920	All they're saying is, I mean, don't say that you have a better idea of how to store data
1721920	1723800	because so far it has not worked.
1723800	1729120	I mean, your stupid archaic system of blocks is retarded, all right?
1729120	1733320	Use actual data that everybody uses, you know, kilobytes.
1733320	1735880	That's something that people are familiar nowadays.
1735880	1739880	People aren't, like, going, oh, it's a mystical device that connects through the Internet
1739880	1741000	via magic.
1741000	1743260	I mean, people aren't that dumb.
1743260	1748920	They do have a rudimentary understanding of how computers work, all right?
1748920	1754960	And to be honest, if they don't understand storage and stuff and what kilobytes mean,
1754960	1755960	guess what?
1755960	1760080	Maybe they'll learn to, you know, figure out what this is via their Wii.
1760080	1761680	I mean, that's a great idea.
1761680	1766480	Instead, no, we're going to make it, we're just going to pander to the idiots and figure
1766480	1767480	out a way to do that.
1767480	1769680	Thank you, GS68, Wild Wacky Action Bike.
1769680	1773800	I'm waiting for that attachment to come out on Wii, just so you know.
1773800	1777880	I'm telling you, man, whatever it's going to be, I'm just ready for a disappointment.
1777880	1780640	We need Wild Wacky Action Bike Wii.
1780640	1786280	It would sell like crazy, and you know it.
1786280	1790800	It's seriously, whatever they're going to announce at E3 is just going to be a disappointment.
1790800	1791800	All right.
1791800	1794800	But we are getting a dongle, right?
1794800	1795800	We might.
1795800	1797920	They're going to, seriously, they're going to be like, we've been working on this for
1797920	1801200	years, and it's a Nintendo-branded SD card.
1801200	1802200	Fuck yourselves.
1802200	1803200	Bye.
1803200	1806360	Well, we'll see what happens.
1806360	1810480	I don't plan on any of my stupid little boycott just yet, because most stuff I want that's
1810480	1813960	been coming out on Wii lately, namely the Strong Bad Games, have also been coming out
1813960	1814960	on PC.
1814960	1815960	Problem fixed.
1815960	1820440	Well, I'm still going to be downloading Choaniki behind my husband's back.
1820440	1824160	Ooh, I like Charan's comment, a Wild Wacky Action Dongle.
1824160	1825160	Ooh!
1825160	1827120	That could be like an OLR dream game.
1827120	1830640	And by the way, I was gifted Choaniki this week.
1830640	1831640	So much to gift me.
1831640	1832640	Thank you.
1832640	1833640	Heart.
1833640	1834640	Gift me next.
1834640	1835640	Gifts?
1835640	1838920	I can't break my boycott when people give me gifts.
1838920	1841040	I forgot to remind you to take the Wii Fit.
1841040	1845120	Oh, that's alright, I'll get it next week, or something.
1845120	1846120	More news!
1846120	1847120	More news!
1847120	1848120	Dun dun dun!
1848120	1851840	Mega Man 9, for everyone who has been happy and excited and getting a little bit flickery
1851840	1857640	giddy about it, it actually has a Japanese release date now.
1857640	1862920	Mega Man 9 is supposed to be out in Japan on September 24th for a thousand Wii points.
1862920	1869160	We don't have our date here yet, or in Europe, but Capcom loves us.
1869160	1873240	At least they better, bitches.
1873240	1874560	I'm sure it'll be here soon.
1874560	1876800	No, but seriously, seriously, seriously.
1876800	1883640	It was actually reported, I do believe, by Dengeki Online, the release date, so not too
1883640	1884640	bad.
1884640	1886160	So I'm looking forward to it.
1886160	1889520	I would honestly think that we'd probably get it close to the same day.
1889520	1892920	I was gonna say, is odds looking good we'll get it around the same day?
1892920	1894360	I hope so.
1894360	1895360	Be nice.
1895360	1896360	Maybe.
1896360	1901240	Well, if you can't wait that long, you'll be happy to know that Strong Bad, episode
1901240	1910080	2, Strong Baddie of the Free, will be releasing this Monday on WiiWare and on the PC.
1910080	1911080	Woohoo!
1911080	1915320	And I have no idea what's gonna be happening in the game, because 1, I didn't play the
1915320	1920640	first one, and 2, I don't really visit the websites.
1920640	1923120	More of the wonderful humor that was in the first game.
1923120	1924120	Of course.
1924120	1925120	It's episode 2.
1925120	1926120	It's awesome.
1926120	1927560	It's like you watch a TV series, this is episode 2.
1927560	1930880	Like you watch a show like South Park and episode 1 was funny, so you tune into episode
1930880	1931880	2.
1931880	1932880	That's the whole thing.
1932880	1935080	And then things get angsty in episode 2.
1935080	1936240	Yes.
1936240	1940040	And you know, characters start sleeping with each other and form these complex relationships.
1940040	1942880	No, I totally made that up.
1942880	1944720	But that would be interesting.
1944720	1946920	I think you've been watching too much daytime TV, right?
1946920	1948920	No, just 90210.
1948920	1950920	Alright.
1950920	1952560	Just kidding.
1952560	1955040	Moving on, something else is coming out on the Wii quite soon.
1955040	1960840	Wii Music, and you know, we've had certainly mixed opinions on Wii Music, but sometimes
1960840	1965680	I kind of think that Nintendo does these kinds of things just to kind of impress us.
1965680	1967600	Like try to get a certain niche audience.
1967600	1974880	That's right, you are hearing in the background cowbell in Wii Music.
1974880	1978120	Wii Music is actually getting cowbell.
1978120	1979720	And they're actually demoing it there.
1979720	1981920	You can actually check out a little trailer there.
1981920	1985500	It's hit game trailers, but it's also on Nintendo's site.
1985500	1991260	So insert your needs more cowbell joke here, because it's probably what got this in the
1991260	1992260	game.
1992260	1995580	Somebody at Nintendo thought, heh, joke, funny.
1995580	1999760	Or that the cowbell is actually considered a real instrument, which in some ways it really
1999760	2000760	is.
2000760	2004000	The cowbell isn't, I actually got through this music store at Hayton Ashbury, that has
2004000	2005480	like cowbells with features.
2005480	2008840	I'm like dude, it's like cowbell.
2008840	2009840	Electronic cowbell.
2009840	2014040	Oh, this one's got extra muting, and this one has tone change, and this one's got this.
2014040	2016160	I'm like dude, it's cowbell.
2016160	2017160	You bang it with a stick.
2017160	2018760	I played the electric cowbell.
2018760	2022320	I know, electric cowbell, that'd be awesome.
2022320	2023320	Amplified cowbell.
2023320	2024320	Amplified cowbell.
2024320	2028160	Like a cowbell that sounds like a gong every time you hit it.
2028160	2030360	A cowbell doesn't vibrate like that.
2030360	2032560	Do you get to play gong in Wii music?
2032560	2033760	That would be kind of awesome.
2033760	2037200	No, but I will gong Wii music.
2037200	2038680	Alright.
2038680	2041720	Wii music is getting more cowbell.
2041720	2042720	Haters!
2042720	2043720	There you go.
2043720	2046160	Well, this is something that I love.
2046160	2047800	Very happy about this.
2047800	2055240	There have been ratings put out for the Australian OFLC board for Castlevania III Dracula's Curse.
2055240	2059120	That'll be for a virtual console, and they gave it a G rating.
2059120	2062800	So that's fairly indicative that we're going to be getting it to be joining all the others
2062800	2064120	that are already there.
2064120	2065640	Isn't that nice?
2065640	2068400	It's wonderful news, because Castlevania III is one of the best.
2068400	2069400	Really.
2069400	2070400	One thing I hope.
2070400	2071400	Really.
2071400	2072400	Hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.
2072400	2073720	That it's like the Japanese version.
2073720	2076920	I somehow knew you were going to go there and get into the whole discussion about the
2076920	2078200	extra sound or whatever.
2078200	2079200	No, that wasn't it.
2079200	2080200	I thought that was what it was.
2080200	2084160	When you played Grant, you know, the one who walks, who climbs on the ceiling and everything?
2084160	2085160	Hell yeah!
2085160	2086560	How can you forget Grant if you've ever played Castlevania III?
2086560	2090880	Well, he throws his knife instead of just stabs, so he actually has a ranged attack.
2090880	2092160	Oh, so he's actually useful.
2092160	2093160	Yes.
2093160	2094160	Oh, nice.
2094160	2095800	Because I always used the one that had the fire ice.
2095800	2096800	Cypher?
2096800	2097800	Yeah.
2097800	2102120	But what's the point in him throwing knives if he can have a sub-weapon of throwing knives?
2102120	2103840	I don't think he can.
2103840	2108080	Wasn't there something else, too, with Castlevania, and it's that the Famicom since it had like
2108080	2109080	an extra sound?
2109080	2110480	Didn't it have an extra sound processor or something?
2110480	2111480	I think it did.
2111480	2119440	I think if I'm correct, it ran off the disc, and the disc system did actually have, like
2119440	2123360	have you ever heard the Legend of Zelda for the Famicom disc?
2123360	2125200	Had actually really nice music in it.
2125200	2126200	Oh, okay.
2126200	2127800	So it was the difference in the sound processors, too.
2127800	2134000	Little known fact, the Famicom disc system had a sound channel for porno soundtracks.
2134000	2135000	What?
2135000	2136000	True.
2136000	2137000	False.
2137000	2138000	Absolutely true.
2138000	2139000	What?
2139000	2140000	Really?
2140000	2141000	I wouldn't lie.
2141000	2142000	Absolutely true.
2142000	2143000	Yes, you would.
2143000	2145640	Game Guru in chat says, JP will get JP version, US will get US version.
2145640	2151720	Sad but true, but well, or if it's easier to not emulate off the disc system, because
2151720	2156840	I don't think there have been any disc games that have come to Virtual Console, maybe JP
2156840	2157840	will get US version.
2157840	2159560	No, it's going to be the US version.
2159560	2161560	We got Excitebike, didn't we?
2161560	2163280	Oh, that's true, we did.
2163280	2167120	No, but Excitebike wasn't the disc version.
2167120	2168480	What did they do with the save load?
2168480	2171360	Even here in America, though, remember, we got the cartridge and it still had save load,
2171360	2174600	and it would just crash your game if you tried to use it, which I thought was one of the
2174600	2178640	most hilarious things ever on the old school Nintendo, that they just left it in there
2178640	2179640	when we didn't have the attachment.
2179640	2180640	Awesome.
2180640	2184160	Well, if I was right, the entire game was done in English anyway.
2184160	2185160	Hmm.
2185160	2191280	If only Nintendo knew they were setting trends with Excitebike that soon will be followed
2191280	2195520	by large companies like EA releasing games that are broken.
2195520	2196520	Awesome.
2196520	2201840	I think Gyromite also had it, if I'm right, but no, it didn't, because Gyromite was the
2201840	2207160	one that my husband and I went through like 15 copies of when he had his used game store,
2207160	2210680	and took out the converter cartridge so that we could make our own converter.
2210680	2211680	Oh, nice.
2211680	2212680	Nice.
2212680	2213680	Yeah.
2213680	2218760	There were actually that many copies of Gyromite in circulation, that many Rob the Robot sold.
2218760	2219760	My friend had one.
2219760	2220760	We have one.
2220760	2221760	I knew one friend that had one.
2221760	2222760	We have one.
2222760	2223760	What did they really do?
2223760	2224760	Like nothing.
2224760	2225760	They had the little spinny thing.
2225760	2226760	It was a selling point, that's it.
2226760	2227760	It didn't do anything.
2227760	2231720	You can play three games with this thing, and he's going to look cool, and then that's
2231720	2232720	it.
2232720	2233720	He looks like Johnny Five.
2233720	2237080	I mean, a lot of people don't really understand what Rob the Robot actually did.
2237080	2241060	Like basically, didn't he just, like he had these little spinning disks that you would
2241060	2245720	put down, like these little top things that you would put down on these giant things that
2245720	2247600	just pressed your controller?
2247600	2248600	Pretty much.
2248600	2249600	It was-
2249600	2250600	It was-
2250600	2251600	Rob, it was a selling point.
2251600	2255560	It was amazingly stupid in retrospect, and I realized that Rob the Robot is like pop
2255560	2259840	culture cool, and everybody like laughed when they saw him in Brawl, but if you think about
2259840	2266160	it, Rob the Robot was really stupid, like in all actuality.
2266160	2269600	But anyhow, sorry, let's move on to some release dates.
2269600	2271880	Rob, like I said, it was a selling point.
2271880	2274720	Yeah, because people look at the box, and you think-
2274720	2276920	Nintendo does what Genesis don't.
2276920	2281280	You think that Rob the Robot is going to vacuum your house, but that's not what it does.
2281280	2282280	It does nothing.
2282280	2285640	Yeah, you're going to have to dust off Rob the Robot once in a while.
2285640	2286840	All right, look, enough bitterness.
2286840	2289200	Let's get to some release dates around the world, Loki.
2289200	2291660	Rob the Robot just exudes awesome.
2291660	2294120	That's what Rob the Robot does.
2294120	2295120	He exudes fail.
2295120	2296120	That's what Rob the Robot does.
2296120	2297120	Exudes awesome.
2297120	2302120	Okay, so today, we had Rock Band 2 come out on the 360.
2302120	2307320	For everybody else that's on other platforms, you wait till October.
2307320	2316280	Anyways, on PC this week, we've got Stalker Clear Sky, Cabela's Big Game Hunter 09 Legendary
2316280	2323080	Adventures, and that's also coming out on the PlayStation 2 Wii, and I believe that's
2323080	2324720	it.
2324720	2328960	Let's see here, Star Wars The Force Unleashed will be coming out on pretty much every system
2328960	2331440	out there.
2331440	2337760	Not any retro systems, all current systems, until someone makes a joke.
2337760	2342480	Drawn to Life, Spongebob Squarepants Edition.
2342480	2343480	This is funny.
2343480	2345800	They have on this list, Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed.
2345800	2348400	Oh, that game's been canceled.
2348400	2353200	TNA Impact coming out on the Wii this week, delayed from last week.
2353200	2358680	Crisis Warhead on PC, I like how they had that PC built for it, even though this game
2358680	2364720	is more, I don't know, it's meant for lower end PCs.
2364720	2368240	The Witcher Enhanced Edition on PC.
2368240	2372560	We have Hell's Kitchen coming out on PC this week.
2372560	2376980	Armored Core for Answer on PS3 and Xbox 360.
2376980	2380960	We have Igor coming out on PC, DS, and the Wii.
2380960	2385200	Line Rider 2 Unbound on PC and DS.
2385200	2389800	Dance Dance Revolution X on PlayStation 2.
2389800	2393520	Enchanted Unicorn on PC.
2393520	2399600	Kid Supports Crazy Golf on the Wii, that game's gonna suck, it's Data Design Interactive.
2399600	2402680	Bratz Ponies 2 on DS.
2402680	2407160	Dragon Quest IV, Chapters of the Chosen on DS.
2407160	2410160	Battle of Fantasia on 360.
2410160	2416960	My Secret World by Imagine, the same people did that Imagine Baby stuff, and it's a diary.
2416960	2418800	Yay, a diary!
2418800	2428080	Up here on PS3, 360, and PC, we got Super Pickups on the Wii, Unsolved Crimes on the
2428080	2434880	DS, Zoo Hospital on the Wii, apparently it's like Trauma Center meets, like, a pet hospital,
2434880	2436320	it's kinda neat.
2436320	2440960	Red Bull BC-1, that game I've been kinda talking about for a while now, check it out, it's
2440960	2442960	on the DS.
2442960	2448880	And let's see, there's some collections, retro collections coming out from Namco, they have
2448880	2459480	the Naruto Ultimate Collection, which is Naruto the Ultimate Ninja 2 and 3, and Uzumaki Chronicles.
2459480	2466440	And then the Namco Classic Fighter Collection, which is Soul Calibur II Tekken 5, and, god,
2466440	2468040	I can't remember the last one.
2468040	2471440	And then Pac-Man Power Pack, which is a bunch of Pac-Man games.
2471440	2473440	Nothing good, unfortunately.
2473440	2477440	And I think that's all the big stuff, at least.
2477440	2483680	Alright, yeah, any price point, I know a lot of our listeners are probably into DDRX, any
2483680	2485120	price point for that?
2485120	2489560	I wanna say it's $40 for the game only, and for the bundle it's probably $49.99.
2489560	2494440	I would've thought maybe it came down a little bit in price, because PS2 is kinda, you know,
2494440	2495440	the last...
2495440	2499200	It may have, I'm just going off memory, and that's, you know, not exactly accurate.
2499200	2500920	Alright, so don't take that as the final word.
2500920	2503040	Here, give me one second, I can tell you.
2503040	2505840	Well, let me do the Japanese release dates, then you can kinda jump in whenever you find
2505840	2506840	it.
2506840	2510320	Going over to the Japanese release dates, Star Wars The Force Unleashed is coming into
2510320	2515480	the Asian regions around Japan, and on all those other consoles as well.
2515480	2519640	As far as Japan, Japan itself is getting Unreal Tournament 3 on the Xbox 360 this week, on
2519640	2523560	the 18th, for those folks that like the first-person shooters over there.
2523560	2528080	I know the scene's not quite as big over there, but they've got some fans of it.
2528080	2531880	Some PlayStation 3 games getting a price reduction this week, including Def Jam Icon and Fight
2531880	2532880	Knight Round 3.
2532880	2539560	Again, those are price reductions on the PlayStation 3, down to about $30 US.
2539560	2544920	Some other games coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 3, GI Jockey 4 2008, and Winning
2544920	2550040	Post 7 in a combo pack, or, of course, you can just get the game GI Jockey 4 by itself.
2550040	2555640	Also, Trusty Bell, Shoupan no Yume, you might know this here as Eternal Sonata, finally
2555640	2558360	comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
2558360	2560760	It's $29.99 for the game only.
2560760	2561760	Much better.
2561760	2562760	Good.
2562760	2566280	Unreal Tournament 3 also comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week, so be on the lookout
2566280	2567820	for that.
2567820	2573760	Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo Wii, we have Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles getting
2573760	2574760	a price reduction.
2574760	2577560	You know that, of course, as Resident Evil.
2577560	2580200	GI Jockey Wii 2008 as well.
2580200	2582000	Kororimpa gets a price reduction.
2582000	2585280	Bomberman comes out next week, so be on the lookout for that.
2585280	2589120	That's actually on next week's list, on the 25th.
2589120	2594760	Moving on to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 2 still getting a lot of love.
2594760	2599920	Hyper Street Fighter 2, the Anniversary Edition and Vampire Darkstalkers Collection value
2599920	2600920	pack.
2600920	2607400	So, for you old-school 2D Capcom fighting fans, a little PS2 pack coming out for you
2607400	2608400	guys.
2608400	2609400	That's happiness.
2609400	2616640	GI Jockey 4 2008 also gets a version on PlayStation 2 and gets a combo pack with Winning Post
2616640	2618200	7, also on PlayStation 2.
2618200	2623960	And a game called Heart no Kuni no Alice is coming out as well on the PlayStation 2.
2623960	2629720	Let's take a look at the handheld systems, starting off on the Nintendo DS.
2629720	2634200	Dragon Ball DS comes out this week from Namco Bandai.
2634200	2637240	Lumi's Sleight, Hikari no Puzzle as well.
2637240	2640960	Long Vacation, Iruka Toel Watashi comes out.
2640960	2649880	And Oshishi Keiji, Keiji-san Watashi Ga Arimashita comes out from success.
2649880	2653480	And we'll see if it will be a success over in Japan, although probably not.
2653480	2654480	I've never heard of it.
2654480	2660920	On the Sony PlayStation Portable, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G Hunter Leather Cover.
2660920	2661960	So that's not a game.
2661960	2666480	It's just something to match all the Monster Hunter games that you have for your PlayStation
2666480	2667480	Portable.
2667480	2672280	But if you actually want a new game, you can get Samurai Dou Portable is the name of that
2672280	2673280	game.
2673280	2676800	And I'm not sure if that's a fighting game or what type of game that is.
2676800	2679360	It looks to be an action-based game.
2679360	2680520	I don't think it's a fighting game, though.
2680520	2683720	I think it's a hack-and-slash type PSP game.
2683720	2688600	It's rated 15-plus or 0C, so you know there's going to be some good blood.
2688600	2689600	Hooray!
2689600	2690600	Blood!
2690600	2691600	Gore!
2691600	2692600	That's it for your Japanese release dates.
2692600	2699160	For the UK, we have the 18th Warhammer Online, for the 19th is everything else.
2699160	2706280	Destroy All Humans Path of Furon, Hell's Kitchen the video game, Play TV for PlayStation 3,
2706280	2715360	Open City Creator, Star Wars The Force Unleashed, also STCC The Game, The Witcher Enhanced Edition,
2715360	2717600	and Tim Stockdale's Writing Star.
2717600	2723040	Oh, and also Yakuza 2.
2723040	2724040	That's it?
2724040	2725040	That's it.
2725040	2727560	You know, The Force Unleashed, we all mentioned that in our respective releases.
2727560	2730600	It's practically a worldwide release this week.
2730600	2733720	But one thing that's kind of interesting about it, one thing I was reading about on the internet,
2733720	2737680	I was trying to see if GameStop was doing a Rock Band 2 midnight release, because I
2737680	2740040	really just didn't want to go to Walmart, but it was pretty much the only thing that
2740040	2743880	was open, and yes, I had to have the game at 1201, even though I didn't get it until
2743880	2744880	1230.
2744880	2748800	But anyway, apparently the reason why GameStop did not do a midnight release for Rock Band
2748800	2753160	2 is because a lot of them are doing midnight releases for Force Unleashed, and they just
2753160	2754600	didn't want to pay all that extra salary.
2754600	2758680	A lot of people, I mean, I would see why they're doing that, because The Force Unleashed is
2758680	2762840	coming out on a lot more systems, and a lot of people might not be interested in the game-only
2762840	2764640	version of Rock Band.
2764640	2767120	And there's a lot of rabid Star Wars fans.
2767120	2768120	I mean, really.
2768120	2772280	So, I mean, I can understand why they would do that, but oh well.
2772280	2776840	VXJsonXV played Hell's Kitchen the game in our chat room, and he laughs hahaha and said,
2776840	2779560	I played Fox's Flash version of that.
2779560	2780560	It was silly.
2780560	2784240	Yeah, and you know what's funny is that Flash version of it is pretty much what you're getting
2784240	2785880	on the Wii and the DS.
2785880	2786880	Nice.
2786880	2788320	It's crap, so.
2788320	2790680	Frisbee says, bake that fucking bread now!
2790680	2794320	Sadly, I don't think the Wii version of the game will swear at you, which is the only
2794320	2796160	reason to watch Hell's Kitchen.
2796160	2797160	I don't get it.
2797160	2801600	Like, if you're not going to get berated by your Nintendo Wii, what's the point?
2801600	2805240	Now you're just playing, like, Cake Mania with some fire.
2805240	2811520	It's basically just, like, Cooking Mama mixed with American Idol, you know, where they berate
2811520	2813320	you based on your performance.
2813320	2814320	Sounds kind of fail-tastic.
2814320	2816320	It is fail-tastic.
2816320	2823740	So, anyways, at least some people have, I don't know, a good sense of humor about people
2823740	2826120	breaking street dates.
2826120	2832560	Rock Band 2, people that managed to get their copies early were welcomed with custom screens
2832560	2838600	taunting them from, I guess, Harmonic Central, including, welcome to Rock Band 2, nice work
2838600	2840800	on scoring this game before it comes out.
2840800	2845520	I remember there was another one on the day after that or so that was saying, you know,
2845520	2850120	try our impossible set list or something, see if you're worthy of owning the game early
2850120	2851120	and stuff like that.
2851120	2854200	So it was kind of funny.
2854200	2858920	And then, of course, for those people that finally picked up their copy, you'll be greeted
2858920	2867400	with some new tracks to download this Tuesday, including the Megadeth album Peace Sells,
2867400	2876600	Who's Buying, and they've got, it looks like, about seven songs available there for two
2876600	2881280	bucks each or you can buy the whole pack for eleven bucks, so you save a few bucks there.
2881280	2885560	Remember back in the day when like eight marathon songs was an album?
2885560	2888680	Like, you know, you'd get eight songs from a rock band, but they would be just like effing
2888680	2892520	epic rock songs, like seven, eight minutes in length?
2892520	2893520	Megadeth.
2893520	2894520	Awesome.
2894520	2895520	Megadeth was awesome.
2895520	2902280	And then also, if that's not your cup of tea, they have the Rock Band Tour Pack, which includes
2902280	2907260	One of Those Nights by The Cab, Hands Down by Dashboard Confessional, She's a Handsome
2907260	2911860	Woman by Panic at the Disco, and Natural Disaster by Plain White Teas.
2911860	2916800	All those are available for a buck or 80 Microsoft points, or you can buy the whole pack for
2916800	2917800	four dollars.
2917800	2920200	So you're saving zero money.
2920200	2921200	Nice.
2921200	2927320	By the way, speaking of rock band download stuff, I know our one and only Dark Sakura,
2927320	2932240	one thing she loves almost more than video games is Gorillaz, and therefore Blur, because
2932240	2934120	you know, the whole Damon Auburn connection.
2934120	2935320	I know!
2935320	2938720	I did check out Beetlebum, which is available in the Rock Band Store.
2938720	2940800	It is a cover, if you weren't already aware.
2940800	2941800	It's not horrible.
2941800	2942800	It's not worth having.
2942800	2943840	It's not horrible.
2943840	2946820	At least you have the song, because, you know, ideally you're supposed to get someone else
2946820	2950720	to sing to it anyway, but it is a cover, if you didn't know and already know.
2950720	2956160	Well, if you do sing it, you have to do the really, you know, extra thick accent that
2956160	2957800	he affects for the song.
2957800	2958800	Exactly.
2958800	2963640	You know, and I realize this is like the quintessential Blur song, but we have to have song two come
2963640	2964640	out at some point.
2964640	2965640	I mean, come on.
2965640	2970200	Either that, or There's No Other Way.
2970200	2971200	Or Boys and Girls.
2971200	2972200	I like that song.
2972200	2974200	Well, you know, my favorite is.
2974200	2975200	I like Coffee and TV too.
2975200	2976200	That's a good song.
2976200	2977200	Anyhow.
2977200	2981960	But, but they probably aren't going to have anything off of the later two Blur albums
2981960	2984200	because they're very kind of at least in this country.
2984200	2985200	Does anybody know this?
2985200	2986640	Did this weren't as big here?
2986640	2988520	Oasis was a weird album.
2988520	2989520	Yeah.
2989520	2990520	All right.
2990520	2991520	Anyhow.
2991520	2992520	Sorry.
2992520	2993520	Enough Blur dish.
2993520	2996520	By the way, I love the fact that the rock band people were so kind of, you know, funny
2996520	3000680	about the early release dates because true story, I have a friend of mine who is, uh,
3000680	3005520	who got the game early and was paranoid to go on Xbox live with the game, having it like
3005520	3010020	the Tuesday before, because he thought that they were going to like, you know, track him
3010020	3011920	and report him or something like that.
3011920	3015840	So I found this whole thing really funny because I sent a link to one of the blogs that had
3015840	3018800	a picture of the thing and I put, what are you so afraid of now?
3018800	3021180	You big chicken.
3021180	3025160	So I thought it was funny that, you know, everybody's afraid to go online, like they're
3025160	3027280	going to get busted and banned or something.
3027280	3028280	Yeah.
3028280	3031640	And harmonics really didn't seem to give us some of the, uh, we were playing that last
3031640	3037240	night and some of the, um, uh, like vocal sections in the game were kind of easy to
3037240	3038240	hit.
3038240	3039240	I remember, was it Jim?
3039240	3040240	Um, sabotage.
3040240	3041240	Right.
3041240	3046880	He would know what you want, what you want, he was just like kind of blah, blah, blah.
3046880	3047880	He's like drunk.
3047880	3053520	So, you know, he was just, that's what he was literally kind of yelling and he was like,
3053520	3054520	awesome.
3054520	3055520	I don't know.
3055520	3057000	I thought it was funny.
3057000	3060160	And then Irene, if you've listened to this show long enough, you know, rice princess
3060160	3065560	was making up new lyrics and saying something about my butt to all these songs, which was
3065560	3067440	very rude in my opinion.
3067440	3068440	Very rude.
3068440	3073400	Anyhow, thank God that there was no video camera there so it can be on YouTube.
3073400	3074400	All right.
3074400	3078420	Uh, let's talk about Guitar Hero for a minute cause you know, Guitar Hero is coming out
3078420	3081560	pretty soon and they're going to be having a, you know, their whole little kit.
3081560	3085320	They've got the, uh, drums and the guitar and I'm looking forward to this cause I need
3085320	3089040	a new guitar and I kind of really want the new Guitar Hero guitar.
3089040	3092900	Um, well, not only do you already know about the bundle, but now you know exactly what
3092900	3094960	songs you're going to be getting in the game.
3094960	3096760	I'm not going to read the entire song list.
3096760	3099280	You can probably just Google Guitar Hero World Tour song list.
3099280	3102600	You'll find the whole thing, but I do want to point out some highlights of the song list,
3102600	3103600	at least in my mind.
3103600	3104600	I'm sure everybody feels differently.
3104600	3110480	Uh, 311, Beautiful Disaster, Beastie Boys, No Sleep Till Brooklyn, Billy Idol, Rebel
3110480	3116280	Yell, Blink 182, Damn It, Blondie, One Way or Another, Bon Jovi, Living on a Prayer,
3116280	3121840	even though that's in rock band, Coldplay, Shiver, The Doors, Love Me Two Times, The
3121840	3127280	Eagles, Hotel California, Filter, Hey Man, Nice Shot, I like that song a lot, Fleetwood
3127280	3131200	Matt, Go Your Own Way, although again that's in rock band, Foo Fighters, Everlong, also
3131200	3136960	in rock band, Guess Who, American Woman, also I believe that is in rock band.
3136960	3138480	So there's quite a bit of overlap.
3138480	3142320	Um, Jimi Hendrix, Purple Haze, and The Wind Cries Mary, that's pretty cool they have Jimi
3142320	3143320	Hendrix.
3143320	3148360	Uh, the other kind of Jimi, Jimi Eat World with The Middle, Korn with Freak on a Leash,
3148360	3152440	Lenny Kravitz, Are You Gonna Go My Way, that is like the quintessential guitar song in
3152440	3153440	my opinion.
3153440	3155800	That's a fucking rad guitar song, I can't wait to play that.
3155800	3157960	Uh, Linkin Park, but who cares.
3157960	3161920	Leonard Skynyrd, Sweet Home Alabama, live.
3161920	3162920	Really sweet.
3162920	3165040	Yes, and I know you're an Alabama girl so you'll like that.
3165040	3170080	Metallica, Trapped Under Ice, Michael Jackson, Beat It, that's kind of awesome.
3170080	3171640	I wasn't expecting that one.
3171640	3177440	Uh, Muse with Assassin, Nirvana with the Unplugged version of About a Girl, that's pretty rad.
3177440	3183400	No Doubt with Spiderwebs, No FX, Sold Out, Ozzy Osbourne with Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley,
3183400	3189120	uh, Pat Benatar, Heartbreaker, R.E.M., the one I love, Smashing Pumpkins Today, although
3189120	3190120	that's in rock band.
3190120	3193520	Uh, I knew I said I wasn't going to read this whole thing but I kind of am.
3193520	3197320	Survivor, Eye of the Tiger, which is also in rock band but you know everybody loves
3197320	3198320	that song.
3198320	3201560	Sublime with Santeria, I don't really care for that song myself.
3201560	3202880	But a lot of people do.
3202880	3206560	Tool, three songs by Tool in the game.
3206560	3207560	I like Tool.
3207560	3213960	Uh, Para, Parabola, Schism and uh, Vicarious, Schism, I don't listen to Tool, I don't like
3213960	3214960	them actually.
3214960	3215960	But that's just...
3215960	3216960	Well, whatever.
3216960	3222800	Um, Van Halen, Hot for Teacher, that was a song that got played over and over again at
3222800	3225040	Penny Arcade Expo.
3225040	3228160	And Wings with Band on the Run.
3228160	3231120	Cause you know we needed some wings in Guitar Hero.
3231120	3235600	So there you go, Guitar Hero World Tour and uh, definitely, definitely a lot of very guitar
3235600	3236600	centric songs.
3236600	3239000	You know, especially with Jimi Hendrix, The Doors.
3239000	3240000	That's pretty awesome.
3240000	3244400	I'm surprised that they don't do like any, I wish they would have more songs like Beat
3244400	3245400	It and stuff like that.
3245400	3246400	Yeah, I know.
3246400	3247400	Like pop crossovers and stuff.
3247400	3249320	We need a pop band or a pop hero or something.
3249320	3251800	Not even necessarily have to do that but some download packs.
3251800	3255280	Like I don't understand why there isn't more Michael Jackson stuff in there cause Beat
3255280	3258020	It works and you might even be able to do like Thriller and stuff.
3258020	3261360	Just like stuff that had a lot of guitar and stuff in the background.
3261360	3264080	Dude, Thriller needs to be downloaded content.
3264080	3265600	Make it happen.
3265600	3266600	Lovely folks.
3266600	3267920	And like also like country stuff.
3267920	3271520	I mean there's that one song, Rockstar, that would work pretty well.
3271520	3274680	Um, I'm just surprised there's not a lot of that stuff.
3274680	3279380	It may not be enough for its own game but you know at least throw some download content
3279380	3280380	out there.
3280380	3284820	I'm sure people would appreciate, you know, appealing to a broad, or broader audience
3284820	3285820	I guess.
3285820	3291480	Alright, well there you have it, the Guitar Hero World Tour set list and a lot of guitar
3291480	3293640	fans very excited about this game.
3293640	3301120	Well, in other exciting news, and this is uh, actually I think it's pretty cool, um,
3301120	3304000	Rob, do you ever watch Comedy Central?
3304000	3305000	Of course!
3305000	3306000	I love Comedy Central.
3306000	3307000	That's where I get South Park.
3307000	3308000	What's your favorite show besides South Park?
3308000	3309000	South Park.
3309000	3310000	My favorite show besides South Park?
3310000	3311000	The Daily Show.
3311000	3312000	Okay, well I forgive you.
3312000	3315560	That actually is a good show but, um, for a...
3315560	3316880	My third favorite show?
3316880	3317880	Yes.
3317880	3318880	The Colbert Report.
3318880	3319880	Good for you!
3319880	3320880	Alright.
3320880	3321880	Here you go.
3321880	3326680	Because, um, Stephen Colbert is going to have a song in Rock Band.
3326680	3327680	Awesome.
3327680	3334160	Yes, um, Charlene is going to be available as a free download for Rock Band so everyone
3334160	3335640	has to go get it right now.
3335640	3337720	Yes, it is actually available now.
3337720	3338720	Yes.
3338720	3340560	But it's one of those blink and you miss it things.
3340560	3341560	Get it!
3341560	3344420	Yeah, because if you go into Rock Band you won't see it in the new releases.
3344420	3346040	It's only in the library.
3346040	3350840	And if anyone wants to familiarize themselves with it, while they already should be, except
3350840	3354200	that I'm not really all that familiar with it, um, you can actually watch the video on
3354200	3355880	YouTube as well.
3355880	3359480	So go watch it after the show.
3359480	3362840	The song's only like a minute long and it's not that difficult either.
3362840	3366160	I've heard people are getting their achievements with it.
3366160	3368200	All the more random.
3368200	3370240	The lyrics are very funny.
3370240	3373600	It enables the players to achieve more.
3373600	3376080	Actually, we can play a little clip from Charlene.
3376080	3377080	It's only like a minute long.
3377080	3378080	Please do.
3378080	3379080	I'm near you, I think of you.
3379080	3380080	I think of you when I dream of you and I'm taking pictures of you.
3380080	3390080	I think of you when I'm in a blimp looking down from up above you.
3390080	3396680	You know I'm missing you.
3396680	3398240	I love the synthesizer in this song.
3398240	3399240	My mind is kissing you.
3399240	3405360	I'm right behind you now, Charlene, waiting one last time.
3405360	3406360	Oh, nice.
3406360	3407360	Reminds me of my ex.
3407360	3408360	All right.
3408360	3410360	Oh my god, that's so wrong.
3410360	3411760	There you have it.
3411760	3412760	So wrong.
3412760	3413760	Oh my god.
3413760	3416920	There'll be a couple people listening to the show that understand that.
3416920	3418560	All right, let's move on quickly.
3418560	3423120	Anyway, speaking of appealing to a broader audience, SingStar is releasing a country
3423120	3432320	version which will be coming to the PlayStation 2 on October 28th, and you can find, I guess,
3432320	3443560	songs from Kelly Pickler, Keith Urban, Montgomery, Gentry, and among others.
3443560	3445800	And yeah, it's kind of interesting.
3445800	3450760	Also they're going to be localizing SingStar Legends as well, which is supposed to be coming
3450760	3455520	out the same day, and that has a bunch of pop legend stuff.
3455520	3462720	You can probably guess that all your favorite stuff, maybe some Cher thrown in there.
3462720	3463720	Oh, hooray.
3463720	3465880	Yeah, because you can't have enough Cher.
3465880	3466880	Never.
3466880	3467880	Never.
3467880	3468880	Never.
3468880	3470160	So that's pretty much what's going on in SingStar World?
3470160	3473400	Yes, lots of releases for SingStar on PlayStation 2.
3473400	3476380	However, you can import all that stuff into your PS3.
3476380	3477920	How dare you?
3477920	3479680	How dare you, Loki?
3479680	3487040	How dare you talk about SingStar and not talk about the most important announcement of all
3487040	3488260	time?
3488260	3494360	This is the greatest moment in video game history happened this week around SingStar,
3494360	3496000	and Loki just somehow missed it.
3496000	3497980	It's a decider who wins the console war, right?
3497980	3506760	The console war has been won this week by Sony PlayStation 3, and it's all because of
3506760	3512120	ABBA.
3512120	3513120	That's right.
3513120	3519160	SingStar ABBA was announced this week by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe for release
3519160	3526440	on the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 3 later this year, and so you can sing hits
3526440	3527440	like Waterloo.
3527440	3539760	Let's take a listen.
3539760	3544760	This was one of those moments, and then God spoke, and he said, let there be ABBA, and
3544760	3547680	there was, and Sony won the war.
3547680	3550280	There it is.
3550280	3554600	I mean, let's just end the fucking show, because there's no other news that's going to top
3554600	3555600	this.
3555600	3556600	Does that mean we can go home now?
3556600	3559240	I don't know why, but it's just going to be pathetic.
3559240	3561480	Well, I don't know.
3561480	3564320	I still think that my story was the best story ever.
3564320	3565920	Well, Stephen Colbert is pretty cool.
3565920	3566920	We'll try, Rob.
3566920	3567920	Try to find something fun.
3567920	3568920	I will find something fun.
3568920	3570080	Let's talk about DJ Hero.
3570080	3573460	There's a lot of people that are very excited about DJ Hero, because they think it's going
3573460	3574460	to be BeatMania 2DX.
3574460	3579960	It's going to be like, you know, the answer to BeatMania 2DX by the folks who did Guitar
3579960	3580960	Hero.
3580960	3587800	Well, you'd be kind of like half right, because it's not really going to be like BeatMania
3587800	3588800	2DX.
3588800	3592520	If you were thinking of a controller with a turntable and five buttons, not really.
3592520	3595060	It actually sounds like it's going to be a lot different.
3595060	3602160	Some information has leaked from inside sources of a new pioneer little hookup for this thing.
3602160	3605880	I guess this is just a mockup, but this is to get you to think of what it would look
3605880	3606880	like.
3606880	3610360	So if you imagine one of these things, you could hit this little turntable, and there's
3610360	3613080	actually going to be little effector buttons on it.
3613080	3615160	It's like a version of one of those type of decks.
3615160	3619880	You use these little effector buttons and a crossfader to actually drop samples.
3619880	3624560	So if you ever thought, like, hey, BeatMania isn't really like DJing, now you have a game
3624560	3628160	that is actually kind of DJing, you know what I mean?
3628160	3629160	Which is kind of cool.
3629160	3631400	Well, I think it's different.
3631400	3632400	It's different, right?
3632400	3633400	No, it's not.
3633400	3634400	Why?
3634400	3635400	Why are you so negative?
3635400	3638880	Okay, well, the description that they had for this is basically, the screen's going
3638880	3643440	to be set up where you're going to see kind of like a bottom half of a record, and the
3643440	3648160	notes or whatever will be coming along, I guess, like three different tracks, and basically
3648160	3651760	you have to hold those effector buttons down while you scratch.
3651760	3652760	Hmm.
3652760	3653760	Let's see here.
3653760	3659680	If we take the scratch and replace it with strum, and we turn the effector buttons into
3659680	3662500	fret buttons, we have Guitar Hero.
3662500	3666440	So really, it's just re-skinning Guitar Hero to put different music in it.
3666440	3667440	Well, but in a way, but think about this.
3667440	3668440	This does sound kind of cool.
3668440	3672320	Let's say the wireless controller apparently is actually grooved to fit in your lap, so
3672320	3675000	you can actually sit this thing in your lap and play with it in your lap, which is kind
3675000	3676000	of cool.
3676000	3677000	And then get this.
3677000	3679720	Apparently, now this is the part where I have to spend a little disbelief.
3679720	3682920	I think this is wishful thinking, but if it's true, it's pretty awesome.
3682920	3687280	Apparently, the game song list is all mashups.
3687280	3689600	Like it's all band versus band.
3689600	3690600	Like what was that?
3690600	3691680	Like the Grey Album, right?
3691680	3692680	Metallica versus Beatles.
3692680	3696140	Remember that was like a really famous mashup that supposedly...
3696140	3698200	The Grey Album was Jay-Z and the Beatles.
3698200	3699200	Oh, never mind.
3699200	3700200	Sorry.
3700200	3701200	Jay-Z.
3701200	3702200	Because I'm thinking of Metallica's Black Album.
3702200	3704200	I know it was like a Black Album mixed with a White Album.
3704200	3706400	But think of those types of things.
3706400	3710200	It's supposed to be mashups is going to be the whole song list.
3710200	3711200	You like mashups, don't you, Loki?
3711200	3713000	I thought you loved that kind of stuff.
3713000	3714000	I don't know.
3714000	3715400	I think this game is going to be...
3715400	3721680	People will probably buy it because it's something that Activision is putting out, but I think
3721680	3722680	it's going to be...
3722680	3726280	If you're thinking it's going to be 2DX, you're going to be sorely disappointed.
3726280	3727920	Well, we'll see what happens.
3727920	3731520	No, it's not going to be 2DX, but it sounds like it could be cool.
3731520	3734760	I don't necessarily need a copy of a game that's already out there and still selling
3734760	3735760	in Japan.
3735760	3736760	You know what I mean?
3736760	3739360	I like the fact that it's kind of different.
3739360	3743240	And they're also saying that they're supposed to do guitar co-op as well.
3743240	3744240	I don't know.
3744240	3748960	We'll have to see how it actually plays out, but I'm not too optimistic yet.
3748960	3753140	What's interesting and possibly related is that almost within the same breath, Activision
3753140	3755720	announced this week that they have acquired Freestyle Games.
3755720	3760840	It's a UK-based developer, and they made the game B-Boy, which was on the PSP.
3760840	3763800	I don't think it really sold like crazy, but it was a rhythm action game that was available
3763800	3765040	on the PSP.
3765040	3769320	And apparently what they're doing is they're developing a new music-based IP.
3769320	3770320	Hmm...
3770320	3771320	B-Boy?
3771320	3773320	DJ Hero?
3773320	3774320	Connection?
3774320	3777040	Who knows?
3777040	3782020	But it certainly is interesting that Freestyle Games was sucked into the Activision collective
3782020	3783020	this week.
3783020	3784020	So there you go.
3784020	3786160	People will eat this up.
3786160	3789680	As long as you do something innovative with it, you know, if you can mix actual MP3s or
3789680	3791400	something like that, that might be kind of cool.
3791400	3799960	But somehow I'm gonna set the bar a lot lower than, you know, I would like it to be.
3799960	3803080	By the way, B-Boy was not just available on the PlayStation Portable, it is available
3803080	3804800	on PlayStation 2 also in the United States.
3804800	3807320	Yeah, it got released here a couple weeks ago.
3807320	3809920	But it was probably one of those, again, kind of blink-and-you-miss-it sort of things.
3809920	3810920	It was an alright game.
3810920	3811920	Was it?
3811920	3812920	I mean, it was okay.
3812920	3813920	I had never even heard of it.
3813920	3814920	You guys say blink-and-miss-it because I missed it.
3814920	3819040	I played the PSP, the UK version of the PSP game a while back, and it was alright.
3819040	3822560	It wasn't a lot to hold my attention for a long time, but it was pretty cool.
3822560	3823560	Alright.
3823560	3824560	Fair enough.
3824560	3825560	Alright.
3825560	3826560	Well, there you have it.
3826560	3827560	We'll see.
3827560	3829000	More information on DJ Hero may be made by these guys.
3829000	3830000	We'll see.
3830000	3833480	Well, Sony is not happy.
3833480	3834480	Not happy at all.
3834480	3835480	Why?
3835480	3836480	They should be elated.
3836480	3837480	They have ABBA.
3837480	3840440	Yeah, but the PSP people aren't happy.
3840440	3841440	They want it all.
3841440	3844560	And, I mean, as if ABBA wasn't big enough, they want everything.
3844560	3847420	They want third-party support for the PSP.
3847420	3849760	They're not very happy with it.
3849760	3858560	Basically, the boss of Sony Worldwide Studios, Yoshida Shuhei, is basically saying that they'd
3858560	3865120	like to see more third-party support on the PSP and that they're jealous because other
3865120	3869400	people are getting third-party support and not them.
3869400	3871520	He's quoted as saying it's really, really disappointing.
3871520	3874240	I mean, it's so disappointing he had to use really twice.
3874240	3875240	What?
3875240	3877640	It didn't get the point across.
3877640	3880160	And it's a lost opportunity for the third parties.
3880160	3885480	They should look at what the PSP can do for their titles and the potential for the business
3885480	3888940	that their IP has.
3888940	3894640	They say, though, that Sony's got a whole bunch more things ready, but they are really
3894640	3897560	wanting Capcom, maybe?
3897560	3901680	But you know, the PSP 3000 is on its way.
3901680	3905680	You know, I have the feeling that they're forgetting that there's a reason why there's
3905680	3910320	developers not making games for the PSP because they've made games on the PSP in the past
3910320	3912600	and they haven't sold well at all.
3912600	3914240	I mean, that's kind of what it is.
3914240	3917840	A lot of people are avoiding the PSP and not that it's a bad system.
3917840	3918840	It's just...
3918840	3920500	The DS is more fun.
3920500	3921500	Not even that.
3921500	3922680	I wouldn't even go that far.
3922680	3928000	It's just, there's a lot more people that own the DS because they're suckered into buying
3928000	3932360	multiple colors for it, or God knows what.
3932360	3933360	I don't know.
3933360	3935520	I like the PSP a lot better than the DS, but I...
3935520	3938520	But if you go back to that rule that a system is only as good as the games that are on it...
3938520	3939520	Exactly.
3939520	3941840	There's better games on DS in general, so people are going to go where the good games
3941840	3942840	are.
3942840	3945660	And in a way, this is what Sony's complaining about, is that the third parties aren't giving
3945660	3947440	them what they need to sustain.
3947440	3950400	Well, maybe start supporting the third parties a little bit more.
3950400	3955880	Maybe do some innovative features to the PSP, like, you know, make voice chat a lot easier.
3955880	3958960	Now that they have the microphone built in, they can do some stuff with that.
3958960	3959960	Touchscreen.
3959960	3962000	That might be kind of cool.
3962000	3964880	Tilt sensors.
3964880	3968840	I always kind of thought that the PSP's strength over the DS was that it was more of a kind
3968840	3970140	of all-in-one type system.
3970140	3973080	It was like part iPod, part game player, part web browser.
3973080	3975320	It's just a little bit of everything for relatively low price.
3975320	3976320	It depends on what you want, and if you...
3976320	3980680	Like, for me, I have absolutely no reason to really play a PSP much except for a couple
3980680	3982100	of games, really.
3982100	3985880	If I was in high school, though, all over again, I would be all over this PSP.
3985880	3988600	I mean, this would be a great thing to take to high school, I think, because you got it
3988600	3989600	all right there.
3989600	3993040	Well, when I was in high school, it was the Atari Lynx.
3993040	3994920	Wow, if that.
3994920	3996000	I didn't have one of those.
3996000	3997120	I had a Game Boy Brick.
3997120	3998920	Actually, it was the Turbo Express.
3998920	4000640	I had a Game Boy Brick and a brick...
4000640	4001640	And a Game Boy Brick.
4001640	4005320	A gray case that I hauled it around in, it got stolen.
4005320	4009200	I had a Game Boy Brick and a friend of mine had a Turbo Express.
4009200	4012680	I was like, cool, I want one.
4012680	4013680	But anyway.
4013680	4014680	Hmm.
4014680	4018720	Well, there's some other good things, though, coming to the PSP, and I know we don't talk
4018720	4024760	about it too much, but they actually have a lot of games now on their PC store that
4024760	4026800	you can download the full versions of.
4026800	4032520	It's almost like a digital version of it, kind of like what they do with the PS1 Classics,
4032520	4034600	included this new lineup of stuff.
4034600	4040720	You're going to have Cube, Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords for $14.99, which is not bad.
4040720	4042880	Work Time Fun for $10.
4042880	4050040	You get PQ, PQ2, that one game that's kind of like IQ, the first one for $9.99, the second
4050040	4055860	one for $14.99, and Deadhead Fred, which is kind of a sleeper game for $15.
4055860	4061520	So they are releasing quite a bit of stuff on the PC store.
4061520	4065200	I kind of think it's funny, though, that they have digital copies of it now, because, I
4065200	4069760	mean, people have been doing that before in not such a legit way.
4069760	4072480	But now they're encouraging it.
4072480	4075680	And by the way, if you're listening to this show on a PSP, which a lot of our emailers
4075680	4080040	and so on have told us that they do, you need to, like, pause the podcast right now, and
4080040	4085240	you need to go to OLRPSP.com in your browser and check out the new Orange Lounge Radio
4085240	4089680	All Games Tuner that's available on the downloads page there, because it's quite awesome.
4089680	4093680	And we'll allow you to listen to the All Games Radio live feed right there from your crossbar
4093680	4095920	without having to, like, hunt around for it.
4095920	4098440	It's like one-click access to the show, which is great.
4098440	4100800	It's great for you, because you find quality gaming radio fast.
4100800	4102920	It's great for us, because we get more listeners easily.
4102920	4107440	So install it on your friends' PSPs, too.
4107440	4109000	Get their permission first, though.
4109000	4110000	That's the nice thing to do.
4110000	4111000	But, you know.
4111000	4112000	You know, it's funny.
4112000	4113400	Someone jokes about SingStar for PSP.
4113400	4117680	I wouldn't doubt that they may have something like that in the future.
4117680	4118680	Hmm.
4118680	4119680	Interesting.
4119680	4120680	We'll see.
4120680	4121680	All right.
4121680	4122680	Let's see.
4122680	4127720	Moving on to another Sony-related story, and this is the type of game a lot of folks can
4127720	4128720	get into.
4128720	4129720	It's Kingdom Hearts.
4129720	4133080	And a lot of people have kind of been wondering, when's the next Kingdom Hearts game gonna
4133080	4134080	come out?
4134080	4135400	Where's our information on Kingdom Hearts 3?
4135400	4136760	Well, sadly, we don't have that.
4136760	4140600	But what we did get from this week's GameStop Expo, which is kind of a meeting of all the
4140600	4142960	important people at GameStop, happened this week.
4142960	4147120	Apparently, a little piece slipped out about Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.
4147120	4150960	You might remember that this was a Game Boy Advance game that got released on the PlayStation
4150960	4154960	2 in Japan as part of a Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix type thing that came out.
4154960	4156440	It was like a bonus disc.
4156440	4159560	And it kind of was forgotten about and never was released over here.
4159560	4164660	Until now, apparently, Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, it is going to be coming to the
4164660	4166200	US.
4166200	4171260	There was a small mention of Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories at Square Enix's presentation.
4171260	4175240	When they were asked if it was the same one that was Final Mix 2 in Japan, they did confirm
4175240	4176240	it with a nod.
4176240	4180240	There hasn't been an official announcement through Square, just this small mention.
4180240	4183360	So I guess you should take it with a little bit of a grain of salt.
4183360	4187480	But apparently, if you tie things together, back in July, Squeenix was hiring an English
4187480	4188640	voice cast.
4188640	4191200	So probably to go for this game.
4191200	4196640	Although that could also be for Final Fantasy 13, but who knows?
4196640	4198840	I would think, why not release this game here?
4198840	4201240	I mean, certainly, there's an audience for it.
4201240	4207080	But, you know, they usually don't pay attention to everybody, do they?
4207080	4208080	Who knows?
4208080	4209080	It is Squeenix.
4209080	4213080	They have gotten a lot more friendly about the whole worldwide releases and all that
4213080	4214080	fun stuff.
4214080	4215320	Well, let's hope.
4215320	4216320	Let's indeed hope.
4216320	4220520	Well, let's hope that Dark Sakura has dug through the archives this week and picked
4220520	4223100	an awesome Classic Game of the Week this week.
4223100	4224560	Have you done so, Dark Sakura?
4224560	4225920	I'd like to think that I have.
4225920	4227080	All right, well, let's get to it.
4227080	4232680	Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week, the way we end Part A every week here on our lovely
4232680	4234560	program here at Orange Launch Radio.
4234560	4237920	What should the kids be playing this week?
4237920	4241160	The Classic Game of the Week came out on Super Nintendo.
4241160	4246160	It is one of the Mario franchises, and it is Mario Paint.
4246160	4247680	Awesome.
4247680	4254640	Mario Paint uses the SNES mouse that came with it, and it basically is a little drawing
4254640	4256320	program for the most part.
4256320	4262240	I mean, it basically is like Microsoft Paint, but the...
4262240	4270880	I don't really want to go too much into the more, you know, structured part of the game.
4270880	4272960	Let's go into what's playing in the background.
4272960	4278240	This is a little clip from F-Zero that somebody has put into the little music maker in Mario
4278240	4279240	Paint.
4279240	4290560	Well, right, it did actually have a music program in there, and you could actually save
4290560	4292920	things onto...
4292920	4296280	I do believe that you could actually tape them, but it was very weird.
4296280	4299880	A lot of these are more, you know, these days are done through an emulator now.
4299880	4307240	But there was, going back to the art side of it, you could actually make stamps, and
4307240	4312200	it came with stamps in it too, and that was cool, but you had 30 different colors, 60
4312200	4319960	different textures and patterns, 75 different stamps, 15 customizable stamps, battery backup,
4319960	4325000	and special erasers like the fade erase, water erase, where the picture becomes a grayscale
4325000	4326000	and vanishes.
4326000	4331360	Timed erase, rain erase, split image erase, pixelated erase, blinds erase, rocket erase,
4331360	4332360	and abrupt erase.
4332360	4347240	I'm just imagining, but here in the background, we have Dragon Force.
4347240	4350720	I think this cheated a little bit though, this is using one of those external Mario
4350720	4354040	Paint emulator things, but yeah, same idea.
4354040	4358160	I know, I included basically a lot of those just because I thought they were fun.
4358160	4364760	But yeah, there were the mini games called, a fly swatting game called Coffee Break or
4364760	4372200	Nat Attack, and you played as the glove hand, which as we all know was the boss in the Smash
4372200	4374600	Brothers games, right?
4374600	4377860	And it holds a fly swatter, and it has to swat things.
4377860	4381920	I love Nat Attack.
4381920	4389040	There was also a little mini game on the title screen, where you could click the letters
4389040	4394400	to have a certain sequence of actions go on, and then you could change the music, I'd have
4394400	4397640	Yoshi show up, and paint the background.
4397640	4404200	And also, this is a game that has a particular, yeah I put Power Rangers on it too because
4404200	4405800	it's funny.
4405800	4411840	But have you ever heard of Totoka's song, Rob?
4411840	4412840	No.
4412840	4419080	Kazumi Totoka was the guy who did a lot of Nintendo music, and there's a song that is
4419080	4424060	like basically his little nineteen note song that shows up in all the games he does stuff
4424060	4428400	on his little easter egg, and it shows up, oh I have heard of that.
4428400	4429400	I have heard of that, yes.
4429400	4434320	But for anyone who doesn't know, on Animal Crossing, it actually was KK's song, in Animal
4434320	4435320	Crossing.
4435320	4441880	So, I just wanted, you know, it was actually the, when you click the letter O in Mario
4441880	4442880	Paint, the song plays.
4442880	4446960	And for anyone who doesn't know, it was actually, the first appearance of it was in a Game Boy
4446960	4447960	game called X.
4447960	4455600	It was only out in Japan, unless you happened to either import or use ROMs.
4455600	4467320	So Mario Paint is, another, has another pop culture, oh yeah.
4467320	4473440	This is the song, Air Man, Taos and I, I think, yeah.
4473440	4476320	I don't want to point out, this one is done in a legitimate Mario Paint.
4476320	4477320	Yeah, that one was.
4477320	4480920	And I thought it was very well done.
4480920	4487560	But anyway, the first episode of Homestar Runner was animated in Mario Paint.
4487560	4489360	That's so awesome.
4489360	4491040	There have been sequels.
4491040	4497760	There was one on the Nintendo 64 double D called Mario Artist, which was a launch title,
4497760	4503560	and it brought out the mouse for the Nintendo 64, and it was to make 3D polygonal models,
4503560	4511280	and you could actually insert images onto these 3D models using the Nintendo 64 capture
4511280	4516160	cartridge and then show everyone, show your work with the communication kit online.
4516160	4521040	Although we didn't, of course, get that over here, but Mario Paint did have a sort of appearance
4521040	4523720	in WarioWare Touched as Wario Paint.
4523720	4524720	Nice.
4524720	4527960	And you had the turntable and the toy room and all that.
4527960	4535260	And the most fun game was in WarioWare Mega Microgames, and Wii Photo Channel has an editing
4535260	4537840	system that's similar to Mario Paint.
4537840	4543320	And then, like we were mentioning before, there have been stand-alone applications of
4543320	4544320	the music program.
4544320	4548320	And I had to put that one on there.
4548320	4554240	You've been paint-rolled, lol.
4554240	4557320	So the game is Wario Paint.
4557320	4558880	It is your classic game of the week.
4558880	4564720	Mario Paint, available on the Super Nintendo, with yet another one of Nintendo's famous
4564720	4566720	peripherals, the mouse.
4566720	4567720	And the mouse...
4567720	4568720	It was only on one game.
4568720	4569720	No, no, it was one other.
4569720	4571720	I want to say there was one other game that you could use it with.
4571720	4573880	I think you could also use it on the gun games.
4573880	4574880	I don't remember.
4574880	4578400	I want to say, couldn't you use it on Lemmings you could use it on?
4578400	4579400	Lemmings.
4579400	4580400	Lemmings you could.
4580400	4581400	Lemmings was one.
4581400	4584400	In fact, I think I remember that actually being sort of a feature of it, wasn't it?
4584400	4585400	I think so.
4585400	4587520	I kind of irritated me, though.
4587520	4588520	Anyway, that's it.
4588520	4589520	There you go.
4589520	4590520	Classic game of the week.
4590520	4595080	All right, that's going to do it for part A of our show tonight, but stay tuned.
4595080	4596080	There's plenty more to come.
4596080	4597440	We're only halfway there.
4597440	4601640	In part B tonight, your phone calls and more news, including some updates on Mortal Kombat
4601640	4607760	versus DC Universe, Batman Arkham Asylum, and some news about Capcom, and some more
4607760	4609960	Xbox bundles coming soon.
4609960	4613320	So we're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back in just a little bit with more
4613320	4621800	of Orange Lounge Radio.
4621800	4626120	So you've got a bunch of websites and podcasts about anime, manga, or video games, but you
4626120	4629360	just don't have the time to read and listen to them all.

4672080	4680880	The Antigamers podcast, because we all need another anime and gaming podcast, right?
4680880	4684000	Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here.
4684000	4688040	Recently I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on Xbox Live.
4688040	4690160	You always can't suck my fucking dick.
4690160	4691640	I just got a dick in your ass.
4691640	4693560	Do you like that dick in your butt, Ken?
4693560	4694560	Where's Barbie?
4694560	4695560	Yeah, where's Barbie?
4695560	4696560	Is that Urkel?
4696560	4697560	Urkel's your Barbie, huh?
4697560	4698560	Is she in Malibu or no?
4698560	4701920	Please, stop spewing hate speech on Xbox Live.
4701920	4706680	It doesn't make you look cool, it won't get you any friends, and at the end of the day,
4706680	4709960	you still have an incredibly small penis.
4709960	4733920	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4733920	4737440	That's a little old school bumper bringing us back there.
4737440	4740760	That is like a million different people yelling out acronyms, I still don't know what they
4740760	4741760	mean to this day.
4741760	4743800	That was Megumi doing GGPO.
4743800	4744800	What does that even mean?
4744800	4745800	Good game, peace out.
4745800	4746800	Oh, okay.
4746800	4747800	Oh, nice.
4747800	4748800	All right.
4748800	4749800	There you go.
4749800	4753000	All right, so yeah, those are our friends in Step Squad.
4753000	4755200	Is there still a Step Squad that plays DDR?
4755200	4760560	I'm sure Step Squad is still around, although honestly, the last time I saw Jahi, every
4760560	4766400	time I ever see him is like randomly in Japantown, like when I'm not even trying, and I ran into
4766400	4772080	Wendell at Fonome last year, and I've seen him a few times recently, and once at Yowie
4772080	4773080	Con.
4773080	4774080	Nice.
4774080	4775080	Very nice.
4775080	4777520	I think he was working security or something.
4777520	4778840	All right.
4778840	4779840	Very cool.
4779840	4785120	VXJ6V is in chat and says, I asked that four years ago when I was on the show, and I guess
4785120	4786840	I forgot what GGPO means.
4786840	4787840	My bad.
4787840	4788840	Nice.
4788840	4789840	What, Logie?
4789840	4793080	Before we started the second half here, I wanted to mention something I mentioned to
4793080	4797160	you yesterday.
4797160	4808000	We all got 14 day trials to World of Warcraft from PAX, and my wife wants to try Warcraft.
4808000	4809840	Oh my god.
4809840	4812680	The rapture is coming.
4812680	4813680	Start praying.
4813680	4814680	Wow.
4814680	4815680	Is she really going to do it?
4815680	4816680	I think she is.
4816680	4817680	Actually, go ahead.
4817680	4821520	I was going to say, she hates games, but she's going to start playing WoW.
4821520	4824800	Well, she's going to try the 14 day trial.
4824800	4825800	Wow.
4825800	4826800	Amazing.
4826800	4830280	We also, I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun a little bit for emails.
4830280	4831280	Sure.
4831280	4832280	Sure.
4832280	4833280	We got one from Sakura Max.
4833280	4834280	This is from my cell phone.
4834280	4835280	I survived the hurricane.
4835280	4836280	No electricity.
4836280	4837280	Minimal damage to my house.
4837280	4838280	Thank you.
4838280	4839280	Ah, yes.
4839280	4840280	Thank you for reminding.
4840280	4845120	There was that horrible hurricane that happened, and we hope any listener who is potentially
4845120	4847540	impacted by that is doing okay.
4847540	4852440	From what I hear, it's a lot of really, really bad damage, but I don't know.
4852440	4854920	I hope I don't make an ass out of myself, but last time I checked, it didn't sound like
4854920	4858920	the fatalities were nearly as bad as the last time we had a major hurricane in this country,
4858920	4861520	so I guess that's progress.
4861520	4865900	It's still very unfortunate, but I hope all of our listeners are a-okay.
4865900	4870080	It sounds like most people got out of there in time, so hopefully people packed their
4870080	4873840	stuff up and got out of there, and remember, stuff is stuff.
4873840	4875360	Stuff is just stuff.
4875360	4876360	Yep.
4876360	4878520	So, best of luck to all those folks.
4878520	4882240	And it's still moving through other parts of the country, through the Midwest, and so
4882240	4884240	on, so we hope everybody's doing okay.
4884240	4887040	But now it's just a tropical depression or whatever.
4887040	4892440	And to respond to Chat Room, I'm not necessarily encouraging her to play.
4892440	4896800	That's something she wants to try, because everyone keeps talking about it.
4896800	4898040	She feels left out.
4898040	4903040	Personally, I don't know if I would start playing, because I don't know if I'd want
4903040	4904040	to.
4904040	4908240	Sharon in Chat has a very strong opinion, if Loki wants to help Nellie with World of
4908240	4913080	Warcraft, he should just get her a real RPG instead, oo-burn.
4913080	4915480	She doesn't have the patience for that stuff.
4915480	4919280	For the record, I actually, um, I'm not going back in the Chat Room because I keep getting
4919280	4920280	dropped.
4920280	4921280	Doh.
4921280	4923960	Yeah, we're having some network problems here in studio.
4923960	4924960	It's annoying!
4924960	4929760	Just another night here at OLR, so I guess maybe somebody will be buying me a new router
4929760	4930760	soon.
4930760	4931760	I don't know.
4931760	4936080	Moving on, we're going to get into some gaming news tonight, here at Orange Launch Radio,
4936080	4937320	some more.
4937320	4940480	We haven't even talked at all, really, about Xbox 360 news, and I think that's where we're
4940480	4942160	going to start tonight, right, Loki?
4942160	4943160	Yep.
4943160	4948800	There was, of course, some rumors coming out of PAX about a possible new Halo game coming
4948800	4953500	out, and then people realized, oh, it's just the map pack, and there was new achievements
4953500	4955320	that got leaked out, and all that fun stuff.
4955320	4959140	Well, those new achievements have been confirmed as actual achievements that will be coming
4959140	4968840	to Halo 3, and they're coming to Halo 3 later this month, so you can expect for, I guess,
4968840	4973280	I don't know how many new points they're going to add to it, but a whole bunch of new achievements.
4973280	4978160	I guess they come out with a new map pack, so that'd be kind of neat.
4978160	4980640	And it's part of their title update, too.
4980640	4982860	Well, hooray for them doing a big update.
4982860	4983860	It's going to be free?
4983860	4984860	Yes.
4984860	4985860	We hope.
4985860	4986860	Awesome.
4986860	4987860	The update will be free.
4987860	4990520	It's going to be free, but map pack, probably not.
4990520	4995400	But remember, and not to discourage people buying it, but remember all those other map
4995400	4996400	packs that they had out there?
4996400	4998920	Well, those eventually become free anyway, so...
4998920	4999920	Dope.
4999920	5001920	Yeah, it's a rental.
5001920	5002920	Alright.
5002920	5008840	Well, hey, if Halo 3 is not your cup of tea, maybe you're more of a fighting game fan,
5008840	5011960	and you're looking forward to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, which we talked about last
5011960	5016100	week here on the show post PAX, because they had a playable on the show floor at PAX, and
5016100	5020080	it was big, dumb fun, is what it was, I would call it.
5020080	5025840	Well, unfortunately, some of the big, dumb fun has been ruined this week, thanks to a
5025840	5028480	leaked list of achievements.
5028480	5032560	Xbox360achievements.org, hey, you know what, they were just doing their job, that's what
5032560	5035040	they do, they uncover achievements as soon as they find out about them.
5035040	5040000	Well, it turns out the achievement list spoils the entire character roster from Mortal Kombat
5040000	5041000	vs. DC Universe.
5041000	5042000	Yay!
5042000	5043440	So now we know who's in the game.
5043440	5047400	And you know, Midway kind of danced around this, obviously, you know someone was pissed,
5047400	5051580	you know somebody's heads was rolling after this, they initially said, we have not officially
5051580	5056520	released it, and then they came back and said, yeah, okay, it's true, dongle between our
5056520	5058560	legs, run away, yipe yipe yipe.
5058560	5065400	Alright, so here's the characters from Mortal Kombat, Baraka, Jax, Kano, Katana, Liu Kang,
5065400	5070840	Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, Sonya, and Sub-Zero.
5070840	5075760	So a pretty good list, that's pretty much the Mortal Kombat 2 roster without Mileena
5075760	5076760	and...
5076760	5080480	Well, they said, they also said that that might not be everybody.
5080480	5083900	True, they could always do download characters and so on, right?
5083900	5085920	Or there's characters that just don't have achievements.
5085920	5086920	Right, right.
5086920	5090880	And there's one other character missing too, god, why can't I remember his name, the guy
5090880	5093120	with the hat that cut people down the middle.
5093120	5094120	Oh, Kung Lao.
5094120	5096520	Kung Lao, he's not in there either.
5096520	5098920	DC Universe.
5098920	5099920	And no reptile either.
5099920	5103320	Alright, DC Universe, this is the stuff people really, really care about, I'm sure, the comic
5103320	5104320	book characters.
5104320	5106320	Here's who's coming from DC Universe.
5106320	5108320	Batman, what's that?
5108320	5111800	Nothing, I'm just, it's a pet peeve, that's okay, keep going.
5111800	5112800	Oh, okay.
5112800	5113800	DC Universe has...
5113800	5114800	I'll say it when you say his name.
5114800	5120360	Batman, Catwoman, Dark Seed, Deathstroke, I think it's Dark Side.
5120360	5127720	Dark Side, Flash, sorry, you know what a comic book fan I am, Flash, Green Lantern, The Joker,
5127720	5131600	Lex Luthor, Shazam, Superman, and Wonder Woman.
5131600	5137160	You know, it's funny, every time I hear Shazam, I think Kazaam, and I'm like...
5137160	5138640	It's Captain Marvel.
5138640	5139640	Okay.
5139640	5141920	Wait, why did they...
5141920	5144640	Because that's what all of his books were called.
5144640	5145960	Oh, okay.
5145960	5146960	I see.
5146960	5150360	Well, but that's what they're going to refer to him as in the game, probably, I guess,
5150360	5153820	because if they're pulling this off the achievement list, they must be referring to him as that
5153820	5157400	in the game, so, interesting.
5157400	5158400	There you go.
5158400	5163320	Well, I'm excited, now we can finally throw down Wonder Woman vs. Catwoman, that'll be
5163320	5164320	awesome.
5164320	5165960	Looking forward to that.
5165960	5171440	Oh, this game comes out soon, be on the lookout for it, it'll be out before the holidays.
5171440	5172440	And there you go.
5172440	5173440	I don't know.
5173440	5174680	November 19th, if I remember correctly.
5174680	5175680	Is that it?
5175680	5176680	All right.
5176680	5177680	Just in time for Thanksgiving.
5177680	5181360	I just wish they'd have other unlockable characters later on, that would be neat.
5181360	5184160	They may, and they may have pay-to-unlock characters, who knows.
5184160	5187880	You know, this is the first Mortal Kombat on the next-gen system, am I right?
5187880	5188880	Yeah.
5188880	5192800	Yeah, so who knows, they might have the downloadable characters, that'd be kind of cool.
5192800	5199040	Well speaking of stuff related to the DC Universe, this personally makes me giddy.
5199040	5203200	I mean, crazy loony giddy.
5203200	5208000	For the game Batman Arkham Asylum, they are getting Mark Hamill to play Joker.
5208000	5213280	And that makes me happy, because as far as anyone who has ever voiced the Joker, Mark
5213280	5214520	Hamill is the one.
5214520	5215520	I'm sorry.
5215520	5219520	When I think Joker, I think, you know, when I'm not thinking of the comic books, I'm thinking
5219520	5224080	of animated series Joker, just because he's so goofball, I think is cool.
5224080	5226480	You don't think about the movies, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, or any of that?
5226480	5228000	I have not seen Dark Knight, remember?
5228000	5229000	Oh wow, all right.
5229000	5230440	I'm going to see it in IMAX.
5230440	5232000	It was pretty impressive, I gotta say.
5232000	5233320	I'm going to see it in IMAX.
5233320	5234320	It's here, inside.
5234320	5235320	I know.
5235320	5236320	You gotta go see it.
5236320	5237320	When I go see it, it will be in IMAX.
5237320	5238320	All right.
5238320	5239320	Have fun.
5239320	5242360	But this makes me very, very, very, very giddy.
5242360	5247480	JackDeffDegrees in chatroom, chat.orangelandtrader.com, says, Mark Hamill is the Joker.
5247480	5250040	And Solid Goomba simply says, fuck yeah, Mark Hamill.
5250040	5252920	What is it about Mark Hamill that makes him so fucking amazing?
5252920	5255560	He does the best Joker, I'm sorry.
5255560	5261320	Then he was, what was it in Jay and Silent Bob Cockknocker?
5261320	5264280	Yes, he was also in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
5264280	5266560	But there's more news.
5266560	5268480	You could appear in the game.
5268480	5269480	Really?
5269480	5270480	Me?
5270480	5271480	There could be Rob in the game.
5271480	5272480	Little old me?
5272480	5273480	Little old me?
5273480	5278760	There is a contest right now from GI that will allow the winner to become an Arkham
5278760	5280000	inmate.
5280000	5283280	And you get your cell decked out with personal photos and wall scribbles.
5283280	5286160	That's more of a Loki role, don't you think?
5286160	5287760	I would be all over that.
5287760	5292840	And all of my graffiti would be, hello, hi, mom, I'm in jail.
5292840	5293840	I like it here.
5293840	5294840	It's nice.
5294840	5299560	I think, and I don't know if Travis still does this on Understandation Live, but maybe
5299560	5303000	my voice could be something like, I've been here for seven years.
5303000	5305440	The medication doesn't work.
5305440	5307340	Does he still do that on Understandation Live?
5307340	5308340	I don't even know.
5308340	5309340	That sounds weird.
5309340	5316360	Somebody, no, there was this old sound bite he used to play like all the freaking time
5316360	5319880	of this guy going, I've been here for seven years.
5319880	5320980	Forget it.
5320980	5321980	We should all audition.
5321980	5323900	Don't you want to be in a game as a crazy person?
5323900	5324900	Come on, Loki.
5324900	5325900	Admit it.
5325900	5329000	As long as I'm in a game as a crazy person.
5329000	5330480	There you go.
5330480	5333640	DJ Dark Knight says, I can't see Jamie being in jail.
5333640	5336400	Oh, how little you know, Jamie.
5336400	5338040	I've been in jail before.
5338040	5339040	Really?
5339040	5340040	Hi, dad.
5340040	5341040	I'm in jail.
5341040	5343040	Are we talking about like Sadie Hawkins dance jail?
5343040	5344040	No.
5344040	5345040	Really?
5345040	5346040	You went to the big house?
5346040	5347040	No, I went to the little house.
5347040	5348040	I ran away from home once.
5348040	5349040	Oh, okay.
5349040	5350040	Oh, awesome.
5350040	5351040	I never knew that.
5351040	5352040	Yep.
5352040	5353040	I ran away from home once.
5353040	5354040	Okay.
5354040	5355040	Hi, dad.
5355040	5358200	Did you have to make that phone call?
5358200	5359200	No, I'm in jail.
5359200	5360200	I like it here.
5360200	5361200	No.
5361200	5363200	There's like, just go sleep or read the Bible.
5363200	5364200	Alabama.
5364200	5366200	They make you either sleep or read the Bible.
5366200	5367600	Huh.
5367600	5369080	And then my mom came and got me.
5369080	5370080	So yeah.
5370080	5371080	Wow.
5371080	5372080	I never knew that.
5372080	5373080	Interesting.
5373080	5374080	Huh.
5374080	5377680	Six years and I never knew that Jamie was in jail.
5377680	5379960	There's quite a bit about me you don't know.
5379960	5380960	Apparently.
5380960	5382800	But now the internet knows.
5382800	5384320	It wasn't real jail.
5384320	5385320	Yeah, I know.
5385320	5386320	It wasn't real jail.
5386320	5387320	Okay.
5387320	5388320	All right.
5388320	5389320	Yes, Loki.
5389320	5396800	So, of course, with the announcement of the price drop last week, the Xbox sales numbers
5396800	5401760	are apparently doubling according to Microsoft and I guess we'll have to see when the MPT
5401760	5404680	numbers come out at the beginning of October.
5404680	5406640	But that's pretty promising.
5406640	5412840	I mean, not a big surprise that, I don't know, it's selling well when it's cheaper.
5412840	5416120	I mean, that's, I guess, a shocker to a lot of people.
5416120	5417800	No, wait, no it's not.
5417800	5418800	Is it Christmas yet?
5418800	5419800	Huh.
5419800	5422240	Well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens with this.
5422240	5423240	That's why I'm curious.
5423240	5424960	Is this a trend that's going to continue through Christmas?
5424960	5425960	I don't know.
5425960	5426960	All right.
5426960	5429840	Xbox 360 is now going to sell because everybody got a Wii last Christmas.
5429840	5430840	I don't know.
5430840	5431840	Who knows?
5431840	5438360	I still hear and it really irks me, not that I'm picking sides or anything, but...
5438360	5439360	But you are.
5439360	5440360	I'm not.
5440360	5441720	Yeah, really I'm not.
5441720	5445580	But when Sony comes out and like says, oh yeah, we're winning.
5445580	5448720	How are you winning when you have a quarter of the like market?
5448720	5449720	ABBA.
5449720	5450720	What?
5450720	5451720	ABBA.
5451720	5452720	No, no.
5452720	5455880	Listen, ABBA ain't going to do shit, okay?
5455880	5456880	Tell that to Rob.
5456880	5457880	Bite your tongue.
5457880	5458880	Tell that to Rob.
5458880	5459880	ABBA ain't going to do shit.
5459880	5460880	That's what I'm saying.
5460880	5461880	No one buys SingStar.
5461880	5462880	Okay?
5462880	5463880	Nobody.
5463880	5464880	Unless you're in Europe.
5464880	5465880	I hate you.
5465880	5466880	I don't know you anymore.
5466880	5467880	I disown you as a friend.
5467880	5468880	And you know what?
5468880	5469880	I thought Mamma Mia sucked.
5469880	5470880	No.
5470880	5471880	Get out of my house!
5471880	5481800	It just irks me when they say that they're winning, but it's like, dude, listen, you're
5481800	5483160	not even close to winning.
5483160	5489960	I mean, if you were like, you know, the Wii back in June when you were like 10,000 units
5489960	5493860	away from, you know, becoming number one, yeah, that's close to winning.
5493860	5497880	When you're millions of units behind, that's not close to winning, okay?
5497880	5500420	So don't talk that you're, you're going to do it.
5500420	5501760	You're going to do it by like year's end.
5501760	5502760	Or you're not.
5502760	5505440	You're not going to do it by year's end 2011, okay?
5505440	5506760	So stop it.
5506760	5507760	Seriously.
5507760	5512280	So are you saying that SingStar Abba's not going to sell well?
5512280	5517560	Would you care to make a little wager on SingStar Abba selling well or not?
5517560	5520080	No, I'm not.
5520080	5521200	What doesn't have to be Tingle?
5521200	5522960	I can think of far better punishments.
5522960	5524960	No, it's not.
5524960	5525960	Damn.
5525960	5529000	Everybody make chicken noises at Loki.
5529000	5531240	I'll think about it, but I'm pretty sure it's not.
5531240	5533520	Oh, he said, I think about it.
5533520	5535520	I got to do my research.
5535520	5536520	All right.
5536520	5538520	Rob, I will totally play SingStar with you.
5538520	5539520	I know.
5539520	5540960	You're getting the Abba one, right?
5540960	5546560	The chat room is, the chat room is demanding it on Justin TV when it comes out.
5546560	5548400	So we'll see.
5548400	5550280	We'll see.
5550280	5554000	Moving on.
5554000	5558720	We'll see how the Xbox 360 sells after the price drop and moving on into Christmas.
5558720	5561280	I think they're going to continue to sell pretty well.
5561280	5564760	The question is, will they overtake Nintendo or will Sony answer them?
5564760	5565760	That's another one.
5565760	5569720	A lot of people seem doubtful, but who knows?
5569720	5573120	Another game that a lot of folks have been playing on their Xbox 360s as well as their
5573120	5576000	PlayStation 3 is Burnout Paradise.
5576000	5580760	And a long awaited motorcycle download is coming on September 18th.
5580760	5582760	It's actually a new patch, basically.
5582760	5587880	It's a free download update, 38 new clock race events.
5587880	5595520	Dynamic weather events, a day-night cycle, meaning the game goes up from day to night,
5595520	5600600	70 new challenges in the Freeburns thing, and motorcycles.
5600600	5601600	So that's pretty cool.
5601600	5602760	But when are they adding the airplanes?
5602760	5605200	That's what I want to know, because they're talking about adding airplanes.
5605200	5606200	I'm glad to be...
5606200	5607200	Who's got giant enemy crabs?
5607200	5608200	Yes.
5608200	5613040	I want to be able to drive a giant enemy crab.
5613040	5616380	This is one of those games that I played for three days and I never played again.
5616380	5619360	And I keep thinking I need to go back and play it again.
5619360	5622520	This is giving me the incentive to do so, so I'm definitely going to have to check it
5622520	5623520	out.
5623520	5624520	Sounds pretty cool.
5624520	5626720	Have you been playing any Burnout Paradise, Loki, or has this kind of put it away?
5626720	5631320	No, I just noticed the other day that I still have my copy of Burnout Paradise sitting on
5631320	5633820	a shelf.
5633820	5635920	It just came out at a bad time, from what I remember.
5635920	5637960	I need to go back and look at it again.
5637960	5642280	It was better than the last one, but I don't know.
5642280	5646600	It's just, when the next big game came out, I forgot about it.
5646600	5652440	And sadly enough, you know, with Rock Band 2 and stuff, when Saints Row 2 comes out,
5652440	5655160	I'm going to forget about Rock Band 2.
5655160	5656160	Never.
5656160	5657400	I'll never forget about Rock Band 2.
5657400	5659960	Hey, they're doing a pretty good job trying to extend the life of it with the challenges
5659960	5660960	and everything.
5660960	5663000	But anyway, let's move on.
5663000	5664000	Moving on.
5664000	5665000	Yes, please.
5665000	5670760	Well, you know one of my favorite ever companies is Capcom, right?
5670760	5671760	Yep.
5671760	5672760	Yeah.
5672760	5673760	They were nice to me.
5673760	5675280	I don't know why they were mean to you.
5675280	5676680	Do we have to go back there again?
5676680	5679680	Because don't get me started, do not go there.
5679680	5685800	Well, Capcom is planning on doing all of their major titles on multiple platforms to maximize
5685800	5691400	their impact in the United States, especially, just outside of Japan.
5691400	5696880	And it's actually quoted as saying basically where the consuls are practically waging war
5696880	5701000	on one another in their annual report.
5701000	5705400	It said, completing implementation of multi-platform development on major titles means that all
5705400	5711040	major titles launched during the next fiscal year or thereafter will be developed as multi-platform
5711040	5712040	games.
5712040	5719400	So, that's why we should be, you know, that's why Devil May Cry 4, for example.
5719400	5721400	Or Mega Man 9.
5721400	5722400	Mega Man 9, exactly.
5722400	5726600	A lot of us assumed it was going to be WiiWare only and then suddenly it's showing up everywhere.
5726600	5735520	The MT framework is actually supposed to be for PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 development.
5735520	5740280	Resident Evil 5, Street Fighter IV are among the list.
5740280	5746200	And so they're also thinking about including a few more casual games like for Wii and other
5746200	5747880	more casual game systems.
5747880	5752040	You know it would be interesting if they released Mega Man 9 on PC as well.
5752040	5753440	Why not, huh?
5753440	5757840	You know there was an old, old, old Mega Man game on the PC that I owned, and it wasn't
5757840	5759440	related to any of the other Mega Mans.
5759440	5762800	I remember it only had three boss monsters, which I thought was kind of cheesy.
5762800	5765040	Are you talking about Man of the Power Battles?
5765040	5771240	No, it was an actual, it was a side scroller like in the vein of the Nintendo games, but
5771240	5773480	with better graphics at the time because it was on PC.
5773480	5775960	I don't know, maybe somebody in the chat room knows more about this and can remember.
5775960	5780380	I actually bought this game like way back when in the early 90s, and it had like three
5780380	5782160	boss monsters, so it was short.
5782160	5785400	But I remember like one of them was electricity based, as you remember.
5785400	5789600	It wasn't, it wasn't based on, they were new Mega Man monsters.
5789600	5792440	It was like a completely different Mega Man game.
5792440	5793440	I'm not crazy.
5793440	5801760	Well, in other news, they also are, they stated also again in their annual report Capcom did
5801760	5807360	that there are more Western focused titles in development, one of them named Dark Void,
5807360	5809760	if you know, we remember that.
5809760	5816320	And they plan to aggressively acquire partners and other studios, especially independent
5816320	5820580	developers, the ones that will share their vision.
5820580	5830520	So I think that that's sounding to me very, like a potential good thing.
5830520	5832720	I found the information on Wikipedia.
5832720	5833720	Did you now?
5833720	5834720	Yes.
5834720	5835720	It was by High Tech Expressions.
5835720	5837520	It was released in 1990.
5837520	5839440	It was just licensed by Capcom.
5839440	5843980	There were three robot masters, Volt Man, Sonic Man, and Dynaman, and there were only
5843980	5846920	two levels in the Wily Fortress, so it was a short game.
5846920	5848360	Yeah, I'd say.
5848360	5851240	And there were other versions on PC, I guess, too.
5851240	5852240	I never knew about those.
5852240	5853240	I just had the first one.
5853240	5857040	I don't think the PC versions were very good.
5857040	5859720	They were cool when I was a kid, but I don't think they're cool now.
5859720	5860720	What?
5860720	5861720	Thanks to you.
5861720	5862720	Huh?
5862720	5866480	The Air Man Can't Be Defeated song.
5866480	5867920	Whose fault is that?
5867920	5868920	Yours.
5868920	5869920	No.
5869920	5877400	Well, some things that are good come in threes, I guess, including a bundle that's being released
5877400	5881560	by Microsoft coming out later this holiday.
5881560	5889260	It's a brand new 12 month live gold kit, and it's gonna come with Project Gotham Racing
5889260	5898320	4, a 12 plus one month card of live, and the Xbox 360 messenger kit, and it's gonna run
5898320	5900480	you $69.99.
5900480	5905840	This was rumored to be coming out from the GameStop expo, although it's on their website
5905840	5910920	now, and I personally know it's coming out, so it is coming out.
5910920	5912980	It's kind of a good deal.
5912980	5916320	There was some other bundle that they were talking about coming out as well that I haven't
5916320	5919640	heard anything on, but I know this one for sure is coming out, so.
5919640	5920640	Alright.
5920640	5922120	It's pretty cool.
5922120	5924960	Very cool, and especially when they're trying to move more consoles and units.
5924960	5928160	If I remember correctly, I think this is coming out in a few weeks, too, so.
5928160	5929160	Nice.
5929160	5930160	Yeah.
5930160	5933960	Well, there is some drama going on in the Microsoft world, and it has to do with a firing
5933960	5935360	that happened this week.
5935360	5939120	Apparently what happened, there was this guy who actually went on the record.
5939120	5944800	He went on this website, VentureBeat, and actually talked openly about the red rings
5944800	5945800	of death.
5945800	5947160	The guy's name was Robert Delaware.
5947160	5951480	He was a Microsoft game tester, but he was through a temp agency called Excel Data.
5951480	5954520	He was let go by the company on Wednesday.
5954520	5956440	They are now threatening to sue.
5956440	5959880	They're threatening civil charges to this guy, because apparently what he did, he went
5959880	5965000	on to VentureBeat and talked about, openly, with his name and everything, and the website
5965000	5968720	kind of told him what the consequences might be of him using his real name, and he was
5968720	5970280	like, so what?
5970280	5973820	Apparently he went on and talked about these two different red ring to death scenarios.
5973820	5978760	A reproducible crash that could happen in NBA 2K6 was one game that you could reproduce
5978760	5984800	the crash in, and apparently some dashboard update bugs in Dead Rising.
5984800	5987740	Apparently he's being very standoffish about it.
5987740	5992240	He doesn't care that the former employer of his wants to sue him and says, if they want
5992240	5995720	to come after me, bring it on.
5995720	5996720	Very interesting.
5996720	6001200	But, you know, he did probably violate the terms of employment that he had with Microsoft
6001200	6002920	and all these companies that he was working through.
6002920	6007520	I mean, you do kind of don't talk about the products like this, especially on a website.
6007520	6009700	It's a little...
6009700	6015760	I hope he knows what he's talking about, because he's gonna have to prove, well, yeah, I guess
6015760	6018480	he's gonna have to prove that he's telling the truth, so.
6018480	6021840	D'Artesuja says, wow, the cajones on this guy, yeah, for real.
6021840	6025040	Rama says, did he sign an NDA that forbade him from saying this?
6025040	6026040	I'm sure he must have.
6026040	6028200	If he didn't sign the NDA.
6028200	6031720	Unless it was specific, or, I don't know.
6031720	6035760	Maybe, but even still, though, I mean, they can get him on that, but at the same time,
6035760	6040640	I mean, he's hoping to open like a whole other can of worms with, you know, Microsoft knew
6040640	6042960	about these defects and they didn't do anything about it.
6042960	6043960	Ah, I see.
6043960	6044960	So he's trying to be a hero, basically.
6044960	6045960	Yeah.
6045960	6047960	Well, we know what happens to heroes.
6047960	6048960	Yes.
6048960	6049960	They become martyrs.
6049960	6055600	Well, let's hope it doesn't get that bad, but, well, there you go.
6055600	6059080	We'll keep you updated if we hear anything else in the adventures of this guy and his
6059080	6060280	soon-to-be legal troubles.
6060280	6064400	Well, something that might not be soon to happen, I mean, they're talking about it,
6064400	6072080	but I'm still thinking that it'll be out when another title with its name comes out, is
6072080	6076120	there are supposed to be a Duke Nukem movie.
6076120	6077360	Yeah.
6077360	6082560	Scott Fay, the one who's doing Max Payne, was saying that he's working on a movie scenario
6082560	6092500	that he thinks will do the character in the series justice, but I'm honestly really expecting
6092500	6100960	to see it more along the lines of when Duke Nukem Forever comes out, maybe, but he also
6100960	6109320	says that Depth Entertainment will be doing with trying to work on a few other cross media
6109320	6118160	franchises going into games and film, and they actually are still at work at doing American
6118160	6123840	McGee's Alice, and Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't doing that anymore, by the way.
6123840	6125400	Oh, really?
6125400	6126640	Yeah.
6126640	6131440	You know she changed her last name officially for her husband?
6131440	6134000	That's one of those Hollywood relationships that has actually stayed together, so good
6134000	6135000	for them.
6135000	6138320	As a anniversary present, I thought that was really sweet.
6138320	6139320	Mm-hmm.
6139320	6143280	Well, if you want to hear something even more ridiculous, there was a rumor coming around
6143280	6150000	about a Craigslist entry that said that they were casting for a Rock Band 2 TV show.
6150000	6156240	Well, apparently it is true, and it's going to be officially launched next week, Rock
6156240	6164800	Band 2 The Show, and they also have some other stuff they're going to be showing as well.
6164800	6168340	I know they did something last night during the launch party.
6168340	6174000	They had Alice Cooper and Sebastian Bach facing off and stuff, but apparently there is some
6174000	6179440	sort of Rock Band show that's going to happen on MTV.
6179440	6182440	And what exactly will be on the Rock Band show?
6182440	6183440	It's basically...
6183440	6185000	Just watching people play Rock Band?
6185000	6189720	Basically you're going to follow, I guess they're going to set up some band teams or
6189720	6190720	whatever.
6190720	6192560	It's a 30-minute commercial for the game is what it is.
6192560	6193560	Basically, yeah.
6193560	6197680	Well, when you're MTV and you put out the game, you can kind of do that, so...
6197680	6198760	Besides, you know what?
6198760	6202680	I don't see this being much worse than some of the other programming on that station,
6202680	6203680	so bring it on.
6203680	6204920	True, I guess it'll be better than The Hills.
6204920	6205920	So there you go.
6205920	6209480	Well, you know, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear about one of my favorite music
6209480	6214840	games jumping the shark and becoming a half-hour commercial TV series and reminding us why
6214840	6220320	MTV is a little bit poison for this series, or a lot of it poison, I get very angsty.
6220320	6223840	I don't know about you guys, but it makes me just want to get out the angst in a segment
6223840	6241360	we call the FUs of the Week.
6241360	6246400	My FU goes to bullshit in the mouths it spews from.
6246400	6247400	Loki.
6247400	6251880	My FU goes to EA for saying that the Rock Band 2 drums are supposed to be out today
6251880	6258360	and not actually shipping the Rock Band 2 drums to anybody, so it's a big clusterfuck.
6258360	6260060	Thank you.
6260060	6267040	My FU goes to whatever little animal decided to crawl under our house and die because it
6267040	6270960	happened on, I guess, Friday when we started noticing that, hmm, something smells like
6270960	6272360	death.
6272360	6275740	So now the animal control people aren't going to be able to even come out until Monday because
6275740	6280360	we think it's a cat, because there was a cat that was sometimes in our backyard that just
6280360	6284440	looked like hell, and it's not around anymore.
6284440	6290420	So you know, although I am sad for little kitty, FU to deciding to die under our house
6290420	6293040	and not in, say, the neighbor's pool.
6293040	6297520	Come on.
6297520	6299520	It's just gross.
6299520	6300520	All right.
6300520	6303120	That's it for the FUs of the Week.
6303120	6307160	But boy, we get into some FUs of the century when we talk about some of the gaming industry's
6307160	6309660	biggest controversies they've ever had.
6309660	6312440	This is on a website called MCVUK.com.
6312440	6315320	They ran a top 10 list this week of gaming's biggest controversies.
6315320	6319640	Hey, if you want to get your website on Dig, just add a top 10 list.
6319640	6320640	Seriously.
6320640	6322840	That's all you ever see on Dig are these top 10 lists from these sites I'd never heard
6322840	6325520	of until I see the top 10 list.
6325520	6327360	So there you go.
6327360	6330640	Anyhow, here's a quick rundown of what the controversies are.
6330640	6333640	Number one on the list, the Night Trap.
6333640	6337560	Remember Night Trap when that was out on Sega CD, and it actually had video?
6337560	6338560	With Dana Plato.
6338560	6339560	Exactly.
6339560	6343080	Dana Plato was fucked up.
6343080	6346880	And it was just girls running around basically in their undies, getting eaten by monsters.
6346880	6347880	It was pretty violent.
6347880	6353280	It was real, because it was like real video and all that stuff.
6353280	6358240	Gaming's biggest controversies, number two, Mortal Kombat, because it kind of, if you
6358240	6360520	think about it, started the ESRB.
6360520	6364160	Remember when you'd see all those fatalities on the nightly news and everything about,
6364160	6367720	oh my god, so much blood, rivers of gore, rivers of gore.
6367720	6370280	You know, and then they're just, it's on the nightly news.
6370280	6371960	It started the ESRB, essentially.
6371960	6374560	So it was highly controversial.
6374560	6377400	Carmageddon is number three on the list.
6377400	6378400	Carmageddon.
6378400	6382400	Well, Carmageddon, you know, and it was a little bit more in Britain, because, you know,
6382400	6387200	remember it went over to the BBFC, trying to get a certain rating, and then they actually
6387200	6392520	banned the game and forced this company to remove all the gore from the film, or from
6392520	6397520	the game, and so they substituted green blood instead of red blood, very similar to what
6397520	6400160	happened with the sweat in Mortal Kombat here.
6400160	6402000	They got green blood zombies.
6402000	6408600	Well, you know, in Samurai Shodown, for the US one, they put in, well, I think it was
6408600	6411560	the US one, they had sweat instead of blood, like in the Japanese one.
6411560	6413280	Yeah, a little silly.
6413280	6415120	And in the German one, they had robots.
6415120	6418680	Not even people, but robots that you ran over.
6418680	6423660	America's Army is number four, and it has to do with, you know, the game was developed
6423660	6426560	and is being used as a recruitment tool.
6426560	6431120	But Ubisoft kind of has gotten itself in a little bit of trouble for publishing the console
6431120	6433200	version of the title.
6433200	6436400	Apparently there was like a demonstration outside of their offices after this whole
6436400	6445200	thing, because they actually went and published a console version, and that was really bad.
6445200	6450500	It's basically a giant recruitment tool, which in a way is controversial in itself.
6450500	6455120	Number five was something called Murder by PlayStation.
6455120	6460800	Apparently it was some type of like story that was actually released, it was a headline
6460800	6465120	that was actually in a paper on the Daily Mail, and it was actually a story about a
6465120	6470800	14-year-old kid who was murdered by a 17-year-old kid, and the newspaper claimed that the kid
6470800	6477080	was obsessed with Manhunt, and by the way, police did say there was absolutely no link
6477080	6479240	between the game and the killing.
6479240	6485040	But yet that headline, Murder by PlayStation, giant bold letters, still exists.
6485040	6489360	Number six on the list, the guy game, remember the guy game, Loki?
6489360	6491400	We covered the guy game on this program.
6491400	6496480	Guy game was awesome, except for the 17-year-old that got in it, that caused the game to get
6496480	6498120	pulled from shells everywhere.
6498120	6504440	Dude, seriously, I mean, yeah, because tits on a 17-year-old really change a lot in a
6504440	6505440	year.
6505440	6506440	Seriously.
6506440	6507440	It's gay.
6507440	6511760	Well, I don't, actually no, it wouldn't be gay, unless you're a woman.
6511760	6514880	No, because that game screws another of the same gender.
6514880	6518600	It was just, I mean, obviously it's a big no-no, and very irresponsible.
6518600	6522040	It's her fault anyway, she lied about her age.
6522040	6523040	It's just irresponsible.
6523040	6524040	Dumb bitch.
6524040	6527400	But the game, the game itself- They could be having guy game four by now.
6527400	6531640	Yeah, if you cut this little element out of the game, we'd be on like guy game, you know,
6531640	6533920	on Xbox Live Arcade, it would be awesome.
6533920	6535920	Hell yeah.
6535920	6540520	Number seven, hot coffee, all I need to say.
6540520	6543360	If you don't know enough about that by now, where have you been?
6543360	6546400	Number eight was when the BBFC tackled Band Hunt 2.
6546400	6549960	Of course, there was all the controversy around that, and then that got banned, and then it
6549960	6554020	wasn't, and then the game sucked anyway, remember?
6554020	6558880	Number nine was Goat Gate, which is another way to refer to, remember the Greek god launch
6558880	6561400	party for God of War 2 over in Europe?
6561400	6564160	And they actually slaughtered a live goat.
6564160	6565800	Remember that?
6565800	6571160	I don't think that- Marketing genius over there.
6571160	6575000	Dot, dot, dot, that's all I have to say.
6575000	6576000	Dot, dot, dot.
6576000	6580520	And then the other last controversy on the list, because I know you're all loving this.
6580520	6582560	Sony versus God.
6582560	6588400	And it has to do with the fact that the Church of England was actually used- Manchester Cathedral,
6588400	6592200	its church was actually used in Resistance, Fall of Man, and they were not happy about
6592200	6593200	that.
6593200	6594200	Remember that?
6594200	6596240	We covered that on the show a little while ago.
6596240	6597240	So there you have it.
6597240	6601840	The top 10 biggest controversies according to MCV UK, so it is a little more UK based,
6601840	6605200	hence why we had a couple of those in there, but I would say UK or not, those are pretty
6605200	6607680	good entries on the list.
6607680	6609240	Very controversial.
6609240	6611000	Anything you think they left off?
6611000	6616960	I think, remember the PSP ad that had like the, it was almost racist because it had like
6616960	6619960	the white and the black, and it was, oh man, it was bad.
6619960	6620960	Remember that?
6620960	6623720	That was somehow left off the list.
6623720	6626320	Just another brilliant Sony marketing scheme from the day.
6626320	6627320	Anything else you guys can think of?
6627320	6628320	I don't know.
6628320	6629320	I think they hit most of the good ones.
6629320	6634640	But, alright, we'll see in chat, chat.orangelawnsradio.com if anybody thinks of anything.
6634640	6636360	No Custer's Revenge either.
6636360	6640200	There's usually a Custer's Revenge that shows up on the list like that.
6640200	6644420	Alright, let's see what you guys have to say in our mailbag.
6644420	6649560	Every week you guys email us, mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com, and we read your emails here live on the
6649560	6650560	show.
6650560	6659400	We'll send you the old mailbag and see what emails we've got.
6659400	6664720	First email comes from Cheeseburger and it says, sorry I got you mad last week.
6664720	6666600	Can you please tell me more about Gatchaman, please?
6666600	6667600	Did I spell that right?
6667600	6668600	Yes, she did spell it right.
6668600	6670600	Gatchaman is awesome!
6670600	6676440	1972 anime character designs done by Amano.
6676440	6680520	Just go look it up on Wikipedia and then go watch all of it.
6680520	6682360	That's the only way you'll appease me.
6682360	6683360	Nice.
6683360	6685000	Hey, OLR crew.
6685000	6687680	This is the next email, by the way.
6687680	6691560	After listening to last week's show, I figured right into clarifying what the Rob D was saying
6691560	6694600	about me shaking while at the mic.
6694600	6699160	It wasn't while at the mic that my hands started to shake, but after, it was a bit of a rush
6699160	6703680	being on the air with a bunch of internet celebrities who are too humble to admit they
6703680	6706000	really are celebrities, however minor.
6706000	6707720	I am not.
6707720	6712520	I am actually egotistical enough to admit my celebritydom on the internet.
6712520	6714560	Curse you, adrenaline!
6714560	6720200	Anyway, it was great meeting you all at PAX and was very glad that I made it to Wild Ginger
6720200	6724520	that night in one piece as the food and conversation were awesome.
6724520	6727000	Who knew mango could make pork taste like beef?
6727000	6729840	This is talking about the Chinese restaurant, all the games people went to, yeah?
6729840	6732440	As I ordered the mango pork and it was freaking fantastic.
6732440	6736360	Yeah, the food I had was good too.
6736360	6740600	Plus I had to be the best Dan Padtai I've ever had, it made being lost in the scuzzy
6740600	6742780	part of Seattle at night totally worth it.
6742780	6746360	That was a really good Padtai, I agree with that because I had some too.
6746360	6751560	I didn't just write to reminisce and sing praises though.
6751560	6755080	A few episodes back you guys were talking about Dragon's Lair and Space Ace and they
6755080	6759880	should be put on PS3, well good news, not only are they playable on PS3, but any Blu-ray
6759880	6760880	player.
6760880	6765520	I've actually had them in stock where I work for quite some time now and I'm kind of shocked
6765520	6771240	they aren't on shelves with the games at other stores as well, he put links on Amazon.
6771240	6775600	Actually I think, the reason I didn't get them is because I've already got the HD versions
6775600	6781140	for PC so, but I hope I passed the Grammar Nazi test here.
6781140	6787120	You almost did, but for right is WRITE.R-I-G-H-T.
6787120	6789400	I can't wait until next year's PAX assuming I can go.
6789400	6791400	Cheers to Cypher.
6791400	6792400	Yay.
6792400	6793400	PS.
6793400	6798360	This email was brought to you by the OLR Mailbag, home of the never-ending Olive Garden references.
6798360	6802240	I wish I haven't had an Olive Garden reference in a little while, but there you go.
6802240	6803240	Thank you.
6803240	6804240	Rob, let's go to Olive Garden.
6804240	6805240	Dude, I really want Olive Garden.
6805240	6806240	We have to.
6806240	6810020	You know where I went this week was Corrino's, good stuff.
6810020	6811020	I've never been there.
6811020	6812020	Nom nom nom.
6812020	6816360	I'd take you to Pasquale's, but I don't think they have anything light though.
6816360	6820280	Or we should go to a little, they have a little joint here in Sacramento called Espanol, which
6820280	6822560	is the Italian place with a Spanish name.
6822560	6823560	It's really good.
6823560	6824560	Okay.
6824560	6825560	I have a very yummy minestrone soup.
6825560	6826560	Mmm.
6826560	6827560	Orange launch foodie-o.
6827560	6828560	Next email.
6828560	6829560	Hey, OLR.
6829560	6830560	Hi.
6830560	6833520	I just have to say, I love that on this show when we're not talking about video games,
6833520	6834520	we're talking about food.
6834520	6835520	It's great.
6835520	6836920	I have gushy foods.
6836920	6840880	Ooh, Rob D says never-ending pasta is going on at Olive Garden right now.
6840880	6842560	Dude, we are there, okay?
6842560	6845000	Never-ending pasta doesn't mean no good anyway.
6845000	6846000	Hey, my email.
6846000	6847000	Sorry.
6847000	6848000	Email.
6848000	6849000	Hey, OLR.
6849000	6852480	I read this on the FAQs of EA's new Sports World site, which is their online community
6852480	6854160	for their sports games.
6854160	6857480	One of the questions is why there's no female avatar option.
6857480	6862480	Their response was, quote, question, why is there no female avatar image?
6862480	6866480	In effort to align EA's Sports World with our primary user base, the decision was made
6866480	6868560	to use a male avatar image for its launch.
6868560	6871800	However, a female avatar image is planned for future releases soon.
6871800	6875320	Is it just me or are they making an assumption about who plays their games?
6875320	6880880	I'm not a female, but I think that it is kind of sexist to gear a sports game towards males
6880880	6886160	only and assume that all the women are playing Barbie Island Princess or baked cakes, although
6886160	6889240	cakes are great.
6889240	6894320	Maybe I am completely stupid and don't see why this is okay, but maybe, no, but I'm sure
6894320	6898400	many women across the world play sports games and other types of traditionally male games
6898400	6900880	like GTA, other FPSs, et cetera.
6900880	6905120	Well, thanks for reading this, and remember, if you are in the all games chat room, DMN
6905120	6906340	can't kick you.
6906340	6909120	The cake is live, PK Junior 92, Yaris sucks.
6909120	6917440	Well, you have to understand that until EA Sports releases, you know, Dinner Making 09,
6917440	6923920	you know, they're not going to have female avatars, unfortunately.
6923920	6928040	The Rob D says in chat, translation, their response was, girls don't play games.
6928040	6929480	Is this true, Dark Sakura?
6929480	6931920	Do girls not play games?
6931920	6934000	I beg to differ.
6934000	6935000	I had a feeling.
6935000	6936000	I remember.
6936000	6938920	I bet we have some more listeners out there that beg to differ as well.
6938920	6940480	You remember, though, Rob.
6940480	6941480	What?
6941480	6944520	Remember me telling you that there was a football game I actually liked.
6944520	6945520	Tecmo Bowl.
6945520	6946800	No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl.
6946800	6952680	It was, um, great, now I can't remember, but it had a cool name.
6952680	6956840	It was that one football game that was, um, on Super Nintendo.
6956840	6958560	Must have had a lasting impression.
6958560	6962260	Well, no, I can never remember the name of it, too, was the problem with it.
6962260	6963440	Was it with the four player thing?
6963440	6964720	Was it Super Tecmo Bowl?
6964720	6967280	No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl anything.
6967280	6968280	High Impact or something?
6968280	6969280	High Impact.
6969280	6970280	Thank you.
6970280	6971280	It was Super High Impact.
6971280	6972280	I just had a feeling.
6972280	6974520	And I said that before I saw Dark Sakura say it and shit.
6974520	6980520	I was gonna say, also, that, um, yeah, girls don't play games and EA doesn't release games
6980520	6982960	that aren't buggy.
6982960	6985140	That just means that girls play good games.
6985140	6987240	You know how I feel about sports games, you guys.
6987240	6992160	Look, I respect those of you guys that choose to play them, but for me, Tecmo Bowl or GTFO?
6992160	6997540	No, it was all about that hockey game on Saturn.
6997540	6998540	Or Blades of Steel.
6998540	6999540	Blades of Steel.
6999540	7000540	Thank you.
7000540	7001540	Thank you.
7001540	7002540	Anyhow, go ahead.
7002540	7005640	Hockey is fantastic, too, because, you know, blood bounces on ice.
7005640	7008400	You know, NHL 09 came out this last week.
7008400	7009400	We should check it out.
7009400	7011560	I used to watch hockey regularly.
7011560	7012600	Let's get into sports games.
7012600	7014680	I wouldn't buy NHL 09.
7014680	7016240	I want a rugby game.
7016240	7017240	There's stories about it.
7017240	7019160	I want someone to send me a rugby game, okay?
7019160	7023820	Apparently it's got some sort of memory leak in the cache file on your hard drive and will
7023820	7025680	stop working after a while.
7025680	7026680	Oh, shit.
7026680	7029720	Imagine if we came on the show one week, and during How Was Your Gaming week, suddenly
7029720	7032320	it's like Jamie's talking about, yeah, I played NHL 09 this week.
7032320	7034160	I'm like, yeah, I played Madden.
7034160	7039080	Logie's like, I played Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
7039080	7040680	And then we'd, never mind.
7040680	7047440	No, it would be like, I was gonna say, then we'd be AGI, but you know.
7047440	7049080	If you wanted to, sick burn.
7049080	7054800	If you wanted to do the complete role reversal here, I would be playing Imagine Babies, and
7054800	7059960	Rob would be playing Yaris, and Matt would be playing the Tingle Game.
7059960	7060960	Nice.
7060960	7063360	The Tingle Game, seriously.
7063360	7064600	For April Fool's Day next year.
7064600	7065600	All right, we'll have a nice email.
7065600	7066600	Nice email.
7066600	7067600	Hey guys, Dan Shadow here.
7067600	7071280	I've been meaning to email you guys for quite some time, but I've been very busy lately.
7071280	7072280	Welcome to the club.
7072280	7076900	If this email seems long, it's because with every new episode, there's a new subject to
7076900	7078120	talk about.
7078120	7079480	This segment goes to Rob.
7079480	7080480	Hi, Rob.
7080480	7081480	Hi, me.
7081480	7082480	Who's this from?
7082480	7083480	Dan Shadow.
7083480	7084480	Hi, Dan Shadow.
7084480	7088520	A while back, you mentioned going out to Long Beach and visiting the Queen Mary.
7088520	7091480	I laughed when you mentioned that, because I currently live in Long Beach.
7091480	7093520	Next year, I will be getting married on the Queen Mary.
7093520	7095440	It's a big boat.
7095440	7096440	My wedding will be booze-themed.
7096440	7097440	Chew on that.
7097440	7098440	Aww.
7098440	7099440	I miss booze.
7099440	7102840	I also wanted to point out that I am your Brazilian listener.
7102840	7106760	I haven't been there in 10 years, because, well, it's just better to live here.
7106760	7111200	However, I will return next summer to have my new wife meet my family there.
7111200	7112720	Brazilian listener.
7112720	7113720	Awesome.
7113720	7118200	I've been craving Brazilian grill.
7118200	7119800	You don't even know how long.
7119800	7120800	You know what I'm talking about.
7120800	7122360	Like the Espritu's Place in San Francisco.
7122360	7123600	I've never been there, Rob.
7123600	7127800	Oh, they have a thing like it in Sacramento now called Taste of Brazil or something like
7127800	7128800	that.
7128800	7132400	And basically, that's where they bring the big slabs of meat on the swords and just slice
7132400	7133400	off a slab of meat.
7133400	7134400	Do we have to order in Portuguese?
7134400	7135760	No, I don't believe you do.
7135760	7136760	You don't order at all.
7136760	7137760	You just pay.
7137760	7138760	You have a little dial.
7138760	7139760	It's a buffet.
7139760	7140760	Green means go.
7140760	7141760	Red means stop.
7141760	7142760	Sweet.
7142760	7145520	I don't want to be there when I'm eating meat again.
7145520	7147360	Thinking about playing Warhammer online?
7147360	7148360	Do it.
7148360	7151840	I've been in the closed and open beta, and I can tell you right now it's worth it.
7151840	7152840	Here's an example.
7152840	7157040	Let's say you're a squig hunter, and you want to drop aggro.
7157040	7158160	You don't feign death.
7158160	7162480	Instead, you will piss yourself, and the enemy won't touch you after that.
7162480	7163480	Nice.
7163480	7168520	Yeah, the orcs and goblins are on the comedic side, but if you want to be serious cool,
7168520	7170080	then play as the high elves.
7170080	7173720	I will be in the head start, so if you decide to get it, let me know, and we can play on
7173720	7174720	the same server.
7174720	7176440	No, and the head server.
7176440	7177440	Sorry.
7177440	7178440	No.
7178440	7181640	It says, I will be in the head start, so if you decide to play, blah, blah.
7181640	7183680	On another note, I can't wait for LittleBigPlanet.
7183680	7186200	That seems like a game that can't possibly get old.
7186200	7188700	Oh, and Rotband 2 equals party night.
7188700	7191440	This email is brought to you by Strong Bad.
7191440	7195120	Keeping my Wii alive with his never-ending style.
7195120	7196840	Very nice.
7196840	7199920	You know, again, my only reservation about Warhammer.
7199920	7204000	It's not that I don't think it'll be a decent game that'll fill my time, but I really worry
7204000	7208440	about picking up another MMO, because when I play an MMO, all my other games suffer.
7208440	7214800	I mean, go back and listen to my gaming weeks on certain episodes of
7214800	7215800	I played Final Fantasy XI.
7215800	7216800	I played Final Fantasy XI.
7216800	7217800	Again.
7217800	7218800	I played Warcraft.
7218800	7219800	Again.
7219800	7224540	Now is especially not the time of year to get sucked into a new MMO, but I am thinking
7224540	7225540	about it.
7225540	7226540	Star Trek Online.
7226540	7227540	Star Trek Online.
7227540	7234360	And then, I have to admit, I read about the new Final Fantasy XI patch, it actually sounds
7234360	7235360	pretty awesome.
7235360	7236360	No!
7236360	7237360	Don't do it, Rob!
7237360	7238360	Don't do it!
7238360	7240160	They're fixing it so that you can level easier, finally.
7240160	7244480	If you can level by yourself, then it's better.
7244480	7248400	You can level, like, let's say you're level 12 and your friend is level 70.
7248400	7253800	Your level 70 friend can cap himself to 12 and level with you, and you guys both still
7253800	7256040	get experience.
7256040	7257880	So you can level at any level.
7257880	7259360	Kinda neat.
7259360	7261960	I will say level 1 forever!
7261960	7262960	Seriously.
7262960	7268240	I will not be playing this bullshit.
7268240	7270240	Final Fantasy bullshit?
7270240	7274120	Unless it's Penn and Teller's Final Fantasy bullshit, then I'll play that.
7274120	7276040	I somehow don't see that happening.
7276040	7278640	That should be a bullshit game, that'd be cool.
7278640	7282520	I do see myself going out and at least checking out Warhammer for a month or two before I
7282520	7284480	see myself going back to fixy.
7284480	7287200	Alright, next email.
7287200	7288200	Star Trek Online!
7288200	7289440	Yeah, and then there's that.
7289440	7290440	Star Trek Online!
7290440	7292480	I'm hoping that gets delayed to 2010.
7292480	7293480	Star Trek Online!
7293480	7294480	Alright, shut up.
7294480	7295480	Read the next email.
7295480	7296480	Shut up and read.
7296480	7297480	Jeez, Rob!
7297480	7299800	Yeah, we'll bite my big bloody left toe.
7299800	7301800	Sorry, that's my right toe.
7301800	7307400	Hey guys, I've been listening to your podcast for about the last year.
7307400	7310560	Even though I can't listen to it live because I have school.
7310560	7313600	You guys are my favorite podcast and I never miss your show.
7313600	7315600	I haven't been able to get a 360 yet.
7315600	7318440	It sucks because my mom and dad won't let me get one.
7318440	7322040	They think that I shouldn't get another system even though I want to trade in my PS2.
7322040	7328680	Anyway, since I have nothing to do and want to save money, I've been playing free MMOs.
7328680	7330440	Here are a couple and what they are.
7330440	7331800	S4 League!
7331800	7336720	This game is a third person shooter that has anime style graphics and these make it so
7336720	7338660	you can do flips and other cool stuff like that.
7338660	7341000	And that's at s4league.com.
7341000	7342760	MapleStory!
7342760	7346280	You probably heard of this one, but if you haven't, it's a platforming MMO that's kind
7346280	7348760	of like Super Mario Brothers, but you use weapons.
7348760	7349760	That's at Nexon.com.
7349760	7353080	Again, these are all free and really fun.
7353080	7354880	Thanks guys, keep up the great work.
7354880	7358520	This email is brought to you by my Wii, PS2, GameCube, and any other system that I don't
7358520	7359520	want anymore.
7359520	7362840	Home to the never-ending dust that collects on them because they're outdated and my parents
7362840	7363840	don't let me trade them in.
7363840	7364840	Wow.
7364840	7365840	Alrighty.
7365840	7374480	I also do have to commend you on your fairly decent sentence structure and grammar.
7374480	7376040	Gold star for this listener.
7376040	7378040	You get a smiley face.
7378040	7380640	By the way, Rob D., I was snickering during that email because I read this comment in
7380640	7385640	chat from Rob D. talking about Penn and Teller's Final Fantasy XI bullshit.
7385640	7389680	He says, wait, so you want Final Fantasy Desert Bus?
7389680	7392640	Dude, you know what?
7392640	7395960	Sometimes running from one end of the map to the other when you're not a high enough
7395960	7398720	level to have a chocobo feels like playing Desert Bus.
7398720	7401480	I'm not even fucking with you.
7401480	7402480	You know what?
7402480	7406840	My whole thing was when I did play the game and was too low to actually make it across
7406840	7411040	the desert without dying, I skirted the wall.
7411040	7413400	I was doing maze business.
7413400	7414400	That's what you have to do.
7414400	7415560	Skirt the wall and you hide.
7415560	7418080	Like, oh my god, it's going to kill me.
7418080	7419360	Okay, last one.
7419360	7420360	Ready?
7420360	7421360	Okay.
7421360	7422360	Dun, dun, dun.
7422360	7426440	This is Rob Rod, who originated that joke.
7426440	7428440	So we have to give him props.
7428440	7429440	Props.
7429440	7430440	Hi, OLR.
7430440	7435160	Well, I've been waiting all year for TNA Impact to come out and now it's finally released.
7435160	7437320	I see nothing but terrible reviews for it.
7437320	7442080	Bad grapple system, only five slots for created wrestlers, only a handful of moves, and so
7442080	7443080	on.
7443080	7446160	I really hope the other games I'm looking forward to this year, Dead Space and Silent
7446160	7447920	Hill Homecoming, don't suck.
7447920	7450660	How can a Silent Hill game suck, okay?
7450660	7454960	So I'd like to ask, what was the biggest disappointment that you guys ever had to face with games
7454960	7457000	you were highly anticipating?
7457000	7462080	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.
7462080	7466240	You know, I have to say, one of the first ones that jumps into my mind was Nintendogs.
7466240	7470520	I hate to say it, it's not that Nintendogs is a bad game, but I just got so hyped for
7470520	7474260	it at E3 that the bar got set so high that the game just couldn't live up to it.
7474260	7475960	It really couldn't.
7475960	7478960	I tried.
7478960	7482640	I remember one time Dan and I, this is when Dan and I were playing a lot of wrestling
7482640	7491720	games, and we rented, at the time, WWF, or was it, which one was the one that had Nitro
7491720	7492720	for the wrestling?
7492720	7493720	Hell if I know.
7493720	7499780	At the time, they were still, they were still the WCW and the WWF.
7499780	7502440	I've like played two wrestling games, okay?
7502440	7503440	WrestleMania 2000 was great.
7503440	7507280	I played WrestleMania on the NES, when you could play as like Hulk Hogan and Andre the
7507280	7513320	Giant and Macho Man Savage, okay, I played that old school one, and then I played Rumble
7513320	7514320	Roses.
7514320	7520120	Rumble Roses was great, but at any rate, Dan and I decided that we were going to rent the,
7520120	7524040	no it was Thunder, that was it, I think it was WCW Thunder.
7524040	7532300	We rented it, got it home, played it for ten minutes, and called the Hollywood or Blockbuster
7532300	7538040	that we got it from, and took it back, and they let us take out another game.
7538040	7539040	It was that bad.
7539040	7544840	I just remember that that has been the one, even Spice World didn't disappoint me that
7544840	7545840	badly.
7545840	7547920	At least you knew what you were going to get with Spice World.
7547920	7550400	Yeah, sheiss.
7550400	7554620	I got a night of endless laughs with Spice World, just, you know, we were, I guess we
7554620	7556800	were drunk, but it was really funny.
7556800	7559760	There is one game that disappointed me, but it was a Japanese release only, it was Super
7559760	7560760	Producers.
7560760	7568600	Super Producers was a game where you manage a pop idol's career, and it just disappointed
7568600	7574920	me because it was a lot more language-intense than I was prepared for.
7574920	7587940	Gears of War, Halo 3, Bullet Witch, and, oh there's one more, I know it, it's pretty ballsy
7587940	7589640	putting Gears of War on that list.
7589640	7592400	I didn't like it at all, I thought it was going to be really cool.
7592400	7595200	Halo 3 I was just disappointed, it was just average.
7595200	7596200	Halo 2.5.
7596200	7597200	Yeah, pretty much.
7597200	7605600	I don't know, I'm trying to think if there's anything else, Yars, I don't know.
7605600	7611180	Rob D in chat says Mega Man X5 disappointed me a lot.
7611180	7614960	More recently, that Infinite Undiscovery, although I'm hearing if you can get past the
7614960	7619440	first couple hours that suck, it gets a lot better, so I'm trying to force myself to
7619440	7620440	play it more.
7620440	7628240	But now I have Rock Band, I just want to play Rock Band all day.
7628240	7630200	And no other emails then, huh?
7630200	7634060	Mailbag at Orangelaunchrated.com if you have some mail you would like to contribute for
7634060	7635060	next week's show.
7635060	7639520	In the meantime, a little more gaming news, and then the Skype line.
7639520	7643320	There's a couple hacking and cracking stories we have.
7643320	7650280	The first one is a modification someone made using the Xbox 360 messenger kit, and they
7650280	7654600	turned it into a keyboard for the PSP, which is kind of cool.
7654600	7661840	It uses just a little data port that you would connect your headphones to, and supposedly
7661840	7667600	right now he's writing some drivers for homebrew stuff, so that's pretty cool.
7667600	7671300	And then the second one is less of a hack, more of a mod.
7671300	7675000	Someone has modded an NES into a toaster.
7675000	7676140	And why?
7676140	7677140	Because it's funny.
7677140	7680580	Wait, wait, wait, they made a Nintendo out of a toaster, or they turned a Nintendo into
7680580	7681580	a toaster?
7681580	7686720	They put a toaster, they have a toaster, and they put a Nintendo inside of it.
7686720	7693080	And it actually has apparently some LED lights in the case that light up.
7693080	7697460	I'm not sure if it lights up red like it's cooking, because that'd be pretty funny.
7697460	7704740	But yeah, NES toaster.
7704740	7707560	Does it pop up and go ding when something's done?
7707560	7708560	No.
7708560	7710560	Then what's the point?
7710560	7711560	It's a toaster.
7711560	7714620	Oh, well okay.
7714620	7715620	It's a Nintoster.
7715620	7717560	Nintoster, huh?
7717560	7720840	How would you like to get paid money to play World of Warcraft?
7720840	7724460	No this is not some spam email, it's actually a tie into the upcoming story here.
7724460	7732440	The National Science Foundation gave $100,000 to do a study for World of Warcraft.
7732440	7736840	It's to an informatics professor at UC Irvine, Bonnie Nardi.
7736840	7741320	What she's going to be researching is player gaming habits and culture, not only in the
7741320	7743740	US but in China as well.
7743740	7747880	Apparently she's already been out in the field actually looking at World of Warcraft players
7747880	7753260	across internet cafes around Beijing, apparently talking about the differences in play styles,
7753260	7756400	some of the similarities in the culture, kind of interesting.
7756400	7761200	Here's a quote from the study, or from the lady involved with the study.
7761200	7764880	The Chinese have invented some interesting ways to play with the in-game economy, not
7764880	7766400	the real world economy.
7766400	7769800	Ways that I have not observed here in two years of studying World of Warcraft.
7769800	7772480	Chinese players are more attuned to the aesthetics of the game.
7772480	7774260	At least they mentioned them in more interviews.
7774260	7778800	They talked more about color schemes, animations, architecture, and so on more than American
7778800	7779800	players.
7779800	7784000	So she goes on to say that the Chinese players, they actually don't really play with the add-ons
7784000	7785080	and modifications.
7785080	7789360	They like the challenge of the core game, whereas in America we like to mod our game
7789360	7790800	to hell.
7790800	7791800	Kind of interesting.
7791800	7794960	She's getting paid $100,000 to finish this research.
7794960	7799080	She's doing it along with a student going after their doctoral, and will be doing some
7799080	7802000	type of final paper that I'm sure will be published all over the internet when it's
7802000	7803000	done.
7803000	7807140	$100,000 to study WoW.
7807140	7808760	You can really get a job doing anything.
7808760	7810600	No, I guess that's neat.
7810600	7812280	It's just kind of like, wow, there's a lot.
7812280	7815880	I guess, but then you think about the complex layers, I guess there is a lot to study, but
7815880	7819760	I'm just kind of curious what will be contributed to society from the results?
7819760	7823800	Is it a way for us to better understand each other through games?
7823800	7825520	Why don't people just actually socially interact?
7825520	7828200	Oh, that's right, because people are scary.
7828200	7829200	Yeah.
7829200	7831440	People are scary.
7831440	7834260	Well how about some more news?
7834260	7835260	How about it?
7835260	7836520	Would that make you giddy, Rob?
7836520	7837520	Yes.
7837520	7852360	Speaking, because we did have an email earlier regarding, excuse me, no, sorry, my, I stopped
7852360	7853360	working.
7853360	7857400	Yeah, it was Warhammer, sorry.
7857400	7863540	There was an announcement put out that there are actually server types and server names
7863540	7866120	for Warhammer Online, Age of Reckoning.
7866120	7873360	There's Core Open RVR, which is Realm versus Realm, Roleplay, and Roleplay slash Open RVR.
7873360	7875620	So that's pretty cool.
7875620	7883360	It's going to have the standard gameplay, but you've got unrestricted PVP combat on
7883360	7891880	the core server, and then on Realm versus Realm, you have to be flagged for combat to
7891880	7895320	do PVP stuff.
7895320	7900560	You can also, though, permanently flag people, though, on the Open Realm versus Realm servers.
7900560	7905280	And of course, Roleplay servers are basically getting into your character, Roleplaying.
7905280	7906280	We know this.
7906280	7909760	Which hopefully they actually enforce, unlike in WoW.
7909760	7913040	I mean, I guess you can file tickets in WoW, but it seems like you always get a bunch of
7913040	7917460	a-holes on there, and they're like, haha, RP, and it's like, dude, you signed up for
7917460	7918460	an RP server.
7918460	7919460	What the F were you expecting?
7919460	7920460	I know, right?
7920460	7924240	I've done a Roleplay server before for World of Warcraft.
7924240	7925240	I had a lot of fun.
7925240	7926800	I played a real bitch.
7926800	7929440	Like that's, you know, any different.
7929440	7930880	That's not Roleplaying, Jamie.
7930880	7931880	That's real life.
7931880	7933880	You see this ferret?
7933880	7936440	I do.
7936440	7937440	Bend over, Rob.
7937440	7938440	No.
7938440	7939440	No, no ferrets.
7939440	7948440	But anyway, those are the type of servers that are out, so that's pretty cool.
7948440	7951520	And I don't know which one I'm playing on yet, if I get the game.
7951520	7952520	If.
7952520	7953520	If.
7953520	7954520	Sorry.
7954520	7963320	I was, I was fascinated by the fact that apparently they changed the name of Africa in, uh, Japan
7963320	7966080	to, uh, Akuna Matata.
7966080	7967080	I'm serious.
7967080	7969120	That's the actual title now.
7969120	7970120	Akuna Matata.
7970120	7971120	Akuna Matata.
7971120	7972120	Seriously.
7972120	7973120	It's Africa.
7973120	7974120	Disney will sue.
7974120	7975120	I guess.
7975120	7979560	No, it's, well, they didn't make it up, but that's interesting.
7979560	7981120	I thought the game already came out in Japan.
7981120	7983120	How did they change the name now?
7983120	7987120	Okay, well, to be honest, this is the Asian reason, one, so I don't know.
7987120	7991080	I would think that the names are the same, but I could be wrong.
7991080	7996880	No, it's Africa and Japan, but apparently for Asia, it's Akuna Matata.
7996880	7998120	I'm seriously thinking about buying this, though.
7998120	8000840	That is the fucking raddest name for a game ever, though, you gotta admit.
8000840	8001840	It's only $54.90.
8001840	8002840	Really?
8002840	8003840	With three dollars?
8003840	8005280	But it's coming out here eventually, right?
8005280	8007640	Eventually, but, I don't know.
8007640	8009280	I like things I can get early.
8009280	8010280	Whatever.
8010280	8011760	Anyways, back on topic here.
8011760	8013640	Bioshock.
8013640	8019960	It's a PS3 game now, at least it will be in October, and as with most PS3 games, it will
8019960	8022760	require an install, but don't worry.
8022760	8029440	That'll be an entertaining 10 minutes as you watch Rapture-related advertisements and music.
8029440	8036720	Awesome, and the install size, a whopping 4.98 gigabytes.
8036720	8039480	Sucks if you have a 20 gig PS3.
8039480	8042760	That kind of sucks.
8042760	8047560	Oh, and the graphics are about the same as the Xbox 360.
8047560	8067480	I wonder if this game is changing, which- is it too much to get the freaking chorus?
8067480	8076280	Ugh, I just wanted the freaking chorus, but the little samples on iTunes have the little
8076280	8079080	chorus pre-versus there.
8079080	8080080	Lame.
8080080	8090400	Hakuna Matata, da da da da da da, Hakuna Matata- hey, Harry Potter!
8090400	8092800	Hakuna Matata, Harry Potter!
8092800	8093800	It's almost the same thing, right?
8093800	8095360	What do they have to do with each other, Rob?
8095360	8100480	Well, you know that the Harry Potter movie got pushed back to the disgust of 14-year-old
8100480	8104400	girls everywhere, and some girls that think- no, I'm just kidding, obviously there's a
8104400	8110180	ton of people that are really into Harry Potter, disgustingly so almost, and instead they're
8110180	8114640	getting Twilight out in the movie theaters this Christmas, but Harry Potter got pushed
8114640	8115640	back to next summer.
8115640	8119760	Well, this should be kind of a duh, but the game got pushed back as well.
8119760	8123240	That's right, EA confirmed this week that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the
8123240	8128720	game has been delayed, and even though I would think the game is pretty much done, but maybe
8128720	8131160	they'll take some time to go back and tweak it.
8131160	8135280	What's kind of sad about this, though, is that EA now is not going to get the profits
8135280	8137900	from this game until their next fiscal quarter.
8137900	8140240	That's a loss.
8140240	8141820	Oops.
8141820	8146760	So Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will be out in video game form when the movie
8146760	8150920	comes out, summer 2009, and I'm sure a lot of you kids can't wait.
8150920	8153280	Are we getting a Twilight video game?
8153280	8154280	No.
8154280	8156280	That's what I want to know.
8156280	8157280	No?
8157280	8158280	Where's that tie-in?
8158280	8160560	It's, uh, I don't know.
8160560	8165080	I want my sparkling vampires in a video game, come on.
8165080	8167720	Vampires that sparkle?
8167720	8168720	That's too cool.
8168720	8175880	Hey, our Skype line's open at Orange Launch Radio, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8175880	8180520	Real quickly, though, some last minute stories, Loki, I know you had something about EA and
8180520	8181680	Take-Two, right?
8181680	8182680	Yes.
8182680	8183680	The final nail in the coffin.
8183680	8184920	Breaking news!
8184920	8188160	EA gives up on Take-Two acquisition.
8188160	8190160	It's official.
8190160	8192520	They will not buy them out.
8192520	8196600	And apparently EA has released this.
8196600	8201640	Electronic Arts today announced that while EA continues to have high regard for Take-Two's
8201640	8206800	creative teams and products, after careful consideration, including a management presentation
8206800	8213640	and review of other due diligence materials provided by Take-Two, EA has decided not to
8213640	8218240	make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions with Take-Two.
8218240	8223320	Really, could it be all those times that they said, no, no, no, stop bothering me, no, no,
8223320	8225480	no, no, no, no, no?
8225480	8229000	Maybe it just took them going, la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
8229000	8230000	thing.
8230000	8234240	I can't see you, I can't hear you, la la la la la la la la.
8234240	8239040	Skypline's open 1-877-GAMO-LR, your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, we're gonna
8239040	8241640	take some calls.
8241640	8242640	We'll start here.
8242640	8243640	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8243640	8244640	My name is Aku.
8244640	8245640	Hey, it's Aku.
8245640	8248640	What's on your mind, my friend?
8248640	8253840	Not much, just chilling on a boring Sunday night, except for you guys, we're just making
8253840	8254840	it all better.
8254840	8255840	Thank you.
8255840	8256840	Oh, yeah.
8256840	8258760	Hey, you're getting DDRX this week?
8258760	8259760	You're a DITR fan?
8259760	8265720	Well, I'm on a wait and see right now, and since I'm unemployed and I need work right
8265720	8273080	now, I need to hold off on spending, you know, splurging money on, like, luxury such as video
8273080	8274080	games.
8274080	8275080	Well, that's definitely understandable.
8275080	8279280	Yeah, you know the location just happened, you know, last week, right?
8279280	8283000	Actually, throughout the better part of last week, it just ended today.
8283000	8286000	Oh, yeah, how'd that go?
8286000	8292360	Dude, uh, from what I've known, from what those folks were able to test out there, it's
8292360	8294200	shaping up to be a pretty good mix.
8294200	8296160	Now, I have a real quick question.
8296160	8299800	DDRX, isn't that supposed to be coming out soon in the arcades, or are they...
8299800	8300800	Yeah.
8300800	8303600	I mean, they tested the arcade, and they were testing it last week.
8303600	8304600	Yeah, exactly.
8304600	8305600	Okay, Rob, you remember that...
8305600	8306600	What?
8306600	8309800	Um, you went into that store, Gamer's Empire, with me, remember, by the Folsom Theater?
8309800	8311200	I didn't go into it, but I...
8311200	8312200	You know of it, yeah.
8312200	8313200	I know of it, yeah.
8313200	8318240	I've been in the front of their, um, store into an arcade now, and they have told me
8318240	8320720	that they are probably gonna get DDRX.
8320720	8321720	Well...
8321720	8323120	That'd be fucking awesome.
8323120	8327140	Well, it depends on whether or not they just buy the full cab, or the upgrade kit.
8327140	8329640	It's gonna be the full freaking cabinet.
8329640	8331320	They said it's really expensive.
8331320	8336580	Remember, that cab that was used in the location test is not final, it's kind of like a prototype
8336580	8337580	right now.
8337580	8342160	It's a work, you know, it's basically a test pad for what, you know, what Konami is trying
8342160	8346400	to do, according to what the rep said over there.
8346400	8350560	And they're ditching Betsy, which is great news, since now Konami is restarting their
8350560	8351560	arcade division.
8351560	8353920	Oh, I didn't know they were restarting it.
8353920	8354920	That's pretty cool.
8354920	8359220	Yeah, because that's, that's what the, you know, the folks, the guys who were running
8359220	8363880	the test, you know, the folks in the arcade, you know, Konami's arcade division, that's
8363880	8366080	what they were telling the folks who were at the test.
8366080	8367080	Nice.
8367080	8368420	They said we're starting over.
8368420	8369420	We are starting over.
8369420	8372620	Yes, indeed, yes, and that's how they mean it.
8372620	8375680	Does this mean we might get Silent Hill Arcade Game over here finally?
8375680	8383160	Well, it means that no, you know, unfortunately we won't have that American incompetence holding
8383160	8388240	back certain, you know, basically taining the good name of DDR with shitty cabs and
8388240	8389560	just piss poor service.
8389560	8394000	It means that Konami is actually, if they want, they're actually doing something right,
8394000	8397240	they're actually doing it themselves this time.
8397240	8401440	Well, any other thoughts, Zaku, on your mind before we get to another call?
8401440	8407840	Um, just the fact that secure ROM and EA is just, just killing PC gaming.
8407840	8414000	Ah, yes, the whole DRM, I'm sure you can't run away from this discussion somewhere on
8414000	8415000	the internet.
8415000	8417920	We were just talking about it with Bobby on his show a little bit, when we were doing
8417920	8423640	the little toss over that he does at the end of his show, you know, it's, it's unfortunate
8423640	8426460	that the people who are actually selling out the money to get the games are the ones that
8426460	8427460	are getting punished.
8427460	8430720	See, I was going to buy Command & Conquer, you know, I was going to buy Red Alert 3 until
8430720	8437720	I found out that it was basically boiled down to something almost, almost akin to a rental.
8437720	8442560	And that's something I'm not cool with because I don't want to be, you know, first and foremost
8442560	8446560	I, there's no way I'm going to be treated as a criminal first.
8446560	8448800	And then have to prove my, you know, my innocence.
8448800	8454160	It's not the, you know, it's innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.
8454160	8458080	It does, it does make me wish that the game would come out on consoles, you know, because
8458080	8460600	it's sad because it's sad for PC gamers.
8460600	8464920	I would want it, I would want to use my keyboard and mouse instead of the controller.
8464920	8468360	You can use, technically you can use the keyboard on 360, it's just there's really only one
8468360	8469360	game that it sustains.
8469360	8472080	Well the game, well the game support those two peripherals, that's what I want to know.
8472080	8473080	I wish it would.
8473080	8477760	If not, then I might as well just, you know, just skip it until they, they ditch the, the
8477760	8481240	protections on the PC version, which is the one I wanted to buy in the first place.
8481240	8482240	All right.
8482240	8486560	It just, it just sucks, you know, it had to be like that, but hopefully we'll, you know,
8486560	8488920	we'll hit EA where it hurts, in their wallets.
8488920	8489920	Well, we'll see what happens.
8489920	8493200	All right, Zacko, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one, okay?
8493200	8494200	All right, you too.
8494200	8495200	Take care.
8495200	8496200	By the way, thank you.
8496200	8500720	Somebody in chat reminded me that I completely forgot to do the OLR pre-show Twit, because
8500720	8504120	I did it for a story that came up a little later in the show, but we were talking about
8504120	8508120	Warhammer just a little bit ago, and the server's coming up, and that the game is actually launching
8508120	8509120	this week.
8509120	8514240	So we actually asked this week on our pre-OLR Twit, which is available at our Twitter, our
8514240	8517960	username is OLR, we actually asked people, are you going to buy Warhammer online?
8517960	8521440	Are you currently a Warcraft player that's considering leaving for Warhammer?
8521440	8523480	Here's some of the responses we got via Twitter.
8523480	8528760	GS68 says, I don't play MMOs, except the real occasional Albatross 18.
8528760	8531200	And I apologize if I mispronounce your names, guys.
8531200	8534040	Dustoise says, I'm actually waiting for champions online.
8534040	8538160	I love City of Heroes villains and would love an updated, better version of that.
8538160	8541760	Tiara says, nope, still waiting patiently for Star Trek Online.
8541760	8546520	Pika Uno says, simply, hell no.
8546520	8548840	Dartitsuya says, I'm just waiting for Diablo 3.
8548840	8553480	DJ Tyrant says, no and no, I've seen the war beta, and it looks very similar to WoW, and
8553480	8555320	I'm not a huge PvP player.
8555320	8557440	If I were, I might leave.
8557440	8563320	Geovdea, sorry if I mispronounced that name, says, I'm waiting for Guild Wars 2.
8563320	8568140	MistyOLR says, yeah, I'm with GS68, who said I don't play MMOs, 100% on this one.
8568140	8570640	My damn attention span doesn't help things either.
8570640	8572860	Quel Tipo says, will there be bards?
8572860	8575640	If so, yes, give me a damn bard already, people.
8575640	8580120	I hate to say it, but Fefixi has bards, and it's actually a pretty awesome class to play.
8580120	8584120	ActDeaf says, considering that I was never into MMOs, Warhammer, even though it looks
8584120	8585840	good, I won't be picking it up.
8585840	8588520	MMOs are never-ending repeat cycles.
8588520	8590960	MeowFrog says, I'm not buying Warhammer.
8590960	8591960	I may later on.
8591960	8593640	However, I do still play WoW.
8593640	8596080	I have friends who have canceled their account for Warhammer.
8596080	8598120	I actually know people that have done the same thing.
8598120	8602200	We used to do a big raiding alliance to do the 25-mans, and a bunch of them have quit
8602200	8603200	to go to Warhammer.
8603200	8604200	It's something else.
8604200	8609880	Lastly, here's another one I'll probably mispronounce, SpongeTwang says, not buying Warhammer online.
8609880	8614880	Currently playing WoW sparingly as is, using spare and spare time for DDR.
8614880	8619460	So I'd like to point out, out of those 12 responses, not a single person said they're
8619460	8620460	buying Warhammer.
8620460	8621460	Uh-oh.
8621460	8625600	But we did have people saying that their friends are getting it, so maybe it's not going to
8625600	8627840	be a huge game.
8627840	8631920	And certainly we have a very unscientific sample, but there you go.
8631920	8632920	And thank you, it's GeovayDay.
8632920	8638920	I just have to say it with a little accent there, GeovayDay, sorry for mispronouncing
8638920	8639920	your name horribly.
8639920	8640920	Okay, more calls, yes?
8640920	8641920	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8641920	8642920	Who's this?
8642920	8643920	Hey, it's ParadoxVincent, what's up guys?
8643920	8644920	Hey, ParadoxVincent, how are you?
8644920	8653600	Don't forget to turn your radio down in the background, we were hearing ourselves a little
8653600	8654600	bit there.
8654600	8655600	What's on your mind, buddy?
8655600	8661640	Um, well, not much, I just wanted to give a big shoutout to you guys for playing, uh,
8661640	8665720	I'm Having Trouble Beating Airman from Mario Paint, I really like that.
8665720	8670000	That was all Jamie, she picks the background music you're going to hear when she does the
8670000	8676480	Classic Game of the Week, so a nice little reference there to other great gaming things.
8676480	8680060	Yeah, I'm pretty much obsessed with that song.
8680060	8683780	What is it about that song that has you obsessed?
8683780	8689920	I don't know, I just, well, I found it on YouTube a really long time ago, and I just
8689920	8695360	kept listening to it and kept listening to it, and it's just a nice little Japanese rock
8695360	8702000	song from some Japanese indie band, and it's about Mega Man and I can't go wrong with that.
8702000	8706240	It sounds like you could go on a Mega Man game though, right?
8706240	8712000	Maybe Mega Man 10, they should have a best of, Mega Man All Stars, as the best monsters
8712000	8713000	from all the games.
8713000	8715480	Do you like watching the videos that they make for these?
8715480	8722080	I don't know if you heard that, do you like watching the videos that they make for these?
8722080	8728920	Oh, yeah, yeah, that's my favorite part, that's one of my favorite parts of those little videos,
8728920	8733840	I don't exactly know if they just hand animated them or if they're all pixeled, but yeah,
8733840	8736200	that's one of my favorite parts about it.
8736200	8739320	Alright, well, very cool.
8739320	8741200	Anything else you've been playing lately?
8741200	8747840	Yeah, actually, well, I mean, I haven't really been playing it, but, well I guess I have,
8747840	8753800	a few weeks ago I went over to a party and I really started playing on my friend's PS3,
8753800	8761840	and I used to really bash the PS3, but you know, lately, and he sat me down, and, can
8761840	8764560	I do a really quick plug here?
8764560	8767160	Sure.
8767160	8775520	It's my friend's website, his name is Frank Castle, and he runs this community called
8775520	8777840	Arizona Hobbyist Paradise, what?
8777840	8781880	He's not the Punisher, is he?
8781880	8782880	Yeah.
8782880	8787160	Frank Castle is the Punisher's name, sorry.
8787160	8788160	Nice.
8788160	8790680	Alright, so he runs a comic thing in Arizona?
8790680	8801160	Yeah, well it's called Arizona Hobbyist Paradise, and it's at hobbyistparadise.com, and it's
8801160	8807480	just for like AZ Arizona people who like gaming, anime, and comics, but I was playing on his
8807480	8813640	PS3, and then he sat me down, and then he's like, you know, the PS3 is starting to really
8813640	8817760	gain a lot of ground in the gaming industry, and I obviously disagreed with him, but then
8817760	8823760	he showed me this big list, and I mean, I'm looking at the PS3 exclusives right now, and
8823760	8828800	it used to kind of be like the big joke of gaming, but I'm really thinking about picking
8828800	8831200	up a PS3 really soon.
8831200	8835360	I do want one for LittleBigPlanet and Home, definitely has me curious, but I think Sony
8835360	8839320	still has a long way to go, and that's kind of been a theme with them lately, and that's
8839320	8842680	kind of worrisome, you know, they were allowed to do a little bit of a slow launch with the
8842680	8847720	PlayStation 2, because, you know, it was really the only thing out there, if I remember, I
8847720	8851840	don't know when it first came out, but with the PSP, you know, there wasn't a lot of must-have
8851840	8855680	games on the PSP, and a lot of those patches that enabled the internet and all those things
8855680	8858240	came out a long time after the release.
8858240	8861920	Remember, the PSP didn't do a whole lot when it was first released, I mean, yeah, it played
8861920	8865320	music, but the memory on it was so little.
8865320	8873160	It's interesting to see that Sony's consoles have taken a long time to grow, just interesting.
8873160	8878840	I'm wondering, have you ever heard of the, I think it's, yeah, The Last Guy?
8878840	8880440	Um, no.
8880440	8884400	Yeah, it's The Last Guy, it's that one that was like that game in work time fun.
8884400	8885400	Oh!
8885400	8887440	The one where it uses like the Google Map-esque stuff.
8887440	8892800	Oh, okay, yeah, I think I remember hearing about this on a previous show, yeah.
8892800	8897560	And also, uh, Hane, Hane looked pretty, it looked interesting.
8897560	8902160	Eh, I hear it's a little silly, but okay, I mean, it's different.
8902160	8911280	I just think that, and Hane, if I'm not mistaken, isn't that a title that you buy on the PlayStation
8911280	8912280	Network?
8912280	8913280	Yes, it is.
8913280	8916160	That's one of those games I think that you can now get on your PSP as well through the
8916160	8917160	whole little...
8917160	8918160	No.
8918160	8919160	No?
8919160	8920160	It's not?
8920160	8921160	No.
8921160	8922160	I thought it was.
8922160	8923160	So, cause you know how some of those PlayStation Network games are coming on the PSP, like
8923160	8925160	Flow was one of them, I know?
8925160	8926160	Yeah.
8926160	8927160	That's interesting.
8927160	8928160	Yeah.
8928160	8929160	Echo Chrome.
8929160	8933360	Alright, well, anything else, Paradox Vincent, before we let you go?
8933360	8934640	Um, not all that much.
8934640	8937360	Alright, well, have a good one, buddy.
8937360	8938360	You too.
8938360	8940160	Next time I see you, I'll break your arms.
8940160	8941660	Oh, ow.
8941660	8942660	Why would you do that?
8942660	8943660	That's mean.
8943660	8945920	Zondief would do it.
8945920	8947840	Oh, okay.
8947840	8949640	Why would someone threaten to break my arms?
8949640	8953200	Now if my arms really do get broken, I have it on tape, and I can sue.
8953200	8959120	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8959120	8960120	All one word.
8960120	8962720	We've got time for maybe like one more call, I think.
8962720	8964720	We'll probably do tonight.
8964720	8965720	Alright.
8965720	8968760	Hey, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8968760	8971640	Hi, it's SSJ100Matt from New York.
8971640	8974640	Well hello SSJ100Matt from New York, how are you?
8974640	8975640	I'm good, thanks.
8975640	8980320	I was just thinking the other day, I miss New York City.
8980320	8981320	You should definitely come.
8981320	8984160	I want to come back and visit, I just don't know when I'm realistically going to make
8984160	8987300	it happen, cause I'm very likely taking two trips to LA.
8987300	8991200	There is a very small chance I might be able to pull through and do BlizzCon after all,
8991200	8994680	but more on that when I find out for sure, I don't want to jinx it.
8994680	8995680	So we'll see.
8995680	8998840	Well what's on your mind, buddy?
8998840	9004800	Well first off, I wanted to profess my love to Castle Crashers.
9004800	9008300	I think everyone who has a 360 needs to get it now.
9008300	9010800	What is it about Castle Crashers that you love?
9010800	9014920	I don't know, it just brings back my old love of the classic beat-em-ups like Turtles in
9014920	9015920	Time.
9015920	9017880	Turtles in Time is great.
9017880	9020120	It just reminds me of that.
9020120	9024760	I don't know though, the demo kind of got a little old for me, but I need to get the
9024760	9029520	full version I think, cause it does look like the little other aspects of upgrades and roleplay-esque
9029520	9031920	elements they put in there look kind of cool.
9031920	9034840	I didn't want to review the game based off a demo alone, especially when everybody else
9034840	9036880	is saying such wonderful things about it.
9036880	9039560	Also I've been playing the game by myself, and I imagine it's the type of game that's
9039560	9041400	much more fun with more people.
9041400	9043920	But I hear online it's broken.
9043920	9044920	Yeah online it's broken.
9044920	9048600	You know what, I haven't really been playing online, mostly my friends have been bugging
9048600	9049600	me to come play.
9049600	9055760	I'm actually getting texted right now asking to come over and play it.
9055760	9062960	But yeah, it's lots of fun, and it's kind of a good party game if you have a group of
9062960	9065600	people who are all about it.
9065600	9067800	Sure, sure.
9067800	9070960	And Rob D kind of sums up what I'm thinking, he's in the chat right now, he says, I'm enjoying
9070960	9074000	Castle Crashers, but I'm not really digging the combat gameplay.
9074000	9078000	I do like the art style and the music, but I'm not liking the characters or the attacking.
9078000	9083280	Yeah, I mean the game's got a certain quirkiness about it that's very cool, that piques my
9083280	9084280	interest.
9084280	9089680	But I don't know, the old school Ninja Turtles arcade game gameplay kind of got old a little
9089680	9090680	while ago.
9090680	9093880	Well I don't know, maybe it's not too completely fair to say.
9093880	9095480	When you waste all your quarters on it.
9095480	9099440	Yeah true, true, very true.
9099440	9104120	The other thing I want to talk about is, you guys kind of mentioned this before, is NHL
9104120	9105120	09.
9105120	9106120	Yes.
9106120	9111600	And I managed to pick that up yesterday, and you know what, I'm a big hockey fan, if anyone
9111600	9114560	who listens to Understudiation Live, I always call in about that.
9114560	9122940	But no, I think this is one of the better hockey games because of the whole online interaction
9122940	9124120	that they have.
9124120	9126360	What's so special about the online interaction real quick?
9126360	9135320	Well basically with it is, they kind of made hockey into an MMO, where you create a player
9135320	9141920	and you can take them onto a custom team where you know, you can have a bunch of friends
9141920	9147920	or like what we have with all games, we've decided to make an all games team.
9147920	9148920	Cool.
9148920	9156680	Does everybody play as one character on the team, or how does it work?
9156680	9160360	You play as one position on the team, or player.
9160360	9163720	So you can either play goalie, you can play center, you can play any position.
9163720	9170400	You can all play at once, and you know it's lots of fun, and so yeah we're trying to rally
9170400	9178200	every show to get some of their viewers on to make the all games team.
9178200	9184000	So I think we got about a decent number of 10 people, and I think we got Hendrix on there
9184000	9189640	from Super Happy Fun Time Show, I think he's the captain on there, and you know it's just
9189640	9190720	lots of fun.
9190720	9196080	We've already played a couple games I think, we're ranked number 5 in the 11th division.
9196080	9197080	Wow.
9197080	9201080	Well if any OLR people want to get in on that, I know we don't have a whole lot of sports
9201080	9206520	game nuts here, but you know I know there's some, where can they go for more information?
9206520	9213600	Well you can go on the OLR forums, I posted a topic about that, or you can go on the all
9213600	9219600	games forums under, you know, we're playing sports, some of that.
9219600	9222200	Alright NHL 09 online.
9222200	9223200	Very cool.
9223200	9225960	Alright well we got to let you go, we're going to start to wrap things up, but thanks so
9225960	9226960	much for your call, okay?
9226960	9227960	Yep.
9227960	9228960	Alright take care everybody.
9228960	9229960	Yep.
9229960	9230960	Bye.
9230960	9231960	Very cool.
9231960	9235720	Wow, I think we've talked more about sports games tonight than we have like in a year
9235720	9241280	on Orange Launch Radio, but that's okay, we want to give an equal opportunity to all games.
9241280	9244560	Let's see, we're going to wrap things up here, but I did get a private message I wanted to
9244560	9245560	read here.
9245560	9249440	James Patrick says, talk about Dragon Quest IV real quick, it's coming out on the 16th,
9249440	9251760	I'm trying to call but I probably won't get through.
9251760	9255760	Ah yes, another Dragon Quest, you know if it's as good as the Final Fantasy IV remake,
9255760	9256880	it'd probably be worth checking out.
9256880	9260720	I think a lot of people in this country played Final Fantasy, but not nearly as many played
9260720	9263680	Dragon Quest, so I'm sure a lot of people missed this the first time around.
9263680	9266400	I don't know, do you know anything additional about this title release, Loki?
9266400	9269800	Ah, that's Dragon Quest, I'm not a fan of Dragon Quest.
9269800	9270800	Really?
9270800	9271800	Why not?
9271800	9272800	You just don't like slobs?
9272800	9276120	I just never got into it, I tried playing Dragon Warrior like the first one a long time
9276120	9278840	ago and just never really got into it.
9278840	9282040	I beat the first one on Nintendo, I was hardcore.
9282040	9285600	Now granted I used the strategy guide to do it, but you know, I can admit it, I needed
9285600	9286600	a little help.
9286600	9287600	Rob cheated.
9287600	9288600	I did not cheat!
9288600	9289600	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
9289600	9291440	I had help.
9291440	9295520	It was officially sanctioned, it wasn't one of those things where for a while if you bought
9295520	9300120	the game you got the stupid thing free, the guidebook, which I always thought was a little
9300120	9303360	weird, but I'm pretty sure you did through Nintendo Power or something.
9303360	9305240	Um, what was I going to say?
9305240	9306240	It's been a long time.
9306240	9311520	Yeah, I don't know, I didn't even try Dragon Quest VIII, remember, well actually-
9311520	9312520	It was cool!
9312520	9314900	Dragon Quest VIII is actually really fun, I want to go back and beat it.
9314900	9317080	It was actually a lot, a lot of fun.
9317080	9321800	It was like an old school Super Nintendo Role Playing game, but with like 3D graphics.
9321800	9322800	Yeah.
9322800	9323800	I don't know.
9323800	9325960	It's not my thing, I guess.
9325960	9329680	I don't know, I still have to go back and finish Lost Odyssey, so, I mean, shit.
9329680	9334240	I am not buying any more RPGs until I finish Lost Odyssey.
9334240	9335240	So it may be a while.
9335240	9340400	Last- in all these like Square Enix, you know, offshoot games, you know, like Last
9340400	9344840	Remnant and Infinite Undiscovery, I don't know if I should even try those, cause I mean-
9344840	9349560	You know, I am being persuaded by a listener that Infinite Undiscovery may not be as bad
9349560	9353160	as the first two hours make it seem, but boy, what a crappy way to start the game is just
9353160	9354160	running from things.
9354160	9359140	I mean, it's just, ugh, kind of frustrating, but I'm gonna try to, try to suck it up and
9359140	9362120	try to get a little further, cause I like the part that I played at Penny Arcade Expo
9362120	9365680	and that bugged me, like, why isn't the game as cool as I remember, was I, was it just
9365680	9370600	that whole like, con, you know, like, you know how games always seem better at a con
9370600	9372620	cause you're caught up in the moment of a convention?
9372620	9379400	I don't know if this is, um, exactly a good comparison in its defense, but that's how
9379400	9383480	we started Final Fantasy VIII is running from things.
9383480	9387360	Mmm, I don't know though, Final Fantasy VIII kind of sucked too in its own way.
9387360	9389880	I liked Final Fantasy VIII, it was alright.
9389880	9393000	I did not, you know, I feel- junctioning single-handedly ruined, or drawing magic single-handedly
9393000	9395000	ruined Final Fantasy VIII for me, so.
9395000	9396000	Okay, maybe that.
9396000	9397000	Alright.
9397000	9400260	Anyhow, we're gonna wrap up the show, we gotta, uh, get on out of here, so, uh, we can't leave
9400260	9403040	though until we get, uh, more last minute stories, I don't know if there are any.
9403040	9404040	Yes.
9404040	9406040	Like I can get on the internet?
9406040	9407240	Oh, sorry.
9407240	9412080	In case you were wondering if Rock Revolution for the Wii is gonna be good, apparently it's
9412080	9413080	not.
9413080	9419040	Just, you know, throwing it out there, um, Kotaku actually got to preview the game at
9419040	9426520	a Nintendo party, uh, last Friday, and, um, apparently the game itself on the Wii, there
9426520	9431220	is no peripheral support whatsoever, even if you happen to do own, like, a drum set
9431220	9438120	for the Wii, you can't use it, and, um, you basically get three columns of, um, notes
9438120	9443060	that scroll down the screen, and you have to use either the C or D button, and strum
9443060	9446360	with- by moving the remote up and down.
9446360	9452380	Um, apparently it's tiring, and, um, also I guess there's maracas in there at some point
9452380	9453380	too.
9453380	9455940	And, uh, sucks, and it's not very accurate.
9455940	9463280	So, once again, Konami taking the cheap-ass route, I don't know, so that's kind of lame.
9463280	9469880	And, um, of course, kind of on the topic of Nintendo here, they will not be at E for All,
9469880	9475960	and, um, yeah, apparently they just didn't want to go, it's not in their plans, um, I
9475960	9481160	do remember, if I heard correctly, that they're gonna be showing off their games there anyways,
9481160	9485480	at like some Target booth or something, I guess they actually sell games at this expo,
9485480	9486960	which is weird.
9486960	9494600	And, um, Namco Bandai has said that they're planning on making more Xbox Live Arcade remakes
9494600	9500800	of classic, um, arcade games, uh, much like they've done with Pac-Man Championship Edition
9500800	9502800	and Galaga Legions.
9502800	9507440	No word on exactly what they're, uh, planning, but, you know, more games.
9507440	9513000	Um, one suggestion, I guess, says that the team is working on a Pole Position remake,
9513000	9517960	which is interesting, and this, uh, little bit, I thought I'd throw this out for you,
9517960	9524600	Rob, um, it's not exactly news, but there's a Dreamcast console available on playasia.com,
9524600	9526240	that's the Hello Kitty Special Edition.
9526240	9527240	Yay!
9527240	9530200	I've actually seen that in a store before, it's been out a while.
9530200	9531200	Yeah.
9531200	9533360	But they're hard to find, really, really hard to find.
9533360	9534360	Yeah.
9534360	9535360	So, that's it.
9535360	9536360	Alright.
9536360	9537360	Cool, cool.
9537360	9540320	Well, we're gonna go around and start to wrap up the show, we gotta get everybody's final
9540320	9543600	thought in order to do that, Dark S- ooh, excuse me, Dark Sakura.
9543600	9544600	Um, no.
9544600	9546920	Or, excuse me, Bob.
9546920	9547920	No.
9547920	9548920	No?
9548920	9549920	No final thought?
9549920	9550920	No, my final thought is no.
9550920	9551920	No.
9551920	9554280	Alright, uh, Loki, your final thought?
9554280	9559120	Um, I somehow dismissed the show role, but I was gonna mention it real quick, uh, Team
9559120	9564120	Icos were revealing a new game, The Queen, apparently.
9564120	9565120	The Queen of what?
9565120	9566120	England?
9566120	9567120	It's just called The Queen.
9567120	9568120	France?
9568120	9573000	It says, uh, Tokyo Game Show teaser website calls the game, Ico 3, The Queen.
9573000	9574640	Alright.
9574640	9577000	Which begs the question, what was Ico 2?
9577000	9578000	Mmm.
9578000	9581040	I don't remember an Ico 2.
9581040	9582040	Maybe Shadow of the Colossus?
9582040	9583040	I don't know.
9583040	9584040	He has some people say that.
9584040	9588840	But, uh, apparently it's gonna be Tokyo Game Show, so that's kind of exciting, um, and
9588840	9595320	also my final thought is that I got to the bottom of why those rock band drum sets weren't
9595320	9596320	out there.
9596320	9599840	Maybe they released a press release on the 10th, saying that they're coming later in
9599840	9600840	the week.
9600840	9606840	I somehow missed that, so that'd be why no one has them yet.
9606840	9612520	Um, my final thought for those of you in chat room discussing this game right now is it's
9612520	9615200	Treasure Hunter.
9615200	9616200	Not a thief.
9616200	9618680	Uh, alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's show.
9618680	9621520	We're gonna wrap up and, uh, get on out of here.
