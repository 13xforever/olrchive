14534	25702	September 21, 2008 Warcraft's expansion finally gets a release date, could Metal Slug get re-released in high definition, and Animal Crossing undergoes a strange name change overseas.
31960	33401	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
33462	35904	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35944	42931	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43011	48736	We always tape live on Sunday nights at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on allgames.com.
48917	50939	Although we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight.
51059	55263	The show before us, the Bobby Blackwell Show, ran over just a smidge, but that's kind of our fault.
56584	57145	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
79728	80588	No, I didn't.
80828	81328	What happened?
82589	87329	When it got a little bit cooler here, the wind picked up and blew all of the pollen around.
87649	92970	And, well, I'm very prone to sinus infections, and I'm trying to fight off one.
93910	94591	You know what you need?
95651	96451	A SARS mask.
96711	97391	You know what I need?
97551	97731	What?
98091	98871	Power thirst.
100632	101692	It's made from lightning.
102432	102792	Awesome.
104912	105292	All right.
105372	108073	So also say hello to the one and only Tech Master Loki.
108473	108573	Yes.
109614	111535	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
134223	139245	and LimeMutterPluckinB is the name of the guy that does it.
139525	140345	Unique.
141086	144547	They all flow together, each song, so that's why part of the song is on another track.
144627	146367	Gotcha, because I was like, why is that song cut off?
146407	146848	That's weird.
146908	149488	Okay, but it's one of those CDs that transitions from song to song.
149548	149889	I get it.
149909	150509	Alrighty.
151229	152490	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
152510	153071	I played Ragnarok
181417	182078	Ragnarok 2 Ragnarok 2
205936	206356	All right.
206396	208278	So, no, no, not three.
208398	217363	It was about, no, it was about a, no, it was about two years that I played the beta because I started on the first closed beta, I think.
218084	218704	Or before, no?
218864	219685	Yeah, the first closed beta.
220638	221318	So a long time.
221739	221959	Yeah.
222139	223040	So, wow, jeez.
223460	229664	I'm sorry if you haven't tried to get in on that beta, but I guess the whole, this is something about you have to have a Korean equivalent of a social security number to get in.
229744	233206	I also looked more into it, and the only thing that I'm really interested in it is the soundtrack.
233646	235007	It's by Yoko Kanno.
235608	236028	Oh, nice.
236988	243112	Yeah, I mean, as soon as I can find a reliable way to give it a go, I might try, but for right now, there's emulated ways.
243933	244593	All right, fair enough.
245914	248856	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, then Loki, how was your gaming week?
249460	250060	It was alright.
250381	252963	I played not a whole lot this week.
253183	255244	Mainly three things.
255304	256785	Grand Theft Auto 4, of course.
257426	262769	Trying to keep on my winning streak, but there was a day that I let it get away from me for a game or so.
263990	266592	But it's back now, so I'm still on my winning streak.
267353	269834	And then I played...
270815	272037	Some more of Mercenaries 2.
272698	275582	And I swear, the more I play that game, the more broken it gets.
276463	280548	But it's kind of entertaining just to see how bad the glitching will get.
281830	284794	And so I'm about a third of the way through it now.
286116	286717	And then...
288723	291604	I also played Pure, which is pretty fun.
291644	293425	It's an ATV off-road racing game.
293485	297726	Kind of a little similar to Excite Truck, sort of.
299687	302208	Controls aren't exactly as tight as Excite Truck.
302248	303789	I mean, it's a little bit more realistic.
304589	309151	But, you know, a lot of flying through the air and doing tricks and stuff like that.
309611	311451	And lots of nitrous, so it's fun.
313332	315773	But, yeah, that's pretty much it so far.
317145	318846	Alright, well, my gaming week.
319006	320587	I actually played something new this week.
320727	323628	I went out and got a copy of Warhammer Online.
323708	327110	I decided I was going to take the plunge and go ahead and start playing another MMO.
327550	329611	So I went and grabbed myself a copy of Warhammer Online.
330351	333913	And, I don't know, MMOs are really hard to evaluate.
334013	339355	You know, it takes a long time because there's so much depth to them that they can take a long time to evaluate.
339395	342597	So I'm not really sure what my full opinion of Warhammer Online is.
342637	344778	I'm still playing it, so that must be a good sign, right?
344798	346599	I had a friend of mine quit after playing it for...
347179	348300	Warhammer feels really clunky to me.
370214	370995	Really clunky.
371796	374058	There seems to be delay in some of the things I do.
374498	383326	You could blame my computer's performance, but seeing as I just got a new quad-core 6GB RAM computer, I don't think it's necessarily the computer's specs that are slowing it down.
383346	384568	It's just...
386489	388092	The interface feels a little clunky to me.
388132	395962	It's not so bad that the game really suffers because I still will play it and everything, but it's a little bit clunky to me.
396543	401750	And I don't know, sometimes I find the interface to be messy, but it's highly, highly customizable, which is cool.
401810	403452	And they really encourage people to customize this.
403492	403853	That's cool.
404453	406334	Some of the things I do like about the game now.
407255	412918	I do like the way the game seems to be split off into these three different areas.
412978	417461	You have your PvE stuff, which feels pretty much like Warcraft.
419402	424665	Go to guy with exclamation point overhead, or in this case, little book with green book.
425085	428087	Get quest, go do quest, turn in quest.
428607	430128	It's very, very similar to...
431869	432710	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
443058	453045	Like, for instance, one of the Realm vs. Realm things I got into was this thing where it's, for those that have played Warcraft, it's very similar to a Rothy Basin, but you only have two nodes.
453105	456027	And for those that are playing Warhammer, I'm describing them canes and brace.
456147	456848	I think that's how you say it.
458189	462752	But what's kind of cool about it, what I really liked is that, okay, so you have, you know, the order and you have chaos.
463192	465114	And you're trying to capture both the nodes.
465454	472619	And when one team captures both nodes, what's really cool is that it sets off this giant, like, alarm, like you hear a ROAR
472739	474120	Thanks for watching!
488151	488571	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
510106	511187	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
528925	529525	Warhammer Public Quests
549710	550351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
567248	568169	Beastmaster has a pair of ferrets
594167	595489	No, he does not have a pair of ferrets.
595529	597232	He's the Beastmaster over a dragon.
597472	599616	There might be a ferret Beastmaster later in the game.
599676	600056	I don't know.
600938	602120	Are they called Kodo and Podo?
602701	602801	No.
604619	605500	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
625912	628495	I feel like there's still a lot more of this game for me to explore.
629657	630838	And the MMO is early.
631338	640108	So while I might be criticizing the graphical interface and these sorts of things early on, there's going to be patches that will probably fix a lot of the stuff that bugs us.
640208	644392	I mean, let's face it, pretty much any MMO has a lot of issues when it first launches.
644693	647075	So that's another reason why I'm like, I can't really...
647916	652700	Review this game in full yet because it still has a long way to grow and develop.
653021	660087	But I will say this, if you're a PvPer, you really like the player versus player stuff, I think you're really going to enjoy Warhammer.
660507	664911	Even if you're more of a PvE type person, there's something worth checking out here for you.
664931	669636	Like, I'm usually not a big PvPer, but I thought it was set up enough where I didn't feel like...
670989	672891	I was wasting my time, if that makes sense.
673071	674693	I was having a good time and I was enjoying the game.
675033	676275	And that's really what it comes down to.
676575	680719	So I do recommend, if you like MMOs, check out Warhammer online.
680759	683081	At least do your research, check into it, see if it's something you like.
683462	693552	Sadly, there's no trial for it, really, and I think that's one thing they're severely lacking and they need to get up and running in the next 60 days, is get a trial for the people who really want to check out what this game's all about.
693752	694212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
714309	715510	I'm not at all interested in Warhammer.
716111	717913	But you're not really a big, big MMO player.
717933	721116	I mean, you play Ragnarok, but you haven't enjoyed a lot of the other MMOs you've played.
721476	722998	But Star Trek Online's coming out.
723218	723838	That's different.
723878	724599	That's a space one.
724759	730164	But actually, I liked World of Warcraft until it turned out that it just wasn't worth my time.
731366	731666	Loki?
732106	733928	I don't play MMOs right now.
734389	737952	And even when my wife joins Warcraft, I may not.
738456	738816	Do that.
738996	739857	Alright, fair enough.
740017	743220	Although when APB comes around, we'll talk again.
743800	745221	Alright, well that's it for my gaming week.
745261	748684	Otherwise, just pretty much Rock Band 2 and games you've heard me talk about before.
749164	752146	So, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
752306	755809	And tonight for housekeeping, Loki wants to talk about OLRPSP.com.
756089	759632	Well, I was just going to say that I have a thread up in our forum right now.
761233	764636	Basically, allowing you guys to submit...
765774	779786	Banners, because if you notice on the OLR PSP All Games Radio Player, that there's a little banner that keeps repeating, and you'll probably have noticed that there's only three of them, one including a banner for the PAX coverage, which is way old now.
781007	786031	So we need more banners, and it's real easy, pretty much you can make a banner for...
787249	794031	either one of the shows on the network, one of the inside jokes, something funny like one of the PSAs.
794251	794771	Just anything.
795211	798832	Just pretty much anything that's kind of show-related or network-related.
800553	801813	Or indie production-related.
802213	802413	Yeah.
803213	806354	And basically just 296 pixels by 32.
806414	809415	Why is it such a weird-ass banner size?
809835	811016	That's just the size I made it.
811136	811436	All right.
811696	811836	And...
813590	813990	There you go.
814230	816051	And all the details are on our forums.
817232	820633	And you can post your images there or email them to me.
821154	824815	And if they're decent, then we'll throw them up there.
825056	828657	And you can see the awesome, awesome OLRPSP.com.
828677	833039	You can see this in action on that great all-games radio tuner on the PSP.
833380	833560	Yeah.
833820	834080	Awesome.
835069	835809	Thank you for watching!
854338	855359	We're looking for more stuff.
855399	856420	We really need some stuff.
856500	860823	I don't think you're going to hear a lot in tonight's free break because I don't want to recycle the same old crap over and over again.
861223	863065	Sadly, I didn't have time to create anything new today.
863365	866127	So we really rely on you guys for some of the extra stuff.
866627	868389	Just send me an email or post on the forums.
868409	870090	There's all that cool stuff on there.
871631	874913	Now, Redertainment is in chat, reading some comments from chat.
874933	876955	He says, I have the latest version of the PSP hardware.
877295	880778	I tried to download the all-games player on olrpsp.com and it didn't work.
881218	882278	Any thoughts on what might be going on?
882479	882959	I have no idea.
884179	884679	It should work.
884819	887660	You just put it in this... It's probably the directory that you have it in.
887680	889321	You probably set it in the wrong directory.
892802	895964	Try downloading the official radio players off of Sony's website.
895984	898685	If those work for you, then I don't know.
898845	901886	But all you have to do is put them in the same directory as those and they'll work just fine.
901986	905507	But you test on the latest PSP firmwares as they're released, right?
906828	907448	No, but...
908308	913897	Then again, it shouldn't matter though because they don't remove anything from the PSP firmwares.
914118	922231	To be honest, I don't have any legitimate firmwares, but it doesn't matter because they're the exact same thing plus other added bonuses.
923417	927539	I want to read this comment from earlier, because I'm not sure if it's on the right track or not.
927579	932502	Shaoran said, Jamie also has bad memories involving things like Warhammer, right?
932702	934303	Is that true or not?
934703	937825	The Warhammer with the little models, yeah.
938145	938665	What happened?
938926	942828	I had an ex who would play Warhammer to the exclusion of all else.
943728	944048	Yikes.
944729	946850	And I would have to sit and paint his models.
947170	950834	Do you think that he's gotten sucked into this thing beyond belief at this point?
950954	951895	Dude, I don't know.
951935	953216	This is 12 years ago in Alabama.
955346	956287	That was worth asking.
957568	958528	I don't care what happened.
958549	959769	Was it Warhammer or Warhammer 40,000?
959909	961931	It was Warhammer 40k.
963592	969376	Keep in mind, my review comes from somebody who has never touched a Warhammer model or done any of that stuff.
969716	971998	I did get vengeance on him once.
972398	972779	How so?
972999	978543	He had some sort of big figure that was like this hulking creature and I painted it hot pink.
980724	980924	Nice.
981125	981905	That was pretty cool.
982425	982726	Awesome.
983584	983924	All right.
983984	986986	Well, also pretty cool, some video game news.
987626	988966	Loki, start us off tonight, would you?
989507	989847	All right.
990447	1001432	Well, this time, I mean, I think we may have talked about this a little bit before, but Rock Revolution, as if you needed more reasons why it's not going to be that great.
1001892	1011897	Well, Konami says that they're not actually going to put out any guitars for it, so you're going to need to find your own guitars, whether that be a Guitar Hero guitar, a Rock Band guitar, a third-party guitar.
1012759	1022010	you're just going to need another guitar because if you don't own a music game and for some reason you decide this is the one you want to start off with well all you're going to be able to get is just the drums and that's it.
1022697	1023358	No guitars for you.
1046239	1062890	The thing is, they're just not going to make a guitar whatsoever, and that's fine if they don't want to do it, but I've had Konami reps before tell me, oh, we're not in the peripheral business, but yet you have peripherals bundled with your DDR bundles, so you're a liar, basically.
1063771	1070035	But yeah, they're not trying to be in the peripheral business, yet they're making a game with peripherals, so they're kind of...
1071226	1074728	Well, plus the fact that it's not like Konami's never made a guitar controller before.
1075228	1076349	They just didn't do it here.
1076469	1078470	It's probably they just don't want to make another one.
1078870	1087474	They probably have reasons, and it's maybe something to do with the fact that they've licensed out their design for guitars to other companies or something.
1087534	1092436	Maybe there's something legal that we don't see yet.
1092637	1097579	I mean, that's part of the lawsuit or something, and that's why they didn't do it, and that's why they only did drum controller.
1099570	1115995	I'm thinking that's got to be the reason, because if you notice, the drum controllers that they have out there, they're not exactly rip-offs of the original Drum Mania controller, except for Konami's, which is obviously, it looks like kind of a rip-off of the original Drum Mania controller, but they can do that since it's theirs.
1116815	1117895	And it sucked, for the record.
1118556	1125918	Yeah, so that's my thing, is that maybe these people are paying to license these guitars or something, and
1127020	1129361	I don't know, a non-compete thing or something?
1129461	1129781	I don't know.
1149488	1150169	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1171966	1174608	Well, I think it's also, you know, the guitar not included.
1174808	1177770	I don't even remember if they have vocals in this as well.
1177810	1184054	I think they... No, they don't have vocals in it before they were going to, but they axed it, it looks like.
1184694	1197582	So it's just a guitar and drums, and... I don't know, I don't think it's a big deal, because shit, you can buy used guitars, like used Guitar Hero 2 guitars for like $12, so... It doesn't really matter, but...
1199437	1199757	I don't know.
1199978	1200378	Whatever.
1200438	1201118	Do what they want to do.
1201139	1202239	The game's going to suck anyways.
1203280	1204501	You sure?
1204962	1207904	And again, having not played it, what's your basis for this?
1208004	1209586	My basis for it is it looks cheap.
1209966	1211688	All the videos I've seen from it look cheap.
1211788	1214130	All the gameplay from it I've seen looks very cheap.
1214690	1216272	It just looks like a cheap knockoff.
1216532	1221296	And that's sad because they were the ones that pioneered this, but it's just a cheap knockoff.
1221977	1230265	What their problem was is they did it right to start with in Japan, but they didn't realize that their American user base would be interested in the same stuff too.
1230305	1232668	So they started way too late.
1232968	1239515	And I'll quote Bobby that one of the icons for the drum is actually a dark gray.
1241036	1241517	Come on.
1242037	1242758	That's retarded.
1243188	1244048	What were you thinking?
1244268	1260872	You know, and I've said this on the show before, I don't know if I want to continue to beat a dead horse, but, you know, in a way, if Konami is going to assume, you know, what happens about assuming that this stuff is not going to take off in America, you know, then they have no one to blame but themselves for what's happening now.
1261332	1271494	I mean, and this sounds all conspiracy theory-like, but I really think that they're making this so that it doesn't do well, so that they can sue them, so they have reason to...
1272014	1275696	to say, hey, look, your game is causing our game not to sell.
1277737	1281900	But I don't think that that would fly in court and they know it.
1282620	1283581	They'd have to know better.
1283601	1293366	All right, well, let's see what you guys, the listeners, thought because OLR is the show where every... How long ago did they register any licenses for Guitar Freaks or Drum Mania over here?
1293386	1295368	They did Guitar Revolution a while back.
1295388	1297509	Well, they also had an arcade release of Guitar Freaks here.
1297849	1299310	So, you know, that's years old.
1299330	1300771	I don't know if that would count for a console.
1301151	1301251	Hmm.
1302264	1305286	Guitar Revolution, Drummer Revolution, Rock Revolution
1330061	1333864	and I think it's been pretty well known now that yes, it's working with both.
1334144	1334784	So that's a yes.
1335605	1338367	Picaruno says, hell no, because that's the answer I gave last time.
1338627	1340828	I guess during the show we must have asked this before once.
1341469	1346632	TheSag said, no, I enjoy the careful selection Harmonix practices in their setlist.
1347012	1348574	They are game designers of music.
1348614	1350115	So kind of going back to the setlist.
1351295	1353877	K. Rose says, I won't buy it.
1354117	1356199	I only like Konami games for the Japanese music.
1356299	1359701	If it's localized, I'll get a better rhythm band game like Rock Band.
1360181	1365342	Interesting perspective that, you know, they didn't bring over anything from Japan, so there are folks that like that.
1365382	1369443	Although, I gotta say though, you're kind of a niche market in that case.
1369783	1377145	You know, I think it would be nice if somebody would release a game that has some of the US stuff and that, but you're never gonna see a game released over here that's all that.
1377165	1379126	You wanna hear something else that's kind of retarded about this too?
1379146	1379306	What?
1379786	1382806	The game only version of this is coming out in early October.
1383147	1389148	The actual instruments, the drums, and those bundles aren't coming until like mid-November.
1390928	1392029	Rock Band 2 is the same way.
1392249	1404353	Well, they're just doing that now because they have the exclusive for it, but it's still stupid because if you want to try their unique drums or whatever, how many people are going to buy this game and just go, eh, whatever, I'm not going to buy the drums now.
1404433	1405574	Now they're stuck with a bunch of drums.
1405990	1409912	Alright, going back to the Twitter question, are you going to buy Rock Revolution?
1409932	1412814	GS68 says, I'm too ghetto to bother shelling out the monies for it.
1413294	1419578	Actdeft says no, because Konami failed to do this years ago, and they should have, and they're not even offering something at the level of Rock Band Guitar Hero.
1419938	1424281	Goldanthro says no, because if I was going to spend the money for a game like that, I'd buy Guitar Hero or Rock Band.
1425001	1430104	MarinMarvel says no, it's too little too late for Konami to try to jump back into the music game business in the US.
1430424	1431545	They've already failed hardcore.
1432065	1435026	Justin says, all covers in an archaic interface?
1435326	1435887	No thank you.
1436227	1437547	Plus the drums look like ass.
1437567	1438808	Konami missed the boat years ago.
1440949	1442389	I can never say this name.
1443790	1445070	Giovedea?
1446171	1447371	Giovedea, I think?
1448092	1450472	I got lessons on how to pronounce it last week, but I already forgot.
1450793	1452113	I think it's Giovedea.
1452533	1455935	As DJ Ranma S said, only if it works with the stuff I already have.
1456835	1460919	Javier Altman says, because we already have enough plastic instrument stuff.
1461660	1463121	Konami is too late for their own good.
1463161	1465243	The last Bossa da Santa has been played.
1466204	1471029	Sponge Twang says, I will wait out most likely into next year after the dust has settled.
1471350	1473872	I need to figure which plastic instruments work with which games.
1474252	1479658	DJ Tyrant says, depends on how good the execution is since it's compatible with Rock Band 2 Guitar Hero gear.
1480038	1482239	I might pick it up, but they are very late to the party.
1482679	1489801	And lastly, Chad28 says, No, because they are mostly songs that have already been used in other Guitar Hero Rock Band games and no master tracks.
1490782	1491242	There you have it.
1492402	1494483	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1495223	1496763	And, um, yeah.
1498324	1500205	So, alright, well, we'll see what happens.
1500245	1504066	I mean, it's really hard to make an ultimate decision until the game actually comes out.
1504346	1507027	I would just, if you're unsure about it, just wait, because...
1507927	1508988	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1533880	1535341	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1557378	1563767	It could be interesting, especially if the timetable is stepped up for the releases, what this annual subscription model could do.
1564087	1564648	What do you guys think?
1564688	1566511	Is the subscription model a good idea, a bad idea?
1566531	1567572	I don't think it's a good idea.
1567993	1568333	Why is that?
1568573	1569635	Because you don't know what's coming out.
1570035	1570596	I mean, that's...
1571581	1572401	That's kind of stupid.
1572441	1575723	Who knows what they're going to put out and what frequency it's going to be coming out as.
1576163	1578984	I mean, there might be a lot of stuff that you're not really interested in.
1579744	1590068	I would say you'd have... I think the better deal is the way that Rock Band's doing it where you have a bundle of songs you can pay for and if you want all of them, you get it at a buck cheaper or something like that.
1590909	1599252	Or you can buy individual songs because if you pay, say, $60 a year or whatever for the subscription model or whatever, what if it's not worth it to you?
1599272	1601333	I mean, all these songs coming out...
1601793	1602955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1621514	1623375	What if they did something to that effect?
1623775	1627797	Where they say, this is our exclusive featured track, you can only get it this way.
1628557	1631098	However, if you don't want it, then choose something else.
1631239	1633339	Well, and then also the other thing comes too.
1633419	1640583	It's nice that they want to do this, but is this actual model built into Xbox Live Marketplace or PlayStation Network?
1640623	1643084	Now we know PlayStation Network can do it because they obviously have...
1643484	1646745	Their core subscription model, and you can pay for stuff that way.
1646765	1647125	Why not?
1647205	1650146	There's two MMOs on Xbox 360 that have subscription models.
1650446	1652266	Phantasy Star Universe and Final Fantasy XI.
1652607	1654927	Yeah, but those are done through their own individual servers.
1655927	1657448	But you still pay for it on Xbox Live.
1658388	1658768	That's true.
1659328	1662529	In the case of the Phantasy Star Universe, you actually pay for that on Xbox Live.
1662969	1664350	So it's got to be there.
1664990	1668691	They actually have you input all of your billing information right before you can start.
1669373	1672215	VX Jason XV comes up with an interesting point in chat.
1672435	1676118	Loki, you don't know what music comes out in the real world either until it's about to or does.
1676438	1679460	This is fundamentally nothing different from actual music subscription services.
1680280	1684783	But at the same time, I mean, to kind of... But at the same time, though, it's not necessarily just...
1686204	1687405	I mean, what are they going to do?
1687445	1691828	You have to pay for this service to get access to all the download content?
1691888	1693589	Or are you just going to get access to the new stuff?
1693629	1710301	Because, like, say if I'm on Rhapsody or, you know, Napster or whatever Napster's got to have, I mean, I'm just pulling this number out of my butt But Napster's got to have hundreds of thousands of songs on it Exactly, that's a little different thing And Guitar Hero has a bucket full, maybe Not a room full, you know what I mean?
1711062	1712723	Exactly, it's totally different
1714145	1721415	All right, well... Unless they're going to start pumping out, you know, 20 tracks a week or something like that, then that's different, but I don't think they are.
1721715	1727583	You know, I notice a lot of people are kind of turning their noses up as subscription models, but, I mean, that's pretty much how all MMOs work.
1727623	1729786	And also, the other thing you have to look at, too, is...
1730287	1730827	Thanks for watching!
1751404	1758810	What I'm thinking might work is sort of what I'm going back to what I was saying before about having the exclusive subscription only stuff.
1759390	1771640	If they have like certain things that are available only through subscription and they have their regular bundle packs that everybody has access to but there's only certain really good stuff available to people who are in the fan club.
1772759	1782166	What about like a, just kind of really going off wild here, what about like a Guitar Hero magazine or something, or a tie-in with a rock magazine or something that would come with a CD with bonus tracks?
1782186	1789651	Because I'm thinking rock bands kind of done that, like the Xbox, what, official Xbox magazine had like three bonus songs on it at once, so you can only get there.
1790011	1792573	Well, I think they came out for download eventually, but a long time later.
1792773	1798877	And there was the deal about buying the soundtrack that gave you the bonus songs.
1799198	1799338	Hmm.
1800154	1801294	All right, well, we'll see.
1801374	1802035	We'll see what happens.
1802055	1805375	I mean, new ideas, never a bad thing to try new things.
1805415	1807696	The worst that can happen is you fall on your face and fail.
1808336	1812417	But hopefully they'll still keep kind of both options available, but we'll see what happens.
1812477	1812757	Who knows?
1813438	1817519	Well, it looks like Activision's getting something right in the UK and Ireland.
1818439	1819920	Thank you for watching!
1839576	1847461	It's going to be the same Red Octane one that's the Guitar Hero 3 peripheral for PS3.
1847481	1851984	This is UK only, just to reiterate.
1852264	1855966	And they're saying that there's a release date early November.
1857847	1860929	So that's pretty interesting, I think.
1862170	1868134	But it would be available to any retailer and consumers can pre-order either online or in-store.
1869039	1869940	I want free stuff.
1870800	1871401	It's not fair.
1872161	1873863	Yeah, but they're giving them old guitars.
1874843	1875524	But it's free!
1876304	1876665	Oh, okay.
1877425	1878426	I gave you a kick in the balls.
1878526	1878966	It's free.
1879807	1880287	Go to hell.
1881068	1886192	Yeah, but unlike a kick in the balls, which is somewhat entertaining... Sorry, Rob.
1887092	1887893	How would you know?
1888553	1889054	I'm a girl.
1889254	1890315	They're very entertaining to watch.
1891936	1892416	And deliver.
1894638	1896079	You'll never be the recipient of one.
1896960	1897743	Exactly.
1898787	1899410	But anyway...
1901261	1906443	I think that it's actually, first of all, it's a good way to get rid of some overstock if that's half of the case.
1907023	1909444	Another way, I think you can never have too many peripherals.
1909905	1910945	I love peripherals.
1910985	1914106	I have a room in my house dedicated to peripherals.
1914286	1916327	You are also a freak in that regard.
1916487	1917348	You know what?
1917408	1918308	You've seen the vault.
1918368	1919829	No, I mean that with love.
1919989	1921649	But you know you are a freak in that regard.
1921669	1926551	Whereas I won't even get the fucking drum set for Rock Band because I'm like, I just don't need any more shit in my house.
1927632	1928472	But I have a whole room.
1929773	1930673	You have to get a vault, Rob.
1931266	1931746	No vault.
1931966	1932667	This is the vault.
1933347	1937209	My freaking garage is now an internet radio station hub.
1937229	1938990	There is room here for a drum kit.
1939830	1940370	A real one.
1940510	1941191	Do not want.
1942051	1942971	Pinball machine, yes.
1943031	1943672	Drum kit, no.
1943972	1944772	You want to buy our Black Knight?
1944992	1945793	I don't know.
1945893	1946233	I'm poor.
1947073	1950455	The Rock Band 2 drums are actually being delivered to my work on Wednesday.
1950535	1952336	Your wife is going to punch you in the face.
1953276	1954437	I'm getting rid of the old ones.
1954577	1955337	I'm upgrading.
1955417	1955877	Whatever.
1955897	1956958	What are you going to do with the old ones?
1957737	1959485	Uh, give them to my sister, I think.
1959887	1960068	Maybe.
1960972	1961253	Gotcha.
1962639	1967284	Anyways, so some other interesting stuff about Guitar Hero, and I guess this is a little bit of trivia.
1967764	1975651	The Metallica mix of their brand new album is actually better in Guitar Hero than it is on the actual CD.
1975812	1987302	In fact, the new Death Magnet album has been mixed too loud, they say, and is actually sacrificing audio quality in favor of a louder sounding product.
1987763	1988023	Well...
1988971	1995653	Guitar Hero, on the other hand, is actually a little bit more balanced, so you actually have a little bit more depth in the audio in there.
1996153	2000175	So a lot of people are thinking, hey, let's just rip the audio from Guitar Hero instead.
2000915	2003316	Okay, wouldn't this be a matter of opinion, though?
2003896	2007337	No, they actually looked at the audio.
2007417	2008797	They actually ran it through a...
2011027	2018394	Waveform Editor, and it showed how they had it capped in there for the CD audio versus Guitar Hero.
2018454	2022978	It actually was significantly better on Guitar Hero.
2023419	2027983	Is this one of those things that only crazy audiophiles would really notice?
2028924	2031026	What about Joe Average Headbanger?
2031586	2038389	They may not care, but I actually did listen to some of the portions of it when they were comparing it.
2038490	2039670	It does sound distorted.
2039690	2042151	It sounds like someone just recorded it too loud.
2042171	2043192	But it's Metallica!
2043252	2044953	It's supposed to be loud!
2045053	2045653	You know what I mean?
2045693	2047294	I kind of expected it to be distorted.
2047314	2050735	It's supposed to be loud, but you're supposed to turn up your radio.
2050755	2050915	To 11!
2051776	2055918	Okay, you're not supposed to record it loud and then turn it up, because then it'll sound all fucked up.
2058171	2058931	They should know this.
2059011	2059631	I mean, hell.
2059712	2060332	I mean, come on.
2060352	2061012	Hitstun agrees.
2061052	2067354	Hitstun says the CD has mad clipping and Alpha Cananogram agrees it's too much clicking in our chatroom.
2067754	2069255	I think they should replace everyone's CDs.
2069555	2070355	That's my opinion.
2070835	2071735	It's that bad?
2071875	2072155	Really?
2072756	2073316	I think they should.
2073856	2074596	Well, I guess so.
2074656	2081899	I mean, especially when the CD, in some regard, the old-fashioned CD market is struggling to survive in a way.
2082339	2084079	This is a pretty big screw-up in that regard.
2084099	2085560	This is what you get for buying CDs.
2086927	2087648	I'm just telling you.
2088068	2089549	See, this is what Metallica thinks of you.
2089569	2090569	They're all, fuck you guys.
2090649	2092551	We're going to just re-record it all fucked up.
2092891	2094011	Ha, you bought the CD.
2094072	2094852	Now you're stuck, bitches.
2094892	2096033	Somehow I doubt that.
2096573	2097834	Somehow I doubt that.
2098234	2099695	Play rock band or guitar hero.
2099986	2108469	All right, well, look, if you want to play more Guitar Hero, especially Guitar Hero World Tour, you can use your rock band drums with Guitar Hero World Tour.
2108529	2111170	And this story is kind of making the rounds of the blog, so I don't know.
2111410	2113251	I thought I already kind of knew some of this, but whatever.
2114351	2114851	Here's the thing.
2115431	2125395	What happens if you use a rock band drum set in Guitar Hero World Tour, and this is kind of demonstrated at a World Tour preview event that happened earlier this week, what
2126155	2138168	Basically what will happen is that the pad that's all the way on the right on the five note chart will actually kind of go over to the other orange pad instead.
2138528	2141111	But sometimes there will be some other logic as well.
2141471	2145212	Like, if there's already an orange note in there, it might actually move it to a blue note.
2145972	2150153	So there is, it's not just necessarily eliminating the fifth one altogether.
2150573	2154053	Like, and I think that's kind of where this is kind of resurfacing in news reports.
2154073	2158194	Because I think the early things we thought is that that fifth one would just get eliminated altogether.
2158494	2161714	But no, those notes are going to get moved, basically, to other drops.
2161794	2163115	Which is kind of neat, in a way.
2163515	2165975	Which is also good for score comparison and everything.
2166015	2168176	Does it truly cape everything on the same page?
2168836	2169696	Or what?
2169736	2170616	Is this going to be an advantage?
2172193	2174834	using one controller over the other because one's four and one's five.
2175294	2176054	I don't think it matters.
2177175	2179996	But then again, I'm not super duper into drums as well, right?
2180296	2180496	Yeah.
2181196	2181416	So.
2181816	2182016	Hmm.
2183717	2184017	I don't know.
2184257	2188399	So I got sent a link to a YouTube that's supposed to compare the two Metallica tracks.
2188419	2189279	You want to hear it a little bit?
2189759	2189959	Sure.
2190099	2190980	I've already listened to it.
2191040	2191680	All right, let's hear it.
2195621	2199443	You can hear right there how it's all... Let's see.
2199463	2199883	There we go.
2224239	2227062	I bet you this is a radio show.
2227222	2232206	You didn't get to see what we saw on our screen, which would show you which clips were Guitar Hero and which clips were the CD.
2232466	2233907	I bet you people at home couldn't tell the difference.
2236269	2240012	Now, granted, this show is delivered at a lower bitrate, but I think this is one of those things.
2240072	2242895	And you can see it in the visuals, absolutely.
2242935	2244336	You can see, look at the waveforms.
2244396	2246098	They absolutely look different.
2247018	2248299	But I bet you guys couldn't tell the difference.
2248319	2251322	But what's the audio quality on YouTube?
2252376	2253056	Not that great.
2253376	2259077	So I think that you're not going to be able to tell until you actually have the two side by side in person.
2260118	2261578	It's like, okay, here's an example.
2263098	2272540	When Symphony of the Night came out on Saturn, Dan and I actually did a side by side comparison because we had seen one done online that we couldn't hear the difference in the music quality.
2272940	2274620	But when we did it on our TV, we could.
2275541	2277021	When we had them both running side by side.
2278393	2281315	Alright, some people in chat room say, yes, I hear the difference.
2281395	2282115	It's very clear.
2282375	2282675	I don't know.
2282715	2284056	Sometimes I think people just want to argue.
2284256	2286097	But alright, I'm going to be honest.
2286137	2288519	If I closed my eyes, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell you the difference.
2289540	2290821	All I can tell you is the Metallica album.
2290841	2291361	But I understand.
2291481	2292542	I can see the difference.
2292902	2293882	I get the point.
2293962	2295303	I get what you guys are saying.
2295343	2298725	I heard the new album is mediocre anyway, so what do we even care about it?
2298885	2304548	It's just like saying Barney is not in high def quality.
2304628	2305909	It's just in normal quality.
2305969	2306950	What the fuck?
2307270	2307750	It doesn't matter.
2307810	2308350	It's Barney.
2308410	2309211	No one gives a shit.
2311852	2313213	That's my comparison there.
2314136	2314976	The real Tom Sawyer Yes I am
2345967	2354150	The actual version of Tom Sawyer kicking off the Moving Pictures album is finally making its way to a rock band this week, they swear.
2354510	2359891	And of course, you know, other songs like YYZ, Limelight, you know, those are all from Moving Pictures.
2361592	2370855	Not a lot of songs on that album, but considering it was kind of epic and the albums were only like seven or eight tracks back then and that The Camera Eye is an 11 freaking minute song.
2372714	2374515	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2400911	2401691	I'm definitely picking it.
2402011	2405092	I may not get the whole album, but I do love me some Tom Sawyer.
2405112	2407333	That was one of my favorite songs in the first rock band.
2407553	2409793	I think the real version is much better than the cover version.
2410753	2412014	I want to get that at least.
2412854	2414794	Maybe YYZ or Limelight.
2414814	2415894	I don't know yet.
2415914	2420795	11-minute song, do not want because that will show up in my random playlist, guaranteed.
2421876	2423356	I don't want to get the whole album, sorry.
2425500	2430757	Tom Sawyer is a really, really freaking good song That's a great album in general It is
2431926	2433066	Canada knows how to rock.
2433587	2434087	Here's your proof.
2434267	2434587	Alright.
2435447	2436568	Alright.
2437148	2449013	So another interesting thing about Guitar Hero, and this has been kind of circling around a little bit, that mystery instrument that G4 hinted to, it's not really an instrument at all, it's a MIDI sequencer.
2449953	2450454	That's right.
2451254	2454775	They're going to be adding a MIDI sequencer that will allow you to...
2456796	2479471	Import creations like MIDI files from your PC into Guitar Hero World Tour, as well as allowing you to, I guess, at least on the PS3, you'll be able to import different tracks including instruments, rhythm lead, guitar, bass, keyboards, and drum tracks.
2479811	2483754	However, on the 360, you'll only be limited to drums due to hardware issues.
2484674	2492099	I don't understand what hardware issues they could be having that would prevent them from doing this, but whatever.
2493560	2495281	So yeah, I guess it's kind of interesting.
2495401	2500044	No word on price or when it's going to be released, but a MIDI sequencer.
2500124	2505227	If you're really hardcore into making, I guess, tracks on there.
2505447	2506768	That actually sounds kind of awesome, though.
2507523	2508283	I think I'd use it.
2521175	2524317	TigerClaw in chat says, I think you could also create techno on that.
2524397	2524758	Could you?
2525098	2527079	Could you make different genres of music and stuff?
2527479	2528340	Why not, right?
2528820	2540649	You could make... Well, I was telling them about drum and bass stuff, and they said that, yeah, you can make whatever to your heart's content on there, so you could make a drum and bass track or a techno track if you're that creative.
2541489	2542070	Interesting.
2542810	2548014	That's the only thing that kind of makes me want to buy maybe just the game-only version or something, just to check that out.
2549568	2549908	I don't know.
2550028	2550788	I'll wait and see.
2574366	2576527	and what was that show, Out of Control?
2577667	2578407	Out of Control, yes.
2578427	2579607	That show was great.
2582628	2583248	Kids in the Hall.
2583268	2584789	Kids in the Hall, like Matt just said.
2585029	2588610	And what is that dish with the french fries with gravy, poutain or whatever?
2588650	2589790	That stuff is good.
2591591	2592131	Stuff is awesome.
2592191	2592971	And maple syrup.
2594932	2595632	Yes, maple.
2596232	2596852	Alright, forget it.
2597872	2599033	We love Canada, come on.
2599113	2599553	And hockey.
2601331	2603112	Alright, I think Blackwell's just giving us a hard time.
2603312	2606354	Now he's really starting to argue with us just for the sake of arguing.
2606515	2607215	I think that's what's happening.
2607635	2609517	Alright, how about some release dates?
2610537	2611178	Do we gotta?
2612956	2638812	Well, coming out for our friends in the UK, and pardon my death voice, on the 24th, Duke Nukem 3D for Xbox 360, 25th is Pure on some systems, 26th is the rest of everything, Vampire Story, Baja Edge of Control, Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway, Don King Presents Prize Fighter, Family Trainer on Wii, and

2658445	2659426	Alright, awesome.
2659446	2660206	That game's gonna be great.
2660887	2662188	Forgot that that's actually coming out.
2664309	2666390	And Nintendo's been doing a great job marketing that.
2666891	2668592	And by great, I mean not really.
2669335	2669856	PC, PC, PC, PC, PC
2691067	2694349	Baja, The Edge of Control Kirby, Superstar Ultra on the DS Kirby Clouds
2717226	2724910	And I doubt this is coming out, but apparently the Symbol Pack 2 pack for Rock Band 2 is supposed to be out.
2725110	2726711	I heard that it's supposed to be October.
2727292	2730333	And of course, you go to a GameStop and you ask them, Hey, when are the Symbols coming out?
2730353	2731334	Your website says the 22nd.
2731554	2733075	And we're like, I don't know!
2733735	2735836	So, the hell with them.
2736957	2740359	You can get a box set of the Command & Conquer games for Command & Conquer 3.

2792774	2793956	Hey, quick question.
2794036	2796758	Does anyone give a shit about BrainQuest grade 3, 4, 5, 6?
2797499	2801002	Because I'm thinking we can make this segment a little shorter.
2801342	2802063	No, we can't.
2803084	2807548	By cutting out the games that not a single OLR listener cares about.
2807648	2808229	Not a one.
2809278	2812060	That is being biased right there.
2812080	2813781	It is completely biased, but also true.
2813801	2814882	Hey, we've got parents to listen.
2814922	2815362	Who knows?
2815442	2817604	Maybe they want to get something for their kid.
2817624	2818624	Maybe you're full of poop.
2818644	2821406	Something that says, hey, look, I know you like games, but I hate you.
2821506	2822407	You know, that kind of thing.
2823648	2825889	And they might also get them Barbie Fashion Show.
2826009	2827530	Eye for style for the DS.

2829052	2830372	Dinosaur King coming out.

2897386	2899286	Lost and Blue Shipwrecked on the Wii.
2900367	2904068	My Japanese Coach, that moved to October, so that date's wrong.
2904668	2906689	Bastards have incorrect dates on their website.
2907949	2913471	Rebel Raiders on the Wii, although that game sucks balls, so I wouldn't recommend buying it.
2915899	2917139	Lots of stuff this week, I guess.
2917820	2923541	Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2009 coming out on 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, and Wii.

2981467	2986108	Rihanna, Umbrella, Ella, Ella, A, A, A. I actually don't like that song.
2986369	2988149	I like the remix.
2988209	2992091	Under My Umbrella, Ella, Ella, A. I only like the remix.
2992451	2995012	A, A. All right, all right, enough of that.
2995132	2996352	That's annoying, seriously.
2996852	2999113	Rhapsody, a musical adventure on the DS.
2999133	3000054	Rob, Rob.

3074704	3078987	Bomberman comes out on September 25th, as does Disaster Day of Crisis.
3079367	3083110	SimCity Creator, the simple 2000 series for the Wii.
3083390	3084531	The Table Game, Volume 1.
3085072	3089195	So, Loki, you like the simple series on the Game Boy Advance, right?
3089675	3091296	So now you have these games coming out on the Wii.
3091837	3094399	I used to check out some of the stuff on the PlayStation 2.
3095419	3099543	The Wii stuff, I've gotten a couple, but I haven't actually played them.
3100123	3101064	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

3170840	3170940	Sweet.
3170960	3171460	I see secret cosplay.
3199989	3203791	Looks like a lot of fanboy fantasies might come true with that game, so you might want to check that out.
3203811	3205312	I think it's a fetish game.
3205632	3206032	Nice!
3206673	3207833	I think it's a fetish game.
3208073	3208533	That's awesome.
3208593	3209754	It's secret cosplay.
3210654	3225982	Coming out in Japan on the Nintendo DS, Gabu Gabu Planet, Knights in the Nightmare, Princess Maker 4 Special Edition, and a game you might know from here in the US, Guitar Hero on Tour makes its way to Japan on the Nintendo DS this week.
3227122	3254541	also lastly on the Sony PSP taking a look to see if anything is coming out next week Patapon gets a price reduction because that game has been very popular Princess Maker 5 Portable it is a Princess Maker week this week you got new ones on the PSP and a price reduction on the DS what a week there you have it your Japanese release dates alright let's get back into some news after the release dates
3257127	3259308	Well, in other news, sorry.
3260549	3265693	And this is actually very happy for me because I love freakin' Metal Slug.
3266953	3268434	Don't we all know this already, right?
3269095	3269655	I heard a rumor.
3271690	3284512	Well, it looks like SNK is going to be doing a high def version sort of like how some of the other old school games have gone.
3285092	3286233	So that might be cool.
3288253	3290734	I just want it to still play like Metal Slug.
3292034	3293834	I don't want it to be 3D.
3294794	3298095	I want it to be 2D with very high res pretty pretties.
3298817	3299177	Fogger going 3D
3329226	3330647	Yeah, something was always weird about that.
3330867	3340392	Yeah, so I think that they would be in their best interest to keep the 2D or to go the, you know what I mean by the 2.5D, sort of like how Street Fighter 4 is doing.
3340892	3342934	You know, where it's 3D but plays 2D.
3344114	3345415	I'm all for the 2.5D.
3345695	3347215	Like, what was it?
3347776	3348536	Fantasy Zone.
3349116	3351597	The Sega Ages one that I have.
3352198	3354859	It still played just like the 2D one.
3354959	3356119	It was all cel-shaded.
3356159	3364203	You couldn't really tell it was 3D, except it would do rotations in some places, and it gave it a little bit more depth to it.
3364743	3368625	I think that they should do something like that, or if not, just go the high-res route.
3372318	3374439	Well, we'll see if we get more information on this soon.
3377921	3378382	Let's see.
3379182	3385906	Well, in other news, and this is actually pretty cool, Nintendo may actually have a chance to redeem itself.
3386486	3391349	They're actually holding a media summit in early October, supposedly on the 2nd and 3rd.
3391469	3393791	This has already been confirmed for Japan.
3395165	3397147	What they're going to talk about, who knows?
3398248	3400670	But the event also, there's supposed to be a U.S.
3400730	3403532	event as well taking place in San Francisco around the same time.
3405093	3420745	Guesses, of course, would be the announcement of Disaster Day of Crisis, since it's already been announced for the Japanese market, obviously, since it's coming out next week, and for Europe, because it's coming out in October, but no word on a U.S.
3420805	3421426	release yet.
3422974	3440693	and you know other rumors or thoughts may be that they're going to announce that Conduit's being published by them now maybe some new games or something like that but we'll have to see maybe a storage solution who knows I would like to hear that that would be a wonderful announcement
3441547	3442748	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3459696	3462060	Microsoft's gonna buy Nintendo and they're gonna conquer the world.
3462420	3468309	Well, what's kind of interesting, there actually was kind of a little bit of truth to that.
3468790	3473317	And that was explained by Peter Moore, who was talking in an interview this week.
3474018	3475500	He actually mentioned during the interview...
3475880	3487090	So, Balmer wanted to know, and that was an individual that he worked with at Microsoft, Steve Balmer, wanted to know how it was going to win for Microsoft, how we were going to take on Sony, how we would compete with or acquire Nintendo.
3487551	3489092	Those were the conversations in those days.
3489392	3491234	It was a classic build-or-buy conversation.
3491554	3493856	Interestingly, we were just completely fixated on Sony.
3493996	3495718	Nintendo didn't even come into the conversation.
3496198	3497860	Notice that way he said that, though.
3498180	3500582	Compete with or acquire Nintendo.
3500602	3501043	Yeah.
3501443	3503143	BlackWolf chimes in and says Nintendo laughed at Microsoft.
3503163	3504444	They actually did have a meeting.
3528158	3535202	And, you know, when you've got a very, very American company and a very, very Japanese company in that regard, it kind of doesn't surprise me.
3536842	3537323	You know what I mean?
3538503	3545867	So, I think sometimes our perspective might be a little skewed, being over here at what's just a ginormous company and what power Nintendo has.
3546287	3551230	But it's interesting that in some regards, in that way, they've kind of worked together a bit.
3551950	3552050	Hmm.
3552981	3556462	Well, other neat things, Nintendo.
3557042	3562464	Of course, they only teased this very briefly during the E3 media event.
3563624	3568926	But Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars, now there's a little bit more details coming out from Nintendo Power.
3569906	3574848	And the game itself is actually going to be a cel-shaded isometric game.
3575468	3577128	It is still going to be M-rated.
3577188	3578769	Of course, it's still going to be a crime drama.
3579129	3582650	They actually had some screenshots to look... It sort of resembles, I guess...
3584378	3590426	A little bit like the old Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2, just kind of shot a little different.
3591507	3593650	Almost like the Grand Theft Auto cell phone games that they had.
3594571	3595993	But it looks neat.
3596213	3597495	It'll be interesting to check out.
3599377	3602781	So as a Grand Theft Auto fan, you're interested?
3603686	3604927	I'm interested to check it out.
3605248	3609471	Some of the artwork looks kind of weird, but it'll be interesting to see how the game plays.
3609892	3614837	I'd be definitely willing to check it out because it's Grand Theft Auto and I love Grand Theft Auto.
3616758	3620682	They're saying, though, that the game is going to take place in a sizable portion of Liberty City.
3620702	3620742	Um...
3625086	3628890	The map has been altered from, of course, the console version, which only makes sense.
3629650	3633654	And the missions will also be shorter and can easily be restarted upon failure.
3634375	3638779	The D-pad is going to be used for aiming while the R button activates an auto-targeting.
3639639	3647427	And there is going to be a subtle auto-steering built into the driving controls as well, so you can shoot out the window and stuff like that.
3648047	3648548	Thank you for watching!
3664827	3665648	Very interesting.
3666048	3672234	I want to backtrack just a little bit, go into the last story, because sometimes our chat room is a little behind because of the delay from when we say something to when it goes out over the radio.
3672654	3677979	But kind of a comment on the whole Microsoft Nintendo thing and how I mentioned that Microsoft kind of plays nicely with the DS.
3678360	3681523	TigerClock gives an interesting comment in our chat room, chat.orange.radio.com.
3681823	3682504	and DarkSakura.com
3709266	3713490	I have a feeling that if they were to get into the handheld market, it wouldn't be with the Zune.
3714371	3718014	And if they did, I don't think they'd have trouble passing up the PSP.
3718575	3723299	The DS, on the other hand, though, I don't think they'd be able to beat.
3724431	3725152	Halo 3 is coming soon!
3742468	3746671	You may have to kind of clear out the cache first, though, before the download will actually happen there.
3747051	3760040	But once you get the new updates, there's going to be a brand new ranking system, some changes to the playlist, some brand new achievements, which will be cool, a complete overhaul to Bungie.net, which is pretty cool, and the Bungie.net website is slowly changing throughout the next week.
3760580	3768665	So, pretty cool there, and I know some of you achievement whores are very excited about new achievements, so you'll be able to check that out this Tuesday with the free update to Halo 3.
3770226	3770627	So there you go.
3774093	3779115	And other MMO news, there actually have been some more details put out about Star Trek Online.
3780135	3782196	I know that a few of us have been looking forward to this.
3783317	3797283	They actually said on the website that there are going to be more details coming out soon, but for right now, the ships are going to be something like naval combat using traditional MMO gameplay.
3798783	3822068	Klingon ships are going to be different a bit more reflecting of their culture everything will be very customizable you can modify and customize the uniforms of the characters but they still have to look like a uniform so the options are going to take things from the show and bring in some new things so it's supposed to be cool and is it supposed to be out in the next three years?
3823789	3824849	that's a long wait
3825839	3826459	I hope it's worth it.
3838266	3847852	Well, other fun PC games, of course, Spore, and one of the biggest complaints about Spore, of course, is some of the DRM restrictions.
3848393	3852375	Well, EA has heard your pleas, and they have decided to loosen them up a bit.
3852976	3857519	So now, some of the changes that they've had, and of course, without...
3859130	3860651	Deauthorize machines and move authorizations to new machines.
3884779	3892585	On top of that, they're going to allow you to log in multiple characters into each account.
3892605	3901132	You're going to be able to have up to five different players on each of your activations.
3902012	3902573	That's kind of cool.
3903186	3903346	Dream on!
3919870	3921872	I mean, that's just the way it's going to be.
3921932	3923073	This is the day and age we live in.
3923113	3924874	This is what they're going to try to do to protect their games.
3925194	3930879	Although it still does kind of suck that people crack it days before the release and the legitimate users have to suffer.
3931099	3933982	It's just like having a car alarm in your car.
3934002	3937585	I mean, it's not going to prevent people from stealing stuff out of your car.
3937985	3939246	It just makes it more difficult.
3939847	3942569	And it's just like the Securarm stuff and DRM stuff.
3942609	3943530	It's just going to make people...
3944488	3945149	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3966792	3967012	R.A.T.H.
3967032	3967893	of the Lich King
3989703	3990984	November 13th, 2008.
3992165	3996109	If you have some Warcrack addicted friends, expect them to call in sick on this day.
3996569	4003995	Because they probably will be working on heading up to Northrend and some of the new areas up there like the Howling Fjord and trying to level the characters to 80.
4005416	4011241	Maybe playing some Lake Wintergrasp, running some of the new instances, leveling Inscription or their new Death Knight.
4012082	4014504	Millions of different things to do in the new Warcraft expansion.
4015044	4016766	I'm looking forward to the dance studio myself.
4018077	4021183	You can teach characters new dances now, apparently, which is badly needed.
4021805	4023368	And also you can get your characters some haircuts.
4024270	4026996	So, very interesting how you can almost...
4029676	4031058	Micromanage even more.
4032419	4034522	That's the last thing our MMO needed, more micromanaging.
4035363	4035823	There you have it.
4036304	4041089	Well, there's a new add-on coming to World of Warcraft, and it's Bejeweled.
4041670	4047497	And oddly enough, this game started off as a kind of a third-party knockoff Bejeweled.
4048058	4049640	It was called Besharded.
4050380	4059504	and the developer Frumwiller actually kind of made it as a method of killing time during long raids and farming sessions.
4060485	4077833	But apparently PopCap caught wind of it and instead of having them stop making it, they actually hired him on to create a more polished version of the application that will be released for the game.
4079016	4080857	So you'll be able to play Bejeweled.
4081718	4083279	And my wife was excited to hear this.
4086821	4091323	So now if your wife gets sucked into getting World of Warcraft... Yeah, she's just going to be playing Bejeweled in there.
4091363	4092804	Just sitting there playing Bejeweled.
4095426	4095726	I know.
4095826	4097787	She'll go, Warcraft's the best game ever.
4099248	4100869	Because it has Bejeweled in it.
4102185	4103866	So, no, you were telling this on Bobby's show.
4103886	4105268	I don't think you told it on our show, though.
4105628	4108710	The wife is actually signing up for a Warcraft account thanks to Extifer.
4108910	4111633	Well, she's trying the 14-day trial.
4112213	4119399	She may actually do a month and 14 days because Extifer wants to get... I guess you get some recruitment bonuses or something like that.
4119759	4126004	Kind of like the military or something where you get special mounts or triple experience or some shit.
4126224	4126625	I don't know.
4126685	4127465	It's retarded, but...
4128426	4151523	um so she may indulge him in that but um yeah she's gonna try it i have to install it on this laptop that i'm using right now because you're that i buy her a new laptop she wants me to buy her a mac and i'm like fuck that shit oh my god i think now the wife is purposely trying to get into things that you don't like just to piss you off i don't know
4152642	4155263	I don't think she... The thing is, you have to know her.
4155284	4156624	She doesn't have the patience for it.
4157105	4159126	And she's going to quit very fast.
4160286	4167851	I will be very surprised if she actually... We should take bets on what level Nelly will quit at.
4168211	4170252	How far she gets her character up before she quits.
4170992	4171693	I'm down with that.
4173214	4174074	What would the bet be?
4174895	4176655	I don't know.
4176796	4178457	What does the loser have to do?
4178657	4180097	Or what does the loser get?
4180238	4180878	Or winner get...
4182316	4184397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4211752	4213674	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4239349	4247738	For lack of a better game, I picked Snake Rattle and Roll because I know it's a game that somebody I think is great really likes.
4248239	4249981	Oh, me?
4250501	4250742	No.
4251963	4252624	I really like it.
4254119	4258325	No, I put it on there for Sauce, although I think it's been a while since she's played it.
4258906	4264654	But it was a game that was made by Rare, and it came out on the NES in 1990.
4265195	4270822	It's one of the earliest platform games, but it's a 3D isometric playing field, sort of like how Marble Madness was.
4271783	4278087	Um, they, uh, actually, it didn't really sell all that great, but it was actually kind of a fun little game.
4278127	4279168	It was really difficult, too.
4279628	4286272	But the whole point is that you are two snakes called Battle and Roll, and you have to eat these little things called Nibbly Pibblies and race to the moon.
4287773	4289093	So, that's what you play.
4289193	4292735	There was supposed to be a sequel called Snakes and Things, but it was never made.
4292816	4301240	But there was Sneaky Snakes for Game Boy in 1991, and it had a version come out on the Mega Drive in 1993.
4302421	4303722	So, that's pretty cool.
4304202	4305823	I never knew there was a Mega Drive version of this.
4305903	4306444	It's kind of neat.
4306624	4306744	Yep.
4308955	4310075	Well, I like this game quite a bit.
4310095	4310656	It's actually a lot of fun.
4310716	4312157	I'm kind of sad we never got that sequel.
4312597	4313538	And this is a Rare game.
4314299	4320523	So, yet again, here's another great franchise that Rare could go back and revisit someday on, I don't know, Xbox Live Arcade.
4320904	4322345	But I somehow think they never will.
4323246	4323786	Which is sad.
4324366	4324967	It makes me cry.
4326188	4326488	Alright.
4327449	4328390	Well, it looks like that's it.
4328430	4329871	That's your Classic Game of the Week, folks!
4330271	4331732	Snake, Rattle, and Roll.
4332993	4334474	For the Nintendo Entertainment System.
4335475	4336896	But also on the Mega Drive, apparently.
4337076	4337917	Which I just learned tonight.
4338922	4343908	Alright, on that note, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4344268	4346070	And yes, we're going to talk about Mega Man 9.
4346110	4347872	We'll also talk about a new Suikoden game.
4348433	4350656	And we'll talk about Project Gotham Racing 5.
4350956	4353599	It's all coming up in Part B. So hey, don't go anywhere.
4353619	4354220	We'll be right back.
4362148	4363188	Having a bad day?
4364069	4365269	Job getting you down?
4366349	4368310	Are you looking for something to pick you up?
4368890	4370850	Give you a laugh all at the same time?
4371710	4373851	Then oh brother do I have the show for you.
4375912	4383954	I am Brad Boyer and join me each week on The Geek Spin as I scour the net to bring you the best in comedy music.
4384354	4387835	Check us out www.TheGeekSpin.com
4392107	4394729	How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?
4394749	4398311	We should have a rape carnival.
4400713	4402694	Tell them to rape things because rape is funny.
4405816	4408298	Walk around the neighborhood and rape cats in your neighborhood.
4408338	4409138	Hold a plastic knife.
4409158	4410079	You have to have a plastic knife.
4411040	4411780	And take pictures.
4413982	4416043	Ladies and gentlemen, rape isn't funny.
4417788	4418769	Unless if it's clown rape.
4441357	4441857	I'm Brad.
4442158	4442638	I'm Glenn.
4442778	4443499	And I'm Christina.
4443719	4447142	And we're from the PodCulture Podcast and PodCulture.net.
4447402	4453847	When you're done here and you find yourself hungry for some more geeky goodness, head on over and check us out at PodCulture.net.
4454127	4459451	From A-plus shows to grade Z movies and everything else in between like comics and video games.
4459731	4463414	Along with the occasional special musical guest, there's something for the geek in us all.
4463574	4467037	So let your geek flag fly and head on out to our little corner of the burst.
4467597	4469979	www.podculture.net.
4470359	4470980	PodCulture.
4471571	4472913	Equal Opportunity GeekNet.
4473353	4473934	Be seeing ya.
4483376	4487278	Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.
4487639	4493162	To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.
4493462	4495043	Well, except that asshole.
4495864	4498125	And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4498826	4507791	There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.
4509872	4512454	Welcome back kids to Orange Lounge Radio.
4513157	4515818	Here on this lovely Sunday evening, September the 21st, 2008.
4517278	4520539	Five weeks to go until episode 300, if you can believe it.
4520999	4525100	Yes, we've been on the air that long to have done 300 weekly episodes.
4526480	4530621	Obviously, we've missed a week here and there, so it's taken us a little over six years to get here.
4530741	4533082	But quite an accomplishment.
4533162	4536863	I don't know many other shows, if any, that have gotten to the 300 weekly show mark.
4537463	4540985	So, yeah, now we're trying to decide what exactly we're going to do to celebrate.
4541005	4542746	We're going to try to get some big guests on the show that week.
4542786	4548829	I know that I'm going to try to start sending some emails this week and just have a potpourri of big names on the show that week.
4549710	4551791	But otherwise, I'm not sure what other surprises we have in store.
4551831	4555713	But if you have suggestions, please email us or email me directly.
4555753	4557854	You can get all our contact information on the website.
4558454	4562719	Anyhow, we've got lots more gaming news to discuss and only a little bit of time to do it, so let's get back to it.
4562979	4565222	During the break, we heard some music from the new Mega Man 9.
4566343	4570627	Unfortunately, folks on the podcast don't get to hear that because of the whole copyright and all that stuff.
4570647	4576694	We can't offer it up for download, but live listeners did hear it, and I believe Loki's going to start us off with some Mega Man 9 news tonight.
4576994	4589497	Yes, in fact, if you liked Mega Man 9's music, you're going to like it even more when you can actually buy the game, which comes out on the 22nd or tomorrow if you're listening to us live on the WiiWare download service.
4589977	4595818	If you do not own a Wii and you own a PS3, you will be able to purchase it on the PlayStation Network on the 25th.
4596558	4600179	And if you want it on the 360, well, you're going to have to wait until October 1st.
4601699	4604561	It will be available soon, and that's awesome.
4605341	4610965	Another thing that will be available shortly after all that comes out is some download content for Mega Man 9.
4611705	4615568	The first new playable character they're going to include is Proto Man.
4616888	4618930	You're going to actually be able to use him.
4619330	4628195	Some of the stuff that you get, like the Rush Adapters, actually change to Proto Adapters in the game, including the Proto Sled, Proto Coil, etc.
4629076	4630256	I guess it's all just kind of...
4631477	4635760	I'm sorry, it's just crazy that there's download content for like an old school Nintendo game in a way.
4635820	4636581	It's just kind of cool.
4636781	4637301	I don't know why.
4637361	4638182	It's just really, really cool.
4639043	4639223	Yes.
4639703	4646048	So that'll be available on October 6th for two bucks or the equivalent thereof.
4646288	4653013	And by the way, even though we can't play the entire Mega Man 9 soundtrack or so on the live show, we can play a little clip.
4653353	4654854	So here's what some of the music sounds like.
4654914	4657016	Here's a clip from Tornado Man's stage.
4665550	4671031	So you can see it has all that same retro goodness of the old school of Mega Man games, like you knew it was going to have.
4671351	4671731	Yeah.
4671811	4672211	Very cool.
4672371	4685874	And some other cool stuff, if you happen to be all nostalgic and love playing Mega Man 9, well, I don't know if you remember that fake, well, I guess old school box art they had going out for Mega Man 9.
4686634	4688815	The really human face for Mega Man.
4688835	4689975	That was scary.
4690676	4704341	You now can actually purchase the fake box, a fake NES cart, and I guess it may come with the Asset CD that they were handing out before because these were for press release stuff.
4704641	4706722	They had screenshots and all sorts of stuff.
4707142	4714885	But they are available on the Capcom store, so you can find those at capcom-unity.com and
4715965	4717687	They will be exceedingly rare.
4718467	4724473	So if you're interested in getting it, you might want to put an order in as soon as possible.
4725214	4725714	It's kind of neat.
4726515	4728757	Yeah, how much do you think those things will start going for on eBay?
4728897	4729458	Who knows?
4730579	4731480	Quite a bit, I'd imagine.
4733442	4735103	Anyone in here planning to get that game this week?
4736465	4736725	Yes.
4737085	4737926	I think we're going to.
4739338	4745160	Jamie, of course, having a little trouble with her voice tonight because of the allergies, but I think she just said they think they're going to get it this week.
4745500	4753903	I want to because I think the D-pad on the Wii is pretty awesome, whereas the D-pad on the 360, not so awesome.
4754023	4757744	However, I love achievement points, so therefore I will be getting none of that, too.
4758089	4761851	Yeah, I think I'm going to be holding off on the 360 version, even though the controller bugs the crap out of me.
4761891	4768275	I'm kind of hoping that's one of the things Microsoft's going to fix in 09, based on what we saw at the Leipzig show.
4769075	4769695	At least I'm hoping.
4770316	4770636	We'll see.
4771757	4776059	Anyhow, other games and other big franchises that people are really excited about.
4776139	4776839	Suikoden!
4776879	4778420	I know we've got a few Suikoden fans in the house.
4778780	4780902	A brand new Suikoden game was announced for DS.
4780962	4786765	It's not a numbered Suikoden game, but a new game called Suikoden Tyrkriz is the new game that's coming out.
4787185	4788706	and this is kind of neat.
4788746	4798114	What's kind of cool about this game, again, the big niche of the Suikoden series, you could say, is that it's a classic JRPG, but you have 108 characters in it.
4798134	4800516	There's just tons and tons and tons of characters.
4800576	4806842	What's kind of cool about this one is that with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection now, you can actually play...
4807262	4833677	where you're leveling one of the 108 people but somebody else can level the other characters so you can kind of like all kind of participate in leveling up the different characters so it provides a new way to level up characters and creates a little bit of a community and apparently when they say Nintendo Wi-Fi connection they are talking the internet not just a local Wi-Fi connection so that could be very interesting I'm kind of curious to see how this plays out so more information to come on that
4834217	4838439	Apparently, this was shown at a Konami event that we weren't invited to this year.
4839259	4839479	Sad.
4839659	4840580	But I heard it was in New York.
4840640	4841260	That's probably why.
4841940	4842340	Yeah.
4842561	4843401	Probably wasn't on our coast.
4843421	4844201	I'm sure it was.
4844741	4845022	Oh, well.
4845362	4848823	You know, they couldn't fly us out there, even though they flew everybody else out there.
4848883	4849243	Oh, well.
4849263	4850864	Not that we're going to be bitter much.
4850884	4852305	But we can't really tell you much more about the game.
4852385	4853325	Oh, darn.
4853425	4856826	I couldn't play Rock Revolution, maybe have a positive impression of it.
4856866	4859047	Do you think maybe that's why you didn't get an invite?
4859067	4860628	Well, no, I don't think so.
4861348	4861989	But hey, you know what?
4862049	4863831	If a game stinks, we're not going to hold back at the same time.
4863871	4868177	It's more important we have integrity than, you know... I could have... But see, that's the thing.
4868317	4872363	I'm only taking it based off of, you know, screenshots and stuff.
4872383	4873404	That's not very accurate.
4873484	4877670	And with, you know, outplaying it, I can't really give you my true impression, but...
4878902	4891517	whatever, who cares, it's not important so anyway, Suikoden looks interesting though I've missed out on some of the more recent Suikoden games, but I did enjoy the ones on Playstation 1, so I might have a reason to check it out, I think the online component sounds neat
4892754	4898778	So, Peter Molyneux, he actually, of course, has this little game coming out called Fable 2.
4899879	4909705	And you may remember there were some games released on Xbox Live Arcade called the Fable 2 Pub Games, where you can earn gold to use in the actual game.
4910346	4916790	Well, of course, people found exploits and glitches to be able to make a lot of money really quick.
4917490	4926798	and according to Peter Molyneux, that was intentional in that they're going to be in for a surprise when they actually start the game.
4927258	4932282	And of course now there's a patch being put out that fixes that and all that stuff.
4932683	4936666	Somehow I think he's full of shit, to be honest, and I don't think it was intentional.
4937366	4942531	And I think maybe if you try it with this new patch, it will do trigger something, but I think...
4943291	4952580	If you're doing it, and besides, you can also clear out your hard drive cache or whatever and erase these updates and cheat anyways, I don't think it's going to matter.
4953020	4954662	I'm kind of curious to see what happens.
4955182	4963290	I do claim bullshit on the fact that it was premeditated, but I think there is some legitimacy to the fact that something will happen in the game if you cheat it.
4963330	4964231	I think they will be able to
4964671	4965632	Thanks for watching!
4979761	4981122	I'm not saying something about the game.
4981243	4987089	I'm saying that the Xbox Live Arcade game is going to have to be patched in order for it to be able to detect the cheating.
4987529	4998300	Because I think that you're going to try it, and if you try the same technique to cheat now, now that they have it patched in, that it's going to raise a flag or something that's going to cause it to trigger in the game.
4998400	5000402	If you're that worried about it, just flush your...
5001483	5004844	Your Fable 2 pub games file and flush your hard drive.
5004924	5007025	Exactly, just do it offline.
5007165	5009626	And the patch is actually already live, according to Zushi.
5009666	5010827	Yeah, it is already live.
5010847	5014408	I haven't actually played the pub games yet, even though I got them.
5014428	5017990	Yeah, I played them for like five minutes.
5018090	5021611	One of them is just basically a fancy slot machine, which brings nothing new to the table.
5022091	5024512	The other one is kind of like a weird version of roulette.
5024812	5028674	The Pyramid game was interesting, but it didn't hold my attention for long enough.
5029594	5029934	Honestly.
5031275	5036657	I think a lot of people were just getting it to exploit the hell out of it for when the game actually comes out, but I don't know.
5036677	5037738	What do you guys think in chat?
5037758	5041920	Do you think it was intentional the whole time that they intended to have an exploit in there?
5042300	5046682	I mean, it does definitely kind of tie into the whole good versus evil thing that Fable has, but I think it's crap.
5047162	5055646	He likes to sound like a smarty pants and just, you know, trying to, oh, I did all this stuff because I think outside the box, I think greater than loss.
5055766	5057166	I don't think he thought anything.
5057206	5058047	I think it's just a glitch.
5058608	5062658	That now they're patching in some sort of repercussion if you try it.
5063661	5064723	So, whatever.
5065646	5066648	Big freaking whoop.
5067788	5073352	Who knows if we'll get a new Fable game next year, but one game we'll probably get next year is a brand new James Bond game.
5073692	5077794	That's right, Activision has said that they are planning to put out yearly Bond games.
5077854	5083078	Even though the movies only seem to come out every other year, they're going to actually be trying to crank out yearly Bond titles.
5083338	5085860	Of course, right now the game they're trying to put out is Quantum of Solace.
5085900	5091203	It's actually based on the Call of Duty 4 engine, and obviously the movie tie-in they've got this year.
5091363	5091904	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5110320	5111702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5131344	5133965	Not that they've been wonderful, but who knows?
5134425	5135045	We'll see what happens.
5135426	5138006	Anyway, just really quickly, I wanted to go over some of the responses.
5138146	5140847	Was the pub games intentional or not?
5142088	5144349	James Patrick says, Peter M isn't a typical guy.
5144469	5147510	I think it could very well be intentional.
5147570	5151151	GameGuru says, they should keep the cheat in, but have it make you more evil.
5151491	5153592	So that, yeah, you can cheat, but it's an evil act.
5154032	5154632	Oh, interesting.
5155253	5156413	So, we'll see what happens.
5158494	5158614	So...
5160179	5163080	if you want to comment on our stories chat.orangeloungeradio.com
5164249	5165029	We want comments.
5165749	5171431	Well, this actually is good news for our European listeners, or anybody listening or not, but we hope you're listening.
5172551	5176012	Actually, the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut on the 19th of September.
5177132	5178052	The 360 Arcade is going to £129.
5178092	5181513	The 60GB Pro is going to £169, and the 120GB Elite is to £29.
5181553	5181833	So, good news.
5194256	5195679	Yay, cheaper things!
5196440	5201869	And I'm glad, you know, because Europe sometimes gets the shaft in a lot of our news stories, so it's nice to hear them getting a break once in a while.
5202290	5206457	It's just too bad they didn't get it the same time we did, but hey, better late than never, right?
5207058	5207218	Yeah.
5208258	5218584	There's a big old rumor coming out about Project Gotham 5, saying now that it's being developed by the Forza development team, and that there could be an announcement for it next week.
5219224	5226548	According to a website called Addict Gaming, they have a reliable source saying,
5227569	5228230	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5244702	5245583	and DarkSakura.
5263120	5268521	Heaven forbid, Microsoft and G4 could have been lying to us and it's actually going to happen.
5269321	5271261	But, you know, once again, we'll see you next week.
5271741	5272202	You know what?
5272482	5282083	Don't you think, I don't know, if I were G4 Television and I had a big exclusive thing that I was going to be dedicating, you know, five hours of programming to, don't you think I would have started advertising it like six weeks ago?
5282543	5289845	No, because if they want to be a surprise, and this was the agreement with Microsoft to keep it hush-hush super secret until the very end, you know.
5289925	5291085	What's the point of a surprise?
5291205	5292005	I don't know.
5292265	5292585	I don't.
5293045	5294765	I'm just saying it's bullshit, that's all.
5315630	5317311	and that there's an announcement coming soon.
5317391	5319372	Maybe this announcement could come at the same time.
5319452	5324414	Just saying there's kind of smoke here that they're maybe going to announce something soon about something.
5324554	5329917	So I still don't believe they're going to do a five-hour long thing on G4, but who knows?
5330037	5332778	Maybe there's something somewhere in the middle ground that's coming.
5333178	5337080	Just saying because, you know, all those Microsoft rumors, you know, they always seem to come true somehow.
5337660	5338801	So I don't know.
5339827	5341872	Well, some people are very excited about this rumor.
5341993	5346023	Actdeft in chat says, Project Gotham Racing 5, developed by the Forza team, do want...
5347389	5350270	I'm not as into the Project Gotham and Forza games as much as I am the more simple ones.
5370760	5372100	Racing games, so to speak.
5372120	5382302	You know, I'm not, like, super into cars, but I like the more Need for Speed, Burnout-type games, but I love dumb, simple, like, dumb, dumb, dumb, simple racing games like F-Zero and Mario Kart.
5382662	5388003	And I would love it if they would make a next-gen, like, dumb racing game that's like F-Zero.
5388103	5389643	I really want, like, a next-gen F-Zero game.
5389683	5390184	Can't you tell?
5390444	5391804	How many times have I said it on the show?
5393244	5396905	I wish that would be what they'd announce at Nintendo's press events coming up.
5396925	5397745	Wouldn't that be nice?
5398803	5399344	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5414540	5416120	and some new download content that's coming out.
5416180	5417481	It's called the 8-Ball Pack.
5417521	5418681	It's supposed to be coming out this fall.
5418901	5423562	There's going to be two brand new multiplayer things and eight new cars, hence the name of the 8-Ball Pack.
5424022	5430843	A McLaren F1 GTR, a Honda S2000, a 1971 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am are some of the new things you can look for.
5431523	5434504	The expansion will be released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
5435144	5442305	It's going to also bring some new achievements thanks to four new achievements, 100 gamers score, of course on the PlayStation 3, that would be trophies.
5443265	5458171	so there's also going to be some new multiplayer events as well it's pretty cool not quite specific on what the price is going to be for this or what the exact release date is but just plan on it soon as in this fall if you're a grid player
5458971	5464796	Well, something else that's coming soon is the PlayStation firmware 2.5.
5465716	5469019	That's going to be likely later October.
5469839	5474203	And supposedly, simultaneously with that, it will be the release of Home 1.0.
5476064	5505554	so finally the beta will be over and you'll actually well the beta won't necessarily be over but you'll actually be able to participate in it and it says they're waiting for a system software update to the PS3 to deal with this I guess some sporadic network issues that they have with home right now and then they're going to reopen it sometime I guess this week for thousands of new testers but in October is when they're supposed to bite the bullet and actually
5507040	5509903	launch this thing they've been teasing for a long time now.
5513667	5518511	Wouldn't it be funny if they just came out in October and go, uh, yeah, it's coming out spring of 2009.
5519792	5520313	I'd laugh.
5520453	5523456	No, haven't they, like, guaranteed that it's coming out this year?
5523476	5524277	It doesn't matter.
5524317	5530663	They guaranteed that the PlayStation 3 was coming out in the spring and ended up getting delayed to the fall, so nothing's guaranteed.
5531143	5531544	Fair enough.
5532867	5535409	I... Are you looking forward to trying out Home?
5535650	5536450	No, I don't really care.
5536550	5537211	You don't really care?
5537591	5538292	I'll test it out.
5538312	5540014	I'm excited about Home.
5540534	5542356	I honestly don't think it's going to be that great.
5542436	5543617	I think it's just going to be kind of eh.
5544478	5545439	Look at what we can do.
5545499	5546079	We're different.
5546159	5546780	I mean, great.
5546840	5551064	It's a way to differentiate themselves, but we'll see how they actually use it.
5551084	5552385	Alright.
5552405	5552605	Alright.
5553379	5555620	Well, hey, you know what's kind of funny we're talking about?
5555640	5562261	We're just joking around in chat right now, and people were talking about racing games, and Alpha Cananogram said there is a next-gen racing game.
5562301	5565362	It's called Crazy Woman Driver, also known as Excite Truck.
5565682	5568202	And I was kind of like, they should make a game called Crazy Woman Driver.
5568663	5570263	But it should be like, not really.
5570303	5571783	I'm not trying to say that with malice.
5571903	5578185	Obviously, I don't think all women are crazy drivers, but I think there should be a game based around crazy women driving.
5579165	5581288	So then we get the sequel, Small Penis Trucking?
5582249	5582630	Sure!
5583070	5584032	Sure, fine by me.
5584072	5585413	We can have Small Penis Trucking.
5585493	5585894	Fair enough.
5585914	5586555	Fair is fair.
5586975	5587676	We can have both.
5588177	5590540	Or how about this?
5591261	5593904	Great Big Rims, Itty Bitty Penis.
5594974	5595815	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5624676	5625877	I mean, how can you forget her, right?
5625917	5633662	She was the one on YouTube that her boyfriend taped her doing the whole hula hooping thing and obviously showing off her assets.
5634222	5635383	And it was very controversial.
5635663	5637965	Well, Tyra Banks had that couple on the show.
5638525	5645650	And apparently, Tyra helped this girl kind of get her revenge on the guy.
5646170	5652675	And the guy was actually... The boyfriend was on the show playing and he actually...
5653587	5654568	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5683800	5690227	The only time I ever hear about the Tyra Banks show is when I'm watching the soup because they make fun of her because she's retarded.
5691489	5691869	I don't know.
5692890	5699217	She did something way back with World of Warcraft where they destroyed some dude's CDs or something like that.
5699497	5701640	Yeah, you installed the game, you dipshit.
5704477	5718146	I actually walked by at work and I saw that Tyra was on because they have a TV at work and they have different channels on during the day and I saw that the Tyra Banks show was on and I actually kind of looked up and I noticed they were showing the YouTube of the Wii Fit girl.
5718186	5722128	She was getting ready to introduce her and I was kind of looking at it going, this must be a rerun.
5722148	5723309	This is like 90 days old.
5724650	5725350	No, it wasn't.
5725490	5727372	It was a brand new episode.
5728312	5729173	Too little, too late.
5729673	5730413	Too little, too late.
5730753	5735816	So, you know, late stories, I don't know about you guys, but they make me a little bit angsty.
5736196	5738537	So this is when we get into the FUs of the week.
5754244	5761928	My idea of the week goes towards my sinuses, my allergies, my lungs, and lots and lots of mucus.
5762249	5763329	I miss having a voice.
5763789	5767932	I hate having to eat or drink something hot just to be perfectly audible.
5768652	5775816	And, um, Rob... That's the only cool part of it.
5775836	5776537	Old joke is old.
5777357	5779218	Alright, Loki.
5780519	5780679	Um...
5781385	5787671	I guess my FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm going to have to wake up early tomorrow because I have to take my wife's car in.
5788191	5798280	Apparently she was driving down the street or whatever, doing 50 or something, and then the car all of a sudden stopped accelerating and the check engine light came on.
5798300	5801803	Then it started accelerating again, so that's usually not a good thing.
5803344	5805406	So yeah, I hate waking up early.
5807606	5814074	Um, my FU of the week goes to something I've been spending a lot of time on lately, and my FU of the week goes to Proposition 8.
5814695	5824125	I don't usually get very politically motivated on the show, but seeing as this is something that directly affects my rights, and, you know, we've done this show for free for how long?
5824226	5825968	Pardon me while I get on my soapbox for a minute.
5826648	5832930	If you live in California, even if you don't live in California, please tell people that you know that live in California to vote no on Proposition 8.
5833270	5842554	Proposition 8 is basically an initiative on the ballot that's looking to ban same-sex marriage, which is already legal in California, thanks to a court decision a few months ago.
5843854	5845995	I believe in equality and fairness for all.
5846475	5856903	And, you know, despite however a person might feel about gay marriage personally, it's not going to hurt you if two guys or two women get married and, you know, go on with their lives and raise a family.
5857023	5866811	And I think it's just, I think the whole thing is so stupid and I can't believe that people pour millions and millions of dollars into what I basically see as, in this opinion, hate.
5867852	5871134	When I see people donating money to this YesOn8 campaign, I see hate.
5871655	5872355	Because that's what it is.
5872375	5874297	It's discrimination of the 21st century and it stinks.
5875458	5876460	It's also ignorance.
5876480	5877522	It's just ignorance.
5877683	5878184	It's ignorant!
5878424	5878645	I mean...
5880413	5881714	I know, I know, I could go on for days.
5881854	5883315	No, no, I fully agree with you.
5883375	5884356	It's absolutely disgusting.
5884416	5888838	I mean, honestly, I would love to see marriage made illegal to begin with.
5890019	5890739	No, no, no.
5890759	5891100	I understand.
5891140	5896923	Marriage be strictly reduced to a religious institution.
5897344	5898885	Separation of church and state.
5898985	5902347	Have that wall that Jefferson intended when he wrote the damn phrase.
5903267	5903648	Right.
5904268	5905829	And have the government should...
5906349	5907029	Thanks for watching!
5925957	5930262	and, you know, it's very, very important that we defeat Proposition 8 on the ballot.
5930302	5932004	It pisses me off that they lie.
5932305	5933146	They freaking lie.
5933166	5939513	When they call people, they say that if this proposition is defeated, the churches are going to be forced to marry.
5939593	5942457	That Mormon churches and churches that don't want to do it are going to be forced to marry.
5942677	5943438	That is not true.
5943458	5944359	Churches are private organizations.
5944419	5945461	It's straight up not true.
5945561	5957977	Well, it's like, the Catholic Church, actually, they're very strict in who they can and can't marry, because they both have to be Catholic, as far as I'm aware, and all this other stuff is... No, you're absolutely right.
5958037	5960400	I think it's stupid and ridiculous.
5961200	5962781	We should dedicate a podcast just to it.
5962961	5963421	Oh, God.
5963741	5964981	I could just go on for days and days and days.
5965061	5965842	Anyway, you know what?
5965922	5972043	For those folks that think that gay marriage is going to ruin the sanctity of marriage, I've got three words for you.
5972524	5973744	Britney fucking Spears.
5975885	5976125	All right.
5976165	5976905	Back to video games.
5977265	5977985	Hug, hug, kiss, kiss.
5978685	5979226	I love everybody.
5979666	5979966	I really do.
5979986	5980766	You're so zilly.
5980786	5981526	All right.
5982046	5983087	Britney fucking Spears.
5983107	5983527	That's awesome.
5985051	5985732	You know what?
5985992	5986232	What?
5986592	5986913	Nothing.
5988274	5989095	That's another podcast.
5989295	5991137	We need to do a political podcast someday.
5991217	5999824	You know, I actually, actually, and I will go ahead and say this on the air, you know, because you know me, I'm very opinionated about my libertarian ideas.
5999964	6000225	You?
6000945	6001646	Opinionated?
6001666	6001706	No.
6001726	6002327	Rob.
6002367	6002487	What?
6004844	6005945	All right, I'm just messing.
6006225	6011807	But maybe we should do some type of a new sub-podcast, a political cast.
6011827	6015048	We should do something called, I don't know if Loki's down with it.
6015489	6016609	Two pissed off nerds.
6016629	6017690	That's what we should call the show.
6017710	6018290	Two pissed off nerds.
6018310	6018830	I joined the ECA.
6019210	6019430	Huh?
6019631	6020551	I joined the ECA.
6021291	6021791	Yeah, there you go.
6021811	6023412	So we get lots of information from them.
6023472	6023952	Why not?
6024253	6024713	Maybe.
6025053	6028755	You know, it's about time people put their foot down and said, screw you guys.
6028955	6029695	I'm going that way.
6029915	6034556	No, and I'm pissed off that Comcast is limiting my bandwidth to 250 gigabytes a month.
6034656	6035116	You know what?
6035156	6036777	That is something else to get pissed off about.
6036797	6040218	It's a different political thing, but yeah, that is angry.
6041118	6041758	I like that idea.
6041798	6042558	Two pissed off nerds.
6042578	6043578	Let's see if there's already a podcast.
6043598	6044139	There's got to be.
6044419	6046639	I'm sure there's one called Angry Nerds or something.
6046699	6051580	They basically say that's 62,500 songs at 4 megabytes per song.
6051801	6054941	That's basically 125 standard definition movies.
6055341	6055902	Well, you know what?
6056142	6057282	I download that much.
6058883	6059503	Actually, I don't.
6059763	6064305	But I do monitor my downloading now.
6064385	6065526	GS68 says, pissed off nerds.
6065566	6066806	Wouldn't that be Under Sedation Live?
6067106	6067706	That's a good point.
6067726	6069067	They might already have a corner on that market.
6069087	6072408	They also have the angry video game nerd who's kind of retarded.
6072488	6073409	But he's awesome.
6073429	6076510	That's different, though, because that's actually about video games.
6076630	6081992	And he plays the games and talks shit about them, and they usually are shitty games.
6082998	6085700	I'm, you know what, I'm not going to state my opinion on the show.
6085720	6088021	He was the angry Nintendo nerd and he became the angry video game nerd.
6088121	6090743	I'm a fan of independent productions, we'll just leave it at that.
6090763	6091964	Rob, let's do it.
6092744	6093545	We'll look into it.
6093585	6094946	When do Twin Powers activate?
6095126	6096006	Form of a bucket.
6096026	6097027	We'll explore the possibilities.
6097067	6097647	Alright, video games!
6098128	6098388	Damn it.
6098968	6103051	Guess what's coming out on Virtual Console overseas?
6104352	6107974	They're getting the Master System Sonic the Hedgehog.
6109363	6112085	Commodore 64, Rob, Boulder Dash Jumpman
6131291	6132952	Jumpman Jr.
6132972	6136753	was the first game I ever owned on my Commodore 64.
6136833	6141714	Well, Jumpman, if I'm right, this is the Jumpman that led to us getting Donkey Kong.
6143035	6143355	Wasn't it?
6143415	6144255	In a way, yeah.
6144295	6146216	It's very similar the way they were laid out.
6146396	6151358	But the first hero in Donkey Kong was called Jumpman before he became Mario.
6151898	6152198	Remember?
6152802	6153302	Mouse Trap, didn't they?
6179032	6180593	Uh... Yeah, they did Mousetrap.
6180653	6181073	I love that game.
6181093	6184216	They did, but I thought Epix did Jump... But they did Jumpman Jr.
6184416	6185037	It is Epix.
6185097	6187119	I was reading it wrong because I'm dead.
6187299	6189120	Epix did, like, summer games and winter games.
6189140	6192443	They did a lot of great, great... Epix did a lot of games on Clicovision.
6193344	6193464	Oh.
6194805	6196627	That's what I played it on, was the Clicovision.
6197187	6197468	Yeah.
6197768	6200771	I gotta play a little bit here of just some of the stuff from Jumpman Jr.,
6205089	6208432	I know it's Jumpman Jr., not Jumpman, but it's the same freaking thing.
6210874	6213857	I remember setting it up to go really fast, and it was funny.
6214357	6216179	Yeah, you can set your speed in this game.
6216219	6220903	That was the amazing thing about it, is that, like, you could have the speed be so freaking fast, it was, like, unreal.
6223946	6225127	So where's some actual gameplay noise?
6226630	6227270	I love that game.
6227470	6228611	Oh, this game was so amazing.
6229571	6229892	Sorry.
6230472	6232973	We're living in our little retro world.
6233313	6234934	Yes, you have to avoid that killer dot.
6237435	6237815	Anyway, sorry.
6237995	6238176	Okay.
6238396	6239076	We're done reminiscing.
6239596	6240176	I love that game.
6241237	6241477	Me too.
6241977	6242778	I don't know.
6242818	6244419	That was a good virtual console update.
6245699	6248460	Well, it's not fair that they get it there and we don't get it.
6248601	6248921	I know.
6248981	6250201	Even though I'm on my little boycott.
6250281	6252262	I might break my boycott for Jumpman, honestly.
6253363	6253863	That's awesome.
6254803	6255864	I think that we will, though.
6256331	6257391	You know, I think.
6288556	6289897	Anyhow, only us.
6290237	6294561	We can only make that transition from virtual console to porn.
6295442	6298944	Anyways, so... From jacking off to PlayStation 3 news.
6298964	6301547	Yeah, exactly.
6303008	6305550	Oh, Sony, how you make the funnies.
6305970	6314137	I seriously wonder if they're trying this on purpose now, but apparently the Sony PlayStation 3 just launched into the Malaysia region.
6315059	6320418	and during their little party that they were talking about
6321772	6322613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6351943	6353044	How did they not catch that?
6354825	6356546	I don't know.
6356586	6358568	Did someone just get the wrong CD in the mixer, maybe?
6359688	6361149	That's a really wrong CD.
6361169	6364792	That's something that shouldn't have even been in the building, right?
6365492	6366033	Exactly.
6367073	6367934	So that was kind of funny.
6368154	6370075	They have the video on YouTube.
6370095	6372117	Definitely check it out because it's pretty funny.
6374639	6375239	That is it.
6376229	6380050	And of course, Kotaku ran the story, or one of the stories.
6380810	6382811	Even the Imperial Marshal would have been a better choice.
6385092	6385492	Alright.
6386632	6390733	Well, every week on this program, we like to give you a chance to give us some feedback.
6390813	6396135	Not just through the chat room at chat.orange.com or the phone calls, which we'll get to later, but through our mailbag.
6396175	6402897	And every week you guys send us emails, and we pick a few of them to read on the show, or in tonight's case, we're probably going to read a lot of them on the show tonight, actually.
6404157	6405718	It's a segment we call the OLR Mailbag.
6407881	6409382	Thank you for watching!
6435222	6435462	Robway
6450799	6453500	Interesting theory, but would Kingdom Hearts be on the 360?
6453840	6454841	I don't think so.
6454901	6457322	An Infinite Discovery, I think, is a 360 exclusive.
6457682	6459843	But it would be a killer exclusive.
6459943	6464384	But I think most people have kind of already chalked up the fact that, and the rumors are saying that Kingdom Hearts is going to be on the 360.
6464984	6470607	But if you remember, they develop all their games on PC, so it wouldn't matter anyways.
6470627	6470927	True.
6471127	6472327	So, yeah, absolutely.
6472347	6475068	It could be a cross-platform thing, but just something to think about.
6475328	6476529	By the way, he also wants to add a PS3.
6477949	6482391	If you haven't yet played the game, early on in the game is a village called New Land.
6482671	6483811	This is spoiler free, don't worry.
6484211	6489893	In order to ensure you don't have to restart the game, save the game as soon as you find the save point.
6490253	6493874	Do not overwrite that save until you have completed the task there.
6494555	6498116	A tip from Rob with two Bs that might save some of you guys some headaches.
6499666	6500907	We have another question here.
6501508	6509474	This individual did not sign their email, but I think it's Spazinator, because I see it in the email address, even though I'm not going to give the whole email address, but we'll just say that.
6509995	6511456	Hi folks, I have some questions for you again.
6511476	6514799	I hope you don't mind that most of them are of a semi-quasi-political in nature.
6514859	6515559	Hey, no, that's okay.
6515579	6517261	We're kind of on a political tangent tonight.
6518181	6523526	One, given that we're experiencing all this economic turmoil, do you see this affecting the video game industry in any way, shape, or form?
6525034	6525615	What do you guys think?
6525735	6529317	Would the current economy situation affect the video game industry?
6530158	6534882	Well, it's a lot of banks that are going poor, so it's not like... I mean, people...
6536215	6536755	Thanks for watching!
6557543	6561105	In my opinion, and this is not the dumbest answer, in some ways yes, in some ways no.
6562045	6566467	Yes, because people have less disposable income and video games are funded by disposable income.
6566847	6570589	But no, because video games are a global market, not just made for the U.S.
6570909	6577812	So I don't think they're necessarily going to stop developing games because they still sell in Japan, they still sell in Europe and other countries and they might not be experiencing the same thing we're experiencing.
6577892	6579133	So, something to think about.
6580013	6593550	Number two, with the election coming up not too long from now and given the fact that both Obama and McCain are in a virtual tie currently in polls, do you think either one of them will reach out to gamers, seeing as a good chunk of the population are gamers, most of which are old enough to vote?
6594591	6595913	Honestly, you want my honest answer?
6596253	6596393	No.
6597034	6597535	Jack Voldemort
6612131	6620036	and people that, you know, video games are bad and bloody and violent and, you know, it's that old mentality that Dungeons and Dragons makes people kill people in real life.
6620477	6621757	Unfortunately, that's still around.
6622138	6630783	So, unfortunately, I don't think you're ever going to see Obama and McCain siding with the gamers in that respect because I think it would, for them, sadly, would do more harm than good.
6631704	6643505	And it's sad, don't get me wrong, but that's why it's important that gamers, you know, that's why things like ECA and so on are important because gamers get a voice, then gamers get their political clout known, etc., etc.,
6645311	6650752	This one isn't so much a question, back to the email, as it is a random idea or a thought I had and would like to have you guys be my sounding board.
6651052	6657454	Do you think it may be a decent idea if sometime down the road there was a political post, either on a volunteer basis or salaried, that had two functions?
6657794	6662555	Advise the president on all things video game entertainment related and also did some public education on video games.
6662875	6667676	Basically dispelling myths, misconceptions, stereotypes, and anything Jack Douchebag says about video games.
6668116	6672257	I was thinking that if something like this was in place, perhaps things will eventually simmer down.
6673378	6674499	Something like it is in place.
6674559	6675519	It's called the ECA.
6676100	6678222	It's just not officially government sanctioned.
6678302	6681824	But you're on the right track with what you're thinking about.
6681864	6687229	But again, for the same reasons I stated before, you're not going to see the government just start to embrace video games like that.
6687509	6687989	You know what I mean?
6688830	6694715	But I think what you're talking about, that's the type of thing that the ECA is looking to bring awareness to.
6695155	6699278	So check it out if you haven't already because I think they're looking for politically minded people like you.
6700559	6700800	Agree?
6700900	6701240	Disagree?
6704038	6704278	All right.
6704458	6705299	That was an I think so.
6705459	6705739	All right.
6707180	6708621	Moving on to the next email.
6708761	6711783	This is from IMAB.
6713224	6713885	Hi, OLR.
6714005	6717527	I was wondering if you guys are still going to do Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
6717868	6718808	And if so, when is it?
6719149	6722051	Anyways, keep up the great work, and I hope to see you guys in future cons.
6722311	6723812	You know, I'm afraid we may have missed it.
6724232	6725393	I forgot completely about it.
6725533	6726254	We haven't missed it yet.
6726274	6727094	The game hasn't come out yet.
6727134	6727635	It's moved.
6728135	6730457	But I thought it was supposed to be the day after Silent Hill 2's release.
6731751	6736692	No, I think we were doing, just to make it easy, the release of Silent Hill Homecoming.
6736712	6738433	Doesn't Homecoming come out in like two weeks?
6738993	6739853	Yeah, it's on the 30th.
6740193	6746455	See, I always thought, oh, it's almost around that same time anyway, because September 25th, so that would be like in four days.
6746775	6746915	Is it?
6746935	6749195	Yeah, it's like the day, no, I'm sorry, September 24th.
6749275	6750075	25th would be the Wednesday.
6750476	6753756	September 24th was the day that it was originally released on the PlayStation 2 in 2001.
6753816	6758637	Actually, 25th would be, yeah, just do it on the 30th, it makes it easy.
6759898	6760598	Or for Halloween.
6761397	6762258	Play a Silent Hill game.
6776947	6782352	Play a Silent Hill game like Silent Hill 2 that's really good, and then wait for our review after the game comes out.
6782472	6785754	And if it's good, you'll buy that too, and that's how you can praise Pyramid Head.
6786035	6795743	But if you do want to take little pictures of Pyramid Heads and send them in to us, or creative Pyramid Head usage in public, then I would love to run them on the front page of our site.
6795803	6796423	I think that would be fun.
6797904	6800847	So maybe just kind of like a general end of September review.
6801936	6806600	And I don't know about having a rape appreciation day, if people would like that too much.
6807021	6808702	But it's only rape of monsters, remember.
6809623	6810564	Not rape of humans.
6811525	6811845	Alright.
6813627	6815528	Let's go on to another email.
6817830	6820252	That comes from... Let's see...
6822381	6822982	It's not signed.
6823022	6823482	Oh, yes it is.
6823803	6824283	Geekboy2424.
6824363	6826245	Woohoo!
6826285	6827947	I finally got an Xbox 360.
6828067	6829229	OMG, it is so awesome.
6829269	6831772	You can't even imagine the happy vibes coming off me right now.
6832132	6833634	Anyway, what are your guys' gamer tags?
6833674	6835916	I'll add you on live if you have any space on your friends list.
6836277	6837378	My gamer tag is Geekboy2424.
6837418	6839320	See you guys on live.
6839660	6842584	This email is brought to you by me, home of the endless amounts of happiness.
6843464	6845406	Check out the forums in the Oil Army thread.
6845446	6847727	There's a whole thread where we're exchanging gamer tags.
6848128	6861397	Sadly, my friends list is full, but if you send me a really nice message, I'll usually try to find somebody on there who hasn't signed into Xbox Live in like 30 days and delete them to make room for new listeners or just somebody who I've never exchanged a message with or anything.
6861817	6864579	So yeah, send me a message if you want.
6864979	6867861	But instead of giving you the gamer tags out over the air, we're going to make it work for it.
6868342	6870043	So head on over to the forums and check that out.
6871263	6897793	or listen to a previous episode where we did give it out um I think there was one other email I wanted to read here and we're not going to be able to get to all the emails this week but I think we'll read this one and this will be the last one for tonight and it comes to us from Dan Shadow hey guys Dan Shadow here hope you all had a great talk like a pirate day this last Friday I had my fair share of grog I can tell you that hmm talk like a pirate day did you guys do anything to celebrate
6898806	6899807	I said R once.
6900088	6900428	I didn't.
6900669	6901390	R, matey.
6901910	6902972	You acted like one, though.
6903472	6905195	Yeah, I think I posted it on my Twitter.
6905575	6908379	Hey, ZeroDayLeetWares coming to my site.
6908419	6909260	Check it out, dudes.
6910041	6911403	That was my talk like a pirate thing.
6912144	6913365	Um... Some...
6913766	6914266	Thank you for watching!
6940621	6941301	Not necessarily.
6941361	6944522	I think the driving's good in it, and it's not really a crappy game.
6944642	6950444	Now, however, there are crappy minigames that they threw in there, like crappy bowling, crappy darts, and crappy billiards.
6951644	6956185	Yes, that does suck, and that does feel very tacked on and is crappy.
6957306	6957926	But the game itself?
6958166	6958346	Fun.
6960086	6963489	Do you think that it's a crappy shooter and crappy driving game?
6964050	6965592	No, not at all.
6965692	6972158	Having played some of the other multiplayer Grand Theft Auto games, which were only on PSP, unfortunately, they fixed a lot of things.
6972198	6977924	There's a lot of things they haven't fixed, but they each have their own little nuances.
6978344	6980326	My problem with Grand Theft Auto is...
6980967	6981488	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6997387	7003851	I just wonder if the developers are having problems with moving a genre forward without having to distract the gamer with aspects of more popular games.
7004311	7009433	This has worked so far, but I don't want to see RPG elements in every single game, nor do I want to have a driver in my RPG.
7009874	7017237	On the surface, you'll see big-time shooters that are hardcore on the surface, but once you go online, you're riddled with customization, experience points, and guild systems.
7018038	7019639	Where do you think the genres are going?
7019899	7023701	Do you think there's room for more than one great single genre game each year?
7025314	7038001	Yes, but you know what the problem is, I think, and thanks for your email, I think a big part of the problem is that because of the way Christmas is, a lot of games get overlooked because they all come out between September to December.
7038381	7042603	I think more great games will get recognized if they would learn how to evenly space them out throughout the year.
7042623	7044164	They're starting to get that.
7044544	7048966	I think a little bit, yes, but my god, I feel overwhelmed right now with all the games I want to play.
7049106	7049687	I mean, really.
7050687	7068431	The other thing too also is that what they're trying to do is attract more people to their game and the problem is if they keep putting out the same game and not trying to incorporate these little elements that maybe will attract an RPG player or maybe will attract someone who's really into bowling or something.
7070031	7071332	That's really what they're trying to do.
7071372	7073272	They're trying to branch out a little bit.
7073352	7076473	I think the real problem comes down to these companies putting out games that aren't
7077213	7078835	Thanks for watching!
7083442	7083902	Anything.
7084103	7084963	I mean, seriously.
7085103	7086725	Mercenaries 2, what the fuck?
7086765	7087965	That game is not done.
7088025	7092429	There is no way that they can say, oh yeah, we've ironed out all the bugs in that one.
7092529	7093209	No, they did not.
7093369	7104197	In fact, they probably will just look at it, figure out what's wrong with it, and then later on they can go patch it because it made better business sense for them at the time to release it when they did because there wasn't a lot coming out around then.
7104377	7106539	And they figure they're going to get a lot more sales that way.
7106559	7108601	At the same time, people say their game is shit.
7109381	7111982	Interesting comment from Xenocore in our chatroom.
7112282	7115503	The problem is the same reason we all have these big budget games.
7115903	7117703	Too many suits in the industry.
7118744	7121384	I'm kind of curious to see what XNA is going to do to all of this.
7121905	7122725	I keep talking about it.
7122745	7124725	I really think this is going to be a big freaking deal.
7124785	7126966	And I know I make a big deal about it on the show, but come on.
7127446	7131347	I mean, it is a distribution platform for independent games to really get noticed.
7131707	7133788	I'm very curious to see what this does to gaming.
7134594	7135955	If anything, I could be wrong.
7136335	7138237	It could have the impact of just a little pebble.
7138657	7141759	I think if they do anything right, it could be a big volcano, too.
7141799	7149365	And I hate to say this, like the Apple App Store, where a lot of people are putting stuff on there, and it spreads like wildfire really quick.
7149565	7155129	And that's part of the reason why, sorry, Loki, but the iPhone is murdering, is because you don't see that type of...
7156830	7166096	I'm sure some angry emailer who's anti-Apple and pro-Sprint or whatever is going to email me telling me about things I'm not considering.
7166496	7175021	But whatever, Apple's doing a great job marketing their marketplace and getting it out there that any idiot can make these applications.
7175061	7179584	Some of them are very exciting, like the whole built-in Twitter and just everything they've got.
7181074	7181314	Great.
7182055	7186196	So, that's part of why the iPhone's kicking a lot of butt and why everybody really wants one.
7187097	7188297	Well, not everybody, but a lot of people.
7188817	7189818	Alright, that was it for Mailbag.
7189858	7192679	Hey, why don't you send us an email for consideration to be read up next week.
7192719	7196600	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com Very sorry to those emails we didn't get to this week.
7196620	7197921	Just realized we didn't run out of time.
7198181	7201362	But we did read them all and we lulled at your improper grammar.
7201943	7202343	Just kidding.
7202603	7204143	But we also praised you when you had good grammar.
7204904	7205804	Let's get back to some gaming news.
7205864	7206084	Loki.
7206364	7206564	Yes.
7207565	7210106	Well, the big trend now is to release...
7210936	7212216	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7236085	7259078	so we'll have to see if this actually ends up happening because you know like other games like Halo it doesn't end up coming out so yeah I think great let's see if there's a good quality movie made here but unfortunately so far track record hasn't been too favorable I am I do have a little bit of
7260302	7261783	Postal was not good.
7285660	7287380	Far Cry Far Cry Far Cry Far Cry
7311047	7317751	I'm waiting for the fluke to happen where all of a sudden it's just cinematic mastery, but it's not.
7317911	7319132	It's really not going to be good.
7319412	7322394	By the way, TigerClaw reminds me of something I read on the internet this week.
7322634	7325896	He says, oh, speaking of Weibull, he's also coming out with his own video game.
7325916	7326516	Did you hear about that?
7327036	7328277	Yeah, Tunnel Rats.
7329037	7331419	When we interviewed him, he actually talked about that a little bit.
7331639	7333620	I think it's supposed to be coming out next year.
7333840	7335141	They had a trailer for the game.
7336627	7339148	Which looks okay, I guess.
7339328	7342509	It looked kind of boring, but the graphics were alright.
7342710	7349112	Because if ruining one entertainment genre wasn't enough... Or as Actdeft calls him, Uwe Balls.
7350473	7353754	He really just needs to find his niche that he's good at.
7353894	7355235	Obviously, games aren't it.
7356075	7359196	And he just really wants to use games because it's an excuse to make genre films.
7359216	7361097	How about meditating, far away from here?
7361738	7362218	What's his niche?
7362238	7362598	Sucking.
7365011	7370701	Well, he just wants to make genre films, but it's kind of like, oh, I just want to play around with making movies.
7371042	7372765	He's not even really that serious about it.
7372945	7378214	Frisbee suggests in chatroom the wonderfully mature name of Boobway Balls.
7381243	7382064	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7397000	7400481	But you can't help but turn your head and go, I wonder how bad it is.
7400681	7404922	Because we have to warn people, because there are some people that are like, ooh, Far Cry.
7405282	7406902	Ooh, Far Cry, video game movie.
7407402	7417464	You know, sadly enough, the thing is, obviously we can't reach a lot of people, but the people that listen to us can reach their friends, and their friends will reach their friends.
7417864	7424286	And eventually, more of these movies will make it less into the theaters, more direct-to-video, and less people will buy them.
7424986	7431012	because unfortunately these sell like crazy on DVD and I don't know why because people apparently are stupid.
7431052	7432694	Well, people like their bad movie collection.
7433254	7435616	It's MST3K syndrome, right?
7435817	7436337	Exactly.
7436457	7436758	It is.
7437058	7442223	I'm actually wanting to know if any of those riff tracks have been done to an Uwe Boll film because I bet that would be funny.
7443464	7444105	That would be awesome.
7444705	7445146	Moving on.
7446782	7452427	For people who are Sega fans like myself, there are actually going to be a new game coming out.
7453267	7457411	It's Harley-Davidson King of the Road.
7457431	7462896	They did Harley-Davidson and LA Riders not too long ago, like 10 years ago.
7464577	7485155	but now they're going to have it on a full-size Harley on a 62-inch screen and it's going to have a very 70s rock soundtrack with Deep Purple and Steppenwolf and it was on display at the Tokyo Amusement Show.
7486176	7489379	So I want... Awesome.
7490626	7493127	Harley Games Elevator Action Elevator Action
7520208	7520348	Why?
7520388	7520508	Why?
7546676	7547096	I don't know.
7547196	7548277	That's the question of the day.
7548537	7549737	I gotta know.
7550378	7554560	Australian folks, did I just insult you by saying folk?
7554760	7555860	I mean, that's what I want to know.
7556420	7558661	That's what I'm very, very curious about.
7558841	7561062	What is it so insulting about city folk?
7562643	7563383	Folk you, Rob.
7564264	7565024	I don't think that's it.
7566085	7566485	I don't know.
7568446	7571867	The other thing I was going to say, well, I mean, they've done this in the past with other games.
7571907	7576109	I mean, another perfect example would be in the Asian region after
7577097	7581180	is no longer known as Africa, it's known as Hakuna Matata.
7601158	7601919	Disney will sue.
7603160	7605282	Xenocore says it's now known as Jumbo Safari.
7605302	7607905	That's why they're going to sell more copies of it.
7607985	7608445	I wish.
7609226	7609587	I wish.
7610507	7611929	Alright, well one more story for you guys.
7611949	7613430	Then we're going to open up our Skype line.
7613651	7617354	And you can call us at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7619256	7622379	And this is a story about EA, Microsoft, and GameStop.
7622439	7624061	What do these three companies have in common?
7624442	7631909	Well, they were recently awarded perfect scores for the treatment of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender employees.
7632250	7634972	And that's by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.
7635493	7639037	And it's all in the 2009 Corporate Equity Index.
7640157	7648201	Here's a comment on this from GamePolitics.com, a comment from the president of the HRC Foundation, Joel Solmones.
7648962	7661948	The 2009 Corporate Equality Index shows that corporate America understands that a diverse workforce is critical to remaining successful and competitive in the absence of a federal law that prohibits workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression.
7662368	7663029	Thank you for watching!
7683018	7683398	Very nice.
7684778	7688159	You know, it's kind of sad, but you might be thinking, well, why is this news?
7689020	7694241	Because sadly, there are some companies out there where it's okay to discriminate based on that stuff.
7694541	7697182	And it's time to get out of your cave.
7697542	7701463	And really, to be honest, GameStop, they just treat everyone like shit.
7703203	7703963	But at least it's fair.
7703983	7704984	They don't discriminate, though.
7705044	7705784	At least it's fair.
7705925	7707665	Everybody is treated equally.
7707746	7711027	Everybody is treated like shit, so at least it's non-discriminatory.
7711047	7711888	That's the important thing.
7712508	7715109	And I'm fine with that, as long as everybody's treated like shit.
7715670	7724815	All right, anyway, we're going to treat you like shit now when you call us at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7724855	7725295	Just kidding.
7725315	7727796	We won't treat you like shit unless you deserve it.
7728697	7731038	Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, do you have any last-minute stories, Loki?
7732738	7733819	Yes, I do have a few.
7735480	7737962	Some stuff that didn't make our show roll this week.
7739343	7748230	Apparently, there was an ISO loader being in development for the homebrew community, much to the dislike of the homebrew community.
7749291	7752853	And the developer, Wanicoco, apparently...
7754269	7756151	It got leaked out, which is not good.
7756731	7760775	And now the developer said, you ain't getting the full version then, so fuck you all.
7761235	7761556	Yikes.
7761856	7763838	Alright, let's go to the phone real quick and then we'll come back to the story.
7763878	7764738	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
7764758	7765079	Who's this?
7766100	7767021	Yo, what up, guys?
7767081	7768262	It's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.
7768522	7770043	Hey, Xenocore from Ultimate Quest.
7770063	7771044	What is on your mind, my friend?
7772245	7772986	A few things.
7773106	7776909	First of all, duck the new Knight Rider for public safety type thing, you know.
7777070	7777930	Duck it, duck it, duck it.
7778211	7779412	Uh-oh.
7779532	7780713	Did that premiere tonight or something?
7781602	7786123	No, but I caught it on Hulu, and it's like, how many sharks can you jump in one show?
7786243	7788324	My God, are you going for a world record or something?
7788564	7789404	It doesn't even have David Hasselhoff.
7789424	7790205	Somebody call back Hasselhoff.
7790225	7791485	He knows how to do the show.
7792765	7794666	No Hasselhoff equals instant fail.
7794826	7797007	I mean, it doesn't take a genius to recognize that.
7798607	7809751	The only cool thing I liked in there was, even though I disliked the whole mission support type thing going on, the one Asian chick in there that speaks nine languages that's always throwing off one-liners is hilarious.
7809791	7811191	But other than that, that show's garbage.
7811351	7814132	Potential for a good video game out of the new Knight Rider series?
7815232	7815712	Hell no.
7815752	7816532	Too many effects.
7816953	7818973	They put ground effects on Kit for crying out loud.
7819093	7822774	He jumped over guys and there's glowing on the bottom that said KR.
7823134	7825255	It's like, what, this thing run through the hood or something?
7825275	7825955	Get some rims?
7826275	7827456	Did I miss spinning?
7827476	7830837	It's like, good lord, how much crap can you bolt on him?
7831357	7834398	And he transformed into an F-150 of all things.
7834478	7835998	My god, I got so much hate for this show.
7836178	7838719	Alright, well look, I know you didn't call in just to bash on Knight Rider.
7838739	7840119	What's going on here?
7840679	7854644	Actually, from what I've seen of the new Knight Rider show, I thought the little TV movie that they did that kind of piloted the thing, I thought it was pretty good.
7854804	7855824	I mean, I don't know.
7856684	7859225	I did have hope until I saw episode one.
7860685	7862986	Unless the Hoff's involved, I'm not watching it anymore.
7863386	7864907	I know you didn't call in to talk just about Knight Rider.
7864927	7865827	What's on the gaming world?
7867509	7869011	Rob, have you played Warhammer Online yet?
7869192	7869432	I have.
7869492	7870173	I don't know.
7870213	7873059	I think you came into the show late tonight, but I talked about it during my gaming week in Part A.
7874782	7875623	Yeah, I kind of missed that.
7875843	7876824	I was busy with some stuff.
7876904	7877344	No, that's alright.
7877364	7878605	Yeah, I'm liking it so far, man.
7879745	7880266	Do you like it?
7880306	7880926	Now, here's my thing.
7881186	7882587	I had some likes and I had some dislikes.
7882727	7886809	I liked some of the new things that Warhammer brought to the table, especially in the PvP area.
7886929	7889591	I really liked some of the RVR combat that I played.
7889611	7891132	I thought some of the scenarios were pretty awesome.
7891492	7896375	And I liked the idea of the public questing, but I thought the interface was very clunky.
7896535	7897355	I don't know if it's just me.
7897856	7903619	I found the interface to be really clunky, especially compared to some more fluid interfaces that I've used.
7903639	7903819	Well,
7904793	7908915	The interface for me, I actually was able to manage all the information well.
7909075	7914458	I mean, maybe it's because I'm used to looking at cluttered screens, but I saw everything I needed to see in there.
7914478	7915878	I don't need to pull up a disk.
7916058	7921161	It's like if they would have buried it into a window that you have to pull up, nobody would really want to use it.
7921481	7929004	I just put everything up there, just make the colors bright enough to where you can still see the stuff, even though it's just like one or two pixels wide, and it works.
7929645	7932426	And you can still see a lot of the game and have all the information that you need.
7933127	7938949	Plus a lot of the stuff for the interface that they included on the backend, like highlighting quest areas and everything else, I thought was kind of brilliant.
7939749	7947132	Yeah, that's kind of a nice plus, is that it actually kind of shows you where to go for quests, which, you know, you might be thinking, well, it's helping you cheat on the game, but you know what?
7947512	7949153	God, people do that with WoW all the time.
7949173	7953294	You know, they're just looking up online how to beat the quests, so, you know, why not build it into the game a little bit?
7954535	7958496	It's not like people aren't going to tell you specifically where to go or show you on your app.
7958556	7960077	You know, it works in the roleplay sense.
7960997	7961157	Yeah.
7961735	7963256	But orcs are finally done right.
7963356	7965418	This is the way orcs are supposed to be, people.
7965858	7968781	Blizzard stole it from Games Workshop.
7968841	7970382	This is the way they're supposed to be.
7970842	7974465	You must be a chaos player.
7976046	7976667	Yeah, I am.
7977667	7981450	I tried the human side and was like, this is boring.
7981490	7982431	I do this and wow.
7982471	7984573	Let me switch over to the other one.
7984653	7986795	All the dark elves listen to metal.
7986815	7988056	They refuse to dance.
7988816	7989617	That's the way it should be.
7991446	7992507	I've been playing a high elf.
7992547	7993347	It's been kind of fun.
7993628	7995769	Because I feel like I'm going around judging everyone.
7995829	7996229	It's fun.
7997690	7998610	Yeah, I loved it.
7998630	8002592	Every time I clicked on Slash Dance, it's like, so-and-so refuses to dance.
8002733	8004133	That's the way it should be, right there.
8004313	8006595	Are you suggesting that your night elf is Judge Dredd?
8008416	8010797	No, she's more of Judge Hershey, actually.
8010857	8011617	But, you know, whatever.
8013058	8014359	Isn't that the one on Divorce Court?
8016139	8018840	No, there's a Judge Hershey in Judge Dredge, just a female one.
8018980	8021961	Oh, God, okay, I'm thinking, okay, I'm thinking a TV show.
8021981	8025242	Yeah, I noticed a female one, but whatever.
8025382	8026983	So you're liking Warhammer Online.
8027003	8035025	For somebody that's never played an MMO before in their life, let's say they're just turned off by the whole MMO idea, is there anything for them in Warhammer that might change their mind?
8035906	8040027	Well, this is a good gateway drug for a WoW-like experience, definitely.
8040267	8043108	Especially with the public quests, you get to see what a large...
8043680	8044881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8068428	8085523	and also when you go Realm vs. Realm, like if you actually go into the closed capture the flag and stuff like that, they took a note from City of Heroes and sidekick you up to an appropriate level so that way you can actually do something at level one if you wanted to.
8085643	8086484	That is so funny.
8086544	8087425	I brought up the same point.
8087785	8088686	I thought it was great too.
8089106	8089687	I thought it was great.
8090768	8092009	Yeah, but that's all I had, guys.
8092269	8093050	I appreciate it.
8093801	8097925	We appreciate your phone call and appreciate the review on Warhammer Online.
8098586	8101088	Unfortunately, not a lot of folks, it sounds like, have checked it out yet.
8102229	8104311	Real quick plug for your show, then we'll take another call.
8105472	8107774	Ultimate Quest, every Thursday after Video Game Outsiders.
8107855	8110397	Give us a listen and give us some feedback.
8111698	8112739	What topics on the show this week?
8112799	8113320	More Warhammer?
8114818	8122323	This week we're kind of on hiatus, mainly due to real life issues, but we plan on doing another show next week, and hopefully I'll have some new content for you by then.
8122763	8128226	Also, tell your listeners, we need more banners on the OLR PSP All Games Radio player.
8128246	8129467	So we need an Ultimate Quest banner.
8129667	8130147	Exactly.
8130167	8132048	We'll have to make it happen.
8132088	8135110	As soon as Foodie's done with his thesis, I'll flog him and get him right on it.
8135310	8135890	Alright, sounds good.
8136691	8137712	Take care, Xenobor.
8138392	8138632	Later.
8139653	8145157	He's got a great radio voice, too, so you know that show is gonna be fun, because you can hear him calling in R's, you can just tell.
8145517	8153022	You know, there's certain people that call in this show that have really good radio voices, like VX Jason's another good one, Rob D. Bobby's got a great radio voice.
8153782	8155003	Bobby has a wonderful radio voice.
8155023	8155704	Stop being mean.
8156906	8158648	You're just mad because he censors you on his show.
8158929	8159670	I don't care.
8160070	8164055	And he wouldn't be your friend on PlayStation Network or something.
8164075	8164536	No, I'm just kidding.
8164996	8166578	Alright, more calls.
8166598	8169902	877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8169922	8172906	Was there any more to the mod story you were talking about?
8174148	8175650	No, just that I'm not going to finish it now.
8177173	8179414	Fine, be that way, asshole.
8179654	8181456	I do have something real quick, and this is awesome.
8182356	8190641	What show, or I should say, what game had a show that was on PBS with a doo-wop group that is now going to be on the DS?
8191301	8194483	That would be, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego coming to the DS?
8194503	8194803	Yes!
8195083	8195844	That's great.
8196764	8198645	Does it have the doo-wop group?
8198805	8200266	No, it does not have the doo-wop group.
8200506	8201327	Find it, find it, find it, find it.
8202137	8203600	It's an adventure game with a learning curve.
8204722	8208369	It's got high-standing 3D graphics.
8208389	8213899	I've never heard that description before, but coming sometime soon.
8213939	8214240	I don't know.
8214881	8215081	Where?
8216002	8218324	Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Rockapella.
8218344	8219945	I want this fucking song in Rock Band.
8220045	8222887	Yes, I realize there's no guitar or drums.
8223028	8224289	I don't give a shit.
8240712	8249455	Carmen Sandiego God, I loved Carmen Sandiego.
8249835	8252276	Not just the show, but the game itself was actually a shitload of fun.
8252296	8253557	They also had a cool cartoon series.
8254037	8254237	Yes.
8254837	8260539	That's the best theme song to any game show ever.
8263444	8264044	Oh, love it.
8264625	8266065	Our phone's not really ringing tonight.
8266105	8268026	I guess we have a very apathetic... Someone call us!
8268306	8269627	We have a very apathetic crowd tonight.
8269647	8270547	At least one more call.
8270627	8274189	I mean, no offense to Xenocore, but I don't want him to be the only one that's on the show tonight.
8275290	8286334	Apparently, Wiis are going to be harder to mod now that they are being... Some of their drive ICs are now being encased in epoxy, so you actually have to dissolve that shit before you can mod it.
8286815	8289016	Or you can use one of the contacts on the bottom of the board.
8289116	8291257	So it's not impossible, but just making it a little harder.
8292517	8307367	and if you're not into booting say backed up games you can still do import games with a bunch of new stuff including Gecko OS version 1.07 which will now allow you to boot import games without a mod chip.
8309489	8312271	Hello Ranma, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, what's up?
8313280	8314301	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8332943	8333324	Really?
8333744	8334364	Hmm.
8334384	8334985	What a shock.
8335405	8337406	Why four?
8337706	8338187	What now?
8338247	8339328	Let's get out the list.
8339568	8342790	Hey, we should actually, you know what we should have?
8342810	8343210	What's that?
8343270	8344131	You know what I want to do?
8344231	8345051	Okay, we need to do this.
8345091	8345572	How can we do this?
8345832	8348234	Okay, in the studio, I don't know if you see on Justin TV right now.
8348574	8352837	In the studio, there's a big blank, I'm sorry, there's a big blank space right here.
8353217	8359441	And I'm thinking what we ought to do is we ought to start over here like a giant poster board and just a big list.
8359761	8362043	Things that piss us off about GameStop.
8362984	8367437	And we'll just have a list and start adding to it as people call in and what have you.
8368462	8369603	I like that!
8369663	8370843	I don't know, what do you guys think in chat?
8370883	8372084	Is that a good idea, a bad idea?
8372104	8372724	What do you guys think?
8373505	8378107	Maybe it should be like, put them on notice.
8379347	8381929	Putting things on notice this week?
8382149	8383530	I think it should be a whiteboard.
8384250	8386131	Okay, I'm going to go to Target this week and get a whiteboard.
8386591	8390853	And we're either going to do a GameStop list or a list of things on notice this week.
8391474	8391994	So we'll see.
8392374	8394475	Alright, well, Rama, sorry, I know that's not what you wanted to talk about.
8394875	8396236	What pissed you off about GameStop?
8397338	8403562	Well, me and a roommate were planning on picking up Rock Band 2, and he loves the drums, so we're like, let's get the new drum kit.
8403923	8410928	So I called over to make sure they had it in stock, then I asked them, are you buying back the old Rock Band 1 drum kit?
8410948	8413650	I'm like, they should, and they're like, oh no, we're not buying them back.
8413810	8414690	And I'm like, how come?
8414870	8416091	We're just not, click.
8417933	8419394	Wow, what wonderful customer service.
8420775	8421195	Yeah.
8422156	8426819	So we're probably going to end up putting them on Craigslist and going to another place to buy the drum kit.
8427512	8428272	I'm like, what the hell?
8428893	8429353	Yeah, I know.
8429633	8433755	I remember calling GameStop once and they were like, I'm too busy to answer your question.
8433775	8434715	You just have to come to the store.
8434815	8440598	And I understand that they might actually be really busy, but there's just better ways to say it.
8440718	8441218	You know what I mean?
8441278	8445620	Like working in customer service myself, I'm kind of an ass when it comes to things like that.
8445660	8446100	You know what I mean?
8446740	8449742	It's just kind of like, you know, just, hey dude, just tell me, you know.
8450462	8453264	Unfortunately, I have a line of about five people right now.
8453664	8458926	Could you possibly call back in a little bit or, you know, just, you know, could I take your number and call you back, you know, or something.
8459567	8464049	Just, I wish they would do something like that, but I'm dreaming of a perfect world.
8464069	8466230	You and me both.
8466830	8468531	What else is going on in your gaming world?
8468631	8468891	Ranma?
8470312	8471933	I've just been playing a lot more of my 360 and...
8474142	8478065	On a bit of a sad note to you, Rob, I'm not going to be able to do the game fly audition.
8478725	8479225	The game what?
8480186	8481186	The game fly audition.
8482587	8483688	Oh, it didn't work out.
8483748	8484148	Why?
8484248	8484929	Why can't you do it?
8486690	8489452	More people got fired at my job, so guess who's covering shifts?
8490692	8491353	Ah, bummer.
8491413	8491693	Yeah.
8491793	8493174	Well, you know you can still send in a tape.
8493434	8494174	I don't think you should give up.
8494295	8495215	I think you should send in a tape.
8496536	8502019	Well, I probably will end up doing it since I get a free moment because I had Joe Diaz camcorder here, so he might be able to pull that off.
8502259	8502800	Oh, there you go.
8503971	8504791	Thank you for saying the name.
8504851	8505932	Hopefully I'll remember it this time.
8507412	8511614	She lowed when I told her you almost died trying to pronounce her name.
8512374	8514075	I'm trying, I'm trying.
8514195	8516356	How many different languages have I had to learn on this program?
8516396	8518016	We have Japanese, now Italian.
8518276	8520457	I'm trying.
8522178	8524899	Anything else you want to share tonight with listeners, Ranma?
8526343	8534049	Pax, 2009, OLL Army of New York in California, getting together, we're getting a suite, it's gonna happen.
8534609	8536370	Holy fucking shit, yes please.
8536891	8537891	Yes please.
8538111	8538792	That's all I have to say.
8540393	8540934	Thank you very much.
8541834	8542134	Oh yeah.
8542254	8543135	Have a good one, Ranma.
8543675	8543836	Ranma.
8543876	8544316	Ranchan.
8545377	8545617	Heart.
8545637	8546237	Yesukchan.
8546938	8547458	Heart.
8548359	8549460	No, Heart's on Friday.
8550362	8553944	I know, we're going to see Heart.
8554124	8555985	I need to have a voice by then.
8556105	8559907	You know DarkSakura loves her heart and I love my journey and they are touring together.
8559927	8567651	They're going to be here on Friday and we are going to the concert and I'm so excited I can hardly contain myself.
8567972	8570413	Rob is so excited he can hardly contain his bladder.
8571093	8572814	I have to go to the bathroom right now.
8572994	8574895	She's coming right with you because she loves hearts too.
8575155	8576916	Oh my god, she should totally teleport out here.
8577317	8578637	We actually have an extra ticket right now.
8578657	8579338	We're trying to get rid of it.
8580418	8580758	It's funny.
8581319	8583582	She will find her way out in one way or another.
8583863	8586646	Even if it means she has to pull a GTA and steal somebody's car and do it.
8587568	8588529	She better start driving.
8588549	8589450	She's got a long way to go.
8589730	8590411	Alright, we gotta let you go.
8590431	8591633	We gotta see if any more calls come in.
8591973	8592514	Have a good one, buddy.
8592574	8593656	Alright, bye.
8593696	8593956	Bye.
8594737	8597721	Yeah, if anyone in Sacramento wants to come along...
8598908	8599449	That we know.
8599809	8602071	No strangers, please, because, you know, that might be weird.
8602331	8603352	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8603372	8603812	Who's this?
8604413	8606615	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.
8606695	8607555	It is Jason.
8607715	8608957	Hello, Jason land.
8609017	8610218	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
8610298	8611018	What's on your mind?
8611839	8626912	So, speaking of heart, have you guys seen the article that Heart published, that had published in a magazine, I believe it was sometime this last week, about the Republican National Committee, specifically McCain, using Barracuda in one of his ads?
8627791	8631332	Yes, I somehow had a bad feeling you were going to take this show back to politics.
8632332	8634573	You guys mentioned it earlier.
8634613	8635653	You were talking about the tour.
8635673	8638994	I had to ask to make sure you guys have actually seen it because it was priceless.
8639154	8639814	It's fine, yes.
8639874	8654277	And for those that aren't in the know, Hart got their feathers ruffled big time because one of the nicknames for Sarah Palin, who's the vice presidential nominee issued over the Republican Party, one of her nicknames in Alaska was Sarah Barracuda.
8654817	8655878	I can see Russia from my house.
8656458	8657058	Sarah Barracuda.
8657839	8666730	So they actually played Barracuda at the Republican National Convention, which is, as you know, a very popular Heart song, where you gamers probably know it from Guitar Hero 3, because it's in that game.
8667571	8668432	And Heart was pissed.
8669349	8671351	Yeah, I think that they're anything but Republican.
8671932	8678538	Yeah, you know, a lot of musicians get pissed off when that stuff is used because it makes it look like the musician endorses that candidate when they often don't.
8679239	8679860	And it happens both ways.
8679880	8682182	Remember when Reagan used Born in the USA?
8682763	8689870	And Springsteen threw a hissy over that, especially since the song was pretty much about nothing the Republican Party stands for.
8690490	8706533	and I'm sure it works both ways like you know there's a lot of artists like country artists and you know I think you've seen people on the convention that were Republican and they probably don't want their songs being used in Obama's campaign so it's just politics what a big mess
8707850	8716852	I seem to remember when I was reading through the news that that's actually like the third time that artists have not been asked, not been directly compensated, and threw a hissy fit over it.
8717252	8719393	Well, specifically for the public inside of the campaign.
8719413	8722393	Whoever's been getting the music clearances over there needs to be sacked.
8722734	8725114	And then whoever hired that person also needs to be sacked.
8726274	8728715	This is quite possibly going to be a very short answer.
8728975	8731576	I had to step out because I really needed to get some food during the show.
8732036	8737317	But have we covered the epic rock band crash and character transfer of Doom tonight?
8737890	8738910	No, what's this about?
8738950	8739290	What's up?
8739851	8747673	I believe it was SSJ100Matt published a, put a link in chat like an hour and a half ago, pretty shortly after the show started.
8748333	8762817	And apparently for, it looks to be kind of skimmed, but for local games, characters, created Rock Band 2 characters would switch profiles that they were bound to, like they would be written out to the wrong gamer tag.
8763277	8766398	So when one person goes back and plays, his character is completely gone.
8768091	8789009	and apparently band progress is getting completely deleted apparently randomly perhaps when the console freezes up and just really really poorly there's about 11 pages on the rock band forums that talk about all these problems people have been having and quite unfortunately I kind of don't want to play the game until I hear of a patch
8789716	8798104	No, what's funny is one thing I did do is I signed up on the Rock Band forums or whatever and you can link your gamertag to the actual community.
8798444	8800566	It's only shown my Rock Band 1 stuff.
8802027	8803669	I did that with the original Rock Band.
8803709	8805110	I haven't done that since I got 2 yet.
8805475	8810636	But they don't have any of my Rock Band 2 stuff on there, even though I've been playing it online for like a while now.
8810756	8816618	It probably takes a while to catch up, though, because there's probably like tons and tons and tons of people that are all playing this game online right now.
8816638	8820259	And that's probably what's causing the crashes, too, is just like, you know, they're just probably overwhelmed.
8820559	8823280	I mean, on one hand, you ought to think they know how popular their game's going to be.
8823600	8827981	But at the same time, you know, you don't really know the strain until you put it out there.
8828081	8828521	You know what I mean?
8828561	8832382	Like you can test and test and test all you want, but you just don't know until it's out there.
8833419	8840685	Again, I'll restate that I only skimmed it, but I seem to remember that it was limited to local games and not quite online.
8841126	8849653	In which case, the whole thing comes up of, do people really test it in such a narrow instance that they never had these problems when the game was being developed?
8849753	8856558	It just really shocks me that the scores are just resetting, because I would think at least a backup copy saved on your local drive, if nothing else.
8857119	8857940	I would imagine.
8858040	8860061	And the one thing that bugs me more than anything is...
8860982	8861182	I don't.
8861203	8861223	I...
8876581	8878101	There's a button code out there.
8878141	8885203	I don't want to ruin it for everybody, but if you want to search the internet, there's a button code that you can do on the cheat menu that will unlock all the songs automatically.
8885603	8886983	Is that temporary, though?
8887003	8889003	Doesn't it not save your progress when you use any of those?
8889704	8890764	No, they disabled it this time.
8891164	8892084	Well, here's what it does.
8893284	8901606	It's the same code as in the first Rock Band game, and what it does on the cheat menu is it adds a toggle where you can toggle all songs off or all songs on.
8902746	8908267	and if you turn them on then you can't save but you know it's more for like parties and that kind of thing.
8908287	8913789	Right I was just going to say that sounds perfect for if I have a bunch of people over really want to play and I just throw it in quick play or something.
8913989	8920250	Yeah you can toggle it on and off once you've done it it'll save that little toggle on there and you can turn it on off or whatever.
8920450	8923051	It's under the game modifier section under options.
8924011	8927554	So first correction, it was Sephiroth1215, it wasn't SSJ100Matt.
8928795	8938502	And apparently, I don't know if the forum is just overloaded or if they shit-canned this thread or something, but I'm getting an error when I tried to browse to it again.
8938962	8945307	I posted it in chat in case anybody else was curious, but something tells me nobody else is going to have any more luck than I am right now.
8946309	8951735	So, you know, I was trying to load the thread, too, and I had the same problem.
8951795	8953096	So, yeah, something's up.
8953977	8954257	Lovely.
8954457	8954818	Interesting.
8956379	8960103	So, all right, well, Jason, hey, we're going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the show, all right?
8960724	8961024	All righty.
8961264	8962085	Have a good one, my friend, though.
8962105	8962866	Bye, guys.
8963166	8965789	And, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, before you go, you're a drummer, right?
8965989	8966229	What?
8967290	8968071	You're a drummer, right?
8969418	8975060	primarily, yeah you need to join the band that Shane and I have starting because we need a drummer what are you guys doing?
8975240	8998446	we have a band called the Emergency Kittens I'll contact you with more info later sweet, sounds good alright, later yes, drummer recruited I mean, I could have gone to Bobby Blackwolf but he said that he's got like a million people that he's playing with I'd always play a game with Bobby Blackwolf too if he wants to look me up and any drummer, really alright, real quick, one more call real quick, one more call, who's this?
8999994	9000994	This is James Patrick.
9001074	9001935	Hey, James Patrick.
9001975	9002435	Quick question.
9002455	9002955	What's on your mind?
9005556	9009758	I haven't been listening to the whole show, but have you guys talked about Monster Hunter 3 Tri?
9010118	9011519	The information that's come out about it?
9011639	9012099	We have not.
9012119	9013680	Why don't you share that information with our audience?
9015300	9018862	Yeah, a bunch of screenshots and stuff from Famitsu has come out recently.
9018982	9022363	It's confirmed for player online.
9023704	9026185	The city will act as a lobby, apparently.
9027265	9028686	It will appear at TGS.
9030691	9036194	The engine has been completely rebuilt apparently for the first time since the first Monster Hunter game.
9038995	9046259	And yeah, there's just a bunch of screenshots out there showing the game and it looks like Capcom is actually putting forth a lot of effort into this Wii game.
9047260	9047780	It looks pretty.
9048200	9050021	What is it that you love so much about Monster Hunter?
9051262	9051862	I haven't played it.
9055442	9059643	I know people who've played it and they're very enthusiastic about it.
9059803	9063025	So I think I'll try it with this game.
9063265	9067346	4Player Online.
9067866	9071887	If they use the WeSpeak, I guess that might be the thing that gets me to get WeSpeak.
9077803	9092243	It's got underwater battles as well, and you can go underwater and the monsters can go up above and underwater too apparently, and you can fight them in a different environment.
9092764	9094166	That sounds like it might be interesting.
9094844	9096585	Huh, sounds like it could be a pretty cool game.
9096846	9106413	Well, James Patrick, thank you so much for the heads up, and we'll be counting down the days until this, and call us back and let us know how it plays out, because unfortunately I've got so many games I'm playing, I probably won't get around to this one.
9106713	9108034	We'll look to you for a review, okay?
9109575	9110236	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
9112077	9112457	Alright.
9113157	9114618	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9114718	9121719	If you didn't get through tonight and still want to talk to us, hey, there's always the email bag or our chat room or our MySpace, our Facebook, our LiveJournal, our Twitter.
9121959	9124460	There's like a million different ways to find us and interact with us.
9124600	9126520	And you know we love reaching out to you guys.
9126800	9127880	You guys help us make the show.
9128200	9129281	Any more last-minute stories, Loki?
9129441	9129641	Yes.
9129761	9134822	In fact, you would have heard about this early on Twitter because I posted it on Twitter before the news got out.
9135302	9140503	But Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts RE Chains of Memories is coming
9140943	9146044	To be fair, you posted it on your personal Twitter and not the OLR Twitter, and folks may not know you have your own personal.
9146144	9147245	Yeah, whatever.
9147885	9155527	Anyways, so it's the remake that, of course, came out with Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix is now coming to the U.S.
9155607	9159368	to PlayStation 2 in December on the 2nd for $29.99.
9160428	9161649	So that's not a bad deal.
9161949	9166730	And, of course, they're adding some new stuff along with that, a brand new voice cast, new minigames.
9168366	9170147	Hey, 30 bucks, that's not bad at all.
9170227	9173267	And apparently Rockband.com is down right now.
9174048	9176828	Anyways, some other stuff.
9177068	9180069	And this wasn't on Cheryl at all, but I just remembered it.
9181209	9189992	You remember last year how they did bundles with the Xbox 360 and you got free games for no additional cost?
9191292	9196694	Well, they're doing that again this holiday and I have what games and which consoles?
9198413	9204977	The arcade system actually is getting, I don't know if this is that great, but Sega Superstars Tennis.
9206378	9212482	And the elite and pro systems are both getting two games each.
9213203	9217325	And those would be Kung Fu Panda and Lego Indiana Jones.
9218686	9220668	So that's not bad for free for the holidays.
9221208	9227332	I guess they're trying to target more of that family audience to fill that hole in their demographic there.
9228590	9230892	Alright, and let's see here.
9232214	9241243	Lastly, I was going to mention that around the time when LittleBigPlanet comes out, they're going to be offering some free download content, one of which is a spacesuit.
9241963	9244025	So yes, you can be a spaceman as well.
9244065	9245467	Is that only for pre-orders or something?
9245627	9251313	No, it's just they're going to offer it for a limited time during the first week when it comes out.
9251813	9273074	and also you can get a rare t-shirt in it that says I was there for week one um those are both gonna be free to download and um the very last thing this kind of goes back to if you're listening live and heard our little funk remixes on there uh you too can check those out for free um they're all free to download off of the guys website um
9273875	9278098	B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K B-J-O-R-K
9301394	9302474	Yeah, Lyd Bjork.
9302935	9303215	Nice.
9303915	9305836	And, uh, those are all free to download.
9305876	9314779	He has, uh, Nintensploitation, and then there's another album, uh, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo, which, uh, when I was playing one of those Aug files, it crashed my computer, so.
9315260	9315500	Don't.
9316180	9316260	Uh,
9316480	9317981	Yeah, so I stopped playing those.
9318041	9321922	But the first album that he has, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo, is a lot of Mega Man stuff.
9322042	9332166	And some of the other games he remixes, Disney's DuckTales, there's a few tracks on there from that, and Gunsmoke, and of course, oh, there's one from Maniac Mansion.
9332326	9332886	That's kind of cool.
9334346	9335507	Alright, very cool.
9335727	9338048	Some of them are good, some of them are alright.
9338188	9344650	Like, there was one from Mario Brothers or something that's kind of weird.
9346525	9348188	or Link's Got a Bop Gun.
9348208	9349289	That was kind of a weird one.
9350987	9352288	So, alright, that's it.
9352568	9353289	Awesome, awesome.
9353589	9358312	Well, DarkSakura, I'd ask if you have any last minute stories, but I know your voice is not doing too hot.
9358772	9358933	No.
9359313	9361274	So, well, I hope you feel better.
9362335	9370801	In the meantime, I hope the allergies die down and stop scratching at your throat, because that's very rude when you're a radio person to do that.
9370821	9374083	It feels like an undead bird crawled into my throat and made a nest.
9374744	9375284	You, you.
9375324	9376445	Fuck, fuck.
9376745	9380508	Well, I will ask for one more thing from you tonight, and that is your final thought.
9381659	9382620	Thank God I don't like Heath bars.
9404055	9408078	My final thought is frozen yogurt sounds really awesome right now.
9408138	9408798	That's what I want.
9409559	9410780	I really want frozen yogurt right now.
9411380	9412461	Hey, thank you guys so much.
9412641	9414883	Unfortunately, the frozen yogurt place closes at 9 and it's now 9.05.
9416824	9421027	Thank you guys for staying up and listening to us tonight and supporting independent radio.
9421067	9424509	Hey, if you like what you heard, tell two friends about our show.
9424729	9425750	That's how we spread the word.
9425790	9427511	It's all via word of mouth, you guys.
9428131	9428892	Really appreciate it.
9428992	9430993	Or you could leave us a five-star review on iTunes.
9431434	9432975	We've had a few people do that this week.
9433015	9433455	Thank you guys.
9433635	9436720	So much to the new five-star reviews we've had left on iTunes.
9436740	9437441	Really appreciate it.
9437681	9439864	Cheeseburger, message me with dongle.
9441006	9443488	Yeah, I saw Dongle show up on Twitter.
9444469	9453295	Let's see, we had MozartFX left a nice five-star review, and Skylark91 left a nice one, WarriorBob a few days ago.
9453675	9456677	Dan Shadow, who emailed us, left a nice five-star review not that long ago.
9456697	9459359	So thank you guys so much who have left the nice reviews for us on iTunes.
9459559	9460700	Every little bit helps.
9461120	9462101	We really appreciate it.
9462121	9464042	Have we got any one-star reviews on there?
9464923	9469446	If we did, I would not acknowledge them on this program because we don't want to encourage more people to do it.
9470206	9472187	because actually one star reviews really hurt.
9472487	9476068	Look, if you want to give the show a one star review, don't do that.
9476188	9479050	Go give a show you like more a five star review.
9479350	9480490	It's much more impactful.
9480510	9484772	Go help a show you do like then because it's just kind of rude to leave a one star review in my opinion.
9485252	9487013	Alright, that's it.
9487233	9487773	We're out of here.
9487893	9488633	Have a good night everybody.
9488653	9493975	We'll see you next week with episode 296 of Orange Lounge Radio as we inch closer to that big 300 mark.
