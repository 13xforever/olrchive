26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
33000	36000	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	38000	We are that podcast on the internet
38000	41000	Dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture
41000	43000	And the gamer lifestyle
43000	45000	We always tape live on Sunday nights
45000	47000	At about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time
47000	49000	On AllGames.com
49000	51000	Although we're getting a little bit of a late start tonight
51000	53000	The show before us, The Bobby Black Wolf Show
53000	54000	Ran over just a smidge
54000	56000	But that's kind of our fault
56000	58000	Because we're always on at the end of his show
58000	61000	And then we had a little teeny weeny snafu
61000	62000	Transitioning between shows
62000	64000	So we're a little bit late start tonight
64000	66000	But we are live and running
66000	67000	And my name is Rob Roberts
67000	69000	I join you here every week on the program
69000	70000	And also join you every week
70000	72000	Say hello to the one and only
72000	74000	Happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura
74000	75000	Jamie Summers
75000	76000	Hi
76000	77000	How are you doing, Jamie Summers?
77000	78000	I have no voice
78000	79000	Did you eat a frog?
79000	80000	No, I didn't
80000	81000	What happened?
81000	84000	When it got a little bit cooler here
84000	87000	The wind picked up and blew all of the pollen around
87000	91000	And well, I'm very prone to sinus infections
91000	93000	And I'm trying to fight off one
93000	95000	You know what you need?
95000	96000	A SARS mask
96000	97000	You know what I need?
97000	98000	What?
98000	99000	Power thirst
99000	102000	It's made from lightning
102000	103000	Awesome
103000	107000	Alright, so also say hello to the one and only
107000	108000	Techmaster Loki
108000	109000	Yes
109000	110000	Knock it off
110000	111000	Sorry, Loki, not you
111000	112000	What's up, Loki?
112000	113000	Not much
113000	116000	I figured out why that song cut off pre-show
116000	117000	Okay, hold on
117000	118000	We gotta explain now
118000	119000	For the people listening on the podcast
119000	120000	Before we go live
120000	121000	We always like play a song
121000	123000	To kind of transition from the previous show
123000	124000	To our show
124000	125000	And tonight was
125000	126000	What is this?
126000	127000	A Funk to the Past
127000	128000	Was the song that we played
128000	129000	Yes, Ninten-sploitation
129000	130000	Uh-huh
130000	131000	Nintendo-sploitation
131000	132000	It's by
132000	136000	Lime Mutterplucken B
136000	139000	Is the name of the guy that does it
139000	140000	Unique
140000	141000	It all
141000	142000	They all flow together each song
142000	144000	So that's why part of the song is on another track
144000	145000	Gotcha, because I was like
145000	146000	Why is that song cut off?
146000	147000	That's weird, okay
147000	148000	But it's one of those CDs that transitions
148000	149000	From song to song
149000	150000	I get it
150000	151000	Alrighty
151000	152000	Well, if you would like to join us
152000	154000	And give your input on the show

168000	170000	So we are going to get into tonight's show
170000	172000	We always kick it off with a little bit of insight
172000	174000	On our gaming weeks and the games we've been playing
174000	176000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
176000	178000	Um
178000	180000	I played Ragnarok
180000	182000	Ragnarok
182000	184000	And um
184000	186000	No, I played something else
186000	189000	Here's my occasional question on
189000	190000	Where's Ragnarok 2?
190000	192000	Whatever happened to Ragnarok 2?
192000	194000	It's in beta still
194000	195000	Still?
195000	197000	Hasn't it been beta for like a year and a half?
197000	199000	Usually it's been forever
199000	201000	Do you know how long the first Ragnarok was in beta?
201000	202000	A long, long time?
202000	204000	I played the beta for about three years
204000	205000	Geez
205000	206000	Wow
206000	207000	Alright
207000	209000	So, no, no, not three
209000	211000	It was about
211000	213000	No, it was about two years that I played the beta
213000	215000	Because I started on the
215000	217000	The first closed beta
217000	218000	I think
218000	219000	Or before
219000	220000	No?
220000	221000	Yeah, the first closed beta
221000	222000	So a long time
222000	223000	Yeah
223000	224000	So, wow, geez
224000	226000	I'm sorry you haven't tried to get in on that beta
226000	228000	It's just something about you have to have a Korean
228000	230000	Equivalent of a social security number to get in
230000	231000	I also looked more into it
231000	233000	And the only thing that I'm really interested in is the soundtrack
233000	235000	It's done by Yoko Kanno
235000	236000	Oh nice
236000	238000	Yeah, I mean
238000	240000	As soon as I can find a reliable way to give it a go
240000	242000	I might try, but for right now
242000	243000	There's emulated ways
243000	245000	Alright, fair enough
245000	247000	Well, if that's it for your gaming week
247000	249000	Then, Loki, how was your gaming week?
249000	251000	Um, it was alright
251000	252000	I played
252000	253000	Not a whole lot this week
253000	255000	Mainly
255000	256000	I played a lot of things
256000	258000	Grand Theft Auto IV, of course
258000	260000	Trying to keep on my winning streak
260000	262000	But there was a day that I let it get away from me
262000	264000	For a game or so
264000	265000	But it's back now
265000	267000	So I'm still on my winning streak
267000	269000	And then, um
269000	271000	I played
271000	273000	Some more Mercenaries 2
273000	274000	And I swear
274000	275000	The more I play that game
275000	277000	The more broken it gets
277000	278000	But it's kind of entertaining
278000	280000	Just to see how bad
280000	282000	The glitching will get
282000	284000	And so I'm about
284000	286000	To get my way through it now
286000	288000	And then
288000	290000	I also played
290000	292000	Pure, which is pretty fun
292000	294000	It's an ATV off-road racing game
294000	296000	Kind of a little similar
296000	298000	To Excite Truck, sort of
298000	300000	Um
300000	302000	Controls aren't exactly as tight as Excite Truck
302000	304000	I mean, it's a little bit more realistic
304000	306000	But, um
306000	308000	You know, a lot of flying through the air
308000	310000	And doing tricks and stuff like that
310000	312000	And lots of nitrous, so it's fun
312000	314000	But, um
314000	316000	Yeah, that's pretty much it so far
316000	318000	Alright, well
318000	320000	My gaming week, I actually played something new
320000	322000	This week, I went out and got a copy
322000	324000	Of Warhammer Online
324000	326000	I decided I was gonna take the plunge and go ahead and
326000	328000	Start playing another MMO
328000	330000	So I went and grabbed myself a copy of Warhammer Online
330000	332000	And, um
332000	334000	I don't know, MMOs are really hard to evaluate
334000	336000	You know, it takes a long time because there's so
336000	338000	Much depth to them
338000	340000	That they can take a long time to evaluate
340000	342000	And I'm not sure what my full opinion of Warhammer Online is
342000	344000	I'm still playing it, so that must be a good sign, right?
344000	346000	I had a friend of mine quit after playing it for
346000	348000	About ten minutes
348000	350000	Saying it was garbage
350000	352000	So, I mean, I guess I was into it long enough
352000	354000	To keep going past that
354000	356000	So, you know
356000	358000	Here's the thing, I'll start with what I don't like
358000	360000	About the game
360000	362000	I actually don't care for the graphics
362000	364000	Even though some of the textures are very pretty
364000	366000	And some of the shadow is very cool
366000	368000	For some reason, Warhammer
368000	370000	Feels really clunky to me
370000	372000	Really clunky
372000	374000	There seems to be delay in some of the things I do
374000	376000	And, you know, you could blame my computer's
376000	378000	Performance, but seeing as I just got a new
378000	380000	Quad-core 6GB RAM computer
380000	382000	I don't think it's necessarily the computer's
382000	384000	Specs that are slowing it down
384000	386000	You know, it's just
386000	388000	The interface feels a little clunky to me
388000	390000	It's not so bad that the game
390000	392000	Really suffers because I still
392000	394000	Will play it and everything
394000	396000	But it's a little bit clunky to me
396000	398000	And, I don't know, sometimes I find
398000	400000	The interface to be messy, but it's highly
400000	402000	Highly customizable, which is cool
402000	404000	And they really encourage people to customize this, that's cool
404000	406000	Alright, so, some of the things I do like about the game now
406000	408000	I do like kind of the way
408000	410000	That the game seems to be kind of
410000	412000	Split off into these three
412000	414000	Different areas, you have your PVE
414000	416000	Stuff, which feels pretty much
416000	418000	Like Warcraft, you know, and it's
418000	420000	Go to
420000	422000	Guy with exclamation point overhead
422000	424000	Or in this case, a little book with
424000	426000	A green book, get quest
426000	428000	Go do quest, turn in quest
428000	430000	You know, it's very, very similar to
430000	432000	Kind of the
432000	434000	Warcraft, but what I thought was
434000	436000	Kind of cool was now the different branches
436000	438000	That the game would go down, and that was something
438000	440000	Called Realm vs Realm, which is
440000	442000	Similar, I guess you could say, to PvP
442000	444000	Like, for instance, one of the
444000	446000	Realm vs Realm things I got into was
446000	448000	This thing where it's
448000	450000	For those that have played Warcraft, it's very
450000	452000	Similar to Arathi Basin
452000	454000	But you only have two nodes, and for those that are playing
454000	456000	Warhammer, I'm describing Kain's Embrace
456000	458000	I think that's how you say it
458000	460000	But what's kind of cool about it, what I really liked
460000	462000	Is that, okay, so you have, you know, the order
462000	464000	And you have chaos, and you're trying to capture
464000	466000	Both the nodes, and when one
466000	468000	Team captures both nodes
468000	470000	What's really cool is that it sets off this
470000	472000	Giant, like, alarm, like you hear
472000	474000	A rrrrrrrrr sound, and then
474000	476000	After ten seconds, giant
476000	478000	Explosions happen at both
478000	480000	The nodes to kind of reset the board
480000	482000	So, like, you'll see one team captures the nodes
482000	484000	And then you'll hear the big horn
484000	486000	And then you'll see everybody start running away
486000	488000	Because they want to get out of the explosion
488000	490000	Because if you get into the explosion, you instantly die
490000	492000	And I actually had a lot of fun with it
492000	494000	It was cracking me up, and I thought it was actually
494000	496000	Really well done, so I can
496000	498000	Tell already that the PvP
498000	500000	In this game is pretty well thought out
500000	502000	And done really well, and I
502000	504000	Really like the fact that the game kind of
504000	506000	Gives you buffs, so that, like, let's say
506000	508000	This particular
508000	510000	RVR experience
510000	512000	Is a one versus ten
512000	514000	They call it ranks in Warhammer, but you notice
514000	516000	Levels, let's say it's a level one
516000	518000	Through ten, you know, RVR
518000	520000	Instance, everybody gets bumped up
520000	522000	To rank eight, so that way
522000	524000	You know, even if you're kind of lower
524000	526000	You get the stats of a rank eight character
526000	528000	So that way the playing field seems a little
528000	530000	More level, it seems like they've really
530000	532000	Kind of tested this out and really
532000	534000	Kind of tweaked the PvP in this
534000	536000	So I think if you're, like, a PvP player mostly
536000	538000	You're gonna be drawn to
538000	540000	Warhammer, I think, a lot more
540000	542000	Than WoW, and Warhammer does
542000	544000	Have some PvE elements in it
544000	546000	And the other thing, kind of the other road that Warhammer
546000	548000	Goes down that I thought was kind of cool was the idea
548000	550000	Of public quests, which is
550000	552000	Kind of neat, like, you can go into an area
552000	554000	And there might be an event going on, and again
554000	556000	To compare this to Warcraft, because that's what, you know
556000	558000	I just do that because that's what most you MMO players
558000	560000	Know, I would say, like, imagine
560000	562000	You could just walk into a 25 man
562000	564000	Raid and walk out as you please
564000	566000	That's kind of what a public quest is
566000	568000	You'll go into an area and there might be an event
568000	570000	Going on, like an early event that I played
570000	572000	Was one where you kill 30
572000	574000	Guards, then you protect 30 guards
574000	576000	Then you have to kill a giant dragon
576000	578000	And his Beastmaster, and like that
578000	580000	Whole event kind of goes on, it takes about 15
580000	582000	Minutes to complete, and you can run in and play
582000	584000	As much or as little as you want
584000	586000	But the more you participate in it, the better
586000	588000	Your role is going to be for the loot at the end
588000	590000	And then as you play it, your reputation
590000	592000	Kind of goes up slowly
592000	594000	Does Beastmaster have a pair of ferrets?
594000	596000	No, he does not have a pair of ferrets
596000	598000	He's the Beastmaster over, like, a dragon
598000	600000	There might be a ferret Beastmaster later in the game
600000	602000	I don't know, but uh...
602000	604000	Are they called Kodo and Podo?
604000	606000	No. But yeah, I thought that was kind of neat
606000	608000	That you could slowly gain the
608000	610000	You know, kind of the experience that way
610000	612000	So there's many different ways to
612000	614000	Experience in the game and different types
614000	616000	Of, you know, you have your
616000	618000	Renown is one
618000	620000	And then your experience
620000	622000	You meet the different things to accomplish
622000	624000	But, like, I haven't really gotten a chance
624000	626000	To tackle the crafting
626000	628000	So I feel like there's still a lot more of this game
628000	630000	For me to explore
630000	632000	And the MMO is early
632000	634000	So, you know, while I might be criticizing
634000	636000	The graphical interface and these sorts of things
636000	638000	Early on, there's gonna be
638000	640000	Patches that will probably fix a lot of the stuff
640000	642000	That bugs us. I mean, let's face it
642000	644000	Pretty much any MMO has a lot of issues
644000	646000	When it first launches. So that's another reason
646000	648000	Why I'm like, hmm, I can't really
648000	650000	Review this game in full yet
650000	652000	Because it still has a long way to grow
652000	654000	And develop. But I will say this
654000	656000	If you're a PvPer
656000	658000	You really like the player versus player stuff
658000	660000	I think you're really gonna enjoy Warhammer
660000	662000	Even if you're more of a PvE type person
662000	664000	There's something worth
664000	666000	Checking out here for you. Like, I'm usually not a big
666000	668000	PvPer, but I thought it was set up enough where
668000	670000	I didn't feel like
670000	672000	I was wasting my time
672000	674000	If that makes sense. Like, I was having a good time
674000	676000	And I was enjoying the game. And that's really what it comes down to
676000	678000	So I do recommend
678000	680000	If you like MMOs, check out Warhammer
680000	682000	Online. At least do your research
682000	684000	Check into it. See if it's something you like
684000	686000	Sadly there's no trial for it, really
686000	688000	And I think that's one thing they're severely lacking
688000	690000	And they need to get up and running in the next 60 days
690000	692000	Is get a trial for the people who really
692000	694000	Want to check out what this game's all about
694000	696000	Because they can get away with it for right now
696000	698000	Because the game's got a lot of hype and they're gonna have a lot of initial user base
698000	700000	But I really think if they want to
700000	702000	Really try to sway people
702000	704000	They're gonna need to have a trial similar to
704000	706000	What Warcraft has where you can experience the first
706000	708000	20 levels or so. I think that's what
708000	710000	Warhammer badly needs. Would you guys check out
710000	712000	Warhammer if they had something like that?
712000	714000	Where you didn't have to drop the dollars to check it out? No? Why?
714000	716000	I'm not at all interested in Warhammer
716000	718000	You're not really a big, big MMO player
718000	720000	I mean, you play Ragnarok, but you haven't enjoyed
720000	722000	A lot of the other MMOs you've played. You didn't enjoy
722000	724000	Warcraft, you didn't. That's different.
724000	726000	That's a space one. But I actually
726000	728000	I liked World of Warcraft until
728000	730000	It turned out that it just wasn't worth my time
730000	732000	Loki?
732000	734000	Yeah, I don't play MMOs right now
734000	736000	And even when
736000	738000	My wife joins Warcraft, I may not
738000	740000	Do that. Alright, fair enough.
740000	742000	Although when APB comes around
742000	744000	We'll talk again
744000	746000	Alright, well that's it for my gaming week, otherwise
746000	748000	Just pretty much Rock Band 2 and games you've heard me
748000	750000	Talk about before. So
750000	752000	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight
752000	754000	And tonight for housekeeping, Loki wants to
754000	756000	Talk about olrpsp.com
756000	758000	Well, I was just gonna say that I have a thread
758000	760000	Up in our forum right now
760000	762000	Basically
762000	764000	Allowing you guys to
764000	766000	Submit banners
766000	768000	Because if you notice on the
768000	770000	Olrpsp all games radio player
770000	772000	That there's a little banner
772000	774000	That keeps repeating, and you'll probably have noticed
774000	776000	That there's only three of them. One including
776000	778000	A banner for the PAX
778000	780000	Coverage, which is way old now.
780000	782000	So we need more banners
782000	784000	And it's real easy
784000	786000	Pretty much you can make a banner for
786000	788000	You know, either one of the shows
788000	790000	On the network, one of the
790000	792000	Inside jokes, something
792000	794000	You know, funny like one of the PSAs
794000	796000	Just anything. Just pretty much
796000	798000	Anything that's kind of show related
798000	800000	Or network related
800000	802000	Or indie production related
802000	804000	Yeah, and basically
804000	806000	Just 296 pixels
806000	808000	By 32, and
808000	810000	Why is it such a weird ass banner size?
810000	812000	That's just the size I made it
812000	814000	And there you go
814000	816000	And all the details are on our forums
816000	818000	And you can post your
818000	820000	Images there
820000	822000	Or email them to me
822000	824000	And if they're decent
824000	826000	Then we'll throw them up there
826000	828000	And you can see the awesome
828000	830000	Olrpsp.com, you can see this in action
830000	832000	On that great all games radio
832000	834000	Tuner on the PSP
834000	836000	Awesome
836000	838000	Speaking of please for stuff
838000	840000	You know, we've been having to recycle a lot of the
840000	842000	Audio bumpers we used during our free breaks
842000	844000	In the middle of the show
844000	846000	We haven't done any new stuff lately
846000	848000	So please if you have an independent show you want to plug
848000	850000	You host your own podcast or whatever
850000	852000	Please send me commercials
852000	854000	Fake PSAs, whatever you want to send
854000	856000	That's not for profit
856000	858000	We're looking for more stuff, we really need some stuff
858000	860000	I don't think you're going to hear a lot in tonight's free break
860000	862000	Because I don't want to recycle the same old crap over and over again
862000	864000	Sadly I didn't have time to create anything new today
864000	866000	So we really rely on you guys
866000	868000	For some of the extra stuff
868000	870000	Just send me an email or post on the forums
870000	872000	There's all that cool stuff on there
872000	874000	Rhetortainment is in chat
874000	876000	Reading some comments from chat, he says
876000	878000	I have the latest version of the PSP hardware
878000	880000	I tried to download the all games player on
880000	882000	OLRPSP.com and it didn't work
882000	884000	Any thoughts on what might be going on?
884000	886000	I have no idea
886000	888000	It should work, you just put it in this
888000	890000	It's probably the directory that you have it in
890000	892000	You probably set it in the wrong directory
892000	894000	Try downloading the official radio players
894000	896000	Off of Sony's website
896000	898000	If those work for you
898000	900000	Then I don't know
900000	902000	It's probably the same directory as those
902000	904000	But you test on the latest
904000	906000	PSP firmwares as they're released right?
906000	908000	No
908000	910000	Then again it shouldn't matter
910000	912000	They don't remove anything
912000	914000	From the PSP firmwares
914000	916000	To be honest I don't have any legitimate
916000	918000	Firmwares
918000	920000	It doesn't matter because they're the exact
920000	922000	Same thing plus other added bonuses
922000	924000	I want to read this comment
924000	926000	From earlier because I'm not sure
926000	928000	If it's on the right track or not
928000	930000	Jamie also has bad memories
930000	932000	Involving things like Warhammer right?
932000	934000	Is that true or not?
934000	936000	The Warhammer with the little models
936000	938000	Yeah
938000	940000	What happened?
940000	942000	I had an ex who would play Warhammer to the exclusion of all else
942000	944000	Yikes
944000	946000	And I would have to sit and paint his models
946000	948000	Do you think that he's gotten
948000	950000	Sucked into this thing beyond belief at this point?
950000	952000	Dude I don't know
952000	954000	This is 12 years ago in Alabama
954000	956000	It was worth asking
956000	958000	I don't care what happened
958000	960000	Was it Warhammer or Warhammer 40,000?
960000	962000	It was Warhammer 40k
962000	964000	Keep in mind
964000	966000	My review comes from somebody who has never
966000	968000	Touched a Warhammer model
968000	970000	Or done any of that stuff
970000	972000	I did get vengeance on him once
972000	974000	How so?
974000	976000	He had some sort of big figure that was
976000	978000	This hulking creature
978000	980000	And I painted it hot pink
980000	982000	Nice
982000	984000	That was pretty cool
984000	986000	Well also pretty cool
986000	988000	Some video game news!
988000	990000	Loki, start us off tonight would you?
990000	992000	Alright
992000	994000	This time
994000	996000	I think we may have talked about this a little bit before
996000	998000	But Rock Revolution
998000	1000000	As if you needed more reasons
1000000	1002000	Why it's not gonna be that great
1002000	1004000	Well Konami says that they're not actually gonna put out
1004000	1006000	Any guitars for it
1006000	1008000	So you're gonna need to find your own guitars
1008000	1010000	Whether that be a Guitar Hero guitar
1010000	1012000	A rock band guitar
1012000	1014000	Or you're just gonna need another guitar
1014000	1016000	Cause if you don't own any music game
1016000	1018000	And for some reason you decide this is the one you
1018000	1020000	Want to start off with
1020000	1022000	Well all you're gonna be able to get is just the drums
1022000	1024000	And that's it. No guitars for you
1024000	1026000	You know what do you think of this? Because at first
1026000	1028000	I was kinda like laughing to myself
1028000	1030000	Going, well geez this just kinda goes to show
1030000	1032000	About this game
1032000	1034000	Then as I was thinking about it I was like
1034000	1036000	But at the same time I really don't need another freaking
1036000	1038000	Guitar in my house
1038000	1040000	So in a way I'm thankful
1040000	1042000	Not necessarily I mean they should
1042000	1044000	They have the option of buying the game by itself
1044000	1046000	Or the bundle
1046000	1048000	But the thing is they're just not gonna make a guitar
1048000	1050000	Whatsoever and that's fine if they don't want to do it
1050000	1052000	But I've had you know Konami reps
1052000	1054000	Before tell me oh we're not in the
1054000	1056000	We're not in the peripheral business
1056000	1058000	But yet you have peripherals bundled with
1058000	1060000	Your DDR bundles so
1060000	1062000	You're a liar
1062000	1064000	Basically
1064000	1066000	But yeah they're not trying to be in the peripheral business
1066000	1068000	Yet they're making a game with peripherals
1068000	1070000	So they're kind of
1070000	1072000	Well plus the fact that
1072000	1074000	It's not like Konami's never made a guitar controller
1074000	1076000	Before they just didn't do it
1076000	1078000	Here it's probably they just don't want to make another
1078000	1080000	One they probably have reasons
1080000	1082000	And it's maybe something to do with
1082000	1084000	You know the fact that they've licensed out there
1084000	1086000	Designed for guitars
1086000	1088000	To other companies or something maybe there's something
1088000	1090000	Legal
1090000	1092000	That we don't see
1092000	1094000	Yet I mean that's part of the lawsuit
1094000	1096000	Or something that's why they didn't do it
1096000	1098000	And that's why they only did drum controller
1098000	1100000	Maybe I'm thinking
1100000	1102000	That's got to be the reason because if you notice the drum
1102000	1104000	Controllers that they have out there
1104000	1106000	They're not exactly rip offs
1106000	1108000	Of the original
1108000	1110000	Drum mania controller
1110000	1112000	Except for Konami's which is obviously
1112000	1114000	It looks like kind of a rip off of the original
1114000	1116000	Drum mania controller but they can do that since it's theirs
1116000	1118000	And it sucked for the record
1118000	1120000	Yeah so
1120000	1122000	That's my thing is that maybe they
1122000	1124000	These people are paying to license
1124000	1126000	You know these guitars or something
1126000	1128000	And I don't know
1128000	1130000	Non compete thing or something I don't know
1130000	1132000	You know Bobby Blackwolf
1132000	1134000	Is in our chat right now and he obviously does the show
1134000	1136000	Before us here on All Games he says
1136000	1138000	I find it funny this is news when Konami has always
1138000	1140000	Said this Konami told me at E3 that they are
1140000	1142000	Only making a drum peripheral and really
1142000	1144000	It's one less plastic instrument you have to buy
1144000	1146000	And yeah I want to say Loki saw something
1146000	1148000	In the retail world that indicated this is going to be
1148000	1150000	True a while ago too but it's kind of
1150000	1152000	Interesting because you see the trailers for Rock Revolution
1152000	1154000	Hitting this week and there's really no
1154000	1156000	Hint at this whole thing
1156000	1158000	And what about the fact that people are going to be
1158000	1160000	Buying this game maybe expecting that there's
1160000	1162000	Going to be a guitar with it because that's what you see
1162000	1164000	In the other bundles
1164000	1166000	Well it will just have to be very clear on the box
1166000	1168000	That it's not going to happen
1168000	1170000	You and I both know it will be in tiny tiny print
1170000	1172000	Somewhere, guitar not included
1172000	1174000	Well I think it's also you know the guitar
1174000	1176000	Not included I don't even remember if they have
1176000	1178000	Vocals in this as well I think
1178000	1180000	No they don't have
1180000	1182000	Vocals in it before they were going to
1182000	1184000	But they accidentally
1184000	1186000	So it's just a guitar and drums
1186000	1188000	And
1188000	1190000	I don't know I don't think it's a big deal because
1190000	1192000	Shit you can buy used guitars like used
1192000	1194000	Guitar Hero 2 guitars for like 12 bucks
1194000	1196000	So
1196000	1198000	Doesn't really matter but
1198000	1200000	I don't know
1200000	1202000	Whatever do what they want to do the game is going to suck anyways
1202000	1204000	Are you sure?
1204000	1206000	And again
1206000	1208000	Having not played it what's your basis for this?
1208000	1210000	My basis for it is it looks cheap
1210000	1212000	All the videos I've seen from it look cheap
1212000	1214000	All the gameplay from it I've seen looks very cheap
1214000	1216000	It just looks like a cheap knock off
1216000	1218000	And that's sad because you know
1218000	1220000	They were the ones that pioneered this
1220000	1222000	But it's just a cheap knock off
1222000	1224000	What their problem was is they
1224000	1226000	Did it right to start with in Japan
1226000	1228000	But they didn't realize that their American
1228000	1230000	User base would be interested in the same stuff too
1230000	1232000	So it was they started way
1232000	1234000	Too late
1234000	1236000	And I'll quote Bobby that there is
1236000	1238000	One of the icons for the drum
1238000	1240000	Is actually a dark grey
1240000	1242000	Come on
1242000	1244000	That's retarded what were you thinking
1244000	1246000	You know and I've said this on the show before
1246000	1248000	I don't know if I want to continue to beat a dead horse
1248000	1250000	But you know in a way
1250000	1252000	If Konami is going to assume
1252000	1254000	You know what happens about assuming
1254000	1256000	That this stuff is not going to
1256000	1258000	Take off in America you know then they have
1258000	1260000	No one to blame but themselves for what's happening now
1260000	1262000	I mean and this
1262000	1264000	Sounds all conspiracy theory
1264000	1266000	Like but I really think
1266000	1268000	That they're making this so that it doesn't
1268000	1270000	Do well so that they can sue
1270000	1272000	Them so they have reason
1272000	1274000	To say hey look your game is causing
1274000	1276000	Our game not to sell
1276000	1278000	But
1278000	1280000	I don't think that that
1280000	1282000	Would fly in court and they know it
1282000	1284000	They'd have to know better
1284000	1286000	Alright well let's see what you guys
1286000	1288000	The listeners thought because OLR is the show
1288000	1290000	How long did they register any
1290000	1292000	Licenses for Guitar Freak
1292000	1294000	For Guitar Freak Surger Mania
1294000	1296000	They did Guitar Revolution a while back
1296000	1298000	Well they also had an arcade release of Guitar Freaks here
1298000	1300000	So you know that's years old
1300000	1302000	I don't know if that would count for a console
1302000	1304000	Well now that I think of it Guitar Revolution and Drum Revolution
1304000	1306000	Oh Rock Revolution here we go
1306000	1308000	Alright anyhow
1308000	1310000	Let's go to the pre-OLR
1310000	1312000	Twitter to see what you guys
1312000	1314000	Out there thought and we asked on our Twitter
1314000	1316000	Our username on Twitter if you're a Twitter user you should
1316000	1318000	Add us it's just simply OLR
1318000	1320000	Before every show we ask questions
1320000	1322000	This week we asked are you getting Rock Revolution
1322000	1324000	Why or why not
1324000	1326000	DGRamaS said possibly problem is
1326000	1328000	Real estate space but if the game works with
1328000	1330000	Guitar Hero Rock Band Controllers then yes
1330000	1332000	And I think it's been pretty well known now that
1332000	1334000	Yes it will work with both
1334000	1336000	So that's a yes
1336000	1338000	Picaruno says hell no because that's the answer I gave
1338000	1340000	Last time I guess during the show we must
1340000	1342000	Ask this before once
1342000	1344000	The SEG said no I enjoy the
1344000	1346000	Careful selection harmonics practices
1346000	1348000	In their set list they are game designers
1348000	1350000	Of music so kind of going back to the set list
1350000	1352000	K Rose
1352000	1354000	Says I won't buy it
1354000	1356000	I only like Konami games for the Japanese music
1356000	1358000	If it's localized I'll get a better
1358000	1360000	Rhythm band game like Rock Band
1360000	1362000	Interesting perspective that you know they didn't
1362000	1364000	Bring over anything from Japan so
1364000	1366000	There are folks that like that although I gotta say
1366000	1368000	Though you're kind of a niche
1368000	1370000	Market in that case you know
1370000	1372000	I think it would be nice if somebody would
1372000	1374000	Release a game that has some of the US stuff
1374000	1376000	And that but you're never
1376000	1378000	Going to see a game released over here
1378000	1380000	It's kind of retarded about this too
1380000	1382000	The game only version of this is coming out in early
1382000	1384000	October the
1384000	1386000	Actual instruments the drums
1386000	1388000	And those bundles aren't coming until like
1388000	1390000	Mid November
1390000	1392000	Well Rock Band 2 is the same way
1392000	1394000	Well they're just doing that now because they have the
1394000	1396000	Exclusive for it but it's still
1396000	1398000	Stupid because if you want to try their
1398000	1400000	Unique drums or whatever how many people are going to
1400000	1402000	Buy this game and just go eh
1402000	1404000	Whatever you know I'm not going to buy the drums
1404000	1406000	Now they're stuck with a bunch of drums
1406000	1408000	Alright going back to the Twitter question
1408000	1410000	Are you going to buy Rock Revolution
1410000	1412000	GS68 says I'm too ghetto to bother shelling
1412000	1414000	Out the moneys for it. Act Def says no
1414000	1416000	Because Konami failed to do this years ago and they
1416000	1418000	Should have and they're not even offering something
1418000	1420000	At the level of Rock Band Guitar Hero
1420000	1422000	Gold Anthro says no because if I was going to spend
1422000	1424000	The money for a game like that I'd buy Guitar Hero or
1424000	1426000	Rock Band. Marin Marvel says
1426000	1428000	No it's too little too late for Konami to try to
1428000	1430000	Jump back into the music game business in the US
1430000	1432000	They've already failed hardcore
1432000	1434000	Joosten says all covers in an
1434000	1436000	Archaic interface? No thank you
1436000	1438000	Plus the drums look like ass. Konami
1438000	1440000	Missed the boat years ago
1440000	1442000	I can never say this name
1442000	1444000	Giove Dea
1444000	1446000	Giove Dea
1446000	1448000	I think
1448000	1450000	I got lessons on how to pronounce it last week but I
1450000	1452000	Already forgot. I think it's Giove Dea
1452000	1454000	As DJ Rama S said
1454000	1456000	Only if it works with the stuff I already have
1456000	1458000	Javier Altman says
1458000	1460000	Because we already have enough plastic
1460000	1462000	Instrument stuff. Konami is
1462000	1464000	Too late for their own good. The last Bossa
1464000	1466000	De Sanna has been played
1466000	1468000	Sponge Twang says I will wait out
1468000	1470000	Most likely into next year after
1470000	1472000	The dust has settled. I need to figure which
1472000	1474000	Plastic instruments work with which games
1474000	1476000	DJ Tyrant says depends on how good the
1476000	1478000	Execution is since it's compatible
1478000	1480000	With Rock Band 2 Guitar Hero gear
1480000	1482000	I might pick it up but they are very late to the party
1482000	1484000	And lastly Chad28 says
1484000	1486000	No because they are mostly songs
1486000	1488000	That have already been used in other Guitar Hero
1488000	1490000	Rock Band games and no Master Tracks
1490000	1492000	There you have it
1492000	1494000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
1494000	1496000	And um
1496000	1498000	Yeah
1498000	1500000	So alright well we'll see what happens
1500000	1502000	I mean it's really hard to make an ultimate
1502000	1504000	Decision until the game actually comes out
1504000	1506000	I would just if you're unsure about it
1506000	1508000	Just wait cause
1508000	1510000	You know in the past there have been other games that haven't
1510000	1512000	Performed very well and the price drops
1512000	1514000	Come very quickly so
1514000	1516000	Alright we'll see what happens
1516000	1518000	Alright well let's move on talking about Guitar Hero
1518000	1520000	Since we're kind of on music game news right now
1520000	1522000	Very interesting story being teased this week is that
1522000	1524000	It was the CEO of Publishing
1524000	1526000	For Activision, Mike Griffith
1526000	1528000	He has actually kind of come out and said
1528000	1530000	According to Shaq News that
1530000	1532000	They might be looking at a subscription
1532000	1534000	Model for Guitar Hero
1534000	1536000	So where as you know Rock Band and Guitar Hero
1536000	1538000	To date function with their download content
1538000	1540000	Kind of like iTunes, imagine a system that was
1540000	1542000	More like Napster where it's more
1542000	1544000	Subscription based
1544000	1546000	Apparently 20 million individual
1546000	1548000	Songs have already been downloaded for Guitar Hero
1548000	1550000	Which is pretty impressive when you consider that
1550000	1552000	There's not nearly as much
1552000	1554000	As there is for Rock Band, I mean there's some good stuff
1554000	1556000	And not nearly as much
1556000	1558000	Just it could be interesting
1558000	1560000	If especially if the timetable is
1560000	1562000	Stepped up for the releases
1562000	1564000	What this annual subscription model could do
1564000	1566000	What do you guys think, is the subscription model a good idea
1566000	1568000	Bad idea? I don't think it's a good idea
1568000	1570000	Why is that? Because you don't know what's coming out
1570000	1572000	I mean that's
1572000	1574000	Kind of stupid, who knows what they're going to put out
1574000	1576000	What frequency it's going to be coming out as
1576000	1578000	I mean there might be a lot of stuff that you're not
1578000	1580000	Really interested in
1580000	1582000	I would say you'd have
1582000	1584000	I think the better deal is the way that Rock Band's doing it
1584000	1586000	Where you have a bundle of songs
1586000	1588000	That you can pay for
1588000	1590000	And if you want all of them you get it like a buck cheaper
1590000	1592000	Or something like that
1592000	1594000	Or you know you can buy individual songs
1594000	1596000	Because if you pay like say 60 bucks a year or whatever
1596000	1598000	For the subscription model or whatever
1598000	1600000	What if it's not worth it to you
1600000	1602000	Because all these songs coming out
1602000	1604000	And you have them and you're just like eh
1604000	1606000	What do you think, Dark Sakura?
1606000	1608000	What if for a subscription model
1608000	1610000	If they had it like
1610000	1612000	Okay you know how it used to be like if you did like
1612000	1614000	BMG music or something
1614000	1616000	How you would
1616000	1618000	They had their featured CD
1618000	1620000	And then you could refuse it if you want to
1620000	1622000	And picked what you wanted to order
1622000	1624000	What if they did something to that effect
1624000	1626000	Where they say this is our exclusive featured
1626000	1628000	Track, you can only get it this way
1628000	1630000	However if you don't want it
1630000	1632000	Then choose something else
1632000	1634000	And then also the other thing comes too
1634000	1636000	It's nice that they want to do this
1636000	1638000	But is this actual model built into
1638000	1640000	Xbox Live, Marketplace
1640000	1642000	Or Playstation Network
1642000	1644000	Now we know Playstation Network can do it
1644000	1646000	Because they obviously have their core subscription model
1646000	1648000	And you can pay for stuff that way
1648000	1650000	Why not? There's two MMOs on Xbox 360
1650000	1652000	That have subscription models
1652000	1654000	Fantasy Star Universe and Final Fantasy XI
1654000	1656000	Yeah but those are done through their own individual servers
1656000	1658000	But you still pay for it on Xbox Live
1658000	1660000	That's true, in the case of the
1660000	1662000	Fantasy Star Universe you actually pay for that on
1662000	1664000	Xbox Live, so it's got to
1664000	1666000	Be there
1666000	1668000	They actually have you input all of your billing information
1668000	1670000	Right before you can start
1670000	1672000	VXJ6V comes up with an interesting point in chat
1672000	1674000	Loki you don't know what music comes out in the real world
1674000	1676000	Either until it's about to or does
1676000	1678000	This is fundamentally nothing different from
1678000	1680000	Actual music subscription services
1680000	1682000	But at the same time I mean to kind of
1682000	1684000	But at the same time though it's not necessarily
1684000	1686000	Just
1686000	1688000	I mean what are they going to do? You have to pay
1688000	1690000	To this service to get
1690000	1692000	Access to all the download content
1692000	1694000	Or you're just going to get access to the new stuff
1694000	1696000	Like say if I'm on Rhapsody or
1696000	1698000	You know Napster or whatever
1698000	1700000	Napster's got to have, I mean I'm just pulling
1700000	1702000	This number out of my butt, but Napster's got to have
1702000	1704000	Hundreds of thousands of songs on it
1704000	1706000	Exactly, that's a little different thing
1706000	1708000	Guitar Hero has a bucket full
1708000	1710000	Maybe, not a room full
1710000	1712000	You know what I mean? Exactly
1712000	1714000	That's totally different
1714000	1716000	Unless they're going to start pumping out
1716000	1718000	20 tracks a week
1718000	1720000	Or something like that, then that's different
1720000	1722000	But I don't think they are
1722000	1724000	I notice a lot of people are kind of turning their noses
1724000	1726000	Up as subscription models, but I mean
1726000	1728000	That's pretty much how all MMOs work
1728000	1730000	And also the other thing you have to look at too
1730000	1732000	Are people really going to start
1732000	1734000	Wanting all this
1734000	1736000	Licensed music
1736000	1738000	Which is good, but at the same time
1738000	1740000	With Guitar Hero World Tour now you're going to have
1740000	1742000	All this independently made music
1742000	1744000	All the stuff through the
1744000	1746000	Song creator or whatever
1746000	1748000	That you can download for free
1748000	1750000	So
1750000	1752000	What I'm thinking might work
1752000	1754000	Is sort of, I'm going back to what I was saying before
1754000	1756000	About having the exclusive
1756000	1758000	Subscription only stuff
1758000	1760000	If they have like
1760000	1762000	Certain things that are available only
1762000	1764000	Through subscription and they have their regular
1764000	1766000	Bundle packs that everybody has access to
1766000	1768000	But there's only certain
1768000	1770000	Really good stuff available
1770000	1772000	To people who are in the fan club
1772000	1774000	What about like a
1774000	1776000	Just kind of really going off wild here
1776000	1778000	What about like a Guitar Hero magazine or something
1778000	1780000	Or a tie in with a rock magazine
1780000	1782000	Or something that would come with a CD with bonus tracks
1782000	1784000	Because I'm thinking rock bands kind of done that
1784000	1786000	Like the Xbox
1786000	1788000	What, official Xbox magazine had like three bonus
1788000	1790000	Songs on it at once so you could only get there
1790000	1792000	Well I think they came out for download eventually
1792000	1794000	But a long time later
1794000	1796000	And there was the deal about buying the soundtrack
1796000	1798000	That gave you the
1798000	1800000	Bonus songs
1800000	1802000	Alright well, we'll see, we'll see what happens
1802000	1804000	I mean, new ideas, never a bad
1804000	1806000	Thing to try new things, the worst that can happen
1806000	1808000	Is you fall on your face and fail
1808000	1810000	But hopefully they'll still keep kind of both
1810000	1812000	Options available, but we'll see what happens
1812000	1814000	Who knows
1814000	1816000	Well it looks like Activision's getting something right
1816000	1818000	In the UK and Ireland
1818000	1820000	They're actually stating
1820000	1822000	That there's going to be
1822000	1824000	A bundle pack called the Super Bundle
1824000	1826000	That is for, it's 150 pounds
1826000	1828000	It has the
1828000	1830000	Game, the guitar, the microphone, and the drum kit
1830000	1832000	But you also get a free bass guitar
1832000	1834000	Well, I mean
1834000	1836000	You don't have to at least pay the 50 pounds for the guitar
1836000	1838000	You just have, you just get it in your Super Bundle
1838000	1840000	It's going to be
1840000	1842000	The same Red Octane
1842000	1844000	One
1844000	1846000	That's the Guitar Hero 3
1846000	1848000	Peripheral for PS3
1848000	1850000	This is UK
1850000	1852000	Only, just to reiterate
1852000	1854000	And they're saying that there's a release date
1854000	1856000	Early November
1856000	1858000	So
1858000	1860000	That's pretty, pretty
1860000	1862000	Interesting, I think
1862000	1864000	But it would be available
1864000	1866000	To any retailer
1866000	1868000	And consumers can pre-order either online or in-store
1868000	1870000	I want free stuff
1870000	1872000	It's not fair
1872000	1874000	Yeah, but they're giving them old guitars
1874000	1876000	But it's free!
1876000	1878000	Oh, okay. I give you a kick in the balls
1878000	1880000	It's free
1880000	1882000	Now
1882000	1884000	Yeah, but unlike a kick in the balls
1884000	1886000	Which is somewhat entertaining
1886000	1888000	Sorry, Rob
1888000	1890000	How would you know?
1890000	1892000	I'm a girl, they're very entertaining to watch
1892000	1894000	And deliver
1894000	1896000	You'll never be the recipient of one
1896000	1898000	Exactly
1898000	1900000	But anyway
1900000	1902000	I think that
1902000	1904000	It's actually, first of all
1904000	1906000	It's a good way to get rid of some overstock
1906000	1908000	If that's half the case
1908000	1910000	You could never have too many peripherals
1910000	1912000	I love peripherals, I have a room in my house
1912000	1914000	Dedicated to peripherals
1914000	1916000	You are also a freak in that regard
1916000	1918000	You know what? You've seen the vault
1918000	1920000	No, I mean that with love
1920000	1922000	But you know you are a freak in that regard
1922000	1924000	Whereas I won't even get the fucking drum set
1924000	1926000	For Rock Band, because I'm like, I just don't need any more shit in my house
1926000	1928000	But I have a whole room
1928000	1930000	You know I'm actually getting
1930000	1932000	You have to get a vault, Rob
1932000	1934000	No vault, this is the vault
1934000	1936000	My freaking garage is now an internet
1936000	1938000	Radio station hub
1938000	1940000	There is room here for a drum kit
1940000	1942000	Do not want
1942000	1944000	Pinball machine, yes, drum kit, no
1944000	1946000	You wanna buy our Black Knight?
1946000	1948000	I'm poor
1948000	1950000	The Rock Band 2 drums are actually being delivered to my work
1950000	1952000	On Wednesday
1952000	1954000	Your wife is gonna punch you in the face
1954000	1956000	I'm getting rid of the old ones
1956000	1958000	I'm upgrading, whatever
1958000	1960000	What are you gonna do with the old ones?
1960000	1962000	Give them to my sister, I think
1962000	1964000	Anyways
1964000	1966000	Some other interesting stuff about Guitar Hero
1966000	1968000	And I guess this is a little bit of trivia
1968000	1970000	The Metallica mix of their brand new album
1970000	1972000	Is actually
1972000	1974000	Better in Guitar Hero
1974000	1976000	Than it is on the actual CD
1976000	1978000	In fact, the new Death Magnet album
1978000	1980000	Has been mixed too loud
1980000	1982000	They say
1982000	1984000	And is actually sacrificing audio quality
1984000	1986000	In favor of a louder
1986000	1988000	Sounding product
1988000	1990000	Well, Guitar Hero on the other hand
1990000	1992000	It's actually
1992000	1994000	A little bit more balanced
1994000	1996000	So you actually have a little bit more depth
1996000	1998000	Than the audio in there
1998000	2000000	So a lot of people are thinking
2000000	2002000	Hey, let's just rip the audio from Guitar Hero instead
2002000	2004000	Okay, wouldn't this be a matter of opinion though?
2004000	2006000	No, they actually
2006000	2008000	They looked at the audio
2008000	2010000	They actually ran it through
2010000	2012000	You know, a
2012000	2014000	Waveform editor or whatever
2014000	2016000	And it showed, you know, how they had it
2016000	2018000	Capped in there for the CD audio
2018000	2020000	Versus Guitar Hero
2020000	2022000	Which is significantly better on
2022000	2024000	Guitar Hero
2024000	2026000	Is this one of those things that only like
2026000	2028000	Crazy audio files would really notice?
2028000	2030000	Like, what about
2030000	2032000	Joe Average Headbanger?
2032000	2034000	You know, they get some Metallica CDs
2034000	2036000	They may not care, but you know
2036000	2038000	I actually did listen to some of the portions of it
2038000	2040000	When they were comparing it
2040000	2042000	It does sound distorted
2042000	2044000	Sounds like someone just recorded it too loud
2044000	2046000	But it's Metallica! It's supposed to be loud!
2046000	2048000	You know what I mean?
2048000	2050000	It's supposed to be loud, but you're supposed to turn up
2050000	2052000	Your radio to 11!
2052000	2054000	Okay, you're not supposed to record it loud
2054000	2056000	And then turn it up, because it'll sound all fucked up
2058000	2060000	They should know this! I mean, hell
2060000	2062000	I mean, come on! Hitstun agrees, Hitstun says
2062000	2064000	The CD has mad clipping, and Alpha
2064000	2066000	Kananagram agrees it's too much clicking
2066000	2068000	In our chatroom, chat.com
2068000	2070000	I think they should replace everyone's CDs
2070000	2072000	That's my opinion
2072000	2074000	It's that bad? Really?
2074000	2076000	Well, I guess so
2076000	2078000	Especially when the CD
2078000	2080000	In some regard, the old-fashioned CD market
2080000	2082000	Is struggling to survive in a way
2082000	2084000	This is a pretty big screw-up
2084000	2086000	This is what you get for buying CDs
2086000	2088000	I'm just telling you
2088000	2090000	See, this is what Metallica thinks of you
2090000	2092000	They're all, fuck you guys, we're gonna just record it all fucked up
2092000	2094000	Ah, you bought the CD
2094000	2096000	Now you're stuck, bitches
2096000	2098000	Somehow I doubt that
2098000	2100000	You should play Rock Band or Guitar Hero
2100000	2102000	Alright, well look, if you want to play more
2102000	2104000	Guitar Hero, especially Guitar Hero World Tour
2104000	2106000	You can use your
2106000	2108000	Rock Band drums with Guitar Hero World Tour
2108000	2110000	And this story's kind of making the rounds of the
2110000	2112000	Blogs, although I don't know, I thought I already
2112000	2114000	Kinda knew some of this, but whatever
2114000	2116000	Here's the thing, what happens
2116000	2118000	If you use a Rock Band
2118000	2120000	Drum set in Guitar Hero
2120000	2122000	World Tour, and this is kind of
2122000	2124000	Demonstrated a World Tour preview event that happened
2124000	2126000	Earlier this week
2126000	2128000	Basically what'll happen is that the pad
2128000	2130000	That's all the way on the right
2130000	2132000	On the five
2132000	2134000	Note chart
2134000	2136000	Will actually kind of go over
2136000	2138000	To the other orange pad instead
2138000	2140000	But sometimes there will be some other
2140000	2142000	Logic as well, like if there's
2142000	2144000	Already an orange note in there, it might actually
2144000	2146000	Move it to a blue note
2146000	2148000	So there is, it's not just necessarily
2148000	2150000	Eliminating the fifth one altogether
2150000	2152000	Like, and I think that's kind of where this is
2152000	2154000	Kind of resurfacing in news reports
2154000	2156000	Cause I think the early things we thought
2156000	2158000	Is that that fifth one would just get eliminated altogether
2158000	2160000	But no, those notes are gonna get moved
2160000	2162000	Basically to other drops
2162000	2164000	Which is kind of neat in a way
2164000	2166000	Which is also good for score comparison and everything
2166000	2168000	Does it truly keep everything on the same page
2168000	2170000	Or what, is this gonna be an advantage?
2172000	2174000	Using one controller over the other
2174000	2176000	Because one's four and one's five
2176000	2178000	I don't think it matters
2178000	2180000	But then again I'm not super duper into drums as well
2180000	2182000	Right? Yeah
2182000	2184000	So
2184000	2186000	So I got sent a link to a YouTube
2186000	2188000	That's supposed to compare the two Metallica tracks
2188000	2190000	You wanna hear it a little bit?
2190000	2218000	I've already listened to it
2220000	2222000	Okay
2222000	2224000	Okay
2224000	2226000	Here's the thing
2226000	2228000	I bet you, this is a radio show
2228000	2230000	You didn't get to see what we saw on our screen
2230000	2232000	Which would show you which clips were guitar hero
2232000	2234000	And which clips were the CD
2234000	2236000	I bet you people at home couldn't tell the difference
2236000	2238000	Now granted this show is delivered at a lower bit rate
2238000	2240000	But I think this is one of those things
2240000	2242000	And you can see it in the visuals
2242000	2244000	Absolutely, you can see, look at the waveforms
2244000	2246000	They absolutely look different
2246000	2248000	Where the guitar hero wants to prep
2248000	2250000	But what's the audio quality on
2250000	2252000	YouTube?
2252000	2254000	Not that great
2254000	2256000	So I think you're not gonna be able to tell
2256000	2258000	Until you actually have the two side by side
2258000	2260000	In person
2260000	2262000	It's like, okay, here's an example
2262000	2264000	When Symphony of the Night came out on Saturn
2264000	2266000	Dan and I actually did
2266000	2268000	A side by side comparison
2268000	2270000	Because we had seen one done
2270000	2272000	Online that we couldn't hear the difference in the music quality
2272000	2274000	But when we did it on our TV
2274000	2276000	We could
2276000	2278000	Have them both running side by side
2278000	2280000	Alright, some people in chat rooms say
2280000	2282000	Yes, I hear the difference, it's very clear
2282000	2284000	I don't know, sometimes I think people just want to argue
2284000	2286000	But alright, I'm gonna be honest
2286000	2288000	If I closed my eyes, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell you the difference
2288000	2290000	All I can tell you is the metallica
2290000	2292000	But I understand, I can see the difference
2292000	2294000	Okay, I get the point
2294000	2296000	I get what you guys are saying
2296000	2298000	I heard the new album is mediocre anyway
2298000	2300000	So what do we even care about it?
2300000	2302000	It's just like saying, you know
2302000	2304000	Barney is not in high def quality
2304000	2306000	You know, it's just in normal quality
2306000	2308000	What the fuck, you know
2308000	2310000	It doesn't matter, it's Barney, no one gives a shit
2310000	2312000	Hmm
2312000	2314000	That's my comparison there
2314000	2316000	Alright, well look, not only
2316000	2318000	Do we have that going on in the rock band world
2318000	2320000	That there is the news about
2320000	2322000	How you're gonna use the rock band drums on Guitar Hero World Tour
2322000	2324000	But, hey look, this is a much more
2324000	2326000	Important clip, because
2326000	2328000	Hey, coming to the rock band download store this week
2328000	2330000	Finally
2330000	2332000	After a very, very, very
2332000	2334000	Very long wait
2338000	2340000	The real Tom Sawyer
2340000	2342000	Hell yeah
2346000	2348000	The actual version of Tom Sawyer
2348000	2350000	One of my favorite songs
2350000	2352000	Kicking off the Moving Pictures album
2352000	2354000	Is finally making its way to a rock band this week
2354000	2356000	They swear, and of course, you know
2356000	2358000	Other songs like YYZ, Limelight
2358000	2360000	You know, those are all from Moving Pictures
2360000	2362000	Not a lot
2362000	2364000	Of songs on that album, considering
2364000	2366000	It was kind of epic, and the albums were
2366000	2368000	Only like 7 or 8 tracks back then
2368000	2370000	And that The Camera Eye is an 11
2370000	2372000	Freaking minute song
2372000	2374000	Epic release is very epic
2374000	2376000	And, as if this wasn't enough
2376000	2378000	You kind of get the feeling that this
2378000	2380000	Late delivery of this album was just added
2380000	2382000	On top of what was already going to be released
2382000	2384000	Because you got 6 other just kind of like
2384000	2386000	Kind of potpourri songs
2386000	2388000	Just kind of a hodgepodge mix
2388000	2390000	Of songs from Bad Religion, The Cult
2390000	2392000	Hot Hot Heat, Caspian
2392000	2394000	Caspian, Sleater Kenny
2394000	2396000	And Stone Roses all have songs
2396000	2398000	Coming out this week, so
2398000	2400000	Very cool
2400000	2402000	Very cool
2402000	2404000	I may not get the whole album
2404000	2406000	But I do love me some Tom Sawyer, that was like one of my favorite
2406000	2408000	Songs in the first rock band, and I think the real
2408000	2410000	Version is much better than the cover version
2410000	2412000	I want to get that at least
2412000	2414000	Maybe YYZ or
2414000	2416000	Limelight, I don't know yet
2416000	2418000	11 minute song, do not want
2418000	2420000	Because that will show up in my random playlist
2420000	2422000	Guaranteed
2422000	2424000	So I don't want to get the whole album, sorry
2424000	2426000	Tom Sawyer
2426000	2428000	Is a really, really freaking good
2428000	2430000	Song, that's a great album in general
2430000	2432000	It is
2432000	2434000	Canada knows how to rock, is your proof
2434000	2436000	Alright
2436000	2438000	So, another
2438000	2440000	Interesting thing about Guitar Hero
2440000	2442000	And this has been kind of circling around
2442000	2444000	A little bit
2444000	2446000	Every instrument that G4 hinted to
2446000	2448000	It's not really an instrument at all
2448000	2450000	It's a MIDI sequencer
2450000	2452000	That's right
2452000	2454000	They're going to be adding a MIDI sequencer
2454000	2456000	That will allow you to
2456000	2458000	Import creations
2458000	2460000	Like
2460000	2462000	MIDI files from your PC
2462000	2464000	Into Guitar Hero World Tour
2464000	2466000	As well as
2466000	2468000	Allowing you to
2468000	2470000	I guess
2470000	2472000	At least on the PS3
2472000	2474000	To import different tracks
2474000	2476000	Including instruments
2476000	2478000	Rhythm lead, guitar, bass
2478000	2480000	Keyboards, and drum tracks
2480000	2482000	However on the 360 it will only be limited to drums
2482000	2484000	Due to hardware issues
2484000	2486000	Which, whatever
2486000	2488000	I don't understand what hardware issues they could be having
2488000	2490000	That would prevent them from doing this
2490000	2492000	But whatever
2492000	2494000	So yeah
2494000	2496000	I guess kind of interesting
2496000	2498000	No word on price or when it's going to be released
2498000	2500000	But
2500000	2502000	You're really hardcore into making
2502000	2504000	I guess
2504000	2506000	Tracks on there
2506000	2508000	That actually sounds kind of awesome though
2508000	2510000	I think I'd use it
2510000	2512000	I think it's a neat idea for an expansion
2512000	2514000	You know the results could be iffy
2514000	2516000	But I think that's really taken this franchise
2516000	2518000	In a different direction
2518000	2520000	I don't know how often it will actually be used though
2520000	2522000	Tiger Clawed Chat says
2522000	2524000	I think you could also create techno on that
2524000	2526000	Could you?
2526000	2528000	Could you make different genres of music and stuff?
2528000	2530000	You could make
2530000	2532000	Well I was telling them about drum and bass stuff
2532000	2534000	They said that yeah you can make
2534000	2536000	Whatever to your heart's content on there
2536000	2538000	So you could make a drum and bass
2538000	2540000	Track or a techno track if you're that creative
2540000	2542000	Interesting
2542000	2544000	That's the only thing that kind of makes me
2544000	2546000	Want to buy maybe just the game only version
2546000	2548000	Or something
2548000	2550000	Just to check that out
2550000	2552000	I don't know I'll wait and see
2552000	2554000	So Black Wolf and I are having a little bit of an argument
2554000	2556000	In chat room right now over the last story
2556000	2558000	And he says Rush is the only good thing
2558000	2560000	To come out of Canada
2560000	2562000	And I said wait a minute no no no no
2562000	2564000	Degrassi
2564000	2566000	Hello
2566000	2568000	You can't do that on television
2568000	2570000	He says I still lose
2570000	2572000	Degrassi is not a great thing to come out of Canada
2572000	2574000	And I think you're full of poop sir
2574000	2576000	And what was that show?
2576000	2578000	Out of Control
2578000	2580000	Out of Control
2580000	2582000	That show was great
2582000	2584000	Kids in the Hall
2584000	2586000	And what is that dish
2586000	2588000	With the french fries with gravy
2588000	2590000	Poutain or whatever
2590000	2592000	That stuff is good
2592000	2594000	That stuff rocks too
2594000	2596000	And maple syrup
2596000	2598000	Alright forget it

2600000	2602000	And hockey
2602000	2604000	Alright I think Black Wolf is just giving us a hard time
2604000	2606000	Now he's really starting to argue with us
2606000	2608000	Just for the sake of arguing

2662000	2664000	Forgot that that's actually coming out
2664000	2666000	Anyways Nintendo's been doing a great job marketing that
2666000	2668000	Oh yeah
2668000	2670000	I mean not really
2670000	2672000	Yeah that's gonna be a
2672000	2674000	As good as the DS one fortunately
2674000	2676000	Who knows maybe there'll be an onslaught of
2676000	2678000	Marketing Blitz in the game itself
2678000	2680000	I hope so, the game's awesome
2680000	2682000	It really is better than I think a lot of people are expecting it to be
2682000	2684000	Well
2684000	2686000	Starting off this week in the US
2686000	2688000	We've got
2688000	2690000	The Price is Right coming to PC

2694000	2696000	Coming out on
2696000	2698000	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
2698000	2700000	Wasn't that Price is Right game supposed to be out last week?
2700000	2702000	This is the PC version
2702000	2704000	They may have delayed it from last week so
2704000	2706000	Oh
2706000	2708000	Let's see, same with the Hell's Kitchen PC game
2708000	2710000	So I'm guessing it came out last week
2710000	2712000	Kirby Superstar Ultra
2712000	2714000	On the DS which they actually did
2714000	2716000	Some pretty good marketing for that
2716000	2718000	They had like little Kirby clouds
2718000	2720000	Which is kinda neat
2720000	2722000	And I doubt this is coming out but apparently the
2722000	2724000	Symbol pack, 2 pack
2724000	2726000	2 is supposed to be out
2726000	2728000	I heard that it's supposed to be October
2728000	2730000	And of course you go to a GameStop and you ask them
2730000	2732000	Hey one of the symbols coming at your website says the 22nd
2732000	2734000	And we're like I don't know
2734000	2736000	So the hell with them
2736000	2738000	You can get a box set of

2794000	2796000	Does anyone give a shit about Brain Quest
2796000	2798000	Grade 3, 4, 5, 6
2798000	2800000	Cause I'm thinking we can make this segment
2800000	2802000	A little shorter
2802000	2804000	No we can't
2804000	2806000	By cutting out the games that not a single
2806000	2808000	OLR listener cares about, not a one
2808000	2810000	That is being
2810000	2812000	Biased right there
2812000	2814000	It is completely biased, but also true
2814000	2816000	Hey, we've got parents to listen, who knows
2816000	2818000	Maybe they want to get something for their kid
2818000	2820000	Maybe you're full of poop
2820000	2822000	Something that says, hey look, I know you like games, but I hate you
2822000	2824000	You know, that kind of thing
2824000	2826000	And they might also get them Barbie Fashion Show
2826000	2828000	Eye for Style for the DS
2828000	2830000	There you go
2830000	2832000	Dinosaur King, coming out for the DS

2872000	2874000	Which is a Konami
2874000	2876000	Role-playing game
2876000	2878000	Pipe Mania is a puzzle game
2878000	2880000	Kind of like Pipe Dream
2880000	2882000	And also the hacking in Bioshock
2882000	2884000	That's on PSP

2898000	2900000	My Japanese coach
2900000	2902000	That moved to October
2902000	2904000	So that date's wrong
2904000	2906000	Bastards have incorrect dates on their website
2906000	2908000	Rebel Raiders
2908000	2910000	On the Wii
2910000	2912000	Although that game sucks balls
2912000	2914000	So I wouldn't recommend buying it
2914000	2916000	Lots of stuff this week, I guess
2916000	2918000	Cavella's Dangerous Hunts 2009

2958000	2960000	Well while you're trying to figure it out
2960000	2962000	I looked up cause I was curious
2962000	2964000	What's on that Sing Star Pop Volume 2
2964000	2966000	And kind of an interesting
2966000	2968000	mix of songs
2968000	2970000	Nelly Furtado, Permisqueous
2970000	2972000	Jenny from the Block by Jennifer Lopez

2974000	2976000	Fergie, Big Girls Don't Cry
2976000	2978000	The Sweet Escape, Gwen Stefani
2978000	2980000	And uh
2980000	2982000	I don't know Dark Soccer maybe you'll like this one
2982000	2984000	Rihanna, Umbrella, Ella
2984000	2986000	Ella, A
2986000	2988000	I actually don't like that song
2988000	2990000	I like the remix
2990000	2992000	Under My Umbrella, Ella, Ella, A
2992000	2994000	I only like the remix
2994000	2996000	Alright alright enough of that
2996000	2998000	That's annoying seriously
2998000	3000000	Rhapsody a Musical Adventure on the DS
3000000	3002000	Rob
3002000	3004000	What?
3004000	3006000	Knock it out
3006000	3008000	Can I turn off her mic? How do I unplug her mic?
3008000	3010000	I don't know
3010000	3012000	Pitfall, The Big Adventure on the Wii
3012000	3014000	And that's it
3014000	3016000	Done
3016000	3018000	Finally, alright no I'm just kidding
3018000	3020000	Alright let's look at Japan release dates and see what's coming out over in Japan this week
3020000	3022000	On the 25th
3022000	3024000	The Japanese language version
3024000	3026000	Of Infinite Undiscovery and the English language version
3026000	3028000	Make their way to regions outside Japan
3028000	3030000	Sometimes I get some general
3030000	3032000	Asia release dates
3032000	3034000	Like I said this Friday for regions outside Japan
3034000	3036000	But in Japan you get a game called
3036000	3038000	Janline comes out in Japan this Friday
3038000	3040000	Also Madden NFL 09
3040000	3042000	And Tiger Woods PGA Tour on 09
3042000	3044000	Finally come out in Japan this Friday
3044000	3046000	Because they usually get localized versions of our sports games
3046000	3048000	Just a little later than we do
3048000	3050000	Also coming out on the
3050000	3052000	PlayStation 3
3052000	3054000	Aquanauts Holiday comes out in Japan
3054000	3056000	From Sony Entertainment
3056000	3058000	Also a new headset will come out
3058000	3060000	Madden NFL 09
3060000	3062000	Quest for Booty comes out
3062000	3064000	Again that's an Asia release not just Japan
3064000	3066000	But just Japan would be
3066000	3068000	Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09
3068000	3070000	Going to some of the other systems
3070000	3072000	Taking a look at the
3072000	3074000	Nintendo Wii
3074000	3076000	Bomberman comes out on
3076000	3078000	September 25th as does
3078000	3080000	Disaster Day of Crisis
3080000	3082000	SimCity Creator
3082000	3084000	The simple 2000 series for the Wii
3084000	3086000	The Table Game volume 1
3086000	3088000	So Loki you like the simple series on the
3088000	3090000	Game Boy Advance right?
3090000	3092000	So now they have these games coming out on the Wii
3092000	3094000	I used to check out some of the stuff on the PlayStation 2
3094000	3096000	The Wii stuff
3096000	3098000	I've gotten like a couple
3098000	3100000	But I haven't actually played them
3100000	3102000	They have all the kind of weird stuff
3102000	3104000	I don't play my Zhong
3104000	3106000	So a lot of that doesn't apply to me
3106000	3108000	An interesting looking game called
3108000	3110000	Soul Eater Monotone Princess
3110000	3112000	Also comes out from Squeenix on the Wii
3112000	3114000	So that's a Square Enix game
3114000	3116000	And it looks a little bit like
3116000	3118000	Action kind of mixed with the whole
3118000	3120000	Anime type of cutscenes
3120000	3122000	Going on so
3122000	3124000	Looks like it could be interesting if you're a fan of those types of games
3124000	3126000	That's it for the Nintendo Wii this week
3126000	3128000	Let's take a look at the
3128000	3130000	PlayStation 2 since they're still cranking stuff out for that
3130000	3132000	And I do want to point out
3132000	3134000	Secret of Evangelion is going to be
3134000	3136000	A best hit now in Japan
3136000	3138000	As of September 25th
3138000	3140000	So will Angel Profile that will also be
3140000	3142000	Getting a price reduction
3142000	3144000	But if you're looking for some new stuff
3144000	3146000	Anyway there's quite a bit
3146000	3148000	There's Super Robot Taisen Z comes out
3148000	3150000	As well as Sugar Plus Spice
3150000	3152000	Anoko no Suteken no Name no Kamo
3152000	3154000	Comes out as well
3154000	3156000	And let's see
3156000	3158000	Soul Cradle
3158000	3160000	Well that's another best hit
3160000	3162000	How about this one though
3162000	3164000	Nojizaka
3164000	3166000	Tsunku no Himitsu
3166000	3168000	Cosplay
3168000	3170000	Hajime Mashita
3170000	3172000	That is the game coming out
3172000	3174000	And all I have to say is that
3174000	3176000	It's got a girl dressed as a maid
3176000	3178000	On the cover of it
3178000	3180000	And some of the screenshots from the game
3180000	3182000	Some of the screenshots from the game
3182000	3184000	Topless Bathing Sun Beauties
3184000	3186000	Actually inside the game
3186000	3188000	And Women in Nurse Outfits
3188000	3190000	Sweet
3190000	3192000	Oh the name of it right there
3192000	3194000	Jamie's looking at the name there
3194000	3196000	To see if she can figure out
3196000	3198000	I see Secret Cosplay
3198000	3200000	Secret Cosplay
3200000	3202000	Looks like a lot of fanboy fantasies might come true
3202000	3204000	With that game so you might want to check that out
3204000	3206000	I think it's a fetish game
3206000	3208000	Nice
3208000	3210000	It's Secret Cosplay
3210000	3212000	Coming out in Japan on the Nintendo DS
3212000	3214000	Gobble Gobble Planet
3214000	3216000	Knights in the Nightmare
3216000	3218000	Princess Maker 4
3218000	3220000	Special Edition
3220000	3222000	And a game you might know from here in the US
3222000	3224000	Guitar Hero on Tour makes his way to Japan
3224000	3226000	On the Nintendo DS this week
3226000	3228000	Also lastly
3228000	3230000	On the Sony PSP
3230000	3232000	Taking a look to see if anything
3232000	3234000	Is coming out next week
3234000	3236000	Patapon gets a price reduction
3236000	3238000	Because that game has been very popular
3238000	3240000	Princess Maker 5 portable
3240000	3242000	It is a Princess Maker week
3242000	3244000	This week you got new ones on the
3244000	3246000	PSP and a price reduction on the DS
3246000	3248000	What a week
3248000	3250000	There you have it your Japanese release dates
3250000	3252000	Alright let's get back
3252000	3254000	Into some news
3254000	3256000	After the release dates
3256000	3258000	Well in other news
3258000	3260000	Sorry
3260000	3262000	And this is actually very happy for me
3262000	3264000	Because I love
3264000	3266000	Freaking Metal Slug
3266000	3268000	Don't we all know this already right?
3268000	3270000	I heard a rumor
3270000	3272000	Well
3272000	3274000	It looks like
3274000	3276000	SNK is going to be
3276000	3278000	Doing
3278000	3280000	A high def
3280000	3282000	Version sort of like
3282000	3284000	How some of the other old school games
3284000	3286000	Have gone
3286000	3288000	So that might be cool
3288000	3290000	I just want it to still play
3290000	3292000	Like Metal Slug
3292000	3294000	I don't want it to be 3D
3294000	3296000	I want it to be 2D
3296000	3298000	With very high res pretty
3298000	3300000	Pretty pretties
3300000	3302000	Well I think that's probably what they're going to do
3302000	3304000	Because they did the same thing with King of Fighters 12
3304000	3306000	Yeah
3306000	3308000	But I think
3308000	3310000	A lot of times
3310000	3312000	This has happened with a lot of different franchises
3312000	3314000	Originally
3314000	3316000	2D that they've put to 3D
3316000	3318000	Is that if they
3318000	3320000	Try to like
3320000	3322000	Okay remember the Street Fighter EX series
3322000	3324000	Now I liked the later EX games
3324000	3326000	But they still weren't right
3326000	3328000	Or
3328000	3330000	Fogger going 3D
3330000	3332000	Yeah something was always weird about that
3332000	3334000	Yeah so I think that they would be in their best interest
3334000	3336000	To keep the 2D
3336000	3338000	Or to go the
3338000	3340000	You know what I mean by the 2.5D
3340000	3342000	They're doing
3342000	3344000	You know where it's 3D but plays 2D
3344000	3346000	I'm all for the 2.5D
3346000	3348000	Like what was it
3348000	3350000	Fantasy Zone
3350000	3352000	The Sega Ages one that I have
3352000	3354000	It still played
3354000	3356000	Just like the 2D one
3356000	3358000	It was all cel shaded
3358000	3360000	You couldn't really tell it was 3D
3360000	3362000	Except it would do rotations in some places
3362000	3364000	It gave it a little bit more depth to it
3364000	3366000	I think that they should do something
3366000	3368000	Like that
3368000	3370000	In the high res route
3372000	3374000	Well we'll see if we get more information on this soon
3378000	3380000	Let's see
3380000	3382000	Well in other news
3382000	3384000	And this is actually pretty cool
3384000	3386000	Nintendo may actually have a chance to redeem itself
3386000	3388000	They're actually holding a media summit
3388000	3390000	In early October
3390000	3392000	Supposedly on the 2nd and 3rd
3392000	3394000	This has already been confirmed for Japan
3394000	3396000	But what they're going to talk about
3396000	3398000	Who knows
3398000	3400000	But the event also
3400000	3402000	There's supposed to be a US event as well
3402000	3404000	Taking place in San Francisco around the same time
3404000	3406000	Guesses of course
3406000	3408000	Would be the announcement of Disaster Day of Crisis
3408000	3410000	Since it's already been announced
3410000	3412000	For the Japanese market
3412000	3414000	Obviously since it's coming out next week
3414000	3416000	And for Europe
3416000	3418000	Because it's coming out in October
3418000	3420000	But no word on
3420000	3422000	A US release yet
3422000	3424000	And
3424000	3426000	Other rumors or thoughts maybe
3426000	3428000	That they're going to announce that
3428000	3430000	Conduit's being published by them now
3430000	3432000	Maybe some new games or something like that
3432000	3434000	But we'll have to see
3434000	3436000	Maybe a storage solution
3436000	3438000	Who knows
3438000	3440000	I would like to hear that
3440000	3442000	That would be a wonderful announcement
3442000	3444000	We'll see
3444000	3446000	Well you know it's almost kind of like
3446000	3448000	It was a fanboy story almost going around a while back
3448000	3450000	That Microsoft
3450000	3452000	You've probably heard this before
3452000	3454000	Nintendo
3454000	3456000	What if oh yeah Microsoft's going to buy Nintendo
3456000	3458000	Especially kind of back before the Wii was announced
3458000	3460000	Used to hear these kind of rumors
3460000	3462000	Remember hearing this like oh yeah
3462000	3464000	Microsoft's going to buy Nintendo and they're going to conquer the world
3464000	3466000	Well what's kind of interesting
3466000	3468000	There actually
3468000	3470000	Was kind of a little bit of truth to that
3470000	3472000	And that was explained by Peter Moore
3472000	3474000	Who was talking in an interview this week
3474000	3476000	He actually mentioned during the interview
3476000	3478000	Balmer wanted to know
3478000	3480000	And that was an individual that he worked with at Microsoft
3480000	3482000	Wanted to know how he was going to win
3482000	3484000	For Microsoft
3484000	3486000	How we were going to take on Sony
3486000	3488000	How we would compete with or acquire Nintendo
3488000	3490000	Those were the conversations in those days
3490000	3492000	It was a classic build or buy conversation
3492000	3494000	Interestingly we were just completely fixated on Sony
3494000	3496000	Nintendo didn't even come into the conversation
3496000	3498000	Notice that way he said that though
3498000	3500000	Compete with or acquire
3500000	3502000	Nintendo
3502000	3504000	But now after the massive success of the Wii
3504000	3506000	The world may never know what would have happened
3506000	3508000	If Microsoft and Nintendo had merged
3508000	3510000	Very interesting huh
3510000	3512000	But it might also kind of give some background as to why
3512000	3514000	Microsoft is a little more willing to put some of their
3514000	3516000	Stuff out on DS like Viva Pinata
3516000	3518000	Kind of has that DS game
3518000	3520000	And they're not really competing with Nintendo on that market
3520000	3522000	They really have their heart set on Sony
3522000	3524000	Black Wolf chimes in and says
3524000	3526000	Nintendo laughed at Microsoft
3526000	3528000	They actually did have a meeting
3528000	3530000	And you know when you've got a very
3530000	3532000	Very American company and a very
3532000	3534000	Very Japanese company in that regard
3534000	3536000	It kind of doesn't surprise me
3536000	3538000	You know what I mean
3538000	3540000	So I think sometimes our perspective
3540000	3542000	Might be a little skewed being over here
3542000	3544000	What's just a ginormous company
3544000	3546000	And what power Nintendo has
3546000	3548000	But it's interesting that in some
3548000	3550000	Regards in that way they've kind of worked together
3550000	3552000	A bit
3552000	3554000	Well
3554000	3556000	Other neat things
3556000	3558000	Nintendo of course they only
3558000	3560000	Teased us very briefly
3560000	3562000	During the E3 media
3562000	3564000	Event
3564000	3566000	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars now
3566000	3568000	There's a little bit more details coming out from
3568000	3570000	Nintendo Power
3570000	3572000	And the game itself is actually
3572000	3574000	Going to be a cel-shaded
3574000	3576000	Isometric game
3576000	3578000	It is still going to be M-rated
3578000	3580000	Of course it's still going to be a crime drama
3580000	3582000	They actually had some screenshots to look
3582000	3584000	It sort of resembles I guess
3584000	3586000	A little bit like the
3586000	3588000	Old Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2
3588000	3590000	Just kind of shot a little different
3590000	3592000	Kind of
3592000	3594000	Grand Theft Auto cell phone games that they had
3594000	3596000	But it looks neat
3596000	3598000	It'll be interesting to check out
3598000	3600000	They said that the
3600000	3602000	So as a Grand Theft Auto fan
3602000	3604000	You're interested
3604000	3606000	I'm interested to check it out
3606000	3608000	Some of the artwork looks kind of weird
3608000	3610000	But it'll be interesting to see how the game plays
3610000	3612000	Be definitely willing to
3612000	3614000	Check it out because it's Grand Theft Auto
3614000	3616000	And I love Grand Theft Auto
3616000	3618000	They were saying though that
3618000	3620000	It's going to be a sizable
3620000	3622000	Or the game's going to take place in a sizable
3622000	3624000	Portion of Liberty City
3624000	3626000	The map has
3626000	3628000	Been altered from of course the console version
3628000	3630000	Which only makes sense
3630000	3632000	And the missions will also be shorter and can
3632000	3634000	Easily be restarted upon failure
3634000	3636000	The D-pad is going to be used for aiming
3636000	3638000	While the R button activates in
3638000	3640000	Auto-targeting
3640000	3642000	And there's going to be a subtle
3642000	3644000	Auto-steering built into
3644000	3646000	The driving controls as well so you can
3646000	3648000	Shoe out the window and stuff like that
3648000	3650000	But they're going to bring back the over the top weapons
3650000	3652000	Like the minigun, the flamethrowers
3652000	3654000	And pretty much a lot of the stuff that was in
3654000	3656000	Like say
3656000	3658000	Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2
3658000	3660000	So it'll be pretty cool
3660000	3662000	And it's still due out this winter
3662000	3664000	Which I think January is the month
3664000	3666000	Very interesting
3666000	3668000	I want to backtrack just a little bit going to the last story
3668000	3670000	Because sometimes our chat room is a little behind
3670000	3672000	Because of the delay from when we say something to when it goes out over the radio
3672000	3674000	But kind of a comment on
3674000	3676000	The whole Microsoft Nintendo thing and how
3676000	3678000	Microsoft kind of plays nicely with the DS
3678000	3680000	Tigerclaw gives an interesting comment in our chat room
3680000	3682000	chat.orangelsonshooter.com
3682000	3684000	Microsoft is sort of getting into the handheld
3684000	3686000	Gaming market with the release of the second gen
3686000	3688000	Zune which will play
3688000	3690000	Games so that's true this new
3690000	3692000	Zune thing they got does the games
3692000	3694000	But at the same time I kind of when I first read that
3694000	3696000	I saw it more of a response to the iPhone
3696000	3698000	I'm not so much
3698000	3700000	The DS but I mean it's an interesting
3700000	3702000	Point though it's not that like
3702000	3704000	Microsoft doesn't do handheld games of any sort
3704000	3706000	But I sort of see it more as like an iPhone
3706000	3708000	Type of game in my opinion
3708000	3710000	I have a feeling that
3710000	3712000	If they were to get into the handheld market
3712000	3714000	It wouldn't be with the Zune
3714000	3716000	And if they did I don't think they'd have trouble
3716000	3718000	Passing up the PSP
3718000	3720000	The DS on the other hand
3720000	3722000	The DS on the other hand though I don't think
3722000	3724000	They'll be
3724000	3726000	Well one game that probably won't find its way
3726000	3728000	To the Zune unless they find some way to
3728000	3730000	Have a spin off would be Halo
3730000	3732000	Halo 3 specifically and Halo 3
3732000	3734000	Is going to be getting a new title update
3734000	3736000	And guess when it's coming?
3736000	3738000	Tuesday September the 23rd so maybe by the time
3738000	3740000	A lot of you guys hear this
3740000	3742000	Halo 3 update will be there it's going to be an automatic download
3742000	3744000	You may have to kind of clear out the cash
3744000	3746000	First though before the download will actually
3746000	3748000	Happen there but once you get the new updates
3748000	3750000	There's going to be a brand new ranking system
3750000	3752000	Some changes to the playlist
3752000	3754000	Some brand new achievements which will be cool
3754000	3756000	A complete overhaul to Bungie.net
3756000	3758000	Which is pretty cool and the Bungie.net
3758000	3760000	Website is slowly changing throughout the next week
3760000	3762000	So pretty cool there
3762000	3764000	And I know some of you achievement whores are very excited
3764000	3766000	About new achievements so you'll be able to check that out
3766000	3768000	This Tuesday with the free update
3768000	3770000	To Halo 3
3770000	3772000	So there you go
3772000	3774000	Well in
3774000	3776000	Other MMO news
3776000	3778000	There actually have been some more details put out
3778000	3780000	About Star Trek Online
3780000	3782000	I know that a few of us have been looking forward to this
3782000	3784000	They actually said
3784000	3786000	On the website that there are going
3786000	3788000	To be more
3788000	3790000	Details coming out soon but for right now
3790000	3792000	The ships are going to be something
3792000	3794000	Like naval combat
3794000	3796000	Using traditional MMO game
3796000	3798000	Gameplay
3798000	3800000	Klingon ships are going to be
3800000	3802000	Different
3802000	3804000	A bit more reflecting of
3804000	3806000	Their culture
3806000	3808000	Everything will be very customizable
3808000	3810000	You can modify and customize
3810000	3812000	The uniforms of the characters but they still have to look like
3812000	3814000	A uniform
3814000	3816000	So the options are going to
3816000	3818000	Be things from the show and bring in some new things
3818000	3820000	So it's supposed to be cool
3820000	3822000	And is it supposed to be out in the next three years?
3822000	3824000	That's
3824000	3826000	A long wait
3826000	3828000	That sometimes means more towards
3828000	3830000	The end of that three years so like
3830000	3832000	2011 that's going to be a long wait
3832000	3834000	Whew
3834000	3836000	I hope it's worth it
3836000	3838000	Definitely
3838000	3840000	Well other
3840000	3842000	Fun PC games of course
3842000	3844000	Spore
3844000	3846000	One of the biggest complaints about Spore
3846000	3848000	Of course is some of the DRM restrictions
3848000	3850000	Well EA has heard your pleas
3850000	3852000	And they have decided to loosen them up
3852000	3854000	A bit so now
3854000	3856000	Some of the changes that they've had
3856000	3858000	And of course without
3858000	3860000	You know of course they were
3860000	3862000	Bitching and moaning about having to do it
3862000	3864000	But they did it anyways
3864000	3866000	They expanded the number of eligible
3866000	3868000	Machines that you can install the product on
3868000	3870000	From three to five
3870000	3872000	They will offer ways for you to
3872000	3874000	Request additional activations
3874000	3876000	Where warranted
3876000	3878000	And also developing a system that
3878000	3880000	Will allow the consumer to deauthorize machines
3880000	3882000	And move authorizations to new machines
3884000	3886000	And on top of that
3886000	3888000	As well they're going to allow you to
3888000	3890000	Log in multiple characters
3890000	3892000	Into each account
3892000	3894000	So you're going to be able to have I think up to
3894000	3896000	Five different
3896000	3898000	Players
3898000	3900000	On each
3900000	3902000	Of your activations
3902000	3904000	So that's kind of cool
3904000	3906000	I wish they would get rid of secure ROM though
3906000	3908000	That's the part that's kind of weird
3908000	3910000	But you know at least they're trying to meet you halfway on this stuff
3910000	3912000	I think that's the one component that really still needs to happen
3912000	3914000	Is that whole secure ROM thing
3914000	3916000	But at the same time it's kind of like you know
3916000	3918000	If you think there's going to be no DRM in these games
3918000	3920000	Whatsoever, dream on
3920000	3922000	I mean that's just the way it's going to be
3922000	3924000	This is the day and age we live in
3924000	3926000	This is what they're going to try to do to protect their games
3926000	3928000	Although it still does kind of suck that you know
3928000	3930000	Days before the release and the legitimate users
3930000	3932000	Have to suffer
3932000	3934000	It's just like having a car alarm in your car
3934000	3936000	I mean it's not going to prevent people from
3936000	3938000	Stealing stuff out of your car
3938000	3940000	It just makes it more difficult
3940000	3942000	And it's just like you know the secure ROM stuff
3942000	3944000	And the DRM stuff, it's just going to make people
3944000	3946000	Have to try that much harder to
3946000	3948000	Crack it to be able to steal your product
3948000	3950000	And make it as hard for them as possible
3950000	3952000	Although it's not very hard
3952000	3954000	And it's not
3954000	3956000	Too much of an inconvenience
3956000	3958000	It's not at all an issue
3958000	3960000	It's not as easy as say you know
3960000	3962000	Bob down the street gets a game
3962000	3964000	And there's no DRM and just copies it
3964000	3966000	For all of his friends
3966000	3968000	Well one game that's very hard to copy
3968000	3970000	Because you have to have your own individual
3970000	3972000	Account to play online
3972000	3974000	These are the games that are hard to copy
3974000	3976000	MMOs
3976000	3978000	Unless you have the whole private server and that whole stuff
3978000	3980000	But hey, World of Warcraft obviously
3980000	3982000	Doesn't have too big a problem with piracy
3982000	3984000	Because they've got what like 7 million people playing the game
3984000	3986000	And they are all looking forward to the brand new expansion
3986000	3988000	Wrath of the Lich King
3988000	3990000	Which finally got dated this week
3990000	3992000	November 13th, 2008
3992000	3994000	If you have some war crack addicted friends
3994000	3996000	Expect them to call in sick on this day
3996000	3998000	Because they probably will be
3998000	4000000	Working on heading up to Northrend
4000000	4002000	And some of the new areas up there like the Howling Fjord
4002000	4004000	And trying to level the characters to 80
4004000	4006000	Maybe playing some Lake Wintergrasp
4006000	4008000	Running some of the new instances
4008000	4010000	Leveling Inscription
4010000	4012000	Or their new Death Knight
4012000	4014000	Millions of different things to do in the new Warcraft expansion
4014000	4016000	I'm looking forward to the dance studio
4016000	4018000	Myself
4018000	4020000	You can teach characters new dances now apparently
4020000	4022000	Which is badly needed
4022000	4024000	And also you can get your characters some haircuts
4024000	4026000	So very interesting
4026000	4028000	How you can almost
4028000	4030000	Micro manage
4030000	4032000	Even more
4032000	4034000	That's the last thing our MMO needed
4034000	4036000	More micromanaging
4036000	4038000	Well there's a new add on coming to
4038000	4040000	World of Warcraft
4040000	4042000	And it's Bejeweled
4042000	4044000	Oddly enough this game started off
4044000	4046000	As a third party knock off
4046000	4048000	Bejeweled
4048000	4050000	It was called Becharted
4050000	4052000	And the developer from Willer
4052000	4054000	Actually
4054000	4056000	Kind of made it as a method
4056000	4058000	Of killing time during long raids
4058000	4060000	And farming sessions
4060000	4062000	But apparently
4062000	4064000	PopCap caught wind of it
4064000	4066000	And instead of having them
4066000	4068000	Stop making it
4068000	4070000	They actually
4070000	4072000	Wanted him to
4072000	4074000	Or they hired him on to create a more polished
4074000	4076000	Version of the application
4076000	4078000	That will be released for the game
4078000	4080000	So you'll be able to play
4080000	4082000	Bejeweled
4082000	4084000	And my wife was excited to hear this
4086000	4088000	So now if your wife gets sucked into
4088000	4090000	Getting World of Warcraft
4090000	4092000	Yeah she's just going to be playing Bejeweled
4092000	4094000	And they're just sitting there playing Bejeweled
4094000	4096000	I know
4096000	4098000	World of Warcraft is the best game ever
4098000	4100000	Cause it has
4100000	4102000	Bejeweled in it
4102000	4104000	So no you were telling this on Bobby's show
4104000	4106000	I don't think you told it on our show though
4106000	4108000	The wife is actually signing up for a Warcraft account
4108000	4110000	Thanks to Extifer
4110000	4112000	She's trying the 14 day trial
4112000	4114000	She may actually do
4114000	4116000	A month in 14 days because
4116000	4118000	Extifer wants to get I guess you get some
4118000	4120000	Recruitment bonuses or something like that
4120000	4122000	Kind of like the military or something where you get
4122000	4124000	Like a special mounts
4124000	4126000	Or triple experience or some shit
4126000	4128000	I don't know it's retarded but
4128000	4130000	So she may
4130000	4132000	Indulge him in that but
4132000	4134000	Yeah she's going to try it
4134000	4136000	I have to install it on this laptop that I'm using
4136000	4138000	Right now cause
4138000	4140000	You're that I buy her a new laptop
4140000	4142000	She wants me to buy her a Mac and I'm like
4142000	4144000	Fuck that shit
4144000	4146000	Oh my god
4146000	4148000	I think now the wife is purposely trying to get into
4148000	4150000	Things that you don't like just to
4150000	4152000	Piss you off I don't know
4152000	4154000	I don't think she
4154000	4156000	The thing is you have to know her
4156000	4158000	She doesn't have the patience for it
4158000	4160000	And she's going to quit like very fast
4160000	4162000	I will be very surprised
4162000	4164000	If she actually
4164000	4166000	We should take bets on what level
4166000	4168000	Nellie will quit at
4168000	4170000	How far she gets her character up before she quits
4170000	4172000	I'm down with that
4172000	4174000	What would the bet be?
4174000	4176000	I don't know
4176000	4178000	Like what does the loser have to do
4178000	4180000	Or what does the loser get
4180000	4182000	Or win or get
4182000	4184000	I don't know I don't even care
4184000	4186000	DarkSakura can you think of anything
4186000	4188000	That's not too extreme like no tingle dressing up
4188000	4190000	For a bet like this
4190000	4192000	We have to poop? Well I think everybody does that
4192000	4194000	On a semi regular basis if you're not
4194000	4196000	You might want to see a doctor
4196000	4198000	Alright
4198000	4200000	We'll figure something out maybe make a bet
4200000	4202000	In part B
4202000	4204000	I just don't think she'll have the time for this game
4204000	4206000	Seriously I think she'll probably
4206000	4208000	Level to about 5 and then stop
4208000	4210000	We'll see
4210000	4212000	We'll see
4212000	4214000	Alright anyhow hey
4214000	4216000	Maybe there's some other games that Loki's wife
4216000	4218000	Should be checking out because there's a classic
4218000	4220000	Gaming archive that dates
4220000	4222000	Years and years and years that have
4222000	4224000	Hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of games
4224000	4226000	In it and every week
4226000	4228000	Here on this program DarkSakura selects
4228000	4230000	One of them to highlight here
4230000	4232000	On this program and we call it the classic
4232000	4234000	Video game of the week
4234000	4236000	So what should the
4236000	4238000	Kids be playing this week DarkSakura?
4238000	4240000	For lack of a better
4240000	4242000	Game I picked Snake Rattle and Roll
4242000	4244000	Because I know it's a
4244000	4246000	A game that somebody I
4246000	4248000	Think is great really likes
4248000	4250000	So um
4250000	4252000	Oh me? No
4252000	4254000	I really like it
4254000	4256000	No I put it on there for
4256000	4258000	Sauce although I think it's been a while since
4258000	4260000	She's played it but it was a game that was
4260000	4262000	Made by Rare
4262000	4264000	And it came out on the NES
4264000	4266000	In 1990 it's one of the
4266000	4268000	Earliest platform games
4268000	4270000	It was a 3D isometric playing field sort of like
4270000	4272000	How Marble Madness was
4272000	4274000	They uh
4274000	4276000	Actually it didn't really sell all that
4276000	4278000	Great but it was actually kind of a fun little game
4278000	4280000	It was really difficult too
4280000	4282000	But the whole point is that you are two snakes called
4282000	4284000	Rattle and Roll and you have to eat these little things
4284000	4286000	Called Nibley Pibleys and race to the moon
4286000	4288000	So
4288000	4290000	That's what you play. There was supposed to be a sequel
4290000	4292000	Called Snakes to Snakes but
4292000	4294000	It was never made but there was Sneaky Snakes
4294000	4296000	For Game Boy in 1991
4296000	4298000	And it had a version come out on
4298000	4300000	Sega on the uh
4300000	4302000	Mega Drive in 1993
4302000	4304000	So that's pretty cool
4304000	4306000	I never knew there was a Mega Drive version of this
4306000	4308000	It's kind of neat
4308000	4310000	Huh. Well I like this game quite a bit
4310000	4312000	It's actually a lot of fun. I'm kind of sad we never got that sequel
4312000	4314000	And this is a Rare game
4314000	4316000	So yet again here's another great
4316000	4318000	Franchise that Rare could go back and revisit
4318000	4320000	Someday on I don't know Xbox Live
4320000	4322000	Arcade but I somehow think they never will
4322000	4324000	Which is sad
4324000	4326000	It makes me cry
4326000	4328000	Alright
4328000	4330000	Well it looks like that's it. That's your classic game of the week folks
4330000	4332000	Snake, Rattle and Roll
4332000	4334000	For the Nintendo Entertainment System
4334000	4336000	But also on the Mega Drive apparently
4336000	4338000	Which I just learned tonight
4338000	4340000	Alright on that note
4340000	4342000	We're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back
4342000	4344000	With more of Orange Lounge Radio
4344000	4346000	And yes we're going to talk about Mega Man 9
4346000	4348000	We'll also talk about a new sweet code and game
4348000	4350000	And we'll talk about Project Gotham Racing 5
4350000	4352000	It's all coming up in part B
4352000	4354000	So hey don't go anywhere we'll be right back

4425000	4427000	Rape of people is not funny
4427000	4429000	Rape of monsters is funny

4521000	4523000	Yes, we've been on the air that long
4523000	4525000	To have done 300 weekly episodes
4525000	4528000	You know, and obviously we've missed a week here and there
4528000	4531000	So, you know, it's taken us a little over six years to get here
4531000	4533000	But quite an accomplishment
4533000	4537000	I don't know many other shows, if any, that have gotten to the 300 weekly show mark
4537000	4541000	So, yeah, now we're trying to decide what exactly we're going to do to celebrate
4541000	4543000	We're going to try to get some big guests on the show that week
4543000	4546000	I know that I'm going to try to start sending some emails this week
4546000	4549000	And just have a potpourri of big names on the show that week
4549000	4552000	But otherwise I'm not sure what other surprises we have in store
4552000	4554000	But if you have suggestions please email us
4554000	4556000	Or email me directly
4556000	4558000	You can get all our contact information on the website
4558000	4560000	Anyhow, we've got lots more gaming news to discuss
4560000	4562000	And only a little bit of time to do it
4562000	4563000	So let's get back to it
4563000	4566000	During the break we heard some music from the new Mega Man 9
4566000	4569000	Unfortunately folks on the podcast don't get to hear that
4569000	4572000	Because, you know, the whole copyright and all that stuff we can't offer it up for download
4572000	4574000	But the live listeners did hear it
4574000	4577000	And I believe Loki's going to start us off with some Mega Man 9 news tonight
4577000	4580000	Yes, in fact, if you liked Mega Man 9's music
4580000	4582000	You're going to like it even more when you can actually buy the game
4582000	4585000	Which comes out on the 22nd
4585000	4587000	Or tomorrow if you're listening to us live
4587000	4589000	On the WiiWare download service
4589000	4592000	If you do not own a Wii and you own a PS3
4592000	4596000	You'll be able to purchase it on the Playstation Network on the 25th
4596000	4598000	And if you want it on the 360
4598000	4601000	Well you're going to have to wait until October 1st
4601000	4603000	But it will be available soon
4603000	4605000	And that's awesome
4605000	4608000	Another thing that will be available shortly after all that comes out
4608000	4611000	Is some download content for Mega Man 9
4611000	4614000	And the first new playable character they're going to include
4614000	4616000	Is Protoman
4616000	4619000	And you're going to actually be able to use him
4619000	4622000	Some of the stuff that you get like the rush adapters
4622000	4625000	Actually change to proto adapters in the game
4625000	4628000	And including like the proto sled, proto coil, etc
4628000	4631000	I guess it's all just kind of
4631000	4634000	I'm sorry, it's just crazy that there's download content
4634000	4636000	For like an old school Nintendo game in a way
4636000	4637000	It's just kind of cool, I don't know why
4637000	4639000	It's just really really cool
4639000	4643000	Yes, so that will be available on October 6th
4643000	4646000	For $2 or the equivalent thereof
4646000	4650000	And by the way, even though we can't play the entire Mega Man 9 soundtrack
4650000	4652000	Or so on the live show
4652000	4653000	We can play a little clip
4653000	4655000	So here's what some of the music sounds like
4655000	4657000	Here's a clip from Tornado Man's stage
4665000	4668000	So you can see it has all that same retro goodness
4668000	4670000	Of the old school Mega Man games
4670000	4672000	Like you knew it was going to have
4672000	4674000	And some other cool stuff
4674000	4676000	If you happen to be all nostalgic
4676000	4678000	And love playing Mega Man 9
4678000	4681000	Well, I don't know if you remember that fake
4681000	4684000	Well I guess old school box art they had
4684000	4686000	Going out for Mega Man 9
4686000	4689000	The really human face for Mega Man
4689000	4690000	That was scary, yeah
4690000	4694000	You now can actually purchase the fake box
4694000	4697000	A fake NES cart
4697000	4701000	And I guess it may come with the asset CD
4701000	4702000	That they were handing out before
4702000	4704000	Because these were for press release stuff
4704000	4707000	They had screenshots and all sorts of stuff
4707000	4711000	But they are available on the Capcom store
4711000	4714000	So you can find those at capcom-unity.com
4714000	4718000	And they will be exceedingly rare
4718000	4720000	So if you're interested in getting it
4720000	4725000	You might want to put an order in as soon as possible
4725000	4726000	It's kind of neat
4726000	4729000	Yeah, how much do you think those things will start going for on eBay?
4729000	4733000	Who knows? Quite a bit I'd imagine
4733000	4736000	Anyone in here planning to get that game this week?
4736000	4737000	Yes
4737000	4739000	I think we're going to
4739000	4741000	Jamie of course having a little trouble with her voice tonight
4741000	4742000	Because of the allergies
4742000	4743000	But I think she just said she
4743000	4745000	They think they're going to get it this week
4745000	4750000	I want to because I think the d-pad on the Wii is pretty awesome
4750000	4754000	Whereas the d-pad on the 360 not so awesome
4754000	4756000	However, I love achievement points
4756000	4758000	So therefore I will be getting out of that too
4758000	4760000	Yeah, I think I'm going to be holding off on the 360 version
4760000	4762000	Even though the controller bugs the crap out of me
4762000	4765000	I'm kind of hoping that's one of the things Microsoft is going to fix in 09
4765000	4769000	Based on what we saw at the Leipzig show
4769000	4770000	At least I'm hoping
4770000	4771000	We'll see
4771000	4776000	Anyhow, other games and other big franchises that people are really excited about
4776000	4777000	Suikoden!
4777000	4779000	I know we got a few Suikoden fans in the house
4779000	4781000	A brand new Suikoden game was announced for DS
4781000	4783000	It's not a numbered Suikoden game
4783000	4787000	But a new game called Suikoden Tier Crease is the new game that's coming out
4787000	4789000	And this is kind of neat
4789000	4791000	What's kind of cool about this game
4791000	4793000	Again, the big niche of the Suikoden series
4793000	4796000	You could say is that it's a classic JRPG
4796000	4798000	But you have 108 characters in it
4798000	4800000	There's just tons and tons and tons of characters
4800000	4802000	What's kind of cool about this one is that
4802000	4805000	With the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection now
4805000	4810000	You can actually play where you're leveling one of the 108 people
4810000	4814000	But somebody else can level the other characters
4814000	4818000	And you can all participate in leveling up the different characters
4818000	4820000	So it provides a new way to level up characters
4820000	4822000	And creates a little bit of a community
4822000	4824000	And apparently when they say Nintendo Wi-Fi connection
4824000	4826000	They are talking the internet
4826000	4828000	Not just a local Wi-Fi connection
4828000	4830000	So that could be very interesting
4830000	4832000	I'm kind of curious to see how this plays out
4832000	4834000	So more information to come on that
4834000	4837000	Apparently this was shown at a Konami event
4837000	4839000	That we weren't invited to this year
4839000	4840000	Sad
4840000	4841000	But I heard it was in New York
4841000	4842000	That's probably why
4842000	4843000	Yeah
4843000	4844000	It wasn't on our coast
4844000	4845000	I'm sure it was
4845000	4846000	Oh well
4846000	4847000	They couldn't fly us out there
4847000	4849000	Even though they flew everybody else out there
4849000	4850000	Oh well
4850000	4851000	Not that we're going to be bitter much
4851000	4852000	But we can't really tell you much more about the game
4852000	4853000	Because we didn't see it
4853000	4854000	Oh darn
4854000	4855000	I couldn't play Rock Revolution
4855000	4856000	Maybe have a positive
4856000	4859000	Do you think maybe that's why you didn't get invited?
4859000	4860000	Well
4860000	4861000	No I don't think so
4861000	4862000	But hey
4862000	4863000	You know what
4863000	4864000	If the game stinks we're not going to hold back at the same time
4864000	4865000	It's more important we have integrity
4865000	4866000	Than you know
4866000	4867000	I could have
4867000	4868000	But see that's the thing
4868000	4871000	I'm only taking it based off of
4871000	4872000	You know screenshots and stuff
4872000	4873000	That's not very accurate
4873000	4874000	And with you know
4874000	4875000	Out playing it
4875000	4877000	I can't really give you my true impression
4877000	4879000	But whatever
4879000	4880000	Who cares
4880000	4881000	It's not important
4881000	4882000	So anyway
4882000	4883000	Sweet Coding looks interesting though
4883000	4884000	I you know
4884000	4886000	I've missed out on some of the more recent Sweet Coding games
4886000	4888000	But I did enjoy the ones on Playstation 1
4888000	4890000	So I might have a reason to check it out
4890000	4892000	I think the online component sounds neat
4892000	4895000	So Peter Molyneux
4895000	4897000	He actually of course
4897000	4900000	Has this little game coming out called Fable 2
4900000	4901000	And you may remember
4901000	4904000	There were some games released on Xbox Live Arcade
4904000	4906000	Called the Fable 2 Pub Games
4906000	4910000	Where you can earn gold to use in the actual game
4910000	4912000	Well of course people found you know
4912000	4914000	Exploits and glitches
4914000	4917000	To be able to make a lot of money really quick
4917000	4919000	And according to Peter Molyneux
4919000	4921000	That was intentional
4921000	4925000	And that they're going to be in for a surprise
4925000	4927000	When they actually start the game
4927000	4929000	And of course now there's
4929000	4931000	You know a patch being put out that fixes that
4931000	4932000	And all that stuff
4932000	4934000	Somehow I think he's full of shit
4934000	4935000	To be honest
4935000	4937000	And I don't think it was intentional
4937000	4940000	And I think maybe if you try it with this new patch
4940000	4942000	It will do trigger something
4942000	4943000	But I think
4943000	4945000	If you're doing it and besides you can also
4945000	4948000	You know clear out your hard drive cache or whatever
4948000	4951000	And erase these updates and cheat anyways
4951000	4953000	I don't think it's going to matter
4953000	4955000	I'm kind of curious to see what happens
4955000	4958000	I do claim bullshit on the fact that it was premeditated
4958000	4961000	But I think there is some legitimacy
4961000	4963000	To the fact that something will happen in the game
4963000	4965000	If you cheat it I think they will be able to
4965000	4966000	Enable that
4966000	4968000	Because sometimes even if you buy it
4968000	4970000	Like even if the game had already like pretty much gone gold
4970000	4972000	Or whatever and there wasn't time to add in
4972000	4974000	Something to you know get the cheaters
4974000	4975000	They could patch it in
4975000	4976000	When the release happens
4976000	4978000	Because how many times have you bought a new Xbox game
4978000	4979000	And it patches day one
4979000	4980000	Well I know that
4980000	4981000	I'm not saying something about the game
4981000	4984000	I'm saying that the Xbox Live Arcade game
4984000	4985000	Is going to have to be patched
4985000	4987000	In order for it to be able to detect the cheating
4987000	4989000	Because I think that you're going to try it
4989000	4991000	And you know if you try the same technique
4991000	4992000	To cheat now
4992000	4993000	Now that they have it patched in
4993000	4996000	That it's going to raise a flag or something
4996000	4998000	That's going to cause it to you know trigger in the game
4998000	4999000	If you're that worried about it
4999000	5001000	Just flush your you know
5001000	5004000	Your Fable 2 pub games file
5004000	5005000	And flush your hard drive
5005000	5007000	Exactly just do it offline or whatever
5007000	5009000	And the patch is actually already live according to Zushi
5009000	5011000	Yes it is already live
5011000	5013000	And so I haven't actually played the pub games yet
5013000	5014000	Even though I got them
5014000	5016000	Yeah I played them for like five minutes
5016000	5018000	And honestly they're I mean especially like
5018000	5020000	One of them is just basically a fancy slot machine
5020000	5022000	Which brings nothing new to the table
5022000	5025000	The other one is kind of like a weird version of roulette
5025000	5027000	The pyramid game was interesting
5027000	5029000	But it didn't hold my attention for long enough
5029000	5031000	Honestly
5031000	5034000	I think a lot of people were just getting it to exploit the hell out of it
5034000	5036000	For when the game actually comes out
5036000	5038000	But I don't know what do you guys think in chat
5038000	5040000	Do you think it was intentional the whole time
5040000	5042000	That they intended to have an exploit in there
5042000	5045000	I mean it does definitely kind of tie into the whole good versus evil thing
5045000	5047000	Yeah but it also makes it sound like he's
5047000	5049000	He likes to sound like a smarty pants
5049000	5051000	And just you know trying to
5051000	5053000	Oh I did all this stuff
5053000	5055000	Because I think outside the box
5055000	5056000	I think greater than all this
5056000	5058000	I don't think he thought anything
5058000	5059000	I think it's just a glitch
5059000	5061000	That now they're patching in some sort of
5061000	5063000	Reprecussion if you try it
5063000	5065000	So whatever
5065000	5067000	Big freaking whoop
5067000	5070000	Well who knows if we'll get a new Fable game next year
5070000	5072000	But one game we'll probably get next year
5072000	5074000	Is a brand new James Bond game
5074000	5076000	Right Activision has said that they are planning to put out
5076000	5078000	Yearly Bond games
5078000	5080000	Even though the movies only seem to come out every other year
5080000	5082000	They're going to actually be trying to crank out
5082000	5084000	Yearly Bond titles
5084000	5086000	Of course right now the game they're trying to put out is Quantum of Solus
5086000	5088000	It's actually based on the Call of Duty 4 engine
5088000	5090000	And you know obviously the movie tie in
5090000	5092000	They've got this year
5092000	5094000	But they may do these games even if there is no movie
5094000	5096000	To go off of
5096000	5098000	They haven't mentioned what the genre will be
5098000	5100000	They haven't mentioned who's going to develop them
5100000	5102000	What systems are going to be made for
5102000	5104000	They're going to be aggressive in milking this James Bond franchise
5104000	5106000	For all it's worth
5106000	5108000	And frankly I don't really blame them
5108000	5110000	People everywhere love their James Bond
5110000	5112000	It's not surprising at all
5112000	5114000	They're going to try to milk this franchise
5114000	5116000	And let's face it you know one of the greatest video games
5116000	5118000	On the Nintendo 64 ever
5118000	5120000	Was the James Bond game
5120000	5122000	GoldenEye
5122000	5124000	That game made me so sick
5124000	5126000	But you know sometimes
5126000	5128000	I know there was a James Bond game I played
5128000	5130000	That wasn't necessarily based off a movie
5130000	5132000	But there have been a few
5132000	5134000	Not that they've been wonderful
5134000	5136000	But who knows we'll see what happens
5136000	5138000	Anyway just really quickly I wanted to go over some of the responses
5138000	5140000	Was the pub games intentional or not?
5140000	5142000	James Patrick says
5142000	5144000	Peter M. isn't a typical guy
5144000	5146000	I think it could very well be intentional
5146000	5148000	Game Guru says
5148000	5150000	They should keep the cheat in
5150000	5152000	But have it make you more evil
5152000	5154000	So that yeah you can cheat but it's an evil act
5154000	5156000	Oh interesting
5156000	5158000	So we'll see what happens
5158000	5160000	So
5160000	5162000	If you want to comment on our stories
5162000	5164000	Chat.orangelaunchradio.com
5164000	5166000	We want comments
5166000	5168000	Well this actually is good news for our European listeners
5168000	5170000	Or anybody listening or not
5170000	5172000	But we hope you're listening
5172000	5174000	Actually the Xbox 360 is getting a price cut
5174000	5176000	On the 19th of September
5176000	5178000	The 360 arcade
5178000	5180000	Is going to
5180000	5182000	129 pounds
5182000	5184000	Excuse me
5184000	5186000	The 60 gigabyte pro
5186000	5188000	Is going to 169
5188000	5190000	And the 120 gigabyte elite
5190000	5192000	Is 229 pounds
5192000	5194000	So good news
5194000	5196000	Yay cheaper things
5196000	5198000	And I'm glad you know because Europe
5198000	5200000	Sometimes gets the shaft in a lot of our news stories
5200000	5202000	So it's nice to hear them getting a break once in a while
5202000	5204000	It's just too bad they didn't get it the same time
5204000	5206000	We did but hey better late than never
5206000	5208000	Right?
5208000	5210000	There's a big old rumor coming out about
5210000	5212000	Project Gotham 5 saying now that
5212000	5214000	It's being developed by the Forza
5214000	5216000	Development team
5216000	5218000	And that there could be an announcement for it
5218000	5220000	Next week
5220000	5222000	According to a website called Addict
5222000	5224000	Gaming
5224000	5226000	They have a reliable source
5226000	5228000	That the game
5228000	5230000	Will be unveiled next week
5230000	5232000	And also mentions
5232000	5234000	That this may be
5234000	5236000	This is supposed to take place during the new
5236000	5238000	Xbox experience announcement
5238000	5240000	Scheduled for next week which a lot of people have already
5240000	5242000	Debunked as being false
5242000	5244000	There could be this like 5 hour long
5244000	5246000	Thing on G4
5246000	5248000	I mean granted I can see how they could do that
5248000	5250000	Since there's nothing really plain on G4 except
5250000	5252000	Reruns of cops and cheaters
5252000	5254000	Haven't we already had a rumor about a G4 marathon
5254000	5256000	Of something that got debunked?
5256000	5258000	This is the same thing but this is saying that
5258000	5260000	This is going to be part of that announcement
5260000	5262000	So it could all be bullshit or you know
5262000	5264000	Heaven forbid
5264000	5266000	Microsoft and G4 could have been
5266000	5268000	Lying to us and it's actually going to happen
5268000	5270000	I mean but you know
5270000	5272000	Once again we'll see you next week
5272000	5274000	You know what don't you think
5274000	5276000	I don't know if I were G4 television and I had a big
5276000	5278000	Exclusive thing that I was going to be dedicating
5278000	5280000	You know 5 hours of programming to
5280000	5282000	Don't you think I would have started advertising it like 6 weeks ago?
5282000	5284000	No because if they want to be a surprise
5284000	5286000	Then this was the agreement with Microsoft
5286000	5288000	To keep it hush hush super secret
5288000	5290000	Until the very end you know
5290000	5292000	What's the point of a surprise?
5292000	5294000	I don't know I don't know
5294000	5296000	I'm just saying it's bullshit that's all
5296000	5298000	All I'm saying there's other stuff happening
5298000	5300000	And that may be completely bullshit
5300000	5302000	But there are other things
5302000	5304000	Including I think a story that didn't make
5304000	5306000	It was in show roll but didn't make
5306000	5308000	Our show roll
5308000	5310000	About how they had
5310000	5312000	That new Halo game or whatever
5312000	5314000	Is being teased on Bungie's site
5314000	5316000	And that there's an announcement
5316000	5318000	Coming soon maybe this announcement
5318000	5320000	Could come at the same time just saying
5320000	5322000	There's kind of smoke here
5322000	5324000	That maybe they're going to announce something soon
5324000	5326000	About something so
5326000	5328000	It's still I don't believe they're going to do
5328000	5330000	A 5 hour long thing on G4 but who knows
5330000	5332000	Maybe there's something
5332000	5334000	Somewhere in the middle ground that's coming
5334000	5336000	Just saying cause you know all those Microsoft rumors
5336000	5338000	You know they always seem to come true somehow
5338000	5340000	So I don't know
5340000	5342000	Well some people are very excited about this rumor
5342000	5344000	Acteft in chat says Project Gotham Racing 5
5344000	5346000	Developed by the Forza team do want
5346000	5348000	Could be very interesting
5348000	5350000	I'm kind of I want to see
5350000	5352000	You know what I'm actually more excited about
5352000	5354000	As sad as this is
5354000	5356000	What game Blizzard
5356000	5358000	Not Blizzard
5358000	5360000	What game Bazaar is developing
5360000	5362000	With Blizzard, Activision
5362000	5364000	You know that whole thing
5364000	5366000	I'm curious what the new thing is they're making
5366000	5368000	And I'm hoping you know I'm not as into the Project Gotham
5368000	5370000	And Forza games as much as I am
5370000	5372000	The more simple racing games so to speak
5372000	5374000	You know I'm not like super into cars
5374000	5376000	But I like the more need for speed burnout type games
5376000	5378000	But I love
5378000	5380000	Dumb simple like dumb dumb dumb
5380000	5382000	Simple racing games like F-Zero and Mario Kart
5382000	5384000	And I would love it if they would make
5384000	5386000	A next gen like dumb racing game
5386000	5388000	That's like F-Zero
5388000	5390000	I really want like a next gen F-Zero game
5390000	5392000	Can't you tell how many times have I said it on the show
5392000	5394000	I wish that would be what
5394000	5396000	They'd announce at Nintendo's press events
5396000	5398000	Coming up, wouldn't that be nice
5398000	5400000	Well meanwhile there are other games you can play
5400000	5402000	One of them is Grid
5402000	5404000	It's a game I didn't particularly care for it
5404000	5406000	But hey I do like I do support when games
5406000	5408000	Further extend the life
5408000	5410000	With some extra content and Grid is going to be
5410000	5412000	Extending its life with some new cars
5412000	5414000	And some new events
5414000	5416000	And some new download content that's coming out
5416000	5418000	It's called the 8 Ball Pack
5418000	5420000	It's supposed to be coming out this fall
5420000	5422000	There's going to be two brand new multiplayer things
5422000	5424000	And eight new cars, hence the name of the 8 Ball Pack
5424000	5426000	A McLaren F1 GTR
5426000	5428000	A Honda S2000
5428000	5430000	A 1971 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am
5430000	5432000	Are some of the new things you can look for
5432000	5434000	The expansion will be released for the Xbox 360
5434000	5436000	And Playstation 3
5436000	5438000	It's going to also bring some new achievements
5438000	5440000	Four new achievements, 100 gamer score
5440000	5442000	Of course on the Playstation 3 that would be trophies
5442000	5446000	So there's also going to be some new multiplayer events as well
5446000	5448000	It's pretty cool
5448000	5451000	Not quite specific on what the price is going to be for this
5451000	5453000	Or what the exact release date is
5453000	5455000	But just plan on it soon
5455000	5457000	As in this fall
5457000	5459000	If you're a Grid player
5459000	5461000	Well something else that's coming soon
5461000	5465000	Is the Playstation firmware 2.5
5465000	5469000	That's going to be likely later October
5469000	5472000	And supposedly simultaneously with that
5472000	5475000	It will be the release of Home 1.0
5475000	5477000	So finally the beta will be over
5477000	5482000	And you'll actually be able to participate in it
5482000	5486000	And it says they're waiting for a system software update
5486000	5488000	To the PS3 to deal with this
5488000	5492000	I guess some sporadic network issues
5492000	5494000	That they have with Home right now
5494000	5497000	And then they're going to
5497000	5499000	Reopen it sometime
5499000	5502000	I guess this week for thousands of new testers
5502000	5505000	But in October is when they're supposed to bite the bullet
5505000	5510000	And actually launch this thing that they've been teasing for a long time now
5513000	5516000	Wouldn't it be funny if they just came out in October and go
5516000	5519000	Yeah it's coming out spring of 2009
5519000	5521000	I'd laugh
5521000	5524000	Haven't they guaranteed that it's coming out this year?
5524000	5527000	It doesn't matter. They guaranteed that the Playstation 3 was coming out in the spring
5527000	5529000	And ended up getting delayed through the fall
5529000	5531000	So nothing's guaranteed
5531000	5533000	Fair enough
5533000	5535000	Are you looking forward to trying out Home?
5535000	5537000	No I don't really care
5537000	5538000	You don't really care?
5538000	5539000	I'll test it out
5539000	5541000	I'm excited about Home. I'll have PS3
5541000	5543000	I honestly don't think it's going to be that great
5543000	5545000	I think it's just going to be kind of eh
5545000	5547000	Look at what we can do. We're different
5547000	5549000	I mean great. It's a way to differentiate themselves
5549000	5551000	We'll see how they actually use it
5551000	5553000	Alright
5553000	5555000	Well hey, you know what's kind of funny we're talking about
5555000	5557000	We're just joking around in chat right now
5557000	5559000	And people were talking about racing games
5559000	5562000	And AlphaCananagram said there is a next gen racing game
5562000	5564000	It's called Crazy Woman Driver
5564000	5566000	Also known as Excite Truck
5566000	5568000	And I was kind of like, they should make a game called Crazy Woman Driver
5568000	5570000	But it should be like, not really
5570000	5572000	I'm not trying to say that with malice
5572000	5574000	Obviously I don't think all women are crazy drivers
5574000	5576000	But I think there should be a game based around
5576000	5578000	Crazy Women Driving
5578000	5580000	So then we get the sequel Small Penis Trucking
5580000	5582000	Sure
5582000	5584000	Sure fine by me
5584000	5586000	We can have Small Penis Trucking
5586000	5588000	Fair enough. Fair is fair
5588000	5590000	We can have both
5590000	5592000	Or how about this
5592000	5594000	Great Big Rims
5594000	5596000	Itty Bitty Penis
5596000	5598000	That could be a sequel
5598000	5600000	Would that work for you? I don't know
5600000	5602000	Anyhow
5602000	5604000	The reason why I'm saying that is
5604000	5606000	I'm tying this into a story about
5606000	5608000	The Power
5608000	5610000	Because the Tyra Banks show
5610000	5612000	This is a show that airs during the day
5612000	5614000	And actually I have to admit
5614000	5616000	I kind of like the Tyra Banks show
5616000	5618000	Because in one of those cheesy
5618000	5620000	Over the top type of ways
5620000	5622000	Tyra Banks is a very cheesy over the top host
5622000	5624000	Well do you remember the Wii Fit Girl?
5624000	5626000	I mean how can you forget her right?
5626000	5628000	She was the one on YouTube
5628000	5630000	That her boyfriend taped her
5630000	5632000	Doing the whole hula hooping thing
5632000	5634000	Obviously showing off her assets
5634000	5636000	And it was very controversial
5636000	5638000	Well Tyra Banks had that couple on the show
5638000	5640000	And apparently
5640000	5642000	Tyra
5642000	5644000	Helped this girl kind of get
5644000	5646000	Her revenge on the guy
5646000	5648000	And the guy was actually
5648000	5650000	The boyfriend was on the show playing
5650000	5652000	And
5652000	5654000	He actually had to take
5654000	5656000	His pants off
5656000	5658000	And play Wii Fit
5658000	5660000	In his undies to be a delight of the audience
5660000	5662000	And that was actually the
5662000	5664000	Audience clapping along there
5666000	5668000	And apparently that was done during a commercial break
5668000	5670000	Or something and released as a viral video
5670000	5672000	And in
5672000	5674000	Retrospect it's kind of stupid I mean this story
5674000	5676000	Is like how old like two months old
5676000	5678000	Listen Tyra Banks is trying to be
5678000	5680000	Edgy and trying to be all like
5680000	5682000	She's edgy like 90 days late
5682000	5684000	The only
5684000	5686000	Time I ever hear about the Tyra Banks show is when I'm
5686000	5688000	Watching the soup because they make fun
5688000	5690000	Of her because she's retarded
5690000	5692000	And I don't know
5692000	5694000	But she also was she did something
5694000	5696000	Way back with like World of Warcraft
5696000	5698000	Where they destroyed some dudes CDs
5698000	5700000	Or something like that
5700000	5702000	Yeah you installed the game you dipshit
5704000	5706000	You know I actually walked by at work
5706000	5708000	And I saw that Tyra
5708000	5710000	Was on because they have a TV at work and you know
5710000	5712000	They have different channels on during the day and I saw that the Tyra Banks
5712000	5714000	Show was on and I actually
5714000	5716000	Kind of looked up and I noticed they were showing
5716000	5718000	The YouTube of the Wii Fit girl
5718000	5720000	She was getting ready to introduce her and I was kind of looking
5720000	5722000	At it going this must be a rerun
5722000	5724000	This is like 90 days old
5724000	5726000	No it wasn't it was
5726000	5728000	It was a brand new episode
5728000	5730000	Too little too late
5730000	5732000	Too little too late so you know
5732000	5734000	Late stories I don't know about you
5734000	5736000	Guys but they make me a little bit angsty
5736000	5754000	So this is when we get into the FUs of the week
5754000	5756000	My FU of the week was towards
5756000	5758000	My sinuses my allergies
5758000	5762000	My lungs and lots and lots of mucus
5762000	5764000	I miss having a voice
5764000	5766000	I miss having to eat or drink something hot
5766000	5768000	Just to be perfectly audible
5768000	5770000	And um Rob
5770000	5774000	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
5774000	5776000	That's the only cool part of it
5776000	5778000	Old joke is old
5778000	5780000	Alright Loki
5780000	5782000	Um I guess
5782000	5784000	My FU of the week goes to the fact
5784000	5786000	That I have to wake up early tomorrow
5786000	5788000	Because I have to take my wife's car in
5788000	5790000	Apparently she was driving down the street
5790000	5792000	Or whatever um doing 50
5792000	5796920	year or something and then the car like all sudden stopped accelerating and the
5796920	5800400	check engine light came on then it started accelerating again so that's
5800400	5809160	usually not a good thing so yeah I hate waking up really um my a few of the week
5809160	5812880	goes to something I've been spending a lot of time on lately and my a few of
5812880	5816840	the week goes to Proposition 8 I don't usually get very politically motivated
5816840	5820920	on the show but amen seeing as this is something that directly affects my
5820920	5824760	rights and you know we've done this show for free for how long pardon me while I
5824760	5828680	get on my soapbox for a minute if you live in California even if you don't
5828680	5831840	live in California please tell people that you know that live in California to
5831840	5835480	vote no on Proposition 8 and Proposition 8 is basically an initiative on the
5835480	5838760	ballot that's looking to ban same-sex marriage which is already legal in
5838760	5844360	California thanks just a court decision a few months ago and I believe in
5844360	5848720	equality and fairness for all and you know despite however a person might feel
5848720	5853560	about gay marriage personally it's not gonna hurt you if two guys or two women
5853560	5857160	get married and you know go on with their lives and raise a family and I
5857160	5861440	think it's just I think the whole thing is so stupid and I can't believe that
5861440	5865400	people pour millions and millions of dollars into what I basically see as in
5865400	5870080	this opinion hate when I see people donating money to this yes on a campaign
5870080	5873920	I see hate because that's what it is a discrimination of the 21st century and
5873920	5880920	it stinks ignorance it's just ignorance it's ignorant I mean I know I know I
5880920	5884440	could go on for days no no I fully agree with you it's absolutely disgusting I
5884440	5890080	mean honestly I would love to see marriage made illegal to begin with no
5890080	5897920	no no I understand be strictly reduced to a religious institution separation of
5897920	5901600	church and state have that wall that you know Jefferson intended when he wrote
5901600	5907000	the damn phrase right now and have the government should anyone would think
5907000	5911280	that the government wouldn't love for there to be more married people it's it's
5911280	5916320	good for the economy tax taxes and think of other wedding money that goes in the
5916320	5919260	economy but anyway anyway look I could go on for days and days it's a video
5919260	5924000	game show I don't want to but you know just please you know this is gonna set a
5924000	5928000	precedent for the nation here and you know it's very very important that we
5928000	5932360	defeat proposition 8 on the ballot it just it pisses me off that they lie they
5932360	5936880	freaking lie when they call people they say that if this proposition is defeated
5936880	5940920	the churches are going to be forced to marry that Mormon churches the church
5940920	5944520	that don't want to do are going to be forced to marry that is not true it's
5944520	5948360	straight-up not true look like the Catholic Church actually they're very
5948360	5952960	strict they can and can't marry because they have both have to be Catholic as
5952960	5958040	far as I'm aware and all this other stuff is no you're absolutely right I
5958040	5962600	think it's stupid and ridiculous and those should dedicate a podcast just to
5962600	5966040	it oh god oh I could just go on for days and days days anyway you know what for
5966040	5970360	those folks to think that you know gay marriage is gonna ruin the sanctity of
5970360	5976280	marriage I've got three words for you Britney fucking Spears all right back to
5976280	5982280	video games hug hug kiss kiss I love everybody I really all right Britney
5982280	5989520	fucking Spears that's awesome you know what what that's another pocket we need
5989520	5993680	to do a political podcast someday you know I actually actually and I will go
5993680	5997840	ahead and say this on the air you know cuz you know me I'm very opinionated
5997840	6007600	about my ideas you know Rob I'm just messing but maybe maybe we should do
6007600	6012680	some type of a new sub podcast a political can we should do something
6012680	6016760	called I don't know if Loki's down with it I just like to pissed off nerds I
6016760	6022320	should call the show to pissed off huh I joined the ECA yeah there you get lots
6022320	6026520	of information from them why not maybe you know it's about time people put
6026520	6030640	their foot down and said screw you guys I'm going belly know what I'm pissed off
6030640	6035240	that podcast is limiting my bandwidth to 250 gigabytes a month you know what that
6035240	6037920	is something else to get pissed off that's a different political thing but
6037920	6042960	yeah that is angry I like that idea to pissed off nerds we'll see if there's
6042960	6049000	already a pot there's got to be I'm sure there's one called angry that's 62,500
6049000	6054040	songs at four megabytes per song that that's basically our 125 standard
6054040	6059800	definition movies well you know what I download that much actually I don't but
6059800	6065920	I do monitor my downloading now gs68 says pissed off nerds wouldn't that be
6065920	6068800	under sedation life that's a good point they might already have a corner on that
6068800	6073320	mark they also have an angry video game nerd who's kind of retarded he's awesome
6073320	6077360	that's different though because that's actually about video games awesome any
6077360	6081360	place he plays the games and talk shit about them and they usually are shitty
6081360	6086800	games I'm I don't know what I'm not gonna say my show Nintendo nerd didn't
6086800	6090480	begin the angry video game I'm a fan of independent productions we'll just leave
6090480	6094800	it up but let's do it well so we'll look into it when two twin powers activate
6094800	6097880	will love a bucket explore the possibilities all right video games hey
6097880	6104840	damn it guess what's coming out a virtual console overseas they're getting
6104840	6111680	the master system Sonic the Hedgehog isn't that pretty cool and then some
6111680	6117800	Commodore 64 games Rob Boulder dash do Boulder dash is awesome and guess what
6117800	6121240	there was like a million of those Boulder dash games I know what else
6121240	6126840	jump man cool jump man I'd love jump man why are we getting these over here I
6126840	6131560	played jump man standards I think they had it over here our jump man jump man
6131560	6135360	generous no I don't I know we had those I had jump man junior was the first game
6135360	6139880	I ever owned on my Commodore 64 well jump man if I'm if I'm right this is the
6139880	6144680	jump man that led to us getting Donkey Kong wasn't in a way yeah I mean it's
6144680	6149400	very similar the way they were laid out but the first hero in Donkey Kong was
6149400	6153800	called jump man before he became Mario remember yeah but it's not I mean the
6153800	6158040	games aren't related but I mean the but well they're they're not related in
6158040	6162560	design but they're related in the fact that they kind of are similar with the
6162560	6165320	ladders checks and ladders type of gameplay I always thought that they were
6165320	6170360	related but oh well I just beat me no different design companies one was
6170360	6175280	Japanese one was American yeah um this one says it was a pixie they did um
6175280	6181920	mousetrap didn't they uh yeah they did mouse trap I love that they did but I
6181920	6185440	thought epics did jump but then they did jump in junior um it is epic someone was
6185440	6189360	reading it wrong yeah dead epics did like summer games and winter games it had
6189360	6195960	a lot of great great games on clique of vision that's what I played it on is the
6195960	6199920	clique of vision yeah I got to play a little bit here of just some of this
6199920	6203040	stuff from jump man jr.
6204560	6210400	I know it's jumping jr. not jump man but it's the same same same freaking thing
6210400	6215480	I remember setting it up to go really fast funny yeah you could set your speed
6215480	6218360	in this game that was the amazing thing about it is that like you could have the
6218360	6223680	speed be so freaky fast it was like unreal
6223680	6228160	so where's some actual gameplay noise I love that game oh this game was so
6228160	6234600	amazing sorry we're living in a little dot oh yes you have to avoid that killer
6234600	6242640	dot anyway sorry okay we're done reminiscing uh me too I don't know that
6242640	6247280	was it that was a good virtual console update well it's not fair that they get
6247280	6250520	it there we don't get it I know even though I'm on my little boy I might
6250520	6255600	break my boycott for jump man honestly that's awesome I think that we will
6255600	6262040	though you know I think the tiger class said what the fuck is that sound it
6262040	6267160	sounds like someone jacking off at warp speed it was the sound of him running
6267160	6271120	you have to see that go go YouTube jump man jr. you'll see it funny or what's
6271120	6278600	faster it is it's super slow too you can choose the pace that you want to jack
6278600	6291480	off at a medium pace yeah anyhow oh yes we can only make that you know
6291480	6297960	transition from virtual console the porn anyways so from jacking off to
6297960	6306400	PlayStation 3 news yeah exactly Oh Sony how you make the funnies I seriously
6306400	6310760	wonder if they're trying this on purpose now but apparently the Sony PlayStation
6310760	6318840	3 just launched into the Malaysia region and during their little party that they
6318840	6324520	were you know talking about you know how great Sony is and stuff like that they
6324520	6331720	were introducing different speakers and stuff including one of which is now a
6331720	6337160	pseudo the managing director of Sony Malaysia and he was taken to the stage
6337160	6343400	with a very familiar not Sony related video game theme and it's absolutely
6343400	6348240	hilarious because they were playing the Legend of Zelda theme for him walking up
6348240	6356920	to the stage wow how did they not catch that I don't know but of course someone
6356920	6362560	just get the wrong CD in the mixer maybe that's a really wrong CD wrong platform
6362560	6365920	only that's something you shouldn't have even been in the building right exactly
6365920	6370360	so that was kind of funny they have the video on YouTube you know definitely
6370360	6377720	check it out because it's pretty funny so that is it and of course Kotaku ran
6377720	6382040	the story the or one of the stories is that even the Imperial March would have
6382040	6388440	been a better choice all right well every week on this program we like to
6388440	6392360	give you a chance to give us some feedback not just through the chat room
6392360	6395720	at chat.org.com or the phone calls which we'll get to later but through our mail
6395720	6399000	bag and every week you guys send us emails and we pick a few of them to read
6399000	6402040	on the show or in tonight's case we're probably gonna read a lot of them on the
6402040	6410600	show tonight actually it's a statement we call the OLR mailbag
6410600	6415360	wrong thing I know but I felt like singing anyway by the way I know I still
6415360	6420800	do that when I hear it I still hear it in my head. You've ruined me Rob, you've ruined me.
6420800	6425080	usually dark soccer reads the emails but as you know she's a little bit under the
6425080	6428440	weather tonight thanks to stuff in the air so I will be taking over since my
6428440	6431960	voice seems to be in good shape even though I was shouting most of the day
6431960	6436880	gay or straight no on eight anyway moving on we're gonna start off with an
6436880	6441800	email from Robway it's Rob with two B's I just got infinite undiscovery I noticed
6441800	6446520	the action RPG fights a lot like say Kingdom Hearts could this be an initial
6446520	6453040	run with a new RPG engine any thoughts hmm interesting theory but would Kingdom
6453040	6456720	Hearts be on the 360 I don't think so an infinite of discovery I think is a 360
6456720	6460880	exclusive but it would be a killer exclusive but I think most people have
6460880	6463680	kind of already chalked up the fact that in the rumors are saying the Kingdom
6463680	6467040	Hearts is gonna be on the 360 but if you remember they don't be on PlayStation
6467040	6470320	3 if you remember they develop all their games on PC so it wouldn't matter
6470320	6474360	anyway true so you know yeah absolutely it could be a cross-platform thing but
6474360	6478520	just something to think about by the way he also wants to add a PS if you haven't
6478520	6482920	yet played the game early on in the game is a village called new land this is
6482920	6486640	spoiler free don't worry in order to ensure you don't have to restart the
6486640	6491600	game save the game as soon as you find the save point do not overwrite that
6491600	6496440	save until you have completed the task they're a tip from Rob with two B's that
6496440	6500960	might save some of you guys some headaches we have another question here
6500960	6505920	this individual did not sign their email but I think it's spasnator because I see
6505920	6508480	it in the email address even though I'm not gonna give the whole email address
6508480	6511740	but we'll just say that hi folks I have some questions for you again I hope you
6511740	6515120	don't mind that most of them are of a semi quasi political in nature hey no
6515120	6518800	that's okay we're kind of on a political tangent tonight one given that we're
6518800	6522080	experiencing all this economic turmoil do you see this affecting the video game
6522080	6526340	industry in any way shape or form what do you guys think with the reset with
6526340	6531440	the current economy situation affect the video game industry well it's a lot of
6531440	6537480	banks that are going poor so it's not like I mean people really aren't seeing
6537480	6540440	a lot of people becoming poor because of the situation that's going on right now
6540440	6545720	unless I guess you're you own a bank and in which case you probably before but no
6545720	6550040	I don't think it's gonna affect anything if this continues on for a few years or
6550040	6553360	something like that then yeah it's gonna be bad and probably people will be more
6553360	6558400	conservative with their game spending so they won't buy as much in my opinion and
6558400	6562560	this is only the dumbest answer in some ways yes in some ways no yes because
6562560	6566040	people have less disposable income and video games are funded by disposable
6566040	6570400	income but no because video games are a global market not just made for the US
6570400	6573200	so I don't think they're necessarily gonna stop developing games because they
6573200	6575800	still sell in Japan they still sell in Europe and other countries and it might
6575800	6579120	not be experiencing the same thing we're experiencing so something to think about
6579120	6582680	number two with the election coming up not too long from now and given the fact
6582680	6587000	that both Obama and McCain are in a virtual tie currently in polls do you
6587000	6590600	think either one of them will reach out to gamers seeing as a good chunk of the
6590600	6595200	population or gamers most of which are old enough to vote honestly you want my
6595200	6600840	honest answer no because unfortunately there's still that stigma in the the
6600840	6604440	place out there and I'm not reading from the email this is my off the top of my
6604440	6609300	head I say no because there's still a big negative aura that goes with video
6609300	6613800	games thanks to people like Jack Voldemort and people that you know video
6613800	6617280	games are bad and bloody and violent and you know it's that old mentality that
6617280	6621040	Dungeons & Dragons makes people kill people in real life unfortunately that's
6621040	6624600	still around so unfortunately I don't think you're ever gonna see Obama McCain
6624600	6629120	siding with the gamers in that respect because I think it would for them sadly
6629120	6633960	would do more harm than good and it's sad don't get me wrong but that's why
6633960	6637680	it's important that gamers you know that's why things like ECA and so on are
6637680	6642120	important because gamers get a voice then gamers get their political clout
6642120	6647480	known etc etc this one isn't so much a question back to the email as it is a
6647480	6650540	random idea or thought I had and would like to have you guys be my sounding
6650540	6653560	board do you think it may be a decent idea if sometime down the road there was
6653560	6657400	a political post either on a volunteer basis or salaried that had two functions
6657400	6660960	advise the president on all things video game entertainment related and also did
6660960	6663920	some public education on video games basically dispelling myths
6663920	6667800	misconceptions stereotypes and anything Jack douchebag says about video games I
6667800	6671240	was thinking that if something like this was in place perhaps things will
6671240	6676120	eventually simmer down something like it is in place it's called the ECA it's
6676120	6679920	just not officially government sanctioned but that's you know you're on
6679920	6682560	the right track with what you're thinking about but again for the same
6682560	6685560	reasons I stated before you're not going to see the government just start to
6685560	6689520	embrace video games like that you know what I mean but I think what you're
6689520	6693480	talking about that's the type of thing that the ECA is looking to bring
6693480	6697600	awareness to so check it out if you haven't already because I think they're
6697600	6704080	looking for politically minded people like you agree disagree I think so all
6704080	6709360	right that was and I think so all right moving on to the next email this is from
6709360	6716440	I am a B hi olr I was wondering if you guys are still going to do pyramid head
6716440	6720520	rape appreciation day and if so when is it anyways keep up the great work and I
6720520	6724000	hope to see you guys in future cons you know I'm afraid we may have missed it I
6724000	6726920	forgot completely about it we haven't missed the other game hasn't come out
6726920	6729920	yet it's moved so I thought it was supposed to be the day after Silent Hill
6729920	6735240	2's release no I think we were doing this just to make it easy the release of
6735240	6738600	Silent Hill homecoming doesn't homecoming come out in like two weeks
6738600	6741960	yeah it's on the 30th see I always thought oh it's it's almost around that
6741960	6746640	same time anyway because September 25th so that would be like in four days what
6746640	6750520	is it yeah it's like the day no I'm sorry September 24th the Wednesday so
6750520	6753600	her 24th was the day that it was originally released on the PlayStation
6753600	6758080	2 in 2001 I just I don't know if it would be yeah just do it on the 30th it
6758080	6763680	makes it easy or for Halloween you know I don't think we have any officially run
6763680	6768580	events this year but I think what you should do you should if it's go see
6768580	6772160	the hard thing is I don't want to say run out by Silent Hill homecoming
6772160	6776080	because I don't know it might suck so what you should do is play a Silent Hill
6776080	6779800	game yeah play a Silent Hill game like Silent Hill 2 that's really good and
6779800	6783120	then wait for our review I'm after the game comes out and if it's good you'll
6783120	6786720	buy that too and that's how you can praise pyramid head but if you do want
6786720	6790320	to take little pictures of pyramid heads and send them in to us or creative
6790320	6795240	pyramid head usage in public then I would love to run them on the front page
6795240	6800160	of our site I think that would be fun so maybe just kind of like a general end of
6800160	6805520	September time frame I don't know about having a rape appreciation day people
6805520	6810120	would like that too much but the only rape of monsters remember not rape of
6810120	6822640	humans all right let's go on to another email that comes from see it's not

6858640	6864280	who I've never exchanged a message with or anything so yeah send me a message if
6864280	6867200	you want but instead of giving you the gamer tags out over the air we're gonna
6867200	6871600	make it work for it so I head on over the forums and check that out or listen
6871600	6877280	to a previous episode where we did give give it out I think there was one other
6877280	6880720	email I wanted to read here and we're not gonna be able to get to all the
6880720	6883000	emails this week but I think we'll read this one and this will be the last one
6883000	6888200	tonight and it comes to us from Dan shadow hey guys Dan shadow here hope you
6888200	6891880	all had a great talk like a pirate day this last Friday I had my fair share of
6891880	6897440	grog I can tell you that hmm talk like a pirate day did you guys do anything to
6897440	6902920	celebrate I said our once I didn't are like a pirate you acted like one though
6902920	6908240	yeah I think I posted on my Twitter hey zero day leet where's coming to my site
6908240	6914440	check it out dudes that was my talk like a pirate thing some some things have
6914440	6917880	been on my mind lately it seems the only way developers can move forward is to
6917880	6922000	move laterally we have been seeing games adopt aspects of other genres to fix
6922000	6925320	some of their problems this has been incredibly popular so far look at look
6925320	6929000	Grand Theft Auto for instance when this game was went 3d all they did was to
6929000	6932800	take a crappy driving game with a crappy shooter put you in the big world to play
6932800	6936440	in it seems to me that if there's an abundance of things to do people will
6936440	6941560	overlook the quality of the gameplay retort not necessarily I think the
6941560	6945360	driving is good in it and it's not really a crappy game now however they're
6945360	6948880	crappy minigames that they threw in there like crappy bowling crappy darts
6948880	6954680	and crappy billiards yes that does suck and that does feel very tacked on and
6954680	6961760	this crappy but the game itself fun do you think that it's a so you don't think
6961760	6964560	it's a crappy shooter and crapping driving game kind of no not all I think
6964560	6967760	they I mean having played some of the other multiplayer Grand Theft Auto games
6967760	6972520	which were only on PSP unfortunately they fixed a lot of things there's a lot
6972520	6977160	of things they haven't fixed but you know they each have their own little
6977160	6982160	nuances my problem with Grand Theft Auto is now that I've finished the game
6982160	6986560	unless I play multiplayer there's not much for me to do in it it's not really
6986560	6993640	fun anymore there's not a lot of I don't know fun things to do in it I
6993640	6998440	guess I have more to this email from Dan shadow I just wonder if the developers
6998440	7001840	are having problems with moving a genre forward without having to distract the
7001840	7005760	gamer with aspects of more popular games this work so far but I don't want to see
7005760	7009960	RPG elements in every single game nor do I want to have a driver in my RPG on the
7009960	7013320	surface you'll see big-time shooters that are hardcore on the surface once
7013320	7016440	you go online you're riddled with customization experience points and
7016440	7020320	guild systems where do you think the genres are going do you think there's
7020320	7025880	room for more than one great single genre game each year yes but you know
7025880	7029760	what the problem is I think and thanks for your mouth I think a big prior the
7029760	7034920	problem is that because of the way like Christmas is a lot of games get
7034920	7038560	overlooked because they all come out between September to December I think
7038560	7041760	more great games we get recognized if they would learn how to evenly space
7041760	7045640	them out throughout the years starting to get that I I think a little bit yes
7045640	7049240	but my god I feel overwhelmed right now with all the games I want to play I mean
7049240	7054640	really the other thing too also is that I mean what they're trying to do is
7054640	7058920	attract more people to their game and the problem is if they keep putting out
7058920	7062480	the same game and not trying to incorporate these little elements that
7062480	7066000	maybe will attract an RPG player or maybe we'll attract someone who's really
7066000	7071920	into bowling or something that's really what they're trying to do to get they're
7071920	7074560	kind of trying to branch out a little bit I think the real problem comes down
7074560	7079440	to these companies but not games that aren't finished or aren't working
7079440	7084880	correctly or haven't been properly bug tested or anything I mean seriously
7084880	7089080	mercenaries to what the fuck that game is not done there is no way that they
7089080	7093720	can say oh yeah we've ironed out all the bugs in that one no they did not in fact
7093720	7096760	they probably will just look at it figure out what's wrong with it and then
7096760	7100360	later on they can go patch it because it made better business sense for them at
7100360	7103600	the time to release it when they did because there wasn't a lot coming out
7103600	7106640	around then and they figure they're gonna get a lot more sales that way at
7106640	7111200	the same time people say their game is shit interesting comment from Xenocore
7111200	7115320	in our chat room the problem is the same reason we all have these big-budget games
7115320	7120800	too many suits in the industry I'm kind of curious to see what XNA is gonna do
7120800	7123360	to all this you know you know I keep talking about I really think this is
7123360	7126120	gonna be a big freaking deal and I know I make a big deal about it on the show
7126120	7130680	but come on I mean it is a distribution platform for independent games to really
7130680	7135480	get noticed I'm very curious to see what this does to gaming if anything I could
7135480	7139120	be wrong it could have the impact of just a little pebble I think if they do
7139120	7142720	anything right they could be a big volcano too and I hate to say this like
7142720	7147360	the Apple App Store where a lot of people putting stuff on there and it
7147360	7151120	spreads like wildfire really quick and that's part of the reason why sorry
7151120	7155960	Logie but the iPhone is murdering is because you don't see that type of in
7155960	7159760	enabling on other phones that are out there like the instinct and all those
7159760	7163280	other things you know I'm and I'm sure some angry emailer who's anti Apple and
7163280	7165600	pro sprint or whatever's gonna email me telling me about things I'm not
7165600	7170320	considering but whatever Apple's doing a great job marketing their marketplace
7170320	7173920	and getting it out there that you know any idiot can make these applications
7173920	7177240	that you know some of them are very exciting like you know the whole built
7177240	7183280	in Twitter and you know just everything they've got it's great so that's part of
7183280	7187320	why the iPhones kicking a lot of button why everybody really wants one well not
7187320	7190240	everybody but a lot of people all right that was it for mailbag hey why don't
7190240	7193200	you send us an email for consideration to be read up next week mailbag at
7193200	7196760	orange laundry calm very sorry to those emails we didn't get to this week just
7196760	7200320	realized we didn't run out of time but we did read them all and we lulled at
7200320	7203840	your improper grammar just kidding but we also praised you when you had good
7203840	7209560	grammar let's get back some gaming news Loki yes well the big trend now is to
7209560	7214280	release movies based on games release talk about it so of course the next game
7214280	7219320	that they're talking about making a movie for would be Mass Effect and
7219320	7227680	apparently AV Arad I guess the guy behind a bunch of good comic book movie
7227680	7236160	franchises is has been rumored to be or to have optioned the game for movie so
7236160	7241320	we'll have to see if this actually ends up happening because you know like other
7241320	7250800	games like Halo it doesn't end up coming out so yeah I think great let's see if
7250800	7254960	there's a good quality movie made here but unfortunately so far track record
7254960	7262480	hasn't been too favorable I am I do have a little bit of I guess moderately high
7262480	7267920	hopes for Max Payne because that looks kind of cool and hit man I guess wasn't
7267920	7274360	that bad but I didn't see it so I can't really judge was not good well if one
7274360	7277760	movie wasn't enough there's another movie coming out is coming out in Germany
7277760	7283440	why Germany because that's right the man who brought you postal among with other
7283440	7288400	great cinematic fair label has made a new movie it's called far cry yippie
7288400	7293360	skippy and it's getting its German premiere on October 2nd so expect the
7293360	7300520	first reviews to hit the internet around them I call it a far cry from good now
7300520	7305040	now you can't hate it until you've seen it no I can hate it because it's doable
7305040	7311400	or available and yes his track record speaks for himself I'm sorry I'm waiting
7311400	7316200	for the fluke to happen where all sudden it's just cinematic you know mastery but
7316200	7320800	it's not it's really not going to be good by the way I'm Tiger Claw reminds
7320800	7323860	me of something I read on the internet this week he says oh speaking of label
7323860	7327480	he's also coming out with his own video games you hear about that yeah tunnel
7327480	7331840	rats when we interviewed him he actually talked about that a little bit I think
7331840	7336680	it's supposed to come out like next year and they had a trailer for the game which
7336680	7342360	looks okay I guess it looked kind of boring but the graphics were all right
7342360	7348040	because if ruining one entertainment genre wasn't enough or Zach deft calls
7348040	7353680	him way balls he really just he needs to find his niche that he's good at
7353680	7358200	obviously games aren't it and he just really wants to use games because it's
7358200	7365200	an excuse about meditating far away from here what's his name talking well he
7365200	7369080	just wants to make genre films but it's like kind of like oh I just want to play
7369080	7372740	around with making movies you know he's not even really that serious about it
7372740	7379920	frisbee suggests in chat room the wonderfully mature name of boob way balls
7380280	7383920	why not we give new people we give people new names on this show all the
7383920	7388880	time maybe we should officially call him boo boy balls you know what what why do
7388880	7393880	we give him press I don't know because sometimes you can't help it's like a
7393880	7398280	train wreck you know you don't want to look but you can't help but turn your
7398280	7402200	head and go because I wonder how bad it is because we have to warn people
7402200	7406440	because there are some people that are like ooh Far Cry Far Cry video game
7406440	7412720	movie you know sadly enough the thing is you know obviously we can't reach a lot
7412720	7416320	of people but the people that listen to us can reach their friends and their
7416320	7419760	friends will reach their friends and eventually more these movies will make
7419760	7423920	it less into the theaters more direct-to-video and less people will buy
7423920	7429240	them because unfortunately these sell like crazy on DVD and I don't know why
7429240	7432200	because people apparently are stupid well people like their bad movie
7432200	7438040	collection it's MST 3k syndrome right exactly it is I'm actually wanting to
7438040	7441120	know if the any of those riff tracks have been done to a new a bowl film
7441120	7447440	because I bet that would be funny anyway awesome moving on um for people who are
7447440	7453200	Sega fans like myself there are actually going to be a new game coming out it's
7453200	7459000	Harley Davidson king of the road and you know they did Harley Davidson in LA
7459000	7467680	writers not too long ago well like ten years ago but now they're going to have
7467680	7475720	it on a full-size Harley on a 62 inch screen and it's gonna have a very 70s
7475720	7483320	rock soundtrack with Deep Purple and Steppin Wolf and it's on display it was
7483320	7489720	on display the Tokyo amusement show so I want awesome
7489720	7494760	very cool uh Harley games that could be kind of awesome it could also be kind of
7494760	7501840	bad but hopefully not yeah I was gonna say there was another arcade game that
7501840	7505560	was supposed to be coming out that didn't make our show roll but uh
7505560	7511720	elevator action was getting a new arcade game with an actual elevator door on the
7511720	7518560	arcade cabinet nice and it's now a shooter game which is interesting so
7518560	7523960	kind of cool anyways another thing that's getting changed a little bit is
7523960	7528320	Animal Crossing for the Wii the name is actually changed a little bit in
7528320	7532960	Australia for some reason apparently city folk is not welcome in Australia
7532960	7539600	but let's go to the city is so Animal Crossing shall now be known as Animal
7539600	7547040	Crossing let's go to the city in Australia make it so why I don't know
7547040	7551720	that's the question of the day like is is I gotta know Australian folks is is
7551720	7555760	fault did I just insult you by saying folk I mean that's what I want to know
7555760	7561760	that's I'm very very curious about what is it so in insulting about city folk
7561760	7569360	folk you rub I don't think that's it I don't know the other thing I was gonna
7569360	7572360	say well I mean they've done this in the past with other games I mean another
7572360	7577960	perfect example would be in the Asian region Africa is no longer known as
7577960	7583360	Africa it's known as a kuna matata kuna matata I love it do we talk about that
7583360	7587160	last week yes we did Oh God that's a great now see if they'd called the game
7587160	7592440	that originally I would be all over that you know what I mean we wouldn't I was a
7592440	7596440	game coming I'll call her kuna matata how wondering if they don't do that
7596440	7603840	because Disney would be like you're sued yeah Disney will sue Xenocore says it's
7603840	7607960	now known as Jumbo Safari that's why they're gonna sell more copies of it I
7607960	7612480	wish I wish alright well one more story for you guys then we're gonna open up
7612480	7616560	our skype line and you can call us at orange lounge radio on skype or our
7616560	7620400	phone number one eight seven seven game olr and this is a story about EA
7620400	7625040	Microsoft and GameStop what did these three companies have in common well they
7625040	7630160	were recently awarded perfect scores for the treatment of gay lesbian bisexual
7630160	7635080	and transgender employees and that's by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and
7635080	7641760	it's all in the 2009 corporate equity index here's a comment on this from game
7641760	7646600	politics comm a comment from the president of the HRC Foundation Joel
7646600	7651600	soul Moness the 2009 corporate equality index shows that corporate America
7651600	7655400	understands that a diverse workforce is critical to remaining successful and
7655400	7658360	competitive in the absence of a federal law that prohibits workplace
7658360	7661360	discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or
7661360	7665400	expression it is up to employers to take the lead and implement policies that
7665400	7669800	ensure all of their employees are protected game related companies which
7669800	7675760	also receive perfect scores include retailers Best Buy and Target PC Dell HP
7675760	7685520	Intel eBay Google Yahoo and Apple so nice very nice you know it's it's kind
7685520	7689240	of sad but you know you might be thinking well why is this news because
7689240	7693680	sadly there are some companies out there where it's okay to discriminate based on
7693680	7698840	that stuff and it's time to get out of your cave and really to be honest it's
7698840	7705640	GameStop they just treat everyone like shit so but at least at least it's fair
7705640	7710040	everybody is treated everybody is treated like shit so at least it's it's
7710040	7713840	non-discriminatory that's the important thing and I'm fine with that as long as
7713840	7717520	everybody's treated like shit all right anyway we're gonna treat you like shit
7717520	7721880	now when you call us at Orson's radio on Skype or our phone number one eight
7721880	7727200	seven seven game olr just kidding we won't treat you like shit unless you
7727200	7730600	deserve it meanwhile while we wait for some calls you have any last-minute
7730600	7737520	stories Loki yes I do have a few some stuff that I didn't make our show roll
7737520	7743980	this week apparently there was a ISO loader being in development for the
7743980	7750080	homebrew community much to the dislike of the homebrew community and the
7750080	7757080	developer when it cocoa apparently it got leaked out which is not good and now
7757080	7761160	the developer said you didn't get the full version then so fuck you all
7761160	7763960	yikes alright let's go to the phone real quick we'll come back to the story how
7763960	7767720	you're on orange on radio is this you know what up guys it's in a corporate
7767720	7768520	quest
7768520	7773000	hey Zina core from ultimate quest what is on your mind my friend a few things
7773000	7776880	first of all ducked a new Knight Rider for public safety type thing you know
7776880	7781040	that get that get that get that did that premiere tonight or something
7781040	7785440	no but I caught it on Hulu and that's it's like how many sharks can you jump
7785440	7792840	in one show my god record or something it doesn't know how to do the show no
7792840	7796720	hassle Hoff equals instant fail I mean it doesn't take a genius to recognize
7796720	7802480	that the only cool thing I liked in there was even though I dislike the
7802480	7806200	whole mission support type thing going on the one Asian chick in there that
7806200	7809920	speaks my languages that's always throwing off one-liners is hilarious but
7809920	7813240	other than that that shows garbage potential for a good video game out of
7813240	7817880	the new Knight Rider series hell no too many effects they put ground effects on
7817880	7821560	kit for crying out loud he jumped over guys and there's shit glowing on the
7821560	7824960	bottom that said kr it's like what this thing run through the hood hood or
7824960	7829800	something get some rims like I missed spinning like good lord how much crap
7829800	7834280	can you bolt on him I mean and he transformed into an f-150 of all things
7834280	7837120	my god I got so much hate for the show all right well look I know you didn't
7837120	7840040	call in just to bash on Knight Rider what what's going on here what what
7840040	7848880	actually what from what I've seen of the new Knight Rider show I thought the
7848880	7853240	little of you know TV movie that they did that kind of like pilot the thing I
7853240	7857320	thought it was pretty good I mean I don't know all right look I did have
7857320	7861760	hope until I saw episode one okay like no spirit unless the hoffs involved I'm
7861760	7864800	not watching it anywhere but anyway I don't even talk just about Knight Rider
7864800	7869080	what's on the gaming world all right Rob have you played Warhammer online yet I
7869080	7871720	have I I don't know I think you came into the show late tonight but I talked
7871720	7875960	about during my gaming week in part a hmm yeah I kind of missed that I was
7875960	7879200	busy with some stuff no that's right yeah I'm like so far man what do you
7879200	7882120	what do you do you like it now here's my thing I had some likes I had some
7882120	7885280	dislikes I liked some of the new things that Warhammer brought to the table
7885280	7889200	especially in the PvP area like I really liked some of the RVR combat that I
7889200	7892320	played I thought some of the scenarios are pretty awesome and I like the idea
7892320	7896720	of the public questing but I thought the interface was very clunky I don't know
7896720	7900360	if it's just me I found the interface to be like really clunky especially
7900360	7905760	compared to some more fluid interfaces that I've used well the interface for me
7905760	7910000	I actually was able to manage all the information well I mean maybe it's
7910000	7913840	because I'm used to looking at cluttered screens but I saw everything I needed to
7913840	7917000	see in there I don't need to pull up at this it's like if they would have buried
7917000	7920960	it into like a window that you have to pull up nobody would really want to use
7920960	7925000	it I just want to just put everything up there just make the colors bright enough
7925000	7927440	so where you can still see the stuff even though it's just like one or two
7927440	7931520	pixels wide and it worked and you can still see a lot of the game and have all
7931520	7934800	the information that you need plus a lot of this stuff for the interface that
7934800	7937760	they include on the back end like highlighting quest areas and everything
7937760	7941160	else I thought was kind of brilliant so yeah that's kind of a nice plus is that
7941160	7944160	yeah it actually kind of shows you where to go for quests which you know you
7944160	7947640	might be thinking well it's helping you cheat on the game but you know what god
7947640	7950520	people do that with Wow all the time you know they're just looking up online how
7950520	7954600	to beat the quest so you know why not build it into the game a little bit it's
7954600	7958040	not like people aren't going to tell you specifically where to go or show you on
7958040	7962600	your app you know it works in the roleplay sense yeah but orcs are finally
7962600	7966640	done right this is the way orcs are supposed to be people blizzard stole it
7966640	7971200	from from games workshop this is the way they're supposed to be oh you know the
7971200	7977920	cut yes it fungus though you must be a chaos player oh yeah I am I just I tried
7977920	7982760	the the human side was like this is boring I do this and wow let me switch
7982760	7986360	over to the other one and you know like all the all the dark elves listen the
7986360	7990720	metal they refused to dance it's like that's the way it should be it's not
7990720	7994400	evil I've been playing a high elf it's been kind of fun because I feel like I'm
7994400	7999480	going around judging everyone it's fun yeah yeah I loved it every time I click
7999480	8004040	on slash dance like so-and-so refuses to dance it's like I should be right there
8004040	8009880	are you suggesting that your night elf is judge dread no she's more of a judge
8009880	8016200	Hershey actually but you know whatever isn't that the one on divorce court no
8016200	8019800	there's a judge Hershey in judge dreads just a female one oh god okay I'm
8019800	8025440	thinking okay I'm thinking a TV show I noticed a female once but whatever so so
8025440	8029000	you're like in Warhammer online for somebody that's never played an MMO
8029000	8032520	before in their life let's say they're just turned off by the whole MMO idea is
8032520	8036520	there anything for them in Warhammer that might change your mind well this is
8036520	8040760	a good gateway drug for a while like experience definitely especially with
8040760	8045520	the public quests you get to see what a large-scale battle would be like without
8045520	8048680	having to worry about getting ganked in the back and all this other stuff by
8048680	8053120	other players so that's the good entry entry level once they include the like
8053120	8056200	like a free trial or something for people to get in they don't be kind of
8056200	8059520	good that's a really good way of explaining is you know core I think it's
8059520	8062920	the best way you kind of explain it is like you're getting to sample what end
8062920	8069400	game is like at level five that's what's kind of awesome and also when you go
8069400	8074800	around versus realm like if you actually go into like the the closed like a was
8074800	8080240	it they captured a flag and stuff like that they they took a note from City of
8080240	8083600	Heroes and sidekick you up to those appropriate levels so that way you can
8083600	8086800	actually do something at level one if you wanted to that is so I brought up
8086800	8090960	the same point I thought it was great too I thought it was great yeah but
8090960	8094520	that's all I had guys so all right I appreciate it we appreciate your phone
8094520	8098680	call and appreciate the review on Warhammer online because you know

8204720	8209440	got a you know a high-standing 3d graphics I've never heard that
8209440	8216280	description before but uh coming some time soon I don't know where ladies and
8216280	8237600	gentlemen I give you I want this fucking song in rock band yes I realize there's
8237600	8251400	no guitar drums I don't give a shit not just the show but the game itself was
8251400	8257120	actually she also had a cool cartoon series yes that that's the best theme
8257120	8265720	song to any game show ever love it we're not our phones not really ringing
8265720	8270040	tonight I guess we're very we have a very apathetic crowd and I at least one
8270040	8272840	more call I mean no offense to Xenocore but I don't want him to be the only one
8272840	8277840	that's on the show tonight apparently we are going to be harder to mod now that
8277840	8283600	they are being in case some of their drive I season are being encased epoxy
8283600	8287640	so you actually have to dissolve that ship freakin mod it or you can use one
8287640	8290400	of the contacts on the bottom of the board so it's not impossible but just
8290400	8298000	making it a little harder and if you're not into booting say backed-up games you
8298000	8303160	can still do import games with a bunch of new stuff including gecko OS version
8303160	8309720	1.07 which will now allow you to boot import games without a mod chip hello
8309720	8314660	Rama you're on orange lounge radio what's up not too much holy call cuz you
8314660	8319800	said nobody else is calling it hey that's alright we you know yeah that's

8348760	8351880	studio there's a big blank I'm sorry it's better there's a big blank space
8351880	8356400	right here and I'm thinking what we ought to do is we ought to start over
8356400	8360960	here like a giant poster board and just a big list things that piss us off about
8360960	8366680	GameStop and we'll just have a list and start adding to it as people call in and
8366680	8370600	and what have you I like that maybe I don't know what do you guys think in
8370600	8373680	chat is that good good idea about it what do you guys think here to you maybe
8373680	8380640	it should be like put them on Arnold I think my notice putting them on things

8430000	8433840	calling GameStop once and they were like I'm too busy to answer your question you

8437680	8441360	really busy but there's just better ways to say it you know what I mean like

8600360	8603480	please cuz you know that might be weird hi you're an orange launch radio who's
8603480	8609400	this hello orange lounge radio land it is Jason hello Jason land it's orange
8609400	8614800	lounge radio what's on your mind so speaking apart have you guys seen the
8614800	8620280	article that Hart published that had published in the magazine I believe it
8620280	8623560	was some time this last week about the Republican National Committee
8623560	8628960	specifically McCain using Barracuda in one of his ads yes I somehow had a bad
8628960	8633800	feeling you were gonna take this show back to politics what is it you guys
8633800	8636720	mentioned earlier you were talking about the tour I had to ask to make sure you
8636720	8640080	guys have actually seen it because it was priceless it's fine yes and for
8640080	8644680	those that aren't in the know Hart got their feathers ruffled big time because
8644680	8648920	one of the nicknames for Sarah Palin who's the vice presidential nominee
8648920	8653560	issued over the Republican Party one of her nicknames in Alaska with Sarah
8653560	8658600	Barracuda I can see Russia from my house Sarah Barracuda so they actually played
8658600	8661480	Barracuda at the Republican National Convention which is as you know a very
8661480	8665280	popular heart song where you gamers probably know it from Guitar Hero 3
8665280	8670120	because in that song in that game and heart was pissed yeah I think they're
8670120	8674160	anything but Republican yeah you know and you know a lot of musicians get
8674160	8676200	pissed off and that stuff is used because it makes it look like the
8676200	8679560	musician endorses that candidate when they often don't remember when it happens
8679560	8684360	both remember when Reagan used born in the USA and Springsteen threw a hissy
8684360	8688320	over that especially since the song was pretty much about nothing the American
8688320	8692800	the Republican Party stands for and I'm sure it works both ways like you know
8692800	8695720	there's a lot of artists like country artists and you know I think you've seen
8695720	8701960	people on the convention they that were Republican and they probably don't want
8701960	8706120	their songs being used and Obama's campaign so it's just politics what a
8706120	8710400	big mess I seem to remember when I was reading through the news that's actually
8710400	8714960	like the third time that artists have not been asked not been directly
8714960	8718960	compensated and through a hissy fit over it well specifically public inside of
8718960	8721800	the campaign whoever has been getting the music clearances over there needs to
8721800	8726520	be sacked and then whoever hired that person also needs to be sacked this is
8726520	8730040	quite possibly gonna be a very short answer I had to step out because I
8730040	8733560	really needed to get some food during the show but have we covered the epic
8733560	8738640	rock band crash and character transfer of doom tonight no what's this about
8738640	8744560	what's up I believe it was ssj 100 Matt published a put a link in chat like an
8744560	8749080	hour and a half ago pretty short shortly after the show started and apparently
8749080	8756120	for it looks to be I kind of skimmed but for local games characters created rock
8756120	8760920	band two characters would switch profiles that they were bound to like
8760920	8764560	they would be written out to the wrong gamertag so when one person goes back
8764560	8770480	and plays his characters completely gone and apparently band progress is getting
8770480	8776320	completely deleted apparently randomly perhaps when the console freezes up and
8776320	8782640	just really really poorly about 11 pages on the rock band forms to talk about all
8782640	8786800	these problems people have been having and quite unfortunately I kind of don't
8786800	8791080	want to play the game until I hear of a patch know what's funny is one thing I
8791080	8794600	did do is I signed up on the rock band forms or whatever you can link your
8794600	8802600	gamertag to the actual community it's only shown my rock band one stuff I did
8802600	8805720	that with you rock then I haven't done that since I've gotten to yet but they
8805720	8808280	don't have any of my rock band two stuff on there even though I've been playing
8808280	8811880	it online for like a while now it probably takes a while to catch up
8811880	8815240	because there's probably like tons and tons and tons of people that are all
8815240	8817760	playing this game online right now and that's probably what's causing the
8817760	8821000	crashes to is just like you know they're just probably overwhelmed me on one
8821000	8823880	hand you ought to think they know how popular their games gonna be but at the
8823880	8827960	same time you know you don't really know the strain until you put it out there
8827960	8831040	you know what I mean like you can test it test and test all you want but you
8831040	8835920	just don't know until it's out there again I'll restate that I only skimmed
8835920	8840160	it but I seem to remember that it was limited to local games and not quite
8840160	8844280	online in which case the whole comes the whole thing comes up of do people really
8844280	8848760	tested and such a narrow instance that they never had these problems when the
8848760	8851720	game was being developed it just really shocks me that the scores are just
8851720	8855560	resetting because I would think at least a backup copy saved on your local drive
8855560	8860080	if nothing else I would imagine the one thing that bugs me more than anything is
8860080	8864280	it is a you know progress and achieving further things in the game I'm already
8864280	8866960	kind of turned off just because of the fact that the initial songs are so
8866960	8870520	terrible in my opinion you know oh I might lay that about the exercise
8870520	8875040	there's a way you can unlock them all right off the bat you know right I don't
8875040	8880280	there's no button code out there I don't want to ruin it for everybody but if you
8880280	8883320	want to search the internet there's a button that you can do on the cheat menu
8883320	8885320	that will unlock all the songs automatically
8885320	8889760	well here's the thing isn't it not safe your progress when you use enables no
8889760	8892360	they disabled it this time it did well here's what it does
8892360	8896540	you can use it's the same code as in the first rock band game and what it does on
8896540	8902900	the cheat menu is it adds a toggle where you can toggle all songs off or all songs on.
8902900	8907980	And if you turn them on then you can't save, but it's more for like parties and that kind
8907980	8908980	of thing.
8908980	8911540	Right, I was just going to say, that sounds perfect for if I have a bunch of people over
8911540	8913900	really want to play and I just throw it in quick play or something.
8913900	8918260	Yeah, you can toggle it on and off once you've done it, it'll save that little toggle on
8918260	8920500	there and you can turn it on, off, or whatever.
8920500	8924060	It's under the game modifiers section under options.
8924060	8929780	So first correction, it was Sephiroth1215, it was an SSJ100 mat, and apparently, I don't
8929780	8934420	know if the forum is just overloaded or if they shit-canned this thread or something,
8934420	8938860	but I'm getting an error when I tried to browse to it again.
8938860	8943360	I posted it in chat in case anybody else was curious, but something tells me nobody else
8943360	8947380	is going to have any more luck than I am right now.
8947380	8948380	So...
8948380	8953060	You know, I was trying to load the thread too and I had the same problem, so yeah, something's
8953060	8954060	out.
8954060	8955060	Lovely.
8955060	8956060	Interesting.
8956060	8959620	So, alright, well, Jason, hey, we're going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the
8959620	8960620	show, alright?
8960620	8961620	Alrighty.
8961620	8962620	Have a good one, my friend, though.
8962620	8963620	Hi, guys.
8963620	8967340	And hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, before you go, you're a drummer, right?
8967340	8968340	You're a drummer, right?
8968340	8969340	Primarily, yeah.
8969340	8973780	You need to join the band that Shane and I have starting because we need a drummer.
8973780	8975340	What are you guys doing?
8975340	8977420	We have a band called the Emergency Kittens.
8977420	8980180	I'll contact you with more info later.
8980180	8981180	Sweet, sounds good.
8981180	8982180	Alright, later.
8982180	8983180	Thanks.
8983180	8984180	Alright.
8984180	8985180	Yes, drummer recruited.
8985180	8990380	I mean, I could have gone to Bobby Black Wolf, but he said that he's got like a million people
8990380	8991380	that he's playing with.
8991380	8993820	I'd always play a game with Bobby Black Wolf, too, if he wants to look me up.
8993820	8995900	And any drummer, really, that listens to Xbox Live.
8995900	8997220	Alright, real quick, one more call.
8997220	8998220	Real quick, one more call.
8998220	8999220	Who's this?
8999220	9000220	This is James Patrick.
9000220	9001220	Hey, James Patrick.
9001220	9002220	Quick question.
9002220	9003220	What's on your mind?
9003220	9009020	I haven't been listening to the whole show, but have you guys talked about Monster Hunter
9009020	9011660	3 Try, the information that's come out about it?
9011660	9012660	We have not.
9012660	9014380	Why don't you share that information with our audience?
9014380	9020340	Yeah, a bunch of screenshots and stuff from Famitsu has come out recently.
9020340	9023700	It's confirmed four player online.
9023700	9027260	The city will act as a lobby, apparently.
9027260	9030700	It will appear at TGS.
9030700	9035500	The engine has been completely rebuilt, apparently, for the first time since like the first Monster
9035500	9039100	Hunter game.
9039100	9043100	And yeah, it's just a bunch of screenshots out there showing the game and it looks like
9043100	9047220	Capcom is actually putting forth a lot of effort into this Wii game.
9047220	9048220	It looks pretty.
9048220	9051460	What is it that you love so much about Monster Hunter?
9051460	9055300	Haven't played it.
9055300	9056300	What is it that makes you highly anticipated?
9056300	9061980	I know people who've played it and they're very enthusiastic about it, but I think I'll
9061980	9063200	try it with this game.
9063200	9066340	What makes you so excited about this release?
9066340	9067820	Four player online.
9067820	9072380	If they use the Wii Speak, I guess that might be the thing that gets me to get Wii Speak.
9072380	9073600	Good point.
9073600	9076740	Wii Speak has the potential to be pretty cool.
9076740	9077740	We'll see.
9077740	9081380	It also has the potential to really suck, so I'm very curious to see how that kind of
9081380	9082380	plays out.
9082380	9083380	Could be very interesting.
9083380	9088380	It's got underwater battles as well, and you can go underwater and the monsters can go
9088380	9092780	up above and underwater too, apparently, and you can fight in a different environment.
9092780	9094660	That sounds like it might be interesting.
9094660	9095660	Huh.
9095660	9096660	Sounds like it could be a pretty cool game.
9096660	9100460	Well, James Patrick, thank you so much for the heads up, and we'll be counting down the
9100460	9101460	days to tell this.
9101460	9104660	Call us back and let us know how it plays out, because unfortunately, I've got so many
9104660	9106820	games I'm playing, I probably won't get around to this one.
9106820	9108300	We'll look to you for a review, okay?
9108300	9109300	All right.
9109300	9110300	All right.
9110300	9111300	Have a good one, buddy.
9111300	9112300	All right.
9112300	9114780	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9114780	9116980	If you didn't get through tonight and still want to talk to us, hey, there's always the
9116980	9121620	email bag or our chat room or our MySpace, our Facebook, our live journal, our Twitter.
9121620	9125560	There's like a million different ways to find us and interact with us, and you know we love
9125560	9126860	reaching out to you guys.
9126860	9128260	You guys help us make the show.
9128260	9129420	Any more last minute stories, Loki?
9129420	9130420	Yes.
9130420	9133680	In fact, you would have heard about this early on the Twitter, because I posted it on Twitter
9133680	9135380	before the news got out.
9135380	9140980	But Kingdom Hearts, chains of, or, Kingdom Hearts RE Chains of Memories is coming to...
9140980	9144540	To be fair, you posted it on your personal Twitter and not the OLR Twitter, and folks
9144540	9146420	may not know you have your own personal...
9146420	9147940	Yeah, whatever.
9147940	9153940	Anyways, so it's the remake that of course came out with Kingdom Hearts to Final Mix
9153940	9160460	is now coming to the US to PlayStation 2 in December on the 2nd for $29.99.
9160460	9165020	So that's not a bad deal, and of course they're adding some new stuff along with that, a brand
9165020	9170580	new voice cast, new minigames, but hey, 30 bucks, that's not bad at all, and apparently
9170580	9174580	Rockband's down, or Rockband.com's down right now.
9174580	9181220	Anyways, some other stuff, and this wasn't on show at all, but I just remembered it.
9181220	9188780	You remember last year how they did bundles with the Xbox 360 and you got free games for
9188780	9190500	no additional cost.
9190500	9198380	Well, they're doing that again this holiday, and I have what games in which consoles.
9198380	9204580	The arcade system actually is getting, I don't know if it's that great, but Sega Superstars
9204580	9213700	Tennis, and the Elite and Pro systems are both getting two games each, and those would
9213700	9218700	be Kung Fu Panda and Lego Indiana Jones.
9218700	9221100	So that's not bad for free, for the holidays.
9221100	9226420	I guess they're trying to target more of that family audience to fill that hole in their
9226420	9228020	demographic there.
9228020	9231740	Alright, and let's see here.
9231740	9237580	Lastly, I was going to mention that around the time when LittleBigPlanet comes out, they're
9237580	9242620	going to be offering some free download content, one of which is a spacesuit, so yes, you can
9242620	9243940	be a spaceman as well.
9243940	9245700	Is that only for pre-orders or something?
9245700	9250740	No, it's just, they're going to offer it for a limited time during the first week when
9250740	9255660	it comes out, and also you can get a rare t-shirt in it that says, I was there for week
9255660	9256660	one.
9256660	9261460	They're both going to be free to download, and the very last thing, this kind of goes
9261460	9266980	back to if you're listening live and heard our little funk remixes on there, you too
9266980	9269620	can check those out for free.
9269620	9280500	They're all free to download off of the guy's website, which is LIDBJORK.HOMELINX.ORG slash
9280500	9285620	Nintendo, and the website's called Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo.
9285620	9297300	You can also catch them on MySpace dot com slash H-E-N-R-I-K-L-I-D-B-J-O-R-K, and all
9297300	9298300	those are free to download.
9298300	9299300	B-J-O-R-K?
9299300	9300300	Bjork?
9300300	9301300	Bjork, yes.
9301300	9302300	Yeah, LIDBJORK.
9302300	9303300	Nice.
9303300	9305940	And those are all free to download.
9305940	9311940	He has Nintenseploitation, and then there's another album, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo,
9311940	9317460	which when I was playing one of those AUG files, it crashed my computer, so I stopped
9317460	9318460	playing those.
9318460	9322100	But the first album that he has, Sex, Drugs, and Nintendo, is a lot of Mega Man stuff,
9322100	9328060	and some of the other games he remixes, Disney's DuckTales, there's a few tracks on there from
9328060	9334140	that, and Gunsmoke, and of course, oh there's one from Maniac Mansion, that's kind of cool.
9334140	9335780	Alright, very cool.
9335780	9339580	Some of them are good, some of them are alright.
9339580	9347740	There was one from Mario Brothers, or something that's kind of weird, or Link's Got a Bop
9347740	9350340	Gun, that was kind of a weird one.
9350340	9352420	Alright, that's it.
9352420	9353420	Awesome, awesome.
9353420	9356920	Well, DarkSakura, I'd ask if you have any last minute stories, but I know your voice
9356920	9358740	is not doing too hot.
9358740	9359740	No.
9359740	9362300	So, well, I hope you feel better.
9362300	9367860	In the meantime, I hope the allergies die down, and stop scratching at your throat,
9367860	9370820	because that's very rude when you're a radio person, to do that.
9370820	9374340	It feels like an undead bird crawled into my throat and made a nest.
9374340	9375340	You, you.
9375340	9376340	Fuck, fuck, fuck.
9376340	9380140	Alright, well I will ask for one more thing from you tonight, and that is, your final
9380140	9381140	thought.
9381140	9383380	Oh, that one's really easy.
9383380	9386380	You know what it is?
9386380	9391380	Dying of fire, immediately.
9391380	9393940	Loki, your final thought.
9393940	9399780	My final thought is the Baskin-Robbins, I guess their Heath Shake, has 2300 calories
9399780	9400780	in it.
9400780	9404060	Thank God I don't like Heath bars.
9404060	9408260	My final thought is Frozen Yogurt sounds really awesome right now.
9408260	9409260	That's what I want.
9409260	9411260	I really want Frozen Yogurt right now.
9411260	9414660	Hey, thank you guys so much for, unfortunately the Frozen Yogurt place closes at 9, and it's
9414660	9415660	now 9.05.
9415660	9420780	Thank you guys for staying up and listening to us tonight, and supporting Independent
9420780	9421780	Radio.
9421780	9424900	If you like what you heard, tell two friends about our show.
9424900	9425900	That's how we spread the word.
9425900	9428300	It's all via word of mouth, you guys.
9428300	9429300	Really appreciate it.
9429300	9431500	Or you could leave us a five-star review on iTunes.
9431500	9433140	We've had a few people do that this week.
9433140	9436880	Thank you guys so much to the new five-star reviews we've had left on iTunes.
9436880	9437880	Really appreciate it.
9437880	9440580	Cheeseburger messaged me with dongle.
9440580	9443860	Yeah, I saw dongle show up on Twitter.
9443860	9444860	Dongle.
9444860	9451060	Let's see, we had Mozart FX left a nice five-star review, and Skylark91 left a nice one, Warrior
9451060	9452060	Bob a few days ago.
9452060	9453060	They did the crappy review.
9453060	9454060	We call you out.
9454060	9457140	Dan Shadow, who emailed us, left a nice five-star review not that long ago, so thank you guys
9457140	9459780	so much who have left the nice reviews for us on iTunes.
9459780	9461140	Every little bit helps.
9461140	9462140	We really appreciate it.
9462140	9463140	Spread the word.
9463140	9464940	Have we got any one-star reviews on there?
9464940	9468700	If we did, I would not acknowledge them on this program, because we don't want to encourage
9468700	9472620	more people to do it, because actually one-star reviews really hurt.
9472620	9476220	Look, if you want to give the show a one-star review, don't do that.
9476220	9479420	Go give a show you like more a five-star review.
9479420	9480540	It's much more impactful.
9480540	9484260	Go help a show you do like then, because it's just kind of rude to leave a one-star review
9484260	9485260	in my opinion.
9485260	9486260	All right.
9486260	9487260	That's it.
9487260	9488260	We're out of here.
9488260	9489260	Have a good night, everybody.
9489260	9493460	We'll see you next week with episode 296 of Orange Lounge Radio as we inch closer to that
9493460	9494460	big 300 mark.
