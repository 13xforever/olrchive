00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Today, September 14th, 2008, could a Wii storage problem solution finally be coming?

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,960
The Mortal Kombat vs. DC roster leaks thanks to its achievements, and the first details

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,000
emerge on DJ Hero.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,400
Hello, everybody out there on the internets, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Radio.

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,800
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
lifestyle.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,800
It's where every gamer has a voice, including you guys when you join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,760
But the voices you'll probably hear most are myself, Rob Roberts, and with me as always,

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,720
the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Hi.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,360
How you doing, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
I'm here.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Almost like your new name.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
Not really, though.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,720
Um, just don't call me Bob.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Okay, Bob.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,360
All right, also joining us tonight.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,280
You know what, Rob?

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,000
Returning after being on vacation last week, I don't know who told him he could take a

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,720
week off, but apparently he took it upon himself to take a week off after being so exhausted

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,920
from Penny Arcade Expo, it's Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Hey.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
So what was it?

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
The day job kept you away, right?

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Yeah.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
I had to go to San Francisco.

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, you poor thing.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
You had to get bought fancy dinners by the company, I'm sure, huh?

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Yes.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,240
You poor, poor thing.

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,520
Any game-related things you saw?

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,480
Oh, you probably can't talk about them, even if you did, huh?

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
I, no.

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,080
I didn't, I, no, everything there is just, like, like company-related stuff.

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,760
They, I mean, they mentioned a few, like, release seats for movies that, you know, I

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
don't know.

39
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
But nothing.

40
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
But nothing.

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
There's no game stuff.

42
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,360
They, they just, like, oh yeah, I'm gonna do a game soon.

43
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,080
It's more of an afterthought.

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
It's all movie stuff.

45
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
A little bit.

46
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,000
I gave everyone a $1,500 trip to one of ten locations.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, poor thing.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,520
Well, that's just $1,500.

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,880
You have to book your own trip, so that may cover your flight, and that's about it.

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,080
We could go to, what, Fresno?

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
On that?

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
No, it's one of ten locations.

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,240
So it's either Hawaii, Hollywood, Seattle, somewhere in Arizona, I forget what it was.

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,160
Can you save it for next year and go to Seattle next year?

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,200
By the end of 2009.

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,280
And no, I'm not going to PAX next year for that.

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,320
I'm not using it for PAX, no.

58
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:37,640
There's San Antonio, Chicago, Boston, New York City, and Orlando.

59
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,960
So lots, lots of neat places.

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Oh, and Hawaii.

61
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,560
You said Hawaii.

62
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,600
Stop rubbing it in.

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,000
And then I found out the other day, because this was originally only being offered to

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,280
our movie sales, we're going to be probably getting a 42-inch Sony Bravia Plasma TV through

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
some deal.

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,480
Basically, our video reps are selling some Sony product, and the goals seem reasonable,

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,080
so probably by Christmas, I'll have another TV.

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,600
Let me know when they're hiring, okay?

69
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Good luck.

70
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,120
Our company, trust me, it sounds good, and if you're movie sales, you're probably making

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,080
out pretty good, but everyone else is not.

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,240
An orange job radio here on all games radio tonight.

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,800
All right, let's get, let's shift.

74
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
But, oh, wait, wait, wait.

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,440
I was going to say, just taking it back to the gaming, though, I did go to Japan town,

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,320
and I picked up a pillow shaped like a question block from Mario Brothers, so they're hanging

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,520
in my desk just like a question block would be.

78
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,720
They wouldn't let me hang it from the ceiling, so I had to put it under my shelf.

79
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,360
I was going to say, when you get frustrated, would you just go, boing, and get it?

80
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,480
Well, if I hate it, it knocks it off, but that's fine.

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,640
And then I also bought, because I used to do and collect Gundam figures, they had armored

82
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,680
core figures, so I picked up one of those, I'm going to build that, so that's kind of

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
cool.

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
But lots of game stuff there.

85
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,200
Now, I remember seeing at Dark Soccer's house something very similar to the question mark

86
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
block.

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,680
She has a goomba, and you can actually hit it, and it makes a little squishy sound when

88
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
you hit it.

89
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,640
Yes, they had a bunch of Yoshi's there, and a bunch of Yoshi eggs, but I didn't want any

90
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,400
of those, because Yoshi's like Jar Jar.

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
All right.

92
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,920
Yoshi is not Jar Jar.

93
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,880
He's the Jar Jar of the Mario World.

94
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
He is not.

95
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
Yoshi's awesome.

96
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Jar Jar was Jar Jar.

97
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,200
You did not even in the same league.

98
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
How dare you?

99
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
All right.

100
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,640
Let's get into some actual video gaming, besides the whole Yoshi debate, and talk a little

101
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,680
bit about your gaming week, Dark Sakura.

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,880
How was your gaming week?

103
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,280
It wasn't, because I haven't had a chance to really play much other than Ragnarok.

104
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,480
But I did open my copy of The World Ends With You, and I'm going to be starting it, so that's

105
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,360
some progress, right?

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Yes.

107
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,920
Sometimes opening the box can be a day-long chore in itself, for real, the way they wrap

108
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
them.

109
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
No, no, no, no, no.

110
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I played Salamander.

111
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Oh, how was that?

112
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,640
Because I picked up the Salamander pack for Dan on PSP, and it was pretty cool.

113
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Very cool.

114
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
And, and, and, and, and.

115
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
And?

116
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,040
I downloaded a ROM for puzzle and dusted, so I can play it again.

117
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,920
Ah, our classic game of the week last week.

118
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Yep.

119
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,200
Now, Salamander, um, was Life Force here in the US, kind of.

120
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Yes.

121
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Kind of.

122
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Right?

123
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Because it was a lot more difficult, if I remember right.

124
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
I think I've played the Salamander arcade game.

125
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
They were both pretty freaking hard.

126
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,120
But Life Force was kind of easy, from what I remember.

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,400
Life Force was still kind of difficult.

128
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,680
I mean, I wouldn't say it was our type hard, but it was pretty tough.

129
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,960
Didn't it have a 30 lives code or something, or at least it had the up, up, down, down,

130
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
like you could get all the power-ups?

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Yeah.

132
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Okay.

133
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
I think that made it easier.

134
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,440
GS68 wants to know, was it one or two Salamander?

135
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,200
I got the deluxe pack.

136
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
The first one.

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Ah.

138
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
There you go.

139
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
The both games pack.

140
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Cool.

141
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Alright.

142
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Loki, how was your gaming week?

143
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,320
Pretty good, because I have a lot of weeks to catch up on, but I didn't play that much.

144
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,840
I played, let's see, Mercenaries 2.

145
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,120
I got that slightly before it came out, and I've been playing it a little bit.

146
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:10,200
I can say, I haven't played the first Mercenaries game, but damn, number 2 is seriously broken.

147
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,400
But it's broken in an amusing way.

148
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,920
Like, for example, some of the physics in it are kind of wonky, like you can tap a tree

149
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,000
with a motorcycle and it explodes, and pretty much there's nothing you can do as far as

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,120
sitting in a car that's about to explode to hurt yourself.

151
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,920
I mean, if your car explodes while you happen to be in it, you'll take a little bit of damage,

152
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,060
and that's about it.

153
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,800
I was walking around an enemy camp and I hit a barbell and it kicked it like a soccer ball,

154
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,120
which is kind of funny, and then there was one part where I was playing it and I got

155
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,680
injured to the point where I was about to die, and when you die, your screen starts

156
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,680
to kind of blink red and you hear your heart beat and stuff.

157
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,840
Well, it stayed like that, and so I was invulnerable, and any vehicle I got in, I was invincible

158
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,280
in as well, until I turned the game off.

159
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
So that was fun.

160
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,200
And then they have a nice glitch with one of the little side missions you can do the

161
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,840
bet money on to actually make money off of, where they have a maximum where you can only

162
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:20,840
make $5 million per bet, but the problem is, though, is the minimum is calculated off of

163
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,880
the amount of money that you have, and the minimum doesn't have a cap to it, so you can

164
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,200
keep playing this game until you have a $50 million minimum and a maximum of $5 million,

165
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
so that's kind of broken, too.

166
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,840
It's just, the whole game's kind of broken, but I guess it's kind of fun.

167
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,240
Then of course, I played More Grand Theft Auto IV, I'm on a two-week winning streak

168
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:51,200
now with our company group, so that was fun, and I played Spore, and it's kind of boring.

169
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,120
I'm not too far into it, I'm to the tribe stage right now, but I haven't really actually

170
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,800
played the tribe stage yet, but the cell and creature stages are quite boring, and I hope

171
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,520
the rest of the game's not like that, but so far I'm very unimpressed by the graphics,

172
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm very unimpressed by the gameplay.

173
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,080
It just looks like a game that should have been out like years ago, I don't know.

174
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,140
And then Rock Band 2, I was lucky enough to get that a little early, so I've been playing

175
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,480
quite a bit of Rock Band 2 actually.

176
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,920
We have a fellow worker at my company that plays quite a bit of Rock Band, and so he's

177
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,960
been playing it along with me, and we started a band in there, and one of the random names

178
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,360
they gave us was Unfit Barf Bags, so we stuck with it, and I made a cool logo and stuff,

179
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,720
and so we've been playing that.

180
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,920
I actually bought the Mad Catz Precision Bass that they have for it, and that controller's

181
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
fucking awesome.

182
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,440
It has like a little double strum.

183
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,320
Whoa, wait, did you just say Mad Catz and Awesome in the same sentence?

184
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I know.

185
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
I know.

186
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Wow.

187
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Well, their Rock Band stuff's actually pretty good.

188
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
It really...

189
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Pinch me.

190
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Seriously.

191
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
I must be dreaming.

192
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
I know.

193
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,920
I mean, eventually this is bound to happen, but no, it actually is a pretty good controller.

194
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,880
What's next, a DDR mat that won't break after a week?

195
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
I don't know about that.

196
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Surely you jest.

197
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,840
But the Rock Band stuff though, they're doing some good stuff with that.

198
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,700
I have to preface this real fast, I'm sorry.

199
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,800
If you don't know why people always kind of joke about Mad Catz and you know how all their

200
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
stuff is broken, like, I don't know, for me, it dates back to the days that we used to

201
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
cover DDR, right?

202
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,040
Like, I don't know, Dark Soccer, did you ever own a Mad Catz pad?

203
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
No.

204
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
With $20 pads?

205
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Have you heard about them, Shirley?

206
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,160
I did, but I remember what I used to say, I would never buy anything knockoff.

207
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,440
Yeah, exactly.

208
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,440
And they were like the $20 dance pads, so everybody was like, yay, cheap dance pad.

209
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,280
Well, they would break after like a week.

210
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
They were definitely made with $20 parts.

211
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,320
At least with the Rock Band stuff, and I know that these are officially licensed products,

212
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,960
and I mean, Mad Catz is in charge of making the cymbals that are gonna be optional for

213
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,120
Rock Band 2.

214
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,460
They're the only people that are making them, and this bass is something that they're starting

215
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,800
to put out too, and it's actually put together a lot better than the controller is, the normal

216
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,480
guitar controller that you can buy.

217
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,240
So what makes it kind of unique, though, they have a thumb rest on it and a dual strummer.

218
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,720
It's split down the middle, so you can kind of strum it like you would a bass guitar.

219
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,460
The only thing I don't like about it, and I know you can't really whammy on a bass guitar,

220
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,680
but the whammy bar is no longer a bar, it's a knob, and it's literally impossible unless

221
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,720
you had a third arm to trigger it.

222
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,680
I need to interject here, because I want to do a quick poll in our chat room, because

223
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm really, really curious about this before you finish this story.

224
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,200
All right, and this is for the longtime music game fans only, of which I know we have many

225
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,040
that listen to Orange Lawns Radio, because we've been doing this a while when we all

226
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,640
started with DDR.

227
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,320
Here's my quick poll question for chat, will you find it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz

228
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,840
if this bass guitar thing is as awesome as Loki says it is?

229
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
That's my quick poll.

230
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,760
Do you have it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz?

231
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,120
I also do have a comment that I don't see what the difference should be in the strum

232
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,880
bar or not, because I always play the Guitar Hero ones strumming upwards and not downwards,

233
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,960
because you play bass strumming upwards.

234
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,280
But it's so that you can hit it faster if you want to.

235
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,900
Yeah, I like that it's split in two.

236
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,240
That is kind of cool, because you can use like two fingers.

237
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
You walk it with your fingers on them.

238
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
That would take some getting used to.

239
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,440
It does take some getting used to, and it, I don't know.

240
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I like it though.

241
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
It's really good.

242
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,880
I'll read the reviews on it if you have any qualms about buying it.

243
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,880
All the reviews have been extremely positive about it, so maybe it is a turn for the better.

244
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,520
And then, let's see what else did I play.

245
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,040
Wait, here's the results of our quick poll, all right.

246
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,080
Can you find it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz?

247
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Polled it.

248
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,480
Chat.orangeawnsradio.com, here we go.

249
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Fuck no.

250
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
No.

251
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Never.

252
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Nope.

253
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Probably.

254
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
No.

255
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Hell no.

256
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Never.

257
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
I'm waiting for Hori to make a guitar con from GS68.

258
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Maybe.

259
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,680
Perhaps, if the price is right, and that's because it has a better D-pad.

260
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,920
I had a Mad Catz GameCube controller, and it was crap.

261
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
There you go.

262
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,640
The results of the quick poll.

263
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Okay.

264
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Resoundingly negative.

265
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,040
I'd buy a Hori one.

266
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:10,840
They're also supposed to be making, later on, full wood controllers for Rock Band.

267
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,700
They're going to be actual, like, guitars.

268
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,440
So I don't know.

269
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
It's nice.

270
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
Who wants to come over to my house to play Rock Band?

271
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I got wood.

272
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,800
I was going to say, does that mean you have wood?

273
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,280
The other thing I tried out were the PDP drum silencers.

274
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:34,440
Now, I had tried some third-party, like the Rock Band, or it's like rockbanddrumsilencer.com

275
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
or something like that.

276
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
They're really cheap-ass, you know, foam shit.

277
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,360
Well, these are the official ones that they actually sell in the stores for 20 bucks,

278
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,040
and they work pretty good.

279
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,200
I don't know.

280
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,760
Did you play drums a little bit, Rob?

281
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,880
Yeah, I played drums at your little thing when I came over.

282
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,760
Did they work pretty good, the sensitivity on them?

283
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,120
It could have been a little better, honestly.

284
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,440
Some of the pads were better than others.

285
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,720
Like, I noticed the red one.

286
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
I had a lot of problems.

287
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,000
That could, admittedly, it could be the way I drum.

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,360
I'm not used to drumming.

289
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
I don't claim to drum professionally.

290
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,880
It could also be my drum set, because it's a first-generation one.

291
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,280
Apparently, all the other ones, they've made more sensitive, so I don't know.

292
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,640
But I thought it worked pretty well.

293
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
I don't know.

294
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,080
It beats being extremely loud with those, because it bugs everything.

295
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
True.

296
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,400
The volume is much more manageable with the little silencers on it.

297
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
I don't know.

298
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,160
I was trying to find the Rock Band 2 drum sets, which were supposedly out today, and

299
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,660
apparently nobody knows that they're supposed to be out today.

300
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,320
So EA just didn't ship anybody, because I went to Gamestop, which, I might add, Gamestop

301
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,080
told me they were coming out today, and they said, oh yeah, we have some coming in for

302
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,400
our pre-order customers, but we don't know how many extras they're gonna have.

303
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,460
And then I come back to a different Gamestop, and they're all, what are you talking about?

304
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,000
They're coming out in October.

305
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,960
And I'm a liar!

306
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,320
No, he was an idiot, is what he was.

307
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,440
And I went to the Fry's, and they didn't know about it, and Best Buy said they're getting

308
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,240
them later in the week, so I'm just assuming they didn't ship anybody, which, not surprising.

309
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,620
But yeah, I need to get some of those new drums, because I want to plug in useless shit

310
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,400
to them.

311
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,320
And because my drum set will probably go to my sister eventually, so.

312
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
That's it.

313
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,840
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

314
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,200
Alright, my gaming week, kind of a lot of the same things that Matt's been talking about,

315
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
so I don't want to repeat too bad.

316
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,560
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, one more thing, sorry, sorry, sorry.

317
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,760
Castle Crashers, fucking awesome.

318
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
That's it.

319
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Alright.

320
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,440
I've been playing mostly Spore and Rock Band 2 as well.

321
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,320
Although most of my Rock Band 2 was early, early this morning, because I went to a Walmart,

322
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,880
which I usually don't shop at Walmart, but it was the only place that was doing it at

323
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,040
midnight, so I was like, alright, I'll go.

324
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,400
So I went into Walmart and, you know, just bought it.

325
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,880
I had to wait around, because they didn't realize the game was coming out, but whatever,

326
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,520
you know, I guess they're not used to games coming out on Sunday or something, although

327
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,520
as Bobby pointed out- They're not used to working at Walmart at

328
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
midnight.

329
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,440
Well, no, actually, you know, I was going to try to defend them a little bit, you know,

330
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,860
Be Devil's Advocate, but you might be right, because I was actually told they can't find

331
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,440
the box right now because the guy's on break.

332
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,120
So we had to sit around and wait for the guy to get back from break.

333
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,800
So I finally got out of there about 1230 with Rock Band 2, but whatever, I got Rock Band,

334
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,800
so the hell with it.

335
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,880
So I've actually been enjoying Rock Band 1.5, as I've kind of been calling it, because a

336
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,360
lot of it feels pretty much like Rock Band 1 with a newer, better song list.

337
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,560
All the problems that you wish had been fixed in 1 are now fixed.

338
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,800
For instance, you know, you can do a band tour mode by yourself.

339
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,000
In fact, there is no more single player tour.

340
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,640
It's just all the band world tour, and you know, it's kind of fun to make a sticker and

341
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
stuff.

342
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
And the online is much more comprehensive.

343
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,520
You can do these battle of the bands where you're automatically, you know, playing against

344
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:53,000
your friends list in a Geometry Wars 2 stylish way of taking over their scores, and you know,

345
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,360
on these set lists that could be up for a week or a few hours.

346
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,360
It's pretty crazy.

347
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,920
So yeah, that's more rounded out online mode, but as far as like graphics and some of that,

348
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,520
like the interface hasn't really changed at all.

349
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,600
The models and everything are the exact same ones they had in Rock Band 1.

350
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,960
The motion capturing was a lot better though, I think.

351
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Was it?

352
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,800
It didn't even seem that different to me, to be honest.

353
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,740
So it's a little bit Rock Band 1.5-ish to me, but then again, this is kind of where

354
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,720
we're going with music games is it's a Madden all its own now, you know, to, you know, and

355
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,560
you know, I say Rock Band 1.5 in somewhat, you know, in jest because, you know, obviously

356
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,380
we've been playing DDR for years.

357
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,480
We're used to this crap where it's pretty much the same game with new songs.

358
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,360
But seriously though, if the best feature I think in this game is actually something

359
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,780
that's part of Rock Band 1, which is a song export feature, that I think makes it stand

360
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:58,780
out from Guitar Hero easy because now, if it were like DDR, you can take all your songs

361
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,400
from the previous mixes and add them in to your next, you know, Rock Band 2, you know,

362
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,720
you take all those songs from Rock Band 1, Rock Band 3 is going to have 2 and 1, so you're

363
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,760
just going to get this ever-expanding song list and I think that's pretty cool.

364
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,360
Yeah, no, I definitely agree.

365
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
I think that's cool.

366
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,100
I think that's one of the greatest things is just firing up a make-your-own set list

367
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,720
type thing and you have like literally 150 songs to choose from because you have download

368
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,680
songs, Rock Band 1 songs, Rock Band 2 songs, it's insane, but awesome.

369
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,680
And then like, you know, playing a random set list or playing online when you have to

370
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,600
play random songs, you get songs you forgot you had or songs you didn't know you even

371
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,560
had to play, so that's kind of cool.

372
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,720
Other games I've been playing this week, Spore, Spore, Spore, I bought Spore and I've been

373
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,240
playing that, like Loki, I can't seem to get past the tribal phase, but it's because A,

374
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,380
I have a quick attention span and B, I just kind of suck at it and the game doesn't give

375
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,080
you a whole lot of help, so you kind of have to learn about the game yourself.

376
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,760
And I find that when I get too frustrated, I want to go back and start from the beginning

377
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,560
and try a bunch of things different I didn't do right the first time.

378
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,520
That's kind of what I've been doing is like, you know, the first time I was trying to do

379
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,040
an herbivore, make nice with everybody, but then I was like, you know what, fuck this,

380
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,520
I want to be a carnivore and just eat everybody.

381
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,120
So that's how I decided to play the second time around.

382
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,720
The other thing I learned about Spore is that I really suck at making animals.

383
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,040
I mean, don't get me wrong, the interface is really awesome.

384
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,680
I love the creature creator.

385
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,000
It really does make you feel like, you know, even if you don't know much about art or whatever,

386
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,260
you can do some neat things just by basically clicking and moving the mouse in random directions.

387
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,600
You can get these Picasso style animals that aren't that bad, but I still feel like I'm

388
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,000
crap crappy at animal design, but that's just something I guess is learned with time because

389
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,940
I kind of like, Loki, you had a creature that has like one ginormous eye, like a scorpion

390
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,280
that showed up in my planet that was actually kind of cool looking.

391
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,600
Oh yeah, it was supposed to be like a dog looking thing and the eye was its nose because

392
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
it was black.

393
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,080
It kind of looked, I called it spike and it had like a, my, my current creature, that's

394
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,120
like a, a carnivore that just eats everything.

395
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,840
It looks like a velociraptor, but with a giant, um, mouth, but it's like one of those, like,

396
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,120
hello, my name is George.

397
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,760
Like type of mouths, like, like, like, uh, you know, old, you know, pudgy guy mouth.

398
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm sorry, but like all the creatures in that game looks stupid.

399
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,440
It's like even, even the ones I create, I'm like, wow, that looks dumb.

400
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,840
Look at the stuff on Sporepedia though.

401
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,640
There's some pretty impressive stuff in there.

402
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,640
I mean, especially like what I do, I don't play with the internet random drops of animals

403
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,560
because I'm sure there's a lot of crap in there.

404
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,240
I only play with the Maxis ones, which you can't turn off and then my friends list.

405
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,880
So either I see crappy things my friends made or I can see the cool looking Maxis ones.

406
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,480
I should probably do that because there's been some really stupid things that came in.

407
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,840
How many penis monsters have you seen in Spore?

408
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Zero.

409
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Really?

410
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Zero penis monsters.

411
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
I haven't made one though myself.

412
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
That's pretty impressive.

413
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
I'm surprised.

414
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,760
I get, well, can't you like report it or something if it happens?

415
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
I don't know.

416
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
See, that's the thing.

417
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,200
I don't have to report it because I just want to, I was going to make a planet of penis

418
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,080
monsters or something because that'd be funny.

419
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,080
The one other thing I've been playing, I've been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the

420
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Lich King.

421
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
I got into beta.

422
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,880
I didn't really read the user and agreement, so I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say

423
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
about it.

424
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,360
Although I'm pretty sure most wild side has been talking pretty openly about it.

425
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,760
I'm going to talk about everything about it.

426
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,220
I honestly, what is there to talk about?

427
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,720
It's been extremely laggy and very hard to kill things.

428
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,040
I was like, Ooh, pretty new splash screens.

429
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Ooh, pretty new graphics.

430
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,960
I'm on a pretty new continent.

431
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,120
But that's about as much as I could see because it was very, very laggy, but it's a beta.

432
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,280
It's free for me to play.

433
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,680
I can't complain nor base a review off it.

434
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
So what can you do?

435
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
I can complain.

436
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,060
Oh, I'd rather not complain because I realize it's a beta and it's free and it's not the

437
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,800
finished product.

438
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,160
But all I can say is that it's hard for me to get a feel for it.

439
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
I will say this though.

440
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,800
The new achievement system is kind of interesting.

441
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,480
I noticed that now you have to have a Blizzard account and I think that's how it's going

442
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,720
to tie to Diablo and Starcraft 2 and the other Blizzard franchises.

443
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,920
And the game does pretty much know with some hit and miss accuracy what achievements you've

444
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,160
already unlocked.

445
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,800
I think it goes through your quest log and figures out what quests you've already done

446
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,120
and therefore what achievements you must have beat.

447
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:22,200
But when I first fired up my character on the beta and unlocked all the achievements

448
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,240
you get from historical information, the game does not think I've ever run Slave Pens Heroic.

449
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,840
And if you're a Warcraft player, you know that everybody has run Slave Pens Heroic a

450
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,800
lot once you're at level 70.

451
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,360
It's like free badges.

452
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,260
So it still has some tweaking to do, but it's not bad.

453
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,260
So anyway, that's it.

454
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,520
I don't want to drag out gaming week too long.

455
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,940
We're already like 20 minutes into the show.

456
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,560
We got gaming news to get to.

457
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,880
I'll really quickly save for housekeeping tonight.

458
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,240
There's not an awful lot to say.

459
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Just a reminder.

460
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,280
I'll be at E for All in a couple weeks.

461
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,400
Sadly, Dark Soccer and Loki will not be joining me.

462
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,160
But I'll be there hoping to meet some of you in the LA area that are going to come out

463
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
for E for All.

464
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Look at All Games booth.

465
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,860
It's supposed to be right out there on the main floor.

466
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,360
It's going to be pretty awesome.

467
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
I'm sure they'll say more about that on allgames.com.

468
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,360
And that is the first weekend in October, the third through the fifth, if I'm not mistaken.

469
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,760
I will be there in LA.

470
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,220
Also, if you haven't already, check us out on Twitter at username OLR on Twitter.

471
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,220
That's a new one.

472
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,960
There's always our live journal at Orange Lounge, our Myspace at Orange Lounge Radio.

473
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
And Facebook.

474
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Our name is the OLR me.

475
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
That's right.

476
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,160
Four different sites, four different names, just to confuse you further.

477
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
All right.

478
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,720
Let's get into the gaming news for tonight.

479
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
We'll start off with Loki.

480
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,560
What's going on in gaming news?

481
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,880
Well, Nintendo has released a new peripheral for the Wii system.

482
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,400
No, it's not a hard drive.

483
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,860
It's a wireless router because I guess they phased out the little USB sticks that they

484
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,640
had to use with your PC.

485
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,880
And now this is its own standalone thing and will allow you to connect to, it's basically

486
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:04,520
I guess like an ethernet bridge, and will allow you to connect your Wii to your router,

487
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,960
to your wired network.

488
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
I don't know.

489
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Do we really need this?

490
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,160
Is this a replacement for the dongle they had, the USB stick that you had?

491
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,560
Rob, you just said one of my favorite funny words.

492
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Dongle?

493
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
Dongle.

494
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,720
I'm going to make a spore creature and call it dongle.

495
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Dongle?

496
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Let me put it this way.

497
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Okay.

498
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
I'll make one called balls.

499
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
All right.

500
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
You do that.

501
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,920
It's an okay idea I guess to have a wireless router or a wireless bridge for whatever reason

502
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,280
because say you want to connect your Wii to your wireless network.

503
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,460
Well, the problem is for 53 bucks, it costs actually 5800 yen or $53 US, which is about

504
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,800
the equivalent there.

505
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:49,720
For 57 bucks, you could probably get yourself a wireless router and then all of your systems

506
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
can use it.

507
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,480
Oh, and it also works with DS as well.

508
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
I don't know.

509
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,680
Well, my thought is what exactly are you going to take your Wii online for that badly if

510
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,160
you need one of these?

511
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
To buy more virtual console games I guess?

512
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Yeah.

513
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,440
I mean are there that many games that support, I guess Brawl and all that, but not a lot.

514
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,080
This is just so your Wii can connect to the internet.

515
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,120
This is basically a wireless router, but it's Nintendo branded and it looks like the Wii

516
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,480
sort of.

517
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
I don't know.

518
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,600
I think it's a waste of time, but there's cheaper solutions out there.

519
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,480
Say for example this is sitting next to your wired router, your Wii is, I mean they have

520
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,560
$20 USB wired dongles that you can get to connect straight to it.

521
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Yeah, dongle.

522
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,040
I mean it beats paying $53.

523
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
I don't know.

524
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,800
I don't really think this is a problem for a lot of people to connect wirelessly to their

525
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
network or something.

526
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,000
Just buy a new router.

527
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,840
AlphaKananagram in chat says this does allow PCs.

528
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,760
It's a router for PCs as well.

529
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,800
Well that's awesome, but once again I would rather that you bought just a normal router.

530
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Buy a Linksys or something.

531
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
But is it pretty?

532
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That's the important question.

533
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,760
Linksys are not that pretty white with the blue lights.

534
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,440
It's white and they have a little stand that makes it stand up just like the Wii, but it,

535
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,460
I mean, I don't know.

536
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,240
I guess this is gonna appeal to the same people that like, you know, Macs, you know, pretty

537
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,960
but useless.

538
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,840
Hey Jamie, dongle.

539
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,760
Who knows?

540
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,600
This may never come out over here.

541
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,720
Oh, by the way though, if you are interested in this and you want to get it and you live

542
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,400
in Japan, it will be coming out on the 18th.

543
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:49,160
Alright, moving on to more hardware possibly, but not a hard drive according to Reggie Fils-Aime

544
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,360
who spoke to the Nintendo magazine Club Nintendo.

545
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,440
That's the Latin American magazine translated.

546
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,000
Reggie actually said, quote, we are working on a storage solution.

547
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,960
We have never said that it will be a hard drive, nor have we mentioned how we will fix

548
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
this issue.

549
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,160
We are going to deliver a better way to store the games.

550
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,080
You might remember I got really pissed off when this guy over at Nintendo Europe referred

551
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,520
to everybody that wanted this storage solution as Geeks and Otaku.

552
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,940
It was what they wanted and I thought that was a completely idiotic thing to have one

553
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,440
of your representatives saying that and I said, you know what, screw Nintendo, I'm not

554
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,760
going to buy anything online until they fix this problem and yes, I know I could copy

555
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,480
things to the SD card and copy them back, but I don't want to.

556
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,520
I shouldn't have to go through that because A, it's slow and B, why can't it just read

557
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
off the SD card?

558
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,840
It could use some type of cache or something.

559
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
I don't know.

560
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
It can't be that difficult.

561
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
This worries me.

562
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
I'm sorry.

563
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Why?

564
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,840
This statement worries me because they're trying to think up a solution that's a creative

565
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,180
solution to this.

566
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,040
Why go the elaborate route when you can just go the easy route and make it so that it will

567
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,640
work with USB hard drives or USB flash drives or something like that?

568
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,720
They're going to try to do something stupid like network storage where they'll just basically

569
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,680
store the game on their server and you'll have a key and you'll have to download it

570
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,640
every time you want to play it or something like that.

571
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,200
They're going to do something retarded like this.

572
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I know it.

573
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,760
Well, here's my thought is that Wii 2, just like they've done a DS and a DS Lite, they'll

574
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
release a Wii 2.

575
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,400
They should give us a dongle.

576
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
The increased storage and possibly a dongle attachment.

577
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:28,440
It needs to have a dongle attachment that leads to Bluetooth to a separate hard drive.

578
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Don't get me wrong.

579
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,760
I mean, they had some innovative ideas when they first put out the Wii, but all ideas

580
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,840
since that haven't been that innovative and actually have been kind of a step backwards.

581
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
Let's see.

582
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,480
We had, well, what are we going to do for shooter games?

583
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
I know.

584
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,840
Let's release a plastic shell.

585
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,100
What are we going to do for driving games?

586
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
I know.

587
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,100
Let's release a plastic shell.

588
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,000
What are we going to do for storage?

589
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I know.

590
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Let's do something stupid.

591
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I mean, that's what's going to happen.

592
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,200
I can just see Reggie at next E3 coming out to introduce Wii Plus or Wii 2.

593
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Look at this.

594
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
It's holographic storage.

595
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,720
With his increased storage space and his massive dongle.

596
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Look at this.

597
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,520
It will come with it.

598
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,640
I can see it now.

599
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,640
It's Rob the Robot.

600
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,440
He stores your data by stacking blocks or something really retarded.

601
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,800
He shoves it all in his dongle.

602
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

603
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Think about that.

604
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,440
Wouldn't that be cool if they made, like, a little USB storage device like Rob the Robot?

605
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
No, it won't happen.

606
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,120
I always thought they should release a miniature Rob the Robot that plugs into your DS and

607
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
game right now.

608
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,400
That plugs into his ass slot.

609
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
I'm sorry.

610
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,440
It's like those bikes on South Park.

611
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,560
I don't know if you ever...

612
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Forget it.

613
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,920
All they're saying is, I mean, don't say that you have a better idea of how to store data

614
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,800
because so far it has not worked.

615
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,120
I mean, your stupid archaic system of blocks is retarded, all right?

616
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,320
Use actual data that everybody uses, you know, kilobytes.

617
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,880
That's something that people are familiar nowadays.

618
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,880
People aren't, like, going, oh, it's a mystical device that connects through the Internet

619
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,000
via magic.

620
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,260
I mean, people aren't that dumb.

621
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,920
They do have a rudimentary understanding of how computers work, all right?

622
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,960
And to be honest, if they don't understand storage and stuff and what kilobytes mean,

623
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
guess what?

624
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,080
Maybe they'll learn to, you know, figure out what this is via their Wii.

625
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,680
I mean, that's a great idea.

626
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,480
Instead, no, we're going to make it, we're just going to pander to the idiots and figure

627
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
out a way to do that.

628
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,680
Thank you, GS68, Wild Wacky Action Bike.

629
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,800
I'm waiting for that attachment to come out on Wii, just so you know.

630
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm telling you, man, whatever it's going to be, I'm just ready for a disappointment.

631
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,640
We need Wild Wacky Action Bike Wii.

632
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,280
It would sell like crazy, and you know it.

633
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,800
It's seriously, whatever they're going to announce at E3 is just going to be a disappointment.

634
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
All right.

635
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
But we are getting a dongle, right?

636
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
We might.

637
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,920
They're going to, seriously, they're going to be like, we've been working on this for

638
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,200
years, and it's a Nintendo-branded SD card.

639
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Fuck yourselves.

640
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Bye.

641
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,360
Well, we'll see what happens.

642
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,480
I don't plan on any of my stupid little boycott just yet, because most stuff I want that's

643
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,960
been coming out on Wii lately, namely the Strong Bad Games, have also been coming out

644
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
on PC.

645
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Problem fixed.

646
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,440
Well, I'm still going to be downloading Choaniki behind my husband's back.

647
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,160
Ooh, I like Charan's comment, a Wild Wacky Action Dongle.

648
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Ooh!

649
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,120
That could be like an OLR dream game.

650
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,640
And by the way, I was gifted Choaniki this week.

651
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
So much to gift me.

652
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
Thank you.

653
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Heart.

654
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Gift me next.

655
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
Gifts?

656
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,920
I can't break my boycott when people give me gifts.

657
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,040
I forgot to remind you to take the Wii Fit.

658
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,120
Oh, that's alright, I'll get it next week, or something.

659
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
More news!

660
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
More news!

661
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Dun dun dun!

662
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,840
Mega Man 9, for everyone who has been happy and excited and getting a little bit flickery

663
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,640
giddy about it, it actually has a Japanese release date now.

664
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,920
Mega Man 9 is supposed to be out in Japan on September 24th for a thousand Wii points.

665
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,160
We don't have our date here yet, or in Europe, but Capcom loves us.

666
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,240
At least they better, bitches.

667
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,560
I'm sure it'll be here soon.

668
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,800
No, but seriously, seriously, seriously.

669
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:23,640
It was actually reported, I do believe, by Dengeki Online, the release date, so not too

670
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,640
bad.

671
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,160
So I'm looking forward to it.

672
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,520
I would honestly think that we'd probably get it close to the same day.

673
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,920
I was gonna say, is odds looking good we'll get it around the same day?

674
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,360
I hope so.

675
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
Be nice.

676
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Maybe.

677
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,240
Well, if you can't wait that long, you'll be happy to know that Strong Bad, episode

678
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:50,080
2, Strong Baddie of the Free, will be releasing this Monday on WiiWare and on the PC.

679
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
Woohoo!

680
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,320
And I have no idea what's gonna be happening in the game, because 1, I didn't play the

681
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,640
first one, and 2, I don't really visit the websites.

682
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,120
More of the wonderful humor that was in the first game.

683
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Of course.

684
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
It's episode 2.

685
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
It's awesome.

686
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,560
It's like you watch a TV series, this is episode 2.

687
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,880
Like you watch a show like South Park and episode 1 was funny, so you tune into episode

688
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
2.

689
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
That's the whole thing.

690
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,080
And then things get angsty in episode 2.

691
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,240
Yes.

692
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,040
And you know, characters start sleeping with each other and form these complex relationships.

693
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,880
No, I totally made that up.

694
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,720
But that would be interesting.

695
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,920
I think you've been watching too much daytime TV, right?

696
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,920
No, just 90210.

697
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Alright.

698
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,560
Just kidding.

699
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,040
Moving on, something else is coming out on the Wii quite soon.

700
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,840
Wii Music, and you know, we've had certainly mixed opinions on Wii Music, but sometimes

701
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,680
I kind of think that Nintendo does these kinds of things just to kind of impress us.

702
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,600
Like try to get a certain niche audience.

703
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,880
That's right, you are hearing in the background cowbell in Wii Music.

704
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,120
Wii Music is actually getting cowbell.

705
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,720
And they're actually demoing it there.

706
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,920
You can actually check out a little trailer there.

707
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,500
It's hit game trailers, but it's also on Nintendo's site.

708
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:11,260
So insert your needs more cowbell joke here, because it's probably what got this in the

709
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,260
game.

710
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,580
Somebody at Nintendo thought, heh, joke, funny.

711
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,760
Or that the cowbell is actually considered a real instrument, which in some ways it really

712
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
is.

713
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,000
The cowbell isn't, I actually got through this music store at Hayton Ashbury, that has

714
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,480
like cowbells with features.

715
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,840
I'm like dude, it's like cowbell.

716
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Electronic cowbell.

717
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,040
Oh, this one's got extra muting, and this one has tone change, and this one's got this.

718
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,160
I'm like dude, it's cowbell.

719
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
You bang it with a stick.

720
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,760
I played the electric cowbell.

721
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,320
I know, electric cowbell, that'd be awesome.

722
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
Amplified cowbell.

723
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Amplified cowbell.

724
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,160
Like a cowbell that sounds like a gong every time you hit it.

725
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,360
A cowbell doesn't vibrate like that.

726
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,560
Do you get to play gong in Wii music?

727
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,760
That would be kind of awesome.

728
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,200
No, but I will gong Wii music.

729
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,680
Alright.

730
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,720
Wii music is getting more cowbell.

731
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Haters!

732
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
There you go.

733
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,160
Well, this is something that I love.

734
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,800
Very happy about this.

735
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:15,240
There have been ratings put out for the Australian OFLC board for Castlevania III Dracula's Curse.

736
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,120
That'll be for a virtual console, and they gave it a G rating.

737
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,800
So that's fairly indicative that we're going to be getting it to be joining all the others

738
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,120
that are already there.

739
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,640
Isn't that nice?

740
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,400
It's wonderful news, because Castlevania III is one of the best.

741
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Really.

742
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
One thing I hope.

743
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Really.

744
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.

745
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,720
That it's like the Japanese version.

746
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,920
I somehow knew you were going to go there and get into the whole discussion about the

747
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,200
extra sound or whatever.

748
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
No, that wasn't it.

749
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
I thought that was what it was.

750
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,160
When you played Grant, you know, the one who walks, who climbs on the ceiling and everything?

751
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Hell yeah!

752
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,560
How can you forget Grant if you've ever played Castlevania III?

753
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,880
Well, he throws his knife instead of just stabs, so he actually has a ranged attack.

754
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,160
Oh, so he's actually useful.

755
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Yes.

756
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Oh, nice.

757
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,800
Because I always used the one that had the fire ice.

758
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Cypher?

759
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Yeah.

760
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,120
But what's the point in him throwing knives if he can have a sub-weapon of throwing knives?

761
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,840
I don't think he can.

762
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,080
Wasn't there something else, too, with Castlevania, and it's that the Famicom since it had like

763
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
an extra sound?

764
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,480
Didn't it have an extra sound processor or something?

765
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
I think it did.

766
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:19,440
I think if I'm correct, it ran off the disc, and the disc system did actually have, like

767
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,360
have you ever heard the Legend of Zelda for the Famicom disc?

768
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,200
Had actually really nice music in it.

769
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Oh, okay.

770
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,800
So it was the difference in the sound processors, too.

771
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Little known fact, the Famicom disc system had a sound channel for porno soundtracks.

772
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What?

773
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
True.

774
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
False.

775
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Absolutely true.

776
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
What?

777
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Really?

778
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I wouldn't lie.

779
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Absolutely true.

780
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Yes, you would.

781
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,640
Game Guru in chat says, JP will get JP version, US will get US version.

782
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,720
Sad but true, but well, or if it's easier to not emulate off the disc system, because

783
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,840
I don't think there have been any disc games that have come to Virtual Console, maybe JP

784
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
will get US version.

785
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,560
No, it's going to be the US version.

786
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
We got Excitebike, didn't we?

787
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,280
Oh, that's true, we did.

788
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,120
No, but Excitebike wasn't the disc version.

789
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,480
What did they do with the save load?

790
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,360
Even here in America, though, remember, we got the cartridge and it still had save load,

791
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,600
and it would just crash your game if you tried to use it, which I thought was one of the

792
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,640
most hilarious things ever on the old school Nintendo, that they just left it in there

793
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
when we didn't have the attachment.

794
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Awesome.

795
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,160
Well, if I was right, the entire game was done in English anyway.

796
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Hmm.

797
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,280
If only Nintendo knew they were setting trends with Excitebike that soon will be followed

798
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,520
by large companies like EA releasing games that are broken.

799
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Awesome.

800
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,840
I think Gyromite also had it, if I'm right, but no, it didn't, because Gyromite was the

801
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,160
one that my husband and I went through like 15 copies of when he had his used game store,

802
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,680
and took out the converter cartridge so that we could make our own converter.

803
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Oh, nice.

804
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
Nice.

805
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
Yeah.

806
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,760
There were actually that many copies of Gyromite in circulation, that many Rob the Robot sold.

807
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
My friend had one.

808
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
We have one.

809
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
I knew one friend that had one.

810
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
We have one.

811
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
What did they really do?

812
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Like nothing.

813
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
They had the little spinny thing.

814
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
It was a selling point, that's it.

815
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
It didn't do anything.

816
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,720
You can play three games with this thing, and he's going to look cool, and then that's

817
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
it.

818
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
He looks like Johnny Five.

819
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,080
I mean, a lot of people don't really understand what Rob the Robot actually did.

820
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,060
Like basically, didn't he just, like he had these little spinning disks that you would

821
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,720
put down, like these little top things that you would put down on these giant things that

822
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,600
just pressed your controller?

823
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Pretty much.

824
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
It was-

825
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
It was-

826
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Rob, it was a selling point.

827
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,560
It was amazingly stupid in retrospect, and I realized that Rob the Robot is like pop

828
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,840
culture cool, and everybody like laughed when they saw him in Brawl, but if you think about

829
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:46,160
it, Rob the Robot was really stupid, like in all actuality.

830
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,600
But anyhow, sorry, let's move on to some release dates.

831
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,880
Rob, like I said, it was a selling point.

832
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,720
Yeah, because people look at the box, and you think-

833
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,920
Nintendo does what Genesis don't.

834
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,280
You think that Rob the Robot is going to vacuum your house, but that's not what it does.

835
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
It does nothing.

836
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,640
Yeah, you're going to have to dust off Rob the Robot once in a while.

837
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,840
All right, look, enough bitterness.

838
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,200
Let's get to some release dates around the world, Loki.

839
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,660
Rob the Robot just exudes awesome.

840
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,120
That's what Rob the Robot does.

841
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
He exudes fail.

842
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
That's what Rob the Robot does.

843
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Exudes awesome.

844
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Okay, so today, we had Rock Band 2 come out on the 360.

845
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:27,320
For everybody else that's on other platforms, you wait till October.

846
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:36,280
Anyways, on PC this week, we've got Stalker Clear Sky, Cabela's Big Game Hunter 09 Legendary

847
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:43,080
Adventures, and that's also coming out on the PlayStation 2 Wii, and I believe that's

848
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,720
it.

849
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,960
Let's see here, Star Wars The Force Unleashed will be coming out on pretty much every system

850
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,440
out there.

851
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,760
Not any retro systems, all current systems, until someone makes a joke.

852
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,480
Drawn to Life, Spongebob Squarepants Edition.

853
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
This is funny.

854
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,800
They have on this list, Destroy All Humans, Big Willy Unleashed.

855
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,400
Oh, that game's been canceled.

856
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,200
TNA Impact coming out on the Wii this week, delayed from last week.

857
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,680
Crisis Warhead on PC, I like how they had that PC built for it, even though this game

858
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:24,720
is more, I don't know, it's meant for lower end PCs.

859
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,240
The Witcher Enhanced Edition on PC.

860
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,560
We have Hell's Kitchen coming out on PC this week.

861
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,980
Armored Core for Answer on PS3 and Xbox 360.

862
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,960
We have Igor coming out on PC, DS, and the Wii.

863
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,200
Line Rider 2 Unbound on PC and DS.

864
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,800
Dance Dance Revolution X on PlayStation 2.

865
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,520
Enchanted Unicorn on PC.

866
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,600
Kid Supports Crazy Golf on the Wii, that game's gonna suck, it's Data Design Interactive.

867
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,680
Bratz Ponies 2 on DS.

868
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,160
Dragon Quest IV, Chapters of the Chosen on DS.

869
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Battle of Fantasia on 360.

870
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,960
My Secret World by Imagine, the same people did that Imagine Baby stuff, and it's a diary.

871
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,800
Yay, a diary!

872
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:28,080
Up here on PS3, 360, and PC, we got Super Pickups on the Wii, Unsolved Crimes on the

873
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,880
DS, Zoo Hospital on the Wii, apparently it's like Trauma Center meets, like, a pet hospital,

874
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,320
it's kinda neat.

875
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,960
Red Bull BC-1, that game I've been kinda talking about for a while now, check it out, it's

876
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
on the DS.

877
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,880
And let's see, there's some collections, retro collections coming out from Namco, they have

878
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:59,480
the Naruto Ultimate Collection, which is Naruto the Ultimate Ninja 2 and 3, and Uzumaki Chronicles.

879
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,440
And then the Namco Classic Fighter Collection, which is Soul Calibur II Tekken 5, and, god,

880
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,040
I can't remember the last one.

881
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,440
And then Pac-Man Power Pack, which is a bunch of Pac-Man games.

882
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
Nothing good, unfortunately.

883
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,440
And I think that's all the big stuff, at least.

884
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,680
Alright, yeah, any price point, I know a lot of our listeners are probably into DDRX, any

885
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,120
price point for that?

886
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,560
I wanna say it's $40 for the game only, and for the bundle it's probably $49.99.

887
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,440
I would've thought maybe it came down a little bit in price, because PS2 is kinda, you know,

888
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
the last...

889
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,200
It may have, I'm just going off memory, and that's, you know, not exactly accurate.

890
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,920
Alright, so don't take that as the final word.

891
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,040
Here, give me one second, I can tell you.

892
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,840
Well, let me do the Japanese release dates, then you can kinda jump in whenever you find

893
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
it.

894
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,320
Going over to the Japanese release dates, Star Wars The Force Unleashed is coming into

895
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:55,480
the Asian regions around Japan, and on all those other consoles as well.

896
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,640
As far as Japan, Japan itself is getting Unreal Tournament 3 on the Xbox 360 this week, on

897
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,560
the 18th, for those folks that like the first-person shooters over there.

898
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,080
I know the scene's not quite as big over there, but they've got some fans of it.

899
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,880
Some PlayStation 3 games getting a price reduction this week, including Def Jam Icon and Fight

900
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
Knight Round 3.

901
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,560
Again, those are price reductions on the PlayStation 3, down to about $30 US.

902
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,920
Some other games coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 3, GI Jockey 4 2008, and Winning

903
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,040
Post 7 in a combo pack, or, of course, you can just get the game GI Jockey 4 by itself.

904
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,640
Also, Trusty Bell, Shoupan no Yume, you might know this here as Eternal Sonata, finally

905
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,360
comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

906
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,760
It's $29.99 for the game only.

907
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Much better.

908
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
Good.

909
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,280
Unreal Tournament 3 also comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week, so be on the lookout

910
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,820
for that.

911
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,760
Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo Wii, we have Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles getting

912
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
a price reduction.

913
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,560
You know that, of course, as Resident Evil.

914
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,200
GI Jockey Wii 2008 as well.

915
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,000
Kororimpa gets a price reduction.

916
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,280
Bomberman comes out next week, so be on the lookout for that.

917
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,120
That's actually on next week's list, on the 25th.

918
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,760
Moving on to the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 2 still getting a lot of love.

919
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,920
Hyper Street Fighter 2, the Anniversary Edition and Vampire Darkstalkers Collection value

920
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,920
pack.

921
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:27,400
So, for you old-school 2D Capcom fighting fans, a little PS2 pack coming out for you

922
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
guys.

923
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,400
That's happiness.

924
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:36,640
GI Jockey 4 2008 also gets a version on PlayStation 2 and gets a combo pack with Winning Post

925
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,200
7, also on PlayStation 2.

926
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,960
And a game called Heart no Kuni no Alice is coming out as well on the PlayStation 2.

927
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,720
Let's take a look at the handheld systems, starting off on the Nintendo DS.

928
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,200
Dragon Ball DS comes out this week from Namco Bandai.

929
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,240
Lumi's Sleight, Hikari no Puzzle as well.

930
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,960
Long Vacation, Iruka Toel Watashi comes out.

931
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:09,880
And Oshishi Keiji, Keiji-san Watashi Ga Arimashita comes out from success.

932
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,480
And we'll see if it will be a success over in Japan, although probably not.

933
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,480
I've never heard of it.

934
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,920
On the Sony PlayStation Portable, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G Hunter Leather Cover.

935
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,960
So that's not a game.

936
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,480
It's just something to match all the Monster Hunter games that you have for your PlayStation

937
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
Portable.

938
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,280
But if you actually want a new game, you can get Samurai Dou Portable is the name of that

939
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
game.

940
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,800
And I'm not sure if that's a fighting game or what type of game that is.

941
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,360
It looks to be an action-based game.

942
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,520
I don't think it's a fighting game, though.

943
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,720
I think it's a hack-and-slash type PSP game.

944
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,600
It's rated 15-plus or 0C, so you know there's going to be some good blood.

945
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Hooray!

946
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Blood!

947
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,600
Gore!

948
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
That's it for your Japanese release dates.

949
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:59,160
For the UK, we have the 18th Warhammer Online, for the 19th is everything else.

950
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:06,280
Destroy All Humans Path of Furon, Hell's Kitchen the video game, Play TV for PlayStation 3,

951
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:15,360
Open City Creator, Star Wars The Force Unleashed, also STCC The Game, The Witcher Enhanced Edition,

952
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,600
and Tim Stockdale's Writing Star.

953
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,040
Oh, and also Yakuza 2.

954
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,040
That's it?

955
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,040
That's it.

956
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,560
You know, The Force Unleashed, we all mentioned that in our respective releases.

957
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,600
It's practically a worldwide release this week.

958
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,720
But one thing that's kind of interesting about it, one thing I was reading about on the internet,

959
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,680
I was trying to see if GameStop was doing a Rock Band 2 midnight release, because I

960
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,040
really just didn't want to go to Walmart, but it was pretty much the only thing that

961
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,880
was open, and yes, I had to have the game at 1201, even though I didn't get it until

962
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,880
1230.

963
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,800
But anyway, apparently the reason why GameStop did not do a midnight release for Rock Band

964
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,160
2 is because a lot of them are doing midnight releases for Force Unleashed, and they just

965
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,600
didn't want to pay all that extra salary.

966
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,680
A lot of people, I mean, I would see why they're doing that, because The Force Unleashed is

967
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,840
coming out on a lot more systems, and a lot of people might not be interested in the game-only

968
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,640
version of Rock Band.

969
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,120
And there's a lot of rabid Star Wars fans.

970
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,120
I mean, really.

971
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,280
So, I mean, I can understand why they would do that, but oh well.

972
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,840
VXJsonXV played Hell's Kitchen the game in our chat room, and he laughs hahaha and said,

973
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,560
I played Fox's Flash version of that.

974
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,560
It was silly.

975
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,240
Yeah, and you know what's funny is that Flash version of it is pretty much what you're getting

976
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,880
on the Wii and the DS.

977
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,880
Nice.

978
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,320
It's crap, so.

979
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,680
Frisbee says, bake that fucking bread now!

980
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,320
Sadly, I don't think the Wii version of the game will swear at you, which is the only

981
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,160
reason to watch Hell's Kitchen.

982
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,160
I don't get it.

983
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,600
Like, if you're not going to get berated by your Nintendo Wii, what's the point?

984
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,240
Now you're just playing, like, Cake Mania with some fire.

985
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:51,520
It's basically just, like, Cooking Mama mixed with American Idol, you know, where they berate

986
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,320
you based on your performance.

987
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
Sounds kind of fail-tastic.

988
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
It is fail-tastic.

989
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:03,740
So, anyways, at least some people have, I don't know, a good sense of humor about people

990
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,120
breaking street dates.

991
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:12,560
Rock Band 2, people that managed to get their copies early were welcomed with custom screens

992
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,600
taunting them from, I guess, Harmonic Central, including, welcome to Rock Band 2, nice work

993
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,800
on scoring this game before it comes out.

994
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,520
I remember there was another one on the day after that or so that was saying, you know,

995
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,120
try our impossible set list or something, see if you're worthy of owning the game early

996
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,120
and stuff like that.

997
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,200
So it was kind of funny.

998
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,920
And then, of course, for those people that finally picked up their copy, you'll be greeted

999
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:47,400
with some new tracks to download this Tuesday, including the Megadeth album Peace Sells,

1000
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:56,600
Who's Buying, and they've got, it looks like, about seven songs available there for two

1001
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:01,280
bucks each or you can buy the whole pack for eleven bucks, so you save a few bucks there.

1002
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,560
Remember back in the day when like eight marathon songs was an album?

1003
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,680
Like, you know, you'd get eight songs from a rock band, but they would be just like effing

1004
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,520
epic rock songs, like seven, eight minutes in length?

1005
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Megadeth.

1006
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Awesome.

1007
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,520
Megadeth was awesome.

1008
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:22,280
And then also, if that's not your cup of tea, they have the Rock Band Tour Pack, which includes

1009
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,260
One of Those Nights by The Cab, Hands Down by Dashboard Confessional, She's a Handsome

1010
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,860
Woman by Panic at the Disco, and Natural Disaster by Plain White Teas.

1011
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:36,800
All those are available for a buck or 80 Microsoft points, or you can buy the whole pack for

1012
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,800
four dollars.

1013
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,200
So you're saving zero money.

1014
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
Nice.

1015
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:47,320
By the way, speaking of rock band download stuff, I know our one and only Dark Sakura,

1016
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,240
one thing she loves almost more than video games is Gorillaz, and therefore Blur, because

1017
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,120
you know, the whole Damon Auburn connection.

1018
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,320
I know!

1019
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,720
I did check out Beetlebum, which is available in the Rock Band Store.

1020
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,800
It is a cover, if you weren't already aware.

1021
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,800
It's not horrible.

1022
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
It's not worth having.

1023
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,840
It's not horrible.

1024
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,820
At least you have the song, because, you know, ideally you're supposed to get someone else

1025
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,720
to sing to it anyway, but it is a cover, if you didn't know and already know.

1026
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,160
Well, if you do sing it, you have to do the really, you know, extra thick accent that

1027
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,800
he affects for the song.

1028
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,800
Exactly.

1029
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,640
You know, and I realize this is like the quintessential Blur song, but we have to have song two come

1030
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,640
out at some point.

1031
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
I mean, come on.

1032
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,200
Either that, or There's No Other Way.

1033
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,200
Or Boys and Girls.

1034
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
I like that song.

1035
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,200
Well, you know, my favorite is.

1036
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,200
I like Coffee and TV too.

1037
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,200
That's a good song.

1038
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,200
Anyhow.

1039
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,960
But, but they probably aren't going to have anything off of the later two Blur albums

1040
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,200
because they're very kind of at least in this country.

1041
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,200
Does anybody know this?

1042
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,640
Did this weren't as big here?

1043
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,520
Oasis was a weird album.

1044
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Yeah.

1045
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,520
All right.

1046
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,520
Anyhow.

1047
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,520
Sorry.

1048
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,520
Enough Blur dish.

1049
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,520
By the way, I love the fact that the rock band people were so kind of, you know, funny

1050
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,680
about the early release dates because true story, I have a friend of mine who is, uh,

1051
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,520
who got the game early and was paranoid to go on Xbox live with the game, having it like

1052
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,020
the Tuesday before, because he thought that they were going to like, you know, track him

1053
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,920
and report him or something like that.

1054
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,840
So I found this whole thing really funny because I sent a link to one of the blogs that had

1055
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,800
a picture of the thing and I put, what are you so afraid of now?

1056
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,180
You big chicken.

1057
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:25,160
So I thought it was funny that, you know, everybody's afraid to go online, like they're

1058
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,280
going to get busted and banned or something.

1059
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,280
Yeah.

1060
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,640
And harmonics really didn't seem to give us some of the, uh, we were playing that last

1061
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:37,240
night and some of the, um, uh, like vocal sections in the game were kind of easy to

1062
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
hit.

1063
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,240
I remember, was it Jim?

1064
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,240
Um, sabotage.

1065
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,240
Right.

1066
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,880
He would know what you want, what you want, he was just like kind of blah, blah, blah.

1067
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,880
He's like drunk.

1068
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,520
So, you know, he was just, that's what he was literally kind of yelling and he was like,

1069
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,520
awesome.

1070
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,520
I don't know.

1071
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,000
I thought it was funny.

1072
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,160
And then Irene, if you've listened to this show long enough, you know, rice princess

1073
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,560
was making up new lyrics and saying something about my butt to all these songs, which was

1074
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,440
very rude in my opinion.

1075
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,440
Very rude.

1076
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,400
Anyhow, thank God that there was no video camera there so it can be on YouTube.

1077
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,400
All right.

1078
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,420
Uh, let's talk about Guitar Hero for a minute cause you know, Guitar Hero is coming out

1079
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,560
pretty soon and they're going to be having a, you know, their whole little kit.

1080
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,320
They've got the, uh, drums and the guitar and I'm looking forward to this cause I need

1081
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,040
a new guitar and I kind of really want the new Guitar Hero guitar.

1082
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,900
Um, well, not only do you already know about the bundle, but now you know exactly what

1083
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,960
songs you're going to be getting in the game.

1084
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,760
I'm not going to read the entire song list.

1085
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,280
You can probably just Google Guitar Hero World Tour song list.

1086
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,600
You'll find the whole thing, but I do want to point out some highlights of the song list,

1087
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
at least in my mind.

1088
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,600
I'm sure everybody feels differently.

1089
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:50,480
Uh, 311, Beautiful Disaster, Beastie Boys, No Sleep Till Brooklyn, Billy Idol, Rebel

1090
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,280
Yell, Blink 182, Damn It, Blondie, One Way or Another, Bon Jovi, Living on a Prayer,

1091
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,840
even though that's in rock band, Coldplay, Shiver, The Doors, Love Me Two Times, The

1092
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:07,280
Eagles, Hotel California, Filter, Hey Man, Nice Shot, I like that song a lot, Fleetwood

1093
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,200
Matt, Go Your Own Way, although again that's in rock band, Foo Fighters, Everlong, also

1094
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,960
in rock band, Guess Who, American Woman, also I believe that is in rock band.

1095
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,480
So there's quite a bit of overlap.

1096
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,320
Um, Jimi Hendrix, Purple Haze, and The Wind Cries Mary, that's pretty cool they have Jimi

1097
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,320
Hendrix.

1098
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,360
Uh, the other kind of Jimi, Jimi Eat World with The Middle, Korn with Freak on a Leash,

1099
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,440
Lenny Kravitz, Are You Gonna Go My Way, that is like the quintessential guitar song in

1100
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,440
my opinion.

1101
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,800
That's a fucking rad guitar song, I can't wait to play that.

1102
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,960
Uh, Linkin Park, but who cares.

1103
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,920
Leonard Skynyrd, Sweet Home Alabama, live.

1104
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Really sweet.

1105
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,040
Yes, and I know you're an Alabama girl so you'll like that.

1106
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,080
Metallica, Trapped Under Ice, Michael Jackson, Beat It, that's kind of awesome.

1107
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,640
I wasn't expecting that one.

1108
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:57,440
Uh, Muse with Assassin, Nirvana with the Unplugged version of About a Girl, that's pretty rad.

1109
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,400
No Doubt with Spiderwebs, No FX, Sold Out, Ozzy Osbourne with Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley,

1110
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:09,120
uh, Pat Benatar, Heartbreaker, R.E.M., the one I love, Smashing Pumpkins Today, although

1111
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,120
that's in rock band.

1112
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,520
Uh, I knew I said I wasn't going to read this whole thing but I kind of am.

1113
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,320
Survivor, Eye of the Tiger, which is also in rock band but you know everybody loves

1114
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,320
that song.

1115
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,560
Sublime with Santeria, I don't really care for that song myself.

1116
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,880
But a lot of people do.

1117
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,560
Tool, three songs by Tool in the game.

1118
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,560
I like Tool.

1119
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:33,960
Uh, Para, Parabola, Schism and uh, Vicarious, Schism, I don't listen to Tool, I don't like

1120
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
them actually.

1121
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,960
But that's just...

1122
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,960
Well, whatever.

1123
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,800
Um, Van Halen, Hot for Teacher, that was a song that got played over and over again at

1124
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,040
Penny Arcade Expo.

1125
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,160
And Wings with Band on the Run.

1126
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,120
Cause you know we needed some wings in Guitar Hero.

1127
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,600
So there you go, Guitar Hero World Tour and uh, definitely, definitely a lot of very guitar

1128
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
centric songs.

1129
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,000
You know, especially with Jimi Hendrix, The Doors.

1130
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That's pretty awesome.

1131
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,400
I'm surprised that they don't do like any, I wish they would have more songs like Beat

1132
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,400
It and stuff like that.

1133
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
Yeah, I know.

1134
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
Like pop crossovers and stuff.

1135
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,320
We need a pop band or a pop hero or something.

1136
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,800
Not even necessarily have to do that but some download packs.

1137
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,280
Like I don't understand why there isn't more Michael Jackson stuff in there cause Beat

1138
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,020
It works and you might even be able to do like Thriller and stuff.

1139
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:21,360
Just like stuff that had a lot of guitar and stuff in the background.

1140
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,080
Dude, Thriller needs to be downloaded content.

1141
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,600
Make it happen.

1142
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,600
Lovely folks.

1143
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,920
And like also like country stuff.

1144
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,520
I mean there's that one song, Rockstar, that would work pretty well.

1145
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,680
Um, I'm just surprised there's not a lot of that stuff.

1146
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,380
It may not be enough for its own game but you know at least throw some download content

1147
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,380
out there.

1148
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,820
I'm sure people would appreciate, you know, appealing to a broad, or broader audience

1149
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,820
I guess.

1150
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:51,480
Alright, well there you have it, the Guitar Hero World Tour set list and a lot of guitar

1151
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,640
fans very excited about this game.

1152
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:01,120
Well, in other exciting news, and this is uh, actually I think it's pretty cool, um,

1153
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,000
Rob, do you ever watch Comedy Central?

1154
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Of course!

1155
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I love Comedy Central.

1156
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
That's where I get South Park.

1157
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
What's your favorite show besides South Park?

1158
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
South Park.

1159
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
My favorite show besides South Park?

1160
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
The Daily Show.

1161
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Okay, well I forgive you.

1162
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,560
That actually is a good show but, um, for a...

1163
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,880
My third favorite show?

1164
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,880
Yes.

1165
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,880
The Colbert Report.

1166
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,880
Good for you!

1167
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,880
Alright.

1168
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,880
Here you go.

1169
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,680
Because, um, Stephen Colbert is going to have a song in Rock Band.

1170
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,680
Awesome.

1171
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:34,160
Yes, um, Charlene is going to be available as a free download for Rock Band so everyone

1172
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,640
has to go get it right now.

1173
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,720
Yes, it is actually available now.

1174
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,720
Yes.

1175
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,560
But it's one of those blink and you miss it things.

1176
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
Get it!

1177
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,420
Yeah, because if you go into Rock Band you won't see it in the new releases.

1178
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,040
It's only in the library.

1179
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,840
And if anyone wants to familiarize themselves with it, while they already should be, except

1180
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,200
that I'm not really all that familiar with it, um, you can actually watch the video on

1181
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,880
YouTube as well.

1182
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,480
So go watch it after the show.

1183
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,840
The song's only like a minute long and it's not that difficult either.

1184
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,160
I've heard people are getting their achievements with it.

1185
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,200
All the more random.

1186
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,240
The lyrics are very funny.

1187
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,600
It enables the players to achieve more.

1188
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,080
Actually, we can play a little clip from Charlene.

1189
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,080
It's only like a minute long.

1190
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,080
Please do.

1191
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,080
I'm near you, I think of you.

1192
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,080
I think of you when I dream of you and I'm taking pictures of you.

1193
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:30,080
I think of you when I'm in a blimp looking down from up above you.

1194
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:36,680
You know I'm missing you.

1195
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,240
I love the synthesizer in this song.

1196
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
My mind is kissing you.

1197
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:45,360
I'm right behind you now, Charlene, waiting one last time.

1198
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,360
Oh, nice.

1199
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,360
Reminds me of my ex.

1200
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,360
All right.

1201
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,360
Oh my god, that's so wrong.

1202
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,760
There you have it.

1203
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,760
So wrong.

1204
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,760
Oh my god.

1205
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,920
There'll be a couple people listening to the show that understand that.

1206
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,560
All right, let's move on quickly.

1207
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:03,120
Anyway, speaking of appealing to a broader audience, SingStar is releasing a country

1208
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:12,320
version which will be coming to the PlayStation 2 on October 28th, and you can find, I guess,

1209
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:23,560
songs from Kelly Pickler, Keith Urban, Montgomery, Gentry, and among others.

1210
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,800
And yeah, it's kind of interesting.

1211
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,760
Also they're going to be localizing SingStar Legends as well, which is supposed to be coming

1212
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:35,520
out the same day, and that has a bunch of pop legend stuff.

1213
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:42,720
You can probably guess that all your favorite stuff, maybe some Cher thrown in there.

1214
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,720
Oh, hooray.

1215
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,880
Yeah, because you can't have enough Cher.

1216
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,880
Never.

1217
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,880
Never.

1218
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,880
Never.

1219
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,160
So that's pretty much what's going on in SingStar World?

1220
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,400
Yes, lots of releases for SingStar on PlayStation 2.

1221
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,380
However, you can import all that stuff into your PS3.

1222
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,920
How dare you?

1223
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,680
How dare you, Loki?

1224
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:07,040
How dare you talk about SingStar and not talk about the most important announcement of all

1225
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,260
time?

1226
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:14,360
This is the greatest moment in video game history happened this week around SingStar,

1227
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,000
and Loki just somehow missed it.

1228
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,980
It's a decider who wins the console war, right?

1229
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:26,760
The console war has been won this week by Sony PlayStation 3, and it's all because of

1230
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,120
ABBA.

1231
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,120
That's right.

1232
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:39,160
SingStar ABBA was announced this week by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe for release

1233
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:46,440
on the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation 3 later this year, and so you can sing hits

1234
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,440
like Waterloo.

1235
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:59,760
Let's take a listen.

1236
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,760
This was one of those moments, and then God spoke, and he said, let there be ABBA, and

1237
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,680
there was, and Sony won the war.

1238
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,280
There it is.

1239
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,600
I mean, let's just end the fucking show, because there's no other news that's going to top

1240
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,600
this.

1241
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
Does that mean we can go home now?

1242
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,240
I don't know why, but it's just going to be pathetic.

1243
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,480
Well, I don't know.

1244
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,320
I still think that my story was the best story ever.

1245
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,920
Well, Stephen Colbert is pretty cool.

1246
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,920
We'll try, Rob.

1247
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,920
Try to find something fun.

1248
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,920
I will find something fun.

1249
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,080
Let's talk about DJ Hero.

1250
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,460
There's a lot of people that are very excited about DJ Hero, because they think it's going

1251
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,460
to be BeatMania 2DX.

1252
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:39,960
It's going to be like, you know, the answer to BeatMania 2DX by the folks who did Guitar

1253
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,960
Hero.

1254
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,800
Well, you'd be kind of like half right, because it's not really going to be like BeatMania

1255
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,800
2DX.

1256
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,520
If you were thinking of a controller with a turntable and five buttons, not really.

1257
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,060
It actually sounds like it's going to be a lot different.

1258
00:59:55,060 --> 01:00:02,160
Some information has leaked from inside sources of a new pioneer little hookup for this thing.

1259
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,880
I guess this is just a mockup, but this is to get you to think of what it would look

1260
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,880
like.

1261
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,360
So if you imagine one of these things, you could hit this little turntable, and there's

1262
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,080
actually going to be little effector buttons on it.

1263
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,160
It's like a version of one of those type of decks.

1264
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,880
You use these little effector buttons and a crossfader to actually drop samples.

1265
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:24,560
So if you ever thought, like, hey, BeatMania isn't really like DJing, now you have a game

1266
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,160
that is actually kind of DJing, you know what I mean?

1267
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,160
Which is kind of cool.

1268
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,400
Well, I think it's different.

1269
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,400
It's different, right?

1270
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
No, it's not.

1271
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Why?

1272
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,400
Why are you so negative?

1273
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,880
Okay, well, the description that they had for this is basically, the screen's going

1274
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,440
to be set up where you're going to see kind of like a bottom half of a record, and the

1275
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,160
notes or whatever will be coming along, I guess, like three different tracks, and basically

1276
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,760
you have to hold those effector buttons down while you scratch.

1277
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,760
Hmm.

1278
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,760
Let's see here.

1279
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:59,680
If we take the scratch and replace it with strum, and we turn the effector buttons into

1280
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,500
fret buttons, we have Guitar Hero.

1281
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,440
So really, it's just re-skinning Guitar Hero to put different music in it.

1282
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,440
Well, but in a way, but think about this.

1283
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,440
This does sound kind of cool.

1284
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,320
Let's say the wireless controller apparently is actually grooved to fit in your lap, so

1285
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,000
you can actually sit this thing in your lap and play with it in your lap, which is kind

1286
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
of cool.

1287
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And then get this.

1288
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,720
Apparently, now this is the part where I have to spend a little disbelief.

1289
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,920
I think this is wishful thinking, but if it's true, it's pretty awesome.

1290
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,280
Apparently, the game song list is all mashups.

1291
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,600
Like it's all band versus band.

1292
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,600
Like what was that?

1293
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,680
Like the Grey Album, right?

1294
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,680
Metallica versus Beatles.

1295
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,140
Remember that was like a really famous mashup that supposedly...

1296
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,200
The Grey Album was Jay-Z and the Beatles.

1297
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,200
Oh, never mind.

1298
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Sorry.

1299
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,200
Jay-Z.

1300
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,200
Because I'm thinking of Metallica's Black Album.

1301
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,200
I know it was like a Black Album mixed with a White Album.

1302
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,400
But think of those types of things.

1303
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,200
It's supposed to be mashups is going to be the whole song list.

1304
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,200
You like mashups, don't you, Loki?

1305
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,000
I thought you loved that kind of stuff.

1306
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I don't know.

1307
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,400
I think this game is going to be...

1308
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:01,680
People will probably buy it because it's something that Activision is putting out, but I think

1309
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,680
it's going to be...

1310
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,280
If you're thinking it's going to be 2DX, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

1311
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,920
Well, we'll see what happens.

1312
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,520
No, it's not going to be 2DX, but it sounds like it could be cool.

1313
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,760
I don't necessarily need a copy of a game that's already out there and still selling

1314
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,760
in Japan.

1315
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,760
You know what I mean?

1316
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,360
I like the fact that it's kind of different.

1317
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,240
And they're also saying that they're supposed to do guitar co-op as well.

1318
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,240
I don't know.

1319
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,960
We'll have to see how it actually plays out, but I'm not too optimistic yet.

1320
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,140
What's interesting and possibly related is that almost within the same breath, Activision

1321
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,720
announced this week that they have acquired Freestyle Games.

1322
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,840
It's a UK-based developer, and they made the game B-Boy, which was on the PSP.

1323
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,800
I don't think it really sold like crazy, but it was a rhythm action game that was available

1324
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,040
on the PSP.

1325
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:49,320
And apparently what they're doing is they're developing a new music-based IP.

1326
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,320
Hmm...

1327
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,320
B-Boy?

1328
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,320
DJ Hero?

1329
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,320
Connection?

1330
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,040
Who knows?

1331
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:02,020
But it certainly is interesting that Freestyle Games was sucked into the Activision collective

1332
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,020
this week.

1333
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,020
So there you go.

1334
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,160
People will eat this up.

1335
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,680
As long as you do something innovative with it, you know, if you can mix actual MP3s or

1336
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,400
something like that, that might be kind of cool.

1337
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:19,960
But somehow I'm gonna set the bar a lot lower than, you know, I would like it to be.

1338
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,080
By the way, B-Boy was not just available on the PlayStation Portable, it is available

1339
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,800
on PlayStation 2 also in the United States.

1340
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,320
Yeah, it got released here a couple weeks ago.

1341
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,920
But it was probably one of those, again, kind of blink-and-you-miss-it sort of things.

1342
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,920
It was an alright game.

1343
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,920
Was it?

1344
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,920
I mean, it was okay.

1345
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,920
I had never even heard of it.

1346
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,920
You guys say blink-and-miss-it because I missed it.

1347
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,040
I played the PSP, the UK version of the PSP game a while back, and it was alright.

1348
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:42,560
It wasn't a lot to hold my attention for a long time, but it was pretty cool.

1349
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,560
Alright.

1350
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,560
Fair enough.

1351
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,560
Alright.

1352
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,560
Well, there you have it.

1353
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,560
We'll see.

1354
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,000
More information on DJ Hero may be made by these guys.

1355
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We'll see.

1356
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,480
Well, Sony is not happy.

1357
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,480
Not happy at all.

1358
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,480
Why?

1359
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,480
They should be elated.

1360
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,480
They have ABBA.

1361
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,440
Yeah, but the PSP people aren't happy.

1362
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,440
They want it all.

1363
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,560
And, I mean, as if ABBA wasn't big enough, they want everything.

1364
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,420
They want third-party support for the PSP.

1365
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,760
They're not very happy with it.

1366
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:18,560
Basically, the boss of Sony Worldwide Studios, Yoshida Shuhei, is basically saying that they'd

1367
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:25,120
like to see more third-party support on the PSP and that they're jealous because other

1368
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:29,400
people are getting third-party support and not them.

1369
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,520
He's quoted as saying it's really, really disappointing.

1370
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,240
I mean, it's so disappointing he had to use really twice.

1371
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,240
What?

1372
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,640
It didn't get the point across.

1373
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,160
And it's a lost opportunity for the third parties.

1374
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,480
They should look at what the PSP can do for their titles and the potential for the business

1375
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,940
that their IP has.

1376
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:54,640
They say, though, that Sony's got a whole bunch more things ready, but they are really

1377
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,560
wanting Capcom, maybe?

1378
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,680
But you know, the PSP 3000 is on its way.

1379
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,680
You know, I have the feeling that they're forgetting that there's a reason why there's

1380
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,320
developers not making games for the PSP because they've made games on the PSP in the past

1381
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,600
and they haven't sold well at all.

1382
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,240
I mean, that's kind of what it is.

1383
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,840
A lot of people are avoiding the PSP and not that it's a bad system.

1384
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:18,840
It's just...

1385
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,500
The DS is more fun.

1386
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Not even that.

1387
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,680
I wouldn't even go that far.

1388
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:28,000
It's just, there's a lot more people that own the DS because they're suckered into buying

1389
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,360
multiple colors for it, or God knows what.

1390
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,360
I don't know.

1391
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,520
I like the PSP a lot better than the DS, but I...

1392
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,520
But if you go back to that rule that a system is only as good as the games that are on it...

1393
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,520
Exactly.

1394
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,840
There's better games on DS in general, so people are going to go where the good games

1395
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,840
are.

1396
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,660
And in a way, this is what Sony's complaining about, is that the third parties aren't giving

1397
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:47,440
them what they need to sustain.

1398
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,400
Well, maybe start supporting the third parties a little bit more.

1399
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,880
Maybe do some innovative features to the PSP, like, you know, make voice chat a lot easier.

1400
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,960
Now that they have the microphone built in, they can do some stuff with that.

1401
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,960
Touchscreen.

1402
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,000
That might be kind of cool.

1403
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,880
Tilt sensors.

1404
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,840
I always kind of thought that the PSP's strength over the DS was that it was more of a kind

1405
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,140
of all-in-one type system.

1406
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,080
It was like part iPod, part game player, part web browser.

1407
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,320
It's just a little bit of everything for relatively low price.

1408
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,320
It depends on what you want, and if you...

1409
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,680
Like, for me, I have absolutely no reason to really play a PSP much except for a couple

1410
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,100
of games, really.

1411
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,880
If I was in high school, though, all over again, I would be all over this PSP.

1412
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,600
I mean, this would be a great thing to take to high school, I think, because you got it

1413
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,600
all right there.

1414
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,040
Well, when I was in high school, it was the Atari Lynx.

1415
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,920
Wow, if that.

1416
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,000
I didn't have one of those.

1417
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,120
I had a Game Boy Brick.

1418
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,920
Actually, it was the Turbo Express.

1419
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,640
I had a Game Boy Brick and a brick...

1420
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,640
And a Game Boy Brick.

1421
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,320
A gray case that I hauled it around in, it got stolen.

1422
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,200
I had a Game Boy Brick and a friend of mine had a Turbo Express.

1423
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,680
I was like, cool, I want one.

1424
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,680
But anyway.

1425
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,680
Hmm.

1426
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,720
Well, there's some other good things, though, coming to the PSP, and I know we don't talk

1427
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,760
about it too much, but they actually have a lot of games now on their PC store that

1428
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,800
you can download the full versions of.

1429
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:12,520
It's almost like a digital version of it, kind of like what they do with the PS1 Classics,

1430
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,600
included this new lineup of stuff.

1431
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:20,720
You're going to have Cube, Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords for $14.99, which is not bad.

1432
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,880
Work Time Fun for $10.

1433
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:30,040
You get PQ, PQ2, that one game that's kind of like IQ, the first one for $9.99, the second

1434
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:35,860
one for $14.99, and Deadhead Fred, which is kind of a sleeper game for $15.

1435
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:41,520
So they are releasing quite a bit of stuff on the PC store.

1436
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,200
I kind of think it's funny, though, that they have digital copies of it now, because, I

1437
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,760
mean, people have been doing that before in not such a legit way.

1438
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,480
But now they're encouraging it.

1439
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,680
And by the way, if you're listening to this show on a PSP, which a lot of our emailers

1440
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:00,040
and so on have told us that they do, you need to, like, pause the podcast right now, and

1441
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:05,240
you need to go to OLRPSP.com in your browser and check out the new Orange Lounge Radio

1442
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:09,680
All Games Tuner that's available on the downloads page there, because it's quite awesome.

1443
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,680
And we'll allow you to listen to the All Games Radio live feed right there from your crossbar

1444
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,920
without having to, like, hunt around for it.

1445
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,440
It's like one-click access to the show, which is great.

1446
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,800
It's great for you, because you find quality gaming radio fast.

1447
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,920
It's great for us, because we get more listeners easily.

1448
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,440
So install it on your friends' PSPs, too.

1449
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,000
Get their permission first, though.

1450
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
That's the nice thing to do.

1451
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
But, you know.

1452
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
You know, it's funny.

1453
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,400
Someone jokes about SingStar for PSP.

1454
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:37,680
I wouldn't doubt that they may have something like that in the future.

1455
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,680
Hmm.

1456
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,680
Interesting.

1457
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,680
We'll see.

1458
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,680
All right.

1459
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,680
Let's see.

1460
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:47,720
Moving on to another Sony-related story, and this is the type of game a lot of folks can

1461
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,720
get into.

1462
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,720
It's Kingdom Hearts.

1463
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:53,080
And a lot of people have kind of been wondering, when's the next Kingdom Hearts game gonna

1464
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,080
come out?

1465
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,400
Where's our information on Kingdom Hearts 3?

1466
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,760
Well, sadly, we don't have that.

1467
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,600
But what we did get from this week's GameStop Expo, which is kind of a meeting of all the

1468
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,960
important people at GameStop, happened this week.

1469
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,120
Apparently, a little piece slipped out about Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.

1470
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,960
You might remember that this was a Game Boy Advance game that got released on the PlayStation

1471
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,960
2 in Japan as part of a Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix type thing that came out.

1472
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,440
It was like a bonus disc.

1473
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,560
And it kind of was forgotten about and never was released over here.

1474
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,660
Until now, apparently, Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, it is going to be coming to the

1475
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,200
US.

1476
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:31,260
There was a small mention of Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories at Square Enix's presentation.

1477
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:35,240
When they were asked if it was the same one that was Final Mix 2 in Japan, they did confirm

1478
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,240
it with a nod.

1479
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,240
There hasn't been an official announcement through Square, just this small mention.

1480
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,360
So I guess you should take it with a little bit of a grain of salt.

1481
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,480
But apparently, if you tie things together, back in July, Squeenix was hiring an English

1482
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,640
voice cast.

1483
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,200
So probably to go for this game.

1484
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:56,640
Although that could also be for Final Fantasy 13, but who knows?

1485
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,840
I would think, why not release this game here?

1486
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,240
I mean, certainly, there's an audience for it.

1487
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:07,080
But, you know, they usually don't pay attention to everybody, do they?

1488
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,080
Who knows?

1489
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,080
It is Squeenix.

1490
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,080
They have gotten a lot more friendly about the whole worldwide releases and all that

1491
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,080
fun stuff.

1492
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,320
Well, let's hope.

1493
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,320
Let's indeed hope.

1494
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,520
Well, let's hope that Dark Sakura has dug through the archives this week and picked

1495
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,100
an awesome Classic Game of the Week this week.

1496
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,560
Have you done so, Dark Sakura?

1497
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,920
I'd like to think that I have.

1498
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,080
All right, well, let's get to it.

1499
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:32,680
Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week, the way we end Part A every week here on our lovely

1500
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,560
program here at Orange Launch Radio.

1501
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,920
What should the kids be playing this week?

1502
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,160
The Classic Game of the Week came out on Super Nintendo.

1503
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:46,160
It is one of the Mario franchises, and it is Mario Paint.

1504
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,680
Awesome.

1505
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:54,640
Mario Paint uses the SNES mouse that came with it, and it basically is a little drawing

1506
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,320
program for the most part.

1507
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:02,240
I mean, it basically is like Microsoft Paint, but the...

1508
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:10,880
I don't really want to go too much into the more, you know, structured part of the game.

1509
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,960
Let's go into what's playing in the background.

1510
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,240
This is a little clip from F-Zero that somebody has put into the little music maker in Mario

1511
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,240
Paint.

1512
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:30,560
Well, right, it did actually have a music program in there, and you could actually save

1513
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,920
things onto...

1514
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,280
I do believe that you could actually tape them, but it was very weird.

1515
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,880
A lot of these are more, you know, these days are done through an emulator now.

1516
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:47,240
But there was, going back to the art side of it, you could actually make stamps, and

1517
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:52,200
it came with stamps in it too, and that was cool, but you had 30 different colors, 60

1518
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:59,960
different textures and patterns, 75 different stamps, 15 customizable stamps, battery backup,

1519
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:05,000
and special erasers like the fade erase, water erase, where the picture becomes a grayscale

1520
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
and vanishes.

1521
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,360
Timed erase, rain erase, split image erase, pixelated erase, blinds erase, rocket erase,

1522
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,360
and abrupt erase.

1523
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:27,240
I'm just imagining, but here in the background, we have Dragon Force.

1524
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,720
I think this cheated a little bit though, this is using one of those external Mario

1525
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,040
Paint emulator things, but yeah, same idea.

1526
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:38,160
I know, I included basically a lot of those just because I thought they were fun.

1527
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:44,760
But yeah, there were the mini games called, a fly swatting game called Coffee Break or

1528
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:52,200
Nat Attack, and you played as the glove hand, which as we all know was the boss in the Smash

1529
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,600
Brothers games, right?

1530
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,860
And it holds a fly swatter, and it has to swat things.

1531
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:01,920
I love Nat Attack.

1532
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:09,040
There was also a little mini game on the title screen, where you could click the letters

1533
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,400
to have a certain sequence of actions go on, and then you could change the music, I'd have

1534
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,640
Yoshi show up, and paint the background.

1535
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:24,200
And also, this is a game that has a particular, yeah I put Power Rangers on it too because

1536
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,800
it's funny.

1537
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:31,840
But have you ever heard of Totoka's song, Rob?

1538
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,840
No.

1539
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:39,080
Kazumi Totoka was the guy who did a lot of Nintendo music, and there's a song that is

1540
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:44,060
like basically his little nineteen note song that shows up in all the games he does stuff

1541
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:48,400
on his little easter egg, and it shows up, oh I have heard of that.

1542
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,400
I have heard of that, yes.

1543
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:54,320
But for anyone who doesn't know, on Animal Crossing, it actually was KK's song, in Animal

1544
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,320
Crossing.

1545
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:01,880
So, I just wanted, you know, it was actually the, when you click the letter O in Mario

1546
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,880
Paint, the song plays.

1547
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,960
And for anyone who doesn't know, it was actually, the first appearance of it was in a Game Boy

1548
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,960
game called X.

1549
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:15,600
It was only out in Japan, unless you happened to either import or use ROMs.

1550
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:27,320
So Mario Paint is, another, has another pop culture, oh yeah.

1551
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:33,440
This is the song, Air Man, Taos and I, I think, yeah.

1552
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,320
I don't want to point out, this one is done in a legitimate Mario Paint.

1553
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,320
Yeah, that one was.

1554
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,920
And I thought it was very well done.

1555
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:47,560
But anyway, the first episode of Homestar Runner was animated in Mario Paint.

1556
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,360
That's so awesome.

1557
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,040
There have been sequels.

1558
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:57,760
There was one on the Nintendo 64 double D called Mario Artist, which was a launch title,

1559
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,560
and it brought out the mouse for the Nintendo 64, and it was to make 3D polygonal models,

1560
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:11,280
and you could actually insert images onto these 3D models using the Nintendo 64 capture

1561
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:16,160
cartridge and then show everyone, show your work with the communication kit online.

1562
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:21,040
Although we didn't, of course, get that over here, but Mario Paint did have a sort of appearance

1563
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,720
in WarioWare Touched as Wario Paint.

1564
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,720
Nice.

1565
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,960
And you had the turntable and the toy room and all that.

1566
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:35,260
And the most fun game was in WarioWare Mega Microgames, and Wii Photo Channel has an editing

1567
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,840
system that's similar to Mario Paint.

1568
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,320
And then, like we were mentioning before, there have been stand-alone applications of

1569
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,320
the music program.

1570
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:48,320
And I had to put that one on there.

1571
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:54,240
You've been paint-rolled, lol.

1572
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,320
So the game is Wario Paint.

1573
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,880
It is your classic game of the week.

1574
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:04,720
Mario Paint, available on the Super Nintendo, with yet another one of Nintendo's famous

1575
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,720
peripherals, the mouse.

1576
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:07,720
And the mouse...

1577
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,720
It was only on one game.

1578
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,720
No, no, it was one other.

1579
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,720
I want to say there was one other game that you could use it with.

1580
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,880
I think you could also use it on the gun games.

1581
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,880
I don't remember.

1582
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,400
I want to say, couldn't you use it on Lemmings you could use it on?

1583
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,400
Lemmings.

1584
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,400
Lemmings you could.

1585
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,400
Lemmings was one.

1586
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,400
In fact, I think I remember that actually being sort of a feature of it, wasn't it?

1587
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,400
I think so.

1588
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,520
I kind of irritated me, though.

1589
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,520
Anyway, that's it.

1590
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,520
There you go.

1591
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,520
Classic game of the week.

1592
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:35,080
All right, that's going to do it for part A of our show tonight, but stay tuned.

1593
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,080
There's plenty more to come.

1594
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,440
We're only halfway there.

1595
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,640
In part B tonight, your phone calls and more news, including some updates on Mortal Kombat

1596
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:47,760
versus DC Universe, Batman Arkham Asylum, and some news about Capcom, and some more

1597
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,960
Xbox bundles coming soon.

1598
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,320
So we're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back in just a little bit with more

1599
01:16:53,320 --> 01:17:01,800
of Orange Lounge Radio.

1600
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,120
So you've got a bunch of websites and podcasts about anime, manga, or video games, but you

1601
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,360
just don't have the time to read and listen to them all.

1602
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:15,740
When are you actually going to find the time to play games or watch anime?

1603
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:17,400
That's why there's Antigamers.

Not only are we a comprehensive anime, manga, and video game blog with news and reviews,

The Antigamers podcast, because we all need another anime and gaming podcast, right?

1613
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,000
Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here.

1614
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,040
Recently I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on Xbox Live.

1615
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,160
You always can't suck my fucking dick.

1616
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,640
I just got a dick in your ass.

1617
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,560
Do you like that dick in your butt, Ken?

1618
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,560
Where's Barbie?

1619
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,560
Yeah, where's Barbie?

1620
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,560
Is that Urkel?

1621
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,560
Urkel's your Barbie, huh?

1622
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,560
Is she in Malibu or no?

1623
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,920
Please, stop spewing hate speech on Xbox Live.

1624
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,680
It doesn't make you look cool, it won't get you any friends, and at the end of the day,

1625
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,960
you still have an incredibly small penis.

1626
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:53,920
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1627
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,440
That's a little old school bumper bringing us back there.

1628
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,760
That is like a million different people yelling out acronyms, I still don't know what they

1629
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,760
mean to this day.

1630
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,800
That was Megumi doing GGPO.

1631
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,800
What does that even mean?

1632
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,800
Good game, peace out.

1633
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,800
Oh, okay.

1634
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,800
Oh, nice.

1635
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,800
All right.

1636
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,800
There you go.

1637
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:13,000
All right, so yeah, those are our friends in Step Squad.

1638
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,200
Is there still a Step Squad that plays DDR?

1639
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:20,560
I'm sure Step Squad is still around, although honestly, the last time I saw Jahi, every

1640
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:26,400
time I ever see him is like randomly in Japantown, like when I'm not even trying, and I ran into

1641
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:32,080
Wendell at Fonome last year, and I've seen him a few times recently, and once at Yowie

1642
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,080
Con.

1643
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,080
Nice.

1644
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,080
Very nice.

1645
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,520
I think he was working security or something.

1646
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,840
All right.

1647
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,840
Very cool.

1648
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:45,120
VXJ6V is in chat and says, I asked that four years ago when I was on the show, and I guess

1649
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,840
I forgot what GGPO means.

1650
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,840
My bad.

1651
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,840
Nice.

1652
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,840
What, Logie?

1653
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,080
Before we started the second half here, I wanted to mention something I mentioned to

1654
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:57,160
you yesterday.

1655
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:08,000
We all got 14 day trials to World of Warcraft from PAX, and my wife wants to try Warcraft.

1656
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,840
Oh my god.

1657
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,680
The rapture is coming.

1658
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,680
Start praying.

1659
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,680
Wow.

1660
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,680
Is she really going to do it?

1661
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,680
I think she is.

1662
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,680
Actually, go ahead.

1663
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,520
I was going to say, she hates games, but she's going to start playing WoW.

1664
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,800
Well, she's going to try the 14 day trial.

1665
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,800
Wow.

1666
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,800
Amazing.

1667
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,280
We also, I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun a little bit for emails.

1668
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:31,280
Sure.

1669
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,280
Sure.

1670
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,280
We got one from Sakura Max.

1671
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,280
This is from my cell phone.

1672
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,280
I survived the hurricane.

1673
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,280
No electricity.

1674
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,280
Minimal damage to my house.

1675
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,280
Thank you.

1676
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,280
Ah, yes.

1677
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,280
Thank you for reminding.

1678
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:45,120
There was that horrible hurricane that happened, and we hope any listener who is potentially

1679
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,540
impacted by that is doing okay.

1680
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:52,440
From what I hear, it's a lot of really, really bad damage, but I don't know.

1681
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,920
I hope I don't make an ass out of myself, but last time I checked, it didn't sound like

1682
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,920
the fatalities were nearly as bad as the last time we had a major hurricane in this country,

1683
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,520
so I guess that's progress.

1684
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,900
It's still very unfortunate, but I hope all of our listeners are a-okay.

1685
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:10,080
It sounds like most people got out of there in time, so hopefully people packed their

1686
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,840
stuff up and got out of there, and remember, stuff is stuff.

1687
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,360
Stuff is just stuff.

1688
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,360
Yep.

1689
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,520
So, best of luck to all those folks.

1690
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:22,240
And it's still moving through other parts of the country, through the Midwest, and so

1691
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,240
on, so we hope everybody's doing okay.

1692
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,040
But now it's just a tropical depression or whatever.

1693
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,440
And to respond to Chat Room, I'm not necessarily encouraging her to play.

1694
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:36,800
That's something she wants to try, because everyone keeps talking about it.

1695
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,040
She feels left out.

1696
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:43,040
Personally, I don't know if I would start playing, because I don't know if I'd want

1697
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,040
to.

1698
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:48,240
Sharon in Chat has a very strong opinion, if Loki wants to help Nellie with World of

1699
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:53,080
Warcraft, he should just get her a real RPG instead, oo-burn.

1700
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,480
She doesn't have the patience for that stuff.

1701
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:59,280
For the record, I actually, um, I'm not going back in the Chat Room because I keep getting

1702
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,280
dropped.

1703
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,280
Doh.

1704
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,960
Yeah, we're having some network problems here in studio.

1705
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,960
It's annoying!

1706
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,760
Just another night here at OLR, so I guess maybe somebody will be buying me a new router

1707
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:10,760
soon.

1708
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,760
I don't know.

1709
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,080
Moving on, we're going to get into some gaming news tonight, here at Orange Launch Radio,

1710
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,320
some more.

1711
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,480
We haven't even talked at all, really, about Xbox 360 news, and I think that's where we're

1712
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,160
going to start tonight, right, Loki?

1713
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,160
Yep.

1714
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:28,800
There was, of course, some rumors coming out of PAX about a possible new Halo game coming

1715
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,500
out, and then people realized, oh, it's just the map pack, and there was new achievements

1716
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,320
that got leaked out, and all that fun stuff.

1717
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:39,140
Well, those new achievements have been confirmed as actual achievements that will be coming

1718
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:48,840
to Halo 3, and they're coming to Halo 3 later this month, so you can expect for, I guess,

1719
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,280
I don't know how many new points they're going to add to it, but a whole bunch of new achievements.

1720
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,160
I guess they come out with a new map pack, so that'd be kind of neat.

1721
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,640
And it's part of their title update, too.

1722
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,860
Well, hooray for them doing a big update.

1723
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:03,860
It's going to be free?

1724
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:04,860
Yes.

1725
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:05,860
We hope.

1726
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:06,860
Awesome.

1727
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:07,860
The update will be free.

1728
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:10,520
It's going to be free, but map pack, probably not.

1729
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:15,400
But remember, and not to discourage people buying it, but remember all those other map

1730
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,400
packs that they had out there?

1731
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,920
Well, those eventually become free anyway, so...

1732
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,920
Dope.

1733
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,920
Yeah, it's a rental.

1734
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:22,920
Alright.

1735
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:28,840
Well, hey, if Halo 3 is not your cup of tea, maybe you're more of a fighting game fan,

1736
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,960
and you're looking forward to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, which we talked about last

1737
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:36,100
week here on the show post PAX, because they had a playable on the show floor at PAX, and

1738
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:40,080
it was big, dumb fun, is what it was, I would call it.

1739
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:45,840
Well, unfortunately, some of the big, dumb fun has been ruined this week, thanks to a

1740
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,480
leaked list of achievements.

1741
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,560
Xbox360achievements.org, hey, you know what, they were just doing their job, that's what

1742
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,040
they do, they uncover achievements as soon as they find out about them.

1743
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:00,000
Well, it turns out the achievement list spoils the entire character roster from Mortal Kombat

1744
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
vs. DC Universe.

1745
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Yay!

1746
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,440
So now we know who's in the game.

1747
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,400
And you know, Midway kind of danced around this, obviously, you know someone was pissed,

1748
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:11,580
you know somebody's heads was rolling after this, they initially said, we have not officially

1749
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:16,520
released it, and then they came back and said, yeah, okay, it's true, dongle between our

1750
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,560
legs, run away, yipe yipe yipe.

1751
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:25,400
Alright, so here's the characters from Mortal Kombat, Baraka, Jax, Kano, Katana, Liu Kang,

1752
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:30,840
Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, Sonya, and Sub-Zero.

1753
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,760
So a pretty good list, that's pretty much the Mortal Kombat 2 roster without Mileena

1754
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,760
and...

1755
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:40,480
Well, they said, they also said that that might not be everybody.

1756
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,900
True, they could always do download characters and so on, right?

1757
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,920
Or there's characters that just don't have achievements.

1758
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,920
Right, right.

1759
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,880
And there's one other character missing too, god, why can't I remember his name, the guy

1760
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,120
with the hat that cut people down the middle.

1761
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,120
Oh, Kung Lao.

1762
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,520
Kung Lao, he's not in there either.

1763
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,920
DC Universe.

1764
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,920
And no reptile either.

1765
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,320
Alright, DC Universe, this is the stuff people really, really care about, I'm sure, the comic

1766
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,320
book characters.

1767
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,320
Here's who's coming from DC Universe.

1768
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,320
Batman, what's that?

1769
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,800
Nothing, I'm just, it's a pet peeve, that's okay, keep going.

1770
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:12,800
Oh, okay.

1771
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,800
DC Universe has...

1772
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,800
I'll say it when you say his name.

1773
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:20,360
Batman, Catwoman, Dark Seed, Deathstroke, I think it's Dark Side.

1774
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:27,720
Dark Side, Flash, sorry, you know what a comic book fan I am, Flash, Green Lantern, The Joker,

1775
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:31,600
Lex Luthor, Shazam, Superman, and Wonder Woman.

1776
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:37,160
You know, it's funny, every time I hear Shazam, I think Kazaam, and I'm like...

1777
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,640
It's Captain Marvel.

1778
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,640
Okay.

1779
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,920
Wait, why did they...

1780
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,640
Because that's what all of his books were called.

1781
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,960
Oh, okay.

1782
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:46,960
I see.

1783
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,360
Well, but that's what they're going to refer to him as in the game, probably, I guess,

1784
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:53,820
because if they're pulling this off the achievement list, they must be referring to him as that

1785
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:57,400
in the game, so, interesting.

1786
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,400
There you go.

1787
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:03,320
Well, I'm excited, now we can finally throw down Wonder Woman vs. Catwoman, that'll be

1788
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,320
awesome.

1789
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,960
Looking forward to that.

1790
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:11,440
Oh, this game comes out soon, be on the lookout for it, it'll be out before the holidays.

1791
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,440
And there you go.

1792
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,440
I don't know.

1793
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,680
November 19th, if I remember correctly.

1794
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,680
Is that it?

1795
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,680
All right.

1796
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,680
Just in time for Thanksgiving.

1797
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,360
I just wish they'd have other unlockable characters later on, that would be neat.

1798
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,160
They may, and they may have pay-to-unlock characters, who knows.

1799
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:27,880
You know, this is the first Mortal Kombat on the next-gen system, am I right?

1800
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:28,880
Yeah.

1801
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,800
Yeah, so who knows, they might have the downloadable characters, that'd be kind of cool.

1802
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:39,040
Well speaking of stuff related to the DC Universe, this personally makes me giddy.

1803
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:43,200
I mean, crazy loony giddy.

1804
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:48,000
For the game Batman Arkham Asylum, they are getting Mark Hamill to play Joker.

1805
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,280
And that makes me happy, because as far as anyone who has ever voiced the Joker, Mark

1806
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,520
Hamill is the one.

1807
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,520
I'm sorry.

1808
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,520
When I think Joker, I think, you know, when I'm not thinking of the comic books, I'm thinking

1809
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,080
of animated series Joker, just because he's so goofball, I think is cool.

1810
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,480
You don't think about the movies, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, or any of that?

1811
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,000
I have not seen Dark Knight, remember?

1812
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Oh wow, all right.

1813
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,440
I'm going to see it in IMAX.

1814
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,000
It was pretty impressive, I gotta say.

1815
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,320
I'm going to see it in IMAX.

1816
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,320
It's here, inside.

1817
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,320
I know.

1818
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,320
You gotta go see it.

1819
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,320
When I go see it, it will be in IMAX.

1820
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,320
All right.

1821
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,320
Have fun.

1822
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:22,360
But this makes me very, very, very, very giddy.

1823
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:27,480
JackDeffDegrees in chatroom, chat.orangelandtrader.com, says, Mark Hamill is the Joker.

1824
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,040
And Solid Goomba simply says, fuck yeah, Mark Hamill.

1825
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,920
What is it about Mark Hamill that makes him so fucking amazing?

1826
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:35,560
He does the best Joker, I'm sorry.

1827
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:41,320
Then he was, what was it in Jay and Silent Bob Cockknocker?

1828
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,280
Yes, he was also in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.

1829
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,560
But there's more news.

1830
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,480
You could appear in the game.

1831
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,480
Really?

1832
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,480
Me?

1833
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,480
There could be Rob in the game.

1834
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,480
Little old me?

1835
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,480
Little old me?

1836
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:58,760
There is a contest right now from GI that will allow the winner to become an Arkham

1837
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:00,000
inmate.

1838
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,280
And you get your cell decked out with personal photos and wall scribbles.

1839
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,160
That's more of a Loki role, don't you think?

1840
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,760
I would be all over that.

1841
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:12,840
And all of my graffiti would be, hello, hi, mom, I'm in jail.

1842
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,840
I like it here.

1843
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:14,840
It's nice.

1844
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:19,560
I think, and I don't know if Travis still does this on Understandation Live, but maybe

1845
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,000
my voice could be something like, I've been here for seven years.

1846
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,440
The medication doesn't work.

1847
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,340
Does he still do that on Understandation Live?

1848
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,340
I don't even know.

1849
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:29,340
That sounds weird.

1850
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:36,360
Somebody, no, there was this old sound bite he used to play like all the freaking time

1851
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:39,880
of this guy going, I've been here for seven years.

1852
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:40,980
Forget it.

1853
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:41,980
We should all audition.

1854
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,900
Don't you want to be in a game as a crazy person?

1855
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,900
Come on, Loki.

1856
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,900
Admit it.

1857
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:49,000
As long as I'm in a game as a crazy person.

1858
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,480
There you go.

1859
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,640
DJ Dark Knight says, I can't see Jamie being in jail.

1860
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,400
Oh, how little you know, Jamie.

1861
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,040
I've been in jail before.

1862
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,040
Really?

1863
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,040
Hi, dad.

1864
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,040
I'm in jail.

1865
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,040
Are we talking about like Sadie Hawkins dance jail?

1866
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,040
No.

1867
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,040
Really?

1868
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,040
You went to the big house?

1869
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,040
No, I went to the little house.

1870
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,040
I ran away from home once.

1871
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,040
Oh, okay.

1872
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,040
Oh, awesome.

1873
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,040
I never knew that.

1874
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,040
Yep.

1875
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,040
I ran away from home once.

1876
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,040
Okay.

1877
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,040
Hi, dad.

1878
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,200
Did you have to make that phone call?

1879
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,200
No, I'm in jail.

1880
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,200
I like it here.

1881
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,200
No.

1882
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,200
There's like, just go sleep or read the Bible.

1883
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,200
Alabama.

1884
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,200
They make you either sleep or read the Bible.

1885
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,600
Huh.

1886
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,080
And then my mom came and got me.

1887
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,080
So yeah.

1888
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,080
Wow.

1889
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,080
I never knew that.

1890
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,080
Interesting.

1891
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,080
Huh.

1892
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:37,680
Six years and I never knew that Jamie was in jail.

1893
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:39,960
There's quite a bit about me you don't know.

1894
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:40,960
Apparently.

1895
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,800
But now the internet knows.

1896
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,320
It wasn't real jail.

1897
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,320
Yeah, I know.

1898
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,320
It wasn't real jail.

1899
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,320
Okay.

1900
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,320
All right.

1901
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,320
Yes, Loki.

1902
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:56,800
So, of course, with the announcement of the price drop last week, the Xbox sales numbers

1903
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,760
are apparently doubling according to Microsoft and I guess we'll have to see when the MPT

1904
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,680
numbers come out at the beginning of October.

1905
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,640
But that's pretty promising.

1906
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:12,840
I mean, not a big surprise that, I don't know, it's selling well when it's cheaper.

1907
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:16,120
I mean, that's, I guess, a shocker to a lot of people.

1908
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,800
No, wait, no it's not.

1909
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,800
Is it Christmas yet?

1910
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,800
Huh.

1911
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,240
Well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens with this.

1912
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,240
That's why I'm curious.

1913
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,960
Is this a trend that's going to continue through Christmas?

1914
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,960
I don't know.

1915
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:26,960
All right.

1916
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,840
Xbox 360 is now going to sell because everybody got a Wii last Christmas.

1917
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:30,840
I don't know.

1918
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:31,840
Who knows?

1919
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:38,360
I still hear and it really irks me, not that I'm picking sides or anything, but...

1920
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,360
But you are.

1921
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,360
I'm not.

1922
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,720
Yeah, really I'm not.

1923
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:45,580
But when Sony comes out and like says, oh yeah, we're winning.

1924
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:48,720
How are you winning when you have a quarter of the like market?

1925
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,720
ABBA.

1926
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,720
What?

1927
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,720
ABBA.

1928
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,720
No, no.

1929
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,880
Listen, ABBA ain't going to do shit, okay?

1930
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:56,880
Tell that to Rob.

1931
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,880
Bite your tongue.

1932
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:58,880
Tell that to Rob.

1933
01:30:58,880 --> 01:30:59,880
ABBA ain't going to do shit.

1934
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:00,880
That's what I'm saying.

1935
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,880
No one buys SingStar.

1936
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,880
Okay?

1937
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:03,880
Nobody.

1938
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:04,880
Unless you're in Europe.

1939
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:05,880
I hate you.

1940
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:06,880
I don't know you anymore.

1941
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,880
I disown you as a friend.

1942
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:08,880
And you know what?

1943
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,880
I thought Mamma Mia sucked.

1944
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,880
No.

1945
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,880
Get out of my house!

1946
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:21,800
It just irks me when they say that they're winning, but it's like, dude, listen, you're

1947
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,160
not even close to winning.

1948
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:29,960
I mean, if you were like, you know, the Wii back in June when you were like 10,000 units

1949
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:33,860
away from, you know, becoming number one, yeah, that's close to winning.

1950
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:37,880
When you're millions of units behind, that's not close to winning, okay?

1951
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,420
So don't talk that you're, you're going to do it.

1952
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:41,760
You're going to do it by like year's end.

1953
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,760
Or you're not.

1954
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,440
You're not going to do it by year's end 2011, okay?

1955
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,760
So stop it.

1956
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:47,760
Seriously.

1957
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,280
So are you saying that SingStar Abba's not going to sell well?

1958
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:57,560
Would you care to make a little wager on SingStar Abba selling well or not?

1959
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:00,080
No, I'm not.

1960
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,200
What doesn't have to be Tingle?

1961
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,960
I can think of far better punishments.

1962
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,960
No, it's not.

1963
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:05,960
Damn.

1964
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,000
Everybody make chicken noises at Loki.

1965
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,240
I'll think about it, but I'm pretty sure it's not.

1966
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,520
Oh, he said, I think about it.

1967
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,520
I got to do my research.

1968
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,520
All right.

1969
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,520
Rob, I will totally play SingStar with you.

1970
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,520
I know.

1971
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,960
You're getting the Abba one, right?

1972
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:26,560
The chat room is, the chat room is demanding it on Justin TV when it comes out.

1973
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,400
So we'll see.

1974
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,280
We'll see.

1975
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:34,000
Moving on.

1976
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,720
We'll see how the Xbox 360 sells after the price drop and moving on into Christmas.

1977
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:41,280
I think they're going to continue to sell pretty well.

1978
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:44,760
The question is, will they overtake Nintendo or will Sony answer them?

1979
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,760
That's another one.

1980
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,720
A lot of people seem doubtful, but who knows?

1981
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,120
Another game that a lot of folks have been playing on their Xbox 360s as well as their

1982
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,000
PlayStation 3 is Burnout Paradise.

1983
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,760
And a long awaited motorcycle download is coming on September 18th.

1984
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,760
It's actually a new patch, basically.

1985
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,880
It's a free download update, 38 new clock race events.

1986
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:15,520
Dynamic weather events, a day-night cycle, meaning the game goes up from day to night,

1987
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:20,600
70 new challenges in the Freeburns thing, and motorcycles.

1988
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,600
So that's pretty cool.

1989
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,760
But when are they adding the airplanes?

1990
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,200
That's what I want to know, because they're talking about adding airplanes.

1991
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,200
I'm glad to be...

1992
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,200
Who's got giant enemy crabs?

1993
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,200
Yes.

1994
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:33,040
I want to be able to drive a giant enemy crab.

1995
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,380
This is one of those games that I played for three days and I never played again.

1996
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:39,360
And I keep thinking I need to go back and play it again.

1997
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,520
This is giving me the incentive to do so, so I'm definitely going to have to check it

1998
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,520
out.

1999
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,520
Sounds pretty cool.

2000
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,720
Have you been playing any Burnout Paradise, Loki, or has this kind of put it away?

2001
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:51,320
No, I just noticed the other day that I still have my copy of Burnout Paradise sitting on

2002
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,820
a shelf.

2003
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:55,920
It just came out at a bad time, from what I remember.

2004
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,960
I need to go back and look at it again.

2005
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:02,280
It was better than the last one, but I don't know.

2006
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:06,600
It's just, when the next big game came out, I forgot about it.

2007
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:12,440
And sadly enough, you know, with Rock Band 2 and stuff, when Saints Row 2 comes out,

2008
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:15,160
I'm going to forget about Rock Band 2.

2009
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,160
Never.

2010
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,400
I'll never forget about Rock Band 2.

2011
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,960
Hey, they're doing a pretty good job trying to extend the life of it with the challenges

2012
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:20,960
and everything.

2013
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,000
But anyway, let's move on.

2014
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Moving on.

2015
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Yes, please.

2016
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,760
Well, you know one of my favorite ever companies is Capcom, right?

2017
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,760
Yep.

2018
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,760
Yeah.

2019
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:33,760
They were nice to me.

2020
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,280
I don't know why they were mean to you.

2021
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,680
Do we have to go back there again?

2022
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:39,680
Because don't get me started, do not go there.

2023
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:45,800
Well, Capcom is planning on doing all of their major titles on multiple platforms to maximize

2024
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:51,400
their impact in the United States, especially, just outside of Japan.

2025
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:56,880
And it's actually quoted as saying basically where the consuls are practically waging war

2026
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:01,000
on one another in their annual report.

2027
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,400
It said, completing implementation of multi-platform development on major titles means that all

2028
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:11,040
major titles launched during the next fiscal year or thereafter will be developed as multi-platform

2029
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,040
games.

2030
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:19,400
So, that's why we should be, you know, that's why Devil May Cry 4, for example.

2031
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,400
Or Mega Man 9.

2032
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,400
Mega Man 9, exactly.

2033
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:26,600
A lot of us assumed it was going to be WiiWare only and then suddenly it's showing up everywhere.

2034
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:35,520
The MT framework is actually supposed to be for PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 development.

2035
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:40,280
Resident Evil 5, Street Fighter IV are among the list.

2036
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:46,200
And so they're also thinking about including a few more casual games like for Wii and other

2037
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,880
more casual game systems.

2038
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:52,040
You know it would be interesting if they released Mega Man 9 on PC as well.

2039
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,440
Why not, huh?

2040
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:57,840
You know there was an old, old, old Mega Man game on the PC that I owned, and it wasn't

2041
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,440
related to any of the other Mega Mans.

2042
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:02,800
I remember it only had three boss monsters, which I thought was kind of cheesy.

2043
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,040
Are you talking about Man of the Power Battles?

2044
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:11,240
No, it was an actual, it was a side scroller like in the vein of the Nintendo games, but

2045
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,480
with better graphics at the time because it was on PC.

2046
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,960
I don't know, maybe somebody in the chat room knows more about this and can remember.

2047
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,380
I actually bought this game like way back when in the early 90s, and it had like three

2048
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,160
boss monsters, so it was short.

2049
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:25,400
But I remember like one of them was electricity based, as you remember.

2050
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:29,600
It wasn't, it wasn't based on, they were new Mega Man monsters.

2051
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,440
It was like a completely different Mega Man game.

2052
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,440
I'm not crazy.

2053
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:41,760
Well, in other news, they also are, they stated also again in their annual report Capcom did

2054
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:47,360
that there are more Western focused titles in development, one of them named Dark Void,

2055
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,760
if you know, we remember that.

2056
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:56,320
And they plan to aggressively acquire partners and other studios, especially independent

2057
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:00,580
developers, the ones that will share their vision.

2058
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:10,520
So I think that that's sounding to me very, like a potential good thing.

2059
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,720
I found the information on Wikipedia.

2060
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:13,720
Did you now?

2061
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:14,720
Yes.

2062
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:15,720
It was by High Tech Expressions.

2063
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,520
It was released in 1990.

2064
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,440
It was just licensed by Capcom.

2065
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,980
There were three robot masters, Volt Man, Sonic Man, and Dynaman, and there were only

2066
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:26,920
two levels in the Wily Fortress, so it was a short game.

2067
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,360
Yeah, I'd say.

2068
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:31,240
And there were other versions on PC, I guess, too.

2069
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,240
I never knew about those.

2070
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,240
I just had the first one.

2071
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:37,040
I don't think the PC versions were very good.

2072
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,720
They were cool when I was a kid, but I don't think they're cool now.

2073
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,720
What?

2074
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:41,720
Thanks to you.

2075
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:42,720
Huh?

2076
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:46,480
The Air Man Can't Be Defeated song.

2077
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,920
Whose fault is that?

2078
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,920
Yours.

2079
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:49,920
No.

2080
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:57,400
Well, some things that are good come in threes, I guess, including a bundle that's being released

2081
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:01,560
by Microsoft coming out later this holiday.

2082
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:09,260
It's a brand new 12 month live gold kit, and it's gonna come with Project Gotham Racing

2083
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:18,320
4, a 12 plus one month card of live, and the Xbox 360 messenger kit, and it's gonna run

2084
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,480
you $69.99.

2085
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:25,840
This was rumored to be coming out from the GameStop expo, although it's on their website

2086
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,920
now, and I personally know it's coming out, so it is coming out.

2087
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,980
It's kind of a good deal.

2088
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:36,320
There was some other bundle that they were talking about coming out as well that I haven't

2089
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,640
heard anything on, but I know this one for sure is coming out, so.

2090
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:40,640
Alright.

2091
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,120
It's pretty cool.

2092
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,960
Very cool, and especially when they're trying to move more consoles and units.

2093
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,160
If I remember correctly, I think this is coming out in a few weeks, too, so.

2094
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,160
Nice.

2095
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,160
Yeah.

2096
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:53,960
Well, there is some drama going on in the Microsoft world, and it has to do with a firing

2097
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,360
that happened this week.

2098
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:59,120
Apparently what happened, there was this guy who actually went on the record.

2099
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:04,800
He went on this website, VentureBeat, and actually talked openly about the red rings

2100
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,800
of death.

2101
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,160
The guy's name was Robert Delaware.

2102
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:11,480
He was a Microsoft game tester, but he was through a temp agency called Excel Data.

2103
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:14,520
He was let go by the company on Wednesday.

2104
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,440
They are now threatening to sue.

2105
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,880
They're threatening civil charges to this guy, because apparently what he did, he went

2106
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:25,000
on to VentureBeat and talked about, openly, with his name and everything, and the website

2107
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,720
kind of told him what the consequences might be of him using his real name, and he was

2108
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:30,280
like, so what?

2109
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,820
Apparently he went on and talked about these two different red ring to death scenarios.

2110
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:38,760
A reproducible crash that could happen in NBA 2K6 was one game that you could reproduce

2111
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:44,800
the crash in, and apparently some dashboard update bugs in Dead Rising.

2112
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,740
Apparently he's being very standoffish about it.

2113
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:52,240
He doesn't care that the former employer of his wants to sue him and says, if they want

2114
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:55,720
to come after me, bring it on.

2115
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:56,720
Very interesting.

2116
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:01,200
But, you know, he did probably violate the terms of employment that he had with Microsoft

2117
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,920
and all these companies that he was working through.

2118
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:07,520
I mean, you do kind of don't talk about the products like this, especially on a website.

2119
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,700
It's a little...

2120
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:15,760
I hope he knows what he's talking about, because he's gonna have to prove, well, yeah, I guess

2121
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,480
he's gonna have to prove that he's telling the truth, so.

2122
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,840
D'Artesuja says, wow, the cajones on this guy, yeah, for real.

2123
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:25,040
Rama says, did he sign an NDA that forbade him from saying this?

2124
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,040
I'm sure he must have.

2125
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,200
If he didn't sign the NDA.

2126
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:31,720
Unless it was specific, or, I don't know.

2127
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:35,760
Maybe, but even still, though, I mean, they can get him on that, but at the same time,

2128
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,640
I mean, he's hoping to open like a whole other can of worms with, you know, Microsoft knew

2129
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,960
about these defects and they didn't do anything about it.

2130
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:43,960
Ah, I see.

2131
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:44,960
So he's trying to be a hero, basically.

2132
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:45,960
Yeah.

2133
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,960
Well, we know what happens to heroes.

2134
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:48,960
Yes.

2135
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:49,960
They become martyrs.

2136
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:55,600
Well, let's hope it doesn't get that bad, but, well, there you go.

2137
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:59,080
We'll keep you updated if we hear anything else in the adventures of this guy and his

2138
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,280
soon-to-be legal troubles.

2139
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:04,400
Well, something that might not be soon to happen, I mean, they're talking about it,

2140
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:12,080
but I'm still thinking that it'll be out when another title with its name comes out, is

2141
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:16,120
there are supposed to be a Duke Nukem movie.

2142
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:17,360
Yeah.

2143
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:22,560
Scott Fay, the one who's doing Max Payne, was saying that he's working on a movie scenario

2144
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:32,500
that he thinks will do the character in the series justice, but I'm honestly really expecting

2145
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:40,960
to see it more along the lines of when Duke Nukem Forever comes out, maybe, but he also

2146
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:49,320
says that Depth Entertainment will be doing with trying to work on a few other cross media

2147
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:58,160
franchises going into games and film, and they actually are still at work at doing American

2148
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:03,840
McGee's Alice, and Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't doing that anymore, by the way.

2149
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,400
Oh, really?

2150
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:06,640
Yeah.

2151
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:11,440
You know she changed her last name officially for her husband?

2152
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,000
That's one of those Hollywood relationships that has actually stayed together, so good

2153
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
for them.

2154
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,320
As a anniversary present, I thought that was really sweet.

2155
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,320
Mm-hmm.

2156
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:23,280
Well, if you want to hear something even more ridiculous, there was a rumor coming around

2157
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:30,000
about a Craigslist entry that said that they were casting for a Rock Band 2 TV show.

2158
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:36,240
Well, apparently it is true, and it's going to be officially launched next week, Rock

2159
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:44,800
Band 2 The Show, and they also have some other stuff they're going to be showing as well.

2160
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:48,340
I know they did something last night during the launch party.

2161
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:54,000
They had Alice Cooper and Sebastian Bach facing off and stuff, but apparently there is some

2162
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,440
sort of Rock Band show that's going to happen on MTV.

2163
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,440
And what exactly will be on the Rock Band show?

2164
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,440
It's basically...

2165
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,000
Just watching people play Rock Band?

2166
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,720
Basically you're going to follow, I guess they're going to set up some band teams or

2167
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:10,720
whatever.

2168
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,560
It's a 30-minute commercial for the game is what it is.

2169
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,560
Basically, yeah.

2170
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:17,680
Well, when you're MTV and you put out the game, you can kind of do that, so...

2171
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,760
Besides, you know what?

2172
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:22,680
I don't see this being much worse than some of the other programming on that station,

2173
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,680
so bring it on.

2174
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:24,920
True, I guess it'll be better than The Hills.

2175
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:25,920
So there you go.

2176
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,480
Well, you know, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear about one of my favorite music

2177
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:34,840
games jumping the shark and becoming a half-hour commercial TV series and reminding us why

2178
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:40,320
MTV is a little bit poison for this series, or a lot of it poison, I get very angsty.

2179
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:43,840
I don't know about you guys, but it makes me just want to get out the angst in a segment

2180
01:43:43,840 --> 01:44:01,360
we call the FUs of the Week.

2181
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:06,400
My FU goes to bullshit in the mouths it spews from.

2182
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,400
Loki.

2183
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:11,880
My FU goes to EA for saying that the Rock Band 2 drums are supposed to be out today

2184
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:18,360
and not actually shipping the Rock Band 2 drums to anybody, so it's a big clusterfuck.

2185
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,060
Thank you.

2186
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:27,040
My FU goes to whatever little animal decided to crawl under our house and die because it

2187
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:30,960
happened on, I guess, Friday when we started noticing that, hmm, something smells like

2188
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,360
death.

2189
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,740
So now the animal control people aren't going to be able to even come out until Monday because

2190
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:40,360
we think it's a cat, because there was a cat that was sometimes in our backyard that just

2191
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:44,440
looked like hell, and it's not around anymore.

2192
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:50,420
So you know, although I am sad for little kitty, FU to deciding to die under our house

2193
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:53,040
and not in, say, the neighbor's pool.

2194
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:57,520
Come on.

2195
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,520
It's just gross.

2196
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,520
All right.

2197
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:03,120
That's it for the FUs of the Week.

2198
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:07,160
But boy, we get into some FUs of the century when we talk about some of the gaming industry's

2199
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,660
biggest controversies they've ever had.

2200
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:12,440
This is on a website called MCVUK.com.

2201
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,320
They ran a top 10 list this week of gaming's biggest controversies.

2202
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:19,640
Hey, if you want to get your website on Dig, just add a top 10 list.

2203
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,640
Seriously.

2204
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,840
That's all you ever see on Dig are these top 10 lists from these sites I'd never heard

2205
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:25,520
of until I see the top 10 list.

2206
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,360
So there you go.

2207
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,640
Anyhow, here's a quick rundown of what the controversies are.

2208
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:33,640
Number one on the list, the Night Trap.

2209
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:37,560
Remember Night Trap when that was out on Sega CD, and it actually had video?

2210
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,560
With Dana Plato.

2211
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,560
Exactly.

2212
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:43,080
Dana Plato was fucked up.

2213
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:46,880
And it was just girls running around basically in their undies, getting eaten by monsters.

2214
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:47,880
It was pretty violent.

2215
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:53,280
It was real, because it was like real video and all that stuff.

2216
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:58,240
Gaming's biggest controversies, number two, Mortal Kombat, because it kind of, if you

2217
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:00,520
think about it, started the ESRB.

2218
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:04,160
Remember when you'd see all those fatalities on the nightly news and everything about,

2219
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,720
oh my god, so much blood, rivers of gore, rivers of gore.

2220
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:10,280
You know, and then they're just, it's on the nightly news.

2221
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,960
It started the ESRB, essentially.

2222
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:14,560
So it was highly controversial.

2223
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:17,400
Carmageddon is number three on the list.

2224
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,400
Carmageddon.

2225
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,400
Well, Carmageddon, you know, and it was a little bit more in Britain, because, you know,

2226
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:27,200
remember it went over to the BBFC, trying to get a certain rating, and then they actually

2227
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:32,520
banned the game and forced this company to remove all the gore from the film, or from

2228
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:37,520
the game, and so they substituted green blood instead of red blood, very similar to what

2229
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,160
happened with the sweat in Mortal Kombat here.

2230
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:42,000
They got green blood zombies.

2231
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:48,600
Well, you know, in Samurai Shodown, for the US one, they put in, well, I think it was

2232
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:51,560
the US one, they had sweat instead of blood, like in the Japanese one.

2233
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,280
Yeah, a little silly.

2234
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,120
And in the German one, they had robots.

2235
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:58,680
Not even people, but robots that you ran over.

2236
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:03,660
America's Army is number four, and it has to do with, you know, the game was developed

2237
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:06,560
and is being used as a recruitment tool.

2238
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:11,120
But Ubisoft kind of has gotten itself in a little bit of trouble for publishing the console

2239
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,200
version of the title.

2240
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:16,400
Apparently there was like a demonstration outside of their offices after this whole

2241
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:25,200
thing, because they actually went and published a console version, and that was really bad.

2242
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:30,500
It's basically a giant recruitment tool, which in a way is controversial in itself.

2243
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:35,120
Number five was something called Murder by PlayStation.

2244
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:40,800
Apparently it was some type of like story that was actually released, it was a headline

2245
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:45,120
that was actually in a paper on the Daily Mail, and it was actually a story about a

2246
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:50,800
14-year-old kid who was murdered by a 17-year-old kid, and the newspaper claimed that the kid

2247
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:57,080
was obsessed with Manhunt, and by the way, police did say there was absolutely no link

2248
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:59,240
between the game and the killing.

2249
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:05,040
But yet that headline, Murder by PlayStation, giant bold letters, still exists.

2250
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:09,360
Number six on the list, the guy game, remember the guy game, Loki?

2251
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,400
We covered the guy game on this program.

2252
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:16,480
Guy game was awesome, except for the 17-year-old that got in it, that caused the game to get

2253
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,120
pulled from shells everywhere.

2254
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:24,440
Dude, seriously, I mean, yeah, because tits on a 17-year-old really change a lot in a

2255
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:25,440
year.

2256
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,440
Seriously.

2257
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:27,440
It's gay.

2258
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:31,760
Well, I don't, actually no, it wouldn't be gay, unless you're a woman.

2259
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,880
No, because that game screws another of the same gender.

2260
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,600
It was just, I mean, obviously it's a big no-no, and very irresponsible.

2261
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,040
It's her fault anyway, she lied about her age.

2262
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:43,040
It's just irresponsible.

2263
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,040
Dumb bitch.

2264
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:47,400
But the game, the game itself- They could be having guy game four by now.

2265
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:51,640
Yeah, if you cut this little element out of the game, we'd be on like guy game, you know,

2266
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:53,920
on Xbox Live Arcade, it would be awesome.

2267
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,920
Hell yeah.

2268
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:00,520
Number seven, hot coffee, all I need to say.

2269
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:03,360
If you don't know enough about that by now, where have you been?

2270
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,400
Number eight was when the BBFC tackled Band Hunt 2.

2271
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,960
Of course, there was all the controversy around that, and then that got banned, and then it

2272
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:14,020
wasn't, and then the game sucked anyway, remember?

2273
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:18,880
Number nine was Goat Gate, which is another way to refer to, remember the Greek god launch

2274
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,400
party for God of War 2 over in Europe?

2275
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,160
And they actually slaughtered a live goat.

2276
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:25,800
Remember that?

2277
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:31,160
I don't think that- Marketing genius over there.

2278
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:35,000
Dot, dot, dot, that's all I have to say.

2279
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Dot, dot, dot.

2280
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,520
And then the other last controversy on the list, because I know you're all loving this.

2281
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,560
Sony versus God.

2282
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:48,400
And it has to do with the fact that the Church of England was actually used- Manchester Cathedral,

2283
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,200
its church was actually used in Resistance, Fall of Man, and they were not happy about

2284
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:53,200
that.

2285
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:54,200
Remember that?

2286
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,240
We covered that on the show a little while ago.

2287
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:57,240
So there you have it.

2288
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:01,840
The top 10 biggest controversies according to MCV UK, so it is a little more UK based,

2289
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,200
hence why we had a couple of those in there, but I would say UK or not, those are pretty

2290
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,680
good entries on the list.

2291
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,240
Very controversial.

2292
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:11,000
Anything you think they left off?

2293
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,960
I think, remember the PSP ad that had like the, it was almost racist because it had like

2294
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:19,960
the white and the black, and it was, oh man, it was bad.

2295
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:20,960
Remember that?

2296
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,720
That was somehow left off the list.

2297
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:26,320
Just another brilliant Sony marketing scheme from the day.

2298
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,320
Anything else you guys can think of?

2299
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:28,320
I don't know.

2300
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,320
I think they hit most of the good ones.

2301
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:34,640
But, alright, we'll see in chat, chat.orangelawnsradio.com if anybody thinks of anything.

2302
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:36,360
No Custer's Revenge either.

2303
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:40,200
There's usually a Custer's Revenge that shows up on the list like that.

2304
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:44,420
Alright, let's see what you guys have to say in our mailbag.

2305
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:49,560
Every week you guys email us, mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com, and we read your emails here live on the

2306
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:50,560
show.

2307
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:59,400
We'll send you the old mailbag and see what emails we've got.

2308
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:04,720
First email comes from Cheeseburger and it says, sorry I got you mad last week.

2309
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,600
Can you please tell me more about Gatchaman, please?

2310
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:07,600
Did I spell that right?

2311
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:08,600
Yes, she did spell it right.

2312
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:10,600
Gatchaman is awesome!

2313
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:16,440
1972 anime character designs done by Amano.

2314
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:20,520
Just go look it up on Wikipedia and then go watch all of it.

2315
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,360
That's the only way you'll appease me.

2316
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:23,360
Nice.

2317
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:25,000
Hey, OLR crew.

2318
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,680
This is the next email, by the way.

2319
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:31,560
After listening to last week's show, I figured right into clarifying what the Rob D was saying

2320
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:34,600
about me shaking while at the mic.

2321
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:39,160
It wasn't while at the mic that my hands started to shake, but after, it was a bit of a rush

2322
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:43,680
being on the air with a bunch of internet celebrities who are too humble to admit they

2323
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:46,000
really are celebrities, however minor.

2324
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,720
I am not.

2325
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:52,520
I am actually egotistical enough to admit my celebritydom on the internet.

2326
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,560
Curse you, adrenaline!

2327
01:51:54,560 --> 01:52:00,200
Anyway, it was great meeting you all at PAX and was very glad that I made it to Wild Ginger

2328
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:04,520
that night in one piece as the food and conversation were awesome.

2329
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:07,000
Who knew mango could make pork taste like beef?

2330
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,840
This is talking about the Chinese restaurant, all the games people went to, yeah?

2331
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,440
As I ordered the mango pork and it was freaking fantastic.

2332
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:16,360
Yeah, the food I had was good too.

2333
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:20,600
Plus I had to be the best Dan Padtai I've ever had, it made being lost in the scuzzy

2334
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,780
part of Seattle at night totally worth it.

2335
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:26,360
That was a really good Padtai, I agree with that because I had some too.

2336
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:31,560
I didn't just write to reminisce and sing praises though.

2337
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:35,080
A few episodes back you guys were talking about Dragon's Lair and Space Ace and they

2338
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:39,880
should be put on PS3, well good news, not only are they playable on PS3, but any Blu-ray

2339
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:40,880
player.

2340
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,520
I've actually had them in stock where I work for quite some time now and I'm kind of shocked

2341
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:51,240
they aren't on shelves with the games at other stores as well, he put links on Amazon.

2342
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:55,600
Actually I think, the reason I didn't get them is because I've already got the HD versions

2343
01:52:55,600 --> 01:53:01,140
for PC so, but I hope I passed the Grammar Nazi test here.

2344
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:07,120
You almost did, but for right is WRITE.R-I-G-H-T.

2345
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,400
I can't wait until next year's PAX assuming I can go.

2346
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,400
Cheers to Cypher.

2347
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:12,400
Yay.

2348
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:13,400
PS.

2349
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:18,360
This email was brought to you by the OLR Mailbag, home of the never-ending Olive Garden references.

2350
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:22,240
I wish I haven't had an Olive Garden reference in a little while, but there you go.

2351
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:23,240
Thank you.

2352
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:24,240
Rob, let's go to Olive Garden.

2353
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:25,240
Dude, I really want Olive Garden.

2354
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:26,240
We have to.

2355
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:30,020
You know where I went this week was Corrino's, good stuff.

2356
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:31,020
I've never been there.

2357
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,020
Nom nom nom.

2358
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:36,360
I'd take you to Pasquale's, but I don't think they have anything light though.

2359
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:40,280
Or we should go to a little, they have a little joint here in Sacramento called Espanol, which

2360
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,560
is the Italian place with a Spanish name.

2361
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:43,560
It's really good.

2362
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:44,560
Okay.

2363
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:45,560
I have a very yummy minestrone soup.

2364
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:46,560
Mmm.

2365
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,560
Orange launch foodie-o.

2366
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,560
Next email.

2367
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:49,560
Hey, OLR.

2368
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:50,560
Hi.

2369
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,520
I just have to say, I love that on this show when we're not talking about video games,

2370
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:54,520
we're talking about food.

2371
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:55,520
It's great.

2372
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,920
I have gushy foods.

2373
01:53:56,920 --> 01:54:00,880
Ooh, Rob D says never-ending pasta is going on at Olive Garden right now.

2374
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,560
Dude, we are there, okay?

2375
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:05,000
Never-ending pasta doesn't mean no good anyway.

2376
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Hey, my email.

2377
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Sorry.

2378
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Email.

2379
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Hey, OLR.

2380
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,480
I read this on the FAQs of EA's new Sports World site, which is their online community

2381
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,160
for their sports games.

2382
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:17,480
One of the questions is why there's no female avatar option.

2383
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:22,480
Their response was, quote, question, why is there no female avatar image?

2384
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:26,480
In effort to align EA's Sports World with our primary user base, the decision was made

2385
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,560
to use a male avatar image for its launch.

2386
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:31,800
However, a female avatar image is planned for future releases soon.

2387
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:35,320
Is it just me or are they making an assumption about who plays their games?

2388
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:40,880
I'm not a female, but I think that it is kind of sexist to gear a sports game towards males

2389
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:46,160
only and assume that all the women are playing Barbie Island Princess or baked cakes, although

2390
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:49,240
cakes are great.

2391
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:54,320
Maybe I am completely stupid and don't see why this is okay, but maybe, no, but I'm sure

2392
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:58,400
many women across the world play sports games and other types of traditionally male games

2393
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,880
like GTA, other FPSs, et cetera.

2394
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:05,120
Well, thanks for reading this, and remember, if you are in the all games chat room, DMN

2395
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:06,340
can't kick you.

2396
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:09,120
The cake is live, PK Junior 92, Yaris sucks.

2397
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:17,440
Well, you have to understand that until EA Sports releases, you know, Dinner Making 09,

2398
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:23,920
you know, they're not going to have female avatars, unfortunately.

2399
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:28,040
The Rob D says in chat, translation, their response was, girls don't play games.

2400
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,480
Is this true, Dark Sakura?

2401
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:31,920
Do girls not play games?

2402
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:34,000
I beg to differ.

2403
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I had a feeling.

2404
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I remember.

2405
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,920
I bet we have some more listeners out there that beg to differ as well.

2406
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:40,480
You remember, though, Rob.

2407
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,480
What?

2408
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:44,520
Remember me telling you that there was a football game I actually liked.

2409
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,520
Tecmo Bowl.

2410
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:46,800
No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl.

2411
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:52,680
It was, um, great, now I can't remember, but it had a cool name.

2412
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:56,840
It was that one football game that was, um, on Super Nintendo.

2413
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:58,560
Must have had a lasting impression.

2414
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:02,260
Well, no, I can never remember the name of it, too, was the problem with it.

2415
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:03,440
Was it with the four player thing?

2416
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:04,720
Was it Super Tecmo Bowl?

2417
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:07,280
No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl anything.

2418
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,280
High Impact or something?

2419
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:09,280
High Impact.

2420
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,280
Thank you.

2421
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:11,280
It was Super High Impact.

2422
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,280
I just had a feeling.

2423
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:14,520
And I said that before I saw Dark Sakura say it and shit.

2424
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:20,520
I was gonna say, also, that, um, yeah, girls don't play games and EA doesn't release games

2425
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,960
that aren't buggy.

2426
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,140
That just means that girls play good games.

2427
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:27,240
You know how I feel about sports games, you guys.

2428
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:32,160
Look, I respect those of you guys that choose to play them, but for me, Tecmo Bowl or GTFO?

2429
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:37,540
No, it was all about that hockey game on Saturn.

2430
01:56:37,540 --> 01:56:38,540
Or Blades of Steel.

2431
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:39,540
Blades of Steel.

2432
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:40,540
Thank you.

2433
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:41,540
Thank you.

2434
01:56:41,540 --> 01:56:42,540
Anyhow, go ahead.

2435
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:45,640
Hockey is fantastic, too, because, you know, blood bounces on ice.

2436
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:48,400
You know, NHL 09 came out this last week.

2437
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:49,400
We should check it out.

2438
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:51,560
I used to watch hockey regularly.

2439
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,600
Let's get into sports games.

2440
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:54,680
I wouldn't buy NHL 09.

2441
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:56,240
I want a rugby game.

2442
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:57,240
There's stories about it.

2443
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:59,160
I want someone to send me a rugby game, okay?

2444
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:03,820
Apparently it's got some sort of memory leak in the cache file on your hard drive and will

2445
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:05,680
stop working after a while.

2446
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:06,680
Oh, shit.

2447
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:09,720
Imagine if we came on the show one week, and during How Was Your Gaming week, suddenly

2448
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:12,320
it's like Jamie's talking about, yeah, I played NHL 09 this week.

2449
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,160
I'm like, yeah, I played Madden.

2450
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:19,080
Logie's like, I played Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

2451
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:20,680
And then we'd, never mind.

2452
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:27,440
No, it would be like, I was gonna say, then we'd be AGI, but you know.

2453
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,080
If you wanted to, sick burn.

2454
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:34,800
If you wanted to do the complete role reversal here, I would be playing Imagine Babies, and

2455
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,960
Rob would be playing Yaris, and Matt would be playing the Tingle Game.

2456
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:40,960
Nice.

2457
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:43,360
The Tingle Game, seriously.

2458
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:44,600
For April Fool's Day next year.

2459
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:45,600
All right, we'll have a nice email.

2460
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,600
Nice email.

2461
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:47,600
Hey guys, Dan Shadow here.

2462
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:51,280
I've been meaning to email you guys for quite some time, but I've been very busy lately.

2463
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:52,280
Welcome to the club.

2464
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:56,900
If this email seems long, it's because with every new episode, there's a new subject to

2465
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:58,120
talk about.

2466
01:57:58,120 --> 01:57:59,480
This segment goes to Rob.

2467
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:00,480
Hi, Rob.

2468
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:01,480
Hi, me.

2469
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:02,480
Who's this from?

2470
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:03,480
Dan Shadow.

2471
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,480
Hi, Dan Shadow.

2472
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:08,520
A while back, you mentioned going out to Long Beach and visiting the Queen Mary.

2473
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,480
I laughed when you mentioned that, because I currently live in Long Beach.

2474
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,520
Next year, I will be getting married on the Queen Mary.

2475
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,440
It's a big boat.

2476
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:16,440
My wedding will be booze-themed.

2477
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:17,440
Chew on that.

2478
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,440
Aww.

2479
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,440
I miss booze.

2480
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:22,840
I also wanted to point out that I am your Brazilian listener.

2481
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:26,760
I haven't been there in 10 years, because, well, it's just better to live here.

2482
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:31,200
However, I will return next summer to have my new wife meet my family there.

2483
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:32,720
Brazilian listener.

2484
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:33,720
Awesome.

2485
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:38,200
I've been craving Brazilian grill.

2486
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:39,800
You don't even know how long.

2487
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:40,800
You know what I'm talking about.

2488
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,360
Like the Espritu's Place in San Francisco.

2489
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:43,600
I've never been there, Rob.

2490
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:47,800
Oh, they have a thing like it in Sacramento now called Taste of Brazil or something like

2491
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:48,800
that.

2492
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:52,400
And basically, that's where they bring the big slabs of meat on the swords and just slice

2493
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,400
off a slab of meat.

2494
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:54,400
Do we have to order in Portuguese?

2495
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:55,760
No, I don't believe you do.

2496
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:56,760
You don't order at all.

2497
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:57,760
You just pay.

2498
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:58,760
You have a little dial.

2499
01:58:58,760 --> 01:58:59,760
It's a buffet.

2500
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:00,760
Green means go.

2501
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,760
Red means stop.

2502
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:02,760
Sweet.

2503
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:05,520
I don't want to be there when I'm eating meat again.

2504
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:07,360
Thinking about playing Warhammer online?

2505
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,360
Do it.

2506
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:11,840
I've been in the closed and open beta, and I can tell you right now it's worth it.

2507
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:12,840
Here's an example.

2508
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:17,040
Let's say you're a squig hunter, and you want to drop aggro.

2509
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,160
You don't feign death.

2510
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:22,480
Instead, you will piss yourself, and the enemy won't touch you after that.

2511
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:23,480
Nice.

2512
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:28,520
Yeah, the orcs and goblins are on the comedic side, but if you want to be serious cool,

2513
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:30,080
then play as the high elves.

2514
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:33,720
I will be in the head start, so if you decide to get it, let me know, and we can play on

2515
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:34,720
the same server.

2516
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,440
No, and the head server.

2517
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:37,440
Sorry.

2518
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,440
No.

2519
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:41,640
It says, I will be in the head start, so if you decide to play, blah, blah.

2520
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:43,680
On another note, I can't wait for LittleBigPlanet.

2521
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:46,200
That seems like a game that can't possibly get old.

2522
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:48,700
Oh, and Rotband 2 equals party night.

2523
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:51,440
This email is brought to you by Strong Bad.

2524
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:55,120
Keeping my Wii alive with his never-ending style.

2525
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:56,840
Very nice.

2526
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:59,920
You know, again, my only reservation about Warhammer.

2527
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,000
It's not that I don't think it'll be a decent game that'll fill my time, but I really worry

2528
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,440
about picking up another MMO, because when I play an MMO, all my other games suffer.

2529
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:14,800
I mean, go back and listen to my gaming weeks on certain episodes of

2530
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,800
I played Final Fantasy XI.

2531
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:16,800
I played Final Fantasy XI.

2532
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:17,800
Again.

2533
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:18,800
I played Warcraft.

2534
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:19,800
Again.

2535
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:24,540
Now is especially not the time of year to get sucked into a new MMO, but I am thinking

2536
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:25,540
about it.

2537
02:00:25,540 --> 02:00:26,540
Star Trek Online.

2538
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:27,540
Star Trek Online.

2539
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:34,360
And then, I have to admit, I read about the new Final Fantasy XI patch, it actually sounds

2540
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:35,360
pretty awesome.

2541
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,360
No!

2542
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:37,360
Don't do it, Rob!

2543
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,360
Don't do it!

2544
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:40,160
They're fixing it so that you can level easier, finally.

2545
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:44,480
If you can level by yourself, then it's better.

2546
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:48,400
You can level, like, let's say you're level 12 and your friend is level 70.

2547
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:53,800
Your level 70 friend can cap himself to 12 and level with you, and you guys both still

2548
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:56,040
get experience.

2549
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,880
So you can level at any level.

2550
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,360
Kinda neat.

2551
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:01,960
I will say level 1 forever!

2552
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:02,960
Seriously.

2553
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:08,240
I will not be playing this bullshit.

2554
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:10,240
Final Fantasy bullshit?

2555
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:14,120
Unless it's Penn and Teller's Final Fantasy bullshit, then I'll play that.

2556
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:16,040
I somehow don't see that happening.

2557
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:18,640
That should be a bullshit game, that'd be cool.

2558
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:22,520
I do see myself going out and at least checking out Warhammer for a month or two before I

2559
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:24,480
see myself going back to fixy.

2560
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,200
Alright, next email.

2561
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:28,200
Star Trek Online!

2562
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:29,440
Yeah, and then there's that.

2563
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:30,440
Star Trek Online!

2564
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:32,480
I'm hoping that gets delayed to 2010.

2565
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:33,480
Star Trek Online!

2566
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:34,480
Alright, shut up.

2567
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,480
Read the next email.

2568
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:36,480
Shut up and read.

2569
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:37,480
Jeez, Rob!

2570
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:39,800
Yeah, we'll bite my big bloody left toe.

2571
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,800
Sorry, that's my right toe.

2572
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:47,400
Hey guys, I've been listening to your podcast for about the last year.

2573
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:50,560
Even though I can't listen to it live because I have school.

2574
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:53,600
You guys are my favorite podcast and I never miss your show.

2575
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:55,600
I haven't been able to get a 360 yet.

2576
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:58,440
It sucks because my mom and dad won't let me get one.

2577
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:02,040
They think that I shouldn't get another system even though I want to trade in my PS2.

2578
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:08,680
Anyway, since I have nothing to do and want to save money, I've been playing free MMOs.

2579
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:10,440
Here are a couple and what they are.

2580
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:11,800
S4 League!

2581
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:16,720
This game is a third person shooter that has anime style graphics and these make it so

2582
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,660
you can do flips and other cool stuff like that.

2583
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:21,000
And that's at s4league.com.

2584
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,760
MapleStory!

2585
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:26,280
You probably heard of this one, but if you haven't, it's a platforming MMO that's kind

2586
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:28,760
of like Super Mario Brothers, but you use weapons.

2587
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:29,760
That's at Nexon.com.

2588
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:33,080
Again, these are all free and really fun.

2589
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:34,880
Thanks guys, keep up the great work.

2590
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:38,520
This email is brought to you by my Wii, PS2, GameCube, and any other system that I don't

2591
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:39,520
want anymore.

2592
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:42,840
Home to the never-ending dust that collects on them because they're outdated and my parents

2593
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:43,840
don't let me trade them in.

2594
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,840
Wow.

2595
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:45,840
Alrighty.

2596
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:54,480
I also do have to commend you on your fairly decent sentence structure and grammar.

2597
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,040
Gold star for this listener.

2598
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,040
You get a smiley face.

2599
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:00,640
By the way, Rob D., I was snickering during that email because I read this comment in

2600
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:05,640
chat from Rob D. talking about Penn and Teller's Final Fantasy XI bullshit.

2601
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:09,680
He says, wait, so you want Final Fantasy Desert Bus?

2602
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:12,640
Dude, you know what?

2603
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:15,960
Sometimes running from one end of the map to the other when you're not a high enough

2604
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:18,720
level to have a chocobo feels like playing Desert Bus.

2605
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:21,480
I'm not even fucking with you.

2606
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:22,480
You know what?

2607
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:26,840
My whole thing was when I did play the game and was too low to actually make it across

2608
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:31,040
the desert without dying, I skirted the wall.

2609
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:33,400
I was doing maze business.

2610
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:34,400
That's what you have to do.

2611
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,560
Skirt the wall and you hide.

2612
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:38,080
Like, oh my god, it's going to kill me.

2613
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,360
Okay, last one.

2614
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:40,360
Ready?

2615
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:41,360
Okay.

2616
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:42,360
Dun, dun, dun.

2617
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:46,440
This is Rob Rod, who originated that joke.

2618
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:48,440
So we have to give him props.

2619
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:49,440
Props.

2620
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:50,440
Hi, OLR.

2621
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:55,160
Well, I've been waiting all year for TNA Impact to come out and now it's finally released.

2622
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:57,320
I see nothing but terrible reviews for it.

2623
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:02,080
Bad grapple system, only five slots for created wrestlers, only a handful of moves, and so

2624
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:03,080
on.

2625
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:06,160
I really hope the other games I'm looking forward to this year, Dead Space and Silent

2626
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:07,920
Hill Homecoming, don't suck.

2627
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:10,660
How can a Silent Hill game suck, okay?

2628
02:04:10,660 --> 02:04:14,960
So I'd like to ask, what was the biggest disappointment that you guys ever had to face with games

2629
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,000
you were highly anticipating?

2630
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:22,080
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks.

2631
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:26,240
You know, I have to say, one of the first ones that jumps into my mind was Nintendogs.

2632
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:30,520
I hate to say it, it's not that Nintendogs is a bad game, but I just got so hyped for

2633
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:34,260
it at E3 that the bar got set so high that the game just couldn't live up to it.

2634
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:35,960
It really couldn't.

2635
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:38,960
I tried.

2636
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:42,640
I remember one time Dan and I, this is when Dan and I were playing a lot of wrestling

2637
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:51,720
games, and we rented, at the time, WWF, or was it, which one was the one that had Nitro

2638
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,720
for the wrestling?

2639
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:53,720
Hell if I know.

2640
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:59,780
At the time, they were still, they were still the WCW and the WWF.

2641
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:02,440
I've like played two wrestling games, okay?

2642
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:03,440
WrestleMania 2000 was great.

2643
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:07,280
I played WrestleMania on the NES, when you could play as like Hulk Hogan and Andre the

2644
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:13,320
Giant and Macho Man Savage, okay, I played that old school one, and then I played Rumble

2645
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:14,320
Roses.

2646
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:20,120
Rumble Roses was great, but at any rate, Dan and I decided that we were going to rent the,

2647
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:24,040
no it was Thunder, that was it, I think it was WCW Thunder.

2648
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:32,300
We rented it, got it home, played it for ten minutes, and called the Hollywood or Blockbuster

2649
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:38,040
that we got it from, and took it back, and they let us take out another game.

2650
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:39,040
It was that bad.

2651
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:44,840
I just remember that that has been the one, even Spice World didn't disappoint me that

2652
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:45,840
badly.

2653
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,920
At least you knew what you were going to get with Spice World.

2654
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:50,400
Yeah, sheiss.

2655
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:54,620
I got a night of endless laughs with Spice World, just, you know, we were, I guess we

2656
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:56,800
were drunk, but it was really funny.

2657
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:59,760
There is one game that disappointed me, but it was a Japanese release only, it was Super

2658
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:00,760
Producers.

2659
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:08,600
Super Producers was a game where you manage a pop idol's career, and it just disappointed

2660
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:14,920
me because it was a lot more language-intense than I was prepared for.

2661
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:27,940
Gears of War, Halo 3, Bullet Witch, and, oh there's one more, I know it, it's pretty ballsy

2662
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:29,640
putting Gears of War on that list.

2663
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:32,400
I didn't like it at all, I thought it was going to be really cool.

2664
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,200
Halo 3 I was just disappointed, it was just average.

2665
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:36,200
Halo 2.5.

2666
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:37,200
Yeah, pretty much.

2667
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:45,600
I don't know, I'm trying to think if there's anything else, Yars, I don't know.

2668
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:51,180
Rob D in chat says Mega Man X5 disappointed me a lot.

2669
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:54,960
More recently, that Infinite Undiscovery, although I'm hearing if you can get past the

2670
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:59,440
first couple hours that suck, it gets a lot better, so I'm trying to force myself to

2671
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,440
play it more.

2672
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:08,240
But now I have Rock Band, I just want to play Rock Band all day.

2673
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:10,200
And no other emails then, huh?

2674
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:14,060
Mailbag at Orangelaunchrated.com if you have some mail you would like to contribute for

2675
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:15,060
next week's show.

2676
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:19,520
In the meantime, a little more gaming news, and then the Skype line.

2677
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:23,320
There's a couple hacking and cracking stories we have.

2678
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:30,280
The first one is a modification someone made using the Xbox 360 messenger kit, and they

2679
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:34,600
turned it into a keyboard for the PSP, which is kind of cool.

2680
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:41,840
It uses just a little data port that you would connect your headphones to, and supposedly

2681
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:47,600
right now he's writing some drivers for homebrew stuff, so that's pretty cool.

2682
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:51,300
And then the second one is less of a hack, more of a mod.

2683
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:55,000
Someone has modded an NES into a toaster.

2684
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,140
And why?

2685
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:57,140
Because it's funny.

2686
02:07:57,140 --> 02:08:00,580
Wait, wait, wait, they made a Nintendo out of a toaster, or they turned a Nintendo into

2687
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:01,580
a toaster?

2688
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:06,720
They put a toaster, they have a toaster, and they put a Nintendo inside of it.

2689
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:13,080
And it actually has apparently some LED lights in the case that light up.

2690
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:17,460
I'm not sure if it lights up red like it's cooking, because that'd be pretty funny.

2691
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:24,740
But yeah, NES toaster.

2692
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:27,560
Does it pop up and go ding when something's done?

2693
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:28,560
No.

2694
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:30,560
Then what's the point?

2695
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:31,560
It's a toaster.

2696
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:34,620
Oh, well okay.

2697
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:35,620
It's a Nintoster.

2698
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:37,560
Nintoster, huh?

2699
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:40,840
How would you like to get paid money to play World of Warcraft?

2700
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:44,460
No this is not some spam email, it's actually a tie into the upcoming story here.

2701
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:52,440
The National Science Foundation gave $100,000 to do a study for World of Warcraft.

2702
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:56,840
It's to an informatics professor at UC Irvine, Bonnie Nardi.

2703
02:08:56,840 --> 02:09:01,320
What she's going to be researching is player gaming habits and culture, not only in the

2704
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:03,740
US but in China as well.

2705
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:07,880
Apparently she's already been out in the field actually looking at World of Warcraft players

2706
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:13,260
across internet cafes around Beijing, apparently talking about the differences in play styles,

2707
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:16,400
some of the similarities in the culture, kind of interesting.

2708
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:21,200
Here's a quote from the study, or from the lady involved with the study.

2709
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:24,880
The Chinese have invented some interesting ways to play with the in-game economy, not

2710
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:26,400
the real world economy.

2711
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:29,800
Ways that I have not observed here in two years of studying World of Warcraft.

2712
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:32,480
Chinese players are more attuned to the aesthetics of the game.

2713
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:34,260
At least they mentioned them in more interviews.

2714
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:38,800
They talked more about color schemes, animations, architecture, and so on more than American

2715
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:39,800
players.

2716
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:44,000
So she goes on to say that the Chinese players, they actually don't really play with the add-ons

2717
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,080
and modifications.

2718
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:49,360
They like the challenge of the core game, whereas in America we like to mod our game

2719
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:50,800
to hell.

2720
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:51,800
Kind of interesting.

2721
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:54,960
She's getting paid $100,000 to finish this research.

2722
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:59,080
She's doing it along with a student going after their doctoral, and will be doing some

2723
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:02,000
type of final paper that I'm sure will be published all over the internet when it's

2724
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
done.

2725
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,140
$100,000 to study WoW.

2726
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:08,760
You can really get a job doing anything.

2727
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:10,600
No, I guess that's neat.

2728
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,280
It's just kind of like, wow, there's a lot.

2729
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:15,880
I guess, but then you think about the complex layers, I guess there is a lot to study, but

2730
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:19,760
I'm just kind of curious what will be contributed to society from the results?

2731
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:23,800
Is it a way for us to better understand each other through games?

2732
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:25,520
Why don't people just actually socially interact?

2733
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:28,200
Oh, that's right, because people are scary.

2734
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,200
Yeah.

2735
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,440
People are scary.

2736
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:34,260
Well how about some more news?

2737
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:35,260
How about it?

2738
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:36,520
Would that make you giddy, Rob?

2739
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:37,520
Yes.

2740
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:52,360
Speaking, because we did have an email earlier regarding, excuse me, no, sorry, my, I stopped

2741
02:10:52,360 --> 02:10:53,360
working.

2742
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:57,400
Yeah, it was Warhammer, sorry.

2743
02:10:57,400 --> 02:11:03,540
There was an announcement put out that there are actually server types and server names

2744
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:06,120
for Warhammer Online, Age of Reckoning.

2745
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:13,360
There's Core Open RVR, which is Realm versus Realm, Roleplay, and Roleplay slash Open RVR.

2746
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,620
So that's pretty cool.

2747
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:23,360
It's going to have the standard gameplay, but you've got unrestricted PVP combat on

2748
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:31,880
the core server, and then on Realm versus Realm, you have to be flagged for combat to

2749
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:35,320
do PVP stuff.

2750
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:40,560
You can also, though, permanently flag people, though, on the Open Realm versus Realm servers.

2751
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:45,280
And of course, Roleplay servers are basically getting into your character, Roleplaying.

2752
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,280
We know this.

2753
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:49,760
Which hopefully they actually enforce, unlike in WoW.

2754
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:53,040
I mean, I guess you can file tickets in WoW, but it seems like you always get a bunch of

2755
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:57,460
a-holes on there, and they're like, haha, RP, and it's like, dude, you signed up for

2756
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:58,460
an RP server.

2757
02:11:58,460 --> 02:11:59,460
What the F were you expecting?

2758
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:00,460
I know, right?

2759
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:04,240
I've done a Roleplay server before for World of Warcraft.

2760
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:05,240
I had a lot of fun.

2761
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:06,800
I played a real bitch.

2762
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,440
Like that's, you know, any different.

2763
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:10,880
That's not Roleplaying, Jamie.

2764
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,880
That's real life.

2765
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:13,880
You see this ferret?

2766
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:16,440
I do.

2767
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:17,440
Bend over, Rob.

2768
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:18,440
No.

2769
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:19,440
No, no ferrets.

2770
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:28,440
But anyway, those are the type of servers that are out, so that's pretty cool.

2771
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:31,520
And I don't know which one I'm playing on yet, if I get the game.

2772
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:32,520
If.

2773
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:33,520
If.

2774
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:34,520
Sorry.

2775
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:43,320
I was, I was fascinated by the fact that apparently they changed the name of Africa in, uh, Japan

2776
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:46,080
to, uh, Akuna Matata.

2777
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,080
I'm serious.

2778
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:49,120
That's the actual title now.

2779
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:50,120
Akuna Matata.

2780
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:51,120
Akuna Matata.

2781
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:52,120
Seriously.

2782
02:12:52,120 --> 02:12:53,120
It's Africa.

2783
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:54,120
Disney will sue.

2784
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:55,120
I guess.

2785
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:59,560
No, it's, well, they didn't make it up, but that's interesting.

2786
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:01,120
I thought the game already came out in Japan.

2787
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:03,120
How did they change the name now?

2788
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:07,120
Okay, well, to be honest, this is the Asian reason, one, so I don't know.

2789
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:11,080
I would think that the names are the same, but I could be wrong.

2790
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:16,880
No, it's Africa and Japan, but apparently for Asia, it's Akuna Matata.

2791
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:18,120
I'm seriously thinking about buying this, though.

2792
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:20,840
That is the fucking raddest name for a game ever, though, you gotta admit.

2793
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:21,840
It's only $54.90.

2794
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:22,840
Really?

2795
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:23,840
With three dollars?

2796
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,280
But it's coming out here eventually, right?

2797
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:27,640
Eventually, but, I don't know.

2798
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:29,280
I like things I can get early.

2799
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:30,280
Whatever.

2800
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:31,760
Anyways, back on topic here.

2801
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,640
Bioshock.

2802
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:39,960
It's a PS3 game now, at least it will be in October, and as with most PS3 games, it will

2803
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:42,760
require an install, but don't worry.

2804
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:49,440
That'll be an entertaining 10 minutes as you watch Rapture-related advertisements and music.

2805
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:56,720
Awesome, and the install size, a whopping 4.98 gigabytes.

2806
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:59,480
Sucks if you have a 20 gig PS3.

2807
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:02,760
That kind of sucks.

2808
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:07,560
Oh, and the graphics are about the same as the Xbox 360.

2809
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:27,480
I wonder if this game is changing, which- is it too much to get the freaking chorus?

2810
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:36,280
Ugh, I just wanted the freaking chorus, but the little samples on iTunes have the little

2811
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:39,080
chorus pre-versus there.

2812
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:40,080
Lame.

2813
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:50,400
Hakuna Matata, da da da da da da, Hakuna Matata- hey, Harry Potter!

2814
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,800
Hakuna Matata, Harry Potter!

2815
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:53,800
It's almost the same thing, right?

2816
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:55,360
What do they have to do with each other, Rob?

2817
02:14:55,360 --> 02:15:00,480
Well, you know that the Harry Potter movie got pushed back to the disgust of 14-year-old

2818
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:04,400
girls everywhere, and some girls that think- no, I'm just kidding, obviously there's a

2819
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:10,180
ton of people that are really into Harry Potter, disgustingly so almost, and instead they're

2820
02:15:10,180 --> 02:15:14,640
getting Twilight out in the movie theaters this Christmas, but Harry Potter got pushed

2821
02:15:14,640 --> 02:15:15,640
back to next summer.

2822
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:19,760
Well, this should be kind of a duh, but the game got pushed back as well.

2823
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:23,240
That's right, EA confirmed this week that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the

2824
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:28,720
game has been delayed, and even though I would think the game is pretty much done, but maybe

2825
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:31,160
they'll take some time to go back and tweak it.

2826
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:35,280
What's kind of sad about this, though, is that EA now is not going to get the profits

2827
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:37,900
from this game until their next fiscal quarter.

2828
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:40,240
That's a loss.

2829
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:41,820
Oops.

2830
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:46,760
So Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will be out in video game form when the movie

2831
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:50,920
comes out, summer 2009, and I'm sure a lot of you kids can't wait.

2832
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:53,280
Are we getting a Twilight video game?

2833
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:54,280
No.

2834
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:56,280
That's what I want to know.

2835
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:57,280
No?

2836
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:58,280
Where's that tie-in?

2837
02:15:58,280 --> 02:16:00,560
It's, uh, I don't know.

2838
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:05,080
I want my sparkling vampires in a video game, come on.

2839
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:07,720
Vampires that sparkle?

2840
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:08,720
That's too cool.

2841
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:15,880
Hey, our Skype line's open at Orange Launch Radio, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2842
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:20,520
Real quickly, though, some last minute stories, Loki, I know you had something about EA and

2843
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:21,680
Take-Two, right?

2844
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:22,680
Yes.

2845
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:23,680
The final nail in the coffin.

2846
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:24,920
Breaking news!

2847
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:28,160
EA gives up on Take-Two acquisition.

2848
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,160
It's official.

2849
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:32,520
They will not buy them out.

2850
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:36,600
And apparently EA has released this.

2851
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:41,640
Electronic Arts today announced that while EA continues to have high regard for Take-Two's

2852
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:46,800
creative teams and products, after careful consideration, including a management presentation

2853
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:53,640
and review of other due diligence materials provided by Take-Two, EA has decided not to

2854
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:58,240
make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions with Take-Two.

2855
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:03,320
Really, could it be all those times that they said, no, no, no, stop bothering me, no, no,

2856
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:05,480
no, no, no, no, no?

2857
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:09,000
Maybe it just took them going, la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

2858
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
thing.

2859
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:14,240
I can't see you, I can't hear you, la la la la la la la la.

2860
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:19,040
Skypline's open 1-877-GAMO-LR, your username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, we're gonna

2861
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:21,640
take some calls.

2862
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:22,640
We'll start here.

2863
02:17:22,640 --> 02:17:23,640
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2864
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:24,640
My name is Aku.

2865
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:25,640
Hey, it's Aku.

2866
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:28,640
What's on your mind, my friend?

2867
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:33,840
Not much, just chilling on a boring Sunday night, except for you guys, we're just making

2868
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:34,840
it all better.

2869
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:35,840
Thank you.

2870
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:36,840
Oh, yeah.

2871
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:38,760
Hey, you're getting DDRX this week?

2872
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:39,760
You're a DITR fan?

2873
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:45,720
Well, I'm on a wait and see right now, and since I'm unemployed and I need work right

2874
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:53,080
now, I need to hold off on spending, you know, splurging money on, like, luxury such as video

2875
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:54,080
games.

2876
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:55,080
Well, that's definitely understandable.

2877
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:59,280
Yeah, you know the location just happened, you know, last week, right?

2878
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:03,000
Actually, throughout the better part of last week, it just ended today.

2879
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Oh, yeah, how'd that go?

2880
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:12,360
Dude, uh, from what I've known, from what those folks were able to test out there, it's

2881
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:14,200
shaping up to be a pretty good mix.

2882
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:16,160
Now, I have a real quick question.

2883
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:19,800
DDRX, isn't that supposed to be coming out soon in the arcades, or are they...

2884
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:20,800
Yeah.

2885
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:23,600
I mean, they tested the arcade, and they were testing it last week.

2886
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:24,600
Yeah, exactly.

2887
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:25,600
Okay, Rob, you remember that...

2888
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:26,600
What?

2889
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:29,800
Um, you went into that store, Gamer's Empire, with me, remember, by the Folsom Theater?

2890
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:31,200
I didn't go into it, but I...

2891
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:32,200
You know of it, yeah.

2892
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:33,200
I know of it, yeah.

2893
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:38,240
I've been in the front of their, um, store into an arcade now, and they have told me

2894
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:40,720
that they are probably gonna get DDRX.

2895
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:41,720
Well...

2896
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:43,120
That'd be fucking awesome.

2897
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:47,140
Well, it depends on whether or not they just buy the full cab, or the upgrade kit.

2898
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:49,640
It's gonna be the full freaking cabinet.

2899
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:51,320
They said it's really expensive.

2900
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:56,580
Remember, that cab that was used in the location test is not final, it's kind of like a prototype

2901
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:57,580
right now.

2902
02:18:57,580 --> 02:19:02,160
It's a work, you know, it's basically a test pad for what, you know, what Konami is trying

2903
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:06,400
to do, according to what the rep said over there.

2904
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:10,560
And they're ditching Betsy, which is great news, since now Konami is restarting their

2905
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:11,560
arcade division.

2906
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:13,920
Oh, I didn't know they were restarting it.

2907
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:14,920
That's pretty cool.

2908
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:19,220
Yeah, because that's, that's what the, you know, the folks, the guys who were running

2909
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:23,880
the test, you know, the folks in the arcade, you know, Konami's arcade division, that's

2910
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:26,080
what they were telling the folks who were at the test.

2911
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:27,080
Nice.

2912
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:28,420
They said we're starting over.

2913
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:29,420
We are starting over.

2914
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:32,620
Yes, indeed, yes, and that's how they mean it.

2915
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:35,680
Does this mean we might get Silent Hill Arcade Game over here finally?

2916
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:43,160
Well, it means that no, you know, unfortunately we won't have that American incompetence holding

2917
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:48,240
back certain, you know, basically taining the good name of DDR with shitty cabs and

2918
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:49,560
just piss poor service.

2919
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:54,000
It means that Konami is actually, if they want, they're actually doing something right,

2920
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,240
they're actually doing it themselves this time.

2921
02:19:57,240 --> 02:20:01,440
Well, any other thoughts, Zaku, on your mind before we get to another call?

2922
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:07,840
Um, just the fact that secure ROM and EA is just, just killing PC gaming.

2923
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:14,000
Ah, yes, the whole DRM, I'm sure you can't run away from this discussion somewhere on

2924
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
the internet.

2925
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,920
We were just talking about it with Bobby on his show a little bit, when we were doing

2926
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:23,640
the little toss over that he does at the end of his show, you know, it's, it's unfortunate

2927
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:26,460
that the people who are actually selling out the money to get the games are the ones that

2928
02:20:26,460 --> 02:20:27,460
are getting punished.

2929
02:20:27,460 --> 02:20:30,720
See, I was going to buy Command & Conquer, you know, I was going to buy Red Alert 3 until

2930
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:37,720
I found out that it was basically boiled down to something almost, almost akin to a rental.

2931
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:42,560
And that's something I'm not cool with because I don't want to be, you know, first and foremost

2932
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:46,560
I, there's no way I'm going to be treated as a criminal first.

2933
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:48,800
And then have to prove my, you know, my innocence.

2934
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:54,160
It's not the, you know, it's innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.

2935
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:58,080
It does, it does make me wish that the game would come out on consoles, you know, because

2936
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,600
it's sad because it's sad for PC gamers.

2937
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:04,920
I would want it, I would want to use my keyboard and mouse instead of the controller.

2938
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:08,360
You can use, technically you can use the keyboard on 360, it's just there's really only one

2939
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:09,360
game that it sustains.

2940
02:21:09,360 --> 02:21:12,080
Well the game, well the game support those two peripherals, that's what I want to know.

2941
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:13,080
I wish it would.

2942
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:17,760
If not, then I might as well just, you know, just skip it until they, they ditch the, the

2943
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:21,240
protections on the PC version, which is the one I wanted to buy in the first place.

2944
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:22,240
All right.

2945
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:26,560
It just, it just sucks, you know, it had to be like that, but hopefully we'll, you know,

2946
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:28,920
we'll hit EA where it hurts, in their wallets.

2947
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:29,920
Well, we'll see what happens.

2948
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:33,200
All right, Zacko, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one, okay?

2949
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:34,200
All right, you too.

2950
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:35,200
Take care.

2951
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:36,200
By the way, thank you.

2952
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:40,720
Somebody in chat reminded me that I completely forgot to do the OLR pre-show Twit, because

2953
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:44,120
I did it for a story that came up a little later in the show, but we were talking about

2954
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:48,120
Warhammer just a little bit ago, and the server's coming up, and that the game is actually launching

2955
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:49,120
this week.

2956
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:54,240
So we actually asked this week on our pre-OLR Twit, which is available at our Twitter, our

2957
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:57,960
username is OLR, we actually asked people, are you going to buy Warhammer online?

2958
02:21:57,960 --> 02:22:01,440
Are you currently a Warcraft player that's considering leaving for Warhammer?

2959
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:03,480
Here's some of the responses we got via Twitter.

2960
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:08,760
GS68 says, I don't play MMOs, except the real occasional Albatross 18.

2961
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:11,200
And I apologize if I mispronounce your names, guys.

2962
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:14,040
Dustoise says, I'm actually waiting for champions online.

2963
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:18,160
I love City of Heroes villains and would love an updated, better version of that.

2964
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:21,760
Tiara says, nope, still waiting patiently for Star Trek Online.

2965
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:26,520
Pika Uno says, simply, hell no.

2966
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:28,840
Dartitsuya says, I'm just waiting for Diablo 3.

2967
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:33,480
DJ Tyrant says, no and no, I've seen the war beta, and it looks very similar to WoW, and

2968
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,320
I'm not a huge PvP player.

2969
02:22:35,320 --> 02:22:37,440
If I were, I might leave.

2970
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:43,320
Geovdea, sorry if I mispronounced that name, says, I'm waiting for Guild Wars 2.

2971
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:48,140
MistyOLR says, yeah, I'm with GS68, who said I don't play MMOs, 100% on this one.

2972
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:50,640
My damn attention span doesn't help things either.

2973
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:52,860
Quel Tipo says, will there be bards?

2974
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:55,640
If so, yes, give me a damn bard already, people.

2975
02:22:55,640 --> 02:23:00,120
I hate to say it, but Fefixi has bards, and it's actually a pretty awesome class to play.

2976
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:04,120
ActDeaf says, considering that I was never into MMOs, Warhammer, even though it looks

2977
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:05,840
good, I won't be picking it up.

2978
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:08,520
MMOs are never-ending repeat cycles.

2979
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:10,960
MeowFrog says, I'm not buying Warhammer.

2980
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:11,960
I may later on.

2981
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:13,640
However, I do still play WoW.

2982
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:16,080
I have friends who have canceled their account for Warhammer.

2983
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:18,120
I actually know people that have done the same thing.

2984
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:22,200
We used to do a big raiding alliance to do the 25-mans, and a bunch of them have quit

2985
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:23,200
to go to Warhammer.

2986
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:24,200
It's something else.

2987
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:29,880
Lastly, here's another one I'll probably mispronounce, SpongeTwang says, not buying Warhammer online.

2988
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:34,880
Currently playing WoW sparingly as is, using spare and spare time for DDR.

2989
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:39,460
So I'd like to point out, out of those 12 responses, not a single person said they're

2990
02:23:39,460 --> 02:23:40,460
buying Warhammer.

2991
02:23:40,460 --> 02:23:41,460
Uh-oh.

2992
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:45,600
But we did have people saying that their friends are getting it, so maybe it's not going to

2993
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:47,840
be a huge game.

2994
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:51,920
And certainly we have a very unscientific sample, but there you go.

2995
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:52,920
And thank you, it's GeovayDay.

2996
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:58,920
I just have to say it with a little accent there, GeovayDay, sorry for mispronouncing

2997
02:23:58,920 --> 02:23:59,920
your name horribly.

2998
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:00,920
Okay, more calls, yes?

2999
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:01,920
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3000
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:02,920
Who's this?

3001
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:03,920
Hey, it's ParadoxVincent, what's up guys?

3002
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:04,920
Hey, ParadoxVincent, how are you?

3003
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:13,600
Don't forget to turn your radio down in the background, we were hearing ourselves a little

3004
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:14,600
bit there.

3005
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:15,600
What's on your mind, buddy?

3006
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:21,640
Um, well, not much, I just wanted to give a big shoutout to you guys for playing, uh,

3007
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:25,720
I'm Having Trouble Beating Airman from Mario Paint, I really like that.

3008
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:30,000
That was all Jamie, she picks the background music you're going to hear when she does the

3009
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:36,480
Classic Game of the Week, so a nice little reference there to other great gaming things.

3010
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:40,060
Yeah, I'm pretty much obsessed with that song.

3011
02:24:40,060 --> 02:24:43,780
What is it about that song that has you obsessed?

3012
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:49,920
I don't know, I just, well, I found it on YouTube a really long time ago, and I just

3013
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:55,360
kept listening to it and kept listening to it, and it's just a nice little Japanese rock

3014
02:24:55,360 --> 02:25:02,000
song from some Japanese indie band, and it's about Mega Man and I can't go wrong with that.

3015
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,240
It sounds like you could go on a Mega Man game though, right?

3016
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:12,000
Maybe Mega Man 10, they should have a best of, Mega Man All Stars, as the best monsters

3017
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,000
from all the games.

3018
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,480
Do you like watching the videos that they make for these?

3019
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:22,080
I don't know if you heard that, do you like watching the videos that they make for these?

3020
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:28,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's my favorite part, that's one of my favorite parts of those little videos,

3021
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:33,840
I don't exactly know if they just hand animated them or if they're all pixeled, but yeah,

3022
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:36,200
that's one of my favorite parts about it.

3023
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:39,320
Alright, well, very cool.

3024
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:41,200
Anything else you've been playing lately?

3025
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:47,840
Yeah, actually, well, I mean, I haven't really been playing it, but, well I guess I have,

3026
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:53,800
a few weeks ago I went over to a party and I really started playing on my friend's PS3,

3027
02:25:53,800 --> 02:26:01,840
and I used to really bash the PS3, but you know, lately, and he sat me down, and, can

3028
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:04,560
I do a really quick plug here?

3029
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:07,160
Sure.

3030
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:15,520
It's my friend's website, his name is Frank Castle, and he runs this community called

3031
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:17,840
Arizona Hobbyist Paradise, what?

3032
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:21,880
He's not the Punisher, is he?

3033
02:26:21,880 --> 02:26:22,880
Yeah.

3034
02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:27,160
Frank Castle is the Punisher's name, sorry.

3035
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:28,160
Nice.

3036
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:30,680
Alright, so he runs a comic thing in Arizona?

3037
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:41,160
Yeah, well it's called Arizona Hobbyist Paradise, and it's at hobbyistparadise.com, and it's

3038
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:47,480
just for like AZ Arizona people who like gaming, anime, and comics, but I was playing on his

3039
02:26:47,480 --> 02:26:53,640
PS3, and then he sat me down, and then he's like, you know, the PS3 is starting to really

3040
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:57,760
gain a lot of ground in the gaming industry, and I obviously disagreed with him, but then

3041
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:03,760
he showed me this big list, and I mean, I'm looking at the PS3 exclusives right now, and

3042
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:08,800
it used to kind of be like the big joke of gaming, but I'm really thinking about picking

3043
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:11,200
up a PS3 really soon.

3044
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:15,360
I do want one for LittleBigPlanet and Home, definitely has me curious, but I think Sony

3045
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:19,320
still has a long way to go, and that's kind of been a theme with them lately, and that's

3046
02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:22,680
kind of worrisome, you know, they were allowed to do a little bit of a slow launch with the

3047
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:27,720
PlayStation 2, because, you know, it was really the only thing out there, if I remember, I

3048
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:31,840
don't know when it first came out, but with the PSP, you know, there wasn't a lot of must-have

3049
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:35,680
games on the PSP, and a lot of those patches that enabled the internet and all those things

3050
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:38,240
came out a long time after the release.

3051
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:41,920
Remember, the PSP didn't do a whole lot when it was first released, I mean, yeah, it played

3052
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:45,320
music, but the memory on it was so little.

3053
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:53,160
It's interesting to see that Sony's consoles have taken a long time to grow, just interesting.

3054
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:58,840
I'm wondering, have you ever heard of the, I think it's, yeah, The Last Guy?

3055
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:00,440
Um, no.

3056
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:04,400
Yeah, it's The Last Guy, it's that one that was like that game in work time fun.

3057
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,400
Oh!

3058
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:07,440
The one where it uses like the Google Map-esque stuff.

3059
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:12,800
Oh, okay, yeah, I think I remember hearing about this on a previous show, yeah.

3060
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:17,560
And also, uh, Hane, Hane looked pretty, it looked interesting.

3061
02:28:17,560 --> 02:28:22,160
Eh, I hear it's a little silly, but okay, I mean, it's different.

3062
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:31,280
I just think that, and Hane, if I'm not mistaken, isn't that a title that you buy on the PlayStation

3063
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:32,280
Network?

3064
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,280
Yes, it is.

3065
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:36,160
That's one of those games I think that you can now get on your PSP as well through the

3066
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:37,160
whole little...

3067
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:38,160
No.

3068
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:39,160
No?

3069
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:40,160
It's not?

3070
02:28:40,160 --> 02:28:41,160
No.

3071
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:42,160
I thought it was.

3072
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,160
So, cause you know how some of those PlayStation Network games are coming on the PSP, like

3073
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:45,160
Flow was one of them, I know?

3074
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:46,160
Yeah.

3075
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:47,160
That's interesting.

3076
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:48,160
Yeah.

3077
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:49,160
Echo Chrome.

3078
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:53,360
Alright, well, anything else, Paradox Vincent, before we let you go?

3079
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:54,640
Um, not all that much.

3080
02:28:54,640 --> 02:28:57,360
Alright, well, have a good one, buddy.

3081
02:28:57,360 --> 02:28:58,360
You too.

3082
02:28:58,360 --> 02:29:00,160
Next time I see you, I'll break your arms.

3083
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:01,660
Oh, ow.

3084
02:29:01,660 --> 02:29:02,660
Why would you do that?

3085
02:29:02,660 --> 02:29:03,660
That's mean.

3086
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:05,920
Zondief would do it.

3087
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,840
Oh, okay.

3088
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:09,640
Why would someone threaten to break my arms?

3089
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:13,200
Now if my arms really do get broken, I have it on tape, and I can sue.

3090
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:19,120
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

3091
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:20,120
All one word.

3092
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:22,720
We've got time for maybe like one more call, I think.

3093
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:24,720
We'll probably do tonight.

3094
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:25,720
Alright.

3095
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:28,760
Hey, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3096
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:31,640
Hi, it's SSJ100Matt from New York.

3097
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:34,640
Well hello SSJ100Matt from New York, how are you?

3098
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:35,640
I'm good, thanks.

3099
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:40,320
I was just thinking the other day, I miss New York City.

3100
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:41,320
You should definitely come.

3101
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:44,160
I want to come back and visit, I just don't know when I'm realistically going to make

3102
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:47,300
it happen, cause I'm very likely taking two trips to LA.

3103
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:51,200
There is a very small chance I might be able to pull through and do BlizzCon after all,

3104
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:54,680
but more on that when I find out for sure, I don't want to jinx it.

3105
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:55,680
So we'll see.

3106
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:58,840
Well what's on your mind, buddy?

3107
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:04,800
Well first off, I wanted to profess my love to Castle Crashers.

3108
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:08,300
I think everyone who has a 360 needs to get it now.

3109
02:30:08,300 --> 02:30:10,800
What is it about Castle Crashers that you love?

3110
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:14,920
I don't know, it just brings back my old love of the classic beat-em-ups like Turtles in

3111
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:15,920
Time.

3112
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:17,880
Turtles in Time is great.

3113
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:20,120
It just reminds me of that.

3114
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:24,760
I don't know though, the demo kind of got a little old for me, but I need to get the

3115
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:29,520
full version I think, cause it does look like the little other aspects of upgrades and roleplay-esque

3116
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,920
elements they put in there look kind of cool.

3117
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:34,840
I didn't want to review the game based off a demo alone, especially when everybody else

3118
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:36,880
is saying such wonderful things about it.

3119
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:39,560
Also I've been playing the game by myself, and I imagine it's the type of game that's

3120
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:41,400
much more fun with more people.

3121
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:43,920
But I hear online it's broken.

3122
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:44,920
Yeah online it's broken.

3123
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:48,600
You know what, I haven't really been playing online, mostly my friends have been bugging

3124
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:49,600
me to come play.

3125
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:55,760
I'm actually getting texted right now asking to come over and play it.

3126
02:30:55,760 --> 02:31:02,960
But yeah, it's lots of fun, and it's kind of a good party game if you have a group of

3127
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:05,600
people who are all about it.

3128
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:07,800
Sure, sure.

3129
02:31:07,800 --> 02:31:10,960
And Rob D kind of sums up what I'm thinking, he's in the chat right now, he says, I'm enjoying

3130
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:14,000
Castle Crashers, but I'm not really digging the combat gameplay.

3131
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,000
I do like the art style and the music, but I'm not liking the characters or the attacking.

3132
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:23,280
Yeah, I mean the game's got a certain quirkiness about it that's very cool, that piques my

3133
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:24,280
interest.

3134
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:29,680
But I don't know, the old school Ninja Turtles arcade game gameplay kind of got old a little

3135
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:30,680
while ago.

3136
02:31:30,680 --> 02:31:33,880
Well I don't know, maybe it's not too completely fair to say.

3137
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:35,480
When you waste all your quarters on it.

3138
02:31:35,480 --> 02:31:39,440
Yeah true, true, very true.

3139
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:44,120
The other thing I want to talk about is, you guys kind of mentioned this before, is NHL

3140
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:45,120
09.

3141
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:46,120
Yes.

3142
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:51,600
And I managed to pick that up yesterday, and you know what, I'm a big hockey fan, if anyone

3143
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:54,560
who listens to Understudiation Live, I always call in about that.

3144
02:31:54,560 --> 02:32:02,940
But no, I think this is one of the better hockey games because of the whole online interaction

3145
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:04,120
that they have.

3146
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:06,360
What's so special about the online interaction real quick?

3147
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:15,320
Well basically with it is, they kind of made hockey into an MMO, where you create a player

3148
02:32:15,320 --> 02:32:21,920
and you can take them onto a custom team where you know, you can have a bunch of friends

3149
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:27,920
or like what we have with all games, we've decided to make an all games team.

3150
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:28,920
Cool.

3151
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:36,680
Does everybody play as one character on the team, or how does it work?

3152
02:32:36,680 --> 02:32:40,360
You play as one position on the team, or player.

3153
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:43,720
So you can either play goalie, you can play center, you can play any position.

3154
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:50,400
You can all play at once, and you know it's lots of fun, and so yeah we're trying to rally

3155
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:58,200
every show to get some of their viewers on to make the all games team.

3156
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:04,000
So I think we got about a decent number of 10 people, and I think we got Hendrix on there

3157
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:09,640
from Super Happy Fun Time Show, I think he's the captain on there, and you know it's just

3158
02:33:09,640 --> 02:33:10,720
lots of fun.

3159
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:16,080
We've already played a couple games I think, we're ranked number 5 in the 11th division.

3160
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:17,080
Wow.

3161
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:21,080
Well if any OLR people want to get in on that, I know we don't have a whole lot of sports

3162
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:26,520
game nuts here, but you know I know there's some, where can they go for more information?

3163
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:33,600
Well you can go on the OLR forums, I posted a topic about that, or you can go on the all

3164
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:39,600
games forums under, you know, we're playing sports, some of that.

3165
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:42,200
Alright NHL 09 online.

3166
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:43,200
Very cool.

3167
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:45,960
Alright well we got to let you go, we're going to start to wrap things up, but thanks so

3168
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:46,960
much for your call, okay?

3169
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:47,960
Yep.

3170
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:48,960
Alright take care everybody.

3171
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:49,960
Yep.

3172
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:50,960
Bye.

3173
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:51,960
Very cool.

3174
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:55,720
Wow, I think we've talked more about sports games tonight than we have like in a year

3175
02:33:55,720 --> 02:34:01,280
on Orange Launch Radio, but that's okay, we want to give an equal opportunity to all games.

3176
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:04,560
Let's see, we're going to wrap things up here, but I did get a private message I wanted to

3177
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:05,560
read here.

3178
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:09,440
James Patrick says, talk about Dragon Quest IV real quick, it's coming out on the 16th,

3179
02:34:09,440 --> 02:34:11,760
I'm trying to call but I probably won't get through.

3180
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:15,760
Ah yes, another Dragon Quest, you know if it's as good as the Final Fantasy IV remake,

3181
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:16,880
it'd probably be worth checking out.

3182
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:20,720
I think a lot of people in this country played Final Fantasy, but not nearly as many played

3183
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:23,680
Dragon Quest, so I'm sure a lot of people missed this the first time around.

3184
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:26,400
I don't know, do you know anything additional about this title release, Loki?

3185
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:29,800
Ah, that's Dragon Quest, I'm not a fan of Dragon Quest.

3186
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:30,800
Really?

3187
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:31,800
Why not?

3188
02:34:31,800 --> 02:34:32,800
You just don't like slobs?

3189
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:36,120
I just never got into it, I tried playing Dragon Warrior like the first one a long time

3190
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:38,840
ago and just never really got into it.

3191
02:34:38,840 --> 02:34:42,040
I beat the first one on Nintendo, I was hardcore.

3192
02:34:42,040 --> 02:34:45,600
Now granted I used the strategy guide to do it, but you know, I can admit it, I needed

3193
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:46,600
a little help.

3194
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:47,600
Rob cheated.

3195
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:48,600
I did not cheat!

3196
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:49,600
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

3197
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,440
I had help.

3198
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:55,520
It was officially sanctioned, it wasn't one of those things where for a while if you bought

3199
02:34:55,520 --> 02:35:00,120
the game you got the stupid thing free, the guidebook, which I always thought was a little

3200
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:03,360
weird, but I'm pretty sure you did through Nintendo Power or something.

3201
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:05,240
Um, what was I going to say?

3202
02:35:05,240 --> 02:35:06,240
It's been a long time.

3203
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:11,520
Yeah, I don't know, I didn't even try Dragon Quest VIII, remember, well actually-

3204
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:12,520
It was cool!

3205
02:35:12,520 --> 02:35:14,900
Dragon Quest VIII is actually really fun, I want to go back and beat it.

3206
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:17,080
It was actually a lot, a lot of fun.

3207
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:21,800
It was like an old school Super Nintendo Role Playing game, but with like 3D graphics.

3208
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:22,800
Yeah.

3209
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:23,800
I don't know.

3210
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:25,960
It's not my thing, I guess.

3211
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:29,680
I don't know, I still have to go back and finish Lost Odyssey, so, I mean, shit.

3212
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:34,240
I am not buying any more RPGs until I finish Lost Odyssey.

3213
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:35,240
So it may be a while.

3214
02:35:35,240 --> 02:35:40,400
Last- in all these like Square Enix, you know, offshoot games, you know, like Last

3215
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:44,840
Remnant and Infinite Undiscovery, I don't know if I should even try those, cause I mean-

3216
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:49,560
You know, I am being persuaded by a listener that Infinite Undiscovery may not be as bad

3217
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:53,160
as the first two hours make it seem, but boy, what a crappy way to start the game is just

3218
02:35:53,160 --> 02:35:54,160
running from things.

3219
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:59,140
I mean, it's just, ugh, kind of frustrating, but I'm gonna try to, try to suck it up and

3220
02:35:59,140 --> 02:36:02,120
try to get a little further, cause I like the part that I played at Penny Arcade Expo

3221
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:05,680
and that bugged me, like, why isn't the game as cool as I remember, was I, was it just

3222
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:10,600
that whole like, con, you know, like, you know how games always seem better at a con

3223
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:12,620
cause you're caught up in the moment of a convention?

3224
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:19,400
I don't know if this is, um, exactly a good comparison in its defense, but that's how

3225
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:23,480
we started Final Fantasy VIII is running from things.

3226
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:27,360
Mmm, I don't know though, Final Fantasy VIII kind of sucked too in its own way.

3227
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:29,880
I liked Final Fantasy VIII, it was alright.

3228
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:33,000
I did not, you know, I feel- junctioning single-handedly ruined, or drawing magic single-handedly

3229
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
ruined Final Fantasy VIII for me, so.

3230
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Okay, maybe that.

3231
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Alright.

3232
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:40,260
Anyhow, we're gonna wrap up the show, we gotta, uh, get on out of here, so, uh, we can't leave

3233
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:43,040
though until we get, uh, more last minute stories, I don't know if there are any.

3234
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:44,040
Yes.

3235
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:46,040
Like I can get on the internet?

3236
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:47,240
Oh, sorry.

3237
02:36:47,240 --> 02:36:52,080
In case you were wondering if Rock Revolution for the Wii is gonna be good, apparently it's

3238
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:53,080
not.

3239
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:59,040
Just, you know, throwing it out there, um, Kotaku actually got to preview the game at

3240
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:06,520
a Nintendo party, uh, last Friday, and, um, apparently the game itself on the Wii, there

3241
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:11,220
is no peripheral support whatsoever, even if you happen to do own, like, a drum set

3242
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:18,120
for the Wii, you can't use it, and, um, you basically get three columns of, um, notes

3243
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:23,060
that scroll down the screen, and you have to use either the C or D button, and strum

3244
02:37:23,060 --> 02:37:26,360
with- by moving the remote up and down.

3245
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:32,380
Um, apparently it's tiring, and, um, also I guess there's maracas in there at some point

3246
02:37:32,380 --> 02:37:33,380
too.

3247
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:35,940
And, uh, sucks, and it's not very accurate.

3248
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:43,280
So, once again, Konami taking the cheap-ass route, I don't know, so that's kind of lame.

3249
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:49,880
And, um, of course, kind of on the topic of Nintendo here, they will not be at E for All,

3250
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:55,960
and, um, yeah, apparently they just didn't want to go, it's not in their plans, um, I

3251
02:37:55,960 --> 02:38:01,160
do remember, if I heard correctly, that they're gonna be showing off their games there anyways,

3252
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:05,480
at like some Target booth or something, I guess they actually sell games at this expo,

3253
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:06,960
which is weird.

3254
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:14,600
And, um, Namco Bandai has said that they're planning on making more Xbox Live Arcade remakes

3255
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:20,800
of classic, um, arcade games, uh, much like they've done with Pac-Man Championship Edition

3256
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:22,800
and Galaga Legions.

3257
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:27,440
No word on exactly what they're, uh, planning, but, you know, more games.

3258
02:38:27,440 --> 02:38:33,000
Um, one suggestion, I guess, says that the team is working on a Pole Position remake,

3259
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:37,960
which is interesting, and this, uh, little bit, I thought I'd throw this out for you,

3260
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:44,600
Rob, um, it's not exactly news, but there's a Dreamcast console available on playasia.com,

3261
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:46,240
that's the Hello Kitty Special Edition.

3262
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:47,240
Yay!

3263
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:50,200
I've actually seen that in a store before, it's been out a while.

3264
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:51,200
Yeah.

3265
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:53,360
But they're hard to find, really, really hard to find.

3266
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:54,360
Yeah.

3267
02:38:54,360 --> 02:38:55,360
So, that's it.

3268
02:38:55,360 --> 02:38:56,360
Alright.

3269
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:57,360
Cool, cool.

3270
02:38:57,360 --> 02:39:00,320
Well, we're gonna go around and start to wrap up the show, we gotta get everybody's final

3271
02:39:00,320 --> 02:39:03,600
thought in order to do that, Dark S- ooh, excuse me, Dark Sakura.

3272
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:04,600
Um, no.

3273
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:06,920
Or, excuse me, Bob.

3274
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:07,920
No.

3275
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:08,920
No?

3276
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:09,920
No final thought?

3277
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:10,920
No, my final thought is no.

3278
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:11,920
No.

3279
02:39:11,920 --> 02:39:14,280
Alright, uh, Loki, your final thought?

3280
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:19,120
Um, I somehow dismissed the show role, but I was gonna mention it real quick, uh, Team

3281
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:24,120
Icos were revealing a new game, The Queen, apparently.

3282
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:25,120
The Queen of what?

3283
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:26,120
England?

3284
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:27,120
It's just called The Queen.

3285
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:28,120
France?

3286
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:33,000
It says, uh, Tokyo Game Show teaser website calls the game, Ico 3, The Queen.

3287
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,640
Alright.

3288
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:37,000
Which begs the question, what was Ico 2?

3289
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Mmm.

3290
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,040
I don't remember an Ico 2.

3291
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:42,040
Maybe Shadow of the Colossus?

3292
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:43,040
I don't know.

3293
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:44,040
He has some people say that.

3294
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:48,840
But, uh, apparently it's gonna be Tokyo Game Show, so that's kind of exciting, um, and

3295
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:55,320
also my final thought is that I got to the bottom of why those rock band drum sets weren't

3296
02:39:55,320 --> 02:39:56,320
out there.

3297
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:59,840
Maybe they released a press release on the 10th, saying that they're coming later in

3298
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:00,840
the week.

3299
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:06,840
I somehow missed that, so that'd be why no one has them yet.

3300
02:40:06,840 --> 02:40:12,520
Um, my final thought for those of you in chat room discussing this game right now is it's

3301
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:15,200
Treasure Hunter.

3302
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:16,200
Not a thief.

3303
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:18,680
Uh, alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's show.

3304
02:40:18,680 --> 02:40:21,520
We're gonna wrap up and, uh, get on out of here.

3305
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:25,440
Um, just let us say thank you very much for tuning into, um, our show and downloading

Remember, if you like what you hear, please tell two other people about our podcast, because

3308
02:40:29,800 --> 02:40:31,240
that's how we, uh, slowly spread the word.

3309
02:40:31,240 --> 02:40:32,500
It's by word of mouth.

3310
02:40:32,500 --> 02:40:35,880
We're not, uh, cool enough or rich enough to have, uh, broadcasting and, uh, really

3311
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:40,520
big corporate website backing us, but that just, uh, lets you guys know that, um, you

3312
02:40:40,520 --> 02:40:42,800
