1
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Could a Wii storage problem solution finally be coming?

2
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:26,670
[SPEAKER_15]: The Mortal Kombat vs DC roster leaks thanks to its achievements, and the first details emerge on DJ Hero.

3
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:35,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there on the internets and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:41,516
[SPEAKER_06]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:46,739
[SPEAKER_06]: It's where every gamer has a voice, including you guys when you join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

6
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:52,641
[SPEAKER_06]: But the voices you'll probably hear most are myself, Rob Roberts, and with me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

8
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:55,262
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers?

9
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:55,762
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here.

10
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,883
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like your new name, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:58,424 --> 00:00:58,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, though.

12
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:04,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't call me Bob Okay, Bob Alright, also joining us tonight You know what, Rob?

13
00:01:05,276 --> 00:01:07,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Returning after being on vacation last week.

14
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:14,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who told him he could take a week off, but apparently he took it upon himself to take a week off after being so exhausted from Penny Arcade Expo.

15
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,660
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Techmaster Loki.

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

17
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,261
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was it?

18
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:18,561
[SPEAKER_06]: The day job kept you away, right?

19
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:20,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I had to go to San Francisco.

20
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you poor thing.

21
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:24,644
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to get bought fancy dinners by the company, I'm sure, huh?

22
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:24,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

23
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:26,525
[SPEAKER_06]: You poor, poor thing.

24
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:28,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Any game-related things you saw?

25
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:31,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you probably can't talk about them even if you did, huh?

26
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:32,367
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't.

27
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,808
[SPEAKER_04]: No, everything there is just like...

28
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:36,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Like company related stuff.

30
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:45,061
[SPEAKER_04]: They, I mean, they mentioned a few like release seats for movies that, you know, it's, I don't know.

31
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:45,642
[SPEAKER_04]: But nothing.

32
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:46,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

33
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:47,424
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no game stuff.

34
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,547
[SPEAKER_04]: They just like, oh yeah, we do games too.

35
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in more

36
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:52,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all movie stuff.

37
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,072
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave everyone a $1,500 trip to one of ten locations.

38
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:00,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's just $1,500.

39
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:06,657
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to book your own trip, so that may cover your flight and that's about it.

40
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:08,958
[SPEAKER_04]: We could go to what, Fresno?

41
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:11,827
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's one of ten locations.

42
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:18,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's either Hawaii, Hollywood, Seattle, somewhere in Arizona, I forget what it was.

43
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you save it for next year and go to Seattle next year?

44
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,010
[SPEAKER_04]: By the end of 2009.

45
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,131
[SPEAKER_04]: And no, I'm not going to PAX next year for that.

46
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:28,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not using it for PAX, no.

47
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:36,235
[SPEAKER_04]: There's San Antonio, Chicago, Boston, New York City, and Orlando.

48
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:37,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Orlando.

49
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:38,976
[SPEAKER_06]: So lots of neat places.

50
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:40,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Hawaii.

51
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:41,037
[SPEAKER_06]: You said Hawaii.

52
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop rubbing it in.

53
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:58,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I found out the other day, because this was originally only being offered to our movie sales, we're going to be probably getting a 42-inch Sony Bravia Plasma TV.

54
00:02:58,289 --> 00:02:58,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

55
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Through some deal.

56
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, our video reps are selling some Sony product, and the goals seem reasonable.

57
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:07,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So probably by Christmas, I'll have another TV.

58
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:08,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me know when they're hiring, okay?

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,623
[SPEAKER_04]: A pillow shaped like a question block from Mario Bros.

60
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:38,325
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have it hanging to my desk just like a question block would be.

61
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:41,847
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't let me hang it from the ceiling, so I had to put it under my shelf.

62
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:45,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, when you get frustrated, would you just go boing?

63
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if I hit it, it knocks it off, but that's fine.

64
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:56,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also brought, because I used to do and collect Gundam figures, they had armored core figures, so I picked up one of those and I'm going to build that.

65
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,180
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool, but lots of game stuff there.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,800
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

67
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:08,818
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

68
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:40,687
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't, because I haven't had a chance to really play much other than Ragnarok.

69
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:46,888
[SPEAKER_13]: But I did open my copy of The World Ends With You, and I'm going to be starting it.

70
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:50,449
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's some progress, right?

71
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:50,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

72
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:54,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes opening the box can be a day-long chore in itself.

73
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,190
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

74
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,370
[SPEAKER_13]: I played Salamander.

75
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, how was that?

76
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I picked up the Salamander pack for Dan on PSP, and it was pretty cool.

77
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:02,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

78
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:04,893
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

79
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Lifeforce was still kind of difficult.

80
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:28,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't say it was our type hard, but it was pretty tough.

81
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:33,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't it have a 30 lives code or something, or at least it had the up, up, down, down, like you could get all the power-ups?

82
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:33,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

83
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:33,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

84
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:35,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that made it easier.

85
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,140
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68 wants to know, was it 1 or 2 Salamander?

86
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,421
[SPEAKER_13]: I got the deluxe pack.

87
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:42,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I played the first one.

88
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:43,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, there you go.

89
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,883
[SPEAKER_13]: The both games packs.

90
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:47,970
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

91
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:06,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

92
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:23,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

93
00:06:52,185 --> 00:07:01,376
[SPEAKER_04]: well it stayed like that and so I was invulnerable and any vehicle I got in I was invincible in as well um until I turned the game off um

94
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they have a nice glitch with one of the little side missions you can do the bet money on to actually make money off of.

95
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:16,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they have a maximum where you can only make 5 million per bet.

96
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:22,269
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem is though is the minimum is calculated off of the amount of money that you have.

97
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And the minimum doesn't have a cap to it.

98
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can keep playing this game until...

99
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,694
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

100
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of boring.

101
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:52,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not too far into it.

102
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:54,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm to the tribe stage right now.

103
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:57,235
[SPEAKER_04]: But I haven't really actually played the tribe stage yet.

104
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:01,337
[SPEAKER_04]: But the cell and creature stages are quite boring.

105
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope the rest of the game is not like that.

106
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,561
[SPEAKER_04]: But so far I'm very unimpressed by the graphics.

107
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very unimpressed by the gameplay.

108
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:14,224
[SPEAKER_04]: It just looks like a game that should have been out like years ago.

109
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:15,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

110
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:16,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

111
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:18,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band 2.

112
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:21,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I was lucky enough to get that a little early.

113
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,471
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been playing quite a bit of Rock Band 2.

114
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:29,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we have a fellow worker.

115
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Mad Catz and Awesome in the same sentence?

116
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:57,250
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

117
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:12,532
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

118
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:38,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

119
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:40,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were like the $20 dance pads.

120
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:41,455
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody was like, yay, cheap dance pad.

121
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:42,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they would break after like a week.

122
00:09:43,276 --> 00:09:45,197
[SPEAKER_06]: They were definitely made with $20 parts.

123
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:47,038
[SPEAKER_04]: At least with the Rock Band stuff.

124
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:50,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that these are officially licensed products.

125
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:57,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mad Catz is in charge of making the cymbals that are going to be optional for Rock Band 2.

126
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,622
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the only people that are making them.

127
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:03,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And this bass is something that they're starting to put out too.

128
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:29,799
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's actually put together a lot better than the controller is the normal guitar controller that you can buy so what makes it kind of unique though they have a thumb rest on it and a dual uh... strummer it's split down the middle so you can kind of um... strum it like you would a bass guitar the only thing i don't like about it and i know you can't really whammy on a bass guitar but the whammy bar is no longer a bar it's a knob and it's literally impossible unless you had a third arm

129
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,559
[SPEAKER_06]: to trigger it.

130
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:36,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to interject here because I want to do a quick poll in our chat room because I'm really, really curious about this before you finish this story.

131
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:44,863
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and this is for the longtime music game fans only, of which I know we have many that listen to Orange Lounge Radio because we've been doing this a while when we all started with DDR.

132
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my quick poll question for chat.

133
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:53,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you find it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz if this bass guitar thing is as awesome as Loki says it is?

134
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:54,505
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my quick poll.

135
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have it in your heart to forgive Mad Catz?

136
00:10:57,186 --> 00:11:07,718
[SPEAKER_13]: I also do have a comment that I don't see what the difference should be in the strum bar or not because I always play the Guitar Hero ones strumming upwards and not downwards because you play bass strumming upwards.

137
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:11,262
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's so that you can hit it faster if you want to.

138
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:12,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like that it's split in two.

139
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:15,226
[SPEAKER_06]: That is kind of cool because you can use like two fingers.

140
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:16,788
[SPEAKER_04]: That would take some getting used to.

141
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:18,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It does take some getting used to.

142
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:21,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it though.

143
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good.

144
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:26,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll read the reviews on it if you have any qualms about buying it.

145
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,841
[SPEAKER_04]: All the reviews have been extremely positive about it.

146
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it is a turn for the better.

147
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,467
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see what else did I play.

148
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, here's the results of our quick poll, alright?

149
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you find it in your heart to forgive MadCatz?

150
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Polled at chat.orangeontrader.com Here we go.

151
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:47,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck no, no, never ever ever, nope, probably, no, hell no, never.

152
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:50,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm waiting for Hori to make a guitar con from GS68.

153
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:55,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, perhaps if the price is right, and that's because it has a better D-pad.

154
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:57,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a MadCatz GameCube controller and it was crap.

155
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:00,089
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, the results of the quick poll.

156
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:01,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

157
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:02,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Resoundingly negative.

158
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd buy a hoary one.

159
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,184
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also supposed to be making later on full wood controllers for...

160
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,951
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

161
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:35,030
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like rockbanddrumsilencer.com or something like that.

162
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,794
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really cheap-ass, you know, foam shit.

163
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:43,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these are the official ones that they actually sell in the stores for $20, and they work pretty good.

164
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:44,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

165
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play drums a little bit, Rob?

166
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:49,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I played drums at your little thing.

167
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:52,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they work pretty good, the sensitivity on them?

168
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:52,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

169
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,550
[SPEAKER_06]: It could have been a little better, honestly.

170
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the pads were better than others.

171
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:00,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed the red one.

172
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:01,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a lot of problems.

173
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:04,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Admittedly, it could be the way I drum.

174
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not used to drumming.

175
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't claim to drum professionally.

176
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:08,897
[SPEAKER_04]: It could also be my drum set because it's a first generation one.

177
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:10,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, all the other ones they've made more sensitive.

178
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

179
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it worked pretty well.

180
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:15,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

181
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:19,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It beats being extremely loud with those because it bugs everybody.

182
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:20,185
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

183
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:23,127
[SPEAKER_06]: The volume is much more manageable with the little

184
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:48,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I was trying to find the Rock Band 2 drum sets which were supposedly out today and apparently nobody knows that they're supposed to be out today so EA just didn't ship anybody because I went to GameStop which I might add, GameStop told me they were coming out today and they said, oh yeah, we have some coming in for our pre-order customers but we don't know how many extras they're going to have and then I come back to a different GameStop and they're all, what are you talking about?

185
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,561
[SPEAKER_04]: They're coming out in October.

186
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:51,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a liar!

187
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:51,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

188
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:54,509
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he was an idiot, is what he was.

189
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:03,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went to the Fry's and they didn't know about it, and Best Buy said they're getting them later in the week, so I'm just assuming they didn't ship anybody, which, not surprising.

190
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:11,983
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I need to get some of those new drums, because I want to plug in useless shit to them.

191
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:16,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And because my drum set will probably go to my sister eventually, so...

192
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:18,568
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

193
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

194
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:22,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, my gaming week.

195
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of a lot of the same things that Matt's been talking about, so I don't want to repeat too bad.

196
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

197
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:26,870
[SPEAKER_04]: One more thing.

198
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

199
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:28,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Castle Crashers.

200
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:29,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking awesome.

201
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:29,991
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

202
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:30,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

203
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:34,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing mostly Spore and Rock Band 2 as well.

204
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:43,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Although most of my Rock Band 2 was early, early this morning because I went to a Walmart, which I usually don't shop at Walmart, but it was the only place that was doing it at midnight, so I was like, alright, I'll go.

205
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:46,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I went into Walmart and, you know, just bought it.

206
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:49,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to wait around because they didn't realize the game was coming out.

207
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:53,339
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever, you know, I guess they're not used to games coming out on Sunday or something.

208
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, as Bobby pointed out... They're not used to working at Walmart at midnight.

209
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:03,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, actually, you know, I was going to try to defend them a little bit, you know, be devil's advocate.

210
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:07,726
[SPEAKER_06]: But you might be right because I was actually told they can't find the box right now because the guy's on break.

211
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:10,898
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

212
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:57,067
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know it's kind of fun to make a sticker and stuff and the online is much more comprehensive you can do these battle of the bands where you're automatically you know playing against your friends list in a Geometry Wars 2 stylish way of taking over their scores and you know on these set lists that could be up for a week or a few hours it's pretty crazy

213
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:15,486
[SPEAKER_06]: so yeah, that's more rounded out online mode but as far as graphics and some of that the interface hasn't really changed at all the models and everything are the exact same ones they had in Rock Band 1 the motion capturing was a lot better though

214
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:18,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't even seem that different to me, to be honest.

215
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:30,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a little bit Rock Band 1.5-ish to me, but then again, this is kind of where we're going with music games, is it's a Madden all its own now.

216
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:38,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I say Rock Band 1.5 in somewhat ingest, because obviously we've been playing DDR for years.

217
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:41,325
[SPEAKER_06]: We're used to this crap, where it's pretty much the same game with new songs.

218
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:42,426
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously though, if...

219
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:49,511
[SPEAKER_04]: The best feature, I think, in this game is actually something that's part of Rock Band 1, which is the song export feature.

220
00:16:50,452 --> 00:17:06,045
[SPEAKER_04]: That, I think, makes it stand out from Guitar Hero easy because now, if it were like DDR, you can take all your songs from the previous mixes and add them in to your next... Rock Band 2, you take all those songs from Rock Band 1.

221
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:07,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band 3 is going to have 2 and 1.

222
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:10,869
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're just going to get this ever-expanding song list and...

223
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's pretty cool.

224
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:14,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I definitely agree.

225
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:15,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's cool.

226
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:25,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's one of the greatest things is just firing up a make-your-own-setlist type thing, and you have literally 150 songs to choose from because you have download songs, rock band one songs, rock band two songs.

227
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,264
[SPEAKER_06]: It's insane, but awesome.

228
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:36,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And then playing a random setlist or playing online when you have to play random songs, you get songs you forgot you had or songs you didn't know you even had to play, so that's kind of cool.

229
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:39,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Other games I've been playing this week.

230
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:40,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Spore, Spore, Spore.

231
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:42,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought Spore and I've been playing that.

232
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

233
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:11,062
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

234
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:34,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving the mouse in random directions, you can get these Picasso-style animals that aren't that bad.

235
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,900
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still feel like I'm crappy at animal design.

236
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,721
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's just something I guess is learned with time.

237
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:41,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I kind of like Loki.

238
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:49,267
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a creature that has like one ginormous eye, like a scorpion, that showed up in my planet that was actually kind of cool looking.

239
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:50,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

240
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:53,529
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be like a dog-looking thing, and the eye was its nose.

241
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was black.

242
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I called it Spike, and it had like a...

243
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:08,485
[SPEAKER_06]: My current creature that's like a carnivore that just eats everything, it looks like a velociraptor, but with a giant mouth.

244
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:13,671
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's like one of those like, hello, my name is George, like type of mouse, like, you know, old.

245
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:18,793
[SPEAKER_04]: PudgeyGuyMouth

246
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:45,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So either I see crappy things my friends made, or I can see the cool-looking Maxis ones.

247
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I should probably do that, because there's been some really stupid things that came in.

248
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:50,407
[SPEAKER_04]: How many penis monsters have you seen in sports?

249
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:50,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero.

250
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:51,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

251
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:53,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero penis monsters.

252
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:54,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't made one, though, myself.

253
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,070
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty impressive.

254
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, can't you, like, report it or something if it happens?

255
00:19:58,891 --> 00:19:59,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

256
00:19:59,411 --> 00:19:59,971
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's the thing.

257
00:20:00,552 --> 00:20:05,974
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to report it, because I was going to make a planet of penis monsters or something, because that'd be funny.

258
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:10,580
[SPEAKER_06]: The one other thing I've been playing, I've been playing World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King.

259
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I got in the beta.

260
00:20:12,822 --> 00:20:18,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really read the user end agreement, so I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say about it, although I'm pretty sure most WoW sites have been talking pretty openly about it.

261
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:20,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to talk about everything about it.

262
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:23,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, what is there to talk about?

263
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:26,115
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been extremely laggy and very hard to kill things.

264
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, ooh, pretty new splash screens.

265
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:29,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh.

266
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:30,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty new graphics.

267
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:31,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on a pretty new continent.

268
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,560
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's about as much as I could see because it was very, very laggy.

269
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,641
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a beta.

270
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:37,121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free for me to play.

271
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't complain nor base a review off it.

272
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:40,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So what can you do?

273
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:41,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I can complain.

274
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:46,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather not complain because I realize it's a beta and it's free and it's not the finished product.

275
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,047
[SPEAKER_06]: But all I can say is that it's hard for me to get a feel for it.

276
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:53,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this though, the new achievement system is kind of interesting.

277
00:20:53,889 --> 00:21:03,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that now you have to have a Blizzard account and I think that's how it's going to tie to Diablo and StarCraft 2 and the other Blizzard franchises.

278
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:09,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And the game does pretty much know with some hit and miss accuracy what achievements you've already unlocked.

279
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:15,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it goes through your quest log and figures out what quests you've already done and therefore what achievements you must have beat.

280
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:17,299
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, my...

281
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

282
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:41,846
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, that's it.

283
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:43,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to drag out Gaming Week too long.

284
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:44,887
[SPEAKER_06]: We're already like 20 minutes into the show.

285
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:46,228
[SPEAKER_06]: We got gaming news to get to.

286
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:50,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll really quickly say for housekeeping tonight, there's not an awful lot to say.

287
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a reminder, I'll be at E4ALL in a couple weeks.

288
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:58,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly, DarkSakura and Loki will not be joining me, but I'll be there hoping to meet some of you in the LA area that are going to come out for E4ALL.

289
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at All Games booth.

290
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:01,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be right out there on the main floor.

291
00:22:01,774 --> 00:22:02,915
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be pretty awesome.

292
00:22:03,595 --> 00:22:05,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they'll say more about that on AllGames.com.

293
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:10,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is the first weekend in October, the 3rd through the 5th, if I'm not mistaken.

294
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:10,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be there.

295
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:11,678
[SPEAKER_06]: in LA.

296
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:18,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if you haven't already, check us out on Twitter at username OLR on Twitter.

297
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:18,624
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a new one.

298
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:22,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, of course, there's always our Live Journal at Orange Lounge, our MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio.

299
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And Facebook, our name is the OL Army.

300
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:28,072
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, four different sites, four different names, just to confuse you further.

301
00:22:28,712 --> 00:22:31,635
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get into the gaming news for tonight.

302
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:32,596
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start off with Loki.

303
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:34,037
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on in gaming news?

304
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:38,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Nintendo has released a new peripheral for the Wii system.

305
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:40,883
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not a hard drive.

306
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:48,610
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a wireless router because I guess they phased out their little USB sticks that they had to use with your PC.

307
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:53,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is its own standalone thing and will allow you to connect...

308
00:22:54,716 --> 00:23:05,382
[SPEAKER_04]: to, it's basically, I guess, like an Ethernet bridge, and will allow you to connect your Wii to your router, to your wired network.

309
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:07,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

310
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:08,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we really need this?

311
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:12,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a replacement for the dongle they had, the USB stick that you had?

312
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, you just said one of my favorite funny words.

313
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:14,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Dongle?

314
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:15,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Dongle.

315
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:18,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to make a spore creature and call it Dongle.

316
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:18,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Dongle.

317
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make one called Balls.

318
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:23,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you do that.

319
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an okay idea, I guess, to have a wireless router.

320
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:54,888
[SPEAKER_04]: or Wireless Bridge for whatever reason because say you know you want to connect your Wii to your wireless network well the problem is for 53 bucks it costs actually 5800 yen or $53 US which is about the equivalent there for 50 some bucks you could probably get yourself a wireless router and then all of your systems can use it oh and it also works with DS as well I don't know

321
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:59,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my thought is, what exactly are you going to take your Wii Online for that badly?

322
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:01,499
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need one of these.

323
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,080
[SPEAKER_06]: To buy more virtual console games, I guess?

324
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:08,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, are there that many games that support, I guess, Brawl and all that?

325
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:13,406
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is just so your Wii can connect to the internet.

326
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:16,228
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically a wireless router.

327
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:21,852
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's Nintendo branded, and it looks like the Wii, sort of.

328
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:22,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

329
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a waste of time, but...

330
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:27,805
[SPEAKER_04]: There's cheaper solutions out there.

331
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Say, for example, this is sitting next to your wired router, your Wii is.

332
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:40,992
[SPEAKER_04]: They have $20 USB wired dongles that you can get to connect straight to it.

333
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:41,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It beats paying $53.

334
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:44,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

335
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:50,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really think this is a problem for a lot of people to connect wirelessly to their network or something.

336
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Just buy a new router.

337
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:55,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Alpha Cananagram in chat says this does allow PCs.

338
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,572
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a router for PCs as well.

339
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:04,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's awesome, but once again, I would rather that you bought just a normal router.

340
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:05,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy a Linksys or something.

341
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:06,399
[SPEAKER_06]: But is it pretty?

342
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:07,880
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the important question.

343
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Linksys are not that pretty white with the blue lights.

344
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:16,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It's white, and they have a little stand that makes it stand up just like the Wii, but it... I mean...

345
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:19,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

346
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:22,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this is going to appeal to the same people that like Max.

347
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty but useless.

348
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:25,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Jamie.

349
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:26,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Dongle.

350
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:31,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

351
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,588
[SPEAKER_04]: This may never come out over here.

352
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:40,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, though, if you are interested in this and you want to get it and you live in Japan, it will be coming out on the 18th.

353
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:52,202
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, moving on to more hardware, possibly, but not a hard drive, according to Reggie Fils-Aimé, who spoke to the Nintendo magazine Club Nintendo.

354
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,866
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Latin American magazine translated.

355
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:56,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Reggie actually said, quote,

356
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:02,553
[SPEAKER_06]: We have never said that it will be a hard drive, nor have we mentioned how we will fix this issue.

357
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,856
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to deliver a better way to store the games.

358
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,010
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

359
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:55,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Why go the elaborate route when you can just go the easy route and make it so that it'll work with USB hard drives or USB flash drives or something like that?

360
00:26:55,541 --> 00:27:05,469
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to try to do something stupid like network storage where they'll just basically store the game on their server and you'll have a key and you'll have to download it every time you want to play it or something like that.

361
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:07,191
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to do something retarded like this.

362
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:07,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it.

363
00:27:09,032 --> 00:27:10,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's my thought is that we too

364
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:15,495
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll release a, you know, just like they've done a DS and a DS Lite, they'll release a Wii 2.

365
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:17,136
[SPEAKER_06]: They should give us a dongle.

366
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,577
[SPEAKER_06]: The increased storage and possibly a dongle attachment.

367
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:28,299
[SPEAKER_13]: They need to have a dongle attachment that links to Bluetooth to a separate hard drive.

368
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.

369
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:37,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they've got... They had some innovative ideas when they first put out the Wii, but all ideas since that haven't been that innovative.

370
00:27:37,662 --> 00:27:39,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually have been kind of a step backwards.

371
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:40,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

372
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:40,503
[SPEAKER_04]: We had...

373
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:43,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, what are we going to do for shooter games?

374
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, let's release a plastic shell.

375
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,007
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to do for driving games?

376
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:49,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, let's release a plastic shell.

377
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:50,450
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to do for storage?

378
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, let's do something stupid.

379
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:55,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what's going to happen.

380
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:59,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just see Reggie at NextE3 coming out to introduce Wii Plus or Wii 2.

381
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this, it's holographic storage.

382
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,381
[SPEAKER_06]: With his increased storage space and his massive dongle.

383
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:06,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this.

384
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:07,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Come with it.

385
00:28:07,623 --> 00:28:07,763
Ah!

386
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:09,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see it now.

387
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,482
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Rob the Robot.

388
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,543
[SPEAKER_04]: He stores your data by stacking blocks or something really retarded.

389
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:15,963
[SPEAKER_13]: He shoves it all in his dongle.

390
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:16,983
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

391
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:17,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about that.

392
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:22,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Wouldn't that be cool if they made a little USB storage device like Rob the Robot?

393
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:23,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't happen.

394
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:30,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I always thought they should release a miniature Rob the Robot that plugs into your DS and Game Boy Advance slot.

395
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:33,467
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

396
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:55,304
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that people are familiar nowadays.

397
00:28:55,664 --> 00:29:00,968
[SPEAKER_04]: People aren't like going, oh, it's a mystical device that connects through the internet via magic.

398
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:03,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people aren't that dumb.

399
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a rudimentary understanding of how computers work.

400
00:29:08,394 --> 00:29:08,714
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

401
00:29:09,135 --> 00:29:15,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, if they don't understand storage and stuff and what kilobytes mean, guess what?

402
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:20,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll learn to figure out what this is via their Wii.

403
00:29:20,303 --> 00:29:21,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's a great idea.

404
00:29:21,504 --> 00:29:23,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, no, we're going to make it.

405
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:27,508
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to pander to the idiots and figure out a way to do that.

406
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:28,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, GS68.

407
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:29,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild, wacky action bike.

408
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:31,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm waiting for that attachment to come out on Wii.

409
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:34,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, man.

410
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:38,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever it's going to be, I'm just ready for disappointment.

411
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,032
[SPEAKER_06]: We need wild, wacky action bike Wii.

412
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,954
[SPEAKER_04]: It would sell like crazy and you know it.

413
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:49,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seriously, whatever they're going to announce at E3 is just going to be a disappointment.

414
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:51,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

415
00:29:53,281 --> 00:29:54,622
[SPEAKER_13]: But we are getting a dongle, right?

416
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:55,982
[SPEAKER_04]: We might.

417
00:29:56,002 --> 00:30:00,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, they're going to be like, we've been working on this for years and it's a Nintendo branded SD card.

418
00:30:01,106 --> 00:30:01,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yourselves.

419
00:30:02,147 --> 00:30:02,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

420
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:06,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see what happens.

421
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:14,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't plan on ending my stupid little boycott just yet because most stuff I want that's been coming out on Wii lately, namely the Strong Bad games, have also been coming out on PC.

422
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:15,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Problem fixed.

423
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:20,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm still going to be downloading Cho Aniki behind my husband's back.

424
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:22,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I like Shaoran's comment.

425
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:23,857
[SPEAKER_06]: A wild, wacky action dongle.

426
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:25,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh!

427
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:26,978
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be like an OLR dream game.

428
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:29,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, I was gifted Cho Aniki this week.

429
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone should gift me.

430
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

431
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:32,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Heart.

432
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:33,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Gift me next.

433
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:38,928
[SPEAKER_06]: GIFs, I can't break my boycott when people give me GIFs.

434
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:40,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to remind you to take the Wii Fit.

435
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:43,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's alright, I'll get it next week or something.

436
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:45,771
[SPEAKER_13]: More news!

437
00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:52,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Mega Man 9, for everyone who has been happy and excited and getting a little bit flickery giddy about it.

438
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,235
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually has a Japanese release date now.

439
00:30:57,663 --> 00:31:02,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Mega Man 9 is supposed to be out in Japan on September 24th for 1,000 Wii Points.

440
00:31:02,924 --> 00:31:09,046
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have our date here yet, or in Europe, but Capcom loves us.

441
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:11,166
[SPEAKER_13]: At least they better, bitches.

442
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:14,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it'll be here soon.

443
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,367
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but seriously, seriously, seriously.

444
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:24,009
[SPEAKER_13]: It was actually reported, I do believe, by Dengeki Online, the release date, so not too bad.

445
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:26,126
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm looking forward to it.

446
00:31:26,507 --> 00:31:29,448
[SPEAKER_13]: I would honestly think that we'd probably get it close to the same day.

447
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:32,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, odds looking good we'll get it around the same day.

448
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.

449
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:34,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Be nice.

450
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

451
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:49,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you can't wait that long, you'll be happy to know that Strong Bad, Episode 2, Strong Baddie of the Free, will be releasing this Monday on WiiWare and on the PC.

452
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:51,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo!

453
00:31:52,674 --> 00:32:00,240
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have no idea what's going to be happening in the game because one, I didn't play the first one and two, I don't really visit the websites.

454
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,003
[SPEAKER_06]: More of the wonderful humor that was in the first game.

455
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:03,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

456
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:04,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It's episode two.

457
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:07,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you watch a TV series, this is episode two.

458
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:11,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you watch a show like South Park and episode one was funny so you tune into episode two.

459
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:11,770
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the whole thing.

460
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And then things get angsty in episode two.

461
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:14,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

462
00:32:16,193 --> 00:32:20,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, characters start sleeping with each other and form these complex relationships.

463
00:32:20,577 --> 00:32:21,458
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I totally made that up.

464
00:32:22,878 --> 00:32:23,939
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would be interesting.

465
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,860
[SPEAKER_13]: I think even watching too much daytime TV, right?

466
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,421
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just 90210.

467
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:28,881
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

468
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:31,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

469
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:33,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

470
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:34,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else is coming out on the Wii quite soon.

471
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:35,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Music.

472
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:39,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we've had certainly mixed opinions on Wii Music.

473
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:45,190
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes I kind of think that Nintendo does these kinds of things just to kind of impress us.

474
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:47,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Like try to get a certain niche audience.

475
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:52,931
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, you are hearing in the background Cowbell in Wii Music.

476
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:56,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Music is actually getting Cowbell.

477
00:32:58,054 --> 00:32:59,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're actually demoing it there.

478
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:01,835
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually check out a little trailer there.

479
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,257
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hit game trailers, but it's also on Nintendo's site.

480
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:11,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So insert your needs more Cowbell joke here because it's probably what got this in the game.

481
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody at Nintendo thought, joke, funny.

482
00:33:15,564 --> 00:33:19,806
[SPEAKER_06]: or that the cowbell is actually considered a real instrument, which in some ways it really is.

483
00:33:20,386 --> 00:33:25,568
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually went to this music store at Haight-Nashbury that has cowbells with features.

484
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,989
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, dude, it's a cowbell.

485
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, this one's got extra muting and this one has tone change and this one's got this.

486
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:35,512
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, dude, it's a cowbell.

487
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:37,893
[SPEAKER_06]: You bang it with a stick.

488
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:39,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, electric cowbell.

489
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:40,554
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.

490
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Amplified Cowbell.

491
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:48,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a cowbell that sounds like a gong every time you hit it.

492
00:33:48,224 --> 00:33:50,045
[SPEAKER_13]: A cowbell doesn't vibrate like that.

493
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:52,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you get to play gong in Wii Music?

494
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:53,567
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be kind of awesome.

495
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:55,989
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I will gong in Wii Music.

496
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:58,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

497
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:01,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Music is getting more cowbell.

498
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,093
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

499
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,149
[SPEAKER_13]: All the others that are already there.

500
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:25,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't that nice?

501
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:28,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wonderful news because Castlevania 3 is one of the best.

502
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:33,630
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing I hope, that it's like the Japanese version.

503
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:38,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I somehow knew you were going to go there and get into the whole discussion about the extra sound or whatever.

504
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,634
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that wasn't it.

505
00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:44,197
[SPEAKER_13]: When you played Grant, you know the one who climbs on the ceiling and everything?

506
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:46,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah, how can you forget Grant if you've ever played Castlevania 3?

507
00:34:46,938 --> 00:34:48,920
[SPEAKER_13]: He throws his knife instead of just stabs.

508
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,861
[SPEAKER_13]: So he actually has a ranged attack.

509
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:52,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so he's actually useful.

510
00:34:52,242 --> 00:34:52,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

511
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:53,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

512
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I always used the one that had the fire, ice.

513
00:34:56,183 --> 00:34:56,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Sypha?

514
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:57,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

515
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:01,345
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's the point in him throwing knives if he can have a sub-weapon of throwing knives?

516
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:03,806
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think he can.

517
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there something else, too, with Castlevania?

518
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's that the Famicom since it had an extra sound.

519
00:35:08,848 --> 00:35:10,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't it have an extra sound processor or something?

520
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:11,309
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it did.

521
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:14,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I think if I'm correct, it ran off the disc.

522
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:22,758
[SPEAKER_13]: and the disc system did actually have... Like, have you ever heard the Legend of Zelda for the Famicom disc?

523
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:25,640
[SPEAKER_13]: It had actually really nice music in it.

524
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,742
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was the difference in the sound processors too.

525
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:33,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Little known fact, the Famicom disc system had a sound channel for porno soundtracks.

526
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:34,308
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

527
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:35,704
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

528
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:36,605
[SPEAKER_04]: False.

529
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:37,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely true.

530
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:38,026
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

531
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:38,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

532
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't lie.

533
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:39,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you would.

534
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:40,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely true.

535
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:45,011
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru in chat says, JP will get JP version, US will get US version.

536
00:35:45,432 --> 00:35:46,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Sad but true.

537
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:57,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if it's easier to not emulate off the disk system, because I don't think there have been any disk games that have come to Virtual Console, maybe JP will get US version.

538
00:35:58,202 --> 00:35:59,483
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's going to be the US version.

539
00:35:59,503 --> 00:36:00,363
[SPEAKER_13]: We got Excitebike, didn't we?

540
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's true, we did.

541
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:07,052
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but Excitebyte wasn't the disc version.

542
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:08,273
[SPEAKER_06]: What did they do with the save load?

543
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:13,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Even here in America, though, remember we got the cartridge and it still had save load and it would just crash your game if you tried to use it?

544
00:36:13,895 --> 00:36:13,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

545
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:19,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I thought was one of the most hilarious things ever on the old school Nintendo, that they just left it in there when we didn't have the attachment.

546
00:36:20,498 --> 00:36:23,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if I was right, the entire game was done in English anyway.

547
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

548
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:33,138
[SPEAKER_04]: If only Nintendo knew they were setting trends with Excitebike that soon will be followed by large companies like EA.

549
00:36:33,798 --> 00:36:35,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Releasing games that are broken.

550
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:37,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

551
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,160
[SPEAKER_13]: DriverMite also had it, if I'm right.

552
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:50,062
[SPEAKER_13]: But no, it didn't because DriverMite was the one that my husband and I went through like 15 copies of when he had his used game store and took out the converter cartridge so that we could make our own converter.

553
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:51,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

554
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:52,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

555
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:56,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, there were actually that many copies of Gyromite in circulation?

556
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:57,524
[SPEAKER_06]: That many Rob the Robot sold?

557
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,640
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend had one.

558
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew one friend that had one.

559
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:01,541
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one.

560
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:03,321
[SPEAKER_06]: What did they really do?

561
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:03,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, nothing.

562
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:04,661
[SPEAKER_06]: They had the little spinny thing.

563
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,261
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a selling point.

564
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:05,741
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

565
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:07,362
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't do anything.

566
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:11,783
[SPEAKER_13]: You can play three games with this thing, and he's going to look cool, and then that's it.

567
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:12,963
[SPEAKER_13]: He looks like Johnny Five.

568
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:16,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a lot of people don't really understand what Rob the Robot actually did.

569
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:26,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, basically, didn't he just, like, he had these little spinning discs that you would put down, like these little top things that you would put down on these giant things that just pressed your controller.

570
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:28,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty much!

571
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, it was a selling point.

572
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:33,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It was amazingly stupid in retrospect.

573
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:41,914
[SPEAKER_06]: And I realize that Rob the Robot is like pop culture cool, and everybody laughed when they saw him in Brawl, but if you think about it, Rob the Robot was really stupid.

574
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, in all actuality.

575
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:46,577
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyhow.

576
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:49,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob the Robot just exudes awesome.

577
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:50,383
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Rob the Robot does.

578
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,552
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

579
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:43,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, anyways, on PC this week, we've got Stalker, Clear Sky, uh, Cabela's Big Game Hunter 09, Legendary Adventures, and, uh, that's also coming out on the PlayStation 2 Wii, and I believe that's it.

580
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see here.

581
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:49,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Wars The Force Unleashed will be coming out on pretty much every system out there.

582
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:55,229

[SPEAKER_04]: Drun Life, Spongebob Squarepants Edition TNA Impact Crisis Warhead on PC

584
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

585
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,881
[SPEAKER_04]: It's meant for lower end PCs.

586
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:27,523
[SPEAKER_04]: The Witcher Enhanced Edition on PC.

587

594
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoo Hospital on the Wii.

595
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:34,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it's like Trauma Center meets a pet hospital.

596
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:36,293
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of neat.

597
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:40,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Bull BC One, that game I've been talking about for a while now.

598
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:41,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out, it's on the DS.

599
00:40:42,837 --> 00:40:48,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see, there's some collections, retro collections coming out from Namco.

600
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:51,262
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the Naruto Ultimate Collection, which is...

601
00:40:52,583 --> 00:41:07,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Naruto The Ultimate Ninja 2 and 3 and Uzumaki Chronicles and then the Namco Classic Fighter Collection which is Soul Calibur 2, Tekken 5 and... God, I can't remember the last one.

602
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:10,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Pac-Man Power Pack which is a bunch of Pac-Man games.

603
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:12,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing good, unfortunately.

604
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:16,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's all the big stuff, at least.

605
00:41:18,513 --> 00:41:18,873
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

606
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:20,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, any price point?

607
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of our listeners are probably into DDRX.

608
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:25,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Any price point for that?

609
00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:28,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it's $40 for the game only, and for the bundle, it's probably $49.99.

610
00:41:29,762 --> 00:41:35,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have thought maybe it came down a little bit in price, because PS2 is kind of, you know, the last... It may have.

611
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:38,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going off memory, and that's, you know...

612
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:40,671
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so don't take that as the final word.

613
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:42,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, give me one second.

614
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:43,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you.

615
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:45,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me do the Japanese release dates, and you can kind of jump in whenever you find it.

616
00:41:46,556 --> 00:41:55,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Going over to the Japanese release dates, Star Wars The Force Unleashed is coming to the Asian regions around Japan and on all those other consoles as well.

617
00:41:55,564 --> 00:42:03,431
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as Japan, Japan itself is getting Unreal Tournament 3 on the Xbox 360 this week on the 18th for those folks that like the first-person shooters over there.

618
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:07,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the scene's not quite as big over there, but they've got some fans of it.

619
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:12,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Some PlayStation 3 games getting a price reduction this week, including Def Jam Icon and Fight Night Round 3.

620
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:17,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, those are price reductions on the PlayStation 3, down to about $30 US.

621
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other games coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 3, G.I.

622
00:42:22,381 --> 00:42:28,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Jockey 4 2008, and Winning Post 7 in a combo pack, or of course you can just get the game G.I.

623
00:42:28,584 --> 00:42:29,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Jockey 4 by itself.

624
00:42:30,244 --> 00:42:38,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Trusty Bell, Chopin No Yume, you might know this here as Eternal Sonata, finally comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

625
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:40,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $29.99 for the game only.

626
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:41,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, much better.

627
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:41,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

628
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:46,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Unreal Tournament 3 also comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week, so be on the lookout for that.

629
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:54,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo Wii, we have Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles getting a price reduction.

630
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:56,277
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that, of course, is Resident Evil.

631
00:42:57,538 --> 00:42:57,838
[SPEAKER_06]: G.I.

632
00:42:57,878 --> 00:42:59,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Jockey Wii 2008 as well.

633
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Kororimpa gets a price reduction.

634
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Bomberman comes out next week, so be on the lookout for that.

635
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,403
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually on next week's list on the 25th.

636
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to the PlayStation 2.

637
00:43:12,068 --> 00:43:13,750
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 2 is still getting a lot of love.

638
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:20,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Hyper Street Fighter 2, the Anniversary Edition, and Vampire Darkstalkers Collection Value Pack.

639
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:27,846
[SPEAKER_06]: So for you old school 2D Capcom fighting fans, a little PS2 pack coming out for you guys.

640
00:43:28,046 --> 00:43:29,028
[SPEAKER_06]: That's happiness.

641
00:43:29,828 --> 00:43:30,129
[SPEAKER_06]: G.I.

642
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:37,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Jockey 4, 2008, also gets a version on PlayStation 2 and gets a combo pack with Winning Post 7, also on PlayStation 2.

643
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:43,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And a game called Heart No Kuni No Alice is coming out as well on the PlayStation 2.

644
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:48,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a look at the handheld systems, starting off on the Nintendo DS.

645
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:53,063
[SPEAKER_06]: DragonBallDS comes out this week from NamcoBandai.

646
00:43:54,185 --> 00:43:56,668
[SPEAKER_06]: LumiSlight, HikariNoPuzzle as well.

647
00:43:57,108 --> 00:44:00,312
[SPEAKER_06]: LongVacation, IrukaTotoWatashi comes out.

648
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:07,601
[SPEAKER_06]: And OshishiKeiji, Keiji-san Watashi ga Arimashita comes out from Success.com.

649
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:12,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see if it will be a success over in Japan.

650
00:44:12,762 --> 00:44:13,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Although probably not.

651
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:14,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never heard of it.

652
00:44:14,703 --> 00:44:20,286
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Sony PlayStation Portable, Monster Hunter Portable, 2ndG Hunter, Leather Cover.

653
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not a game.

654
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:26,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just something to match all the Monster Hunter games that you have for your PlayStation Portable.

655
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:30,791
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you actually want a new game, you can get Samurai Do Portable.

656
00:44:31,448 --> 00:44:32,309
[SPEAKER_06]: is the name of that game.

657
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:36,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure if that's a fighting game or what type of game that is.

658
00:44:36,772 --> 00:44:39,214
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks to be an action-based game.

659
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:40,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a fighting game, though.

660
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a hack-and-slash type PSP game.

661
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:48,102
[SPEAKER_06]: It's rated 15+, or 0C, so you know there's going to be some good blood.

662
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:49,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray!

663
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:49,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Blood!

664
00:44:49,663 --> 00:44:49,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Gore!

665
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:51,765
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for your Japanese release dates.

666
00:44:52,772 --> 00:44:56,495
[SPEAKER_13]: For UK, we have the 18th Warhammer Online.

667
00:44:56,996 --> 00:44:58,397
[SPEAKER_13]: For the 19th is everything else.

668
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:17,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Destroy All Humans, Path of Furon, Hell's Kitchen, the video game, Play TV for PlayStation 3, SimCity Creator, Star Wars The Force Unleashed, also STCC, the game, The Witcher Enhanced Edition, and Tim Stockdale's Riding Star.

669
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:19,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and also Yakuza 2.

670
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:23,258
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it?

671
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:23,778
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

672
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,260
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, The Force Unleashed, we all mentioned that in our respective releases.

673
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,501
[SPEAKER_06]: It's practically a worldwide release this week.

674
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:37,004
[SPEAKER_06]: But one thing that's kind of interesting about it, one thing I was reading about on the internet, I was trying to see if GameStop was doing a Rock Band 2 midnight release.

675
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:40,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I really just didn't want to go to Walmart, but it was pretty much the only thing that was open.

676
00:45:40,545 --> 00:45:41,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, I had to have the game at 12.01.

677
00:45:42,626 --> 00:45:43,747
[SPEAKER_06]: even though I didn't get it until 1230.

678
00:45:44,047 --> 00:45:54,452
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, apparently the reason why GameStop did not do a midnight release for Rock Band 2 is because a lot of them are doing midnight releases for Forced Unleash and they just didn't want to pay all that extra salary.

679
00:45:54,692 --> 00:46:04,357
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people, I mean, I would see why they're doing that because the Forced Unleash is coming out on a lot more systems and a lot of people might not be interested in the game-only version of Rock Band.

680
00:46:04,617 --> 00:46:06,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of rabid Star Wars fans.

681
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:07,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really.

682
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I can understand why they would do that.

683
00:46:12,256 --> 00:46:40,465
[SPEAKER_06]: VXJasonXV played Hell's Kitchen the game in our chat room and he laughs ha ha ha and said I played Fox's Flash version of that it was silly yeah and you know what's funny is that Flash version of it is pretty much what you're getting on the Wii and the DS it's crap so Frisbee says bake that fucking bread now sadly I don't think the Wii version of the game will swear at you which is the only reason to watch Hell's Kitchen I don't get it like if you're not going to get berated by your Nintendo Wii what's the point

684
00:46:41,618 --> 00:46:44,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're just playing like Cake Mania with some fire.

685
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:48,865
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically just like Cooking Mama mixed with American Idol.

686
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:52,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band 2 People that managed to get their copies early were welcomed with custom screens

687
00:47:12,611 --> 00:47:13,612
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

688
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:48,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, for those people that have finally picked up their copy, you'll be greeted with some new tracks to download this Tuesday, including the Megadeth album, Peace Sells, but who's buying?

689
00:47:49,142 --> 00:47:53,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got, it looks like, about, I want to say...

690
00:47:54,613 --> 00:48:11,435
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 songs available there for $2 each or you can buy the whole pack for $11 so you save a few bucks there remember back in the day when like 8 marathon songs was an album like you know you'd get 8 songs from a rock band but they would be just like effing epic rock songs like 7-8 minutes in length

691
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:13,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Megadeth.

692
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:13,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

693
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Megadeth was awesome.

694
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:31,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, if that's not your cup of tea, they have the Rock Band Tour Pack, which includes one of those nights by The Cab, Hands Down by Dashboard Confessional, She's a Handsome Woman by Panic at the Disco, and Natural Disaster by Plain White Teas.

695
00:48:31,822 --> 00:48:36,864
[SPEAKER_04]: All those are available for a buck or 80 Microsoft points, or you can buy the whole pack for $4.

696
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:39,224
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're saving zero money.

697
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:40,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

698
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:47,167
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, speaking of Rock Band download stuff, I know our one and only DarkSakura.

699
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:54,091
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing she loves almost more than video games is gorillas, and therefore Blur, because, you know, the whole Damon-Auburn connection.

700
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:54,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I know!

701
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:58,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I did check out Beetlebum, which is available in the Rock Band store.

702
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,376
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a cover, if you weren't already aware.

703
00:49:00,736 --> 00:49:01,276
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not horrible.

704
00:49:01,297 --> 00:49:02,397
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not worth having.

705
00:49:02,477 --> 00:49:03,258
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not horrible.

706
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:09,302
[SPEAKER_06]: At least you have the song, because, you know, ideally you're supposed to get someone else to sing to it anyway, but it is a cover.

707
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:10,383
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't know on it, already know.

708
00:49:11,496 --> 00:49:17,318
[SPEAKER_13]: If you do sing it, you have to do the really extra thick accent that he affects for the song.

709
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:17,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

710
00:49:18,278 --> 00:49:24,460
[SPEAKER_06]: And I realize this is like the quintessential Blur song, but we have to have song two come out at some point.

711
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

712
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Either that or There's No Other Way.

713
00:49:30,181 --> 00:49:31,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Boys and Girls.

714
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:32,702
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that song.

715
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:33,262
[SPEAKER_13]: My favorite is.

716
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Coffee and TV too.

717
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:36,343
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good song.

718
00:49:36,963 --> 00:49:37,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

719
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:43,393
[SPEAKER_13]: But they probably aren't going to have anything off of the later two Blur albums because they're very kind of melodramatic.

720
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,114
[SPEAKER_06]: At least in this country.

721
00:49:44,134 --> 00:49:46,578
[SPEAKER_06]: This weren't as big here.

722
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:49,482
[SPEAKER_06]: 13 was a weird album.

723
00:49:49,522 --> 00:49:50,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, sorry.

724
00:49:50,564 --> 00:49:51,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough Blur dish.

725
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:54,089
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I love the fact...

726
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:56,170
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

727
00:50:21,132 --> 00:50:26,896
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I thought it was funny that everybody's afraid to go online, like they're going to get busted and banned or something.

728
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:30,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And Harmonix really didn't seem to give a crap.

729
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:37,424
[SPEAKER_04]: We were playing that last night, and some of the vocal sections in the game were kind of easy to hit.

730
00:50:37,444 --> 00:50:38,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember, was it...

731
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:42,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Sabotage, right?

732
00:50:42,046 --> 00:50:53,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sabotage, what you want He was just like He's like drunk That's what he was literally saying He was just kind of yelling He was like, awesome!

733
00:50:53,790 --> 00:51:07,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I thought that was funny And then Irene If you've listened to this show long enough You know Rice Princess was making up new lyrics And saying something about my butt To all these songs Which was very rude, in my opinion Very rude

734
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:13,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, thank God there was no video camera there so it can be on YouTube.

735
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:34,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not only do you already know about the bundle, but now you know exactly what songs you're going to be getting in the game.

736
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:36,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to read the entire song list.

737
00:51:36,713 --> 00:51:39,214
[SPEAKER_06]: You can probably just Google Guitar Hero World Tour song list.

738
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:40,095
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll find the whole thing.

739
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:43,356
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do want to point out some highlights of the song list, at least in my mind.

740
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:44,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure everybody feels differently.

741
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:50,800
[SPEAKER_06]: 311, Beautiful Disaster, Beastie Boys, No Sleep Till Brooklyn, Billy Idol, Rebel Yell,

744
00:52:42,193 --> 00:53:06,294

[SPEAKER_06]: Smashing Pumpkins, Survivor, Eye of the Tiger, Sublime, Tool, 3 Songs by Tool,

746
00:53:26,044 --> 00:53:28,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Tool.

747
00:53:28,366 --> 00:53:31,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Parabola, Schism, and Vicarious.

748
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:32,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Schism.

749
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:33,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't listen to Tool.

750
00:53:33,471 --> 00:53:34,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like them, actually.

751
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,494
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's just... Well, whatever.

752
00:53:38,235 --> 00:53:39,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Van Halen, Hot for Teacher.

753
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:43,700
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a song that got played over and over again at Penny Arcade Expo.

754
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:46,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wings with Band on the Run.

755
00:53:48,004 --> 00:53:49,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know we needed some Wings in Guitar Hero.

756
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:54,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar Hero World Tour Guitar Hero World Tour

757
00:54:02,661 --> 00:54:05,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they would have more songs like Beat It and stuff like that.

758
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:06,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

759
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:09,488
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a pop band or a pop hero or something.

760
00:54:09,508 --> 00:54:11,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even necessarily have to do that, but some download packs.

761
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:17,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why there isn't more Michael Jackson stuff in there because Beat It works and you might even be able to do Thriller and stuff.

762
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:20,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Just stuff that had a lot of guitar and stuff in the background.

763
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:23,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Thriller needs to be download content.

764
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:24,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it happen.

765
00:54:25,422 --> 00:54:26,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Lovely folks.

766
00:54:26,202 --> 00:54:27,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And also country stuff.

767
00:54:28,303 --> 00:54:31,465
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that one song, Rockstar, that would work pretty well.

768
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just surprised there's not a lot of that stuff.

769
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:39,668
[SPEAKER_04]: It may not be enough for its own game, but at least throw some download content out there.

770
00:54:39,688 --> 00:54:45,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure people would appreciate appealing to a broader audience, I guess.

771
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:47,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well there you have it.

772
00:54:47,772 --> 00:54:53,054
[SPEAKER_06]: The Guitar Hero World Tour set list and a lot of guitar fans very excited about this game.

773
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:57,395
[SPEAKER_13]: and other exciting news.

774
00:54:58,736 --> 00:55:00,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I think it's pretty cool.

775
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:03,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, do you ever watch Comedy Central?

776
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:04,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

777
00:55:04,379 --> 00:55:05,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Comedy Central.

778
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,040
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I get South Park.

779
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,841
[SPEAKER_13]: What's your favorite show besides South Park?

780
00:55:08,001 --> 00:55:09,542
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite show besides South Park?

781
00:55:09,702 --> 00:55:10,243
[SPEAKER_06]: The Daily Show.

782
00:55:11,149 --> 00:55:11,750
[SPEAKER_13]: The Colbert Report

783
00:55:27,651 --> 00:55:33,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Charlene is going to be available as a free download for Rock Band.

784
00:55:33,712 --> 00:55:35,733
[SPEAKER_13]: So everyone has to go get it right now.

785
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is actually available now.

786
00:55:37,813 --> 00:55:38,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

787
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:39,914
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's one of those blink and you miss it things.

788
00:55:40,454 --> 00:55:40,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it!

789
00:55:41,074 --> 00:55:43,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because if you go into Rock Band, you won't see it in the new releases.

790
00:55:44,355 --> 00:55:45,475
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only in the library.

791
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:54,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And if anyone wants to familiarize themselves with it, while they already should be, except that I'm not really all that familiar with it, you can actually watch the video on YouTube as well.

792
00:55:57,379 --> 00:55:58,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Go watch it after the show.

793
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:02,845
[SPEAKER_06]: The song's only like a minute long and it's not that difficult either.

794
00:56:02,885 --> 00:56:05,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard people are getting their achievements with it.

795
00:56:07,571 --> 00:56:08,932
[SPEAKER_06]: The lyrics are very funny.

796
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:13,237
[SPEAKER_13]: It enables the players to achieve more.

797
00:56:14,018 --> 00:56:15,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we can play a little clip from Charlene.

798
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:16,982
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only like a minute long.

799
00:56:19,138 --> 00:56:20,699
I love the synthesizer in this song.

800
00:56:43,486 --> 00:56:46,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, nice.

801
00:56:46,087 --> 00:56:46,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Reminds me of my ex.

802
00:56:47,428 --> 00:56:47,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

803
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:50,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, that's so wrong.

804
00:56:50,249 --> 00:56:51,489
[SPEAKER_13]: There you have it.

805
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:52,729
[SPEAKER_13]: That's so wrong.

806
00:56:52,749 --> 00:56:53,450
Oh my god.

807
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,591
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be a couple people listening to the show that understand that.

808
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:58,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on quickly.

809
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:06,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, speaking of appealing to a broader audience, SingStar is releasing a country version which will be coming to the PlayStation 2 on October 28th.

810
00:57:06,935 --> 00:57:07,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can find...

811
00:57:11,738 --> 00:57:22,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess songs from Kelly Pickler, Keith Urban, Montgomery Gentry, and among others.

812
00:57:23,463 --> 00:57:25,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

813
00:57:25,644 --> 00:57:31,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're going to be localizing SingStar Legends as well, which is supposed to be coming out the same day.

814
00:57:32,647 --> 00:57:35,309
[SPEAKER_04]: That has a bunch of pop legend stuff.

815
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:40,111
[SPEAKER_04]: You can probably guess all your favorite stuff.

816
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:41,810
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

817
00:57:57,895 --> 00:57:59,335
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you, Loki?

818
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:08,057
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you talk about SingStar and not talk about the most important announcement of all time?

819
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:15,718
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the greatest moment in video game history happened this week around SingStar, and Loki just somehow missed it.

820
00:58:15,938 --> 00:58:17,939
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a decider who wins the console war, right?

821
00:58:17,999 --> 00:58:23,920
[SPEAKER_06]: The console war has been won this week by Sony PlayStation 3, and it's all because...

822
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:27,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Waterloo

823
00:58:59,626 --> 00:59:02,007
[SPEAKER_06]: This was one of those moments and then God spoke.

824
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:04,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, let there be Abba.

825
00:59:04,568 --> 00:59:05,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was.

826
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:06,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sony won the war.

827
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:07,990
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

828
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:14,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, let's just end the fucking show because there's no other news that's going to top this.

829
00:59:14,773 --> 00:59:15,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that mean we can go home now?

830
00:59:15,834 --> 00:59:18,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we could try, but it's just going to be pathetic.

831
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I don't know.

832
00:59:21,497 --> 00:59:23,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I still think that my story was the best story ever.

833
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:25,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Stephen Colbert is pretty cool.

834
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:26,390
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll try, Rob.

835
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:27,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Try to find something fun.

836
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:28,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I will find something fun.

837
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about DJ Hero.

838
00:59:29,932 --> 00:59:34,654
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people that are very excited about DJ Hero because they think it's going to be Beatmania 2DX.

839
00:59:34,734 --> 00:59:40,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be like, you know, the answer to Beatmania 2DX by the folks who did Guitar Hero.

840
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:46,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you'd be kind of like half right because it's not really going to be like...

841
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:47,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Beatmania 2DX

842
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:12,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you imagine one of these things, you could hit this little turntable and there's actually going to be little effector buttons on it.

843
01:00:13,034 --> 01:00:15,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a version of one of those type of decks.

844
01:00:15,116 --> 01:00:19,441
[SPEAKER_06]: You use these little effector buttons and a crossfader to actually drop samples.

845
01:00:19,841 --> 01:00:26,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you ever thought like, hey, Beatmania isn't really like DJing, now you have a game that is actually kind of DJing.

846
01:00:27,048 --> 01:00:28,469
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

847
01:00:52,328 --> 01:00:52,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

848
01:00:53,309 --> 01:01:01,815
[SPEAKER_04]: If we take the scratch and replace it with strum and we turn the effector buttons into fret buttons, we have Guitar Hero.

849
01:01:02,455 --> 01:01:06,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, it's just re-skinning Guitar Hero to put different music in it.

850
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:07,519
[SPEAKER_06]: But in a way, think about this.

851
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,299
[SPEAKER_06]: This does sound kind of cool.

852
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,022
[SPEAKER_06]: They say the wireless controller apparently is actually grooved to fit in your lap.

853
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:12,982
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

854
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,129
[SPEAKER_13]: The Grey Album was Jay-Z and the Beatles.

855
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:38,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, never mind.

856
01:01:38,689 --> 01:01:39,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Jay-Z.

857
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:40,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm thinking Metallica's Black Album.

858
01:01:40,891 --> 01:01:42,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was like a black album mixed with a white album.

859
01:01:43,973 --> 01:01:46,395
[SPEAKER_06]: But think those types of things.

860
01:01:46,455 --> 01:01:48,997
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be mashups.

861
01:01:49,017 --> 01:01:50,097
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be the whole song list.

862
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:51,398
[SPEAKER_06]: You like mashups, don't you, Loki?

863
01:01:51,819 --> 01:01:52,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you loved that kind of stuff.

864
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:53,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

865
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this game is going to be... People will probably buy it because it's...

866
01:01:57,623 --> 01:02:06,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something that Activision is putting out, but I think it's going to be, if you're thinking it's going to be 2DX, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

867
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:07,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see what happens.

868
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,512
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not going to be 2DX, but it sounds like it could be cool.

869
01:02:11,653 --> 01:02:15,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't necessarily need a copy of a game that's already out there and still selling in Japan, you know what I mean?

870
01:02:16,596 --> 01:02:18,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the fact that it's kind of different.

871
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:48,348
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're also saying that they're supposed to be like guitar co-op as well I don't know it's we'll have to see how it actually plays out but I'm not too optimistic yet what's interesting and possibly related is that almost within the same breath Activision announced this week that they have acquired Freestyle Games it's a UK based developer and they made the game B-Boy which you know was on the PSP I don't think it really sold like crazy but it was a rhythm action game that was available on the PSP and it's apparently what they're doing is they're developing a new music based IP

872
01:02:49,363 --> 01:02:50,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

873
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:51,904
[SPEAKER_06]: B-Boy?

874
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:54,025
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Hero?

875
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:55,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Connection?

876
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:56,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

877
01:02:56,926 --> 01:03:02,528
[SPEAKER_06]: But it certainly is interesting that Freestyle Games was sucked into the Activision collective this week.

878
01:03:02,888 --> 01:03:03,368
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

879
01:03:03,809 --> 01:03:05,249
[SPEAKER_04]: People will eat this up.

880
01:03:06,189 --> 01:03:18,094
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you do something innovative with it, you know, if you can mix actual MP3s or something like that, that might be kind of cool, but somehow I'm gonna set the bar a lot lower than, you know,

881
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:19,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like it to be.

882
01:03:19,978 --> 01:03:22,680
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, B-Boy was not just available on the PlayStation Portable.

883
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It is available on the PlayStation 2, also in the United States.

884
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:26,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it got released here a couple weeks ago.

885
01:03:27,264 --> 01:03:29,886
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was probably one of those, again, kind of blink and you miss it sort of things.

886
01:03:29,926 --> 01:03:30,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an alright game.

887
01:03:31,066 --> 01:03:31,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

888
01:03:31,527 --> 01:03:32,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it.

889
01:03:32,027 --> 01:03:32,628
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

890
01:03:32,788 --> 01:03:33,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I had never even heard of it.

891
01:03:33,588 --> 01:03:34,809
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I say blink and miss it.

892
01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:39,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the UK version of the PSP game a while back, and it was alright.

893
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:42,195
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a lot to hold my attention for a long time, but it was pretty cool.

894
01:03:42,795 --> 01:03:43,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, fair enough.

895
01:03:44,795 --> 01:03:45,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, there you have it.

896
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,798
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see more information on DJ Hero.

897
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:48,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe made by these guys.

898
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:49,239
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

899
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Sony is not happy.

900
01:03:53,303 --> 01:03:54,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Not happy at all.

901
01:03:54,924 --> 01:03:55,685
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be elated.

902
01:03:55,725 --> 01:03:56,286
[SPEAKER_06]: They have ABBA.

903
01:03:57,006 --> 01:03:59,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but the PSP people aren't happy.

904
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:01,410
[SPEAKER_13]: They want it all.

905
01:04:01,611 --> 01:04:04,513
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, as if ABBA wasn't big enough, they want everything.

906
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:06,575
[SPEAKER_13]: They want third-party support for the PSP.

907
01:04:07,336 --> 01:04:08,577
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not very happy with it.

908
01:04:10,271 --> 01:04:28,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, the boss of Sony Worldwide Studios, Yoshida Shuhei, is basically saying that they'd like to see more third-party support on the PSP and that they're jealous because other people are getting third-party support and not them.

909
01:04:29,344 --> 01:04:31,525
[SPEAKER_13]: He's quoted saying it's really, really disappointing.

910
01:04:31,725 --> 01:04:33,847
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's so disappointing he had to use really twice.

911
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:35,308
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

912
01:04:36,148 --> 01:04:37,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It did get the point across.

913
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:58,624
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's a lost opportunity for the third parties they should look at what the PSP can do for their titles and the potential for the business that their IP has they say though that Sony's got a whole bunch more things ready but they are really wanting Capcom maybe but you know the PSP 3000

914
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:01,165
[SPEAKER_13]: is on its way!

915
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even that.

916
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:22,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't even go that far.

917
01:05:22,623 --> 01:05:31,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just there's a lot more people that own the DS because they're suckered into buying multiple colors for it or God knows what.

918
01:05:32,421 --> 01:05:41,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I like the PSP a lot better than the DS, but I... Well, but if you go back to that rule that a system is only as good as the games that are on it... Exactly, there's better games on DS in general, so people are going to go where the good games are.

919
01:05:42,084 --> 01:05:47,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And in a way, this is what Sony's complaining about, is that the third parties aren't giving them what they need to sustain.

920
01:05:47,746 --> 01:05:50,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe start supporting the third parties a little bit more.

921
01:05:50,227 --> 01:05:55,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe do some innovative features to the PSP, like make voice chat a lot easier.

922
01:05:55,889 --> 01:05:58,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that they have the microphone built in, they can do some stuff with that.

923
01:05:59,517 --> 01:06:01,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Touchscreen, that might be kind of cool.

924
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:02,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Tilt sensors.

925
01:06:04,939 --> 01:06:10,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I always kind of thought that the PSP's strength over the DS was that it was more of a kind of all-in-one type system.

926
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like part iPod, part game player, part web browser.

927
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:16,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a little bit of everything for a relatively low price.

928
01:06:16,482 --> 01:06:21,384
[SPEAKER_13]: For me, I have absolutely no reason to really play a PSP much except for a couple of games, really.

929
01:06:22,085 --> 01:06:25,626
[SPEAKER_06]: If I was in high school, though, all over again, I would be all over this PSP.

930
01:06:25,926 --> 01:06:28,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this would be a great thing to take to high school, I think.

931
01:06:28,147 --> 01:06:29,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you got it all right there.

932
01:06:30,307 --> 01:06:32,408
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was in high school, it was the Atari Lynx.

933
01:06:33,888 --> 01:06:34,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, if that.

934
01:06:34,988 --> 01:06:35,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have one of those.

935
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:37,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a Game Boy Brick.

936
01:06:37,229 --> 01:06:38,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, it was the Turbo Express.

937
01:06:38,949 --> 01:06:42,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a Game Boy Brick in a brick gray case.

938
01:06:43,451 --> 01:06:44,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I hauled it around and it got stolen.

939
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:48,992
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a Game Boy Brick and a friend of mine had a Turbo Express.

940
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:51,631
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, cool, I want one.

941
01:06:52,111 --> 01:06:52,431
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway.

942
01:06:54,312 --> 01:07:06,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's some other good things, though, coming to the PSP, and I know we don't talk about it too much, but they actually have a lot of games now on their PC store that you can download the full versions of.

943
01:07:06,718 --> 01:07:10,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like a digital version of it, kind of like what they do with the PS1 Classics.

944
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Included, you know, this new lineup of stuff.

945
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:15,221
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have Cube...

946
01:07:16,942 --> 01:07:20,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Quest Challenge of the Warlords for $14.99, which is not bad.

947
01:07:20,563 --> 01:07:21,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Work Time Fun for $10.

948
01:07:21,643 --> 01:07:27,604
[SPEAKER_04]: You get PQ, PQ2, that one game that's kind of like IQ.

949
01:07:28,064 --> 01:07:34,565
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one for $9.99, the second one for $14.99, and Deadhead Fred, which is kind of a sleeper game for $15.

950
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:39,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are releasing quite a bit of stuff on the PC store.

951
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:44,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think it's funny, though, that they have digital copies of it now, because, I mean...

952
01:07:45,865 --> 01:07:49,393
[SPEAKER_04]: People have been doing that before in not such a legit way.

953
01:07:50,255 --> 01:07:51,096
[SPEAKER_04]: But now they're encouraging it.

954
01:07:52,421 --> 01:08:09,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, if you're listening to this show on a PSP, which a lot of our emailers and so on have told us that they do, you need to pause the podcast right now and you need to go to olrpsp.com in your browser and check out the new Orange Lounge Radio All Games Tuner that's available on the downloads page there because it's quite awesome.

955
01:08:09,573 --> 01:08:15,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will allow you to listen to the All Games Radio live feed right there from your crossbar without having to hunt around for it.

956
01:08:15,897 --> 01:08:17,959
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like one-click access to the show, which is great.

957
01:08:18,379 --> 01:08:19,340
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

958
01:08:38,516 --> 01:08:39,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, interesting.

959
01:08:39,397 --> 01:08:39,737
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

960
01:08:40,998 --> 01:08:42,439
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see.

961
01:08:43,059 --> 01:08:45,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to another Sony-related story.

962
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,263
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the type of game a lot of folks can get into.

963
01:08:48,343 --> 01:08:49,224
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Kingdom Hearts.

964
01:08:49,664 --> 01:08:53,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people have kind of been wondering, when's the next Kingdom Hearts game going to come out?

965
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:55,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's our information on Kingdom Hearts 3?

966
01:08:55,428 --> 01:08:56,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, sadly, we don't have that.

967
01:08:57,089 --> 01:09:02,731
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we did get from this week's GameStop Expo, which is kind of a meeting of all the important people at GameStop, happened this week.

968
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:06,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, a little piece slipped out about Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.

969
01:09:07,112 --> 01:09:14,975
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember that this was a Game Boy Advance game that got released on the PlayStation 2 in Japan as part of a Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix type thing that came out.

970
01:09:14,995 --> 01:09:18,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a bonus disc, and it kind of was forgotten about and never was released over here.

971
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:25,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Until now, apparently, Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, it is going to be coming to the U.S.,

972
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:30,379
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a small mention of Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories at Square Enix's presentation.

973
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:36,061
[SPEAKER_06]: When they were asked if it was the same one that was Final Mix 2 in Japan, they did confirm it with a nod.

974
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:40,142
[SPEAKER_06]: There hasn't been an official announcement through Square, just this small mention.

975
01:09:40,202 --> 01:09:42,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess you should take it with a little bit of a grain of salt.

976
01:09:43,303 --> 01:09:48,245
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently, if you tie things together, back in July, Squeenix was hiring an English voice cast.

977
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:50,826
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably to go for this game.

978
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:54,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Although that could also be for Final Fantasy 13, but who knows.

979
01:09:56,519 --> 01:09:58,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think, why not release this game here?

980
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:00,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, certainly there's an audience for it.

981
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:05,712
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, they usually don't pay attention to everybody, do they?

982
01:10:06,273 --> 01:10:07,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, who knows?

983
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:09,791
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

984
01:10:37,918 --> 01:10:40,659
[SPEAKER_13]: The classic game of the week came out on Super Nintendo.

985
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:45,360
[SPEAKER_13]: It is one of the Mario franchises, and it is Mario Paint.

986
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:47,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

987
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:56,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Mario Paint uses the SNES mouse that came with it, and it basically is a little drawing program for the most part.

988
01:10:56,442 --> 01:11:06,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it basically is like Microsoft Paint, but I don't really want to go too much into the more...

989
01:11:09,088 --> 01:11:10,489
[SPEAKER_13]: in a structured part of the game.

990
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:12,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go into what's playing in the background.

991
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:18,534
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a little clip from F-Zero that somebody has put into the little music maker in Mario Paint.

992
01:11:20,782 --> 01:11:21,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, right.

993
01:11:21,962 --> 01:11:36,407
[SPEAKER_13]: It did actually have a music program in there, and you could actually save things onto... I do believe that you could actually tape them, but it was very weird.

994
01:11:36,427 --> 01:11:39,108
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of these are more... These days are done through an emulator now.

995
01:11:39,768 --> 01:11:49,992
[SPEAKER_13]: But there was... Going back to the art side of it, you could actually make stamps, and it came with stamps in it, too, and that was cool.

996
01:11:51,253 --> 01:12:12,289
[SPEAKER_13]: 30 different colors, 60 different textures and patterns, 75 different stamps, 15 customizable stamps, battery backup, and special erasers like the fade erase, water erase, where the picture becomes a grayscale and vanishes, timed erase, rain erase, split image erase, pixelated erase, blinds erase, rocket erase, and abrupt erase.

997
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:13,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just imagining.

998
01:12:14,351 --> 01:12:18,034
[SPEAKER_13]: But here in the background... Turn it up a little bit.

999
01:12:20,963 --> 01:12:21,954
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Dragon Force.

1000
01:12:27,361 --> 01:12:28,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this cheated a little bit though.

1001
01:12:28,842 --> 01:12:32,164
[SPEAKER_06]: This is using one of those external Mario Paint emulator things.

1002
01:12:32,184 --> 01:12:32,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but still.

1003
01:12:33,005 --> 01:12:33,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, same idea.

1004
01:12:34,186 --> 01:12:34,446
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

1005
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:37,348
[SPEAKER_13]: I included basically a lot of those just because I thought they were fun.

1006
01:12:38,128 --> 01:12:45,553
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, there were the mini games called... A fly swatting game called Coffee Break or Nat Attack.

1007
01:12:46,474 --> 01:12:52,658
[SPEAKER_13]: And you played as the Glove Hand, which as we all know was the boss in the Smash Bros.

1008
01:12:52,698 --> 01:12:53,258
[SPEAKER_13]: games, right?

1009
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:53,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1010
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:56,649
[SPEAKER_13]: and it holds fly swatter and it has to swat things.

1011
01:12:57,734 --> 01:12:58,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Nat Attack.

1012
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:11,984
[SPEAKER_13]: There was also a little mini-game on the title screen where you could click the letters to have a certain sequence of actions go on.

1013
01:13:12,604 --> 01:13:14,065
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you could change the music.

1014
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:16,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd have Yoshi show up and paint the background.

1015
01:13:17,566 --> 01:13:23,868
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, this is a game that has a particular... Yeah, I put Power Rangers on there too because it's funny.

1016
01:13:25,629 --> 01:13:30,210
[SPEAKER_13]: But have you ever heard of a Totoka song, Rob?

1017
01:13:32,234 --> 01:13:32,394
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1018
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:37,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Kazumi Totoka was the guy who did a lot of Nintendo music.

1019
01:13:37,656 --> 01:13:44,259
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a song that is basically his little 19-note song that shows up in all the games he does stuff on.

1020
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:45,119
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little Easter egg.

1021
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:48,300
[SPEAKER_13]: And it shows up... Oh, I have heard of that.

1022
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I have heard of that, yes.

1023
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,642
[SPEAKER_13]: But for anyone who doesn't know, on Animal Crossing, it actually was K.K.'

1024
01:13:52,622 --> 01:13:53,002
[SPEAKER_13]: 's song.

1025
01:13:54,082 --> 01:13:54,822
[SPEAKER_13]: In Animal Crossing.

1026
01:13:55,503 --> 01:13:58,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So, that's when it... It was actually...

1027
01:13:59,504 --> 01:13:59,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

1028
01:13:59,904 --> 01:14:00,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

1029
01:14:27,282 --> 01:14:33,467
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the song, um, uh, Airman, uh, La, Taos and I, I think, yeah.

1030
01:14:33,527 --> 01:14:36,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to point out, this one is done in a legitimate Mario Paint.

1031
01:14:36,349 --> 01:14:37,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that one was.

1032
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:39,371
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thought it was very well done.

1033
01:14:40,852 --> 01:14:46,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but anyway, um, the first episode of Homestar Runner was animated in Mario Paint.

1034
01:14:47,497 --> 01:14:48,298
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so awesome.

1035
01:14:49,329 --> 01:14:50,270
[SPEAKER_13]: There have been sequels.

1036
01:14:50,990 --> 01:15:15,712
[SPEAKER_13]: There was one on the Nintendo 64DD called Mario Artist, which was a launch title, and it brought out the mouse for the Nintendo 64, and it was to make 3D polygonal models, and you could actually insert images onto these 3D models using the Nintendo 64 capture cartridge, and then share your work with the communication kit online.

1037
01:15:17,052 --> 01:15:23,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Although we didn't, of course, get that over here, but Mario Paint did have a sort of appearance in WarioWare Touched as WarioPaint.

1038
01:15:24,576 --> 01:15:24,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1039
01:15:24,956 --> 01:15:27,917
[SPEAKER_13]: And you had the turntable and the toy room and all that.

1040
01:15:27,937 --> 01:15:32,319
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Fly Splitting game was in WarioWare Mega Micro Games.

1041
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:37,002
[SPEAKER_13]: And Wii Photo Channel has an editing system that's similar to Mario Paint.

1042
01:15:37,802 --> 01:15:44,245
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, like we were mentioning before, there have been standalone applications of the music program.

1043
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:47,076
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had to put that one on there.

1044
01:15:49,998 --> 01:15:52,200
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been paint rolled.

1045
01:15:54,222 --> 01:15:55,823
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the game is Mario Paint.

1046
01:15:57,324 --> 01:15:58,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It is your classic game of the week.

1047
01:15:58,846 --> 01:15:59,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Paint!

1048
01:16:00,027 --> 01:16:01,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Available on the Super Nintendo.

1049
01:16:02,409 --> 01:16:05,191
[SPEAKER_06]: With yet another one of Nintendo's famous peripherals.

1050
01:16:05,591 --> 01:16:05,952
[SPEAKER_06]: The mouse.

1051
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:08,374
[SPEAKER_13]: It was only on one game.

1052
01:16:08,914 --> 01:16:11,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say there was one other game that you could use it with.

1053
01:16:11,877 --> 01:16:13,178
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you could also use it on the gun games.

1054
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:14,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

1055
01:16:14,743 --> 01:16:18,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say, couldn't you use it on, was it Lemmings you could use it on?

1056
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:19,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Lemmings, Lemmings you could.

1057
01:16:19,632 --> 01:16:20,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Lemmings was one.

1058
01:16:20,233 --> 01:16:23,899
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, I think I remember that actually being sort of a feature of it, wasn't it?

1059
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:24,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

1060
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:26,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Lemmings kind of irritated me, though.

1061
01:16:28,905 --> 01:16:29,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's it.

1062
01:16:29,505 --> 01:16:29,986
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1063
01:16:30,006 --> 01:16:30,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic Game of the Week.

1064
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:33,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of our show tonight.

1065
01:16:33,808 --> 01:16:34,948
[SPEAKER_06]: But stay tuned.

1066
01:16:35,028 --> 01:16:36,029
[SPEAKER_06]: There's plenty more to come.

1067
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:37,029
[SPEAKER_06]: We're only halfway there.

1068
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:49,556
[SPEAKER_06]: In Part B tonight, your phone calls and more news, including some updates on Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, Batman Arkham Asylum, and some news about Capcom, and some more Xbox bundles coming soon.

1069
01:16:49,936 --> 01:16:54,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1070
01:17:01,754 --> 01:17:08,716
[SPEAKER_17]: So you've got a bunch of websites and podcasts about anime, manga, or video games, but you just don't have the time to read and listen to them all.

1071
01:17:09,276 --> 01:17:12,617
[SPEAKER_17]: When are you actually going to find the time to play games or watch anime?

1072
01:17:15,577 --> 01:17:16,918
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why there's Anigamers.

1073
01:17:17,298 --> 01:17:23,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only are we a comprehensive anime, manga, and video game blog with news and reviews, but we've also got a podcast.

1074
01:17:23,789 --> 01:17:27,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Tune in to hear our insightful conversation about your favorite geeky topics.

1075
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:32,954
[SPEAKER_00]: We do news, reviews, con reports, debates, and even recorded convention panels.

1076
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:37,616
[SPEAKER_16]: Plus, you can expect something different from the Antigamers podcast every time.

1077
01:17:37,896 --> 01:17:43,619
[SPEAKER_18]: That's because we always bring in new co-hosts, including our own staff, other podcasters, and industry insiders.

1078
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:51,704
[SPEAKER_00]: To subscribe, visit www.annagamers.com or search for us in the iTunes Store.

1079
01:17:52,064 --> 01:17:53,365
[SPEAKER_02]: The Annie Gamers Podcast.

1080
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:56,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we all need another anime and gaming podcast.

1081
01:17:57,727 --> 01:17:57,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1082
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:03,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here.

1083
01:18:04,019 --> 01:18:08,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Recently, I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on Xbox Live.

1084
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:10,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, stop spewing hate speech on Xbox Live.

1085
01:18:10,522 --> 01:18:16,025
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make you look cool, it won't get you any friends, and at the end of the day, you still have an incredibly small penis.

1086
01:18:38,815 --> 01:18:53,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1087
01:18:53,764 --> 01:18:56,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a little old school bumper bringing us back there.

1088
01:18:56,385 --> 01:18:57,086
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my Wii.

1089
01:18:57,326 --> 01:18:59,988
[SPEAKER_06]: That is like a million different people yelling out acronyms.

1090
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't know what they mean to this day.

1091
01:19:01,568 --> 01:19:03,489
[SPEAKER_13]: That was Megumi doing GGPO.

1092
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:04,570
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that even mean?

1093
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:05,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Good game, peace out.

1094
01:19:05,751 --> 01:19:06,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1095
01:19:06,571 --> 01:19:07,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

1096
01:19:07,572 --> 01:19:07,792
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1097
01:19:08,459 --> 01:19:08,839
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1098
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:12,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so yeah, those are our friends in StepSquad.

1099
01:19:12,983 --> 01:19:14,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there still a StepSquad that plays DDR?

1100
01:19:15,285 --> 01:19:17,106
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure StepSquad is still around.

1101
01:19:17,647 --> 01:19:23,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, honestly, the last time I saw Jahi, every time I ever see him is like randomly in Japantown.

1102
01:19:23,912 --> 01:19:25,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Like when I'm not even trying.

1103
01:19:25,934 --> 01:19:28,436
[SPEAKER_13]: And I ran into Wendell at Faname last year.

1104
01:19:28,456 --> 01:19:30,938
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen him a few times recently.

1105
01:19:31,358 --> 01:19:32,439
[SPEAKER_13]: And once at YaoiCon.

1106
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:33,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1107
01:19:34,121 --> 01:19:36,743
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he was working security or something.

1108
01:19:37,717 --> 01:19:39,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, very cool.

1109
01:19:41,159 --> 01:19:46,702
[SPEAKER_06]: VXJ6V's in chat and says, I asked that four years ago when I was on the show and I guess I forgot what GGPL means.

1110
01:19:46,802 --> 01:19:47,363
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

1111
01:19:47,723 --> 01:19:47,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1112
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:48,663
[SPEAKER_06]: What, Loki?

1113
01:19:48,783 --> 01:19:53,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we started the second half here, I wanted to mention something I mentioned to you yesterday.

1114
01:19:54,006 --> 01:19:54,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

1115
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:07,606
[SPEAKER_04]: We all got 14-day trials to World of Warcraft from PAX, and my wife wants to try Warcraft.

1116
01:20:08,247 --> 01:20:11,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, the rapture is coming.

1117
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:13,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Start praying.

1118
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:15,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, is she really going to do it?

1119
01:20:15,672 --> 01:20:16,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she is.

1120
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:21,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, she hates games, but she's going to start playing WoW.

1121
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:23,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, she's going to try the 14-day trial.

1122
01:20:23,998 --> 01:20:25,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, amazing.

1123
01:20:27,433 --> 01:20:30,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun a little bit for emails.

1124
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,283
[SPEAKER_13]: We got one from Sakura Max.

1125
01:20:33,065 --> 01:20:34,087
[SPEAKER_13]: This is from my cell phone.

1126
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:35,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I survived the hurricane.

1127
01:20:35,149 --> 01:20:35,810
[SPEAKER_13]: No electricity.

1128
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:37,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Minimal damage to my house.

1129
01:20:37,213 --> 01:20:37,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1130
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:39,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you for reminding.

1131
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:46,815
[SPEAKER_06]: There was that horrible hurricane that happened, and we hope any listener who is potentially impacted by that is doing okay.

1132
01:20:47,435 --> 01:20:52,237
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I hear, it's a lot of really, really bad damage, but I don't know.

1133
01:20:52,277 --> 01:20:58,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time I checked, I hope I don't make an ass of myself, but last time I checked, it didn't sound like the fatalities were nearly as bad as the last time we had a major hurricane in this country.

1134
01:20:58,878 --> 01:21:00,659
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that's progress.

1135
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:01,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1136
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:03,300
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1137
01:21:26,997 --> 01:21:32,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And to respond to the chatroom, I'm not necessarily encouraging her to play.

1138
01:21:32,299 --> 01:21:36,481
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something she wants to try because everyone keeps talking about it.

1139
01:21:37,302 --> 01:21:38,062
[SPEAKER_04]: She feels left out.

1140
01:21:39,202 --> 01:21:40,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I would start playing.

1141
01:21:42,304 --> 01:21:43,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I want to.

1142
01:21:44,465 --> 01:21:46,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharan in chat has a very strong opinion.

1143
01:21:46,225 --> 01:21:51,268
[SPEAKER_06]: If Loki wants to help Nelly with World of Warcraft, he should just get her a real RPG instead.

1144
01:21:51,308 --> 01:21:51,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, burn.

1145
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:54,503
[SPEAKER_06]: She doesn't have the patience for that stuff.

1146
01:21:55,446 --> 01:21:59,660
[SPEAKER_13]: For the record, I actually, I'm not going back in the chat room because I keep getting dropped.

1147
01:22:01,328 --> 01:22:03,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're having some network problems here in studio.

1148
01:22:03,871 --> 01:22:04,571
[SPEAKER_13]: It's annoying!

1149
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:10,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Just another night here at OLR, so I guess maybe somebody will be buying me a new router soon, I don't know.

1150
01:22:10,837 --> 01:22:12,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

1151
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:16,402
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into some gaming news tonight here at Orange Launch Radio, some more.

1152
01:22:17,343 --> 01:22:21,587
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't even talked at all really about Xbox 360 news, and I think that's where we're going to start tonight, right Loki?

1153
01:22:21,607 --> 01:22:22,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1154
01:22:22,728 --> 01:22:26,171
[SPEAKER_04]: There was of course some rumors coming out of PAX about a possible new...

1155
01:22:27,432 --> 01:22:29,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo game coming out.

1156
01:22:29,474 --> 01:22:34,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Then people realize, oh, it's just the map pack and there was new achievements that got leaked out and all that fun stuff.

1157
01:22:35,318 --> 01:22:43,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, those new achievements have been confirmed as actual achievements that will be coming to Halo 3 and they're coming to Halo 3 later this month.

1158
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:52,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can expect for, I guess, I don't know how many new points they're going to add to it, but a whole bunch of new achievements.

1159
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:55,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they'll come out with a new map pack.

1160
01:22:55,153 --> 01:22:56,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'd be kind of neat.

1161
01:22:58,066 --> 01:22:59,867
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's part of their title update too.

1162
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:02,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hooray for them doing a big update.

1163
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:03,450
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be free?

1164
01:23:04,211 --> 01:23:04,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1165
01:23:04,371 --> 01:23:04,631
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope.

1166
01:23:04,971 --> 01:23:05,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1167
01:23:05,532 --> 01:23:06,392
[SPEAKER_04]: The update will be free.

1168
01:23:06,473 --> 01:23:09,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So the new achievements will probably be free, but map pack, probably not.

1169
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:16,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, and not to discourage people buying it, but remember all those other map packs that they had out there?

1170
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:19,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, those eventually become free anyway, so... Dope.

1171
01:23:19,823 --> 01:23:20,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a rental.

1172
01:23:23,326 --> 01:23:23,666
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1173
01:23:24,286 --> 01:23:24,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1174
01:23:43,181 --> 01:23:47,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Big Dumb Fun has been ruined this week thanks to a leaked list of achievements.

1175
01:23:48,443 --> 01:23:51,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox360achievements.org, hey, you know what?

1176
01:23:51,224 --> 01:23:52,324
[SPEAKER_06]: They were just doing their job.

1177
01:23:52,364 --> 01:23:52,924
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they do.

1178
01:23:53,004 --> 01:23:54,905
[SPEAKER_06]: They uncover achievements as soon as they find out about them.

1179
01:23:55,265 --> 01:24:01,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it turns out the achievement list spoils the entire character roster for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.

1180
01:24:01,447 --> 01:24:01,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1181
01:24:01,687 --> 01:24:02,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we know who's in the game.

1182
01:24:03,328 --> 01:24:05,389
[SPEAKER_06]: And Midway kind of danced around this.

1183
01:24:05,509 --> 01:24:07,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you know someone was pissed.

1184
01:24:07,371 --> 01:24:09,312
[SPEAKER_06]: You know somebody's head was rolling after this.

1185
01:24:09,632 --> 01:24:12,174
[SPEAKER_06]: They initially said, we have not officially released it.

1186
01:24:12,234 --> 01:24:15,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they came back and said, yeah, okay, it's true.

1187
01:24:15,696 --> 01:24:16,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Dongle between our legs.

1188
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:17,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Run away.

1189
01:24:17,897 --> 01:24:18,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yipe, yipe, yipe.

1190
01:24:18,738 --> 01:24:20,639
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so here's the characters from Mortal Kombat.

1191
01:24:20,699 --> 01:24:30,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Baraka, Jax, Kano, Katana, Liu Kang, Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, Sonya, and Sub-Zero.

1192
01:24:30,785 --> 01:24:31,125
[SPEAKER_06]: DC Universe

1193
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:00,355
[SPEAKER_06]: DC Universe, Catwoman, Darkseed, Deathstroke, Darkseid,

1194
01:25:24,567 --> 01:25:31,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Flash, Green Lantern, The Joker, Lex Luthor, Shazam, Superman, and Wonder Woman

1195
01:25:47,338 --> 01:25:54,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but that's what they're going to refer to him as in the game, probably, I guess, because if they're pulling this off the achievement list, they must be referring to him as that in the game.

1196
01:25:54,502 --> 01:25:55,422
[SPEAKER_06]: So, interesting.

1197
01:25:57,303 --> 01:25:57,843
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1198
01:25:58,423 --> 01:25:59,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm excited.

1199
01:25:59,644 --> 01:26:02,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we can finally throw down Wonder Woman vs. Catwoman.

1200
01:26:03,026 --> 01:26:03,766
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be awesome.

1201
01:26:04,546 --> 01:26:05,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to that.

1202
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:07,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this game comes out soon.

1203
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:08,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Be on the lookout for it.

1204
01:26:08,748 --> 01:26:09,709
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be out before the holidays.

1205
01:26:11,275 --> 01:26:12,296
[SPEAKER_06]: and, uh, there you go.

1206
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:13,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1207
01:26:13,316 --> 01:26:14,677
[SPEAKER_04]: November 19th, if I remember correctly.

1208
01:26:14,697 --> 01:26:15,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

1209
01:26:15,257 --> 01:26:15,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1210
01:26:16,378 --> 01:26:17,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Just in time for Thanksgiving.

1211
01:26:18,138 --> 01:26:20,540
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wish they'd have, like, other unlockable characters later on.

1212
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,240
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be neat.

1213
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,601
[SPEAKER_06]: They may, and they may have pay-to-unlock characters.

1214
01:26:23,621 --> 01:26:24,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1215
01:26:24,121 --> 01:26:27,563
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is the first Mortal Kombat on the next-gen system, am I right?

1216
01:26:27,943 --> 01:26:28,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1217
01:26:28,363 --> 01:26:29,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so who knows?

1218
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:31,165
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have the downloadable characters.

1219
01:26:31,185 --> 01:26:31,805
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be kind of cool.

1220
01:26:32,745 --> 01:26:33,566
[SPEAKER_13]: DC Universe, DC Universe

1221
01:26:53,144 --> 01:26:54,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark Hamill is the one.

1222
01:26:54,665 --> 01:26:55,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1223
01:26:55,326 --> 01:27:03,012
[SPEAKER_13]: When I think Joker, when I'm not thinking of the comic books, I'm thinking of animated series Joker just because he's so goofball.

1224
01:27:03,353 --> 01:27:03,873
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's cool.

1225
01:27:04,073 --> 01:27:06,495
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't think about the movies, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson?

1226
01:27:06,515 --> 01:27:07,916
[SPEAKER_13]: I have not seen Dark Knight, remember?

1227
01:27:09,037 --> 01:27:10,118
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to see it in IMAX.

1228
01:27:10,498 --> 01:27:11,559
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty impressive.

1229
01:27:11,719 --> 01:27:13,001
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to see it in IMAX.

1230
01:27:13,301 --> 01:27:13,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It's here.

1231
01:27:14,201 --> 01:27:15,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1232
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:17,484
[SPEAKER_13]: When I go see it, it will be in IMAX.

1233
01:27:18,445 --> 01:27:18,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun.

1234
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:21,948
[SPEAKER_13]: But this makes me very, very, very, very giddy.

1235
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:23,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft agrees in chatroom.

1236
01:27:23,911 --> 01:27:29,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.orange.com says Mark Hamill is the Joker and Solid Goomba simply says, fuck yeah, Mark Hamill.

1237
01:27:29,914 --> 01:27:32,295
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it about Mark Hamill that makes him so fucking amazing?

1238
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:34,376
[SPEAKER_13]: He does the best Joker.

1239
01:27:34,436 --> 01:27:34,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1240
01:27:35,397 --> 01:27:41,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Then he was, what was it in Jay and Silent Bob Cockknocker?

1241
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he was also in Jay and Silent Bob Strikeback.

1242
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:44,862
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's more news.

1243
01:27:46,482 --> 01:27:48,083
[SPEAKER_13]: You could appear in the game.

1244
01:27:48,703 --> 01:27:49,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1245
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:49,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Me?

1246
01:27:49,303 --> 01:27:51,144
[SPEAKER_13]: There could be Rob in the game.

1247
01:27:51,244 --> 01:27:51,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Me?

1248
01:27:51,464 --> 01:27:52,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Little me?

1249
01:27:53,265 --> 01:27:59,227
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a contest right now from GI that will allow the winner to become an Arkham inmate.

1250
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:02,968
[SPEAKER_13]: And you get your cell decked out with personal photos and wall scribbles.

1251
01:28:03,109 --> 01:28:04,149
[SPEAKER_06]: That's more of a Loki role.

1252
01:28:05,309 --> 01:28:05,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you think?

1253
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:07,330
[SPEAKER_13]: I would be all over that.

1254
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:12,252
[SPEAKER_13]: And all of my graffiti would be, Hi Mom, I'm in jail.

1255
01:28:12,992 --> 01:28:13,653
[SPEAKER_13]: I like it here.

1256
01:28:13,773 --> 01:28:14,313
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nice.

1257
01:28:14,935 --> 01:28:24,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, and I don't know if Travis still does this on Under Station Live, but maybe my voice could be something like, I've been here for seven years, the medication doesn't work.

1258
01:28:25,379 --> 01:28:27,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Does he still do that on Under Station Live?

1259
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:27,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know.

1260
01:28:30,682 --> 01:28:32,202
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds weird.

1261
01:28:32,242 --> 01:28:38,685
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there was this old soundbite he used to play all the freaking time of this guy going, I've been here for seven years.

1262
01:28:39,878 --> 01:28:42,659
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Dark Knight says, I can't see Jamie being in jail.

1263
01:28:42,699 --> 01:28:44,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, how little you know Jamie.

1264
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in jail before.

1265
01:28:58,695 --> 01:29:01,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Alabama, they make you either sleep or read the Bible.

1266
01:29:01,257 --> 01:29:01,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

1267
01:29:27,509 --> 01:29:28,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And then my mom came and got me.

1268
01:29:30,551 --> 01:29:30,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1269
01:29:31,272 --> 01:29:31,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I never knew that.

1270
01:29:31,953 --> 01:29:32,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1271
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Six years and I never knew that Jamie was in jail.

1272
01:29:37,517 --> 01:29:39,539
[SPEAKER_13]: There's quite a bit about me you don't know, Rob.

1273
01:29:39,559 --> 01:29:40,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently.

1274
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the internet snows.

1275
01:29:43,702 --> 01:29:44,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't real jail.

1276
01:29:44,503 --> 01:29:44,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1277
01:29:44,903 --> 01:29:45,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't real jail.

1278
01:29:45,824 --> 01:29:46,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1279
01:29:46,204 --> 01:29:47,245
[SPEAKER_06]: We all did dumb shit as a kid.

1280
01:29:47,585 --> 01:29:47,865
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1281
01:29:47,905 --> 01:29:48,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Loki.

1282
01:29:49,448 --> 01:30:00,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, with the announcement of the price drop last week, the Xbox sales numbers are apparently doubling, according to Microsoft.

1283
01:30:00,156 --> 01:30:03,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess we'll have to see when the MPD numbers come out at the beginning of October.

1284
01:30:04,519 --> 01:30:06,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's pretty promising.

1285
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not a big surprise that, I don't know...

1286
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,241
[SPEAKER_04]: It's selling well when it's cheaper.

1287
01:30:12,962 --> 01:30:15,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's, I guess, a shocker to a lot of people.

1288
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:17,565
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait, no, it's not.

1289
01:30:17,785 --> 01:30:18,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Christmas yet?

1290
01:30:20,266 --> 01:30:22,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens with this.

1291
01:30:22,368 --> 01:30:22,988
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm curious.

1292
01:30:23,048 --> 01:30:24,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a trend that's going to continue through Christmas?

1293
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:25,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1294
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:29,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Are Xbox 360s now going to sell because everybody got a Wii last Christmas?

1295
01:30:30,313 --> 01:30:30,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1296
01:30:30,733 --> 01:30:30,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1297
01:30:31,514 --> 01:30:36,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I still hear, and it really irks me, not that I'm picking sides or anything, but

1298
01:30:38,288 --> 01:30:38,708
[SPEAKER_03]: But you are.

1299
01:30:39,989 --> 01:30:40,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not.

1300
01:30:40,889 --> 01:30:41,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, I'm not.

1301
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:44,690
[SPEAKER_04]: But when Sony comes out and says, oh yeah, we're winning.

1302
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:48,171
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you winning when you have a quarter of the market?

1303
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:48,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Abba.

1304
01:30:50,192 --> 01:30:50,372
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1305
01:30:51,132 --> 01:30:51,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Abba.

1306
01:30:51,892 --> 01:30:52,472
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

1307
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:55,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, Abba ain't gonna do shit.

1308
01:30:56,974 --> 01:30:57,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Bite your tongue.

1309
01:30:57,794 --> 01:30:58,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Abba ain't gonna do shit.

1310
01:30:58,955 --> 01:30:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.

1311
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:00,895
[SPEAKER_04]: No one buys SingStar.

1312
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, nobody.

1313
01:31:03,236 --> 01:31:04,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're in Europe.

1314
01:31:04,676 --> 01:31:05,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate you.

1315
01:31:05,096 --> 01:31:05,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know you anymore.

1316
01:31:05,857 --> 01:31:06,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I just own you as a friend.

1317
01:31:08,117 --> 01:31:08,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1318
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:11,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Mamma Mia sucked.

1319
01:31:11,684 --> 01:31:13,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of my house!

1320
01:31:17,795 --> 01:31:23,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It just irks me when they say that they're winning, but it's like, dude, listen, you're not even close to winning.

1321
01:31:23,317 --> 01:31:33,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you were like, you know, the Wii back in June when you were like 10,000 units away from becoming number one, yeah, that's close to winning.

1322
01:31:33,722 --> 01:31:37,244
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're millions of units behind, that's not close to winning.

1323
01:31:37,544 --> 01:31:40,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so don't talk that you're going to do it.

1324
01:31:40,305 --> 01:31:41,566
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to do it by like year's end.

1325
01:31:41,646 --> 01:31:42,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not.

1326
01:31:42,106 --> 01:31:43,407
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to do it by year's end.

1327
01:31:44,995 --> 01:31:46,096
[SPEAKER_04]: 2011, okay, so stop it.

1328
01:31:46,717 --> 01:31:47,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1329
01:31:47,617 --> 01:31:51,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So, are you saying that SingStarAba's not going to sell well?

1330
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:57,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you care to make a little wager on SingStarAba selling well or not?

1331
01:31:57,584 --> 01:31:58,124
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not.

1332
01:32:00,025 --> 01:32:01,086
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be Tingle.

1333
01:32:01,306 --> 01:32:02,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I can think of far better punishments.

1334
01:32:03,307 --> 01:32:04,168
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not.

1335
01:32:06,018 --> 01:32:06,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.

1336
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody make chicken noises at Loki.

1337
01:32:09,086 --> 01:32:11,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll think about it, but I'm pretty sure it's not.

1338
01:32:11,772 --> 01:32:13,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he said I think about it.

1339
01:32:13,597 --> 01:32:14,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta do my research.

1340
01:32:15,925 --> 01:32:18,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, I will totally play Singstar with you.

1341
01:32:18,625 --> 01:32:18,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1342
01:32:19,466 --> 01:32:20,946
[SPEAKER_13]: You're getting the ABBA one, right?

1343
01:32:20,986 --> 01:32:25,907
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat room is demanding it on Justin TV when it comes out.

1344
01:32:26,527 --> 01:32:27,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

1345
01:32:28,347 --> 01:32:28,667
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1346
01:32:32,308 --> 01:32:33,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

1347
01:32:33,928 --> 01:32:37,589
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see how the Xbox 360 sells after the price drop.

1348
01:32:37,609 --> 01:32:40,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on into Christmas, I think they're going to continue to sell pretty well.

1349
01:32:41,269 --> 01:32:44,030
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is, will they overtake Nintendo or will Sony answer them?

1350
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:45,170
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another one.

1351
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:47,880
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people seem doubtful, but who knows?

1352
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:55,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Another game that a lot of folks have been playing on their Xbox 360s as well as their PlayStation 3s, Burnout Paradise.

1353
01:32:55,923 --> 01:33:00,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And the long-awaited motorcycle download is coming on September 18th.

1354
01:33:00,724 --> 01:33:02,685
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a new patch, basically.

1355
01:33:02,725 --> 01:33:04,266
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a free download update.

1356
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:09,828
[SPEAKER_06]: 38 new clock race events, dynamic weather events, effects...

1357
01:33:10,882 --> 01:33:20,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Dynamic Weather Effects, a day-night cycle, meaning the game goes up from day to night, 70 new challenges in the Freeburns thing, and motorcycles.

1358
01:33:20,571 --> 01:33:23,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool, but when are they adding the airplanes?

1359
01:33:23,114 --> 01:33:24,935
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to know, because they're talking about adding airplanes.

1360
01:33:25,456 --> 01:33:27,077
[SPEAKER_13]: What about giant enemy crabs?

1361
01:33:27,618 --> 01:33:30,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I want to be able to drive a giant enemy crab.

1362
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:31,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1363
01:33:32,963 --> 01:33:39,268
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of those games that I played for like three days and I never played again, and I keep thinking I need to go back and play it again.

1364
01:33:39,328 --> 01:33:42,771
[SPEAKER_06]: This is giving me the incentive to do so, so I'm definitely going to have to check it out.

1365
01:33:43,172 --> 01:33:43,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds pretty cool.

1366
01:33:44,193 --> 01:33:46,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you been playing any Burnout Paradise, Loki, or is this kind of put it away?

1367
01:33:46,915 --> 01:33:51,859
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just noticed the other day that I still have my copy of Burnout Paradise sitting on a shelf.

1368
01:33:53,298 --> 01:34:21,788
[SPEAKER_04]: um it just came out at a bad time from what I remember I need to go back and look look at it again it was better than the last one but I don't know it's just when the next big game came out I forgot about it and sadly enough you know with like Rock Band 2 and stuff when Saints Row 2 comes out I'm gonna forget about Rock Band 2 never I'll never forget about Rock Band 2 hey they're doing a pretty good job trying to extend the life of it with the challenges and everything but anyway let's move on

1369
01:34:22,674 --> 01:34:23,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on.

1370
01:34:23,795 --> 01:34:24,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

1371
01:34:25,337 --> 01:34:29,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know one of my favorite ever companies is Capcom, right?

1372
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:31,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1373
01:34:32,185 --> 01:34:33,046
[SPEAKER_13]: They were nice to me.

1374
01:34:33,607 --> 01:34:34,828
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why they were mean to you.

1375
01:34:35,269 --> 01:34:36,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have to go back there again?

1376
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:37,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Because don't get me started.

1377
01:34:38,012 --> 01:34:39,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not go there.

1378
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:51,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Capcom is planning on doing all of their major titles on multiple platforms to maximize their impact in the United States, especially outside of Japan.

1379
01:34:51,554 --> 01:34:57,737
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually quoted as saying basically where the consoles are practically waging war on one another.

1380
01:34:58,677 --> 01:34:59,838
[SPEAKER_13]: and their annual report.

1381
01:35:01,038 --> 01:35:11,642
[SPEAKER_13]: It said, completing implementation of multi-platform development on major titles means that all major titles launched during the next fiscal year or thereafter will be developed as multi-platform games.

1382
01:35:12,462 --> 01:35:19,265
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why we should be, that's why Devil May Cry 4, for example.

1383
01:35:20,345 --> 01:35:21,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Mega Man 9.

1384
01:35:21,346 --> 01:35:22,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Mega Man 9, exactly.

1385
01:35:22,046 --> 01:35:25,047
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of us assumed it was going to be WiiWare only and then suddenly it's shown up everywhere.

1386
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:47,416
[SPEAKER_13]: MT Framework is actually supposed to be for PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 development Resident Evil 5, Street Fighter 4 are among the list and so they're also thinking about including a few more casual games like for Wii and other more casual game systems

1387
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:49,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you talking about Man of Power Battles?

1388
01:36:05,313 --> 01:36:13,217
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was an actual side-scroller in the vein of the Nintendo games, but with better graphics at the time, because it was on PC.

1389
01:36:13,658 --> 01:36:16,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe somebody in the chatroom knows more about this and can remember.

1390
01:36:16,059 --> 01:36:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually bought this game way back when, in the early 90s, and it had three boss monsters, so it was short.

1391
01:36:22,122 --> 01:36:24,543
[SPEAKER_06]: But I remember one of them was electricity-based, as you remember.

1392
01:36:26,264 --> 01:36:28,806
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't based on... They were new Mega Man monsters.

1393
01:36:29,606 --> 01:36:31,147
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a completely different Mega Man game.

1394
01:36:32,488 --> 01:36:33,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not crazy.

1395
01:36:33,638 --> 01:37:01,453
[SPEAKER_13]: well in other news they also are they stated also again in their annual report Capcom did that there are more western focused titles in development one of them named Dark Void if you know we remember that and they plan to aggressively acquire partners and other studios especially independent developers the ones that will share their vision so I think that that's

1396
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:06,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounding to me like a potential good thing.

1397
01:37:10,663 --> 01:37:12,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I found the information on Wikipedia.

1398
01:37:12,585 --> 01:37:13,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you now?

1399
01:37:13,085 --> 01:37:15,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was by Hitech Expressions.

1400
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:16,388
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released in 1990.

1401
01:37:16,948 --> 01:37:19,130
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just licensed by Capcom.

1402
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:23,053
[SPEAKER_06]: There were three robot masters, Voltman, Sonicman, and Dynaman.

1403
01:37:23,453 --> 01:37:25,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were only two levels in the Wily Fortress.

1404
01:37:25,795 --> 01:37:26,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a short game.

1405
01:37:27,469 --> 01:37:28,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd say.

1406
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:31,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were other versions on PC, I guess, too.

1407
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:32,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I never knew about those.

1408
01:37:32,334 --> 01:37:33,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had the first one.

1409
01:37:33,315 --> 01:37:34,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think the PC versions were very good.

1410
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:39,682
[SPEAKER_06]: They were cool when I was a kid, but I don't think they're cool now.

1411
01:37:39,802 --> 01:37:39,962
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1412
01:37:40,002 --> 01:37:40,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks to you.

1413
01:37:40,903 --> 01:37:42,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Huh?

1414
01:37:42,345 --> 01:37:44,207
[SPEAKER_13]: The Airman Can't Be Defeated song.

1415
01:37:46,489 --> 01:37:47,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Whose fault is that?

1416
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:47,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Yours.

1417
01:37:49,545 --> 01:38:00,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some things that are good come in threes, I guess, including a bundle that's being released by Microsoft coming out later this holiday.

1418
01:38:01,413 --> 01:38:14,903
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a brand new 12-month live gold kit, and it's going to come with Project Gotham Racing 4, a 12-plus-one-month card of live, and the Xbox...

1419
01:38:16,444 --> 01:38:18,746
[SPEAKER_04]: 360 Messenger Kit and it's going to run you $69.99.

1420
01:38:19,086 --> 01:38:30,757
[SPEAKER_04]: This was rumored to be coming out from the GameStop Expo although it's on their website now and I personally know it's coming out so it is coming out.

1421
01:38:30,897 --> 01:38:31,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a good deal.

1422
01:38:32,899 --> 01:38:38,724
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some other bundle that they were talking about coming out as well that I haven't heard anything on but I know this one for sure is coming out.

1423
01:38:40,555 --> 01:38:41,495
[SPEAKER_06]: RedRingsOfDeath.com

1424
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:06,000
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1425
01:39:29,979 --> 01:39:54,024
[SPEAKER_06]: apparently he went on and talked about these two different Red Ring of Death scenarios a reproducible crash that could happen in NBA 2K6 was one game that you could reproduce the crash in and apparently some dashboard update bugs in Dead Rising apparently he's being very standoffish about it he doesn't care that the former employer of his wants to sue him and says if they want to come after me, bring it on

1426
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:56,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

1427
01:39:57,121 --> 01:40:02,926
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, he did probably violate the terms of employment that he had with Microsoft and all these companies that he was working through.

1428
01:40:02,966 --> 01:40:07,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you do kind of don't talk about the products like this, especially on a website.

1429
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:14,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little... I hope he knows what he's talking about because he's going to have to prove, well...

1430
01:40:15,461 --> 01:40:17,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess he's going to have to prove that he's telling the truth.

1431
01:40:18,724 --> 01:40:20,846
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says, wow, the cojones on this guy.

1432
01:40:20,866 --> 01:40:21,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for real.

1433
01:40:21,907 --> 01:40:24,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma says, didn't he sign an NDA that forbade him from saying this?

1434
01:40:24,609 --> 01:40:25,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure he must have.

1435
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:30,534
[SPEAKER_13]: If he didn't sign the NDA, unless it was specific, or I don't know.

1436
01:40:31,676 --> 01:40:42,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, but even still though, I mean, they can get him on that, but at the same time, I mean, he's hoping to open like a whole other can of worms with, you know, Microsoft knew about these defects and they didn't do anything about it.

1437
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:45,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, I see, so he's trying to be a hero, basically.

1438
01:40:45,244 --> 01:40:45,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1439
01:40:46,444 --> 01:40:47,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we know what happens to heroes.

1440
01:40:48,145 --> 01:40:48,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1441
01:40:48,425 --> 01:40:49,346
[SPEAKER_06]: They become martyrs.

1442
01:40:51,887 --> 01:40:53,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's hope it doesn't get that bad.

1443
01:40:53,668 --> 01:40:54,829
[SPEAKER_06]: But, well, there you go.

1444
01:40:55,529 --> 01:41:00,112
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll keep you updated if we hear anything else in the adventures of this guy and his soon-to-be legal troubles.

1445
01:41:00,643 --> 01:41:02,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, something that might not be soon to happen.

1446
01:41:02,543 --> 01:41:10,505
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they're talking about it, but I'm still thinking that it'll be out when another title with its name comes out.

1447
01:41:11,925 --> 01:41:15,486
[SPEAKER_13]: There's supposed to be a Duke Nukem movie.

1448
01:41:16,606 --> 01:41:16,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1449
01:41:17,327 --> 01:41:27,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Scott Fay, the one who's doing Max Payne, was saying that he's working on a movie scenario that he thinks will do the character and the series justice.

1450
01:41:28,729 --> 01:41:28,969
[SPEAKER_13]: But

1451
01:41:31,033 --> 01:41:37,115
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm honestly really expecting to see it more along the lines of when Duke Nukem Forever comes out.

1452
01:41:37,715 --> 01:41:38,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

1453
01:41:39,235 --> 01:41:52,199
[SPEAKER_13]: But he also says that Depth Entertainment will be doing with trying to work on a few other cross-media franchises going into games and film.

1454
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,160
[SPEAKER_13]: And

1455
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:58,964
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually are still at work at doing American McGee's Alice.

1456
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:02,467
[SPEAKER_13]: And Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't doing that anymore, by the way.

1457
01:42:03,988 --> 01:42:04,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

1458
01:42:05,609 --> 01:42:05,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1459
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:10,013
[SPEAKER_13]: You know she changed her last name officially for her husband?

1460
01:42:11,294 --> 01:42:14,316
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of those Hollywood relationships that has actually stayed together, so good for them.

1461
01:42:14,576 --> 01:42:18,059
[SPEAKER_13]: As an anniversary present, I thought that was really sweet.

1462
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:29,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you want to hear something even more ridiculous, there was a rumor coming around about a Craigslist entry that said they were casting for a Rock Band 2 TV show.

1463
01:42:29,768 --> 01:42:35,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently it is true, and it's going to be officially launched next week.

1464
01:42:36,093 --> 01:42:38,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band 2, the show, and...

1465
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:41,661
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1466
01:42:59,385 --> 01:43:02,447
[SPEAKER_06]: And what exactly will be on the Rock Band show?

1467
01:43:02,547 --> 01:43:04,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Just watching people play Rock Band?

1468
01:43:04,607 --> 01:43:09,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, you're going to follow... I guess they're going to set up some band teams or whatever.

1469
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:12,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 30-minute commercial for the game is what it is.

1470
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:13,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, yeah.

1471
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:16,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when you're MTV and you put out the game, you can kind of do that.

1472
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:18,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, you know what?

1473
01:43:18,974 --> 01:43:22,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see this being much worse than some of the other programming on that station.

1474
01:43:22,555 --> 01:43:24,596
[SPEAKER_04]: True, I guess it would be better than The Hills.

1475
01:43:24,896 --> 01:43:25,397
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1476
01:43:26,517 --> 01:43:40,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I don't know about you guys, but when I hear about one of my favorite music games, Jumping the Shark, and becoming a half-hour commercial TV series, and reminding us why MTV is a little bit poison for this series, or a lot of it poison, I get very angsty.

1477
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:45,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you guys, but it makes me just want to get out the angst in a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

1478
01:44:01,365 --> 01:44:04,287
[SPEAKER_13]: My FU goes to bullshit and the mouths it spews from.

1479
01:44:06,509 --> 01:44:06,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1480
01:44:07,289 --> 01:44:16,976
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU goes to EA for saying that the Rock Band 2 drums are supposed to be out today and not actually shipping the Rock Band 2 drums to anybody, so it's a big clusterfuck.

1481
01:44:18,257 --> 01:44:18,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1482
01:44:20,076 --> 01:44:24,539
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU goes to whatever little animal decided to crawl under our house and die.

1483
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:31,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it happened on, I guess, Friday when we started noticing that something smells like death.

1484
01:44:32,344 --> 01:44:36,506
[SPEAKER_06]: So now the animal control people aren't going to be able to even come out until Monday because we think it's a cat.

1485
01:44:37,487 --> 01:44:41,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there was a cat that was sometimes in our backyard that just looked like hell.

1486
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:43,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not around anymore.

1487
01:44:44,423 --> 01:44:52,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, although I am sad for little kitty, F you to deciding to die under our house and not in, say, the neighbor's pool.

1488
01:44:53,014 --> 01:44:53,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1489
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just gross.

1490
01:44:59,563 --> 01:44:59,843
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1491
01:45:00,284 --> 01:45:01,245
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for the FUs of the week.

1492
01:45:03,103 --> 01:45:09,007
[SPEAKER_06]: But boy, we get into some FUs of the century when we talk about some of the gaming industry's biggest controversies they've ever had.

1493
01:45:09,628 --> 01:45:12,450
[SPEAKER_06]: This is on a website called MCVUK.com.

1494
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:15,152
[SPEAKER_06]: They ran a top ten list this week of gaming's biggest controversies.

1495
01:45:15,532 --> 01:45:19,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, if you want to get your website on Digg, just add a top ten list.

1496
01:45:19,435 --> 01:45:19,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1497
01:45:20,035 --> 01:45:24,999
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you ever see on Digg are these top ten lists from these sites I'd never heard of until I see the top ten list.

1498
01:45:25,459 --> 01:45:26,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

1499
01:45:27,661 --> 01:45:30,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, here's a quick rundown of what the controversies are.

1500
01:45:30,523 --> 01:45:31,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one...

1501
01:45:31,724 --> 01:45:32,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Night Trap with Dana Plato

1502
01:45:49,363 --> 01:45:50,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Caramageddon Caramageddon

1503
01:46:17,398 --> 01:46:18,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Caramageddon!

1504
01:46:42,878 --> 01:46:46,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, in Summer Showdown for the U.S.

1505
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,722
[SPEAKER_13]: one they put in, well, I think it was the U.S.

1506
01:46:48,742 --> 01:46:51,364
[SPEAKER_13]: one they had sweat instead of blood like in the Japanese one.

1507
01:46:51,656 --> 01:46:52,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a little silly.

1508
01:46:53,217 --> 01:46:54,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the German one, they had robots.

1509
01:46:55,058 --> 01:46:57,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even people, but robots that you ran over.

1510
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:05,885
[SPEAKER_06]: America's Army is number four, and it has to do with that, you know, the game was developed and is being used as a recruitment tool.

1511
01:47:06,705 --> 01:47:12,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Ubisoft kind of has gotten itself in a little bit of trouble for publishing the console version of the title.

1512
01:47:12,909 --> 01:47:20,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there was like a demonstration outside of their offices after this whole thing, because they actually went and published a console version, and that was...

1513
01:47:22,012 --> 01:47:22,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Really bad.

1514
01:47:25,167 --> 01:47:28,829
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a giant recruitment tool, which in a way is controversial in itself.

1515
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:33,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Number five was something called Murder by PlayStation.

1516
01:47:34,712 --> 01:47:39,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently it was some type of story that was actually released.

1517
01:47:39,654 --> 01:47:43,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was a headline that was actually in a paper on the Daily Mail.

1518
01:47:43,736 --> 01:47:48,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was actually a story about a 14-year-old kid who was murdered by a 17-year-old kid.

1519
01:47:48,798 --> 01:47:52,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And the newspaper claimed that the kid was obsessed with Manhunt.

1520
01:47:53,021 --> 01:47:58,189
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, police did say there was absolutely no link between the game and the killing.

1521
01:47:59,231 --> 01:48:04,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But yet that headline, Murder by PlayStation, giant bold letters, still exists.

1522
01:48:05,071 --> 01:48:07,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 6 on the list, The Guy Game.

1523
01:48:07,734 --> 01:48:09,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember The Guy Game, Loki?

1524
01:48:09,335 --> 01:48:11,137
[SPEAKER_06]: We covered The Guy Game on this program.

1525
01:48:11,277 --> 01:48:14,400
[SPEAKER_06]: The Guy Game was awesome, except for the 17-year-old that got in it.

1526
01:48:15,261 --> 01:48:17,783
[SPEAKER_06]: That caused the game to get pulled from shelves everywhere.

1527
01:48:18,064 --> 01:48:19,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, seriously.

1528
01:48:19,605 --> 01:48:23,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, because tits on a 17-year-old really change a lot in a year.

1529
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:25,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1530
01:48:26,311 --> 01:48:26,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gay.

1531
01:48:27,872 --> 01:48:30,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't... Actually, no, it wouldn't be gay.

1532
01:48:30,393 --> 01:48:31,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't... Unless you're a woman.

1533
01:48:32,053 --> 01:48:33,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that game screws another of the same gender.

1534
01:48:34,915 --> 01:48:38,556
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just... I mean, obviously, it's a big no-no and very irresponsible.

1535
01:48:38,576 --> 01:48:39,877
[SPEAKER_06]: It's her fault anyway.

1536
01:48:39,937 --> 01:48:41,137
[SPEAKER_06]: She lied about her age.

1537
01:48:41,998 --> 01:48:43,278
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just irresponsible.

1538
01:48:43,298 --> 01:48:43,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Dumb bitch.

1539
01:48:43,998 --> 01:48:47,340
[SPEAKER_06]: But the game... They could be having Guy Game 4 by now.

1540
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:52,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you cut this little element out of the game, we'd be on, like, Guy Game, you know, on Xbox Live Arcade.

1541
01:48:52,602 --> 01:48:53,202
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome.

1542
01:48:53,342 --> 01:48:54,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.

1543
01:48:54,683 --> 01:48:54,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

1544
01:48:55,819 --> 01:48:59,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 7, Hot Coffee, All I Need to Say.

1545
01:49:00,561 --> 01:49:02,642
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't know enough about that by now, where have you been?

1546
01:49:03,242 --> 01:49:06,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 8 was when the BBFC tackled Ban Hunt 2.

1547
01:49:06,423 --> 01:49:12,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there was all the controversy around that, and then that got banned, and then it wasn't, and then the game sucked anyway, remember?

1548
01:49:13,886 --> 01:49:20,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 9 was Goat Gate, which is another way to refer to, remember the Greek god launch party for God of War 2 over in Europe?

1549
01:49:21,389 --> 01:49:22,949
[SPEAKER_06]: And they actually slaughtered a live goat.

1550
01:49:24,010 --> 01:49:24,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that?

1551
01:49:25,982 --> 01:49:29,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that... Marketing genius over there.

1552
01:49:32,826 --> 01:49:33,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Dot, dot, dot.

1553
01:49:33,746 --> 01:49:34,747
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have to say.

1554
01:49:34,867 --> 01:49:35,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Dot, dot, dot.

1555
01:49:35,968 --> 01:49:39,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last controversy on the list, because I know you're all loving this.

1556
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:41,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony versus God.

1557
01:49:42,471 --> 01:49:52,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has to do with the fact that the Church of England was actually used, Manchester Cathedral, its church, was actually used in Resistance Fall of Man, and they were not happy about that.

1558
01:49:52,857 --> 01:50:10,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that we covered that on the show a little while ago so there you have it the top 10 biggest controversies according to MCV UK so it is a little more UK based hence why we had a couple of those in there but I would say UK or not those are pretty good entries on the list very controversial anything you think they left off

1559
01:50:11,715 --> 01:50:19,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the PSP ad that was almost racist because it had the white and the black and it was bad.

1560
01:50:19,801 --> 01:50:20,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that?

1561
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:22,943
[SPEAKER_06]: That was somehow left off the list.

1562
01:50:23,563 --> 01:50:26,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Just another brilliant Sony marketing scheme from the day.

1563
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:27,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you guys can think of?

1564
01:50:27,106 --> 01:50:27,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1565
01:50:27,686 --> 01:50:28,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they hit most of the good ones.

1566
01:50:30,928 --> 01:50:31,629
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see in chat.

1567
01:50:31,669 --> 01:50:34,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if anybody thinks of anything.

1568
01:50:34,611 --> 01:50:36,012
[SPEAKER_06]: No Custer's Revenge either.

1569
01:50:36,832 --> 01:50:39,334
[SPEAKER_06]: There's usually a Custer's Revenge that shows up on a list like that.

1570
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:44,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's see what you guys have to say in our mailbag.

1571
01:50:44,321 --> 01:50:49,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week you guys email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read your emails here live on the show.

1572
01:50:49,803 --> 01:50:52,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's open up ye olde mailbag and see what emails we've got.

1573
01:50:59,186 --> 01:51:04,448
[SPEAKER_13]: First email comes from Cheeseburger and it says, I'm sorry I got you mad last week.

1574
01:51:04,588 --> 01:51:06,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you please tell me more about Gatchaman, please?

1575
01:51:06,849 --> 01:51:07,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I spell that right?

1576
01:51:07,449 --> 01:51:08,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you did spell it right.

1577
01:51:08,749 --> 01:51:09,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Gatchaman is awesome!

1578
01:51:11,794 --> 01:51:15,639
[SPEAKER_13]: 1972 anime character designs done by Amano.

1579
01:51:16,259 --> 01:51:19,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Just go look it up on Wikipedia and then go watch all of it.

1580
01:51:20,384 --> 01:51:21,645
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the only way you'll appease me.

1581
01:51:23,267 --> 01:51:23,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1582
01:51:24,454 --> 01:51:25,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, OLR crew.

1583
01:51:25,695 --> 01:51:26,535
[SPEAKER_13]: This next email, by the way.

1584
01:51:27,536 --> 01:51:33,799
[SPEAKER_13]: After listening to last week's show, I figured it right in to clarify on what the Rob D was saying about me shaking while at the mic.

1585
01:51:34,599 --> 01:51:37,741
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't while at the mic that my hands started to shake, but after.

1586
01:51:38,321 --> 01:51:45,605
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a bit of a rush being on the air with a bunch of internet celebrities who are too humble to admit they really are celebrities, however minor.

1587
01:51:46,225 --> 01:51:46,945
[SPEAKER_13]: I am not.

1588
01:51:47,926 --> 01:51:51,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I am actually egotistical enough to admit my celebrity-dom on the internet.

1589
01:51:53,086 --> 01:51:54,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Curse you, Adrenaline!

1590
01:51:54,887 --> 01:52:04,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, it was great meeting you all at PAX and was very glad that I made it to Wild Ginger that night in one piece as the food and conversation were awesome.

1591
01:52:04,911 --> 01:52:06,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knew mango could make pork taste like beef?

1592
01:52:06,932 --> 01:52:09,694
[SPEAKER_06]: This is talking about the Chinese restaurant all us all games people went to, yeah?

1593
01:52:09,814 --> 01:52:12,595
[SPEAKER_13]: As I ordered the mango pork and it was freaking fantastic.

1594
01:52:13,515 --> 01:52:14,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the food I had was good too.

1595
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:18,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus I had to be the best stand pad thai I've ever had.

1596
01:52:18,761 --> 01:52:22,384
[SPEAKER_13]: It made being lost in the scuzzy part of Seattle at night totally worth it.

1597
01:52:22,684 --> 01:52:23,965
[SPEAKER_13]: That was really good pad thai.

1598
01:52:24,205 --> 01:52:25,446
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with that because I had some too.

1599
01:52:26,507 --> 01:52:31,330
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't just write to reminisce and sing praises though.

1600
01:52:31,650 --> 01:52:36,093
[SPEAKER_13]: A few episodes back you guys were talking about Dragon's Lair and Space Ace and they should be put on PS3.

1601
01:52:36,373 --> 01:52:39,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Well good news, not only are they playable on PS3, but any Blu-ray player...

1602
01:52:41,465 --> 01:52:48,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I've actually had them in stock where I work for quite some time now, and I'm kind of shocked they aren't on shelves with the games at other stores as well.

1603
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:50,571
[SPEAKER_13]: You can put links on Amazon.

1604
01:52:51,011 --> 01:52:57,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I think the reason I didn't get them is because I've already got the HD versions for PC.

1605
01:52:57,976 --> 01:53:00,798
[SPEAKER_13]: But I hope I passed the grammar Nazi test here.

1606
01:53:01,098 --> 01:53:05,641
[SPEAKER_13]: You almost did, but for right is W-R-I-T-E, not R-I-G-H-T.

1607
01:53:07,222 --> 01:53:09,423
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait until next year's PAX, assuming I can go.

1608
01:53:09,483 --> 01:53:10,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheers, Decipher.

1609
01:53:12,253 --> 01:53:12,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1610
01:53:12,974 --> 01:53:13,074
[SPEAKER_13]: P.S.

1611
01:53:13,494 --> 01:53:18,418
[SPEAKER_13]: This email was brought to you by the OLR Mailbag, home of the never-ending Olive Garden references.

1612
01:53:19,399 --> 01:53:21,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually haven't had an Olive Garden reference in a little while, but there you go.

1613
01:53:22,121 --> 01:53:22,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1614
01:53:22,641 --> 01:53:23,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, let's go to Olive Garden.

1615
01:53:23,882 --> 01:53:25,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I really want Olive Garden.

1616
01:53:25,103 --> 01:53:25,664
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to.

1617
01:53:26,044 --> 01:53:27,145
[SPEAKER_06]: You know where I went this week?

1618
01:53:27,445 --> 01:53:28,426
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Carino's.

1619
01:53:28,686 --> 01:53:29,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Good stuff.

1620
01:53:30,148 --> 01:53:30,688
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never been there.

1621
01:53:31,529 --> 01:53:32,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Nom, nom, nom.

1622
01:53:32,169 --> 01:53:35,552
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd take you to Pasquale's, but I don't think they have anything light, though.

1623
01:53:36,348 --> 01:53:42,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we should go to a little... They have a little joint here in Sacramento called Español, which is the Italian place with a Spanish name.

1624
01:53:42,509 --> 01:53:43,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really good.

1625
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:43,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1626
01:53:43,630 --> 01:53:45,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a very yummy minestrone soup.

1627
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:47,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm, Orange Lounge Foodio.

1628
01:53:47,811 --> 01:53:48,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, OLR.

1629
01:53:49,311 --> 01:53:49,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

1630
01:53:50,571 --> 01:53:54,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to say, I love that on this show when we're not talking about video games, we're talking about food.

1631
01:53:54,952 --> 01:53:55,292
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

1632
01:53:55,312 --> 01:53:56,032
[SPEAKER_13]: I have gushy foods.

1633
01:53:57,673 --> 01:54:00,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, Rob D says Never Ending Pasta is going on at Olive Garden right now.

1634
01:54:00,854 --> 01:54:02,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, we are there, okay?

1635
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:13,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, OLR, I read this on the FAQs of EA's new Sports World site, which is their online community for their sports games.

1636
01:54:14,137 --> 01:54:17,019
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the questions is why there's no female avatar option.

1637
01:54:17,419 --> 01:54:22,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Their response was, quote, question, why is there no female avatar image?

1638
01:54:22,503 --> 01:54:28,386
[SPEAKER_13]: In an effort to align EA Sports World with our primary user base, the decision was made to use a male avatar image for its launch.

1639
01:54:28,787 --> 01:54:31,609
[SPEAKER_13]: However, a female avatar image is planned for future releases soon.

1640
01:54:32,489 --> 01:54:35,251
[SPEAKER_13]: is it just me or are they making an assumption about who plays their games?

1641
01:54:35,391 --> 01:54:47,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a female but I think that it is kind of sexist to gear a sports game towards males only and assume that all the women are playing Barbie Island Princess or bake cakes although cakes are great

1642
01:54:49,059 --> 01:55:00,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I am completely stupid and don't see why this is okay, but I'm sure many women across the world play sports games and other types of traditionally male games like GTA, other FPSs, etc.

1643
01:55:01,089 --> 01:55:05,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thanks for reading this, and remember, if you are in the All Games chatroom, DMN can't kick you.

1644
01:55:06,334 --> 01:55:09,016
[SPEAKER_13]: The cake is light, PKJr92, Yaris sucks.

1645
01:55:09,216 --> 01:55:14,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have to understand that until EA Sports releases, you know...

1646
01:55:16,022 --> 01:55:22,108
[SPEAKER_04]: DinnerMaking09, you know, they're not going to have female avatars, unfortunately.

1647
01:55:23,890 --> 01:55:27,894
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says in chat, translation, their response was, girls don't play games.

1648
01:55:28,395 --> 01:55:29,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this true, DarkSakura?

1649
01:55:29,476 --> 01:55:30,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Do girls not play games?

1650
01:55:32,222 --> 01:55:33,323
[SPEAKER_13]: I beg to differ.

1651
01:55:34,343 --> 01:55:35,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a feeling.

1652
01:55:35,124 --> 01:55:38,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet we have some more listeners out there that beg to differ as well.

1653
01:55:38,966 --> 01:55:39,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember though, Rob.

1654
01:55:40,307 --> 01:55:40,527
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1655
01:55:40,667 --> 01:55:43,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember me telling you that there was a football game I actually liked?

1656
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:45,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Tecmo Bowl.

1657
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:46,351
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl.

1658
01:55:46,791 --> 01:55:47,132
[SPEAKER_13]: It was...

1659
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, now I can't remember, but it had a cool name.

1660
01:55:52,683 --> 01:55:57,150
[SPEAKER_13]: It was that one football game that was on Super Nintendo.

1661
01:55:57,290 --> 01:55:58,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Must have had a lasting impression.

1662
01:55:59,653 --> 01:56:00,835
[SPEAKER_13]: I can never remember the name of it, too.

1663
01:56:00,855 --> 01:56:02,137
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the problem with it.

1664
01:56:02,217 --> 01:56:03,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it with the four-player thing?

1665
01:56:03,418 --> 01:56:04,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it Super Tecmo Bowl?

1666
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:06,663
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it wasn't Tecmo Bowl anything.

1667
01:56:07,256 --> 01:56:35,469
[SPEAKER_06]: High Impact High Impact, thank you, it was super high impact I just had a feeling, and I said that before I saw DarkTips to be a Satan shit I was gonna say also that, um, yeah, girls don't play games and EA doesn't release games that aren't buggy That just means that girls play good games You know how I feel about sports games, you guys Look, I respect those of you guys that choose to play them, but for me, Tecmo Bowl or GTFO No, it's all about that hockey game on Saturn

1668
01:56:37,543 --> 01:56:38,664
[SPEAKER_06]: or Blades of Steel.

1669
01:56:39,165 --> 01:56:39,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1670
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:41,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, go ahead.

1671
01:56:42,048 --> 01:56:44,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Hockey is fantastic too because blood bounces on ice.

1672
01:56:45,611 --> 01:56:47,633
[SPEAKER_06]: You know NHL 09 came out this last week.

1673
01:56:48,394 --> 01:56:49,635
[SPEAKER_06]: We should check it out just for fun.

1674
01:56:49,655 --> 01:56:51,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to watch hockey regularly.

1675
01:56:51,497 --> 01:56:52,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into sports games.

1676
01:56:52,738 --> 01:56:54,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't buy NHL 09.

1677
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:56,141
[SPEAKER_13]: I want a rugby game.

1678
01:56:56,802 --> 01:56:58,904
[SPEAKER_13]: I want someone to send me a rugby game, okay?

1679
01:56:59,184 --> 01:57:24,155
[SPEAKER_06]: apparently it's got some sort of memory leak in the cache file on the on your hard drive and will stop working after a while oh shit can you imagine if we came on the show one week and during how was your gaming week suddenly it's like Jamie's talking about yeah I played NHL 09 this week I'm like yeah I played Madden Loki's like I played Hello Kitty Island Adventure and then we never mind no it would be like I was gonna say then we'd be AGI but you know

1680
01:57:29,027 --> 01:57:39,456
[SPEAKER_13]: If you wanted to do the complete role reversal here, I would be playing Imagine Babies, and Rob would be playing Yaris, and Matt would be playing the Tingle game.

1681
01:57:41,301 --> 01:57:42,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tangle game, seriously.

1682
01:57:43,303 --> 01:57:44,625
[SPEAKER_04]: For April Fool's Day next year.

1683
01:57:44,665 --> 01:57:45,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, next email, next email.

1684
01:57:45,886 --> 01:57:47,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey guys, Dan Shadow here.

1685
01:57:47,848 --> 01:57:51,071
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been meaning to email you guys for quite some time, but I've been very busy lately.

1686
01:57:51,191 --> 01:57:51,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to the club.

1687
01:57:52,753 --> 01:57:57,498
[SPEAKER_13]: If this email seems long, it's because with every new episode, there's a new subject to talk about.

1688
01:57:57,978 --> 01:57:59,240
[SPEAKER_13]: This segment goes to Rob.

1689
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:00,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi Rob!

1690
01:58:00,401 --> 01:58:01,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi me!

1691
01:58:01,882 --> 01:58:02,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this from?

1692
01:58:02,903 --> 01:58:03,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan Shadow.

1693
01:58:03,664 --> 01:58:04,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi Dan Shadow.

1694
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:08,351
[SPEAKER_13]: A while back you mentioned going out to Long Beach and visiting the Queen Mary.

1695
01:58:08,731 --> 01:58:13,233
[SPEAKER_13]: I laughed when you mentioned that because I currently live in Long Beach and next year I will be getting married on the Queen Mary.

1696
01:58:13,473 --> 01:58:14,454
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big boat.

1697
01:58:15,434 --> 01:58:16,795
[SPEAKER_13]: My wedding will be booze themed.

1698
01:58:17,155 --> 01:58:17,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Chew on that.

1699
01:58:18,776 --> 01:58:18,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

1700
01:58:19,276 --> 01:58:22,577
[SPEAKER_13]: I also wanted to point out that I am your Brazilian listener.

1701
01:58:23,057 --> 01:58:26,519
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't been there in 10 years because, well, it's just better to live here.

1702
01:58:26,899 --> 01:58:30,760
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I will return next summer to have my new wife meet my family there.

1703
01:58:31,221 --> 01:58:33,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Brazilian listener!

1704
01:58:33,482 --> 01:58:33,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1705
01:58:35,809 --> 01:58:37,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been craving Brazilian grill.

1706
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:39,171
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even know how long.

1707
01:58:39,531 --> 01:58:40,512
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm talking about.

1708
01:58:40,532 --> 01:58:42,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Espatuse place in San Francisco.

1709
01:58:42,413 --> 01:58:43,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never been there, Rob.

1710
01:58:43,633 --> 01:58:47,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they have a thing like it in Sacramento now called Taste of Brazil or something like that.

1711
01:58:48,156 --> 01:58:52,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically that's where they bring the big slabs of meat on the swords and just slice off a slab of meat.

1712
01:58:52,678 --> 01:58:53,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have to order in Portuguese?

1713
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:55,480
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't believe you do.

1714
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:56,421
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't order at all.

1715
01:58:56,461 --> 01:58:57,541
[SPEAKER_06]: You just pay.

1716
01:58:57,561 --> 01:58:58,622
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a little dial.

1717
01:58:58,662 --> 01:58:59,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Green means go.

1718
01:58:59,682 --> 01:59:00,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Red means stop.

1719
01:59:00,843 --> 01:59:01,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Sweet.

1720
01:59:01,964 --> 01:59:04,085
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so there when I'm eating meat again.

1721
01:59:05,322 --> 01:59:06,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Thinking about playing Warhammer Online?

1722
01:59:07,323 --> 01:59:07,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Do it!

1723
01:59:08,064 --> 01:59:11,445
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been in the closed and open beta, and I can tell you right now it's worth it.

1724
01:59:11,806 --> 01:59:12,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's an example.

1725
01:59:12,626 --> 01:59:16,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's say you're a squig hunter, and you want to drop aggro.

1726
01:59:17,008 --> 01:59:17,989
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't feign death.

1727
01:59:18,049 --> 01:59:21,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead, you will piss yourself, and the enemy won't touch you after that.

1728
01:59:22,901 --> 01:59:23,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1729
01:59:23,462 --> 01:59:30,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the orcs and goblins are on the comedic side, but if you want to be serious cool, then play as the high elves.

1730
01:59:30,069 --> 01:59:34,354
[SPEAKER_13]: I will be in the head start, so if you decide to get it, let me know and we can play on the same server.

1731
01:59:35,135 --> 01:59:36,557
[SPEAKER_13]: No, on the head server, sorry.

1732
01:59:36,857 --> 01:59:40,021
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it says I will be in the head start, so if you decide to play, blah blah.

1733
01:59:41,622 --> 01:59:43,604
[SPEAKER_13]: On another note, I can't wait for LittleBigPlanet.

1734
01:59:43,624 --> 01:59:46,047
[SPEAKER_13]: That seems like a game that can't possibly get old.

1735
01:59:46,487 --> 01:59:48,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and Rock Band 2 equals Party Night.

1736
01:59:48,669 --> 01:59:50,952
[SPEAKER_13]: This email is brought to you by StrongBad.

1737
01:59:51,372 --> 01:59:53,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Keeping my Wii alive with his never-ending style.

1738
01:59:55,151 --> 01:59:57,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Final Fantasy XI

1739
02:00:16,555 --> 02:00:18,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online!

1740
02:00:19,036 --> 02:00:19,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online!

1741
02:00:19,896 --> 02:00:20,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online!

1742
02:00:20,416 --> 02:00:20,496
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

1743
02:00:20,516 --> 02:00:21,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it, Rob!

1744
02:00:21,136 --> 02:00:21,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it!

1745
02:00:21,596 --> 02:00:24,297
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can level by yourself, then it's better.

1746
02:00:44,463 --> 02:01:13,389
[SPEAKER_06]: you can level, like let's say you're level 12 and your friend is level 70 your level 70 friend can cap himself to 12 and level with you and you guys both still get experience so you can level at any level, kinda neat I will stay level 1 forever seriously I will not be playing this bullshit Final Fantasy bullshit unless it's Penn and Teller's Final Fantasy bullshit then I'll play that

1747
02:01:14,625 --> 02:01:15,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I somehow don't see that happening.

1748
02:01:16,927 --> 02:01:17,888
[SPEAKER_13]: That should be a bullshit game.

1749
02:01:17,908 --> 02:01:18,288
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be cool.

1750
02:01:18,829 --> 02:01:24,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I do see myself going out, at least checking out Warhammer for a month or two before I see myself going back to Fafixi.

1751
02:01:25,715 --> 02:01:26,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, next email.

1752
02:01:26,976 --> 02:01:28,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Star Trek Online!

1753
02:01:28,337 --> 02:01:29,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then there's that.

1754
02:01:29,298 --> 02:01:30,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online!

1755
02:01:30,619 --> 02:01:32,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that gets delayed to 2010.

1756
02:01:32,341 --> 02:01:33,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Star Trek Online!

1757
02:01:33,922 --> 02:01:34,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, shut up.

1758
02:01:34,462 --> 02:01:35,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Read the next email.

1759
02:01:35,844 --> 02:01:36,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up and read.

1760
02:01:36,384 --> 02:01:36,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Jeez, Rob.

1761
02:01:37,725 --> 02:01:39,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, bite my big bloody left toe.

1762
02:01:40,548 --> 02:01:41,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, that's my right toe.

1763
02:01:42,308 --> 02:01:46,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey guys, I've been listening to your podcast for about the last year.

1764
02:01:47,291 --> 02:01:49,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though I can't listen to it live because I have school.

1765
02:01:50,533 --> 02:01:53,075
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are my favorite podcast and I never miss your show.

1766
02:01:53,715 --> 02:01:55,476
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't been able to get a 360 yet.

1767
02:01:55,616 --> 02:01:58,298
[SPEAKER_13]: It sucks because my mom and dad won't let me get one.

1768
02:01:58,418 --> 02:02:01,940
[SPEAKER_13]: They think that I shouldn't get another system even though I want to trade in my PS2.

1769
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:05,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, since I have nothing to do and want to save money, I've been...

1770
02:02:07,023 --> 02:02:08,564
[SPEAKER_13]: I have been playing free MMOs.

1771
02:02:08,604 --> 02:02:09,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Here are a couple and what they are.

1772
02:02:10,644 --> 02:02:11,364
[SPEAKER_13]: S4 League.

1773
02:02:11,724 --> 02:02:18,547
[SPEAKER_13]: This game is a third-person shooter that has anime-style graphics and these make it so you can do flips and other cool stuff like that.

1774
02:02:18,627 --> 02:02:21,688
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's at S4League.com MapleStory.

1775
02:02:22,708 --> 02:02:28,430
[SPEAKER_13]: You've probably heard of this one, but if you haven't, it's a platforming MMO that's kind of like Super Mario Bros., but you use weapons.

1776
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:29,290
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's at Nexon.com

1777
02:02:31,164 --> 02:02:32,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, these are all free and really fun.

1778
02:02:33,426 --> 02:02:33,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, guys.

1779
02:02:33,967 --> 02:02:34,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep up the great work.

1780
02:02:34,828 --> 02:02:39,193
[SPEAKER_13]: This email is brought to you by my Wii, PS2, GameCube, and any other system that I don't want anymore.

1781
02:02:39,693 --> 02:02:43,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Homes to the never-ending dust that collects on them because they're outdated and my parents don't let me trade them in.

1782
02:02:45,259 --> 02:02:45,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1783
02:02:46,761 --> 02:02:47,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

1784
02:02:48,102 --> 02:02:50,805
[SPEAKER_13]: I also do have to commend you on your...

1785
02:02:52,225 --> 02:02:54,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Fairly decent sentence structure and grammar.

1786
02:02:54,466 --> 02:02:55,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Gold star for this listener.

1787
02:02:55,987 --> 02:02:57,187
[SPEAKER_13]: You get a smiley face.

1788
02:02:58,027 --> 02:03:04,970
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Rob D, I was snickering during that email because I read this comment in chat from Rob D talking about Penn & Teller's Final Fantasy XI bullshit.

1789
02:03:05,650 --> 02:03:08,151
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, wait, so you want Final Fantasy Desert Bus?

1790
02:03:11,553 --> 02:03:12,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, you know what?

1791
02:03:12,533 --> 02:03:18,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes running from one end of the map to the other when you're not a high enough level to have a chocobo feels like playing Desert Bus.

1792
02:03:18,835 --> 02:03:19,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even fucking with you.

1793
02:03:21,491 --> 02:03:27,853
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what my whole thing was when I did play the game and was too low to actually make it across the desert without dying?

1794
02:03:28,253 --> 02:03:28,973
[SPEAKER_13]: I skirted the wall.

1795
02:03:31,274 --> 02:03:33,215
[SPEAKER_13]: I was doing maze business.

1796
02:03:33,335 --> 02:03:34,195
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you have to do.

1797
02:03:34,215 --> 02:03:35,816
[SPEAKER_13]: You skirt the wall and you hide.

1798
02:03:36,416 --> 02:03:37,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, oh my god, it's going to kill me.

1799
02:03:38,137 --> 02:03:39,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, last one.

1800
02:03:39,657 --> 02:03:39,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Ready?

1801
02:03:40,777 --> 02:03:41,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1802
02:03:41,338 --> 02:03:44,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Dun, dun, dun, from J-Rod, who originated that joke.

1803
02:03:46,399 --> 02:03:47,400
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have to give him props.

1804
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:48,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Props.

1805
02:03:48,973 --> 02:03:49,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, OLR.

1806
02:03:50,474 --> 02:03:55,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I've been waiting all year for TNA Impact to come out, and now it's finally released.

1807
02:03:55,197 --> 02:03:56,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I see nothing but terrible reviews for it.

1808
02:03:57,299 --> 02:04:02,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Bad grapple system, only five slots for creative wrestlers, only a handful of moves, and so on.

1809
02:04:02,682 --> 02:04:07,546
[SPEAKER_13]: I really hope the other games I'm looking forward to this year, Dead Space and Silent Hill Homecoming, don't suck.

1810
02:04:07,886 --> 02:04:09,887
[SPEAKER_13]: How can a Silent Hill game suck, okay?

1811
02:04:10,628 --> 02:04:16,452
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to ask, what was the biggest disappointment that you guys ever had to face with games you were highly anticipating?

1812
02:04:16,912 --> 02:04:20,576
[SPEAKER_13]: This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Neverending Salads and Breadsticks.

1813
02:04:22,058 --> 02:04:25,742
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have to say, one of the first ones that jumps into my mind was Nintendogs.

1814
02:04:26,362 --> 02:04:27,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say it.

1815
02:04:27,023 --> 02:04:33,891
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that Nintendogs is a bad game, but I just got so hyped for it at E3 that the bar got set so high that the game just couldn't live up to it.

1816
02:04:34,271 --> 02:04:34,872
[SPEAKER_06]: It really couldn't.

1817
02:04:36,113 --> 02:04:36,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried.

1818
02:04:39,048 --> 02:04:48,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember one time Dan and I, this is when Dan and I were playing a lot of wrestling games and we rented at the time WWF, or was it?

1819
02:04:49,502 --> 02:04:49,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Rumble Roses

1820
02:05:14,505 --> 02:05:15,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Rumble Roses was great.

1821
02:05:15,946 --> 02:05:21,309
[SPEAKER_13]: But at any rate, Dan and I decided that we were going to rent the... No, it was Thunder.

1822
02:05:21,369 --> 02:05:21,949
[SPEAKER_13]: That was it.

1823
02:05:22,109 --> 02:05:23,510
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was WCW Thunder.

1824
02:05:23,990 --> 02:05:34,496
[SPEAKER_13]: We rented it, got it home, played it for 10 minutes, and called the Hollywood or blockbuster that we got it from and took it back.

1825
02:05:35,256 --> 02:05:36,577
[SPEAKER_13]: And they let us take out another game.

1826
02:05:38,024 --> 02:05:38,864
[SPEAKER_13]: It was that bad.

1827
02:05:39,245 --> 02:05:44,848
[SPEAKER_13]: I just remember that that has been the one... Even Spice World didn't disappoint me that badly.

1828
02:05:45,368 --> 02:05:47,409
[SPEAKER_06]: At least you knew what you were going to get with Spice World.

1829
02:05:47,569 --> 02:05:48,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, shice.

1830
02:05:50,531 --> 02:05:53,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a night of endless laughs with Spice World.

1831
02:05:54,313 --> 02:05:56,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we were drunk, but it was really funny.

1832
02:05:56,714 --> 02:05:59,275
[SPEAKER_13]: There is one game that disappointed me, but it was Japanese release only.

1833
02:05:59,295 --> 02:06:00,136
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Super Producers.

1834
02:06:04,042 --> 02:06:06,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Super Producers was a game where you manage a pop idol's career.

1835
02:06:07,564 --> 02:06:12,128
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just disappointed me because it was a lot more language intense than I was prepared for.

1836
02:06:15,010 --> 02:06:24,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Gears of War, Halo 3, Bullet Witch, and... Oh, there's one more, I know it.

1837
02:06:25,518 --> 02:06:25,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1838
02:06:27,521 --> 02:06:28,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 Halo 2.5

1839
02:06:45,688 --> 02:07:05,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob D in chat says Mega Man X5 disappointed me a lot more recently that Infinite Undiscovery although I'm hearing if you can get past the first couple hours that suck it gets a lot better so I'm trying to force myself to play it more but now I have Rock Band I just won't play Rock Band all day

1840
02:07:07,099 --> 02:07:07,359
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1841
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:09,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And no other emails then, huh?

1842
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:10,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1843
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:14,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you have some mail you would like to contribute for next week's show.

1844
02:07:14,963 --> 02:07:17,684
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, a little more gaming news and then the Skype line.

1845
02:07:18,124 --> 02:07:18,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1846
02:07:19,425 --> 02:07:22,446
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple hacking and cracking stories we have.

1847
02:07:23,386 --> 02:07:32,531
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is a modification someone made using the Xbox 360 Messenger kit, and they turned it into a keyboard for the PSP.

1848
02:07:33,391 --> 02:07:33,551
[SPEAKER_04]: N.E.S.

1849
02:07:33,671 --> 02:07:34,092
[SPEAKER_04]: into a toaster

1850
02:07:54,972 --> 02:07:55,512
[SPEAKER_04]: and why?

1851
02:07:55,932 --> 02:07:56,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's funny.

1852
02:07:57,153 --> 02:07:57,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

1853
02:07:57,553 --> 02:08:01,134
[SPEAKER_06]: They made a Nintendo out of a toaster or they turned a Nintendo into a toaster?

1854
02:08:01,534 --> 02:08:05,236
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a toaster and they put a Nintendo inside of it.

1855
02:08:05,356 --> 02:08:05,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1856
02:08:06,616 --> 02:08:11,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually has apparently some LED lights in the case that light up.

1857
02:08:13,139 --> 02:08:16,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it lights up red like it's cooking because that would be pretty funny.

1858
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,681
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, NES toaster.

1859
02:08:24,707 --> 02:08:28,928
[SPEAKER_06]: The National Science Foundation gave $100,000 to do a study for World of Warcraft

1860
02:08:52,352 --> 02:08:53,133
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1861
02:09:15,716 --> 02:09:16,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

1862
02:09:16,356 --> 02:09:20,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a quote from the study or from the lady involved with the study.

1863
02:09:32,501 --> 02:09:34,181
[SPEAKER_06]: At least they mentioned them in more interviews.

1864
02:09:34,261 --> 02:09:39,002
[SPEAKER_06]: They talked more about color schemes, animations, architecture, and so on, more than American players.

1865
02:09:39,782 --> 02:09:44,983
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes on to say that the Chinese players, they actually don't really play with add-ons and modifications.

1866
02:09:45,043 --> 02:09:49,784
[SPEAKER_06]: They like the challenge of the core game, whereas in America we like to mod our game to hell.

1867
02:09:50,684 --> 02:09:51,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

1868
02:09:51,564 --> 02:09:54,245
[SPEAKER_06]: She's getting paid $100,000 to finish this research.

1869
02:09:54,865 --> 02:10:02,106
[SPEAKER_06]: She's doing it along with a student going after their doctoral, and will be doing some type of final paper that I'm sure will be published all over the internet when it's done.

1870
02:10:03,815 --> 02:10:05,195
[SPEAKER_06]: $100,000 to study WoW.

1871
02:10:07,096 --> 02:10:08,736
[SPEAKER_06]: You can really get a job doing anything.

1872
02:10:08,916 --> 02:10:10,377
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I guess that's neat.

1873
02:10:10,537 --> 02:10:12,397
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of like, wow, there's a lot.

1874
02:10:12,437 --> 02:10:15,778
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you think about the complex layers, I guess there is a lot to study.

1875
02:10:15,818 --> 02:10:19,679
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just kind of curious, what will be contributed to society from the results?

1876
02:10:19,739 --> 02:10:22,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a way for us to better understand each other through games?

1877
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:25,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't people just actually socially interact?

1878
02:10:25,721 --> 02:10:27,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's right, because people are scary.

1879
02:10:27,361 --> 02:10:27,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1880
02:10:28,862 --> 02:10:29,882
[SPEAKER_13]: People are scary!

1881
02:10:31,343 --> 02:10:32,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how about some more news?

1882
02:10:34,209 --> 02:10:34,609
[SPEAKER_06]: How about it?

1883
02:10:34,629 --> 02:10:35,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that make you giddy, Rob?

1884
02:10:36,331 --> 02:10:36,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1885
02:10:37,031 --> 02:10:47,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, speaking, because we did have an email earlier regarding... Warhammer?

1886
02:10:48,039 --> 02:10:48,219
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1887
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:48,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1888
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:49,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1889
02:10:50,641 --> 02:10:52,563
[SPEAKER_13]: I stopped working.

1890
02:10:53,563 --> 02:10:54,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was Warhammer.

1891
02:10:54,444 --> 02:10:54,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1892
02:10:57,301 --> 02:11:05,487
[SPEAKER_13]: There was an announcement put out that there are actually server types and server names for Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning.

1893
02:11:05,947 --> 02:11:12,732
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a core open RVR, which is Realm vs. Realm, roleplay, and roleplay slash open RVR.

1894
02:11:13,312 --> 02:11:14,233
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's pretty cool.

1895
02:11:15,514 --> 02:11:24,339
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to have the standard gameplay, but you've got unrestricted PvP combat on the core server.

1896
02:11:27,622 --> 02:11:33,425
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on Realm vs. Realm, you have to be flagged for combat to do PvP stuff.

1897
02:11:35,287 --> 02:11:39,730
[SPEAKER_13]: You can also permanently flag people on the open Realm vs. Realm servers.

1898
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:44,793
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, roleplay servers are basically getting into your character, roleplaying.

1899
02:11:45,273 --> 02:11:45,734
[SPEAKER_13]: We know this.

1900
02:11:47,225 --> 02:12:14,225
[SPEAKER_06]: which hopefully they actually enforce unlike in WoW I mean I guess you can file tickets in WoW but it seems like you always get a bunch of a-holes on there and they're like haha RP and it's like dude you signed up for an RP server what the F were you expecting I know right I've done a roleplay server before for World of Warcraft I had a lot of fun I played a real bitch like that's you know any different that's not roleplaying Jamie that's real life you see this ferret I do

1901
02:12:16,448 --> 02:12:17,128
[SPEAKER_13]: BendOverRob.

1902
02:12:18,850 --> 02:12:19,070
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1903
02:12:19,150 --> 02:12:19,590
[SPEAKER_13]: No ferrets.

1904
02:12:20,831 --> 02:12:26,234
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, those are the type of servers that are out, so that's pretty cool.

1905
02:12:28,396 --> 02:12:30,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know which one I'm playing on yet, if I get the game.

1906
02:12:31,038 --> 02:12:31,138
[SPEAKER_06]: If.

1907
02:12:31,998 --> 02:12:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: If.

1908
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:33,299
If.

1909
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:35,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1910
02:12:36,441 --> 02:12:44,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fascinated by the fact that apparently they changed the name of Africa in Japan to Hakuna Matata.

1911
02:12:44,887 --> 02:12:45,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1912
02:12:46,172 --> 02:12:46,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Akuna Matata

1913
02:13:16,946 --> 02:13:18,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seriously thinking about buying this though.

1914
02:13:18,187 --> 02:13:20,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the fucking raddest name for a game ever though.

1915
02:13:20,348 --> 02:13:21,268
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only $54.90.

1916
02:13:21,548 --> 02:13:21,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1917
02:13:22,589 --> 02:13:24,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's coming out here eventually, right?

1918
02:13:24,950 --> 02:13:26,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, but I don't know.

1919
02:13:27,711 --> 02:13:28,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I like things I can get early.

1920
02:13:29,432 --> 02:13:29,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1921
02:13:29,812 --> 02:13:31,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, back on topic here.

1922
02:13:32,272 --> 02:13:33,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Bioshock.

1923
02:13:33,553 --> 02:13:35,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a PS3 game now.

1924
02:13:35,253 --> 02:13:36,994
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it will be in October.

1925
02:13:37,794 --> 02:13:41,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And as with most PS3 games, it will require an install.

1926
02:13:41,875 --> 02:13:47,957
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't worry, that'll be an entertaining 10 minutes as you watch Rapture-related advertisements and music.

1927
02:13:50,663 --> 02:13:51,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

1928
02:13:51,203 --> 02:13:51,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1929
02:13:51,603 --> 02:13:53,564
[SPEAKER_04]: He found his aroma like a certain appeal.

1930
02:13:53,584 --> 02:13:57,245
[SPEAKER_04]: He could clear the savannah after every meal.

1931
02:13:57,285 --> 02:14:03,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a sensitive soul, though I sing thick skinned.

1932
02:14:20,811 --> 02:14:23,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if this game is in English.

1933
02:14:23,492 --> 02:14:25,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it too much to get the freaking chorus?

1934
02:14:32,734 --> 02:14:38,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted the freaking chorus, but the little samples on iTunes have the little chorus pre-verses there.

1935
02:14:39,595 --> 02:14:39,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame.

1936
02:14:41,755 --> 02:14:44,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Hakuna Matata.

1937
02:14:46,656 --> 02:14:47,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Hakuna Matata.

1938
02:14:48,357 --> 02:14:49,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Harry Potter!

1939
02:14:50,438 --> 02:14:55,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Hakuna Matata, Harry Potter What do they have to do with each other, Rob?

1940
02:15:09,306 --> 02:15:12,889
[SPEAKER_06]: and instead they're getting Twilight out in the movie theaters this Christmas.

1941
02:15:13,629 --> 02:15:15,370
[SPEAKER_06]: But Harry Potter got pushed back to next summer.

1942
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:19,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this should be kind of a duh, but the game got pushed back as well.

1943
02:15:19,633 --> 02:15:25,077
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, EA confirmed this week that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the game has been delayed.

1944
02:15:25,357 --> 02:15:30,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though I would think the game is pretty much done, but maybe they'll take some time to go back and tweak it.

1945
02:15:30,981 --> 02:15:37,265
[SPEAKER_06]: What's kind of sad about this, though, is that EA now is not going to get the profits from this game until their next fiscal quarter.

1946
02:15:37,645 --> 02:15:38,446
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a loss.

1947
02:15:39,366 --> 02:15:39,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

1948
02:15:41,728 --> 02:15:47,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will be out in video game form when the movie comes out summer 2009.

1949
02:15:48,712 --> 02:15:50,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure a lot of you kids can't wait.

1950
02:15:51,473 --> 02:15:52,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we getting a Twilight video game?

1951
02:15:54,155 --> 02:15:54,295
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1952
02:15:54,315 --> 02:15:54,955
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to know.

1953
02:15:55,456 --> 02:15:55,676
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

1954
02:15:56,276 --> 02:15:57,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's that tie in?

1955
02:15:58,697 --> 02:16:03,380
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, uh... I want my sparkling vampires in a video game.

1956
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:03,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1957
02:16:04,701 --> 02:16:05,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Vampires that sparkle?

1958
02:16:07,622 --> 02:16:08,363
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too cool.

1959
02:16:08,857 --> 02:16:15,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, our Skype line's open at Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1960
02:16:15,824 --> 02:16:17,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quickly, though, some last-minute stories.

1961
02:16:18,527 --> 02:16:21,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I know you had something about EA and Take-Two, right?

1962
02:16:21,690 --> 02:16:22,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1963
02:16:22,471 --> 02:16:23,612
[SPEAKER_06]: The final nail in the coffin.

1964
02:16:23,652 --> 02:16:24,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Breaking news.

1965
02:16:25,094 --> 02:16:27,877
[SPEAKER_04]: EA gives up on Take-Two acquisition.

1966
02:16:28,137 --> 02:16:28,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's official.

1967
02:16:30,165 --> 02:16:31,865
[SPEAKER_04]: They will not buy them out.

1968
02:16:48,170 --> 02:16:52,091
[SPEAKER_04]: of other due diligence materials provided by Take-Two.

1969
02:16:52,251 --> 02:16:58,273
[SPEAKER_04]: EA has decided not to make a proposal to acquire Take-Two and has terminated discussions with Take-Two.

1970
02:16:58,633 --> 02:17:04,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, could it be all those times that they said, no, no, no, stop bothering me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1971
02:17:05,455 --> 02:17:08,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it just took them going, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1972
02:17:09,176 --> 02:17:09,796
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't see you.

1973
02:17:09,876 --> 02:17:10,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't hear you.

1974
02:17:10,537 --> 02:17:11,877
[SPEAKER_06]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1975
02:17:14,321 --> 02:17:16,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Skyblind's open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1976
02:17:16,562 --> 02:17:18,783
[SPEAKER_06]: His name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1977
02:17:18,823 --> 02:17:20,104
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take some calls.

1978
02:17:21,564 --> 02:17:22,185
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start here.

1979
02:17:22,305 --> 02:17:23,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1980
02:17:23,425 --> 02:17:23,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1981
02:17:24,966 --> 02:17:25,686
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Zaku.

1982
02:17:26,067 --> 02:17:26,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Zaku.

1983
02:17:26,987 --> 02:17:27,847
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, my friend?

1984
02:17:29,188 --> 02:17:29,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Not much.

1985
02:17:29,868 --> 02:17:31,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Just chilling on a boring Sunday night.

1986
02:17:32,209 --> 02:17:33,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Except for you guys.

1987
02:17:33,210 --> 02:17:34,310
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just making it all better.

1988
02:17:34,611 --> 02:17:35,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1989
02:17:35,111 --> 02:17:38,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, are you getting DDRX this week?

1990
02:17:38,673 --> 02:17:39,393
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a Ditter fan.

1991
02:17:40,782 --> 02:17:53,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm on a wait-and-see right now, and since I'm unemployed and I need work right now, I need to hold off on spending splurging money on luxuries such as video games.

1992
02:17:53,308 --> 02:17:54,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's definitely understandable.

1993
02:17:55,670 --> 02:17:58,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you know the location test happened last week, right?

1994
02:17:59,452 --> 02:18:01,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, throughout the better part of last week.

1995
02:18:01,953 --> 02:18:02,713
[SPEAKER_14]: It just ended today.

1996
02:18:03,514 --> 02:18:04,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah?

1997
02:18:04,154 --> 02:18:04,614
[SPEAKER_06]: How'd that go?

1998
02:18:05,835 --> 02:18:05,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I...

1999
02:18:06,567 --> 02:18:13,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, from what I've known, from what those folks were able to test out there, it's shaping up to be a pretty good mix.

2000
02:18:14,571 --> 02:18:16,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I have a real quick question.

2001
02:18:16,092 --> 02:18:18,613
[SPEAKER_04]: DDRX, isn't that supposed to be coming out soon in the arcades?

2002
02:18:18,653 --> 02:18:18,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2003
02:18:18,853 --> 02:18:21,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they tested the arcade machine.

2004
02:18:21,635 --> 02:18:22,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what they were testing.

2005
02:18:22,875 --> 02:18:23,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2006
02:18:23,375 --> 02:18:23,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2007
02:18:24,096 --> 02:18:25,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you remember that... What?

2008
02:18:26,437 --> 02:18:29,879
[SPEAKER_04]: You went into that store Gamers Empire with me, remember, by the Folsom Theatres?

2009
02:18:29,899 --> 02:18:32,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't go into it, but I... You know of it, yeah.

2010
02:18:32,060 --> 02:18:32,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I know of it, yeah.

2011
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:40,644
[SPEAKER_04]: They're converting the front of their store into an arcade now, and they have told me that they are probably going to get DDRX.

2012
02:18:41,665 --> 02:18:41,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

2013
02:18:42,557 --> 02:18:43,237
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be fucking awesome.

2014
02:18:43,257 --> 02:18:46,858
[SPEAKER_14]: It all depends on whether or not they just buy the full cab or the upgrade kit.

2015
02:18:47,058 --> 02:18:49,579
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be the full freaking cabinet.

2016
02:18:49,619 --> 02:18:50,819
[SPEAKER_04]: They said it's really expensive.

2017
02:18:51,899 --> 02:18:55,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, that cab that was used in the location test is not final.

2018
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:58,041
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like a prototype right now.

2019
02:18:58,081 --> 02:19:02,502
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically a test pad for what Konami's trying to do.

2020
02:19:03,522 --> 02:19:05,363
[SPEAKER_14]: According to what the rep said over there.

2021
02:19:06,283 --> 02:19:07,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're ditching Betsy.

2022
02:19:08,063 --> 02:19:11,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is great news since now Konami's restarting their arcade division.

2023
02:19:12,478 --> 02:19:13,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't know they were restarting it.

2024
02:19:13,798 --> 02:19:14,399
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

2025
02:19:14,899 --> 02:19:25,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because that's what the, you know, the folks, the guys who were running the test, you know, the folks in the arcade, you know, Konami's arcade division, that's what they were telling the folks who were at the test.

2026
02:19:26,422 --> 02:19:26,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

2027
02:19:27,062 --> 02:19:28,102
[SPEAKER_14]: They said we're starting over.

2028
02:19:28,402 --> 02:19:29,283
[SPEAKER_06]: We are starting over.

2029
02:19:30,003 --> 02:19:30,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, indeed.

2030
02:19:30,843 --> 02:19:32,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and that's how they mean it.

2031
02:19:32,543 --> 02:19:35,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this mean we might get Silent Hill arcade game over here finally?

2032
02:19:36,485 --> 02:19:38,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if it means that no, you know,

2033
02:19:38,962 --> 02:19:49,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, we won't have that American incompetence holding back certain, you know, basically tainting the good name of DDR with shitty cabs and just piss poor service.

2034
02:19:50,131 --> 02:19:53,914
[SPEAKER_14]: It means that Konami is actually doing something right.

2035
02:19:53,934 --> 02:19:55,695
[SPEAKER_14]: They're actually doing it themselves this time.

2036
02:19:57,857 --> 02:20:00,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, any other thoughts, Zaku, on your mind before we get to another call?

2037
02:20:01,825 --> 02:20:07,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, just the fact that Securom and EA is just killing PC gaming.

2038
02:20:08,488 --> 02:20:11,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes, the whole DRM.

2039
02:20:11,729 --> 02:20:14,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you can't run away from this discussion somewhere on the internet.

2040
02:20:14,590 --> 02:20:19,972
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just talking about it with Bobby on his show a little bit when we were doing the little toss-over that he does at the end of his show.

2041
02:20:21,032 --> 02:20:21,713
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's...

2042
02:20:22,933 --> 02:20:27,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unfortunate that the people who are actually selling out the money to get the games are the ones that are getting punished.

2043
02:20:27,095 --> 02:20:37,100
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I was going to buy Command & Conquer, you know, I was going to buy Red Alert 3 until I found out that it was basically boiled down to something almost akin to a rental.

2044
02:20:37,641 --> 02:20:48,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's something I'm not cool with because I don't want to be, you know, first and foremost, there's no way I'm going to be treated as a criminal first and then have to prove my innocence.

2045
02:20:48,767 --> 02:20:49,207
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the...

2046
02:20:50,489 --> 02:20:54,191
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.

2047
02:20:54,911 --> 02:21:00,634
[SPEAKER_06]: It does make me wish that the game would come out on consoles, you know, because it's sad for PC gamers.

2048
02:21:00,934 --> 02:21:04,316
[SPEAKER_14]: I would want to use my keyboard and mouse instead of the controller.

2049
02:21:05,376 --> 02:21:09,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Technically you can use the keyboard on 360, it's just there's really only one game that necessitates it.

2050
02:21:09,178 --> 02:21:10,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Will the game support those two peripherals?

2051
02:21:10,999 --> 02:21:11,880
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I want to know.

2052
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:12,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish it would.

2053
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:16,522
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, then I might as well just skip it until they ditch the...

2054
02:21:17,462 --> 02:21:21,145
[SPEAKER_14]: and the protections on the PC version, which is the one I wanted to buy in the first place.

2055
02:21:21,846 --> 02:21:28,652
[SPEAKER_14]: It just sucks it had to be like that, but hopefully we'll hit EA where it hurts, in their wallets.

2056
02:21:29,312 --> 02:21:30,133
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

2057
02:21:30,213 --> 02:21:32,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Sakura, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but have a good one, okay?

2058
02:21:33,374 --> 02:21:34,015
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you too.

2059
02:21:34,035 --> 02:21:34,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

2060
02:21:57,990 --> 02:22:01,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you currently a Warcraft player that's considering leaving for Warhammer?

2061
02:22:01,372 --> 02:22:03,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some of the responses we got via Twitter.

2062
02:22:03,653 --> 02:22:07,676
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68 says, I don't play MMOs, except the real occasional Albatross 18.

2063
02:22:08,756 --> 02:22:10,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And I apologize if I mispronounce your names, guys.

2064
02:22:11,218 --> 02:22:14,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Dustoise says, I'm actually waiting for Champions Online.

2065
02:22:14,139 --> 02:22:17,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I love City of Heroes villains and would love an updated, better version of that.

2066
02:22:18,141 --> 02:22:21,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiara says, nope, still waiting patiently for Star Trek Online.

2067
02:22:22,644 --> 02:22:25,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Peker Uno says, simply, hell no.

2068
02:22:26,486 --> 02:22:28,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Tetsuya says, I'm just waiting for Diablo 3.

2069
02:22:29,129 --> 02:22:30,670
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Tyrant says, no and no.

2070
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:34,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen the war beta and it looks very similar to WoW and I'm not a huge PvP player.

2071
02:22:35,294 --> 02:22:36,315
[SPEAKER_06]: If I were, I might leave.

2072
02:22:37,536 --> 02:22:42,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Giavdea, sorry if I mispronounced that name, says, I'm waiting for Guild Wars 2.

2073
02:22:43,297 --> 02:22:47,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Misty OLR says, yeah, I'm with GS68, who said I don't play MMOs, 100% on this one.

2074
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:49,981
[SPEAKER_06]: My damn attention span doesn't help things either.

2075
02:22:50,621 --> 02:22:52,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Quiltipo says, will there be bards?

2076
02:22:52,842 --> 02:22:55,284
[SPEAKER_06]: If so, yes, give me a damn bard already, people.

2077
02:22:55,724 --> 02:22:59,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say it, but Fafixi has bards, and it's actually a pretty awesome class to play.

2078
02:23:00,066 --> 02:23:05,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says, considering that I was never into MMOs, Warhammer, even though it looks good, I won't be picking it up.

2079
02:23:05,749 --> 02:23:07,871
[SPEAKER_06]: MMOs are never-ending repeat cycles.

2080
02:23:08,491 --> 02:23:10,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Meowfrog says, I'm not buying Warhammer.

2081
02:23:11,013 --> 02:23:11,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I may later on.

2082
02:23:11,933 --> 02:23:13,415
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I do still play WoW.

2083
02:23:13,715 --> 02:23:16,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I have friends who have canceled their account for Warhammer.

2084
02:23:16,196 --> 02:23:17,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually know people that have done the same thing.

2085
02:23:18,078 --> 02:23:23,081
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to do a big rating alliance to do the 25 mans, and a bunch of them have quit to go to Warhammer.

2086
02:23:23,241 --> 02:23:23,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else.

2087
02:23:24,262 --> 02:23:26,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, here's another one I'll probably mispronounce.

2088
02:23:26,644 --> 02:23:29,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Spongetwang says, not buying Warhammer online.

2089
02:23:29,946 --> 02:23:34,450
[SPEAKER_06]: currently playing WoW sparingly as is, using spare and spare time for DDR.

2090
02:23:34,831 --> 02:23:40,236
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to point out, out of those 12 responses, not a single person said they're buying Warhammer.

2091
02:23:41,197 --> 02:23:41,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

2092
02:23:41,677 --> 02:23:46,542
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did have people saying that their friends are getting it, so maybe it's not going to be a huge game.

2093
02:23:47,743 --> 02:23:50,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly we have a very unscientific sample, but there you go.

2094
02:23:51,837 --> 02:23:53,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Geovay Day Paradox Vincent

2095
02:24:17,508 --> 02:24:18,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not much.

2096
02:24:18,248 --> 02:24:24,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to give a big shout out to you guys for playing I'm Having Trouble Beating Airman from Mario Payne.

2097
02:24:24,230 --> 02:24:25,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I really liked that.

2098
02:24:25,310 --> 02:24:26,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pretty much obsessed with that song.

2099
02:24:26,810 --> 02:24:27,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2100
02:24:27,171 --> 02:24:27,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I just...

2101
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:58,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I found it on YouTube a really long time ago, and I just kept listening to it and kept listening to it, and it's just a nice little Japanese rock song from some Japanese indie band.

2102
02:24:58,227 --> 02:25:01,148
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's about Mega Man, and I can't go wrong with that.

2103
02:25:02,009 --> 02:25:04,410
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like you could go in a Mega Man game, though, right?

2104
02:25:06,071 --> 02:25:06,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Mega Man 10.

2105
02:25:07,091 --> 02:25:12,794
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have a best-of, Mega Man All-Stars, as the best monsters from all the games.

2106
02:25:12,834 --> 02:25:14,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you like watching the videos that they make for these?

2107
02:25:18,444 --> 02:25:19,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you heard that.

2108
02:25:19,164 --> 02:25:21,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you like watching the videos that they make from these?

2109
02:25:22,965 --> 02:25:23,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

2110
02:25:23,906 --> 02:25:25,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's my favorite part.

2111
02:25:25,746 --> 02:25:28,907
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of my favorite parts of those, the little videos.

2112
02:25:28,967 --> 02:25:35,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't exactly know if they just hand animated them or if they're all pixeled, but yeah, that's one of my favorite parts about it.

2113
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:37,130
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2114
02:25:38,050 --> 02:25:38,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, very cool.

2115
02:25:39,110 --> 02:25:40,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you've been playing lately?

2116
02:25:40,771 --> 02:25:41,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and... Yeah.

2117
02:25:42,291 --> 02:25:44,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, actually, well, I mean...

2118
02:25:44,662 --> 02:25:47,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really been playing it, but... Well, I guess I have.

2119
02:25:47,343 --> 02:25:53,444
[SPEAKER_09]: A few weeks ago, I went over to a party, and I really started playing on my friend's PS3.

2120
02:25:53,704 --> 02:26:03,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And I used to really bash the PS3, but, you know, lately... And he sat me down, and... Can I do a really quick plug here?

2121
02:26:04,146 --> 02:26:04,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

2122
02:26:06,447 --> 02:26:09,007
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my friend's website.

2123
02:26:09,667 --> 02:26:11,468
[SPEAKER_09]: His name is Frank Castle, and he's...

2124
02:26:12,897 --> 02:26:16,960
[SPEAKER_09]: He runs this community called Arizona Hobbyist Paradise.

2125
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:17,480
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2126
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:18,941
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not the Punisher, is he?

2127
02:26:20,542 --> 02:26:22,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2128
02:26:25,185 --> 02:26:26,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Frank Castle is the Punisher's name.

2129
02:26:26,806 --> 02:26:27,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

2130
02:26:27,406 --> 02:26:30,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so he runs a comic thing in Arizona?

2131
02:26:31,649 --> 02:26:38,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well it's called Arizona Hobbyist Paradise and it's at hobbyistparadise.com

2132
02:26:40,959 --> 02:27:10,423
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's just for like AZ Arizona people who like gaming, anime and comics but I was playing on his PS3 and then he sat me down and then he's like you know the PS3 is starting to really gain a lot of ground in the gaming industry and I obviously disagreed with him but then he showed me this big list and I mean I'm looking at the PS3 exclusives right now and it used to kind of be like the big joke of gaming but I'm really thinking about picking up a PS3 really soon

2133
02:27:11,289 --> 02:27:16,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want one for LittleBigPlanet and Home definitely has me curious, but I think Sony still has a long way to go.

2134
02:27:17,373 --> 02:27:20,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of been a theme with them lately, and that's kind of worrisome.

2135
02:27:20,455 --> 02:27:28,460
[SPEAKER_06]: They were allowed to do a little bit of a slow launch with the PlayStation 2 because it was really the only thing out there, if I remember right, when it first came out.

2136
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:36,145
[SPEAKER_06]: But with the PSP, there wasn't a lot of must-have games on the PSP, and a lot of those patches that enabled the internet and all those things came out

2137
02:27:36,505 --> 02:27:38,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering have you ever heard of The Last Guy?

2138
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:01,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

2139
02:28:01,021 --> 02:28:04,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the last guy that's that one that was like that game in Work Time Fun.

2140
02:28:04,964 --> 02:28:08,126
[SPEAKER_04]: The one where it uses like the Google Map-esque stuff.

2141
02:28:08,146 --> 02:28:11,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, yeah, I think I remember hearing about this on a previous show, yeah.

2142
02:28:12,708 --> 02:28:17,832
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, uh, Pain, Pain looked pretty, it looked interesting.

2143
02:28:18,492 --> 02:28:21,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I hear it's a little silly, but okay, I mean, it's different.

2144
02:28:23,513 --> 02:28:31,736
[SPEAKER_09]: and I just think that, and Pain, if I'm not mistaken, isn't that a title that you buy on the PlayStation Network?

2145
02:28:31,936 --> 02:28:32,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

2146
02:28:32,836 --> 02:28:37,097
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of those games I think that you can now get on your PSP as well through the whole little... No.

2147
02:28:37,478 --> 02:28:38,078
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not?

2148
02:28:38,098 --> 02:28:38,138
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2149
02:28:38,258 --> 02:28:38,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was.

2150
02:28:39,478 --> 02:28:43,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know how some of those PlayStation Network games are coming on the PSP, like Flow was one of them, I know?

2151
02:28:44,840 --> 02:28:45,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2152
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:45,760
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

2153
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:46,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2154
02:28:47,021 --> 02:28:47,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Echo Chrome?

2155
02:28:47,961 --> 02:28:48,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2156
02:28:49,221 --> 02:28:51,142
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, anything else, Paradox Vincent, before we let you go?

2157
02:28:53,308 --> 02:28:54,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not all that much.

2158
02:28:54,910 --> 02:28:55,171
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2159
02:28:55,191 --> 02:28:55,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, have a good one, buddy.

2160
02:28:57,313 --> 02:28:57,654
[SPEAKER_09]: You too.

2161
02:28:57,674 --> 02:28:58,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for listening.

2162
02:28:58,234 --> 02:28:59,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time I see you, I'll break your arms.

2163
02:29:00,457 --> 02:29:01,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, ow.

2164
02:29:01,619 --> 02:29:02,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you do that?

2165
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:02,900
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mean.

2166
02:29:04,342 --> 02:29:05,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Zongief would do it.

2167
02:29:05,443 --> 02:29:05,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

2168
02:29:07,796 --> 02:29:09,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would someone threaten to break my arms?

2169
02:29:09,597 --> 02:29:12,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Now if my arms really do get broken, I have it on tape and I can sue.

2170
02:29:13,038 --> 02:29:13,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2171
02:29:14,499 --> 02:29:20,061
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2172
02:29:20,181 --> 02:29:22,422
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got time for maybe like one more call, I think.

2173
02:29:22,922 --> 02:29:23,742
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll probably do tonight.

2174
02:29:25,043 --> 02:29:25,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2175
02:29:26,843 --> 02:29:27,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2176
02:29:27,924 --> 02:29:28,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2177
02:29:29,364 --> 02:29:31,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, it's SSJ100 Matt from New York.

2178
02:29:31,565 --> 02:29:33,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hello SSJ100 Matt from New York.

2179
02:29:33,406 --> 02:29:33,786
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

2180
02:29:34,850 --> 02:29:35,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good, thanks.

2181
02:29:35,631 --> 02:29:37,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just thinking the other day.

2182
02:29:37,472 --> 02:29:38,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss New York City.

2183
02:29:40,274 --> 02:29:41,155
[SPEAKER_08]: You should definitely come.

2184
02:29:41,395 --> 02:29:42,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to come back and visit.

2185
02:29:42,636 --> 02:29:46,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know when I'm realistically going to make it happen because I'm very likely taking two trips to LA.

2186
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:53,064
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a very small chance I might be able to pull through and do BlizzCon after all, but more on that when I find out for sure.

2187
02:29:53,084 --> 02:29:53,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to jinx it.

2188
02:29:54,626 --> 02:29:56,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll see.

2189
02:29:57,208 --> 02:29:57,868
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2190
02:29:58,769 --> 02:30:02,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first off, I wanted to profess my love to Castle Crashers.

2191
02:30:04,853 --> 02:30:07,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everyone who has a 360 needs to get it now.

2192
02:30:08,198 --> 02:30:09,960
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it about Castle Crashers that you love?

2193
02:30:09,980 --> 02:30:11,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2194
02:30:11,242 --> 02:30:15,328
[SPEAKER_08]: It just brings back my old love of the classic beat-em-ups like Turtles in Time.

2195
02:30:15,909 --> 02:30:16,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying it's like that.

2196
02:30:16,910 --> 02:30:17,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Turtles in Time is great.

2197
02:30:17,872 --> 02:30:19,234
[SPEAKER_08]: It just reminds me of that.

2198
02:30:20,258 --> 02:30:31,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know though, the demo kind of got a little old for me, but I do like, I mean, I need to get the full version I think, because it does look like the little other aspects of upgrades and roleplay-esque elements they put in there look kind of cool.

2199
02:30:31,965 --> 02:30:36,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't want to review the game based off a demo alone, especially when everybody else is saying such wonderful things about it.

2200
02:30:36,688 --> 02:30:40,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I've been playing the game by myself, and I imagine it's the type of game that's much more fun with more people.

2201
02:30:41,291 --> 02:30:42,451
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hear online is broken.

2202
02:30:43,772 --> 02:30:44,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, online's broken.

2203
02:30:44,673 --> 02:30:46,814
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, I haven't really been playing online, um,

2204
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:49,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Mostly my friends have been bugging me to come play.

2205
02:30:49,311 --> 02:30:53,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually getting texted right now asking to come over and play it.

2206
02:30:55,715 --> 02:31:04,701
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, you know, it's lots of fun, and it's kind of a good party game if you kind of have a group of people who are all about it.

2207
02:31:06,007 --> 02:31:06,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, sure.

2208
02:31:06,948 --> 02:31:09,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rob D kind of sums up what I'm thinking.

2209
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:10,311
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in the chat right now.

2210
02:31:10,331 --> 02:31:13,994
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, I'm enjoying Castle Crashers, but I'm not really digging the combat gameplay.

2211
02:31:14,114 --> 02:31:18,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like the art style and the music, but I'm not liking the characters or the attacking.

2212
02:31:18,278 --> 02:31:24,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, the game's got a certain quirkiness about it that's very cool that piques my interest, but I don't know.

2213
02:31:24,924 --> 02:31:24,984
[SPEAKER_06]: The...

2214
02:31:26,065 --> 02:31:30,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Old School Ninja Turtles Arcade Game gameplay kind of got old a little while ago.

2215
02:31:30,347 --> 02:31:31,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know.

2216
02:31:31,067 --> 02:31:32,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's not completely fair to say.

2217
02:31:32,188 --> 02:31:33,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just one of these more fun and big groups.

2218
02:31:33,568 --> 02:31:35,229
[SPEAKER_08]: It got old when you wasted all your quarters on it.

2219
02:31:35,429 --> 02:31:36,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, true, true, very true.

2220
02:31:39,431 --> 02:31:43,573
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the other thing I wanted to talk about is, you guys kind of mentioned this before, is NHL 09.

2221
02:31:44,413 --> 02:31:44,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2222
02:31:45,954 --> 02:31:50,576
[SPEAKER_08]: And I managed to pick that up yesterday and I, you know what, I'm a big hockey fan.

2223
02:31:51,016 --> 02:31:53,998
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone listens to Under Sedation Live, I was calling about that.

2224
02:31:54,398 --> 02:31:54,598
[SPEAKER_08]: But,

2225
02:31:57,437 --> 02:32:03,479
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think this is, you know, one of the better hockey games because of the whole online interaction that they have.

2226
02:32:04,060 --> 02:32:06,040
[SPEAKER_06]: What's so special about the online interaction, real quick?

2227
02:32:06,301 --> 02:32:23,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, basically what it is, they kind of made hockey into an MMO where you create a player and you can take him on to a custom team where, you know, you can have a bunch of friends or like what we have with...

2228
02:32:24,804 --> 02:32:32,467
[SPEAKER_08]: All games, we've decided to make an all games team.

2229
02:32:32,927 --> 02:32:35,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Does everybody play as one character on the team, or how does it work?

2230
02:32:36,649 --> 02:32:39,830
[SPEAKER_08]: You play as one position on the team, or player.

2231
02:32:40,331 --> 02:32:43,512
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can either play goalie, you can play center, you can play any position.

2232
02:32:44,332 --> 02:32:46,873
[SPEAKER_08]: You can all play at once, and it's lots of fun.

2233
02:32:48,574 --> 02:32:51,755
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we're trying to rally every show...

2234
02:32:53,942 --> 02:32:55,103
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2235
02:33:16,795 --> 02:33:17,395
[SPEAKER_06]: NHL 09 Online

2236
02:33:42,110 --> 02:33:42,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

2237
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:44,371
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, we've got to let you go.

2238
02:33:44,491 --> 02:33:46,772
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start to wrap things up, but thanks so much for your call, okay?

2239
02:33:46,792 --> 02:33:47,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2240
02:33:47,812 --> 02:33:48,452
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, take care, buddy.

2241
02:33:50,933 --> 02:33:51,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

2242
02:33:51,713 --> 02:33:57,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, I think we've talked more about sports games tonight than we have in a year on Orange Lounge Radio, but that's okay.

2243
02:33:57,375 --> 02:33:59,996
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to give an equal opportunity to all games.

2244
02:34:01,156 --> 02:34:01,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2245
02:34:01,777 --> 02:34:04,998
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to wrap things up here, but I did get a private message I wanted to read here.

2246
02:34:05,058 --> 02:34:05,958
[SPEAKER_06]: James Patrick says...

2247
02:34:06,378 --> 02:34:07,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest IV Dragon Quest V

2248
02:34:30,316 --> 02:34:30,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob cheated.

2249
02:34:31,017 --> 02:34:31,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not cheat.

2250
02:34:31,497 --> 02:34:31,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

2251
02:34:31,798 --> 02:34:32,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I had help.

2252
02:34:51,417 --> 02:34:53,038
[SPEAKER_06]: It was officially sanctioned.

2253
02:34:53,458 --> 02:35:02,702
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't one of those things where, like, for a while, if you bought the game, you got the stupid thing free, the guidebook, which I always thought was a little weird, but I'm pretty sure you did through, like, Nintendo Power or something.

2254
02:35:03,723 --> 02:35:05,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... It's been a long time.

2255
02:35:06,764 --> 02:35:07,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

2256
02:35:08,185 --> 02:35:11,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even try Dragon Quest VIII.

2257
02:35:11,526 --> 02:35:12,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cool!

2258
02:35:12,447 --> 02:35:13,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest VIII is actually really fun.

2259
02:35:13,787 --> 02:35:14,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go back and beat it.

2260
02:35:14,908 --> 02:35:16,249
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually a lot, a lot of fun.

2261
02:35:17,069 --> 02:35:20,130
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like an old-school Super Nintendo role-playing game, but with, like, 3D graphics.

2262
02:35:20,991 --> 02:35:21,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2263
02:35:22,304 --> 02:35:22,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2264
02:35:24,408 --> 02:35:25,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not my thing, I guess.

2265
02:35:26,051 --> 02:35:29,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I still have to go back and finish Lost Odyssey, so, I mean, shit.

2266
02:35:29,857 --> 02:35:32,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not buying any more RPGs until I finish Lost Odyssey.

2267
02:35:34,195 --> 02:35:35,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So it may be a while.

2268
02:35:35,776 --> 02:35:44,662
[SPEAKER_04]: In all these Square Enix offshoot games, like Last Remnant and Infinite Undiscovery, I don't know if I should even try those.

2269
02:35:44,982 --> 02:35:51,186
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm being persuaded by a listener that Infinite Undiscovery may not be as bad as the first two hours make it seem.

2270
02:35:51,206 --> 02:35:54,288
[SPEAKER_06]: But boy, what a crappy way to start the game is just running from things.

2271
02:35:54,428 --> 02:35:56,710
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of frustrating.

2272
02:35:56,730 --> 02:35:57,531
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to try to...

2273
02:35:58,391 --> 02:36:02,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to suck it up and try to get a little further because I like the part that I played at Penny Arcade Expo and that bugged me.

2274
02:36:03,095 --> 02:36:04,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Why isn't the game as cool as I remember?

2275
02:36:05,016 --> 02:36:07,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it just that whole con?

2276
02:36:08,018 --> 02:36:12,322
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how games always seem better at a con because you're caught up in the moment of a convention?

2277
02:36:12,722 --> 02:36:14,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is exactly a good...

2278
02:36:15,965 --> 02:36:20,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Final Fantasy VIII, it was alright Like I can get on the internet

2279
02:36:46,214 --> 02:36:52,456
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in case you were wondering if Rock Revolution for the Wii is going to be good, apparently it's not.

2280
02:36:53,397 --> 02:36:55,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, throwing it out there.

2281
02:36:55,857 --> 02:37:09,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Kotaku actually got to preview the game at a Nintendo party last Friday, and apparently the game itself on the Wii, there is no peripheral support whatsoever, even if you happen to do own...

2282
02:37:10,422 --> 02:37:11,182
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2283
02:37:40,362 --> 02:37:40,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2284
02:37:41,022 --> 02:37:42,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of lame.

2285
02:37:43,103 --> 02:37:48,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, kind of on the topic of Nintendo here, they will not be at E4ALL.

2286
02:37:49,744 --> 02:37:53,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, apparently they just didn't want to go.

2287
02:37:53,625 --> 02:37:55,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not in their plans.

2288
02:37:55,925 --> 02:38:03,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember if I heard correctly that they're going to be showing off their games there anyways at like some Target booth or something.

2289
02:38:03,047 --> 02:38:06,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they actually sell games at this expo, which is weird.

2290
02:38:07,668 --> 02:38:21,972
[SPEAKER_04]: and Namco Bandai has said that they're planning on making more Xbox Live Arcade remakes of classic arcade games, much like they've done with Pac-Man Championship Edition and Galaga Legions.

2291
02:38:22,832 --> 02:38:26,413
[SPEAKER_04]: No word on exactly what they're planning, but more games.

2292
02:38:28,494 --> 02:38:33,896
[SPEAKER_04]: One suggestion, I guess, says that the team is working on a Pole Position remake, which is interesting.

2293
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:38,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And this little bit, I thought I'd throw this out for you, Rob.

2294
02:38:38,918 --> 02:38:46,121
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not exactly news, but there's a Dreamcast console available on PlayAsia.com that's the Hello Kitty Special Edition.

2295
02:38:46,361 --> 02:38:46,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

2296
02:38:47,022 --> 02:38:48,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually seen that in a store before.

2297
02:38:48,802 --> 02:38:49,483
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been out a while.

2298
02:38:49,743 --> 02:38:49,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2299
02:38:50,943 --> 02:38:51,804
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're hard to find.

2300
02:38:51,884 --> 02:38:52,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really hard to find.

2301
02:38:52,764 --> 02:38:53,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2302
02:38:53,844 --> 02:38:54,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's it.

2303
02:38:55,430 --> 02:38:58,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Team Ico is revealing a new game, The Queen, apparently.

2304
02:39:24,151 --> 02:39:24,792
[SPEAKER_04]: The Queen of what?

2305
02:39:25,092 --> 02:39:25,352
[SPEAKER_04]: England?

2306
02:39:25,712 --> 02:39:26,613
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just called The Queen.

2307
02:39:26,693 --> 02:39:27,014
[SPEAKER_04]: France?

2308
02:39:27,654 --> 02:39:31,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It says Tokyo Game Show teaser website calls the game Ico 3 The Queen.

2309
02:39:33,859 --> 02:39:34,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2310
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:36,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Which begs the question what was Ico 2?

2311
02:39:39,428 --> 02:40:04,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember a night go to maybe Shadow of the Colossus I don't know but apparently it's going to be Tokyo Game Show so that's kind of exciting and also my final thought is that I got to the bottom of why those Rock Band drum sets weren't out there apparently they released a press release on the 10th saying that they're coming later in the week I somehow missed that so that'd be why no one has them yet

2312
02:40:08,630 --> 02:40:15,559
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought for those of you in chatroom discussing this game right now is it's Treasure Hunter, not a thief.

2313
02:40:17,286 --> 02:40:18,706
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.

2314
02:40:18,906 --> 02:40:21,147
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to wrap up and get on out of here.

2315
02:40:22,047 --> 02:40:26,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Just let us say thank you very much for tuning into our show and downloading us and checking us out.

2316
02:40:26,288 --> 02:40:31,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, if you like what you hear, please tell two other people about our podcast because that's how we slowly spread the word.

2317
02:40:31,229 --> 02:40:32,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It's by word of mouth.

2318
02:40:32,410 --> 02:40:40,532
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not cool enough or rich enough to have broadcasting and a really big corporate website backing us, but that just lets you guys know that we're unfiltered.

2319
02:40:42,692 --> 02:40:43,513
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the real deal.

2320
02:40:43,613 --> 02:40:44,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Real gamers just like you guys.

2321
02:40:45,075 --> 02:40:54,203
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll hope you tune in live next week or in podcast if you can't join us live and talk more with us about games on the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

2322
02:40:54,223 --> 02:40:55,765
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next week, same time.

2323
02:40:56,125 --> 02:40:56,486
[SPEAKER_06]: See you then.

2324
02:40:56,886 --> 02:40:59,989
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2325
02:41:00,450 --> 02:41:03,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

02:41:04,113 --> 02:41:12,721

2327
02:41:13,241 --> 02:41:24,832

[SPEAKER_15]: See you next week!
