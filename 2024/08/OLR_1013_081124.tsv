9659	17121	Revisiting Duke Nukem 3D with developer commentary and even a fifth episode, in addition to the fourth episode I hadn't played until then, in the 20th anniversary edition was really cool.
17301	21082	And now, mine and so many others first shooter love, Doom, is getting similar treatment.
21202	27463	Yet another Doom compendium, including Doom 2, a new episode, and so much more, is whetting our appetites even before the Dark Ages itself.
27603	28683	This is how we rip and tear.
28963	33764	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell me about their story, and there's the week's gaming news.
33944	36125	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39147	42250	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42330	47355	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47535	50378	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live.
50879	53201	Once again, August the 11th of 2024 with episode number 1013 of our show.
57265	58006	Rob Roberts, Jason,
78446	79448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
96536	98779	Alright, I can use some more coffee.
98939	104286	I don't see how any week could be as good as a week where you went to California Extreme, but meh, you know, we move on.
104446	105487	We move on with our lives.
105988	108071	I'll actually have a really good week coming up.
108311	108611	Oh yeah?
108631	109432	What are you doing this week?
109472	111375	TwitchCon!
111655	114339	I was going to say, your next big convention is probably going to be TwitchCon, huh?
114881	115281	Frozen 3
137862	138563	I didn't even watch two.
162408	165189	It also has the distinction of being in Florida.
166410	172454	Not that I have a problem with Florida in general, but humidity is garbola.
172614	175316	We have listeners in Florida and the problem isn't you.
177214	183699	The problem is that I grew up on the Gulf Coast and no thank you Hey Loki, how are you doing?
199910	200731	I'm doing pretty good.
200811	201992	So would it be Florida?
204653	206695	That's what sounds like your third day at Disney World.
207115	207695	Florida.
209677	209957	Let's see.
210477	214060	S2100 Matt says, Loki is playing that roller coaster meme Rob and I like.
214160	214460	Yes.
215040	221765	One of my favorite YouTube videos of the Rihanna song that transitions into the Adele song when the coaster crashes.
222585	224106	It makes me laugh every single time.
224246	225007	Every single time.
225928	227529	Is that why you're doing Planet Coaster tonight?
227609	228409	Or is this like a D23 wink and nod?
230010	235511	No, it's because I'm working on roller coaster rides in my Minecraft stuff, and I don't know.
235711	239132	I couldn't think of anything else to put in there, because I don't play any other games.
240693	250475	Well, yeah, not so much Planet Coaster, but yeah, I've got footage I took of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and stuff like that.
251625	268516	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show and sometimes Bobby hangs out in our chat after and he says Broccoli Farm in Planet Coaster.
268897	276682	You know the week you weren't here Loki when you were sick and I was playing No Man's Sky I don't know if you know but we named our default planet Broccoli Farm.
277423	279368	after taking suggestions from chat.
279668	281794	Yes, we named the planet Broccoli Farm.
281874	282997	So there you go.
283017	283919	It's the best place on Earth.
284560	285823	The happiest place on Earth.
288081	288521	Perfect.
289221	289602	All right.
289622	293163	I have seen like I've seen the YouTube videos or whatever of likes.
294483	297604	This is not the only person that's like pulled that kind of joke on somebody.
298084	299525	This is like a smaller kid.
299785	303786	And that kid was very disappointed that he did not go to a broccoli farm.
305066	307027	Really wanted to go to a broccoli farm.
307387	310348	As far as makes me go ahead.
310508	312469	Think of the deep thoughts by Jack Handy.
314960	316761	I tell my friend, Disneyland burned down.
316821	317661	He cried and cried.
318141	321762	And then we decided to just go home.
323102	323823	So good, so good.
324703	327624	Yeah, Bobby says, I think one of the animals looked like broccoli.
327724	330144	Yes, that's how that whole thing started, is there was an animal like broccoli.
330164	335666	But I was going to say, as far as broccoli goes, honestly, there's lots of vegetables out there and broccoli's
337066	365030	actually one of my favorites like absolute favorite vegetables like to put in a salad or as a side like if usually if I get like a vegetable medley or you know how like you go to a diner and like the the side food is like vegetable mix spring mix or whatever like I usually pick out the broccoli first broccoli especially when you put butter salt or um the best is the old spaghetti factory mazithra stuff on the broccoli which at that point isn't really healthy who cares it's broccoli it's pretty good
365451	366836	I mean, like, I don't know.
367317	369505	We're usually mixing it with mac and cheese, so.
369766	370208	There you go.
370408	371653	You got to get the greens in somewhere.
374545	381470	And there you go.
381570	387514	We've now contractually fulfilled our obligation for Orange Lunch Foodio.
387714	387954	Thank you.
387974	389535	We can reset the counter now.
389635	390175	That's right.
390836	392057	Days without a food tangent.
392137	392477	Zero.
393017	394058	Look, here's the thing.
394118	395559	Yes, we're a video gaming podcast.
396039	401743	Before we get into the news, we actually have a breaking story to start us off tonight that broke just an hour ago before we went live.
403204	410206	This is a very, this is a, and we commented on this last week and probably the week before, this is an uncharacteristically slow news period.
410967	413107	And I'm not sure what's to blame for that.
413167	419589	You know, Bobby has thrown out a theory on his show about how there's less news outlets because of all the shitty things going on.
419789	422030	Like, you know, we're talking about Game Informer last week and all these other things.
422190	445230	Gamescom is right around the corner too though so that's true too and without an E3 Gamescom is kind of now I think where we're going to get some investments like we know we have Civ 7 is going to be a thing at Gamescom I also would argue I mean not to I think I do think Bobby is right to a point like I do think that is a part of it so this isn't to disagree with him I think it's multiple factors I think the other factor that maybe we're neglecting is the Olympics because
445549	447830	And I know that like, whatever, it's the Olympics.
447870	448770	It's not video games.
448950	454691	But the Olympics tends to monopolize entertainment media and entertainment reporting for the two weeks it's on.
454811	455692	Obviously not completely.
455952	457732	There's a lot of other things in the world to be talking about.
457772	461253	Like we could be talking about how awesome the Borderlands movie did at the box office.
462813	468655	But actually, this is not a good weekend to release movies either because the Olympics.
469315	479442	So I think the Olympics might play into that a little bit as well.
479562	481343	So it's just a weird period.
481703	484565	So yeah, to be honest, we don't have a lot of gaming news tonight.
484605	489168	There's some, and we'll get into it, but a food tangent is how we're going to fill the time tonight.
489388	491950	And we're encouraging listeners to eat broccoli.
492410	497193	I mean, what other gaming podcast out there encourages such health of their listeners?
498214	508605	Unless you're hyper-Orthodox, I will say, just because there are reasons that broccoli tops are frowned upon in Orthodox communities.
508805	510087	I'm not going to force you to eat anything.
512169	516754	What I want is, like, I want carrots.
517434	518676	Carrots are also good.
520482	527364	I've surely I've told the story on this show about how my mom had to take me to the hospital because my face started turning orange when I was young because I ate too many carrots.
527924	528864	Okay, Susan Day.
529344	529664	Right?
532565	533985	That literally happened to me.
534125	534465	I can't.
535245	536126	I ate too many carrots.
536526	538146	It's like the only vegetable I'd eat as a kid.
540246	546888	I've decided that putting shredded carrot or very finely diced carrot in my chicken salad is amazing.
548424	551946	PodCulture in chat says, raw carrots are awesome, cooked carrots are nasty.
551966	552506	100% agree.
552526	552786	100% agree.
553147	554968	You know what?
555748	560911	There are some ways to cook carrots that are really good roasted, blanched.
561091	561531	I'll give you that.
561571	562412	Okay, roasted, yeah.
562972	567995	Steam, like very steamed, while they're still a little firm, but it brings out that extra sweetness.
568996	570977	Pan fried where you caramelize them.
571653	573634	Yeah, butter and brown sugar.
573894	575295	Yes, make them completely unhealthy.
575956	576936	That actually just ruined it.
577897	578197	No.
578898	580699	And carrot cake, the best way.
581179	581700	Okay, all right.
581740	582840	On that note, no more food.
583141	585782	Okay, let's talk about what's going on in the gaming industry.
585822	588024	We're going to start off with some breaking news.
588084	596049	This just happened just before the show, during Bobby's show actually, is that Tango Gameworks, which of course was an Xbox studio that got closed,
596189	597489	Tango Gameworks Tango Gameworks
620495	622898	Tango Gameworks Tango Gameworks
639938	642119	Tango Gameworks Acclaimed IP Hi-Fi Rush
669352	670372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
688360	699753	hopefully most of the folks that worked on the game you know some had to resign before the game even came out but most of the folks that worked on the game will essentially be saved and a sequel at this point is all but guaranteed eventually pretty cool
700762	701963	So, very happy with that.
702864	709611	Also guaranteed probably some kind of collaboration of the IP with PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.
709651	717638	Now, I get that PUBG is not Fortnite, so we're not going to get cartoony things, but maybe a t-shirt, maybe a weapon inspired by something.
718680	722605	The last relevance PUBG ever had in my life was when I was considering getting that Dwight cosmetic for DBD.
732998	735460	Oh, I forgot DBD even did a crossover with that game.
735500	736000	That's funny.
736680	743185	Yeah, PUBG definitely seemed to fade to the background once Fortnite Battle Royale really kind of took over.
743245	747948	And I think, you know, being on mobile devices and tablets and all those places really kind of helped Fortnite.
748388	749609	So, yeah.
749949	751550	And PUBG is kind of more realistic.
751590	756033	So I think kids get more into Fortnite and parents aren't as, you know, weirded out with it.
756153	757634	So, you know, there's a variety of reasons.
757674	759976	But yeah, PUBG definitely hasn't been on my radar for some time.
760336	761337	But maybe that's...
761997	765160	Part of why we do strategical acquisitions to try to get back on the radar.
765660	766000	We'll see.
766701	768102	So more to come on this.
768162	771625	Again, this news is breaking during tonight's show, so we'll probably hear more throughout the week.
772525	775828	Let's move into what was originally going to be our kickoff topic tonight.
775888	779611	Loki, I'll turn it over to you because this is a game that your kids have subjected you to.
780051	781913	And so I'm very curious about your take on this.
783278	789701	I mean, it's nothing unheard of that we've heard many times already from Roblox.
789821	810910	Obviously, the consensus is that Roblox has some kind of predatory stuff with everything pretty much in Roblox, from the way it's monetized to the whole creator program and how they don't really pay out their creators, or at least they make you go through a bunch of hoops.
812331	827501	So essentially they're saying that because of all of this stuff, Turkey is banning the game right now due to possible child exploitation.
828539	834943	Although Roblox is apparently working with the country to try to bring the game back into that territory.
835784	843710	They said that due to content that could lead to the exploitation of children, they have banned the game in the country.
843730	846872	And this is coming from Turkey's Minister of Justice.
849854	854197	So yeah, I mean that's... Some of the comments made by...
857247	886063	their CEO too is just like yeah yeah like what was it like Stefano Corazza we talked about this before where it's like so I can be like a 15 year old in living in Indonesia living in a slum and then now with just a laptop I can create something make money and sustain my life okay that's not realistic but sure you can just paint that like how you're doing all this good but
888246	889249	No, you're not.
890232	893320	We don't trust corporations here on, you know, the internet.
893460	895807	So, sorry, just don't believe you.
898254	898755	Interesting.
898835	902157	I mean, I don't know enough about Roblox to know like what is going on.
902177	907802	I just know like, like, Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, like kids are able to build things in the ecosystem, right?
907822	909183	This would be like when you and I were 15.
910064	911445	And we were playing ZZT.
911865	916489	Essentially, this would be like if we could sell the things we were making in ZZT at 15 years old to a wider audience.
916849	919952	But essentially, we were well, we would have been getting paid in gift cards.
921069	921970	for the most part, right?
922010	933897	Well, I mean, yeah, they've got it where you can cash out, but it's like every step of the way, it's kind of like going through the GameStop trade-in process.
933997	934918	So it's like, okay...
936956	937757	You have a game.
938277	942839	They'll buy it off of you for whatever the used price is.
942859	945980	So there's a drop in the cost of that.
946080	949782	So Madden 22, they'll buy for 50 cents at this point.
949862	950843	For 50 cents, yeah.
950883	954984	But then if you want cash, then that's going to be another 30% off.
955044	955445	A nickel.
958846	982278	then there's the conversion fees and the platform fees and stuff like that and then there's even more percentage off and then it's like oh well then now I need to change these Roblox or Robux into cash and it's like even more of a percentage off so you have to in order to get paid out you have to make like three to six times the amount of money that's the minimum for that payout because of all that stuff but
983248	1007990	yeah so that could be a little bit predatory plus you know just the monetization that's in these games it's it's all over the place because it's kids making the well and corporations and then they try to also like get you to buy like movie tickets and stuff like that through this and they have the whole um Beetlejuice experience which is funny because like I think a lot of the people playing Roblox I mean aside from like really little kids are probably just like
1010839	1014661	I can smell this average gaming from a mile away.
1014681	1020324	They probably don't have that emotional connection to the original either because that original is what, like 30 years old at this point?
1020485	1021305	No, more.
1021445	1024127	God, it was a late 80s movie, like 35 years old at this point probably.
1025948	1034392	I mean, they're just bringing back these old franchises which, you know, certain people will find nostalgic but those people that would find it nostalgic aren't playing Roblox.
1035193	1035413	Yes.
1036633	1041596	Yeah, Roblox hasn't really broken through with the gamers above the age of 18, it seems.
1043176	1045337	No, not really, I don't think.
1045397	1048859	But that could change, you never know, because you may have kids that grow up on that.
1048879	1051360	I was going to say, as kids get older, yeah, of course.
1051621	1053582	So it's hard to say.
1054302	1060165	But yeah, certainly, I know my oldest son is kind of growing out of it a little bit, but he still plays stuff.
1060265	1061826	Depends on what his friends want to play.
1062066	1062206	Hmm.
1063442	1063882	Interesting.
1064242	1072586	He's been he's been he had me put my Xbox Series X in his room and he's been playing through Red Dead Redemption 2.
1072626	1075687	So, you know, kind of beat that before summer breaks over.
1077119	1078900	I'm surprised summer break isn't already over.
1079000	1080401	Some kids are already going back to school.
1081642	1082923	My youngest goes back tomorrow.
1082983	1085044	He starts high school on Thursday.
1085224	1085545	What?
1085725	1087466	Your youngest starts high school or your oldest?
1088747	1091609	I was going to say your youngest is not high school.
1091669	1092910	Your oldest starts high school.
1093090	1093950	Oh my gosh.
1094831	1095251	Wow.
1095952	1097993	I don't know how to feel about that.
1098493	1099634	We all should feel old.
1100114	1100555	Oh my gosh.
1100575	1101375	So that's class of 2028 then?
1101415	1101896	I think so, yeah.
1101916	1102136	Wow.
1106900	1117987	Alright, as we all slowly get older, let's take a moment to reflect on the last week and talk about how was your gaming week and the types of video games we've been playing this week.
1118707	1120028	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1122069	1124251	I played a lot of stuff actually, come to think of it.
1125451	1129754	I'm addicted to one of those Suica games called Fruit Salad.
1130695	1132436	You know, the fruit combining game?
1132856	1135738	Yes, I think Alan is playing the same one.
1136397	1140980	I have another one that's called My Suica on my phone, so I have one to go with me.
1142881	1146042	I've also been playing a Mahjong game on the go.
1147583	1150585	I've been playing, of course, Dead by Daylight.
1150705	1155548	They've extended the 2v8 play, which is what I will be doing tonight while it lasts.
1156608	1158289	You know, be fun to have people join.
1160865	1189293	I definitely played a bunch of Baldur's Gate 3 or else I've been calling it Vampire Spawn Dating Sim I put a lot of effort in over the last few days I'm still kind of taking it slow I pick it up when I'm in the mood for it Also, Cult of the Lamb has new DLC coming out so I'm going to be playing that coming up in a couple days
1191844	1193125	God, there's other stuff on my list.
1193165	1195287	Stuff I know is playing Polya.
1195327	1198049	That's kind of like my chill laid-back game.
1199631	1211602	I also beat the original Japanese PlayStation release for Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight, also known over here as Symphony of the Night.
1213224	1215165	I was playing an English translation patch.
1215526	1222371	I don't know what it is, but the PlayStation version seems a little slightly harder than the Saturn version.
1223852	1224373	Excuse me.
1224713	1226394	And I'm getting over a sinus infection.
1226435	1227195	I'm on the tail end.
1230098	1230918	At least it wasn't COVID.
1233480	1236743	Also, oh gosh, I know I played some other stuff.
1238605	1241127	I opened Fortnite for a half second and then closed it again.
1242580	1267553	you know sort of like ah no better not um gosh I know that there was a couple other things that I was playing but I kind of can't be bothered to think of what it was oh yeah and Avatar um my new DLC is out so kind of playing a little bit of that here and there nice okay all right well we'll go over to Loki how was your gaming week
1269102	1287534	um it's been mostly just editing um and working on just the theme park stuff so I finished my first attraction which I should have a video I hear very soon um as I finish editing that so I made a dropper ride and that was fun kind of like drop zone and um
1288246	1293509	and I have a crazy mouse that's going to be, or wild mouse that's in the next episode.
1294289	1296510	So I'm just slowly working through theme park stuff.
1296931	1297451	That's fine.
1297471	1299452	What else happened this week?
1300293	1303694	Oh, I put a short out for the Roscomber Build-by-Build event.
1304195	1306856	So I had that with all the judges' comments that they made.
1310058	1311479	And gosh, what else?
1312899	1313260	I don't know.
1313700	1315181	More behind-the-scenes stuff, I'm sure.
1315721	1315901	Um,
1316991	1322034	The Dragon Fight, and the Frigid SMP thing, which I still have to edit that stuff, too.
1322114	1322674	There's so much.
1322794	1328238	Oh, and I did an interview with Inside MCC Live Show again.
1328398	1336102	So they did an interview about a year ago for MCC Rising 2, and they used a follow-up, where are they now type of thing.
1336262	1337423	So I did that today.
1337543	1338063	Oh, that's fun.
1338083	1338584	That was fun.
1340145	1340445	Oh, good.
1340705	1341025	That's it.
1341786	1342046	Awesome.
1343025	1343626	My game of the week.
1344046	1347188	You know I love me some Final Fantasy XIV, so I played a little bit of that, of course.
1347328	1347948	What else is new?
1348769	1355913	I finally almost have my second battle job, because I have a botanist and alchemist at level 100, along with Sage.
1356614	1358595	But my second job, Astrologian, is almost 100.
1358815	1361537	And then I'm going to probably... I need to finish off Bard.
1361897	1363278	I really want to get into tanking.
1363318	1364379	I think I'm ready to do that.
1364479	1367501	So I'm going to polish off Gunbreaker and do that one next.
1368081	1369402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1387577	1391623	This had nothing to do with Shane's influence because he loves Pokemon.
1391643	1392624	He always tries to get me to play it.
1392925	1394066	He actually had nothing to do with this.
1394146	1395768	It was one of those things.
1395949	1401817	Actually, I would say it was me playing Nintendo World Championship on the Switch when that came out.
1402177	1404220	It kind of made me realize, I was like, I really...
1405001	1406042	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1422378	1426200	I used Sprigatito as my starter, and I think I got like two, two, two.
1426260	1428301	I think I did two of everything, and that was about as far as I got.
1428701	1430882	The second time I played, I didn't get very far at all.
1430962	1435123	I did like the intro and maybe a little bit past that with Quaxley, and that was about as far as I got.
1435564	1443227	So now I'm on my third playthrough, and yes, this time I said, all right, it's Fuecoco's time to shine because I tried the other two and didn't...
1443607	1445569	Voicoco is my starter this time.
1447271	1448793	Shane said that surprised him the most.
1448833	1450075	He thought I'd go back to Spriggetito.
1450115	1451957	I'm like, no.
1452277	1454740	Logically, I've got to use the one I haven't used yet.
1455101	1456863	Voicoco has been my starter this time.
1457644	1461228	I am two star bases away.
1461803	1464546	Three Titans and three gyms, I think, at this point.
1465406	1471893	So I'm a little further and really probably going to finish my fourth gym after the show tonight is where I'm at.
1471933	1473995	So that's been, yeah, that's been pretty fun.
1474375	1476617	PodCulture in chat says, Weed Kitty for the win.
1476737	1477058	Oh, yeah.
1477398	1479840	Sprigatito is still my fave because, you know, cats.
1479961	1482943	But I will say, Fuey Coco is actually a really...
1483684	1489247	like powerful starter because there's a lot of stuff at the beginning of the game where fire comes in very handy.
1490168	1492369	So I've been building out a pretty good party.
1492509	1497132	I think the party I've been using right now is, let's see if I can remember, Crocolore, right?
1497152	1497793	The evolution.
1498993	1503296	Mudbray, the horse ground type, very powerful.
1503536	1507458	I subbed that one in for a jump pluff I was using.
1507499	1508639	I'm going to fuck up some of these names, sorry.
1509120	1509480	I'm not...
1510000	1511021	Tinkertuff Tinkertuff
1534438	1540921	Sinisty, Sinisty, the little teacup, like I'm playing with something from Beauty and the Beast, one of the singing teacups.
1541662	1542282	I love that.
1542462	1543263	I've been doing that one.
1543343	1545824	And then I can't remember my six Pokemon type.
1546824	1547785	I can't remember the six one.
1549166	1549686	Oh, uh,
1551667	1554170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1568530	1573032	from before, just because having a ground party member made a lot of sense.
1573052	1580255	And I just caught a Bramble, which is a ghost grass type, so I might sub out my Sinistee for that.
1580395	1597263	As much as I love the teacup, like I just love that Pokemon, it's so funny, it might make more topping sense, or it might make more sense as type, typing, coming out on top of the typing to do Bramble instead, or whatever that Pokemon's name is.
1597823	1597923	So...
1599079	1600421	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1614557	1615518	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1635271	1639433	that some of the celebrities from the Lord of the Rings trilogy are going to be at DragonCon.
1639473	1641313	Elijah Wood is going to be there.
1642094	1643574	Dominic Monaghan is going to be there.
1643974	1644535	Billy Boyd.
1644955	1652758	So there's lots of... The list for this year's DragonCon is pretty damn amazing.
1653778	1657520	Check out DragonCon.org if you haven't seen it yet and I hope to see you there Labor Day weekend for sure.
1658584	1661426	All right, let's move on into some gaming news.
1661566	1665589	Let's go over to Loki with our first headline tonight.
1666370	1678940	Yeah, so not a huge surprise, but of course, with the whole Borderlands movie coming out, a lot of folks are asking Randy Pitchford in part of different interviews promoting the movie.
1680021	1681882	Hey, are you working on another Borderlands game?
1681922	1682402	And of course...
1683516	1686979	Yes, they are obviously working on another Borderlands game.
1687739	1696266	They said that there are multiple projects in development thanks to a leadership cluster which drives a project from cradle to grave.
1697167	1698028	Okay, that...
1698436	1699676	What's that mean exactly?
1700976	1707678	So with this approach, we're able to spin up multiple things, including a new Brothers in Arms game, which has been in development for a while.
1708678	1710238	But we're not ready to talk about it.
1711238	1714679	Also, we're working on every IP.
1714719	1718700	I mean, we just launched Homeworld 3, and there's still work going on there.
1719060	1722580	And there's Risk of Rain, and there's Duke Nukem, and there's more.
1723721	1725221	They're making another Duke Nukem game?
1727409	1753111	okay how brave I'm sure I mean we're far enough away from Duke Nukem Forever where I think the the the franchise deserves another shot yeah yeah I think if you reboot it and you can get like some of those people that were making those new um oh gosh basically kind of like uh the whole
1756898	1775636	and some of the other games that are using the build engine but kind of making it a little bit more modern I think would be really cool to see like a new build version of Duke Nukem just keep it like kind of retro like that but eh check it out but eh
1777734	1778074	Yeah.
1778955	1780375	Duke Nukem Forever is really bad.
1781356	1783857	It is really bad.
1784537	1787478	Some game franchises have a stinker amongst them.
1787518	1788039	It happens.
1788259	1788819	So we'll see.
1788839	1790140	We'll give it a chance when it comes out.
1790520	1797143	But as far as Borderlands goes, it's nice that the franchise is getting some good news this week because the movie hoofed
1798957	1799677	Fuck good.
1799977	1800798	I didn't see the movie.
1800878	1801478	Full disclosure.
1801618	1802358	I did not see the movie.
1802458	1806499	But I have friends that went and saw and none of them had anything nice to say about it.
1807039	1810280	And like these are friends that can appreciate like a bad movie like Showgirls bad.
1811541	1813021	Not hearing good things about Borderlands.
1813041	1814541	And apparently, you know what?
1814722	1819823	If you want to say I'm full of shit, that's fine too because the box office receipts not looking good.
1819883	1820583	I think it made what?
1820603	1820943	8 million?
1821203	1824804	Yeah, somewhere between 8 and 9 million this weekend on a $120 budget. $115,000.
1827839	1829880	or $150 million budget.
1830360	1831740	That I didn't even know it was coming out.
1832561	1836542	Well, number one, why do you put a big movie out during the Olympics?
1836862	1843925	You know, like again, I mean, I know not everybody watches the Olympics, but enough people do where it's going to that's going to bite into it a little bit.
1843965	1846086	But it's just I'm just surprised.
1846246	1849047	And don't forget the big, the big, big, big, big one.
1849247	1849447	Hmm.
1850154	1851095	Deadpool and Wolverine.
1851135	1851475	Hello.
1851495	1852436	It's not going to compete.
1852536	1853497	Well, that's true, too.
1853577	1856999	That movie is doing really good business and has really good word of mouth.
1857780	1858901	And you know what?
1858921	1861243	The biggest R-rated movie yet, right?
1861643	1867367	Because I think I heard it made more money than The Passion of the Christ, which up until date was the biggest R-rated movie.
1868829	1870590	Instead, we have Marvel Jesus.
1872611	1873492	But I'm not going to spoil.
1873652	1874153	No spoilers.
1875325	1899766	so yeah so there's that uh E3VL in chat points out Alien Romulus next week yeah and that's now going to be after the Olympics and I think there's oh my god I think there's probably more people interested in that um so I think you guys have no idea how excited I am for Alien Romulus yeah what do you think about the you know the well I maybe I shouldn't be talking about leaks sorry but the character's been leaked for DBD as an Ellen Ripley legendary
1901351	1901992	Okay, cool.
1902072	1903293	Yeah, I didn't know.
1903713	1904114	Surprise!
1904354	1911981	I mean, I don't really... I know a few things about the movie already because I've been following alien theory.
1912061	1916385	Like, I think the main character is... I don't want to spoil what I know, though.
1916665	1917285	Okay, that's fair.
1919524	1922386	TigerClaw on chat says, I've been seeing a lot of commercials for Wicked.
1922466	1924187	That's going to get me back in a movie theater.
1924348	1926709	I couldn't tell you the last time I saw a new movie.
1927330	1934095	Of course, with the horror stuff, I see Colton horror and those type of niche movies all the time, but I don't really get out and see new movies very often.
1934135	1935656	Come with me and see Deadpool.
1935856	1938158	I will be seated for Wicked.
1938218	1939258	Do I need to see the others?
1939278	1941000	Because I've literally never seen a Deadpool movie.
1941380	1943401	I haven't seen a Marvel movie since the first Avengers movie.
1944082	1944662	Not really.
1944682	1945063	Not really.
1945543	1947024	There's some jokes, but not really.
1947084	1953190	Yeah, there's a few characters' appearances, but honestly, they're all so good.
1953610	1957013	They're all... I love them all.
1957393	1958114	They are perfect.
1958134	1963418	For someone who read Deadpool ever since he was in New Mutants back in the... What was it?
1963458	1965140	The late 90s?
1965340	1965981	Early 90s?
1966301	1967202	The olden times.
1968242	1971966	Yeah, the olden times when Liefeld actually was drawing the characters.
1973308	1975469	Oh, and the Liefeld jabs were perfect.
1975549	1976930	I'm just going to say that right now.
1977891	1985816	Can I just say I'm laughing because with Loki's green screen effect, he was reaching behind him to grab something, I don't know, like a soda or something, and it looked like he was smacking the people going into his park.
1986576	1990279	It looked like he was reaching behind and smacking the people and like, get out.
1992260	1993140	Get out of my park.
1994661	1995482	We're closed.
1997833	2004896	It's like Cartman in the theme park where he bought the theme park but only allowed himself to go on the rides.
2006376	2007257	That's great.
2007777	2011858	QuestBuster in chat says the Deadpool films are a lot of fun even if you have no idea what the comics are.
2012378	2014319	Generally, I like Ryan Reynolds a lot.
2014539	2019081	I did not like his sitcom he had on ABC years ago, the Pizza Place thing.
2019501	2023162	I did not like that show at all, but I generally think he's pretty funny.
2023702	2025023	So, yeah.
2026192	2027993	Yeah, I need to see Deadpool at some point.
2028073	2033095	I'm just your super uncool uncle that plays Final Fantasy XIV all day.
2034135	2034355	Bob.
2034755	2035016	What?
2035736	2036356	You're coming over.
2037757	2038977	Oh, I can play pinball at least.
2040258	2043179	And watch, you're coming over for a Deadpool movie a night.
2044127	2044367	All right.
2044387	2047270	Well, hopefully we can squeeze it in before DragonCon.
2047290	2048492	Otherwise, it's going to be like a month.
2048872	2050233	But yeah, we'll have to make it work.
2051855	2052155	All right.
2053036	2053597	Let's move on.
2053657	2055459	Let's get back into gaming news.
2056019	2061565	And so I mentioned earlier there was one other game I played this week, and it's something that just came out.
2061685	2065849	It is a new enhanced version of Doom and Doom 2.
2066710	2075632	So yeah, QuakeCon 2024 happened this past weekend, and usually there is something happening with Bethesda's various IPs, ZeniMax specifically.
2076493	2081874	It's been Quake the last couple of years, but Doom and Doom 2 is being re-released.
2081994	2086255	It's been spotted in a new Steam listing, but they have come out and acknowledged this.
2086635	2089696	You can also get this on the Xbox ecosystem because it's on Game Pass.
2089716	2092197	That's how I played it, actually, was PC Game Pass.
2093218	2097562	So it is now using the games running on the KEX engine.
2097942	2102947	That's an engine that was used in other re-releases that ZeniMax has done over the years.
2103048	2106371	Doom 64, Quake, and Quake 2 when they did those.
2106691	2115300	So yeah, even though they just re-released Doom and Doom 2, it feels like within this latest console era, because I know they had the version that supported mods, they are doing it again.
2115620	2116760	Here's the really cool news.
2117060	2120901	If you owned one of those older versions, you're getting it upgraded.
2121081	2125642	So you're not like, it's not like, I can't sit here and say, oh, it's a scheme to get you to buy it again.
2125662	2127143	Because the nice thing is, it is upgraded.
2127383	2132684	And it includes, if you want to play those original versions, those are there as well.
2132804	2135065	So can't bitch about that.
2135145	2136585	They're doing a lot of the right things here.
2137085	2143189	What's also really cool about it is that now they have cross-platform deathmatch up to 16 players.
2143649	2152855	There is a brand new soundtrack in the game, and I was playing, it's very loud, very metal, as it ought to be, very like Dragon Force-esque, but
2155376	2157337	It's what you'd want.
2157638	2159218	So I was very happy with that.
2159619	2167983	And then multi-threaded rendering supporting up to 4K resolution because you know Doom is the game you wallies wanted to see in 4K.
2170137	2171038	I really can't bitch.
2171058	2172179	So that's really cool.
2172339	2173060	And it actually has...
2185652	2186433	Other content.
2186453	2195800	So on the menu, when you go in and pick, you can pick original Doom, Doom 2, but you could also pick other campaigns that they've, I believe, released before.
2195840	2200283	But there's a brand new one, Legacy of Rust, which is a new episode for Doom 2.
2200523	2205007	It's actually been made by ID Software, Night Dive Studios, and Machine Games.
2205027	2207729	And they actually have new monster types in that, which is pretty cool.
2208149	2211350	So yeah, if you're a Doom fan, this release is pretty cool.
2211550	2219593	I did play it for a hot minute, and I will tell you, one thing I noticed, it runs fast.
2220534	2221054	Fast.
2221254	2231918	Like, I was playing, I don't usually get motion sick or any of that stuff playing games, but when I was playing Doom and going full speed, I had to go like, whoo, whoo, this is...
2232537	2261157	this is a lot I'm surprised I remember as many codes as I do so you know I've never tried to use some of those codes on this new version I don't see why they wouldn't work though they should I was also saying had the Wolfenstein level map 31 it was different on one of the versions I think the Game Boy Advance version was a different map but eh
2263252	2291188	Xbox had a specific map too in one of them so yeah I'm actually really amazed that I remember any of them and then there was like the secret level IDCLEV19 I think I used to love when people would make their own custom maps and that shit and I know that had to be something Loki did at some point in his life was making custom maps for either Wolfenstein or Doom Quake was the big one though I loved Quake
2292372	2298393	I did not for Doom because I could never really get Doom to run on my PC at the time.
2299914	2307855	But I did do Wolf of the Sun maps and we made Wolf of the Sun like re-textured things.
2308695	2312056	But I did do that in the build engine with Duke Nukem 3D.
2312256	2313696	We did make custom maps.
2314057	2315637	That's cool.
2315677	2318217	The one I can remember is it was a water park.
2319138	2320298	Water park, kind of.
2320458	2320878	Yeah.
2321570	2335896	It had, like, a lot of moving water, and there was a part that had a really long drop because there was a button to lower the map, and there was a raise the map, and there was no... Oh, that was the thing in Duke Nukem, too, in the map editor.
2336056	2336376	Yes.
2336636	2345400	Yeah, there was no limit, so, like, I would just put a paperweight down on the page down button or something like that, go have lunch, then come back, and then I have a five-minute drop now.
2345520	2348081	Yeah, I remember making... Which I thought it was cool at the time.
2349803	2355912	I remember making a Duke Nukem multiplayer map that started where the spawns were just a giant drop.
2356292	2359016	And you fell in the water or something, so you didn't get damaged.
2359717	2363763	So every time you respawned, you had to wait for like a 30-second drop to get back.
2363783	2364903	Back in the match, it was pretty fun.
2364923	2381630	And then at the very end, for no reason, I don't know, I just thought that was funny, but then there's a super fast elevator going up, but if you hit the elevator just wrong, you could just die from how fast it's going, it would just crush you, and try to get spiky ceilings to crush you.
2381830	2385112	That didn't really work that well, but yeah, it was fun.
2385854	2388335	I've got cartridges laying around for the SNES version and Doom 64.
2402984	2405125	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2430001	2435827	Performance improvements and rumble support if you have the all new controller for it.
2436107	2441072	There is a custom chip that helps to replicate what the Super FX chip did.
2441452	2442153	So that's pretty cool.
2442173	2444235	There's a standard edition and a collector's edition.
2444615	2446517	And the collector's edition is limited.
2446877	2448819	It's only going to have, of course, 666 copies.
2451041	2453543	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2474585	2476846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2504741	2514754	So, you know, we have been talking about the games we wanted Capcom to re-release for an age, and they have a goal.
2514774	2517678	And I think it's important to all of our voices, you know?
2518379	2522444	They want to make all of their old fighting games available again.
2525566	2537270	Matsumoto Shuhei revealed that they were trying to bring everything back to modern platforms so that they could make longtime fans and newcomers feel happy about it.
2537650	2538470	All of the classics.
2541711	2548393	There was the Marvel vs. Capcom fighting collection, the Arcade Classics.
2548474	2551394	It's going to be out on PlayStation, Switch, and Steam.
2554261	2561405	that has six fighting games and an arcade brawler and then the SNK vs. Capcom SVC Chaos release that we talked about before.
2563547	2573112	But the fighting collection will be missing Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and we won't have any Tatsunoko vs. Capcom on it.
2573312	2582098	I mean, if they really want to go all out, we need a Justice Gakuen series or as we had at Rival Schools.
2583158	2584900	We need Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
2584940	2585841	We need Red Earth.
2586081	2588102	We need just all of them.
2589063	2591405	I'm looking forward to it.
2592366	2598671	And honestly, I do super love Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
2600073	2601074	But I don't know.
2601274	2602915	I like some of the obscure ones as well.
2609481	2609701	Hello?
2609721	2609821	Hello?
2610874	2612114	Sorry, I was talking when I was muted.
2612154	2612355	Sorry.
2612715	2615736	S200 Matt in chat says, would love some Capcom versus SNK 2.
2616276	2618857	And yes, a big, strong agree with that one as well.
2619537	2623939	Dr. Suya does, you know, level set expectations saying, I mean, we're just getting Marvel 2.
2624639	2627120	I know folks want the Rival Schools Project Justice games.
2627160	2628801	There's definitely still stuff left to do.
2629361	2629541	So.
2630501	2637924	Would love to see both of those brought up for like modern graphics, you know, give them like the Street Fighter 5 treatment, you know.
2638064	2638244	Mm-hmm.
2639554	2640254	That'd be pretty cool.
2641795	2644097	All right, let's move on to our next story, Loki.
2647759	2650821	I'm glad I'm not the only one that forgets the mute button when I'm trying to type.
2651815	2652855	Sorry.
2653376	2662419	No, we got an announcement now from Saber Interactive and Paramount Pictures that Quiet Place, the road ahead, is now launching October 17th.
2662719	2670142	Apparently, I didn't even realize the game was announced back in 2021, but it's a story-based Quiet Place game.
2670482	2674484	It looks creepy, but yeah, we'll have to see what it ends up...
2675664	2676805	If it's going to be good or not.
2676825	2682149	It's going to be coming out, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.
2682229	2688813	It's going to cost $30, which is a little bit more digestible than a AAA $70 game.
2690475	2692116	Yeah, curious to see what that looks like.
2692136	2699501	I wonder if that's going to be kind of timed for the streaming release of the new Quiet Place movie, because I think that just came out.
2700738	2705621	yes it was like a quiet place which by the way I've never seen the movies am I missing out are they good movies?
2706981	2728913	I've seen the first one they're pretty good and then yeah I think there's an actual quiet place part 3 coming too if I remember what I read right it's funny these feel more like you know how there was like a whole bunch of movies that they kept like kind of inserting into the um oh god what was that um
2730407	2758243	that found footage alien movie um oh I can't remember now um oh Cloverfield uh yeah there's remember how there's a bunch of movies that like kind of felt like uh getting shoehorned into like the Cloverfield type stuff the Quiet Place actually feels like it should be part of that universe but it's not it's kind of like it's got it's own lore so they've had like two movies already that are sequels and now they just released a prequel movie
2758783	2759063	Day 1, Day 0
2780299	2780599	I don't know.
2780659	2783622	I read a lot of internet, but I don't always remember it correctly.
2785463	2789066	And people lie on the internet, too, is a very important thing to see.
2789186	2795931	I saw on Facebook today, I saw a very well-done but fake Friends reunion trailer.
2796091	2799614	Like, they went to the extent to cut all of the actors out of other movies.
2799874	2803097	And I could tell right off the bat because I was like, oh, that's Courtney Cox in Scream.
2803397	2805138	That's a shot from the Scream movie, from Scream 5.
2805579	2807060	Like, this isn't real.
2808761	2816025	I think they used AI to put them all in a scene together where they looked like they were at a funeral for Chandler or whichever.
2816246	2817386	Yeah, Chandler was the one that passed away.
2819528	2821109	But the whole thing was super cut.
2821269	2823410	It looked like a legit presentation on Max.
2823670	2829054	But it's all a lie because the minute you kind of pick out, no, that's Scream 5, then that's it.
2829774	2831055	You know it's fake.
2832356	2835438	People lie on the internet and they go at great lengths to lie.
2836198	2836418	Mm-hmm.
2836438	2836598	Mm-hmm.
2861474	2866339	and doing them all with AI and seeing how disastrous they turn out.
2866779	2867300	Interesting.
2867320	2868861	They're hilarious.
2869021	2879572	There is a... Crap, I can't remember the name that had... Perfect Strangers.
2880558	2886983	They did a Perfect Strangers one that is actually so terrible.
2887123	2888364	All the ones they did are so terrible.
2888484	2890826	It was called Perfect Strangers and something else.
2891527	2892528	Wow.
2892848	2898793	But they're done that way on purpose and show exactly how bad generative AI is.
2899013	2899693	Now I've seen it.
2899793	2906819	It had nothing to do with AI, but I saw a different one for Perfect Strangers where they recut it to make it look like a slasher flick.
2906999	2907920	And that was funny.
2910441	2914924	I like when they recut things to make them look like the wrong genre.
2915464	2921727	I've seen them do Terrifier to look like a comedy and that type of stuff is great.
2922448	2926290	I think there was one for Hereditary that looked like a comedy too and I don't even know how they got away with that.
2926350	2928371	Did you see that one?
2928391	2931552	Because you know I love both of those movies.
2931572	2932333	Hereditary and
2932955	2940983	TigerClaw says it wasn't AI generated because one of the things I have seen are fake movie trailers that's generated by AI, trailers for movies that don't exist.
2941023	2942744	This particular thing I saw used both.
2953354	2958800	It was definitely like... And I could tell there was this scene where it looked like they were all at a funeral and the heads had been imposed.
2959241	2960362	Maybe one of them was real.
2960382	2962264	It was probably from another movie that one of them started.
2962985	2964527	But the heads were definitely superimposed.
2964547	2965848	You can just tell like that, right?
2966349	2966689	And then...
2968671	2975856	Again, it was the – but they would super cut in the actors in other movies in scenes that looked like it could play into this.
2976297	2983322	And so there were scenes of Courtney Cox from Scream 5 and probably Scream 6 where I was – but that was the giveaway for me.
2983442	2984523	I was like, oh, that's from Scream.
2984543	2986304	That's not from anything else.
2986884	2987065	So –
2987825	2989166	Anyway.
2989347	2994672	It was called, the channel, by the way, is Rocky Bergen, B-E-R-G-E-N.
2994972	2998196	It's absolutely hilarious and really terrible.
2999181	3000302	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3021100	3049434	But Game Informer is, of course, you know, had its fans And they are trying to preserve the legacy of the Game Informer magazine online Because as you know, the whole site got shut down The whole damn archives and all the articles, gone The social media, gone I mean, we went into it last week I don't need to dredge up all that Because, you know, obviously it left a bad taste in our mouth So trying to look at the good news out of this Retromags.com
3050254	3055495	I think I've seen this site before, but I'm glad I'm reminded that this is a thing because this is a lot of fun.
3055975	3064777	Retro Mags hosts community submitted scans of classic video game magazines, and they have put a huge archive of Game Informer issues live.
3065198	3069118	They have right now issue one all the way to issue 260 from December of 2014.
3071759	3072640	So that's pretty cool.
3072680	3076365	So if you want to go back and look at the legacy of Game Informer, that's a great way to do it.
3076725	3084574	Thank you to Retro Mags, who is interested in preserving gaming history when GameStop are being a bunch of fucking assholes about it.
3084754	3086757	So specifically the CEO.
3086917	3088999	Specifically the CEO.
3089580	3117734	specifically, asshole I'm wondering though if they're doing this as some sort of tax write-off purpose because Cartoon Network or Adult Swim just recently had, I think it was Cartoon Network had, when they pulled all that stuff, they also wiped the entire website of things as well so that it can't be searched anymore I'm wondering if they have to do that so they can write it off as a loss and get a tax break on it
3118482	3120605	which shouldn't be allowed anyways.
3121185	3127854	If I have all these assets and I just throw them in the trash, I shouldn't get to write that off.
3128014	3133801	And I've said this before on the show because I've said it about these movies that keep getting taxed right off, which
3134662	3136183	Borderlands probably should have been.
3136283	3137743	But here's the thing.
3137823	3146187	When companies write these off and they use it to write off their public debt, what they are using to write off their public debt then should become public property.
3146587	3147948	That's how it ought to work.
3148028	3152430	So these Game Informer magazines, it ought to become public domain at this point.
3152870	3155351	I mean, we all know it isn't going to work that way, but it should.
3155371	3161574	If the taxpayers are paying for their loss, then it should be ours.
3162486	3163407	DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura
3188906	3195251	Sonic Generations, a game that is, I would say, pretty well loved.
3197633	3206600	Well, it's going to be withdrawn from sale as a standalone title.
3207181	3216549	But what's going to happen is that they are going to be including it with bundles.
3222146	3237565	especially since it's part of the Sonic X Shadow Generations game I don't like necessarily but this is what they're saying is their way of preserving the title
3239683	3242786	It's going to be part of bundles on Steam and Xbox.
3243827	3253536	And if you already own the copy, you can still download it and that the mods on the Steam version will not be affected, is what they said.
3254817	3255598	But I don't know.
3256339	3258040	And this is happening on September 9th.
3259462	3261224	We need to remember what else happened on September 9th.
3263452	3283962	uh a video game system yes that speaking of politics apparently it came out that our democratic vice presidential nominee was a dreamcast person which i think is pretty cool i mean yeah there's as if you needed another reason he's also gonna help us do our house chores if the internet is to be believed probably
3286593	3288714	I don't, yeah, Jamie, I'm kind of with you.
3288754	3291374	Something about this feels very off.
3291514	3296135	Like, I'm glad the game is continuing and is being preserved.
3296736	3298376	It does seem a little shady.
3298516	3302817	I mean, but I understand there comes a point where you're literally not selling copies of this game anymore.
3303197	3307999	And maybe it does cost more to keep the lights on, you know, and this is their way of doing it.
3308699	3310119	It just feels weird.
3310139	3311259	But are there servers?
3311779	3313480	Are there online servers for the game?
3315197	3328256	I think this was like their replacement for like an equivalent yeah yeah, I guess there is that I mean, I don't know thank god I have it in my library
3328919	3333284	It's just like gaming corporation being corporate about stuff.
3333564	3340973	It's like, at this point, it's like, of course you're going to corporate, because of course, you know, this is what you do, this is what corporations do.
3341514	3343556	They be corporating all over the place.
3343576	3344938	They be corporating all over.
3346599	3347541	But it's just...
3348689	3349170	I don't know.
3350571	3354074	I just have to assume any decision corporations make are evil.
3354154	3362022	So, you know, let's see what nefarious purpose this is meant to cause or be for.
3362462	3362803	I don't know.
3364214	3368676	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, you just have to spend $60 to buy the one game you want.
3369037	3373259	Plus, side, you get Sonic Spinball for the 12th time from various collections.
3373499	3374919	Oh my god, that's so true.
3374939	3377541	To go along with the 12 actual copies I actually own.
3377621	3381923	Yeah, to go along with your Doom 2 re-release and your Yars Revenge re-release.
3381943	3387085	Like, just add that to the list of games that you can play 5,000 different ways, right?
3387645	3388306	So, ugh.
3389146	3391749	S200 Mats is waiting for the Sonic Spinball remake.
3391849	3395593	Okay, you joke, but that should actually be a thing.
3396134	3397675	I think that should actually be a thing.
3399878	3400178	Anyway.
3401119	3404242	Alright, well, whether I like it or not, this next thing is going to be a thing.
3404302	3404543	Loki.
3407133	3418441	Yep, so apparently, like I didn't realize it was that popular, and it was popular in like Game Pass and stuff, but you may remember there was a game called High on Life by Squanch Games.
3418761	3422643	It was kind of this weird FPS thing with talking guns.
3422663	3424925	That was the Rick and Morty talking gun thing, right?
3425045	3429008	It was the Rick and Morty talking gun thing, of course, you know.
3429848	3432770	Now we have one of the game's actors, J.B.
3432830	3441375	Smooth, who is actually forming a production studio to make an animated TV show based off of the IP.
3442489	3448673	They are apparently working with, yeah, it's his alternative side productions.
3449753	3457518	And he is working along with Russell Binder and Mandy Bartisabanian and Striker Entertainment.
3457658	3459839	They're going to be serving as the producers.
3460039	3466023	Alec Robbins, the narrative director on High Life, is also working on the show.
3467063	3473111	and he says Squanch Games invited me to join them in the gaming universe and now I'm helping them move into the TV world.
3473171	3479600	It's a case of the game of game recognizing game said Jay Smoove.
3481802	3482103	Neat.
3482183	3483284	It'll be another show I don't watch.
3484212	3491656	Well, I mean, you know, especially with the connection to Rick and Morty and everything, it does kind of make sense that this would be something that would go to a TV show.
3491696	3494538	I guess maybe like I'd already forgotten about the game.
3494698	3496759	Like I noticed it when it came out, but I kind of already forgot about it.
3496799	3499020	So I guess I too was surprised the game did that well.
3499761	3507285	I guess it's better to put out a TV show a few years from when the game comes out instead of like, you know, adapting something.
3508526	3509007	20 years ago.
3539540	3540140	Ouch, true.
3540781	3542642	Okay, let's talk about this.
3542702	3544642	I think this could be an awesome collaboration.
3544763	3546063	I don't think it'll ever happen.
3546423	3549485	But of course, somebody had to ask the question and get the rumors started.
3549545	3554607	And it has to do with Digital Eclipse, which of course has been nailing a lot of recent compilations, right?
3554647	3557749	They did the Mega Man Legacy compilations, Atari 50.
3558529	3560890	They did the Ninja Turtles Cowabunga collection.
3560910	3563131	You know, they've been doing a lot of like really good stuff lately, right?
3563671	3563892	So...
3564952	3568494	The company has teamed up with Japanese companies in the past.
3568915	3572857	So could they do something with Nintendo first party sources?
3573858	3581463	This is something where there was an interview that happened with Chris Kohler from Digital Eclipse in an interview with VGC.
3582924	3588468	When asked by VGC, speaking of white gloves, presumably Nintendo isn't interested in a collaboration yet.
3588928	3596290	And the response, well, you know, historically, Other Ocean, who previously owned Digital Eclipse, did Minecraft 3DS Edition for Nintendo.
3596670	3599770	And we've done stuff for Nintendo as a company historically and in the past.
3600250	3601771	So I don't think the door is closed.
3601931	3603711	So, you know, we'll see what the future will bring.
3604051	3606252	But certainly nothing is in development at this time.
3607912	3615834	I think that's a very politically correct walking the line answer of not like killing hopes for a Nintendo collab, but making it very clear that's not on the table right now.
3617093	3622297	There was another question asked about a collaboration with like Night Dive Studios of Turok and Quake.
3623697	3631983	And in the response, he said, they're about games that are a little bit later on in terms of, whereas we're essentially about integrating emulator-based solutions into our engine.
3632363	3639908	I love you, Nintendo, but with the Nintendo Switch, it's getting on in years and it's more difficult to emulate later platforms and have them be performant on the Switch.
3640349	3643151	And so there's a little bit of a division there in terms of what we're doing.
3643951	3644812	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3666230	3667811	It's a disaster, alright.
3667851	3669052	Yeah, you got half the words right.
3669112	3669812	Have you seen it?
3670552	3671893	Was it campy enough to you?
3671913	3672734	Like, if it's campy?
3673134	3674615	I haven't seen it, so I don't know.
3674635	3675335	I'm just asking.
3676456	3677376	Was it really camp?
3678016	3679857	But was it fashion?
3679937	3683039	There's probably a better director's cut in there somewhere.
3684160	3691483	But they, because they had to make some more alterations because of those PG-13 rules, they had a lot of heads exploding, apparently.
3692684	3694385	I would like to see a rated R cut of it.
3694943	3698403	I think, or Director's Cut would be a lot better but yeah, it's not going to be
3700779	3704302	S2100Matt also says, Digital Eclipse and Nintendo would make wonderful babies.
3704922	3707244	I'm totally down for shipping that into reality.
3707704	3716490	I would love that too, but I feel like Nintendo has done all the walks down memory lane themselves, especially when you look at things like the Nintendo World Championships that just released.
3716550	3719912	I mean, that is their version of celebrating the retro classics.
3720373	3727378	I would love to see something that takes a look at it from the angle like, you know, the Gold Master Series, you know, the making of Karateka
3727938	3746238	Jeff Minter I don't think they've announced a third one yet but I'm sure there will be one eventually I would love to see something that looks like that for Nintendo I think Nintendo fans would eat that shit up I think that I would be amazing can you imagine getting to see like development documents for a game like let's say like Metroid
3746798	3755800	Let's say the Nintendo was like Metroid and you could see like sketches of the maps or, you know, what monsters looking in the early times and really hearing about how that went through.
3755880	3759821	And I, oh my God, Nintendo fans would eat that up.
3760341	3764302	But I feel like Nintendo is never going to trust an American company to do it.
3765782	3767623	And that's just the reality of how Nintendo works.
3771014	3773115	I would love nothing more than to be proven wrong.
3773435	3775656	And I think Digital Eclipse has proven that they can do it.
3775676	3778637	Because again, those Gold Master Series games that are out right now are great.
3778917	3784039	Atari 50, although not technically Gold Master Series, is basically Gold Master Series Zero.
3784459	3785520	And that one's great too.
3785700	3787460	So, yeah.
3787480	3792622	SG100Matt says, Miyamoto presenting behind the scenes of stuff from old NES games while playing the game.
3792662	3792942	Gimme.
3793102	3793442	Right?
3794123	3794343	Like...
3795163	3802148	Please, please let these get this on film before we lose these people.
3802208	3807212	And again, I know this is horrible to talk about, but like we've already lost Iwata.
3807672	3809994	We've already lost, you know, Gunpei.
3810014	3812736	Like we've lost a lot of people already.
3813637	3815759	So, and people are not getting any younger.
3815859	3820782	Please, you know, Nintendo, please, please take the game preservation seriously.
3820842	3823805	The entire enchilada, the entirety of it.
3824767	3825968	and commit it to film.
3826008	3827888	Commit it to preservation before it's too late.
3827968	3828469	I beg you.
3829849	3831710	Okay, if you don't go with digital clips, you don't.
3832030	3835171	But at least look at what they're doing and go, shit, we ought to do something like that.
3835912	3836972	We ought to build that in-house.
3837072	3837933	Our fans would love this.
3839914	3840154	All right.
3840614	3843235	Anyway, that's my ugly begging of the week.
3844856	3850178	Speaking of the week, we have another segment of the week we'd like to get to right now.
3860808	3868113	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3868553	3871075	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3872015	3876478	All right, DarkSakura, what did you pick this week for the classic game of the week?
3877899	3879780	I picked Thunder Force.
3880841	3883823	Not two, not three, which apparently I've done twice.
3884823	3885784	Not four or five.
3886784	3887505	I did the first one.
3889144	3891507	How many of you have played the original Thunder Force?
3892809	3898336	I have never, actually, although I already see similarities to other games I've played, so influence, but never the original.
3899478	3906046	Yeah, so basically the original Thunder Force was a sort of free roaming, scrolling shooter game.
3907718	3912482	and it was released by Technosoft in 1983 and it was the first of the series.
3912743	3922791	It was originally released for the X1 computer and later on for the Sharp MZ-1500, the PC-6001 Mark II and in 1985 it came out for the PC-8801 Mark II.
3930097	3958857	and in 1984 we had a release for the FM7 and PC9801 computers as Thunder Force Construction that had an add-on, had a level generator level editor and game creation system and yeah, Quest Buster the first one a lot of people played was Thunder Force 2 and aspects from this game made it into Thunder Force 2 but after 3 came out it was like Thunder Force, we don't know, huh?
3959917	3980522	so basically you have to you fly around and over these occupied areas and destroy base installations and tunnels um there's different shield generators you have to get them under the these targets that are on the ground and then you after you destroy all the shield generators then you can move on um
3982003	4009974	and then once the entire section is destroyed the Dryadizer which is like the the big enemy thing it'll vanish and then you'll move on to the next area to keep playing you are going against the Orn Empire and they are going on that fortress, the Dryadizer it moves every time and basically you're going to go blow that up and knock them out of the place you were playing the Fire Leo
4011755	4029246	it was created by Yoshimura Kotori who left Technosoft and founded Arsys Software in 1985 so this is a lady game designer in the 80s so thank you ma'am
4030346	4039973	In 1984, and I mentioned this earlier, Technosoft did a level editor, or what they were calling a game creation system, called Thunder Force Construction.
4040613	4046798	And it was also directly created by Yoshimura for the FM7 computer.
4047938	4051961	Now, what is... Why am I even going to this one?
4052341	4052782	Because...
4054124	4056165	Fair's like hardly any good version of this game.
4056205	4056985	I'm going to put it right now.
4057106	4057686	I don't enjoy it.
4057826	4058246	It's not fun.
4059427	4060107	I went and tried it.
4060347	4064469	I didn't mention it in my week, but it's hard.
4065670	4067171	I mean, not my kind of game.
4067931	4079957	But without this game, we would never have had the amazing series of shooter games that we have now with the epic music, especially Thunder Force 3.
4079997	4080037	Um...
4083214	4087176	And I mean, and don't forget the weird Super Nintendo one.
4087716	4097061	So Thunder Force 3 came out on Mega Drive and then got ported to arcade and that arcade version got ported back to the Super Famicom as Lightning Force and it's spelled Lightening.
4097941	4098882	Like, what are you going to do?
4098962	4102424	Like, you're going to bleach your hair and then color it and that's Lightning Force, I guess.
4103764	4105005	And then you're searching for your sister.
4106966	4107186	Okay.
4107206	4107286	Okay.
4108650	4109250	No, wrong lightning.
4109311	4112152	It's L-I-G-H-T-E-N-I-N-G.
4112172	4113673	I was trying to make a fantasy joke.
4113753	4113993	Okay.
4114814	4116314	Yeah.
4118135	4125840	So, I think that we have a lot to owe to with this game.
4125940	4130622	I mean, seriously, it gave us one of the best shmups ever.
4130883	4131803	Series of shmups ever.
4132584	4135085	And to think it had such a humble start.
4136755	4139296	I mean, we gotta know where our games came from.
4142557	4142997	And there you go.
4143998	4147319	Alright, Thunder Force, your classic game of the week.
4147399	4148860	And that's how it goes here sometimes.
4149340	4154842	Sometimes the game itself isn't like, oh my god, you gotta stop everything and play this game right now and remember this.
4154882	4158123	But sometimes it's, hey, without this, we wouldn't have had this.
4158764	4161705	Or this is the thing that brought us this, you know, so...
4162805	4164006	One good idea led to another.
4164406	4165427	So there you go, Thunder Force.
4165527	4166768	It was a great game.
4167068	4168309	I mean, the later ones are great.
4168429	4168989	Maybe not that one.
4169650	4171291	But the music, though.
4171391	4173833	The music in Thunder Force 3 is epic.
4174093	4175534	Yeah.
4175674	4179036	OrangeRite points out, even Street Fighter 2 had to start with Street Fighter 1.
4179597	4181298	That's a really good analogy there.
4181959	4183560	How hard can you hit that button?
4185701	4186201	Oh my gosh.
4186942	4189524	I'm sure arcade operators loved that.
4191033	4198721	OrangeRiteChat says, we started with a Busconian-like, then a Busconian-like that swaps between that and a side-scrolling shmup, and then it's just a shmup, but a really good one.
4200343	4201544	Games go on journeys sometimes.
4201664	4202025	It happens.
4203846	4209930	Alright, well we have a few quick stories for you, but the news is thinning, so we're going to get to our Lister Roundtable here in just a bit.
4210490	4215053	If you want to join us, vognetwork.com.discord, that's vognetwork.com.discord.
4215353	4219375	We'll also check our mailbag as well, participate at orangeloundtrader.com.
4219676	4221237	But first, some quick headlines.
4221357	4221597	Loki.
4222954	4231058	Ready at Dawn Studios, the game studio behind a lot of popular games, including The Order 1886 and Daxter.
4231978	4239742	They, of course, most recently were the studio behind Echo, a VR series on the MetaQuest.
4240822	4242883	And they have been shut down by Meta.
4243224	4244404	Effective immediately.
4245385	4245825	Yep.
4246658	4253601	Yeah, so apparently Meta's decision to close Radiate Don Cito's is almost a year and a half after purchasing them.
4255042	4265967	This is because, I guess, on their mid-July report, they had plans to cut their Reality Labs division budget by 20% by 2026.
4267227	4272530	So, in other words, investors need that, you know, need the line to go up, I guess.
4274490	4275191	Well, that sucks.
4277201	4277922	when does it end?
4278203	4279305	when does it end?
4280267	4280688	DarkSakura
4285896	4288218	I watched some of this on the PTB.
4288298	4289239	This was so cool.
4290019	4296163	But yeah, there are some details out for the Castlevania chapter of Dead by Daylight.
4297604	4298905	And I watched people play it.
4299045	4300406	It was pretty neat.
4301287	4308332	Your survivor is Trevor Belmont, which just strikes me as weird as having one of the Belmonts as a survivor.
4308872	4316416	But I like in the little trailer video, he sees the castle and reaches for his whip only to find that it's not there.
4319058	4324141	And then, of course, you are Dracula, who, I mean, this is...
4325709	4332551	I have a feeling it's based off of Symphony Dracula or maybe one of the re-releases.
4333491	4347696	But there's something interesting that I wanted to point out because Dan and I were talking about the chase music and how we didn't really care for it at first, but that music actually comes from the first Castlevania.
4347776	4352437	It's Nothing to Lose, which is one of the boss music.
4352757	4353578	I didn't catch that.
4353598	4354458	I have to listen again.
4356926	4384967	if you go watch Mint Skull's video about it it's like 10 fun facts about Dracula you might not know anyway but it's some good points on there and kudos to him for doing the research on that one but it's there's rumors that actually I don't know if it's a rumor anymore that one of the skins that's going to come out for Trevor will be Alucard although honestly give me Richter
4385607	4387329	Give me Richter.
4388590	4389010	Give him.
4389771	4390391	I want him.
4391472	4392373	Or maybe a Maria.
4393251	4394212	Ooh, I love that.
4394672	4395313	Or a cypher.
4395573	4398215	I gotta say though, Dracula looks insanely fun.
4398235	4400036	Like, I haven't played Killer in DBD in a while.
4400136	4408042	Dracula looks insanely fun to play because I almost feel like Dracula is like a mishmash of like four other killers in the game right now.
4408742	4412305	And he's not quite as strong as any of them, but he has like some of the best parts.
4412325	4414447	Like his Hellfire is like Pyramid Head's thing.
4414467	4415307	His...
4416428	4417130	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4417170	4417550	It's like a...
4428720	4449391	but the the but I mean it's just great they gave all the right nods you know they they did this right from what I could tell I mean definitely there's some tweaking and balance issues um and the character designs I have to say these are some of the best we've seen um in Dead by Daylight some of the best homage I mean
4450351	4451391	I'm I'm into it.
4451511	4464796	And then, of course, there's all the voice lines like and especially like, you know, how when you're playing Wesker and he's got, you know, when it's one of the Resident Evil people in the lobby, he has certain things for them.
4466016	4472919	That he says, yeah, Dracula has that specifically for for Belmont and special Maury dialogue.
4472939	4473579	Hmm.
4475017	4478522	So it's pretty epic.
4478542	4485272	Well, that's two Konami games now in Dead by Daylight with Silent Hill and Castlevania.
4485312	4490720	Do you think we get Metal Gear Solid next where maybe Psycho Mantis is a killer?
4491621	4503072	I don't think we'll get Psycho Mantis, I think we would get Liquid Snake if anything I was just thinking that he could read your cosmetics I don't want Solid Snake in the game unless it's David Hayter
4507773	4508494	Fair call, fair call.
4508514	4508995	Just saying.
4510075	4510956	And you know he'd do it.
4511477	4512217	You know he'd do it.
4512317	4512698	Absolutely.
4512718	4523367	But I was going to say, one other DBD tidbit that came out this last week, they confirmed on the official DBD social medias that Five Nights at Freddy's is going to be a thing next year.
4524388	4525429	I have feelings about it.
4525469	4526730	I will not be buying...
4527170	4540092	the biggest fan wank request they've been getting on social media for a while they're finally caving in and doing it's going to be interesting if it's a cosmetic thing I'm not going to buy any of it I'm not going to support that DLC
4542124	4545205	Because you know what happened with the creator.
4545225	4546565	I've heard things about the creator, yeah.
4546925	4549586	So I understand why people avoid it.
4549686	4557168	I mean, and I shouldn't have put any money into the Shinjeki no Kyojin Attack on Titan chapter either.
4558188	4562869	And I regret having done so just because of what an absolute garbage person the creator is.
4565340	4586955	I don't write the news, I just report it So that is coming to Dead by Daylight next year Alright, and I've got one quick thing for you as well This has to do with Xbox Game Pass You know, Game Pass has had a lot of news lately And they're trying to add some more games to sweeten the deal So we do have some more games that are coming to Game Pass Including on August 7th, Creatures of Ava
4587776	4589437	Crash August 8th.
4589477	4590637	So these already happened.
4590737	4594259	The Crash Bandicoot Insane Trilogy came out on Xbox.
4594279	4594879	Well, that's fun.
4595499	4601321	And then this week, Mafia Definitive Edition is happening this coming week as well.
4601361	4608164	And also, if you already missed it, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is also something that came out pretty recently there.
4608584	4614807	Now, it should be also pointed out, some games are leaving on August 15th, including Airborne Kingdoms.
4615507	4621933	Offworld Trading Company, Shadow Warrior 3, and this one surprises me, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
4622774	4624836	Alan still plays that game a lot and loves that game.
4624876	4635306	I mean, he doesn't play it through Xbox, so it doesn't matter to him, but I know that game was getting a lot of eyes at first thanks to Game Pass, and I'm sure the deal was only for a year, because it feels like it's been about a year since Texas Chainsaw came out, but...
4636727	4638850	I don't know if that's a good move for that.
4638910	4647942	I feel like that game's player base is not as big as it was, and they don't exactly have the huge license pool to pull from to get a lot of new stuff in there.
4648082	4652828	I mean, how did the Killer Clowns from Outer Space game do?
4652848	4653168	I mean...
4655590	4660613	I feel like that game had a huge splash when it came out and it immediately fell off the radar.
4661193	4662354	So I don't know.
4662374	4666837	I'd have to see how that translated to sales because, again, it doesn't matter if people aren't streaming it.
4666937	4668217	It just needs to sell copies.
4668938	4670819	But I feel like it did pretty good at first.
4671019	4672440	So we'd have to look into that.
4674321	4674581	All right.
4675842	4681385	Well, let's travel around the world and see what games are coming out this week in our World Release Date segment.
4681405	4682626	So we'll start with the U.S., Loki.
4683839	4685440	Yeah, we've got a few things.
4685561	4689083	So, Shoulders of Giants Ultimate on PlayStation 5.

4797659	4798839	Nothing is coming out in Japan this week.
4799219	4801320	And it is not Golden Week.
4802761	4807463	Mountain Day is tomorrow, but I wouldn't think that would affect the gaming releases.
4807523	4809844	But for whatever reason, we have no releases in Japan this week.
4810544	4811104	So that's that.

4843593	4848474	Well, with that, we have reached the end of the news that we had scheduled for tonight.
4849174	4850755	So we're going to move into our listener roundtable.
4850815	4853615	We're going to check our emails, and we'll take any calls if anyone wants to call in.
4854196	4857256	But participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send us emails.
4857516	4858477	DarkSakura, what do we got?
4859577	4859677	One.
4860257	4868519	And it's someone who didn't either was trying to be funny or didn't get the assignment.
4869419	4869519	So
4872879	4874101	I'll go ahead and start it.
4874161	4875823	Redertainment says, Hello, peoples.
4875903	4878186	Last Sunday, you requested that viewers send in pictures of their pets.
4878386	4879207	Now, I don't have any pets.
4879247	4881149	What I do have is a growing menagerie of stuffies.
4881850	4884213	And I am going to stop right there because that is not what I asked for.
4885635	4889359	I want real, breathing, alive creatures.
4890253	4894636	who have personality, who can communicate with you in one way or another.
4895457	4896898	And I love my stuffed animals too.
4896998	4898059	I have quite the collection.
4898159	4899600	And yours are very cute.
4899680	4907727	I see you have a Marie from Aristocats and a Yoshi and an octopus flipping people off with every tentacle.
4909088	4916654	But I'm looking for real life cats, dogs, ferrets.
4918345	4919406	Just no mollusks.
4920066	4921187	No mollusks at all.
4922107	4925989	If you have to look it up, just don't put it on there.
4927210	4930171	Crustaceans also, not included, not invited.
4931572	4932453	Birds are okay, though.
4933253	4933833	Birds are okay.
4933933	4935174	I want feathers, I want fur.
4935594	4937095	And scales.
4937355	4939296	I want lizards and snakes.
4940277	4946060	If you have a fish, a fish is okay, as long as tank mollusks don't appear in the photo at all.
4947854	4948555	It's not funny.
4948635	4950318	I have like a real legit bad phobia.
4950358	4953723	I know, but I'm just saying your laundry list is kind of amusing.
4954804	4956827	I just don't want mollusks or crustaceans.
4956907	4957348	It's easy.
4958950	4959250	All right.
4960652	4960993	Wah.
4961674	4962956	Okay.
4963196	4964478	That's it for emails then, right?
4966205	4974770	Well, if you would like to send us pretty pet pictures, as mentioned previously, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do it.
4975491	4977852	Loki, checking in with you to see if there's any last minute stories tonight.
4980854	4985597	Yeah, there's been some leaks regarding what the microtransactions are going to look like for Concord.
4986682	4993645	And so, essentially, the currency packs are going to run 500 to 12,000 coins.
4995425	5000747	And then they said that character skins, on the other hand, they showed off what some of those are.
5000767	5002728	Yeah, they look dumb.
5003828	5010030	It doesn't say exactly what the prices are on these.
5011691	5011811	Hmm.
5015553	5015893	Oh, okay.
5016173	5016673	Let's see.
5018094	5019514	I mean, the skins look stupid.
5021355	5021835	Honestly.
5024596	5026657	I thought I was supposed to show the prices on that stuff.
5028137	5028778	Okay, well.
5028798	5031839	Let's wait and see.
5031919	5032639	To be determined.
5033679	5035040	Please look forward to it.
5035540	5036000	Or don't.
5037861	5038221	Alright.
5039161	5067390	well y'all I think that brings us to the end of a rather short show tonight but again the news is just a little bit off cycle and you know that's reflected too in even the game releases so it's a cruel summer when it comes to the news but things are going to be picking up again a little bit towards the coming weeks with Gamescom and all that good stuff so yeah look forward to that so now we're at the part of the show where we get everybody's final thoughts um fuck
5067950	5069431	Sorry, I've had a bad spill.
5069471	5070751	I need you guys to kill time.
5074493	5080015	Anyway, I think, though, are you going to be playing anything new coming up in the next couple of weeks?
5083356	5083576	Me?
5086277	5093099	I've considered checking out Earth Defense Force 6, but probably not anytime soon.
5093119	5093160	Um...
5095916	5096336	I don't know.
5096817	5099119	I've been playing kind of the same stuff over and over.
5099279	5108767	I need to finish off Goat Simulator 3, 100%ing that because I started the DLC on that and that should be fun.
5109227	5114851	And I know my other server mates have been playing Goat Simulator 3 as well.
5116833	5118194	I think probably...
5120339	5122841	I don't think there's anything coming out at the end of this year that looked good.
5123281	5127164	Funny enough, actually, that game Castaway I was just talking about looks kind of cool.
5127385	5134150	It's essentially Link's Awakening, but without Legend of Zelda thrown in there.
5134610	5140595	But as close to remaking that game in the same art style as possible.
5141075	5142937	So that looks kind of cool.
5142957	5143617	Yeah.
5144437	5150138	and then I think it may, it almost looks like it could be a roguelite but I don't think it is.
5151719	5152699	But they look neat.
5153079	5153979	Let me check that out.
5154100	5168923	I've been just trying to reconcile all the games I have on Humble Bundle and making sure that I have them in my library in Steam and I've unfortunately lost track of what I have put in there, what I have and I wish there was like a more definitive way to do that.
5171324	5171464	Yep.
5173143	5181689	Well, I do want to give a warning out for people who are trying out the GOG Galaxy app on Mac.
5182809	5192556	It has this weird thing where the servers will disconnect on it if you do not immediately open an executable that's the connection protocol for Terminal.
5194637	5198460	And the thing is that now the Shortcuts app cannot run Terminal.
5198480	5202563	You can run shell scripts, and I'm thinking about just making a script for it and everything, but
5203583	5229327	apparently it's been like this for years and anyone who wants to use that service and you're on a Mac definitely makes some noise so I have just removed it from my system after I redeemed some games for free and yeah, not nice but as far as games I'll be playing of course Colts of the Land, the new DLC I'm not going to have my Friday stream because it's fucking Friday we put it off for two weeks
5229887	5234814	We'll be playing Jackbox games instead and drinking heavily and dishing about ballet.
5236856	5238879	Sounds fun.
5240000	5241803	You might see me play it on Wednesday, I don't know.
5242263	5245347	But I've been looking forward to this because I still love that game.
5245387	5248111	Maybe everyone else forgot about it, but I love it.
5249528	5279043	and so we haven't had a return from Rob yet so we don't have controls to do anything with that so I am going to say that I have a challenge for all of our listeners right now I want you to email us and I mean this I am serious and I want each of you to tell me what game sequel that you want to see come out I'm looking for common threads
5280416	5294817	or what kind of game that you would you would want to see like what what we just need more email people give me something to do geez or else we're gonna end an hour early like we did tonight and that's not gonna be good for everybody
5295549	5295829	All right.
5295869	5296669	I'm sorry about that.
5297309	5303091	Some of you that were watching live probably saw that I was sipping on a very nice iced coffee that Alan went and got me during the show.
5303191	5307792	And I spilled said coffee all over the carpeted floor and ice cubes.
5307992	5310413	Yeah, clearly a little bit of a drinking problem.
5310453	5312593	So I'm more worried about putting a stain on the carpet.
5312633	5313774	That's the part that pisses me off.
5315774	5318515	Alan, I'm so sorry I ruined your life.
5318655	5320537	No, he did not ruin my life.
5320917	5327984	I feel bad because he tried to do a really nice thing by getting me coffee during this very hot part of the day and I went and spilled it all over the floor because I'm a stupid bitch.
5328244	5329205	You are not.
5330458	5331839	He's a stupid bitch.
5332019	5333459	E3VL does have a very good point.
5333619	5335000	Better iced than hot.
5335360	5335700	Yes.
5336200	5336721	Very that.
5336741	5337461	Thank you.
5337501	5338481	Thank you, PodCulture.
5339142	5344364	But later I will tell you the thing that I do to get cat yarf out of my carpet.
5346845	5349166	Well, it's not discoloring too bad yet.
5349466	5351687	I'll just hope we have some of that cleaner left.
5351747	5354608	We have some stuff to get that shit out of the carpet.
5354668	5355068	Good luck.
5355128	5356149	I hope it doesn't stain.
5356329	5359430	But then again, you can say it's your inaugural stain.
5359450	5359530	Yeah.
5360788	5360928	Oh, no.
5360948	5361068	Yeah.
5381065	5407360	yeah all right all right well sorry to put you all on the spot by time shit happens um thank you but we are back uh coffee happens so i was trying to wrap up the show if i could have just went like two more minutes we would have done with the show but anyway oh yeah it's a good content now and i have a challenge out to the community to send me rad um a game sequel that they want to see happen oh love it love it uh and then explain and justify why it should be the guardian legend i'm just kidding
5409123	5411387	I don't have to justify shit about the Guardian legend.
5411507	5412188	It's amazing.
5413189	5413469	All right.
5414311	5421060	Anyway, with that, thank you as always in spite of user errors for listening to and downloading Orange Lounge Radio.
5421641	5425406	If you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, thank you especially for getting this far and still saying that.
5427367	5429729	Leave a nice five-star review wherever it is you found this show.
5430049	5433471	Whether it was Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, wherever it is you found this show.
5433812	5435493	A nice word of mouth goes a long way as well.
5435533	5436654	Tell a friend or two about the show.
5436994	5439375	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5439415	5442377	We just need more voices to put out there on air.
5442918	5443278	All right.
5443418	5445159	With that, we're going to wrap up.
5445199	5448862	We're going to say bye to DarkSakura first because she's going to do some...
5452085	5459567	No, we're going to be doing... It may be the last week of 2v8, and I will have open lobbies.
5459667	5460827	If not, I'll start off with Killer.
5461847	5463887	It might just be me and Shayla to start off with.
5464648	5465928	There might be some Killer happening.
5466368	5468688	I've decided this mode makes me a Wraith fan.
5470369	5471649	Oh, yeah.
5472389	5475890	It was a clusterfuck the one time I tried it, so it's interesting, though.
5476630	5477670	You're welcome to join in.
5477790	5479391	But in the meantime, everybody...
5481755	5482395	Do what I said.
5482815	5483135	Email.
5483916	5484456	Give me something to do.
5485196	5485396	All right.
5485416	5486757	Have a good one, Jamie.
5486917	5487417	Bye-bye.
5488597	5489057	All right.
5489097	5491938	Well, with that, Loki, we will turn to you and your final thought tonight.
5493259	5495039	Hopefully, we'll have a new episode out this week.
5495659	5498400	I've been working hard to get it done and getting there.
5498640	5500181	So hopefully, I'll be out this week.
5500241	5503262	And yeah, check out the short if you haven't yet.
5503959	5505180	All right.
5505260	5507762	My final thought, I don't really have a big one.
5508502	5514807	My personal streaming, once again, has just been by this wayside of other things I'm doing.
5514867	5518049	But it's actually been really good for me being able to play games on my own schedule.
5518150	5519911	So there is that.
5520011	5521832	So hopefully I'll make some more progress in Pokemon.
5521852	5523694	I'm looking to clear the water gym tonight.
5523774	5524654	So we'll see how that goes.
5525415	5528397	And hey, maybe I might even want to do some trades.
5528958	5530319	Usually I use Pokemon Home.
5530959	5539863	But if you're a Pokemon Violet owner, I have Pokemon Scarlet and maybe we need to do some trades because I do want to get some of the uniques, build up my team there, at least the ones I can get so far.
5540603	5541944	So that's it.
5542164	5544044	That's it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
5544064	5545765	Thank you all so much for listening tonight.
5546105	5547606	We will see you in seven days.
5547766	5552448	And until then, please, please critically think about things.
5552788	5553288	Good night.
5555489	5557750	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5560229	5560729	See you next week.
