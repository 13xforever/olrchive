1
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:17,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Revisiting Duke Nukem 3D with developer commentary and even a fifth episode, in addition to the fourth episode I hadn't played until then, in the 20th anniversary edition was really cool.

2
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:21,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, mine and so many others first shooter love, Doom, is getting similar treatment.

3
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:27,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet another Doom compendium, including Doom 2, a new episode, and so much more, is whetting our appetites even before the Dark Ages itself.

4
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:28,683
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we rip and tear.

5
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:33,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell me about their story, and there's the week's gaming news.

6
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:36,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:42,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

8
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:50,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Orange Lounge Radio Live.

10
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, August the 11th of 2024 with episode number 1013 of our show.

11
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob Roberts, Jason,

12
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,448
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:38,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I can use some more coffee.

14
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see how any week could be as good as a week where you went to California Extreme, but meh, you know, we move on.

15
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:45,487
[SPEAKER_08]: We move on with our lives.

16
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:48,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll actually have a really good week coming up.

17
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:48,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah?

18
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,432
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you doing this week?

19
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:51,375
[SPEAKER_01]: TwitchCon!

20
00:01:51,655 --> 00:01:54,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, your next big convention is probably going to be TwitchCon, huh?

21
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:55,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Frozen 3

22
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:18,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even watch two.

23
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:45,189
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has the distinction of being in Florida.

24
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I have a problem with Florida in general, but humidity is garbola.

25
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:55,316
[SPEAKER_08]: We have listeners in Florida and the problem isn't you.

26
00:02:57,214 --> 00:03:03,699
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that I grew up on the Gulf Coast and no thank you Hey Loki, how are you doing?

27
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing pretty good.

28
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:21,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So would it be Florida?

29
00:03:24,653 --> 00:03:26,695
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what sounds like your third day at Disney World.

30
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:27,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Florida.

31
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:29,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

32
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,060
[SPEAKER_08]: S2100 Matt says, Loki is playing that roller coaster meme Rob and I like.

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

34
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,765
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my favorite YouTube videos of the Rihanna song that transitions into the Adele song when the coaster crashes.

35
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:44,106
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me laugh every single time.

36
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:45,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Every single time.

37
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:47,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that why you're doing Planet Coaster tonight?

38
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:48,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is this like a D23 wink and nod?

39
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,511
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's because I'm working on roller coaster rides in my Minecraft stuff, and I don't know.

40
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:59,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't think of anything else to put in there, because I don't play any other games.

41
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:10,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, not so much Planet Coaster, but yeah, I've got footage I took of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and stuff like that.

42
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:28,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network twitch.tv slash VOG Network nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show and sometimes Bobby hangs out in our chat after and he says Broccoli Farm in Planet Coaster.

43
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:36,682
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the week you weren't here Loki when you were sick and I was playing No Man's Sky I don't know if you know but we named our default planet Broccoli Farm.

44
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:39,368
[SPEAKER_08]: after taking suggestions from chat.

45
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we named the planet Broccoli Farm.

46
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:42,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

47
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:43,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the best place on Earth.

48
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,823
[SPEAKER_08]: The happiest place on Earth.

49
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:48,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

50
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:49,602
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

51
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen like I've seen the YouTube videos or whatever of likes.

52
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:57,604
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not the only person that's like pulled that kind of joke on somebody.

53
00:04:58,084 --> 00:04:59,525
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like a smaller kid.

54
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:03,786
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kid was very disappointed that he did not go to a broccoli farm.

55
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Really wanted to go to a broccoli farm.

56
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:10,348
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as makes me go ahead.

57
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:12,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of the deep thoughts by Jack Handy.

58
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I tell my friend, Disneyland burned down.

59
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:17,661
[SPEAKER_08]: He cried and cried.

60
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we decided to just go home.

61
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:23,823
[SPEAKER_08]: So good, so good.

62
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:27,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Bobby says, I think one of the animals looked like broccoli.

63
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:30,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's how that whole thing started, is there was an animal like broccoli.

64
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:35,666
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was going to say, as far as broccoli goes, honestly, there's lots of vegetables out there and broccoli's

65
00:05:37,066 --> 00:06:05,030
[SPEAKER_08]: actually one of my favorites like absolute favorite vegetables like to put in a salad or as a side like if usually if I get like a vegetable medley or you know how like you go to a diner and like the the side food is like vegetable mix spring mix or whatever like I usually pick out the broccoli first broccoli especially when you put butter salt or um the best is the old spaghetti factory mazithra stuff on the broccoli which at that point isn't really healthy who cares it's broccoli it's pretty good

66
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, I don't know.

67
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:09,505
[SPEAKER_04]: We're usually mixing it with mac and cheese, so.

68
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:10,208
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

69
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:11,653
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get the greens in somewhere.

70
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:21,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And there you go.

71
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,514
[SPEAKER_04]: We've now contractually fulfilled our obligation for Orange Lunch Foodio.

72
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:27,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

73
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:29,535
[SPEAKER_04]: We can reset the counter now.

74
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:30,175
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

75
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:32,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Days without a food tangent.

76
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:32,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero.

77
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, here's the thing.

78
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:35,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we're a video gaming podcast.

79
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get into the news, we actually have a breaking story to start us off tonight that broke just an hour ago before we went live.

80
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:50,206
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very, this is a, and we commented on this last week and probably the week before, this is an uncharacteristically slow news period.

81
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not sure what's to blame for that.

82
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:59,589
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Bobby has thrown out a theory on his show about how there's less news outlets because of all the shitty things going on.

83
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, we're talking about Game Informer last week and all these other things.

84
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:25,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamescom is right around the corner too though so that's true too and without an E3 Gamescom is kind of now I think where we're going to get some investments like we know we have Civ 7 is going to be a thing at Gamescom I also would argue I mean not to I think I do think Bobby is right to a point like I do think that is a part of it so this isn't to disagree with him I think it's multiple factors I think the other factor that maybe we're neglecting is the Olympics because

85
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:27,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that like, whatever, it's the Olympics.

86
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,770
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not video games.

87
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:34,691
[SPEAKER_08]: But the Olympics tends to monopolize entertainment media and entertainment reporting for the two weeks it's on.

88
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:35,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously not completely.

89
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:37,732
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of other things in the world to be talking about.

90
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:41,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we could be talking about how awesome the Borderlands movie did at the box office.

91
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:48,655
[SPEAKER_08]: But actually, this is not a good weekend to release movies either because the Olympics.

92
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:59,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the Olympics might play into that a little bit as well.

93
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,343
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just a weird period.

94
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:04,565
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, to be honest, we don't have a lot of gaming news tonight.

95
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:09,168
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some, and we'll get into it, but a food tangent is how we're going to fill the time tonight.

96
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're encouraging listeners to eat broccoli.

97
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what other gaming podcast out there encourages such health of their listeners?

98
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:28,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're hyper-Orthodox, I will say, just because there are reasons that broccoli tops are frowned upon in Orthodox communities.

99
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:30,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to force you to eat anything.

100
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,754
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want is, like, I want carrots.

101
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Carrots are also good.

102
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:47,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I've surely I've told the story on this show about how my mom had to take me to the hospital because my face started turning orange when I was young because I ate too many carrots.

103
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:48,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Susan Day.

104
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:49,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

105
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,985
[SPEAKER_08]: That literally happened to me.

106
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:54,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't.

107
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:56,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I ate too many carrots.

108
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:58,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the only vegetable I'd eat as a kid.

109
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:06,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I've decided that putting shredded carrot or very finely diced carrot in my chicken salad is amazing.

110
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:11,946
[SPEAKER_08]: PodCulture in chat says, raw carrots are awesome, cooked carrots are nasty.

111
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:12,506
[SPEAKER_08]: 100% agree.

112
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:12,786
[SPEAKER_08]: 100% agree.

113
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:14,968
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

114
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:20,911
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some ways to cook carrots that are really good roasted, blanched.

115
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:21,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you that.

116
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, roasted, yeah.

117
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:27,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Steam, like very steamed, while they're still a little firm, but it brings out that extra sweetness.

118
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:30,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Pan fried where you caramelize them.

119
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, butter and brown sugar.

120
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:35,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, make them completely unhealthy.

121
00:09:35,956 --> 00:09:36,936
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually just ruined it.

122
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:38,197
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

123
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:40,699
[SPEAKER_01]: And carrot cake, the best way.

124
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:41,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all right.

125
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,840
[SPEAKER_08]: On that note, no more food.

126
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's talk about what's going on in the gaming industry.

127
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:48,024
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start off with some breaking news.

128
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:56,049
[SPEAKER_08]: This just happened just before the show, during Bobby's show actually, is that Tango Gameworks, which of course was an Xbox studio that got closed,

129
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:57,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Tango Gameworks Tango Gameworks

130
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Tango Gameworks Tango Gameworks

131
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:42,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Tango Gameworks Acclaimed IP Hi-Fi Rush

132
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:10,372
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

133
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:39,753
[SPEAKER_08]: hopefully most of the folks that worked on the game you know some had to resign before the game even came out but most of the folks that worked on the game will essentially be saved and a sequel at this point is all but guaranteed eventually pretty cool

134
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:41,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So, very happy with that.

135
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:49,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Also guaranteed probably some kind of collaboration of the IP with PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

136
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:57,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I get that PUBG is not Fortnite, so we're not going to get cartoony things, but maybe a t-shirt, maybe a weapon inspired by something.

137
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,605
[SPEAKER_08]: The last relevance PUBG ever had in my life was when I was considering getting that Dwight cosmetic for DBD.

138
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I forgot DBD even did a crossover with that game.

139
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,000
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

140
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, PUBG definitely seemed to fade to the background once Fortnite Battle Royale really kind of took over.

141
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:27,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know, being on mobile devices and tablets and all those places really kind of helped Fortnite.

142
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:29,609
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

143
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And PUBG is kind of more realistic.

144
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,033
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think kids get more into Fortnite and parents aren't as, you know, weirded out with it.

145
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:37,634
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, there's a variety of reasons.

146
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,976
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, PUBG definitely hasn't been on my radar for some time.

147
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:41,337
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe that's...

148
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:45,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of why we do strategical acquisitions to try to get back on the radar.

149
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,000
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

150
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:48,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So more to come on this.

151
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:51,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this news is breaking during tonight's show, so we'll probably hear more throughout the week.

152
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:55,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move into what was originally going to be our kickoff topic tonight.

153
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:59,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I'll turn it over to you because this is a game that your kids have subjected you to.

154
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm very curious about your take on this.

155
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:09,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's nothing unheard of that we've heard many times already from Roblox.

156
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:30,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, the consensus is that Roblox has some kind of predatory stuff with everything pretty much in Roblox, from the way it's monetized to the whole creator program and how they don't really pay out their creators, or at least they make you go through a bunch of hoops.

157
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:47,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially they're saying that because of all of this stuff, Turkey is banning the game right now due to possible child exploitation.

158
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:54,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Roblox is apparently working with the country to try to bring the game back into that territory.

159
00:13:55,784 --> 00:14:03,710
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that due to content that could lead to the exploitation of children, they have banned the game in the country.

160
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is coming from Turkey's Minister of Justice.

161
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:14,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean that's... Some of the comments made by...

162
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:46,063
[SPEAKER_04]: their CEO too is just like yeah yeah like what was it like Stefano Corazza we talked about this before where it's like so I can be like a 15 year old in living in Indonesia living in a slum and then now with just a laptop I can create something make money and sustain my life okay that's not realistic but sure you can just paint that like how you're doing all this good but

163
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:49,249
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're not.

164
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:53,320
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't trust corporations here on, you know, the internet.

165
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry, just don't believe you.

166
00:14:58,254 --> 00:14:58,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

167
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:02,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know enough about Roblox to know like what is going on.

168
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:07,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I just know like, like, Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, like kids are able to build things in the ecosystem, right?

169
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:09,183
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be like when you and I were 15.

170
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:11,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were playing ZZT.

171
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:16,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Essentially, this would be like if we could sell the things we were making in ZZT at 15 years old to a wider audience.

172
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,952
[SPEAKER_08]: But essentially, we were well, we would have been getting paid in gift cards.

173
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:21,970
[SPEAKER_08]: for the most part, right?

174
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:33,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, yeah, they've got it where you can cash out, but it's like every step of the way, it's kind of like going through the GameStop trade-in process.

175
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:34,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, okay...

176
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:37,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a game.

177
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:42,839
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll buy it off of you for whatever the used price is.

178
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a drop in the cost of that.

179
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So Madden 22, they'll buy for 50 cents at this point.

180
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:50,843
[SPEAKER_04]: For 50 cents, yeah.

181
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,984
[SPEAKER_04]: But then if you want cash, then that's going to be another 30% off.

182
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:55,445
[SPEAKER_04]: A nickel.

183
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:22,278
[SPEAKER_04]: then there's the conversion fees and the platform fees and stuff like that and then there's even more percentage off and then it's like oh well then now I need to change these Roblox or Robux into cash and it's like even more of a percentage off so you have to in order to get paid out you have to make like three to six times the amount of money that's the minimum for that payout because of all that stuff but

184
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:47,990
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah so that could be a little bit predatory plus you know just the monetization that's in these games it's it's all over the place because it's kids making the well and corporations and then they try to also like get you to buy like movie tickets and stuff like that through this and they have the whole um Beetlejuice experience which is funny because like I think a lot of the people playing Roblox I mean aside from like really little kids are probably just like

185
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smell this average gaming from a mile away.

186
00:16:54,681 --> 00:17:00,324
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably don't have that emotional connection to the original either because that original is what, like 30 years old at this point?

187
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:01,305
[SPEAKER_08]: No, more.

188
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:04,127
[SPEAKER_08]: God, it was a late 80s movie, like 35 years old at this point probably.

189
00:17:05,948 --> 00:17:14,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're just bringing back these old franchises which, you know, certain people will find nostalgic but those people that would find it nostalgic aren't playing Roblox.

190
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:15,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

191
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:21,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Roblox hasn't really broken through with the gamers above the age of 18, it seems.

192
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,337
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not really, I don't think.

193
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:28,859
[SPEAKER_04]: But that could change, you never know, because you may have kids that grow up on that.

194
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:31,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, as kids get older, yeah, of course.

195
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:33,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to say.

196
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:40,165
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, certainly, I know my oldest son is kind of growing out of it a little bit, but he still plays stuff.

197
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:41,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends on what his friends want to play.

198
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:42,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

199
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:43,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

200
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:52,586
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been he's been he had me put my Xbox Series X in his room and he's been playing through Red Dead Redemption 2.

201
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:55,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, kind of beat that before summer breaks over.

202
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised summer break isn't already over.

203
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Some kids are already going back to school.

204
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:02,923
[SPEAKER_04]: My youngest goes back tomorrow.

205
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:05,044
[SPEAKER_04]: He starts high school on Thursday.

206
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:05,545
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

207
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:07,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Your youngest starts high school or your oldest?

208
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:11,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say your youngest is not high school.

209
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:12,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Your oldest starts high school.

210
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

211
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:15,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

212
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:17,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how to feel about that.

213
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:19,634
[SPEAKER_08]: We all should feel old.

214
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:20,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

215
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:21,375
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's class of 2028 then?

216
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:21,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so, yeah.

217
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:22,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

218
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:37,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, as we all slowly get older, let's take a moment to reflect on the last week and talk about how was your gaming week and the types of video games we've been playing this week.

219
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,028
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

220
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:44,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of stuff actually, come to think of it.

221
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:49,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm addicted to one of those Suica games called Fruit Salad.

222
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,436
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the fruit combining game?

223
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I think Alan is playing the same one.

224
00:18:56,397 --> 00:19:00,980
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another one that's called My Suica on my phone, so I have one to go with me.

225
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:06,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also been playing a Mahjong game on the go.

226
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing, of course, Dead by Daylight.

227
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:15,548
[SPEAKER_01]: They've extended the 2v8 play, which is what I will be doing tonight while it lasts.

228
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:18,289
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, be fun to have people join.

229
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:49,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely played a bunch of Baldur's Gate 3 or else I've been calling it Vampire Spawn Dating Sim I put a lot of effort in over the last few days I'm still kind of taking it slow I pick it up when I'm in the mood for it Also, Cult of the Lamb has new DLC coming out so I'm going to be playing that coming up in a couple days

230
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,125
[SPEAKER_01]: God, there's other stuff on my list.

231
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:55,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff I know is playing Polya.

232
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,049
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like my chill laid-back game.

233
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:11,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I also beat the original Japanese PlayStation release for Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight, also known over here as Symphony of the Night.

234
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:15,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing an English translation patch.

235
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:22,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is, but the PlayStation version seems a little slightly harder than the Saturn version.

236
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:24,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.

237
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:26,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting over a sinus infection.

238
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:27,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the tail end.

239
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:30,918
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it wasn't COVID.

240
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, oh gosh, I know I played some other stuff.

241
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened Fortnite for a half second and then closed it again.

242
00:20:42,580 --> 00:21:07,553
[SPEAKER_01]: you know sort of like ah no better not um gosh I know that there was a couple other things that I was playing but I kind of can't be bothered to think of what it was oh yeah and Avatar um my new DLC is out so kind of playing a little bit of that here and there nice okay all right well we'll go over to Loki how was your gaming week

243
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:27,534
[SPEAKER_04]: um it's been mostly just editing um and working on just the theme park stuff so I finished my first attraction which I should have a video I hear very soon um as I finish editing that so I made a dropper ride and that was fun kind of like drop zone and um

244
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:33,509
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have a crazy mouse that's going to be, or wild mouse that's in the next episode.

245
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:36,510
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just slowly working through theme park stuff.

246
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:37,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

247
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:39,452
[SPEAKER_04]: What else happened this week?

248
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:43,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I put a short out for the Roscomber Build-by-Build event.

249
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:46,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had that with all the judges' comments that they made.

250
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,479
[SPEAKER_04]: And gosh, what else?

251
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:53,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

252
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,181
[SPEAKER_04]: More behind-the-scenes stuff, I'm sure.

253
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:55,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

254
00:21:56,991 --> 00:22:02,034
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dragon Fight, and the Frigid SMP thing, which I still have to edit that stuff, too.

255
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:02,674
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much.

256
00:22:02,794 --> 00:22:08,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I did an interview with Inside MCC Live Show again.

257
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:16,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did an interview about a year ago for MCC Rising 2, and they used a follow-up, where are they now type of thing.

258
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:17,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did that today.

259
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:18,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's fun.

260
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:18,584
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.

261
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:20,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good.

262
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:21,025
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

263
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:22,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

264
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:23,626
[SPEAKER_08]: My game of the week.

265
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:27,188
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I love me some Final Fantasy XIV, so I played a little bit of that, of course.

266
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,948
[SPEAKER_08]: What else is new?

267
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:35,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I finally almost have my second battle job, because I have a botanist and alchemist at level 100, along with Sage.

268
00:22:36,614 --> 00:22:38,595
[SPEAKER_08]: But my second job, Astrologian, is almost 100.

269
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm going to probably... I need to finish off Bard.

270
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:43,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I really want to get into tanking.

271
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:44,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm ready to do that.

272
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:47,501
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to polish off Gunbreaker and do that one next.

273
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:49,402
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

274
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:11,623
[SPEAKER_08]: This had nothing to do with Shane's influence because he loves Pokemon.

275
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:12,624
[SPEAKER_08]: He always tries to get me to play it.

276
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,066
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually had nothing to do with this.

277
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:15,768
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one of those things.

278
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:21,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I would say it was me playing Nintendo World Championship on the Switch when that came out.

279
00:23:22,177 --> 00:23:24,220
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of made me realize, I was like, I really...

280
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:26,042
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

281
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:46,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I used Sprigatito as my starter, and I think I got like two, two, two.

282
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I did two of everything, and that was about as far as I got.

283
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,882
[SPEAKER_08]: The second time I played, I didn't get very far at all.

284
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:55,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I did like the intro and maybe a little bit past that with Quaxley, and that was about as far as I got.

285
00:23:55,564 --> 00:24:03,227
[SPEAKER_08]: So now I'm on my third playthrough, and yes, this time I said, all right, it's Fuecoco's time to shine because I tried the other two and didn't...

286
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:05,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Voicoco is my starter this time.

287
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:08,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane said that surprised him the most.

288
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,075
[SPEAKER_08]: He thought I'd go back to Spriggetito.

289
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, no.

290
00:24:12,277 --> 00:24:14,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Logically, I've got to use the one I haven't used yet.

291
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:16,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Voicoco has been my starter this time.

292
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:21,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I am two star bases away.

293
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:24,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Three Titans and three gyms, I think, at this point.

294
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:31,893
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm a little further and really probably going to finish my fourth gym after the show tonight is where I'm at.

295
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,995
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's been, yeah, that's been pretty fun.

296
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,617
[SPEAKER_08]: PodCulture in chat says, Weed Kitty for the win.

297
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:37,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

298
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:39,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Sprigatito is still my fave because, you know, cats.

299
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:42,943
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say, Fuey Coco is actually a really...

300
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:49,247
[SPEAKER_08]: like powerful starter because there's a lot of stuff at the beginning of the game where fire comes in very handy.

301
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:52,369
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been building out a pretty good party.

302
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:57,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the party I've been using right now is, let's see if I can remember, Crocolore, right?

303
00:24:57,152 --> 00:24:57,793
[SPEAKER_08]: The evolution.

304
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:03,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Mudbray, the horse ground type, very powerful.

305
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:07,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I subbed that one in for a jump pluff I was using.

306
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:08,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to fuck up some of these names, sorry.

307
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not...

308
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Tinkertuff Tinkertuff

309
00:25:34,438 --> 00:25:40,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Sinisty, Sinisty, the little teacup, like I'm playing with something from Beauty and the Beast, one of the singing teacups.

310
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:42,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.

311
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:43,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been doing that one.

312
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:45,824
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I can't remember my six Pokemon type.

313
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:47,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember the six one.

314
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:49,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, uh,

315
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:54,170
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

316
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:13,032
[SPEAKER_08]: from before, just because having a ground party member made a lot of sense.

317
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:20,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just caught a Bramble, which is a ghost grass type, so I might sub out my Sinistee for that.

318
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:37,263
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as I love the teacup, like I just love that Pokemon, it's so funny, it might make more topping sense, or it might make more sense as type, typing, coming out on top of the typing to do Bramble instead, or whatever that Pokemon's name is.

319
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:37,923
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

320
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,421
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

321
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:55,518
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

322
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:19,433
[SPEAKER_08]: that some of the celebrities from the Lord of the Rings trilogy are going to be at DragonCon.

323
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Elijah Wood is going to be there.

324
00:27:22,094 --> 00:27:23,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Dominic Monaghan is going to be there.

325
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:24,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Billy Boyd.

326
00:27:24,955 --> 00:27:32,758
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's lots of... The list for this year's DragonCon is pretty damn amazing.

327
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:37,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out DragonCon.org if you haven't seen it yet and I hope to see you there Labor Day weekend for sure.

328
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:41,426
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on into some gaming news.

329
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:45,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go over to Loki with our first headline tonight.

330
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:58,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so not a huge surprise, but of course, with the whole Borderlands movie coming out, a lot of folks are asking Randy Pitchford in part of different interviews promoting the movie.

331
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:01,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, are you working on another Borderlands game?

332
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:02,402
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course...

333
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:06,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they are obviously working on another Borderlands game.

334
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:16,266
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that there are multiple projects in development thanks to a leadership cluster which drives a project from cradle to grave.

335
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that...

336
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:19,676
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that mean exactly?

337
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:27,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So with this approach, we're able to spin up multiple things, including a new Brothers in Arms game, which has been in development for a while.

338
00:28:28,678 --> 00:28:30,238
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not ready to talk about it.

339
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:34,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we're working on every IP.

340
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:38,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we just launched Homeworld 3, and there's still work going on there.

341
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's Risk of Rain, and there's Duke Nukem, and there's more.

342
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,221
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making another Duke Nukem game?

343
00:28:47,409 --> 00:29:13,111
[SPEAKER_04]: okay how brave I'm sure I mean we're far enough away from Duke Nukem Forever where I think the the the franchise deserves another shot yeah yeah I think if you reboot it and you can get like some of those people that were making those new um oh gosh basically kind of like uh the whole

344
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:35,636
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of the other games that are using the build engine but kind of making it a little bit more modern I think would be really cool to see like a new build version of Duke Nukem just keep it like kind of retro like that but eh check it out but eh

345
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

346
00:29:38,955 --> 00:29:40,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke Nukem Forever is really bad.

347
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:43,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It is really bad.

348
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:47,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Some game franchises have a stinker amongst them.

349
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:48,039
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens.

350
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:48,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

351
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,140
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give it a chance when it comes out.

352
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:57,143
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as Borderlands goes, it's nice that the franchise is getting some good news this week because the movie hoofed

353
00:29:58,957 --> 00:29:59,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck good.

354
00:29:59,977 --> 00:30:00,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see the movie.

355
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:01,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Full disclosure.

356
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:02,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not see the movie.

357
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:06,499
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have friends that went and saw and none of them had anything nice to say about it.

358
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And like these are friends that can appreciate like a bad movie like Showgirls bad.

359
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:13,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Not hearing good things about Borderlands.

360
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,541
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently, you know what?

361
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:19,823
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to say I'm full of shit, that's fine too because the box office receipts not looking good.

362
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:20,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it made what?

363
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:20,943
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 million?

364
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:24,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, somewhere between 8 and 9 million this weekend on a $120 budget. $115,000.

365
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,880
[SPEAKER_04]: or $150 million budget.

366
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,740
[SPEAKER_01]: That I didn't even know it was coming out.

367
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:36,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, number one, why do you put a big movie out during the Olympics?

368
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:43,925
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like again, I mean, I know not everybody watches the Olympics, but enough people do where it's going to that's going to bite into it a little bit.

369
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:46,086
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just I'm just surprised.

370
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:49,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't forget the big, the big, big, big, big one.

371
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:49,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

372
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:51,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Deadpool and Wolverine.

373
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:51,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

374
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:52,436
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to compete.

375
00:30:52,536 --> 00:30:53,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's true, too.

376
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:56,999
[SPEAKER_08]: That movie is doing really good business and has really good word of mouth.

377
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

378
00:30:58,921 --> 00:31:01,243
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest R-rated movie yet, right?

379
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:07,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think I heard it made more money than The Passion of the Christ, which up until date was the biggest R-rated movie.

380
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:10,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, we have Marvel Jesus.

381
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:13,492
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not going to spoil.

382
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:14,153
[SPEAKER_01]: No spoilers.

383
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:39,766
[SPEAKER_08]: so yeah so there's that uh E3VL in chat points out Alien Romulus next week yeah and that's now going to be after the Olympics and I think there's oh my god I think there's probably more people interested in that um so I think you guys have no idea how excited I am for Alien Romulus yeah what do you think about the you know the well I maybe I shouldn't be talking about leaks sorry but the character's been leaked for DBD as an Ellen Ripley legendary

384
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:41,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.

385
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:43,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I didn't know.

386
00:31:43,713 --> 00:31:44,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprise!

387
00:31:44,354 --> 00:31:51,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't really... I know a few things about the movie already because I've been following alien theory.

388
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:56,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think the main character is... I don't want to spoil what I know, though.

389
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's fair.

390
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:02,386
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw on chat says, I've been seeing a lot of commercials for Wicked.

391
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:04,187
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to get me back in a movie theater.

392
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:06,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't tell you the last time I saw a new movie.

393
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:14,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, with the horror stuff, I see Colton horror and those type of niche movies all the time, but I don't really get out and see new movies very often.

394
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:15,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Come with me and see Deadpool.

395
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:18,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be seated for Wicked.

396
00:32:18,218 --> 00:32:19,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I need to see the others?

397
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:21,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've literally never seen a Deadpool movie.

398
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen a Marvel movie since the first Avengers movie.

399
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:24,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

400
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:25,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

401
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,024
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some jokes, but not really.

402
00:32:27,084 --> 00:32:33,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a few characters' appearances, but honestly, they're all so good.

403
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:37,013
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all... I love them all.

404
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:38,114
[SPEAKER_01]: They are perfect.

405
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:43,418
[SPEAKER_01]: For someone who read Deadpool ever since he was in New Mutants back in the... What was it?

406
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,140
[SPEAKER_01]: The late 90s?

407
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:45,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Early 90s?

408
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:47,202
[SPEAKER_04]: The olden times.

409
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:51,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the olden times when Liefeld actually was drawing the characters.

410
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:55,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and the Liefeld jabs were perfect.

411
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to say that right now.

412
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:05,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just say I'm laughing because with Loki's green screen effect, he was reaching behind him to grab something, I don't know, like a soda or something, and it looked like he was smacking the people going into his park.

413
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:10,279
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like he was reaching behind and smacking the people and like, get out.

414
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of my park.

415
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,482
[SPEAKER_08]: We're closed.

416
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:24,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Cartman in the theme park where he bought the theme park but only allowed himself to go on the rides.

417
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:27,257
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

418
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:31,858
[SPEAKER_08]: QuestBuster in chat says the Deadpool films are a lot of fun even if you have no idea what the comics are.

419
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:34,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally, I like Ryan Reynolds a lot.

420
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:39,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not like his sitcom he had on ABC years ago, the Pizza Place thing.

421
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:43,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not like that show at all, but I generally think he's pretty funny.

422
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:45,023
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

423
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I need to see Deadpool at some point.

424
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:53,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just your super uncool uncle that plays Final Fantasy XIV all day.

425
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:54,355
Bob.

426
00:33:54,755 --> 00:33:55,016
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

427
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:56,356
[SPEAKER_01]: You're coming over.

428
00:33:57,757 --> 00:33:58,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I can play pinball at least.

429
00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:03,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And watch, you're coming over for a Deadpool movie a night.

430
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:04,367
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

431
00:34:04,387 --> 00:34:07,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hopefully we can squeeze it in before DragonCon.

432
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, it's going to be like a month.

433
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,233
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, we'll have to make it work.

434
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:12,155
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

435
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:13,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

436
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:15,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into gaming news.

437
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:21,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I mentioned earlier there was one other game I played this week, and it's something that just came out.

438
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:25,849
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a new enhanced version of Doom and Doom 2.

439
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:35,632
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, QuakeCon 2024 happened this past weekend, and usually there is something happening with Bethesda's various IPs, ZeniMax specifically.

440
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:41,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been Quake the last couple of years, but Doom and Doom 2 is being re-released.

441
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:46,255
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been spotted in a new Steam listing, but they have come out and acknowledged this.

442
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:49,696
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also get this on the Xbox ecosystem because it's on Game Pass.

443
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:52,197
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I played it, actually, was PC Game Pass.

444
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:57,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is now using the games running on the KEX engine.

445
00:34:57,942 --> 00:35:02,947
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an engine that was used in other re-releases that ZeniMax has done over the years.

446
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:06,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Doom 64, Quake, and Quake 2 when they did those.

447
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:15,300
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, even though they just re-released Doom and Doom 2, it feels like within this latest console era, because I know they had the version that supported mods, they are doing it again.

448
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the really cool news.

449
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,901
[SPEAKER_08]: If you owned one of those older versions, you're getting it upgraded.

450
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:25,642
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're not like, it's not like, I can't sit here and say, oh, it's a scheme to get you to buy it again.

451
00:35:25,662 --> 00:35:27,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the nice thing is, it is upgraded.

452
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:32,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And it includes, if you want to play those original versions, those are there as well.

453
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:35,065
[SPEAKER_08]: So can't bitch about that.

454
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:36,585
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing a lot of the right things here.

455
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:43,189
[SPEAKER_08]: What's also really cool about it is that now they have cross-platform deathmatch up to 16 players.

456
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:52,855
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a brand new soundtrack in the game, and I was playing, it's very loud, very metal, as it ought to be, very like Dragon Force-esque, but

457
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:57,337
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what you'd want.

458
00:35:57,638 --> 00:35:59,218
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was very happy with that.

459
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:07,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And then multi-threaded rendering supporting up to 4K resolution because you know Doom is the game you wallies wanted to see in 4K.

460
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:11,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I really can't bitch.

461
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:12,179
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's really cool.

462
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:13,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And it actually has...

463
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:26,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Other content.

464
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:35,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the menu, when you go in and pick, you can pick original Doom, Doom 2, but you could also pick other campaigns that they've, I believe, released before.

465
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,283
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a brand new one, Legacy of Rust, which is a new episode for Doom 2.

466
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:45,007
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually been made by ID Software, Night Dive Studios, and Machine Games.

467
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:47,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And they actually have new monster types in that, which is pretty cool.

468
00:36:48,149 --> 00:36:51,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, if you're a Doom fan, this release is pretty cool.

469
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:59,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play it for a hot minute, and I will tell you, one thing I noticed, it runs fast.

470
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:01,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Fast.

471
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:11,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I was playing, I don't usually get motion sick or any of that stuff playing games, but when I was playing Doom and going full speed, I had to go like, whoo, whoo, this is...

472
00:37:12,537 --> 00:37:41,157
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a lot I'm surprised I remember as many codes as I do so you know I've never tried to use some of those codes on this new version I don't see why they wouldn't work though they should I was also saying had the Wolfenstein level map 31 it was different on one of the versions I think the Game Boy Advance version was a different map but eh

473
00:37:43,252 --> 00:38:11,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox had a specific map too in one of them so yeah I'm actually really amazed that I remember any of them and then there was like the secret level IDCLEV19 I think I used to love when people would make their own custom maps and that shit and I know that had to be something Loki did at some point in his life was making custom maps for either Wolfenstein or Doom Quake was the big one though I loved Quake

474
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:18,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not for Doom because I could never really get Doom to run on my PC at the time.

475
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:27,855
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did do Wolf of the Sun maps and we made Wolf of the Sun like re-textured things.

476
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:32,056
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did do that in the build engine with Duke Nukem 3D.

477
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:33,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We did make custom maps.

478
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:35,637
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

479
00:38:35,677 --> 00:38:38,217
[SPEAKER_04]: The one I can remember is it was a water park.

480
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:40,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Water park, kind of.

481
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:40,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

482
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:55,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It had, like, a lot of moving water, and there was a part that had a really long drop because there was a button to lower the map, and there was a raise the map, and there was no... Oh, that was the thing in Duke Nukem, too, in the map editor.

483
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:56,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

484
00:38:56,636 --> 00:39:05,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was no limit, so, like, I would just put a paperweight down on the page down button or something like that, go have lunch, then come back, and then I have a five-minute drop now.

485
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I remember making... Which I thought it was cool at the time.

486
00:39:09,803 --> 00:39:15,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember making a Duke Nukem multiplayer map that started where the spawns were just a giant drop.

487
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:19,016
[SPEAKER_08]: And you fell in the water or something, so you didn't get damaged.

488
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:23,763
[SPEAKER_08]: So every time you respawned, you had to wait for like a 30-second drop to get back.

489
00:39:23,783 --> 00:39:24,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the match, it was pretty fun.

490
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:41,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at the very end, for no reason, I don't know, I just thought that was funny, but then there's a super fast elevator going up, but if you hit the elevator just wrong, you could just die from how fast it's going, it would just crush you, and try to get spiky ceilings to crush you.

491
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That didn't really work that well, but yeah, it was fun.

492
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:48,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got cartridges laying around for the SNES version and Doom 64.

493
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,125
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

494
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:35,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Performance improvements and rumble support if you have the all new controller for it.

495
00:40:36,107 --> 00:40:41,072
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a custom chip that helps to replicate what the Super FX chip did.

496
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:42,153
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty cool.

497
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,235
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a standard edition and a collector's edition.

498
00:40:44,615 --> 00:40:46,517
[SPEAKER_08]: And the collector's edition is limited.

499
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only going to have, of course, 666 copies.

500
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:53,543
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

501
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:16,846
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

502
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:54,754
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we have been talking about the games we wanted Capcom to re-release for an age, and they have a goal.

503
00:41:54,774 --> 00:41:57,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important to all of our voices, you know?

504
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:02,444
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make all of their old fighting games available again.

505
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:17,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Matsumoto Shuhei revealed that they were trying to bring everything back to modern platforms so that they could make longtime fans and newcomers feel happy about it.

506
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:18,470
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the classics.

507
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:28,393
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the Marvel vs. Capcom fighting collection, the Arcade Classics.

508
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:31,394
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be out on PlayStation, Switch, and Steam.

509
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:41,405
[SPEAKER_01]: that has six fighting games and an arcade brawler and then the SNK vs. Capcom SVC Chaos release that we talked about before.

510
00:42:43,547 --> 00:42:53,112
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fighting collection will be missing Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and we won't have any Tatsunoko vs. Capcom on it.

511
00:42:53,312 --> 00:43:02,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if they really want to go all out, we need a Justice Gakuen series or as we had at Rival Schools.

512
00:43:03,158 --> 00:43:04,900
[SPEAKER_01]: We need Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

513
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,841
[SPEAKER_01]: We need Red Earth.

514
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:08,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We need just all of them.

515
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:11,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to it.

516
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:18,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I do super love Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

517
00:43:20,073 --> 00:43:21,074
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.

518
00:43:21,274 --> 00:43:22,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I like some of the obscure ones as well.

519
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:29,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

520
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:29,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

521
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was talking when I was muted.

522
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:32,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

523
00:43:32,715 --> 00:43:35,736
[SPEAKER_08]: S200 Matt in chat says, would love some Capcom versus SNK 2.

524
00:43:36,276 --> 00:43:38,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, a big, strong agree with that one as well.

525
00:43:39,537 --> 00:43:43,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Suya does, you know, level set expectations saying, I mean, we're just getting Marvel 2.

526
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I know folks want the Rival Schools Project Justice games.

527
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,801
[SPEAKER_08]: There's definitely still stuff left to do.

528
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:49,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

529
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:57,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Would love to see both of those brought up for like modern graphics, you know, give them like the Street Fighter 5 treatment, you know.

530
00:43:58,064 --> 00:43:58,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

531
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,254
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be pretty cool.

532
00:44:01,795 --> 00:44:04,097
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on to our next story, Loki.

533
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:10,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I'm not the only one that forgets the mute button when I'm trying to type.

534
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

535
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:22,419
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we got an announcement now from Saber Interactive and Paramount Pictures that Quiet Place, the road ahead, is now launching October 17th.

536
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:30,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, I didn't even realize the game was announced back in 2021, but it's a story-based Quiet Place game.

537
00:44:30,482 --> 00:44:34,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks creepy, but yeah, we'll have to see what it ends up...

538
00:44:35,664 --> 00:44:36,805
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's going to be good or not.

539
00:44:36,825 --> 00:44:42,149
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.

540
00:44:42,229 --> 00:44:48,813
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cost $30, which is a little bit more digestible than a AAA $70 game.

541
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:52,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, curious to see what that looks like.

542
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:59,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if that's going to be kind of timed for the streaming release of the new Quiet Place movie, because I think that just came out.

543
00:45:00,738 --> 00:45:05,621
[SPEAKER_08]: yes it was like a quiet place which by the way I've never seen the movies am I missing out are they good movies?

544
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:28,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the first one they're pretty good and then yeah I think there's an actual quiet place part 3 coming too if I remember what I read right it's funny these feel more like you know how there was like a whole bunch of movies that they kept like kind of inserting into the um oh god what was that um

545
00:45:30,407 --> 00:45:58,243
[SPEAKER_04]: that found footage alien movie um oh I can't remember now um oh Cloverfield uh yeah there's remember how there's a bunch of movies that like kind of felt like uh getting shoehorned into like the Cloverfield type stuff the Quiet Place actually feels like it should be part of that universe but it's not it's kind of like it's got it's own lore so they've had like two movies already that are sequels and now they just released a prequel movie

546
00:45:58,783 --> 00:45:59,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Day 1, Day 0

547
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:20,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

548
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:23,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I read a lot of internet, but I don't always remember it correctly.

549
00:46:25,463 --> 00:46:29,066
[SPEAKER_08]: And people lie on the internet, too, is a very important thing to see.

550
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:35,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw on Facebook today, I saw a very well-done but fake Friends reunion trailer.

551
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:39,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, they went to the extent to cut all of the actors out of other movies.

552
00:46:39,874 --> 00:46:43,097
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could tell right off the bat because I was like, oh, that's Courtney Cox in Scream.

553
00:46:43,397 --> 00:46:45,138
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a shot from the Scream movie, from Scream 5.

554
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:47,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, this isn't real.

555
00:46:48,761 --> 00:46:56,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they used AI to put them all in a scene together where they looked like they were at a funeral for Chandler or whichever.

556
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Chandler was the one that passed away.

557
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:01,109
[SPEAKER_08]: But the whole thing was super cut.

558
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:03,410
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like a legit presentation on Max.

559
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:09,054
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's all a lie because the minute you kind of pick out, no, that's Scream 5, then that's it.

560
00:47:09,774 --> 00:47:11,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it's fake.

561
00:47:12,356 --> 00:47:15,438
[SPEAKER_08]: People lie on the internet and they go at great lengths to lie.

562
00:47:16,198 --> 00:47:16,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

563
00:47:16,438 --> 00:47:16,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

564
00:47:41,474 --> 00:47:46,339
[SPEAKER_01]: and doing them all with AI and seeing how disastrous they turn out.

565
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:47,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

566
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,861
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hilarious.

567
00:47:49,021 --> 00:47:59,572
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a... Crap, I can't remember the name that had... Perfect Strangers.

568
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:06,983
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a Perfect Strangers one that is actually so terrible.

569
00:48:07,123 --> 00:48:08,364
[SPEAKER_01]: All the ones they did are so terrible.

570
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:10,826
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Perfect Strangers and something else.

571
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:12,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

572
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:18,793
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're done that way on purpose and show exactly how bad generative AI is.

573
00:48:19,013 --> 00:48:19,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I've seen it.

574
00:48:19,793 --> 00:48:26,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It had nothing to do with AI, but I saw a different one for Perfect Strangers where they recut it to make it look like a slasher flick.

575
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:27,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was funny.

576
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:34,924
[SPEAKER_08]: I like when they recut things to make them look like the wrong genre.

577
00:48:35,464 --> 00:48:41,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen them do Terrifier to look like a comedy and that type of stuff is great.

578
00:48:42,448 --> 00:48:46,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was one for Hereditary that looked like a comedy too and I don't even know how they got away with that.

579
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see that one?

580
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:51,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know I love both of those movies.

581
00:48:51,572 --> 00:48:52,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Hereditary and

582
00:48:52,955 --> 00:49:00,983
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw says it wasn't AI generated because one of the things I have seen are fake movie trailers that's generated by AI, trailers for movies that don't exist.

583
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,744
[SPEAKER_08]: This particular thing I saw used both.

584
00:49:13,354 --> 00:49:18,800
[SPEAKER_08]: It was definitely like... And I could tell there was this scene where it looked like they were all at a funeral and the heads had been imposed.

585
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:20,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe one of them was real.

586
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:22,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It was probably from another movie that one of them started.

587
00:49:22,985 --> 00:49:24,527
[SPEAKER_08]: But the heads were definitely superimposed.

588
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:25,848
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just tell like that, right?

589
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:26,689
[SPEAKER_08]: And then...

590
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:35,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it was the – but they would super cut in the actors in other movies in scenes that looked like it could play into this.

591
00:49:36,297 --> 00:49:43,322
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there were scenes of Courtney Cox from Scream 5 and probably Scream 6 where I was – but that was the giveaway for me.

592
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:44,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, that's from Scream.

593
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:46,304
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not from anything else.

594
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:47,065
[SPEAKER_08]: So –

595
00:49:47,825 --> 00:49:49,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

596
00:49:49,347 --> 00:49:54,672
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called, the channel, by the way, is Rocky Bergen, B-E-R-G-E-N.

597
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:58,196
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely hilarious and really terrible.

598
00:49:59,181 --> 00:50:00,302
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

599
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:49,434
[SPEAKER_08]: But Game Informer is, of course, you know, had its fans And they are trying to preserve the legacy of the Game Informer magazine online Because as you know, the whole site got shut down The whole damn archives and all the articles, gone The social media, gone I mean, we went into it last week I don't need to dredge up all that Because, you know, obviously it left a bad taste in our mouth So trying to look at the good news out of this Retromags.com

600
00:50:50,254 --> 00:50:55,495
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've seen this site before, but I'm glad I'm reminded that this is a thing because this is a lot of fun.

601
00:50:55,975 --> 00:51:04,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Retro Mags hosts community submitted scans of classic video game magazines, and they have put a huge archive of Game Informer issues live.

602
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:09,118
[SPEAKER_08]: They have right now issue one all the way to issue 260 from December of 2014.

603
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:12,640
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty cool.

604
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,365
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to go back and look at the legacy of Game Informer, that's a great way to do it.

605
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:24,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to Retro Mags, who is interested in preserving gaming history when GameStop are being a bunch of fucking assholes about it.

606
00:51:24,754 --> 00:51:26,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So specifically the CEO.

607
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically the CEO.

608
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:57,734
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically, asshole I'm wondering though if they're doing this as some sort of tax write-off purpose because Cartoon Network or Adult Swim just recently had, I think it was Cartoon Network had, when they pulled all that stuff, they also wiped the entire website of things as well so that it can't be searched anymore I'm wondering if they have to do that so they can write it off as a loss and get a tax break on it

609
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:00,605
[SPEAKER_04]: which shouldn't be allowed anyways.

610
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:07,854
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have all these assets and I just throw them in the trash, I shouldn't get to write that off.

611
00:52:08,014 --> 00:52:13,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've said this before on the show because I've said it about these movies that keep getting taxed right off, which

612
00:52:14,662 --> 00:52:16,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Borderlands probably should have been.

613
00:52:16,283 --> 00:52:17,743
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the thing.

614
00:52:17,823 --> 00:52:26,187
[SPEAKER_08]: When companies write these off and they use it to write off their public debt, what they are using to write off their public debt then should become public property.

615
00:52:26,587 --> 00:52:27,948
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how it ought to work.

616
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:32,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So these Game Informer magazines, it ought to become public domain at this point.

617
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we all know it isn't going to work that way, but it should.

618
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:41,574
[SPEAKER_04]: If the taxpayers are paying for their loss, then it should be ours.

619
00:52:42,486 --> 00:52:43,407
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura

620
00:53:08,906 --> 00:53:15,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonic Generations, a game that is, I would say, pretty well loved.

621
00:53:17,633 --> 00:53:26,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going to be withdrawn from sale as a standalone title.

622
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:36,549
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's going to happen is that they are going to be including it with bundles.

623
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:57,565
[SPEAKER_01]: especially since it's part of the Sonic X Shadow Generations game I don't like necessarily but this is what they're saying is their way of preserving the title

624
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:02,786
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be part of bundles on Steam and Xbox.

625
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:13,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you already own the copy, you can still download it and that the mods on the Steam version will not be affected, is what they said.

626
00:54:14,817 --> 00:54:15,598
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.

627
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:18,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is happening on September 9th.

628
00:54:19,462 --> 00:54:21,224
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to remember what else happened on September 9th.

629
00:54:23,452 --> 00:54:43,962
[SPEAKER_08]: uh a video game system yes that speaking of politics apparently it came out that our democratic vice presidential nominee was a dreamcast person which i think is pretty cool i mean yeah there's as if you needed another reason he's also gonna help us do our house chores if the internet is to be believed probably

630
00:54:46,593 --> 00:54:48,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, yeah, Jamie, I'm kind of with you.

631
00:54:48,754 --> 00:54:51,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Something about this feels very off.

632
00:54:51,514 --> 00:54:56,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm glad the game is continuing and is being preserved.

633
00:54:56,736 --> 00:54:58,376
[SPEAKER_08]: It does seem a little shady.

634
00:54:58,516 --> 00:55:02,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, but I understand there comes a point where you're literally not selling copies of this game anymore.

635
00:55:03,197 --> 00:55:07,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe it does cost more to keep the lights on, you know, and this is their way of doing it.

636
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:10,119
[SPEAKER_08]: It just feels weird.

637
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:11,259
[SPEAKER_08]: But are there servers?

638
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:13,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there online servers for the game?

639
00:55:15,197 --> 00:55:28,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this was like their replacement for like an equivalent yeah yeah, I guess there is that I mean, I don't know thank god I have it in my library

640
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:33,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like gaming corporation being corporate about stuff.

641
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:40,973
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, at this point, it's like, of course you're going to corporate, because of course, you know, this is what you do, this is what corporations do.

642
00:55:41,514 --> 00:55:43,556
[SPEAKER_04]: They be corporating all over the place.

643
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:44,938
[SPEAKER_08]: They be corporating all over.

644
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:47,541
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just...

645
00:55:48,689 --> 00:55:49,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

646
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:54,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to assume any decision corporations make are evil.

647
00:55:54,154 --> 00:56:02,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, let's see what nefarious purpose this is meant to cause or be for.

648
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:02,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

649
00:56:04,214 --> 00:56:08,676
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, you just have to spend $60 to buy the one game you want.

650
00:56:09,037 --> 00:56:13,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, side, you get Sonic Spinball for the 12th time from various collections.

651
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:14,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, that's so true.

652
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,541
[SPEAKER_01]: To go along with the 12 actual copies I actually own.

653
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:21,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, to go along with your Doom 2 re-release and your Yars Revenge re-release.

654
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:27,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, just add that to the list of games that you can play 5,000 different ways, right?

655
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:28,306
[SPEAKER_08]: So, ugh.

656
00:56:29,146 --> 00:56:31,749
[SPEAKER_08]: S200 Mats is waiting for the Sonic Spinball remake.

657
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:35,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you joke, but that should actually be a thing.

658
00:56:36,134 --> 00:56:37,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that should actually be a thing.

659
00:56:39,878 --> 00:56:40,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

660
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, whether I like it or not, this next thing is going to be a thing.

661
00:56:44,302 --> 00:56:44,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

662
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:58,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, so apparently, like I didn't realize it was that popular, and it was popular in like Game Pass and stuff, but you may remember there was a game called High on Life by Squanch Games.

663
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:02,643
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of this weird FPS thing with talking guns.

664
00:57:02,663 --> 00:57:04,925
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the Rick and Morty talking gun thing, right?

665
00:57:05,045 --> 00:57:09,008
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Rick and Morty talking gun thing, of course, you know.

666
00:57:09,848 --> 00:57:12,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have one of the game's actors, J.B.

667
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:21,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Smooth, who is actually forming a production studio to make an animated TV show based off of the IP.

668
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:28,673
[SPEAKER_04]: They are apparently working with, yeah, it's his alternative side productions.

669
00:57:29,753 --> 00:57:37,518
[SPEAKER_04]: And he is working along with Russell Binder and Mandy Bartisabanian and Striker Entertainment.

670
00:57:37,658 --> 00:57:39,839
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be serving as the producers.

671
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:46,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Alec Robbins, the narrative director on High Life, is also working on the show.

672
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:53,111
[SPEAKER_04]: and he says Squanch Games invited me to join them in the gaming universe and now I'm helping them move into the TV world.

673
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:59,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a case of the game of game recognizing game said Jay Smoove.

674
00:58:01,802 --> 00:58:02,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Neat.

675
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:03,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be another show I don't watch.

676
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:11,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, you know, especially with the connection to Rick and Morty and everything, it does kind of make sense that this would be something that would go to a TV show.

677
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess maybe like I'd already forgotten about the game.

678
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:16,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I noticed it when it came out, but I kind of already forgot about it.

679
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,020
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess I too was surprised the game did that well.

680
00:58:19,761 --> 00:58:27,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's better to put out a TV show a few years from when the game comes out instead of like, you know, adapting something.

681
00:58:28,526 --> 00:58:29,007
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years ago.

682
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Ouch, true.

683
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:02,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's talk about this.

684
00:59:02,702 --> 00:59:04,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this could be an awesome collaboration.

685
00:59:04,763 --> 00:59:06,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it'll ever happen.

686
00:59:06,423 --> 00:59:09,485
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, somebody had to ask the question and get the rumors started.

687
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:14,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has to do with Digital Eclipse, which of course has been nailing a lot of recent compilations, right?

688
00:59:14,647 --> 00:59:17,749
[SPEAKER_08]: They did the Mega Man Legacy compilations, Atari 50.

689
00:59:18,529 --> 00:59:20,890
[SPEAKER_08]: They did the Ninja Turtles Cowabunga collection.

690
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:23,131
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they've been doing a lot of like really good stuff lately, right?

691
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:23,892
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

692
00:59:24,952 --> 00:59:28,494
[SPEAKER_08]: The company has teamed up with Japanese companies in the past.

693
00:59:28,915 --> 00:59:32,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So could they do something with Nintendo first party sources?

694
00:59:33,858 --> 00:59:41,463
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something where there was an interview that happened with Chris Kohler from Digital Eclipse in an interview with VGC.

695
00:59:42,924 --> 00:59:48,468
[SPEAKER_08]: When asked by VGC, speaking of white gloves, presumably Nintendo isn't interested in a collaboration yet.

696
00:59:48,928 --> 00:59:56,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And the response, well, you know, historically, Other Ocean, who previously owned Digital Eclipse, did Minecraft 3DS Edition for Nintendo.

697
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:59,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've done stuff for Nintendo as a company historically and in the past.

698
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,771
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think the door is closed.

699
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,711
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we'll see what the future will bring.

700
01:00:04,051 --> 01:00:06,252
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly nothing is in development at this time.

701
01:00:07,912 --> 01:00:15,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a very politically correct walking the line answer of not like killing hopes for a Nintendo collab, but making it very clear that's not on the table right now.

702
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:22,297
[SPEAKER_08]: There was another question asked about a collaboration with like Night Dive Studios of Turok and Quake.

703
01:00:23,697 --> 01:00:31,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the response, he said, they're about games that are a little bit later on in terms of, whereas we're essentially about integrating emulator-based solutions into our engine.

704
01:00:32,363 --> 01:00:39,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you, Nintendo, but with the Nintendo Switch, it's getting on in years and it's more difficult to emulate later platforms and have them be performant on the Switch.

705
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:43,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's a little bit of a division there in terms of what we're doing.

706
01:00:43,951 --> 01:00:44,812
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

707
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,811
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a disaster, alright.

708
01:01:07,851 --> 01:01:09,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you got half the words right.

709
01:01:09,112 --> 01:01:09,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen it?

710
01:01:10,552 --> 01:01:11,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it campy enough to you?

711
01:01:11,913 --> 01:01:12,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if it's campy?

712
01:01:13,134 --> 01:01:14,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen it, so I don't know.

713
01:01:14,635 --> 01:01:15,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just asking.

714
01:01:16,456 --> 01:01:17,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it really camp?

715
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:19,857
[SPEAKER_04]: But was it fashion?

716
01:01:19,937 --> 01:01:23,039
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably a better director's cut in there somewhere.

717
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:31,483
[SPEAKER_04]: But they, because they had to make some more alterations because of those PG-13 rules, they had a lot of heads exploding, apparently.

718
01:01:32,684 --> 01:01:34,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see a rated R cut of it.

719
01:01:34,943 --> 01:01:38,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, or Director's Cut would be a lot better but yeah, it's not going to be

720
01:01:40,779 --> 01:01:44,302
[SPEAKER_08]: S2100Matt also says, Digital Eclipse and Nintendo would make wonderful babies.

721
01:01:44,922 --> 01:01:47,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm totally down for shipping that into reality.

722
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:56,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love that too, but I feel like Nintendo has done all the walks down memory lane themselves, especially when you look at things like the Nintendo World Championships that just released.

723
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:59,912
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that is their version of celebrating the retro classics.

724
01:02:00,373 --> 01:02:07,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to see something that takes a look at it from the angle like, you know, the Gold Master Series, you know, the making of Karateka

725
01:02:07,938 --> 01:02:26,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeff Minter I don't think they've announced a third one yet but I'm sure there will be one eventually I would love to see something that looks like that for Nintendo I think Nintendo fans would eat that shit up I think that I would be amazing can you imagine getting to see like development documents for a game like let's say like Metroid

726
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:35,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say the Nintendo was like Metroid and you could see like sketches of the maps or, you know, what monsters looking in the early times and really hearing about how that went through.

727
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,821
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, oh my God, Nintendo fans would eat that up.

728
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:44,302
[SPEAKER_08]: But I feel like Nintendo is never going to trust an American company to do it.

729
01:02:45,782 --> 01:02:47,623
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just the reality of how Nintendo works.

730
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:53,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love nothing more than to be proven wrong.

731
01:02:53,435 --> 01:02:55,656
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Digital Eclipse has proven that they can do it.

732
01:02:55,676 --> 01:02:58,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Because again, those Gold Master Series games that are out right now are great.

733
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:04,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Atari 50, although not technically Gold Master Series, is basically Gold Master Series Zero.

734
01:03:04,459 --> 01:03:05,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And that one's great too.

735
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,460
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

736
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,622
[SPEAKER_08]: SG100Matt says, Miyamoto presenting behind the scenes of stuff from old NES games while playing the game.

737
01:03:12,662 --> 01:03:12,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Gimme.

738
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:13,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

739
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:14,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

740
01:03:15,163 --> 01:03:22,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, please let these get this on film before we lose these people.

741
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:27,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I know this is horrible to talk about, but like we've already lost Iwata.

742
01:03:27,672 --> 01:03:29,994
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already lost, you know, Gunpei.

743
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:32,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we've lost a lot of people already.

744
01:03:33,637 --> 01:03:35,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and people are not getting any younger.

745
01:03:35,859 --> 01:03:40,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, you know, Nintendo, please, please take the game preservation seriously.

746
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:43,805
[SPEAKER_08]: The entire enchilada, the entirety of it.

747
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:45,968
[SPEAKER_08]: and commit it to film.

748
01:03:46,008 --> 01:03:47,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Commit it to preservation before it's too late.

749
01:03:47,968 --> 01:03:48,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I beg you.

750
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:51,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if you don't go with digital clips, you don't.

751
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,171
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least look at what they're doing and go, shit, we ought to do something like that.

752
01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:56,972
[SPEAKER_08]: We ought to build that in-house.

753
01:03:57,072 --> 01:03:57,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Our fans would love this.

754
01:03:59,914 --> 01:04:00,154
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

755
01:04:00,614 --> 01:04:03,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that's my ugly begging of the week.

756
01:04:04,856 --> 01:04:10,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of the week, we have another segment of the week we'd like to get to right now.

757
01:04:20,808 --> 01:04:28,113
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

758
01:04:28,553 --> 01:04:31,075
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

759
01:04:32,015 --> 01:04:36,478
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, DarkSakura, what did you pick this week for the classic game of the week?

760
01:04:37,899 --> 01:04:39,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked Thunder Force.

761
01:04:40,841 --> 01:04:43,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Not two, not three, which apparently I've done twice.

762
01:04:44,823 --> 01:04:45,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Not four or five.

763
01:04:46,784 --> 01:04:47,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the first one.

764
01:04:49,144 --> 01:04:51,507
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you have played the original Thunder Force?

765
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:58,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I have never, actually, although I already see similarities to other games I've played, so influence, but never the original.

766
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:06,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so basically the original Thunder Force was a sort of free roaming, scrolling shooter game.

767
01:05:07,718 --> 01:05:12,482
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was released by Technosoft in 1983 and it was the first of the series.

768
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:22,791
[SPEAKER_01]: It was originally released for the X1 computer and later on for the Sharp MZ-1500, the PC-6001 Mark II and in 1985 it came out for the PC-8801 Mark II.

769
01:05:30,097 --> 01:05:58,857
[SPEAKER_01]: and in 1984 we had a release for the FM7 and PC9801 computers as Thunder Force Construction that had an add-on, had a level generator level editor and game creation system and yeah, Quest Buster the first one a lot of people played was Thunder Force 2 and aspects from this game made it into Thunder Force 2 but after 3 came out it was like Thunder Force, we don't know, huh?

770
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:20,522
[SPEAKER_01]: so basically you have to you fly around and over these occupied areas and destroy base installations and tunnels um there's different shield generators you have to get them under the these targets that are on the ground and then you after you destroy all the shield generators then you can move on um

771
01:06:22,003 --> 01:06:49,974
[SPEAKER_01]: and then once the entire section is destroyed the Dryadizer which is like the the big enemy thing it'll vanish and then you'll move on to the next area to keep playing you are going against the Orn Empire and they are going on that fortress, the Dryadizer it moves every time and basically you're going to go blow that up and knock them out of the place you were playing the Fire Leo

772
01:06:51,755 --> 01:07:09,246
[SPEAKER_01]: it was created by Yoshimura Kotori who left Technosoft and founded Arsys Software in 1985 so this is a lady game designer in the 80s so thank you ma'am

773
01:07:10,346 --> 01:07:19,973
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1984, and I mentioned this earlier, Technosoft did a level editor, or what they were calling a game creation system, called Thunder Force Construction.

774
01:07:20,613 --> 01:07:26,798
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also directly created by Yoshimura for the FM7 computer.

775
01:07:27,938 --> 01:07:31,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what is... Why am I even going to this one?

776
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:32,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Because...

777
01:07:34,124 --> 01:07:36,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair's like hardly any good version of this game.

778
01:07:36,205 --> 01:07:36,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put it right now.

779
01:07:37,106 --> 01:07:37,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't enjoy it.

780
01:07:37,826 --> 01:07:38,246
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fun.

781
01:07:39,427 --> 01:07:40,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and tried it.

782
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:44,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mention it in my week, but it's hard.

783
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:47,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not my kind of game.

784
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:59,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But without this game, we would never have had the amazing series of shooter games that we have now with the epic music, especially Thunder Force 3.

785
01:07:59,997 --> 01:08:00,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

786
01:08:03,214 --> 01:08:07,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, and don't forget the weird Super Nintendo one.

787
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:17,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So Thunder Force 3 came out on Mega Drive and then got ported to arcade and that arcade version got ported back to the Super Famicom as Lightning Force and it's spelled Lightening.

788
01:08:17,941 --> 01:08:18,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are you going to do?

789
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:22,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you're going to bleach your hair and then color it and that's Lightning Force, I guess.

790
01:08:23,764 --> 01:08:25,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you're searching for your sister.

791
01:08:26,966 --> 01:08:27,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

792
01:08:27,206 --> 01:08:27,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

793
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:29,250
[SPEAKER_01]: No, wrong lightning.

794
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:32,152
[SPEAKER_01]: It's L-I-G-H-T-E-N-I-N-G.

795
01:08:32,172 --> 01:08:33,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to make a fantasy joke.

796
01:08:33,753 --> 01:08:33,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

797
01:08:34,814 --> 01:08:36,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

798
01:08:38,135 --> 01:08:45,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think that we have a lot to owe to with this game.

799
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:50,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, it gave us one of the best shmups ever.

800
01:08:50,883 --> 01:08:51,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Series of shmups ever.

801
01:08:52,584 --> 01:08:55,085
[SPEAKER_01]: And to think it had such a humble start.

802
01:08:56,755 --> 01:08:59,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we gotta know where our games came from.

803
01:09:02,557 --> 01:09:02,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you go.

804
01:09:03,998 --> 01:09:07,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Thunder Force, your classic game of the week.

805
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:08,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how it goes here sometimes.

806
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:14,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes the game itself isn't like, oh my god, you gotta stop everything and play this game right now and remember this.

807
01:09:14,882 --> 01:09:18,123
[SPEAKER_08]: But sometimes it's, hey, without this, we wouldn't have had this.

808
01:09:18,764 --> 01:09:21,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Or this is the thing that brought us this, you know, so...

809
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:24,006
[SPEAKER_08]: One good idea led to another.

810
01:09:24,406 --> 01:09:25,427
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go, Thunder Force.

811
01:09:25,527 --> 01:09:26,768
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great game.

812
01:09:27,068 --> 01:09:28,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the later ones are great.

813
01:09:28,429 --> 01:09:28,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not that one.

814
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,291
[SPEAKER_01]: But the music, though.

815
01:09:31,391 --> 01:09:33,833
[SPEAKER_01]: The music in Thunder Force 3 is epic.

816
01:09:34,093 --> 01:09:35,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

817
01:09:35,674 --> 01:09:39,036
[SPEAKER_08]: OrangeRite points out, even Street Fighter 2 had to start with Street Fighter 1.

818
01:09:39,597 --> 01:09:41,298
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a really good analogy there.

819
01:09:41,959 --> 01:09:43,560
[SPEAKER_01]: How hard can you hit that button?

820
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:46,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

821
01:09:46,942 --> 01:09:49,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure arcade operators loved that.

822
01:09:51,033 --> 01:09:58,721
[SPEAKER_08]: OrangeRiteChat says, we started with a Busconian-like, then a Busconian-like that swaps between that and a side-scrolling shmup, and then it's just a shmup, but a really good one.

823
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:01,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Games go on journeys sometimes.

824
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:02,025
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens.

825
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:09,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well we have a few quick stories for you, but the news is thinning, so we're going to get to our Lister Roundtable here in just a bit.

826
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:15,053
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to join us, vognetwork.com.discord, that's vognetwork.com.discord.

827
01:10:15,353 --> 01:10:19,375
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll also check our mailbag as well, participate at orangeloundtrader.com.

828
01:10:19,676 --> 01:10:21,237
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, some quick headlines.

829
01:10:21,357 --> 01:10:21,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

830
01:10:22,954 --> 01:10:31,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready at Dawn Studios, the game studio behind a lot of popular games, including The Order 1886 and Daxter.

831
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:39,742
[SPEAKER_04]: They, of course, most recently were the studio behind Echo, a VR series on the MetaQuest.

832
01:10:40,822 --> 01:10:42,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have been shut down by Meta.

833
01:10:43,224 --> 01:10:44,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Effective immediately.

834
01:10:45,385 --> 01:10:45,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

835
01:10:46,658 --> 01:10:53,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so apparently Meta's decision to close Radiate Don Cito's is almost a year and a half after purchasing them.

836
01:10:55,042 --> 01:11:05,967
[SPEAKER_04]: This is because, I guess, on their mid-July report, they had plans to cut their Reality Labs division budget by 20% by 2026.

837
01:11:07,227 --> 01:11:12,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in other words, investors need that, you know, need the line to go up, I guess.

838
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:15,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that sucks.

839
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:17,922
[SPEAKER_08]: when does it end?

840
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:19,305
[SPEAKER_08]: when does it end?

841
01:11:20,267 --> 01:11:20,688
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

842
01:11:25,896 --> 01:11:28,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched some of this on the PTB.

843
01:11:28,298 --> 01:11:29,239
[SPEAKER_01]: This was so cool.

844
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:36,163
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there are some details out for the Castlevania chapter of Dead by Daylight.

845
01:11:37,604 --> 01:11:38,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched people play it.

846
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,406
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty neat.

847
01:11:41,287 --> 01:11:48,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Your survivor is Trevor Belmont, which just strikes me as weird as having one of the Belmonts as a survivor.

848
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:56,416
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like in the little trailer video, he sees the castle and reaches for his whip only to find that it's not there.

849
01:11:59,058 --> 01:12:04,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, you are Dracula, who, I mean, this is...

850
01:12:05,709 --> 01:12:12,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a feeling it's based off of Symphony Dracula or maybe one of the re-releases.

851
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:27,696
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's something interesting that I wanted to point out because Dan and I were talking about the chase music and how we didn't really care for it at first, but that music actually comes from the first Castlevania.

852
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:32,437
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Nothing to Lose, which is one of the boss music.

853
01:12:32,757 --> 01:12:33,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't catch that.

854
01:12:33,598 --> 01:12:34,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to listen again.

855
01:12:36,926 --> 01:13:04,967
[SPEAKER_01]: if you go watch Mint Skull's video about it it's like 10 fun facts about Dracula you might not know anyway but it's some good points on there and kudos to him for doing the research on that one but it's there's rumors that actually I don't know if it's a rumor anymore that one of the skins that's going to come out for Trevor will be Alucard although honestly give me Richter

856
01:13:05,607 --> 01:13:07,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me Richter.

857
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:09,010
Give him.

858
01:13:09,771 --> 01:13:10,391
I want him.

859
01:13:11,472 --> 01:13:12,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe a Maria.

860
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:14,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, I love that.

861
01:13:14,672 --> 01:13:15,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a cypher.

862
01:13:15,573 --> 01:13:18,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta say though, Dracula looks insanely fun.

863
01:13:18,235 --> 01:13:20,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I haven't played Killer in DBD in a while.

864
01:13:20,136 --> 01:13:28,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Dracula looks insanely fun to play because I almost feel like Dracula is like a mishmash of like four other killers in the game right now.

865
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:32,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's not quite as strong as any of them, but he has like some of the best parts.

866
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Like his Hellfire is like Pyramid Head's thing.

867
01:13:34,467 --> 01:13:35,307
[SPEAKER_08]: His...

868
01:13:36,428 --> 01:13:37,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

869
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:37,550
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a...

870
01:13:48,720 --> 01:14:09,391
[SPEAKER_01]: but the the but I mean it's just great they gave all the right nods you know they they did this right from what I could tell I mean definitely there's some tweaking and balance issues um and the character designs I have to say these are some of the best we've seen um in Dead by Daylight some of the best homage I mean

871
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:11,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm into it.

872
01:14:11,511 --> 01:14:24,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, there's all the voice lines like and especially like, you know, how when you're playing Wesker and he's got, you know, when it's one of the Resident Evil people in the lobby, he has certain things for them.

873
01:14:26,016 --> 01:14:32,919
[SPEAKER_01]: That he says, yeah, Dracula has that specifically for for Belmont and special Maury dialogue.

874
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:33,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

875
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:38,522
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty epic.

876
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:45,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's two Konami games now in Dead by Daylight with Silent Hill and Castlevania.

877
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:50,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think we get Metal Gear Solid next where maybe Psycho Mantis is a killer?

878
01:14:51,621 --> 01:15:03,072
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we'll get Psycho Mantis, I think we would get Liquid Snake if anything I was just thinking that he could read your cosmetics I don't want Solid Snake in the game unless it's David Hayter

879
01:15:07,773 --> 01:15:08,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair call, fair call.

880
01:15:08,514 --> 01:15:08,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

881
01:15:10,075 --> 01:15:10,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know he'd do it.

882
01:15:11,477 --> 01:15:12,217
[SPEAKER_01]: You know he'd do it.

883
01:15:12,317 --> 01:15:12,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

884
01:15:12,718 --> 01:15:23,367
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was going to say, one other DBD tidbit that came out this last week, they confirmed on the official DBD social medias that Five Nights at Freddy's is going to be a thing next year.

885
01:15:24,388 --> 01:15:25,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I have feelings about it.

886
01:15:25,469 --> 01:15:26,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not be buying...

887
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:40,092
[SPEAKER_08]: the biggest fan wank request they've been getting on social media for a while they're finally caving in and doing it's going to be interesting if it's a cosmetic thing I'm not going to buy any of it I'm not going to support that DLC

888
01:15:42,124 --> 01:15:45,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know what happened with the creator.

889
01:15:45,225 --> 01:15:46,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard things about the creator, yeah.

890
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:49,586
[SPEAKER_08]: So I understand why people avoid it.

891
01:15:49,686 --> 01:15:57,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and I shouldn't have put any money into the Shinjeki no Kyojin Attack on Titan chapter either.

892
01:15:58,188 --> 01:16:02,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And I regret having done so just because of what an absolute garbage person the creator is.

893
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:26,955
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't write the news, I just report it So that is coming to Dead by Daylight next year Alright, and I've got one quick thing for you as well This has to do with Xbox Game Pass You know, Game Pass has had a lot of news lately And they're trying to add some more games to sweeten the deal So we do have some more games that are coming to Game Pass Including on August 7th, Creatures of Ava

894
01:16:27,776 --> 01:16:29,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Crash August 8th.

895
01:16:29,477 --> 01:16:30,637
[SPEAKER_08]: So these already happened.

896
01:16:30,737 --> 01:16:34,259
[SPEAKER_08]: The Crash Bandicoot Insane Trilogy came out on Xbox.

897
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:34,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's fun.

898
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:41,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this week, Mafia Definitive Edition is happening this coming week as well.

899
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:48,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, if you already missed it, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is also something that came out pretty recently there.

900
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:54,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, it should be also pointed out, some games are leaving on August 15th, including Airborne Kingdoms.

901
01:16:55,507 --> 01:17:01,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Offworld Trading Company, Shadow Warrior 3, and this one surprises me, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

902
01:17:02,774 --> 01:17:04,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan still plays that game a lot and loves that game.

903
01:17:04,876 --> 01:17:15,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he doesn't play it through Xbox, so it doesn't matter to him, but I know that game was getting a lot of eyes at first thanks to Game Pass, and I'm sure the deal was only for a year, because it feels like it's been about a year since Texas Chainsaw came out, but...

904
01:17:16,727 --> 01:17:18,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's a good move for that.

905
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:27,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like that game's player base is not as big as it was, and they don't exactly have the huge license pool to pull from to get a lot of new stuff in there.

906
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:32,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how did the Killer Clowns from Outer Space game do?

907
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:33,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

908
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:40,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like that game had a huge splash when it came out and it immediately fell off the radar.

909
01:17:41,193 --> 01:17:42,354
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

910
01:17:42,374 --> 01:17:46,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd have to see how that translated to sales because, again, it doesn't matter if people aren't streaming it.

911
01:17:46,937 --> 01:17:48,217
[SPEAKER_08]: It just needs to sell copies.

912
01:17:48,938 --> 01:17:50,819
[SPEAKER_08]: But I feel like it did pretty good at first.

913
01:17:51,019 --> 01:17:52,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'd have to look into that.

914
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:54,581
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

915
01:17:55,842 --> 01:18:01,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's travel around the world and see what games are coming out this week in our World Release Date segment.

916
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:02,626
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll start with the U.S., Loki.

[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, traveling to Japan to look at the releases this week.

926
01:19:56,838 --> 01:19:57,339
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing.

927
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:58,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is coming out in Japan this week.

928
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:01,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is not Golden Week.

929
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:07,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Mountain Day is tomorrow, but I wouldn't think that would affect the gaming releases.

930
01:20:07,523 --> 01:20:09,844
[SPEAKER_08]: But for whatever reason, we have no releases in Japan this week.

931
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:11,104
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's that.

932
01:20:11,304 --> 01:20:12,285

[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to move into our listener roundtable.

936
01:20:50,815 --> 01:20:53,615
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to check our emails, and we'll take any calls if anyone wants to call in.

939
01:20:59,577 --> 01:20:59,677
[SPEAKER_01]: One.

940
01:21:00,257 --> 01:21:08,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's someone who didn't either was trying to be funny or didn't get the assignment.

941
01:21:09,419 --> 01:21:09,519
[SPEAKER_01]: So

942
01:21:12,879 --> 01:21:14,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go ahead and start it.

943
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Redertainment says, Hello, peoples.

944
01:21:15,903 --> 01:21:18,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Last Sunday, you requested that viewers send in pictures of their pets.

945
01:21:18,386 --> 01:21:19,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't have any pets.

946
01:21:19,247 --> 01:21:21,149
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do have is a growing menagerie of stuffies.

947
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:24,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am going to stop right there because that is not what I asked for.

948
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:29,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I want real, breathing, alive creatures.

949
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:34,636
[SPEAKER_01]: who have personality, who can communicate with you in one way or another.

950
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:36,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love my stuffed animals too.

951
01:21:36,998 --> 01:21:38,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I have quite the collection.

952
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And yours are very cute.

953
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:47,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you have a Marie from Aristocats and a Yoshi and an octopus flipping people off with every tentacle.

954
01:21:49,088 --> 01:21:56,654
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm looking for real life cats, dogs, ferrets.

955
01:21:58,345 --> 01:21:59,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Just no mollusks.

956
01:22:00,066 --> 01:22:01,187
[SPEAKER_01]: No mollusks at all.

957
01:22:02,107 --> 01:22:05,989
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to look it up, just don't put it on there.

958
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:10,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Crustaceans also, not included, not invited.

959
01:22:11,572 --> 01:22:12,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Birds are okay, though.

960
01:22:13,253 --> 01:22:13,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Birds are okay.

961
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:15,174
[SPEAKER_01]: I want feathers, I want fur.

962
01:22:15,594 --> 01:22:17,095
[SPEAKER_01]: And scales.

963
01:22:17,355 --> 01:22:19,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I want lizards and snakes.

964
01:22:20,277 --> 01:22:26,060
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a fish, a fish is okay, as long as tank mollusks don't appear in the photo at all.

965
01:22:27,854 --> 01:22:28,555
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not funny.

966
01:22:28,635 --> 01:22:30,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like a real legit bad phobia.

967
01:22:30,358 --> 01:22:33,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but I'm just saying your laundry list is kind of amusing.

968
01:22:34,804 --> 01:22:36,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want mollusks or crustaceans.

969
01:22:36,907 --> 01:22:37,348
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy.

970
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:39,250
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

971
01:22:40,652 --> 01:22:40,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Wah.

972
01:22:41,674 --> 01:22:42,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

973
01:22:43,196 --> 01:22:44,478
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for emails then, right?

974
01:22:46,205 --> 01:22:54,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you would like to send us pretty pet pictures, as mentioned previously, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do it.

975
01:22:55,491 --> 01:22:57,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, checking in with you to see if there's any last minute stories tonight.

976
01:23:00,854 --> 01:23:05,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's been some leaks regarding what the microtransactions are going to look like for Concord.

977
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:13,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, essentially, the currency packs are going to run 500 to 12,000 coins.

978
01:23:15,425 --> 01:23:20,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they said that character skins, on the other hand, they showed off what some of those are.

979
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:22,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they look dumb.

980
01:23:23,828 --> 01:23:30,030
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't say exactly what the prices are on these.

981
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:31,811
Hmm.

982
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:35,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

983
01:23:36,173 --> 01:23:36,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

984
01:23:38,094 --> 01:23:39,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the skins look stupid.

985
01:23:41,355 --> 01:23:41,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly.

986
01:23:44,596 --> 01:23:46,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was supposed to show the prices on that stuff.

987
01:23:48,137 --> 01:23:48,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well.

988
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:51,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's wait and see.

989
01:23:51,919 --> 01:23:52,639
[SPEAKER_03]: To be determined.

990
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:55,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Please look forward to it.

991
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Or don't.

992
01:23:57,861 --> 01:23:58,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

993
01:23:59,161 --> 01:24:27,390
[SPEAKER_08]: well y'all I think that brings us to the end of a rather short show tonight but again the news is just a little bit off cycle and you know that's reflected too in even the game releases so it's a cruel summer when it comes to the news but things are going to be picking up again a little bit towards the coming weeks with Gamescom and all that good stuff so yeah look forward to that so now we're at the part of the show where we get everybody's final thoughts um fuck

994
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:29,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I've had a bad spill.

995
01:24:29,471 --> 01:24:30,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I need you guys to kill time.

996
01:24:34,493 --> 01:24:40,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I think, though, are you going to be playing anything new coming up in the next couple of weeks?

997
01:24:43,356 --> 01:24:43,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Me?

998
01:24:46,277 --> 01:24:53,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I've considered checking out Earth Defense Force 6, but probably not anytime soon.

999
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:53,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1000
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:56,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1001
01:24:56,817 --> 01:24:59,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing kind of the same stuff over and over.

1002
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:08,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to finish off Goat Simulator 3, 100%ing that because I started the DLC on that and that should be fun.

1003
01:25:09,227 --> 01:25:14,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know my other server mates have been playing Goat Simulator 3 as well.

1004
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:18,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I think probably...

1005
01:25:20,339 --> 01:25:22,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's anything coming out at the end of this year that looked good.

1006
01:25:23,281 --> 01:25:27,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny enough, actually, that game Castaway I was just talking about looks kind of cool.

1007
01:25:27,385 --> 01:25:34,150
[SPEAKER_04]: It's essentially Link's Awakening, but without Legend of Zelda thrown in there.

1008
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:40,595
[SPEAKER_04]: But as close to remaking that game in the same art style as possible.

1009
01:25:41,075 --> 01:25:42,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So that looks kind of cool.

1010
01:25:42,957 --> 01:25:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1011
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:50,138
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I think it may, it almost looks like it could be a roguelite but I don't think it is.

1012
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:52,699
[SPEAKER_04]: But they look neat.

1013
01:25:53,079 --> 01:25:53,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me check that out.

1014
01:25:54,100 --> 01:26:08,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been just trying to reconcile all the games I have on Humble Bundle and making sure that I have them in my library in Steam and I've unfortunately lost track of what I have put in there, what I have and I wish there was like a more definitive way to do that.

1015
01:26:11,324 --> 01:26:11,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1016
01:26:13,143 --> 01:26:21,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do want to give a warning out for people who are trying out the GOG Galaxy app on Mac.

1017
01:26:22,809 --> 01:26:32,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It has this weird thing where the servers will disconnect on it if you do not immediately open an executable that's the connection protocol for Terminal.

1018
01:26:34,637 --> 01:26:38,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is that now the Shortcuts app cannot run Terminal.

1019
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,563
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run shell scripts, and I'm thinking about just making a script for it and everything, but

1020
01:26:43,583 --> 01:27:09,327
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently it's been like this for years and anyone who wants to use that service and you're on a Mac definitely makes some noise so I have just removed it from my system after I redeemed some games for free and yeah, not nice but as far as games I'll be playing of course Colts of the Land, the new DLC I'm not going to have my Friday stream because it's fucking Friday we put it off for two weeks

1021
01:27:09,887 --> 01:27:14,814
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be playing Jackbox games instead and drinking heavily and dishing about ballet.

1022
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:18,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds fun.

1023
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,803
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see me play it on Wednesday, I don't know.

1024
01:27:22,263 --> 01:27:25,347
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been looking forward to this because I still love that game.

1025
01:27:25,387 --> 01:27:28,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe everyone else forgot about it, but I love it.

1026
01:27:29,528 --> 01:27:59,043
[SPEAKER_01]: and so we haven't had a return from Rob yet so we don't have controls to do anything with that so I am going to say that I have a challenge for all of our listeners right now I want you to email us and I mean this I am serious and I want each of you to tell me what game sequel that you want to see come out I'm looking for common threads

1027
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:14,817
[SPEAKER_01]: or what kind of game that you would you would want to see like what what we just need more email people give me something to do geez or else we're gonna end an hour early like we did tonight and that's not gonna be good for everybody

1028
01:28:15,549 --> 01:28:15,829
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1029
01:28:15,869 --> 01:28:16,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry about that.

1030
01:28:17,309 --> 01:28:23,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of you that were watching live probably saw that I was sipping on a very nice iced coffee that Alan went and got me during the show.

1031
01:28:23,191 --> 01:28:27,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And I spilled said coffee all over the carpeted floor and ice cubes.

1032
01:28:27,992 --> 01:28:30,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, clearly a little bit of a drinking problem.

1033
01:28:30,453 --> 01:28:32,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm more worried about putting a stain on the carpet.

1034
01:28:32,633 --> 01:28:33,774
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the part that pisses me off.

1035
01:28:35,774 --> 01:28:38,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan, I'm so sorry I ruined your life.

1036
01:28:38,655 --> 01:28:40,537
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he did not ruin my life.

1037
01:28:40,917 --> 01:28:47,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel bad because he tried to do a really nice thing by getting me coffee during this very hot part of the day and I went and spilled it all over the floor because I'm a stupid bitch.

1038
01:28:48,244 --> 01:28:49,205
[SPEAKER_08]: You are not.

1039
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:51,839
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a stupid bitch.

1040
01:28:52,019 --> 01:28:53,459
[SPEAKER_08]: E3VL does have a very good point.

1041
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:55,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Better iced than hot.

1042
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:55,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1043
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:56,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Very that.

1044
01:28:56,741 --> 01:28:57,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1045
01:28:57,501 --> 01:28:58,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, PodCulture.

1046
01:28:59,142 --> 01:29:04,364
[SPEAKER_01]: But later I will tell you the thing that I do to get cat yarf out of my carpet.

1047
01:29:06,845 --> 01:29:09,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not discoloring too bad yet.

1048
01:29:09,466 --> 01:29:11,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just hope we have some of that cleaner left.

1049
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:14,608
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some stuff to get that shit out of the carpet.

1050
01:29:14,668 --> 01:29:15,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

1051
01:29:15,128 --> 01:29:16,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it doesn't stain.

1052
01:29:16,329 --> 01:29:19,430
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, you can say it's your inaugural stain.

1053
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:19,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1054
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:20,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

1055
01:29:20,948 --> 01:29:21,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1056
01:29:41,065 --> 01:30:07,360
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah all right all right well sorry to put you all on the spot by time shit happens um thank you but we are back uh coffee happens so i was trying to wrap up the show if i could have just went like two more minutes we would have done with the show but anyway oh yeah it's a good content now and i have a challenge out to the community to send me rad um a game sequel that they want to see happen oh love it love it uh and then explain and justify why it should be the guardian legend i'm just kidding

1057
01:30:09,123 --> 01:30:11,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to justify shit about the Guardian legend.

1058
01:30:11,507 --> 01:30:12,188
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.

1059
01:30:13,189 --> 01:30:13,469
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1060
01:30:14,311 --> 01:30:21,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, with that, thank you as always in spite of user errors for listening to and downloading Orange Lounge Radio.

1061
01:30:21,641 --> 01:30:25,406
[SPEAKER_08]: If you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, thank you especially for getting this far and still saying that.

1062
01:30:27,367 --> 01:30:29,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave a nice five-star review wherever it is you found this show.

1063
01:30:30,049 --> 01:30:33,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it was Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, wherever it is you found this show.

1064
01:30:33,812 --> 01:30:35,493
[SPEAKER_08]: A nice word of mouth goes a long way as well.

1065
01:30:35,533 --> 01:30:36,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell a friend or two about the show.

1066
01:30:36,994 --> 01:30:39,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1067
01:30:39,415 --> 01:30:42,377
[SPEAKER_08]: We just need more voices to put out there on air.

1068
01:30:42,918 --> 01:30:43,278
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1069
01:30:43,418 --> 01:30:45,159
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, we're going to wrap up.

1070
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:48,862
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to say bye to DarkSakura first because she's going to do some...

1071
01:30:52,085 --> 01:30:59,567
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're going to be doing... It may be the last week of 2v8, and I will have open lobbies.

1072
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:00,827
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I'll start off with Killer.

1073
01:31:01,847 --> 01:31:03,887
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just be me and Shayla to start off with.

1074
01:31:04,648 --> 01:31:05,928
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some Killer happening.

1075
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I've decided this mode makes me a Wraith fan.

1076
01:31:10,369 --> 01:31:11,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1077
01:31:12,389 --> 01:31:15,890
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a clusterfuck the one time I tried it, so it's interesting, though.

1078
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:17,670
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to join in.

1079
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:19,391
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, everybody...

1080
01:31:21,755 --> 01:31:22,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what I said.

1081
01:31:22,815 --> 01:31:23,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Email.

1082
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:24,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me something to do.

1083
01:31:25,196 --> 01:31:25,396
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1084
01:31:25,416 --> 01:31:26,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, Jamie.

1085
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:27,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

1086
01:31:28,597 --> 01:31:29,057
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1087
01:31:29,097 --> 01:31:31,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, with that, Loki, we will turn to you and your final thought tonight.

1088
01:31:33,259 --> 01:31:35,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, we'll have a new episode out this week.

1089
01:31:35,659 --> 01:31:38,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working hard to get it done and getting there.

1090
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,181
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully, I'll be out this week.

1091
01:31:40,241 --> 01:31:43,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, check out the short if you haven't yet.

1092
01:31:43,959 --> 01:31:45,180
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1093
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,762
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought, I don't really have a big one.

1094
01:31:48,502 --> 01:31:54,807
[SPEAKER_08]: My personal streaming, once again, has just been by this wayside of other things I'm doing.

1095
01:31:54,867 --> 01:31:58,049
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's actually been really good for me being able to play games on my own schedule.

1096
01:31:58,150 --> 01:31:59,911
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is that.

1097
01:32:00,011 --> 01:32:01,832
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully I'll make some more progress in Pokemon.

1098
01:32:01,852 --> 01:32:03,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking to clear the water gym tonight.

1099
01:32:03,774 --> 01:32:04,654
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see how that goes.

1100
01:32:05,415 --> 01:32:08,397
[SPEAKER_08]: And hey, maybe I might even want to do some trades.

1101
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:10,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually I use Pokemon Home.

1102
01:32:10,959 --> 01:32:19,863
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're a Pokemon Violet owner, I have Pokemon Scarlet and maybe we need to do some trades because I do want to get some of the uniques, build up my team there, at least the ones I can get so far.

1103
01:32:20,603 --> 01:32:21,944
