10185	16687	If there was any doubt that we're in the era of subscription services, now comes Chuck E. Cheese to capitalize on the keep paying us money and forget to unsubscribe gravy train.
16907	20188	And to add insult to injury, keep paying us money and you're not allowed to stop for the first year.
20468	24509	I hope Munch's make-believe ban has been successful because legal fees are going to take a chunk out of that recurring revenue.
24829	27369	Such is the originality of private equity in a renowned franchise.
27970	29590	This is the Late Stage Capitalism intro.
29690	34751	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, James Somers, and Loki to tell me more about this and other news about games and not just child gambling.
35111	37132	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39380	46205	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46705	48727	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
48767	56433	We are live once again with episode number 1014 of our show for tonight, August 18th of 2024.
56513	59835	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always by my co-hosts.
60035	62898	First off, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
63698	63958	Hey.
64279	64939	Hi, how are you?
66360	68081	Worn the fuck out.
68201	68602	Busy day?
69693	70254	Yesterday.
70274	74757	I had a 12-hour... That's right.
74917	83565	I was out most of the day, but I saw you... I popped in and out for like two minutes because I saw that you were streaming, but unfortunately I was gone most of the day yesterday.
83645	85927	But I was like, oh, okay.
85947	88669	It was my last-minute half-assed pseudo-sub-a-thon.
89990	90451	Was it fun?
91607	101753	I had fun, but man, I didn't feel all that great because I'm on, today's my last day for my antibiotics for a bacterial sinus infection.
104375	107716	It's, yeah, it was feeling pretty rough.
107736	109858	Midna, no, you can't have my quesadilla.
109898	110158	Sorry.
111158	115761	Her highness is down there trying to get to my quesadilla.
118654	120095	It's too hot for you, baby!
121636	125359	But yeah, it was... I did make it the 12 hours out of Pure Spite.
126019	139229	And Starlock, Sia Tabiri, Star Taco were my... I have to thank all three of you for helping me pay for food at TwitchCon now.
141570	143692	So... But I...
144432	146113	I had a lot of fun.
146133	151674	I got to hang out with Ryan and Shay and Smokey and a bunch of my friends and regulars.
152334	157056	I saw you playing the, I remember now when I dropped in, you were playing the Cult of the Lamb expansion, it looked like.
157136	157716	I was.
158016	159516	Yeah, so hopefully that was fun.
159536	159997	It was so good.
160297	160737	Yeah, good.
160817	161677	It was pretty fun.
162097	162317	All right.
162817	165678	Well, let's say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
166518	166799	Hello.
167019	167399	Hi, Loki.
167419	167899	How are you doing?
168897	169177	All right.
169657	175780	So before the show started tonight, our little intro we do live for the live listeners only.
175820	180963	It's just it's just a cute little bumper inspired by you can't do that on television.
180983	182744	That'll be like such and such will not be seen tonight.
183124	194910	And tonight was conquered Cusar because the news came down the line that after 32 years, the Cusar and conquered California is closing, to which my first reaction was it was still open.
195670	197171	It didn't close during COVID.
197651	200213	I thought QZAR as a brand was like gone, gone.
200633	205816	But I thought of you, Loki, because I was like, I think you said you went there not terribly long ago.
205836	207036	Well, maybe it was a while ago.
207056	209298	It was terribly long ago at this point, yeah.
209338	211099	I guess the Vacaville, there was one in Vacaville.
211119	212880	I don't think that, the Vacaville one, I don't think is there either.
212900	217662	The Vacaville one, yeah, appears to be, they've replaced the system in it.
217802	219503	Yeah, because the bowling alley changed hands.
219823	222405	I didn't realize that until I went there for a work thing.
224573	251374	I don't know where there's still QZAR if there's one in Runner Park or not I think that might be like the last one in the area but yeah I mean that kind of happens when you're the company that makes the packs goes under several times and you know typically it doesn't people don't normally want to carry those old packs that you can't find parts for anymore and stuff like that so it's which sucks because QZAR is super fun we should make OLRs
253792	268566	I'm sure it would be a very cheap venture there was a time that I wanted to get a set of packs but I probably could do it pretty cheap nowadays if you hit it up just right but yeah it's
272100	296373	is it was it used to be unfortunately yeah I hear you I hear you all right well um yeah in chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network nine o'clock eastern six o'clock pacific at twitch.tv twitch television VOG Network VOG Network is the channel uh that you want to check out here and yeah I'm reading some comments and people are reminiscing a bit about QZAR from the bumper tonight uh Bobby Blackwolf is saying
296933	303977	who, of course, we do tape live right after Bobby Blackwolf, says there were literally three in the Atlanta area at one time and one out in Athens, my college town.
304457	306399	Dr. Sia says, I never got to go to QZAR.
306459	311321	I did visit Laser Force a couple times, even once during a lock-in where I got to try the Battletech pods.
312082	315123	S. Joe and Hunter Matt saying, apparently there is a QZAR in Long Island.
315504	319366	They've also ventured into QAX for axe throwing.
319606	319686	Ha!
320823	331170	I know that's a growing thing that you see at random places downtown, but I did not have my money on QZAR going from laser tag to throwing axes.
333272	334413	How about laser axes?
334453	335173	That would be cool.
335614	337235	You know what was going through my head right now?
337535	337755	What?
338896	340637	I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay.
340657	342899	I sleep all night and I work all day.
344102	350330	I feel like I did one of those things that like, I feel like they did like an axe throwing at like one of the Final Fantasy fan festivals.
350370	351171	I was terrible at it.
351591	352392	Terrible at it.
352452	353233	Because of course I was.
353834	354334	Of course I was.
355532	360597	Alright, well, we're going to get into, of course, video gaming news, as we do every week here on the show.
361197	362959	I'm going to talk to you a little bit later in the show.
363119	364901	I'm going to be at DragonCon in a couple weeks.
364921	367483	I want to talk all about that, but we'll get to our kickoff topic first.
368164	373188	So yeah, and as far as the conventions go, I'm going to be at DragonCon in two weeks, so I have a bit to say about that tonight.
373389	379254	DarkSakura and Loki will be at TwitchCon in about, what, five weeks or so?
379414	379714	So it's...
380495	382557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DragonCon
400195	402877	and a reminder to folks, Gamescom is this week.
402937	404117	And why is this a big deal?
404417	414742	Usually there isn't as huge of a focus on Gamescom because a lot of gaming companies used to use E3 as their time to make gaming announcements.
414822	418363	Now I'm not quite saying Gamescom is the new E3.
418483	418783	However...
420504	432511	I do feel like with the news cycle being a little bit slower, there might be more companies that have been holding on to things for Gamescom that may otherwise have usually been in that June timeframe.
432551	438774	I think case in point would be something like the Civilization VII unveil, which we talked about a couple weeks ago or last week on the show.
439134	444878	We know that Civilization VII is going to get unveiled actually in two days on Tuesday just before
445838	472647	Gamescom 4 opens up and people will get to either see it or experience the game somehow on the show floor so I'm just kind of like curious like what is you know what is the new rhythm gonna look like in this post E3 world and so it's gonna be interesting to see what Gamescom is all about now of course y'all should be like it was last year because E3 as it was last year was not a thing so
472967	482855	But a lot of these PR campaigns, they're scheduled a long ways out, and a lot of people were operating under the assumption, whether we knew it was bullshit or not, that E3 was going to come back.
482975	484436	And now it's like there is no â€“
487130	488350	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
509597	510978	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
519349	521210	What we might get out of it after all.
521650	527153	I don't think it's off the table to see things like Final Fantasy 16 PC port.
527733	532696	I mean, we know it's coming, but dated like PC port dated or maybe this Xbox thing.
532736	536518	If rumors pans out, I think there's still some little things that we could.
536638	538599	I don't know if I'd call Final Fantasy 16 a little thing.
538619	540400	I don't know if you heard this other rumor.
540460	544382	Speaking of like PlayStation games going to Xbox, there's the other way around.
544702	548324	There's this huge rumor about Forza Horizon 5 is going to show up on PlayStation 5.
549825	551026	and that's a Gamescom thing.
551506	554089	Oh no, that means literally nothing.
555791	560555	I know, Xbox's best game, best game going over to PlayStation.
562197	569044	I guess they're throwing in the towel now, it says all the conspiracy theorist people or like maybe, I don't know, they just want to sell more copies of the game.
569704	571386	Oh, that's a crazy idea there.
571646	572266	Yeah, I know.
572766	577630	Industry where they want to make as much money as possible that they're going to try to make more money.
577650	578730	Whoa.
579291	581472	That's some way out there ideas.
581832	590879	Show you this fucking series you've been missing for so long by not having an Xbox by the time Forza Horizon 6 comes out first on Game Pass before anywhere else.
591379	595121	Now you're going to be a little more likely to check out what it's all about.
595181	597103	So there's a bigger strategy behind it.
597143	598844	And yeah, the doomsdayers need to just
599684	600144	Be quiet.
601065	601525	Sit down.
603125	604166	But it's going to be interesting.
604186	607627	And I think at the end of the day, the consumer kind of wins a little bit, which I think is really exciting.
607767	609848	So anyway, not a lot else to say about that.
609888	611689	But just, you know, Gamescom is this week.
611949	616510	So we're expecting we'll get a nice intake of news in this next week or so.
616650	621152	And of course, if you do want to watch the opening night live, it is Tuesday afternoon.
621212	624053	Because again, Gamescom is based in Europe.
624393	625774	So it's going to be 2 o'clock.
626294	631717	For the East Coast, I think the East Coast is 2 o'clock, and I think for us on the West Coast, it's like 11 a.m.
632698	633898	There's no way I can watch.
633978	640162	I'm at a work event that's going to take my attention all day, so there's no way I can watch, but I'll definitely want to catch up on all the news later.
640562	643703	So, exciting stuff.
644704	648466	All right, let's move into some other news to kick off our show tonight.
648986	651628	Loki, why don't you talk about some updates going on with Steam?
652799	656543	Yep, so Steam is cracking down on a few different things.
656643	659807	So starting off with, of course, joke reviews.
659847	662970	You see a lot of these, you know, popping up with different things.
663010	667895	I think a lot of it's pretty harmless, but they want to kind of just have...
668896	671038	some of that stuff taken out of there.
671078	672319	That's ridiculous.
673680	681525	So some of the examples they show in different screenshots are full of ASCII art and stuff like that, memeing on different things.
682846	686429	Essentially, how they're identifying joke reviews.
686489	696656	They said, players may still see humorous but unhelpful reviews, but the goal is that they show up far less often when people are trying to learn about the game.
699215	704359	and says they will be using some machine learning algorithms to try to identify them.
704379	705100	Good lord.
705640	705920	Yuck.
706000	709463	You kind of have to at that point because there's so many of it.
709483	710604	It's just a numbers game.
711544	714467	I'm okay if the machine flags it for a human to review.
714827	715347	That's fine.
715367	719010	Yeah, I don't think it's necessarily that they're getting rid of those reviews.
719050	727777	I think they're just deprioritizing them so that they're further on down the review list, I guess, would be my...
729110	730311	Yes, what they're doing with that.
730571	738618	So I get the ASCII art and some of the shitposting like that, but what if I want to be very tongue-in-cheek and maybe invoke a meme or something into it?
738638	755172	Let's say, okay, I'm going to write a review for Stardew Valley, and I'm going to say, this is a game that's very chill for me to play, and when I'm playing this game, I feel very demure, very mindful, very, you know, am I going to get penalized for invoking TikTok memes?
755832	765961	No, because it's about how people respond to your review and whether they check it as a helpful or unhelpful review.
766381	768322	So it's going to be the ones that essentially are unhelpful.
768342	770845	Well, can't I just go in and mark all your reviews unhelpful?
771085	772326	Can I troll Loki by doing that?
775048	775388	Sure.
775789	777950	I don't review things so hot.
777970	778911	You got me, bitch.
779351	781533	Don't ever review stuff in text.
781653	783375	I'll review stuff on YouTube.
784421	785542	And it'll always be unhelpful.
789544	790225	Interesting.
791105	800190	Okay, I mean, this also begs the question, like, are Steam reviews... I mean, I always kind of saw Steam reviews as a bit of a cesspool anyway.
800671	806014	Like, do you all really let Steam reviews dictate if you're going to buy a game or not?
807255	807715	Not really.
807735	807995	Not really.
808260	809541	No, not really.
809641	817404	I mean, I glance over like if it's something I've never heard of to try to get an idea of like what kind of game it is.
817725	818725	But other than that.
819445	820706	Yeah, I'm with you.
820786	824128	I might use it to like gauge the temperature.
824848	826429	Okay, so some comments in chat.
826889	828790	DW Wreckage in chat says, nope, never.
829530	833232	FifthDream in chat says, I look at them to see if a game is technically broken or not.
833732	839515	I feel like so I might like kind of look, but I don't make a decision until I watch a YouTube or a Twitch stream.
840055	850841	Like if I'm on the fence about a game, I always will look for a Twitch stream of a real person playing through it and what it looks like or YouTube that's not heavily edited that shows a little bit of like raw gameplay.
851221	854083	That's where I really make my decisions, to be honest.
855204	855424	Yeah.
855604	855744	Yeah.
857544	861908	DW Records and Chat also adds, if it's mostly negative, I'll look into it more.
861968	866092	But normally, if there's a game for a good price, I get it regardless.
866552	877102	That's a very good point as well, is that even if a game is overly negative, if the game is on sale for $1.99, maybe it's a niche thing that you might like.
877242	880124	And I think we also have heard so many times...
880805	881426	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
898928	899889	Scanning the reviews.
899909	902010	I'm trying to think of things that have been review bombed recently.
902090	909256	Scanning the reviews for Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail for people posting anti-trans shit because one of the voice actresses in the game.
909476	912959	That shit should be de-emphasized, of course.
913599	917182	But that impacts a score.
917502	921265	That's why I don't pay attention to the score sometimes because games get review bombed, right?
923257	946080	so yeah all right we'll see how this plays out ultimately affects things I don't think it affects it very much but we'll see no no I don't think so um and then as far as other things they're cracking down on it's also going to be they're going to be cracking down on the actual store pages for different games and limiting what types of information can be shared um
946440	975377	mainly just three specific things so no linking to other websites they don't want you to link to like your social media pages or other things like that externally because they do have dedicated links for that type of stuff no embedding imagery that mimics Steam store UI and buttons I mean that's pretty self-explanatory and then no images links or widgets pointing to other games on Steam so you can't link to other products
979329	992846	but, um, cool I don't think it seems to, I don't think it's really going to affect much of how Steam operates other than maybe cracking down on some of this scamming stuff, especially linking out to other sites, I don't know
993530	994171	Thanks for watching!
1013152	1020478	I mean, yeah, you know, I mean, well, what if you were to say from the creators of such and such game, but you're not linking to the games in that case, I guess.
1020538	1022159	Yeah, you're not linking to them.
1022239	1029265	I think it would be like kind of having a store page and then linking out to, you know, go buy my other game.
1029325	1030066	I mean, I don't know.
1030206	1031507	I don't really know what you can.
1031567	1034930	Or this game runs best when you also own this and this.
1035190	1035270	Yeah.
1036750	1038031	I mean, yeah.
1038371	1043954	I could see maybe being able to do a bundle between multiple games.
1044014	1045394	You'll see that with different developers.
1045534	1048716	They'll have a collection of games of all their stuff that they put out.
1049076	1053498	That's kind of a way you can point to different things, but that's technically a different store
1055139	1056900	Bobby Blackwolf in chat People ruin things
1078757	1079477	Yes, that's true.
1080217	1082718	Bobby Blackwell says, go buy my other game on itch.io.
1082858	1085559	Oh yeah, that would be really bad because then you're calling out another store.
1085699	1086739	That makes a lot of sense.
1086999	1087239	Yeah.
1088240	1095221	But I mean, don't each of the manufacturers get to make their own page and link their information there or something?
1095341	1097062	Yeah, and it's so... I mean, and the Steam...
1097642	1098182	I will say, I mean...
1123507	1134494	I think that I like the combination of having the machine sift through the database and then have it inspected.
1134614	1137396	But think about how much data that is.
1137937	1138097	Yeah.
1139756	1156478	it's gonna you know I think probably one of the things is like it'll scan for links it'll scan for you know just different things on there but I don't know I feel I feel like it's a mixed bag
1156843	1163325	Yeah, and I also can see that there's a lot of just garbage on Steam that they want to sift through.
1163545	1167666	You know, a lot of the comments that people leave on Steam is that it's impossible to find shit on Steam.
1168106	1173828	Like, if you don't already know what you're looking for, if it's not on the front page of the store, it's impossible to find the stuff you want to play on Steam.
1174628	1178329	And so I can understand that they're trying to do some work to sort of combat that a little bit.
1178429	1183271	You know, it's short of reinventing the store from the ground up, but when your store is that big...
1184271	1188356	I have to be honest, I'm not sure what I would do to change Steam to make discoverability better.
1188636	1189217	I'm really not.
1190919	1192741	They really can't do a whole bunch.
1192801	1193041	Yeah.
1194402	1201690	So, it really kind of puts the onus on the publisher, or if you're self-publishing, you, to get the word of your game out there.
1202091	1202391	You know?
1202952	1203092	So...
1204284	1211949	I guess all Steam can do is try to make sure the algorithm is also pushing indie games and small games as much as it's pushing AAA games.
1212389	1218934	But I feel like through things they do like your discoverability queue, there are things they do in Steam where they kind of try to do that a little bit.
1219334	1225678	I can't sit here and just shit on what they're doing because I do think they do try in some ways, but it's just so big.
1226039	1231242	The volume of stuff on Steam is unreal.
1231282	1233964	Is there a statistic out there like how many games are on Steam?
1234865	1235825	I'm sure there is somewhere.
1235865	1246394	I just don't know where you can find it because I know the tools that we used to have to be able to check sales and stuff like that have been kind of kneecapped a bit.
1246534	1252399	So I don't know if it'll show the full list of titles that are on Steam available right now.
1252499	1258284	Okay, so I'm looking at a website called SteamDB, like Steam Database, and it does show me that in 2023...
1261906	1288773	14,452 games were released and so far in 2024 11,319 games have been released so far in 2024 with the year not over yet so I mean that may not give you a total but it still gives you a sense of the volume they're putting out over 10,000 games a year since 2021 and 2020 was damn close 2020 was 9,700 games so they've been putting out 10,000 games a year on Steam that is a lot to wrap your head around right
1289850	1290530	Yeah.
1291091	1292792	And still no decent puzzlers.
1292932	1297915	I'm kidding.
1297935	1300596	DarkSakura needs some puzzle game recommendations, it sounds like.
1301637	1302037	All right.
1302558	1308021	Well, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week, puzzle game or otherwise, in How Was Your Gaming Week?
1308361	1309522	DarkSakura, let's go to you.
1309582	1310662	How was your gaming week?
1310682	1311703	What types of games have you been playing?
1312825	1314226	Oh, it's been kind of busy.
1314466	1317768	I played a lot of Polya last night.
1319309	1321351	Probably going to play some of that tonight because I'm tired.
1322251	1327115	I've been playing the new Cult of the Lamb DLC, as you mentioned earlier.
1327135	1330377	I've been playing, of course, Dead by Daylight.
1333178	1334559	Having a decent time there.
1335220	1339923	I'm still playing the Suika game, the watermelon puzzle game.
1340629	1341690	I'm kind of addicted to that.
1341710	1347552	I've been playing Moonlight Mahjong, which isn't real mahjong, it's just like a solitaire matching game, really.
1349453	1356677	But it's been just the usual stuff, a little pinball here and there.
1357566	1362690	Yeah, and DW Wreckage, absolutely excited for the Castlevania DLC.
1363590	1364051	Me too.
1364591	1375118	And I haven't played DBD a lot in a hot minute, but I think that one might get me back, because Dracula as a killer looks badass, and I've wanted a vampire killer in that game forever, so I'm jazzed.
1376159	1379582	It's just weird having a Belmont with no whip, you know?
1379602	1380002	Yeah.
1381971	1384172	I don't know quite how I feel about that.
1384272	1389535	But otherwise, I think it's going to be something pretty awesome.
1390796	1402403	I've also been trying to think, because I finished Castlevania, well, I'll say Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight, because I was playing the Japanese version of Symphony of the Night.
1403363	1408026	and I've finished that and I'm not sure what retro game I'm going to switch on to.
1408106	1416832	I'm kind of thinking of actually looking through a list of Japanese only games and seeing what I'm going to play through.
1416952	1417332	Who knows?
1418613	1422896	Oh, and I played X-Men, the six player X-Men at work.
1425505	1426386	That's cool.
1426406	1429829	We had a little award thing and they brought out the arcade one-ups.
1434433	1442019	Drew and I actually played through and beat the game together with him on Colossus and me on Nightcrawler, of course.
1444081	1451107	And then I played Super Pac-Man and man, they need to fix the joystick on that machine.
1451307	1452628	I swear it was not
1452788	1456129	Super Pac-Man's on my little baby machine back here, and it's great.
1456289	1457369	It runs just fine.
1458129	1459230	You need control.
1459410	1462390	I mean, the game may run fine, but Joystick's broken.
1462430	1463451	It's not going to run fine.
1463471	1465851	Yeah, well, that's probably heavy usage.
1465871	1466851	That's a maintenance issue.
1466891	1468432	That's a completely different machine.
1468632	1469952	Yeah.
1470972	1474813	So there was that going on.
1474833	1475634	Yeah.
1477054	1477314	Yeah.
1478794	1489419	Oh, and a little touch of Avatar thrown in here, just offline stuff, you know, looking around, but mostly it's just been what I named.
1489860	1490080	Nice.
1491140	1491480	All right.
1492421	1494862	You didn't break the soundboard, SSJ100, Matt.
1496563	1497604	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1499106	1501807	I didn't play a whole ton of stuff other than Minecraft, really.
1502868	1508390	So I worked on publishing an episode, which I did do that about a week ago.
1509190	1511371	And I'm already working on the next one.
1512191	1517053	So I built a dropper ride in my theme park.
1517373	1518614	I saw that.
1518694	1519114	That was cool.
1519864	1531801	Yeah, yeah, and then I've got a wild mouse that's being built in this episode, so that'll be coming soon.
1531841	1534545	And I guess I could mention it because it's not really...
1536274	1537515	Word of our show rolling, I think.
1537855	1547979	So they had like a Nest Maker Direct yesterday talking about like some of the updates with the software and stuff, which, you know, I use that to make Pixel Poops number two.
1548340	1551281	So there's some exciting stuff coming down the road.
1552541	1561686	It's not available right now, but they're going to... They have been talking about publishing through their site that they have called the Retroverse that...
1563146	1584831	they'll be doing physical versions of the games at some point where you can publish through them and they basically give you a cut anytime it sells but they handle all the other stuff with that so that's certainly an option that I want to go down when that's available because that would make it a lot easier than having to constantly make my own
1585926	1602820	Game Cartridges and stuff like that but the other thing that's cool too they have this publishing arm that they're working with called Bitmax Games that's publishing Nesmaker games on the Switch, Xbox Steam, iOS, Android uh
1604145	1630586	I don't know if it was like PC, Mac, and Linux and stuff like that but anyways I'm interested in that as well so like when that comes around same type of thing they'll essentially publish your game and then give you a cut like a small cut of the sales when it gets sold so hopefully that happens sooner than later right now they also announced though too that they're kind of spinning off Nest Maker into this new thing called Retro Game Forge which is
1631206	1631426	DarkSakura,
1654190	1655092	Yeah, I think that'll be fun.
1655452	1661862	Hopefully that comes down the line and we can get that out on the Switch just so more people can play it.
1662236	1662816	That's funny.
1662856	1663576	Yeah, I know.
1663636	1664257	I think that's great.
1664437	1672119	Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out, I think having your game stand on its own on these storefronts instead of being hidden behind DLC of a free game will help with discoverability.
1672139	1673279	Well, don't forget HIO, Bobby.
1674179	1675380	I don't think that's the case on HIO.
1675400	1677520	But yes, I mean, the more the merrier, right?
1677560	1680421	Especially when, like, at this point, you've kind of written off the game.
1680481	1681802	It's like, okay, it was a labor of love.
1681822	1682482	I learned a lot.
1682522	1684322	I'm not going to retire to a mansion with it.
1684722	1688924	Like, throwing it at additional storefronts and seeing what happens, why not, right?
1689144	1689364	So...
1691104	1699270	Have you ever, Loki, have you ever thought, like I know a lot of your spare time is the Minecraft content creation and everything you do in that community.
1699650	1703033	Have you ever thought about getting back on the horse and doing another NES game?
1703837	1706978	I just don't have time to do it with the Minecraft stuff.
1707058	1710439	Try to do something maybe that isn't a toilet joke.
1710479	1718282	As much as we all enjoyed that, maybe if you did something that was different, you might... Oh, you never know.
1719242	1723923	I think maybe I have to see what the Super Nintendo stuff looks like.
1724003	1724664	At one time, I...
1726758	1752686	something with the Playdate and the GB Studio stuff that they have that piece of software is pretty good so you could do like Game Boy games out of that pretty easy so I might look into that as well I don't know but it takes a lot of time it's not going to be something that I'm probably going to be doing within the next couple years though unfortunately because it's just don't have the time to split like that
1753730	1770150	uh DJ Ranma S with a throwback in chat says we need another Loki remix okay so I'm sure I know newer listeners of OLR would not know this this goes way back but before Loki was doing the Minecraft before he was doing he was doing like I don't know if you call them mashups remixes yeah mashups
1770470	1796768	So, okay, you know what I think of when I go to TikTok and I hear the cupcake remix of a certain song where, you know, it's all these nasty words, you know, to, you know, like, you know, instead of H-O-T-T-O to go, it's like, wash my ass and tits to go, you know, like, it's like, Loki would do that with like, well, not that foul, but like would take songs and kind of mash them together and do these, like, and you had some really good stuff.
1797148	1799750	Like, honestly, to be honest, I still remember like,
1800550	1822820	you did a song from In The Groove and mashed it up with Verbalicious Don't Play Nice and it sounded so good you took a song from The Matrix and mashed it up with god damn I can't remember it was the Highway song from The Matrix and you just and it was so good like yeah Loki did some really sweet remixes back in the day I wonder do you have an mp3 do you have a library of all those somewhere
1823615	1825215	Yeah, I have them all still.
1825796	1827036	I want to send them over.
1827096	1837599	We need to put them somewhere on a Dropbox or something so we can, yeah, have those preserved, even though, sure, they're questionable, you know, legalities.
1837959	1839199	The stuff on TikTok's worse.
1839319	1840460	The stuff on TikTok's way worse.
1840760	1841900	Yeah, I mean, for sure.
1841960	1846121	And then, like, some of that stuff, like, I listen back to it and I'm like, oh, that was just lame.
1846201	1847842	I just put Gravity on top of that song.
1847942	1849682	You know what?
1849822	1851443	It didn't really make anything, you know.
1852203	1852343	Um,
1853587	1857969	Oh, there's some, yeah, the, the, the, oh God, what was the verbalicious one?
1858029	1865251	So it was Don't Play Nice and, um... It was, was the song called Zodiac or was the artist Zodiac?
1865471	1866912	No, Zodiac was the song.
1866952	1867212	Okay.
1867252	1867392	Yeah.
1868154	1893303	that's it it was a really good remix all right we'll have to we're gonna dig them up someday and we'll play them on the air all right uh well i i say that but then i'm like oh but then twitch has all these excuse me twitch has all these weird rules around the dj stuff now so now they're gonna be so maybe we have to play it private on discord or something because it might get weird if we try to do it here on twitch yeah i have them all here in the folder really um can you drop boxes on me
1894532	1913284	uh yeah probably yes all right cool okay um all right my gaming week uh a lot of Final Fantasy 14 of course y'all know me at this point of course playing a lot of the mobile games I've actually been playing a lot more Monster Hunter now lately randomly uh trying to get my steps in in Pikmin I planted an impressive amount of flowers this week
1914184	1914964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1938777	1947663	and then there's one other game I've been playing and I kind of am like should I talk about this or not because technically here's the thing you're not supposed to talk about this game
1948373	1973244	but what's happening with this game is it's becoming like okay like you know the first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club okay 33,000 people are concurrently playing Fight Club it has hit the gaming news everybody knows about this fucking game it's just that they're trying to create this scarcity thing going on right now which was always very successful for Google products like Gmail
1973644	1974165	Google Wave.
1974325	1975686	Hey, get me an invite to Google Wave.
1975766	1976847	I want to get on Google Wave.
1977128	1978229	The fuck is Google Wave?
1978569	1980991	I don't know, but I want to be in it because it's invite only.
1981512	1983914	So they're creating that whole scarcity thing with...
1985057	1989838	Valve's worst kept secret of all time, Deadlock is the other game I played this week.
1991699	1999901	And technically, as somebody pointed out, you can hit escape and never agree to the thing where it says don't talk about this game or whatever it is.
2001221	2003041	And look, I'm not going to go in depth.
2003141	2004822	There's way worse shit on YouTube.
2004902	2006442	I'm just going to say, yeah, I've played it.
2007102	2009723	And it's very easy to invite people to it.
2009863	2012784	If you know anybody on Steam that has it, they can invite you to it.
2013184	2014324	And I would assume...
2014944	2019426	Gamescom is when Valve is finally going to announce that this is legit and like what's going on with this.
2019826	2020286	But we'll see.
2020326	2020646	We'll see.
2022047	2022907	But it is.
2023047	2024268	So what is Deadlock?
2024588	2026808	It is Overwatch, basically.
2026868	2030350	So like the heroes and that concept meets a MOBA.
2031345	2031745	That's it.
2031906	2032546	That's what it is.
2032726	2034929	And I know that sounds incredibly uninteresting.
2035910	2037411	Actually, that's opinion.
2037831	2041475	And I actually was really into it, what I've played of it.
2042036	2049703	But yeah, if you don't like first-person shooters, or even it's technically not first-person because it's over the shoulder, but if you don't like those types of shooters, no, you're not going to like this.
2050504	2054468	If you don't like MOBAs, eh, you might not, though.
2055249	2055429	Yeah.
2055609	2056190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2074611	2074711	Dota 2
2090507	2115538	and some of the characters are pretty fun I like the and I don't know their names sorry but there's a guy with a bunch of electricity shit and that's the guy like he throws these electricity grenades and can like tie two to two people together with electricity so they keep shocking each other like I I like that guy I also think it was very smart it's a very subtle but cool aesthetic to build in that to get quickly down the lanes you have zip lines and
2115658	2121186	So what you do is if you're at the base and you want to go down a lane, you hook to a zip line and you go, woo, flying down a lane.
2121246	2126213	It's a very simple thing, but creates a really cool aesthetic and an over-the-shoulder first-person shooter.
2126574	2130219	That's like, was it straight out of Bioshock Infinite?
2130339	2130960	Yeah, kind of.
2131301	2131561	But that's...
2132626	2133407	and DarkSakura.com.
2148624	2149545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2178965	2180546	is it an Overwatch killer?
2181507	2204161	no, because it's a different game it's still a MOBA at heart a traditional MOBA at heart and some people are going to be into that, some people aren't and that's really that but yeah, I'm enjoying Deadlock so far and I look forward to when more of my friends are finally on it because I sent some invites out but it can take up to a day for those people to get their invitation and a lot of people don't realize you have to check your email
2204941	2213349	So if you think somebody invited you to Deadlock, check your email because you have to acknowledge it in the email before you can actually launch it in the store.
2214951	2216172	But that's all I have to say about that.
2216472	2222978	Hopefully Valve officially announces the game this week because it's ludicrous.
2223018	2226581	This whole test they're doing is silly at this point.
2226642	2226942	Come on.
2228851	2231194	DragonCon is coming up in less than two weeks!
2248062	2256974	DragonCon starts on a Thursday because yes, DragonCon is so fucking stacked over Labor Day weekend on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and most of Monday.
2257875	2263922	People are usually leaving and heading out of town, but they do have content on Monday that now DragonCon backs up into Thursday.
2264523	2268905	and like this is, I've seen more content this year on Thursday night than any other year prior.
2269246	2271967	Thursday night was usually like Dragon Con wrestling.
2272287	2274148	Yes, they have a whole little wrestling thing they do.
2274448	2275269	But that was usually it.
2275489	2277630	It was like, that's all they have is wrestling on Thursday night.
2277990	2281552	Nope, they've got panels, content, the works.
2281672	2285114	The only thing is like the Hall of Fame and the vendor halls are not open on Thursday.
2285154	2286815	But otherwise, a lot of the experiences there.
2287455	2288416	I know, oh my gosh.
2288876	2289356	Wild, wild.
2289756	2292398	Anyway, I will be going to Dragon Con for the...
2293948	2295448	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2317242	2326233	until now because the app came out this week and if you actually go into the DragonCon app you can actually find me
2327287	2327627	DragonCon.com
2349753	2353375	Thursday night, I will be doing a digital media kickoff.
2353536	2356778	The VOG Network presents a digital media connection event.
2357078	2366604	So this is a big networking event and it's kind of like the, there's a formal panel to kick off the digital media track because Bobby's going to be on that.
2366885	2374249	But then right after is more of a informal meet and greet, come hang out, meet other content creators, exchange information, ideas.
2374990	2378412	I'm going to rely on a little bit of what I do with my day job to
2380513	2381834	I think it'll be a fun panel.
2396488	2403352	So then I have a panel that's not on my schedule on Friday, but I'm going to be doing a panel.
2403372	2407074	And I'm sorry, because since I don't have it officially on my schedule, I forget the time.
2407174	2408675	I think it's at 2.30.
2410536	2418361	But I have a panel on streaming retro games that I'm going to be just a panelist on unofficially because they added me at the last minute.
2419021	2419562	But I'm excited.
2419602	2420322	I love retro games.
2420362	2421183	Excited to talk about that.
2421903	2426686	So let's talk about my first main track panel, which is going to be on Saturday, August 31st.
2427286	2431008	I will be moderating a panel with the voice actors from Baldur's Gate 3.
2432869	2443355	And that includes, from Baldur's Gate 3, we're going to have Alena Baranova, Jennifer English, Neil Newborn, Theo Solomon, and Devorah Wilde.
2444056	2445457	I'm incredibly angry right now.
2446657	2447558	Why are you angry?
2449090	2451571	because you can't be happy for your friend.
2451591	2454013	I'm happy for you and angry for me.
2454073	2455393	You're angry for you because you're not going.
2457955	2458715	Money exists.
2458855	2459376	No, I know.
2459436	2459716	I know.
2459876	2460076	I know.
2462051	2463932	I'm very, very excited about that.
2464293	2470858	And I've played a little bit of Baldur's Gate 3, but I think you all know I did not have the best Twitch experience with that game.
2471338	2476202	But I'm doing some cramming behind the scenes to make sure I'm ready for that.
2476242	2478103	That is still going to be a fan Q&A.
2478504	2482907	So to be honest, you don't have to know a lot about a property to do a fan Q&A.
2483227	2484408	So that is...
2485669	2487350	Yeah, that is going to be a thing.
2487370	2488451	And I'm really excited to do it.
2488491	2489671	That's going to be huge.
2490171	2490932	So yeah.
2491272	2491452	Yeah.
2491512	2495434	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I also asked for Baldur's Gate 3, but Rob got it.
2495514	2497035	So, you know, yeah, it is what it is.
2497595	2502258	But the funny and ironic thing is, do you know what video game panel Bobby got instead?
2503359	2504039	Mass Effect.
2504139	2505920	He got the voice actors from Mass Effect.
2505980	2507701	So that did kind of make me laugh.
2508942	2509242	Yeah.
2509702	2509963	All right.
2510243	2510463	Yeah.
2510523	2511343	I am again angry.
2511783	2512804	I agree with Quest Buster.
2512884	2514825	The voice actor work throughout the game is amazing.
2514945	2516105	Easily one of its strongest points.
2516226	2516706	Absolutely.
2517066	2517266	Okay.
2517306	2520327	Let me mention some non-video game, but still really cool things I'm doing.
2521048	2527671	On Saturday at 5.30 PM, I have the pleasure of doing a panel with guests from the Star Wars universe.
2528251	2535595	So these are mostly Disney Plus shows, but Natasha Lou Bordizzo from Ahsoka is going to be there.
2536155	2540683	Giancarlo Esposito, who is also in The Boys, and Mandalorian.
2540903	2542866	He's my favorite bad guy ever.
2543007	2544329	Yep, is going to be there.
2544950	2546232	And Danny Trejo.
2547694	2548476	Awesome.
2548937	2548957	I...
2550143	2552545	about Lost My Damn Mind when I saw that one.
2552585	2554746	So this is going to be a very fun panel.
2555767	2568836	And then the panel that I requested and I actually got, I'm very excited about this on Sunday, Star Trek Lower Decks, Tawny Newsome and Eugene Cordero, two of the voice actors from Star Trek's Lower Decks are going to be there.
2569616	2571177	I actually got to work with them a little bit.
2571297	2571898	Well, not work with them.
2571918	2576721	I got to meet them and talk to them on the Star Trek cruise and they were an absolute delight.
2576781	2578502	So I'm really excited about that one.
2580463	2609200	some more games or excuse me some more panels on the digital media track streaming beyond video games that's going to be pretty interesting because we're going to talk about things that you can stream on Twitch that aren't just video games such as a podcast or hot tub stream sure I don't know if we have any hot tub streamers on the portal on the portal the panel but yes and then turning digital media skills into IRL skills that's going to be really cool because we're talking about how
2610040	2610921	and DarkSakura.
2630791	2632673	Zach Aguilar, Jason Librecht, and Abby Trott
2655054	2659736	and Fire Emblem Three Houses and also as the characters in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
2660037	2671943	And then this is really cool because I didn't know this person went to conventions, but Abby Trott is also the singer of the English version of the theme for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
2672603	2696449	that's kind of fun and she's Annette in Fire Emblem she has Ivy and Carmen Sandiego on Netflix and Windblade in the Transformers Prime Wars trilogy so yeah lots of lots of awesome resumes there so yeah that'll be a fun panel you got my attention there because that's like one of my favorites of the newer Transformers characters yeah yeah so um yeah so DragonCon this year
2698413	2701956	I've kind of been hinting at this for a while is that I expect this is going to be a big year and a fun year.
2701996	2706060	And wow, I'm very humbled and grateful for this opportunity to do this.
2708723	2713508	I just want to have a good time and make sure these panels are a good time and host them for folks.
2713728	2715830	So yeah, I hope to see you all at DragonCon.
2716291	2718713	Obviously, again, the best time to meet me
2719494	2722015	Bobby Blackwolf Introduce Catherine Tate
2747221	2749162	who's of course Donna Noble, one of the companions.
2749562	2752944	So that's... I'm sorry, even better than that, she's Lauren.
2753745	2756526	Yeah, she actually, she has a very impressive, she was in the office and all that, yeah.
2756906	2759127	So she has an impressive resume, but yes.
2760088	2760688	That's, yeah.
2761148	2762969	Yeah, SSJ100 Matt does bring up a good point.
2763089	2765410	I hope the SAG-AFTRA stuff gets resolved soon.
2765430	2772494	That's a very good point because I don't know to what extent I'll be able to, I probably won't be able to talk about Fire Emblem, which is fine because it's an anime panel anyway.
2773254	2773955	The Baldur's Gate 3...
2775555	2780637	I would think Larian is not on a struck list, but I don't know that for sure.
2781037	2783078	So I probably will not know until I get there.
2783178	2783839	But you know what?
2784739	2796764	Even if we had to talk about other things, I am sure there are plenty of you out there that would listen to Neil Newborn and all of those voice actors I mentioned read the fucking phone book.
2796784	2797024	Yeah.
2797584	2823213	so we will find plenty to talk about don't worry Baldur's Gate 3 or otherwise yeah he's fun to watch stream too yeah yeah like he will just bust out into a starry end at a drop of a hat yeah so yeah there was the uh Giancarlo uh Esposito uh the one thing I think of about you know that would be definitely not struck work is when he cameoed on Dropout as part of um
2823868	2826152	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2838069	2841710	It was awesome.
2841730	2851613	I personally would want to know a bit more about mocap work because that's actually a big thing that Neil Newbon does.
2851973	2859795	He's got mocap education, resources for voice actors, ways to help professionals in the field.
2859835	2866717	He really has done a lot of good work for other actors who happen to be in a virtual field.
2867028	2874490	You know, you bring up a really good point because a lot of things we call voice actors in gaming today actually has a lot of mocap stuff going on.
2874550	2879671	And the best example of that I can think of is actually a panel I was lucky enough to do a couple years ago at DragonCon.
2880312	2883232	I did a panel with actors from Red Dead Redemption and the sequel.
2883812	2887093	And it was funny because in the book, it was called voice actor panel.
2887173	2889214	But when we got there and got up on stage, they were like,
2889794	2896659	Actually, we're like acting in like a small theater in these mocap things, basically in a room that's like a theater.
2896939	2901402	And so actually, I learned a lot about that process from the Red Dead folks.
2901602	2903063	That was really enlightening to me.
2903864	2911529	And I want to say one of them did like a Let's Play of the series with somebody else on YouTube and talks a lot about that.
2911949	2912790	So, oh, thank you.
2912810	2916693	Bobby Blackwell says performance actors is what they prefer to be called in that case.
2917173	2928427	Yeah, and I really appreciate, because he also, I mean, he did, great, I can't remember the character, it's in one of the Resident Evils I didn't play, Resident Evil 4.
2930850	2934455	And then he was in Detroit Become Human.
2934475	2934795	Mm-hmm.
2935596	2943522	as Gavin and then as the CEO guy, which honestly, I always thought there was something a little bit off about the accent.
2943562	2945964	He does a really decent American accent.
2946564	2955691	But I mean, I've followed his career, you know, in voice acting and mocap for a hot minute.
2955911	2956011	And
2957951	2965479	Honestly, I have to say is one of my inspirations for getting into some of the projects that I'm doing.
2965859	2966360	That's awesome.
2966540	2967761	That I can't talk about yet.
2969383	2969703	Alright.
2969823	2972046	Because I still am in the planning stages.
2972873	2973874	Welcome to DragonCon!
3001357	3003599	No show on September the 1st for that reason.
3003840	3007703	Another chance for me to take over.
3008124	3008424	Awesome.
3009325	3010506	I have my wild way.
3011026	3015691	Bobby Blackwell points out we do the annual masquerade party in the VOG Network suite.
3015771	3018794	And I will give a shout out to this.
3019134	3023479	Technically, I don't know what is and isn't broadcast, but...
3025020	3027661	DragonCon TV is a really cool thing.
3027781	3032102	If you can't go to DragonCon, you can still get like a $10 membership for DragonCon TV.
3032462	3035323	And you can see a selection of a lot of these different types of panels.
3035823	3039644	And DragonCon TV is something they actually beam into the hotels.
3039664	3042325	So they use the in-house hotel channels.
3042425	3046626	So if you're at a host hotel, one of the five host hotels, you can actually watch DragonCon TV.
3046966	3052668	So if you are too tired and you want to lie in bed, but you want to see one of the big panels, you can actually watch DragonCon TV.
3052828	3075013	A lot of them are streamed on DragonConTV I don't know if any of mine are I imagine the Baldur's Gate Well, I think they're doing the Baldur's Gate one three times But I imagine one of these might be on DragonConTV So you can actually see that If you can get me the time for that, I'll actually I'll take off work if I have to Oh, I love that, thank you so much And I hope that no one from work is listening to me say that
3076486	3077466	I will try to find out about that.
3077506	3082867	But yes, DragonCon TV memberships are a way that you could do that and participate virtually, which will be cool.
3082907	3102392	But something that Bobby and I do every year is that Sunday night, we will get a group of friends together from DragonCon and have a masquerade party where we watch the masquerade from the comfort of our hotel room eating pizza and just being able to talk relatively as loud as we want amongst friends and watching the masquerade.
3102452	3104132	And there are certain traditions where
3104432	3105792	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3131820	3139025	The year they did it virtually, they didn't get the streaming rights to be able to stream that cartoon for obvious reasons.
3139605	3146230	So they remade the cartoon with all these people that are at DragonCon all the time.
3146310	3148151	I'm confident Mark Muir's got to be in there.
3148171	3155656	I'm confident Mark Muir and Garrett Wong are almost certainly in this, where they actually just reenacted Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a half century.
3156777	3158258	It was fucking great.
3158318	3159278	No, it wasn't animated.
3159759	3161300	It was people wearing costumes.
3162761	3163321	It was great.
3163701	3167204	Actually, the virtual year was really sweet.
3167244	3175170	That whole situation was shit, but DragonCon did an amazing job for 2020 because the parade was awesome too.
3175190	3186638	The way they did the parade, they still had people, they recorded people, and they had them walk left to right across the street so that the parade looked like it was always people going by.
3186898	3187119	It was...
3189003	3190724	They did the best they could with that whole thing.
3191404	3193265	Oh, Bobby Blackwolf actually links it in chat.
3193285	3200228	I'm not going to play it now, but check that out if you're in the chat room or you can search it later for the Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a half century.
3200348	3202750	Okay, let's get into video game news, though.
3202770	3204350	You're not here for Daffy Duck, unfortunately.
3204630	3205791	You're here for video game news.
3205971	3207592	So let's get to it, Loki.
3209164	3212947	Alright, some more rumors on when that Switch 2 is expected.
3214989	3219872	We kind of figured probably the end of this quarter, or financial year I should say.
3220473	3222895	So, March 2025.
3223355	3230661	However, apparently some developers are expressing that they expect it to be launching next financial year.
3231954	3237357	So sometime between, you know, after March 2025.
3237738	3239959	So maybe early April, maybe May.
3241400	3241800	Who knows?
3241900	3244642	Nintendo plays by their own set of rules.
3245583	3248665	Also, apparently this has been confirmed as well by UniruGamer.
3248825	3256430	They said they can corroborate this as well with April 2025 being the very earliest the console could arrive now.
3258134	3261658	So we'll just wait and see until they announce it officially.
3261858	3265302	Let's just keep fucking waiting for that Nintendo successor because I...
3267327	3276293	Look, I'm on the fence here because I'm like, if they are delaying it to make sure they have enough parts to make enough of them to meet the demand, it's hard for me to be upset.
3276453	3283398	I want to make sure it is not a pain in the fucking ass to get one of these when they come out, like most Nintendo hardware usually is when it comes out.
3283758	3290423	I do not have to want to sit there humping the Target app, refreshing inventory at my local stores to get a fucking Switch 2.
3290823	3291904	I want to be able to just...
3292324	3292784	Get one.
3293144	3295406	Like, order it on Amazon, have it show up at my house.
3295506	3298807	Or pre-order it at Best Buy, go walk to the store and get it.
3299067	3302309	Like, it should be that easy, I hope.
3302769	3304590	So if that's the reason for the delay, fine.
3304970	3313135	But otherwise, it's like, the Switch is not getting any younger, and it is getting harder and harder to tolerate games on it, let me tell you.
3314155	3315556	It's falling behind big time.
3316454	3317315	Yeah, for sure.
3317855	3325699	And I'm just wondering what we'll see as far as announcements for more games because it's kind of not really anything else coming out.
3326060	3333644	I wouldn't be surprised if they just try to push it into that maybe for whatever reason they're going to hit their target numbers in this financial year.
3333664	3337306	So they're like, okay, we'll just pad out the next one or something like that.
3338927	3341729	I don't know what the reasoning for it would be, but...
3344099	3345000	I don't know, it doesn't matter.
3345820	3352505	Unless it's delayed to 2026 or something like that, which I don't think it would be.
3352805	3353746	It really doesn't matter.
3357764	3360205	I feel like it's either coming end of May or in June.
3360605	3367369	July seems late, but then again, I'm all for Nintendo waiting as long as possible and making sure enough units are made so the scalpers can't get them.
3367869	3378875	At this point, considering all this information we have about when it is coming and when it isn't coming, I think that Memorial Day weekend, which you're kind of highlighting there, May or June, I think that Memorial Day weekend sort of period is a good bet.
3379375	3379655	We'll see.
3379755	3380416	We'll see.
3408508	3412652	Quest Buster in chat says, Tears of the Kingdom really laid bare how far it pushed the Switch.
3412953	3413753	Yeah, absolutely.
3414534	3420300	I've been playing Pokemon Scarlet recently and I know tons of you have played it as well and you know, it's rough.
3421621	3427927	So it really feels like you're playing the low-end specs version of a Switch that never was, but we'll see.
3427947	3432632	Let's just hope that the new one, though, has the specs to keep up with this stuff because if it's just like...
3433666	3455112	well it doesn't run as bad you know then that could be I would think that the dev kits would match that and so hopefully a lot of that will get worked out I mean you know the Pokemon company doesn't always make the best optimized games but like I have got to have a new switch for Pokemon Legends ZA I've got to have a new switch for Pokemon Legends ZA by the way
3456520	3456901	The PokeMedia
3473500	3476803	While we await... Oh, closing ceremonies are in an hour or so.
3476823	3479625	All right, well, we might still be live when that all happens, so we'll see.
3480145	3482487	Otherwise, it'll be right after we go off air tonight.
3483107	3487491	Well, let's follow back on something we were talking about last week.
3487571	3498158	So we had some late-breaking news during the show last week that Tango Gameworks was being absorbed by a new publisher, Krafton, who, of course, made...
3498959	3500520	PUBG, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.
3501400	3505482	And that was happy news because we didn't want to see Tango go away.
3505542	3507343	We didn't want to see Hi-Fi Rush go away.
3507703	3509024	And so this is very happy news.
3509084	3511565	But it also begged the question, well, wait a minute.
3512754	3514116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3530396	3530936	Thank you for watching.
3530956	3531556	See you next time.
3558433	3572041	So folks are thinking this is probably the half that didn't yet find new employment or just pieced out of the industry or for whatever reason otherwise decided they were not going to continue the journey.
3572561	3574582	So it seems like we have some clarity now.
3574603	3578565	It's about half of who was working at Tango before is going to carry on with this.
3578925	3606064	but that could still be an interesting kind of mix of like the people that made the game before and knew what made it great and maybe some new folks that come in from Krafton's side that helped to innovate with some new ideas that could be very interesting I mean obviously it would have been better if we didn't have the layoffs in the first place but I'm trying to find the silver lining in this you know maybe kind of mixing together a little bit there will cause some cool new ideas for Hi-Fi Rush 2 which seems at this point inevitable we will get that game it's just a matter of when
3606764	3608405	So that was an interesting follow-up.
3608445	3610367	We got a little question answered that we had last week.
3611628	3614590	Unfortunately, DarkSakura has some news on the flip side of the coin, right?
3615191	3620435	Well, I was also just reading back to Krafton that they got this big funding deal too.
3621776	3625119	So they're actually looking to be in really good shape.
3625419	3627020	Yeah, no, it's good for them.
3627120	3634166	And yeah, obviously very, very happy with this ending, even if it would have been nicer to be a little sooner before Microsoft did what they did, but.
3635037	3638079	But in that not-so-good news, this is about Ubisoft.
3638899	3650426	They are doing another round of layoffs in San Francisco and Cary Studios that was also better known as Red Storm Entertainment.
3651187	3653348	And this is the second round of layoffs.
3654268	3661333	Playing off 45 people between those two groups.
3661353	3662633	This actually happened on the 16th.
3664194	3666855	There's not a big breakdown out as far as I can tell.
3667655	3676619	But I mean, they were dealing with canceled games with Red Storm, like Division Heartland.
3678359	3680900	They'd also worked on Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six.
3681540	3683801	So we'll see what happens.
3685021	3691664	But that's 45 more people who have to look for jobs in an already diminishing...
3693160	3693500	Field.
3694341	3697885	Meanwhile, Yves Guimond, CEO of Ubisoft, still has a job.
3698166	3701850	And all of us are sitting here and hearing this news wondering why.
3708542	3709543	That's all I have to say as well.
3709603	3710723	I was actually kind of curious.
3710763	3712384	I was like, hmm, let's see.
3712544	3718827	I'm looking at a story from, let's see, what is this here we're looking at?
3718887	3724510	Oh, this was published last month in an article on Gamefile.
3724830	3727832	I think this might be a, is this the actual site?
3729565	3729805	I don't know.
3729825	3734729	I'm looking at a site called Gamefile.news, but I think it might be one of those third-party things that's pushing another article.
3734789	3736990	But it was from a Google search, so I just took what came up.
3737631	3748058	But it actually mentions that the pay for the past year ended up being $2 million in cash and stock for Yves Guimond.
3749139	3749459	$2 million.
3750900	3756925	That's actually not as much as I thought it would be, but that's still way too much money for somebody who's hemorrhaging employees like that.
3758584	3766613	Yeah, I mean, first of all, no one needs that kind of income, maybe unless they live in a very expensive city, maybe.
3767754	3769516	But that's a whole other, you know,
3773342	3794298	the big thing is that if your company is failing the primary responsibility is going to fall on the person that runs the company being the CEO and if the CEO is unwilling to make sacrifices then the board needs to step in and do something
3795040	3807454	Now I will point out before it's pointed out to me in chat or email that Ysgaon did take a 30% pay cut a couple of years ago, but I think we can all agree, Satoru Iwata, you are not, sir.
3809236	3809496	Alright.
3810057	3811399	Well, no one is Iwata.
3811679	3811819	No.
3812520	3812860	No, no, no.
3813401	3814042	Alright, moving on.
3814082	3814302	Loki.
3815475	3842770	yeah so I guess this is not super surprising but there was a highly anticipated Modern Warfare 2 remaster multiplayer mod because when that game was released they didn't include the multiplayer portion of it and this would have modified Modern Warfare 1 to basically have some of the maps from Modern Warfare 2 or like remaster those
3845011	3863380	and as you would expect cease and desist of course someone did their job for them one day before it was supposed to be released so what happens well that's too bad hope it doesn't leak on the internet that would be tragic if it did
3865603	3891133	and then in somewhat better news Call of Duty is Activision is changing how Call of Duty is going to be available to download because one of the things that kind of is associated with Call of Duty recently over the last few years is it's enormously stupidly large download size right now the current size of the game is 175 gigabytes which is
3893860	3894321	Huge.
3895162	3901830	But now they're going to allow you to essentially split up that download to the parts that you would play.
3901930	3912083	So for example, the single player campaign, if you're just going to be playing the online Warzone stuff, multiplayer, whatever the case may be.
3913476	3922124	They're going to have a launcher that will allow you to access the different modes and then delete the rest later on if you need to.
3922965	3928129	So that's the bare minimum they could have done, at least.
3929911	3930792	Cool, thanks.
3931572	3939720	I feel like it's that scene from Sailor Moon where Tuxedo Common says, my job is done, and she's like, but you didn't do anything.
3939740	3939820	Yeah.
3942273	3943074	Didn't he, Lisa?
3943314	3943775	Didn't he?
3944755	3949840	S2100Matt says, Oh, so you can only use up to half your data cap and not all of it downloading the whole game.
3949900	3950581	Yeah, exactly.
3950681	3951102	That part.
3951742	3955206	It's dumb.
3956987	3957388	I don't know.
3957628	3963474	I mean, I haven't been engaged in Modern Warfare or that type of stuff in a while, so...
3965458	3967059	DarkSakura's Undivided Attention Dragon Age Yeah
3993184	3993925	I'd say it worked.
3994025	3994326	All right.
3994806	4005018	Let's talk about specifically Dragon Age Veilguard, which is, of course, the latest entry in Dragon Age that we have been waiting a long, long, long time for.
4005518	4008722	A Steam pre-order is already published, by the way.
4009255	4012376	Yes, well now we know exactly when the wait will end.
4012456	4013857	We finally have a release date.
4014137	4021160	There was an official release date trailer that showed up this week, if you're into the super cuts of cutscenes and a little bit of gameplay in there and that stuff.
4021520	4025402	But we know the day for Dragon Age The Veil Guard is October 31st.
4025762	4027823	That's right, happy Halloween from Bioware.
4028704	4030945	The Veil Guard will be out on October 31st.
4031245	4035487	This is the first game in the Dragon Age series in, get this, 10 years.
4036607	4037128	That's right.
4038028	4041371	Inquisition can almost be a classic game of the week.
4041411	4045895	I think we have to get to the fall, but we are almost at the point where Dragon Age Inquisition could be a classic game of the week.
4045915	4046676	You are correct.
4046756	4048157	I checked.
4048678	4053122	So this game has been 10 years in the making, but I will say I've
4053602	4054503	I'm a fan of everything.
4054743	4057724	And I'm not even the Dragon Age fan that DarkSakura is.
4057824	4060886	I appreciate it, but I'm not super into it.
4061787	4064128	But even I was looking at the gameplay trailers and stuff.
4064148	4065388	I was like, okay, that looks pretty rad.
4065609	4067370	I want to check this game out for sure.
4067930	4069010	So, yeah.
4069030	4072332	Well, I know that the Inquisitor is going to end up back in it.
4072352	4076394	They've pretty much spoiled it for everybody already because they've had a bunch of...
4077655	4078375	articles go out.
4078395	4089780	They were doing also like a video a day kind of thing for a little bit with information and I'm honestly looking forward to a lot of these new characters.
4089800	4091841	Some of the designs are absolutely amazing.
4091881	4095883	Plus it's set in Tevinter which I expect there to be a lot of fabulousness.
4097787	4125452	also to point out just something that we've learned about the game there will be a diverse array of accessibility options including standard difficulty modes so I'm not sure if we can tone it all the way down to a Bobby Blackwolf mode so he can play the game but I don't know exactly how much we can tweak the game but it sounds like we'll be able to make the game easier or harder if that's something you're into and then custom settings to make different aspects of the game more forgiving
4126112	4152903	interesting so i wonder if you i wonder if you could just like turn off death or something and sometimes there's that sometimes it goes that far so uh we'll see we'll know more soon i'm expecting different things like switch control one arm controls you know that type of thing of course of course um colorblind modes um i mean there's all sorts of things and um i would even say descriptive modes yeah yeah i was thinking that too like last of us had yeah
4154733	4174725	and honestly more games need descriptive modes like that too it's like I mean it's something I've been doing if anyone is in like a stream of mine and expresses that they've got visual difficulties I try to be really descriptive it's not that hard to do you hire someone to narrate the scenery plus like
4175436	4189763	Oh, I was talking about, I thought you were talking about streaming because in streaming, it kind of gives you something to talk about if you're not like the type that is very good at keeping, or you don't have a busy, busy chat or you're just, you know, you're, you don't, you're still working on your interaction and doing that.
4189803	4193345	Like being descriptive is a really good way to kind of fill space and be helpful.
4193365	4194106	I agree with that.
4194166	4194326	Yeah.
4194426	4204211	And for me though, the being descriptive has been a really good exercise for me working on my, my novel.
4204751	4231697	hmm um that I'm finally starting to get underway is this what what do they fucking call that when they do November write a book in November the national writing yes yeah but I'm not doing it for that okay okay um I've I've been putting a lot of work into this I guess I'll talk a little bit about it um I'm doing them as serials hmm
4232640	4234901	So, you know, sort of episodic.
4235282	4246729	So the stories will be affordable and, you know, you have something to look forward to and then to be released as a full novel later on.
4247689	4248330	That's my plan.
4249050	4252352	With game sort of content to follow.
4252552	4258816	But that's a really ambitious project and it is on the back burner, but underway.
4258836	4259416	I'll put it that way.
4260957	4261758	You heard it here first.
4263424	4264724	Alright, let's move on.
4265005	4266465	DarkSakura, you actually have our next story.
4267525	4268546	I do indeed.
4269126	4272707	So, Silent Hill Ascension.
4273968	4277269	Wow, what a weird thing that was.
4278949	4284291	It won the Creative Arts Emmy Award.
4285626	4288347	for its existence.
4288487	4297752	And the Genvid CEO, Jacob Novak, said that just needed to put out thank yous for the team.
4298092	4302774	300 writers, artists, developers, QA testers, mocap performers, voice actors, and localization editors.
4303294	4305795	And then for Konami, Bad Robot.
4306576	4311158	They listed Behavior, Sinscape, Streamline, Google, and Eclipse Games.
4312539	4312759	So...
4314238	4323193	I think that it's cool we're definitely seeing more gaming and gaming franchises getting really big acclaim
4324758	4326739	Yeah, but this is interesting to me.
4326799	4333340	I mean, yeah, it's cool that it got an Emmy and probably like what they were trying to do is very unlike, you know, something we've seen.
4333400	4336741	But for the most part, it did not get received well.
4336881	4337622	I think that's the thing.
4338562	4341863	It's this very interesting sort of duality here.
4342163	4343143	Creativity, though.
4343343	4343923	Yeah.
4344243	4344563	Yeah.
4344643	4349065	So it's like the way of which it was delivered to the medium and the media.
4349545	4352506	But a lot of Silent Hill fans didn't care for it.
4352966	4353186	Yeah.
4354326	4360891	If that could get an Emmy, then... Maybe you think the Borderlands motion picture could win an Oscar?
4362372	4362572	No.
4363573	4375422	But I mean, when you think about it, you can have a movie that has really... Well, you can practically have anything that has really great concepts, really good...
4378697	4380439	What's the word I'm thinking of?
4380459	4384225	Amazing innovations in how it's produced and how it's created.
4385086	4388311	And it can still come out as a piece of crap.
4388611	4389553	I mean, just like...
4392631	4393832	I'm trying to think of examples.
4393913	4394653	I have an example.
4394834	4397817	How about the Wachowski sisters when they did the Speed Racer movie?
4397857	4400920	Now, some people love that movie, but some people think it's... I love that movie.
4401000	4403143	Some people are not fans.
4403463	4409049	But if it didn't win, it was nominated for an Oscar for costumes and visual effects.
4409810	4411092	Oh, yeah, no.
4411772	4413554	There's a bunch of just...
4417026	4422952	I'll put it this way, because you know me, I like myself some not great movies if it's got an interesting concept.
4425575	4436105	It's, I think, more of the thing that you can recognize when a product does not come out as expected, but still displays a great deal of innovation.
4437006	4439088	Like, you know, the Betamax.
4440919	4441600	Great idea!
4441900	4445483	Really, it was far superior to VHS, but what went out in the end?
4445984	4446524	VHS.
4446865	4447065	Yep.
4447705	4449587	Because VHS had the adult film industry.
4449607	4452970	Blu-ray versus HD, you know, DVD.
4453331	4453471	Mm-hmm.
4454612	4457995	You know... Because Blu-ray was built into the PlayStation 3.
4458095	4458255	Yeah.
4460638	4462459	Or, you know... Oh, here's an example.
4462680	4463360	The Virtual Boy.
4464802	4464982	Oh!
4465002	4465042	Oh!
4466530	4470773	It really did do a lot of innovation for what it was.
4470893	4471473	It was new.
4471534	4472254	It was novel.
4472334	4477978	People were excited about it, even if, again, it wasn't the best thing in the world.
4478338	4480019	As I call it, the great red migraine machine.
4481352	4495600	but it definitely was innovation for what it did it was something new and really you know created this new range of possibility for for entertainment okay that's a good that's a good analogy
4496460	4498561	Um, yeah, this is a very random question.
4498581	4499581	But now I have to ask it.
4499661	4501442	So of course, I talked about the Speed Racer movie.
4501482	4504023	And you know, Loki's like, I like that movie.
4504083	4504663	I like that movie.
4505043	4507064	Bobby Blackwolf said Speed Racer is amazing.
4507604	4512486	It's always my answer to my favorite movie that everyone else hates.
4513326	4519268	So now I'm going to ask you, and I know DarkSakura, I know DarkSakura is beyond a shadow of a doubt, but I'm gonna see if I'm right.
4519688	4521589	I'd like write it on a piece of paper or something if I had it.
4522109	4524490	DarkSakura, what is your favorite movie that everyone else hates?
4526877	4529078	I would say Xanadu, but now a lot of people love it.
4529818	4531218	That would have been my answer was Xanadu.
4531999	4534399	So I'm going to say Cube 2 Hypercube.
4535560	4536940	Oh, yeah, that tracks.
4538141	4538581	That tracks.
4539281	4545683	Again, because great concept, you know, but poor execution.
4546063	4547543	I can still find it enjoyable.
4547603	4551465	You know, I would also throw out an honorable mention of Robot Jocks.
4552205	4552485	Yeah.
4553712	4557936	Seriously, and I liked Alien Resurrection.
4560378	4567664	I liked Alien Resurrection as well, which is funny because I don't see a lot of Alien movies, and no, I'm not going to go see the new one, but I did see Alien Resurrection.
4567684	4568044	I am.
4568104	4568865	Who wants to go with me?
4570466	4570907	Loki does.
4572888	4578833	My answer, I think will be obvious too, my answer to this question, a movie I love that everybody else hates, Showgirls.
4579676	4591564	but like DarkSakura, I feel like Showgirls is one of those things where especially in the queer community, it's one of those things that people appreciate its badness now.
4592004	4601150	People are convinced that Gina Gershon absolutely knew what the fuck was going on with that movie from the very beginning and was acting exactly right.
4601711	4606814	Her performance was actually 4D chess in that game and I would believe it because Gina Gershon's amazing.
4607915	4609496	So yeah, Showgirls is my favorite movie there.
4609816	4611657	And anyone who doesn't like it, well, they don't know shit.
4611757	4612617	Yeah, you don't know shit.
4613977	4616658	You need to go eat some puppy chow.
4617398	4620019	I'm trying to think if I can even think of another one.
4620139	4621660	Like a movie I love that everybody else hates.
4622860	4624461	Like, I love the movie Sister Act.
4624601	4627142	I could watch that every day for the rest of my life.
4627362	4629022	But a lot of people love that movie, right?
4629482	4631083	Even though maybe it wasn't like a critical darling.
4632643	4632943	I know.
4634204	4635224	I thought it would be Goldberg.
4635764	4636985	And then I thought of Star Trek.
4637995	4639216	Star Trek Generations.
4639516	4640297	I love that movie.
4640437	4642698	I don't give a fuck if people say it's one of the bad ones.
4642738	4651464	I have concepts in it that I like, but I also... You know what we were watching before the show, before Dan left the house?
4651584	4652805	We were watching Wrath of Khan.
4654846	4655386	That's a good one.
4655406	4658989	And I do, for the record, like The Search for Spock.
4659229	4664272	I'm also going to throw that out there, that I did enjoy that movie, even with it being fucking bizarre.
4665653	4665733	Um...
4667245	4669250	So I'm just going to say that right now.
4669831	4671535	I'll get to Loki's answer in a minute.
4671575	4672477	And I like Silent Hill.
4673656	4674517	Oh, that's true.
4674897	4676097	A lot of people didn't care for that movie.
4676157	4676558	You're right.
4676618	4676858	You're right.
4676878	4677218	That's a good one.
4677238	4678199	And a lot of people are wrong.
4679499	4682621	DJ Ranma S is cheering me on in chat saying, hell yeah, Sister Act.
4682681	4683641	I love that movie too.
4684042	4685062	Rob, I got your six.
4685442	4686123	True story.
4686343	4687063	True story.
4687924	4692886	One of my friends, and y'all might know my friend VG Realness or Delvin was on a show called Video Game Realness.
4693127	4694047	He's a lot of fun.
4694087	4694267	I know.
4694287	4694848	He's great.
4694888	4699110	He came out here to Sacramento to visit for, it was a few years ago.
4699130	4700010	It was before the Panini.
4700030	4701031	I have pictures from that.
4701291	4702292	So it was a few years ago.
4702412	4706277	Yeah, so we got to meet and hang out with different people, but he wanted to go to Reno.
4706837	4709520	And I was like, Delvin, nobody wants to go to Reno.
4709681	4712324	If you think it's Vegas, it's not.
4712384	4715547	He said, no, I want to see the places from Sister Act.
4716488	4718789	and I was like, oh, okay.
4719289	4719749	We're going.
4719969	4723670	So we have a picture with the arch and I was like, that used to be the Fitzgerald.
4723710	4730411	That's where they filmed a lot of it, but it's now a rock climbing slash condominium thing because Fitzgerald's closed years ago.
4730491	4735672	But yeah, it's taken me to see all the sites of where they shot the movie Sister Act in Reno.
4735912	4736733	Oh my God.
4738613	4738713	Ugh.
4739600	4744143	And Ranma, if you ever come out here, I'll take you to Reno as well Reno!
4744523	4762893	And Gamora Alright You know what, okay, so Dan's job took him to Reno quite a bit I mean, it's not going to do it so much anymore But there, we used to stay at the Peppermill And they have a pretty freaking decent set of pinball tables there
4763453	4764114	The Peppermill.
4764214	4764914	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4764934	4767997	They used to have a badass retro arcade there, actually.
4768017	4769618	They still have a pretty decent arcade.
4769658	4775322	There's, like, redemption crap there, but for the most part, it's still pretty good.
4775382	4777204	I played, like, Star Wars pods there, too.
4777284	4778165	That was pretty fun.
4778325	4782148	And just, yeah, just, it's a nice little arcade.
4783389	4783669	All right.
4784470	4786871	Bobby Blackwolf totally derailed our show tonight.
4787032	4787352	Wow.
4787592	4787972	Wow.
4788112	4788793	Of all people.
4788933	4789473	Of all people.
4789553	4790074	And you know what?
4790354	4791255	It's not even food.
4791475	4792296	Et tu, Brute?
4792316	4792596	Okay.
4794811	4795891	Derailed the show.
4796712	4801536	Loki, what is your favorite movie that everybody else hates?
4801816	4803398	I know.
4804479	4804799	What is that?
4804839	4806760	I mean, there's Kung Pao Enter the Fist.
4807041	4807421	Yes.
4808302	4809363	The skateboarding movie.
4810922	4811703	Gleaming the Cube?
4812464	4825103	Nah, Gleaming the Cube's alright I would say I'm not a huge fan of Gleaming the Cube I've watched that, but like Rad, obviously is one Rad is awesome That's it, Rad was what I was thinking of Didn't you take your kids...
4827989	4829170	No, not Prayer of the Rollerboys.
4829410	4831511	I normally think of Airborne.
4831871	4835533	Airborne is a bad movie that I used to love watching.
4835833	4837054	That's also rollerblading.
4837855	4842137	But then more recently, Turbo Kid, for sure.
4842457	4847239	And then kind of a throwback one that I watched once, but I would watch again.
4847980	4848420	Wanted.
4849941	4851102	Gotta curb those bullets.
4851642	4851882	Yeah.
4853457	4855098	That movie was so stupid.
4855438	4856960	I don't think I have ever seen that.
4857280	4859202	Funny enough, it's a Marvel comic.
4860083	4860863	I didn't know that.
4861624	4864587	Oh, I do like the old Punisher movie.
4864627	4865628	The one with Dolph Lundgren.
4865808	4868190	And Masters of the Universe.
4868450	4884794	was one of the one where the guy took the keyboard and smacked the other guy and then all the keys pop off and say fuck you was that that movie yes that's wanted okay that was that movie was ridiculous I would say like yeah well it's not a bad movie but like you know Commando I mean
4885748	4886868	Gotta love Commando.
4887228	4887789	Stopping.
4888749	4888989	Okay.
4889509	4889749	All right.
4889789	4902453	We're going to get back into gaming news, but I have one more answer that nobody said that I know applies to all of us and all of you in chat, unless you've never seen it, which is certainly possible.
4902513	4909395	But I think y'all should go check it out if you haven't and see what you think of the movie from the 1980s, The Wizard with Fred Savage.
4910077	4910737	Oh yeah!
4911158	4911758	I love the wizard.
4912178	4913399	The wizard is so cute.
4914399	4915820	Critics hated that fucking movie.
4916180	4917061	Well, you know what?
4917201	4918201	Critics are full of shit.
4918682	4920943	Bobby Blackwolf points out the Super Mario Bros.
4920963	4922004	3 Nintendo Direct.
4922324	4925726	Wow, and I think the chat is saying, alright, I bitch, you got me.
4925906	4926366	You got me.
4927667	4928467	Rob Roberts wins.
4928687	4929388	Rob Roberts won.
4930288	4930528	Scores 1.
4931049	4931309	Alright.
4931369	4936114	There were so many good movies though in the 80s and 90s and stuff like that.
4936475	4937035	Oh my god.
4937155	4940099	Do you know what other movie I saw like 40 times on VHS?
4940179	4941420	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3.
4942721	4944163	The one where they time travel.
4944784	4945344	You know what?
4945544	4945965	I know.
4946065	4947506	I saw that in the theater four times.
4947526	4947887	I love that
4950636	4957145	True story, the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles started my thing of seeing movies that I super love in the theater in multiples of twos and fours.
4957946	4959248	Don't get me started on it.
4959528	4960850	It might be an autism thing, I don't know.
4961691	4966418	But I saw all three of them in the theater four times each.
4966929	4996134	and yes the only reason I thought of Ninja Turtles is because Tiger Claw's name popped up in chat and I was like oh the Ninja Turtles movie if you haven't watched it yet if you haven't watched it yet the new animated one that came out last summer I think fantastic like it's such a good movie I haven't seen it but you're not the first person I've heard say that it like it just it just feels right like I don't know what to say but like they are I think supposed to be doing another one so hopefully we'll see that it had like some
4997941	5012578	awesome association added to it like unhinged or something it's like something Mutant Mayhem that was it, that was really good that was really good
5013857	5014277	All right.
5014718	5015798	Back into gaming news.
5016199	5020001	Tiger Claw won and got his Ninja Turtles tangent.
5020262	5023544	So let's... And somehow Bobby Blackwolf enabled it.
5024365	5026406	It's a wild night here at VOG Network.
5026946	5027287	All right.
5027327	5030509	Let's get to... Honestly, it's a night of honesty.
5030729	5031209	It is.
5031269	5032070	It is a night of honesty.
5032090	5032690	It's a night of honesty.
5033151	5033631	All right.
5034772	5036573	Let's go to this.
5037534	5039415	This is honestly what the fuck.
5039855	5043218	Loki, this next story is honestly what the fuck.
5044195	5054199	You know, this, I think we can categorize it as franchises that are circling the drain that are just trying anything to, like, stay relevant.
5055180	5057321	So... Like, where did that shark come from?
5058661	5064363	Uh, Charles E. Cheese, um, is... Oh, we're using the legal name!
5065484	5067425	Yes, Esquire, the, uh...
5069706	5072487	Not Charles Cheese.
5072507	5076927	That's like when your mom says your full fucking name because you know you were busted.
5077307	5089450	Well, don't forget about his French cousin, you know, Charles de Fromage.
5089470	5092770	Charles Esquire Cheese, you get your ass down here right now!
5094771	5096531	Was he the new member of Wild Stallions?
5101286	5107852	So what obviously could possibly not be, there's no way it could be a scam with the name Fun Pass.
5108913	5114438	So it's a Fun Pass because it's fun to pay monthly fees to go to an arcade.
5115139	5117661	They have three tiers because of course they do.
5117881	5118622	Why wouldn't they?
5118642	5119463	Because they're causing tiers.
5120693	5125715	So, you know, the bronze tier, which no one cares about because it's bronze.
5125896	5127276	I mean, that's like third place.
5127356	5128097	Who wants that?
5129297	5132739	It's $8 a month, gets you 40 free arcade games.
5133139	5135960	Free, even though you paid for them, but yeah, sure, whatever.
5136720	5139362	Discounts off of pizza, 20% off pizza.
5139442	5143483	Sorry, Loki, I'm losing... For pizza that's only 20% good?
5143643	5146385	I'm losing my fucking mind at this comment in chat.
5147405	5150409	The SGM100 Matt said, Buka to Chucky.
5151711	5152552	Buka to Chucky.
5157287	5158087	So they have that.
5158127	5160869	Yeah, you get like 40 arcade games and discounts or whatever.
5161129	5165351	Then, of course, they also have other passes.
5165451	5175397	So the top end is the gold pass for $30 a month for 250 free games, 50% off other purchases as well.
5177378	5181900	You have to be really going to Chuck E. Cheese a lot, I would think, to do this.
5182040	5186283	And then once again, the whole point of doing this in the first place would be to just...
5187230	5192491	Get you kind of hooked in in the sense that, well, I'm paying for this, I gotta go, and then you spend more money.
5193132	5194852	Chuck E. Cheese doesn't even have DDR.
5195112	5202094	Like, if Round 1 did this, like, fuck it, I know people would sign up for that, but Charles doesn't even have DDR.
5202354	5207536	Yeah, so, I don't know.
5208316	5208756	Cool.
5209756	5210256	Good luck.
5210756	5211277	I don't want it.
5213417	5213917	Better games.
5214177	5215778	Get some DDR in there.
5217145	5241120	Alright, you know what, more power to those that want to go, but yeah Oh, oh, oh, hold on, and then the best part about it Chuck E. Cheese monthly memberships may be cancelled any time after the first 12 months They lock you in for 12 months, like it's some sort of cable Like a fucking cable Like it's a gym membership, it's the worst type Gym membership or something like that
5242560	5245821	It's the unhealthiest gym membership ever.
5245841	5246161	What?
5269352	5271293	Oh, I know what he's talking about, the lawsuit.
5271633	5285158	So somebody is suing a Disney park for a wrongful death lawsuit, but Disney is saying that it has to be arbitrated because by signing up for Disney+, they willed all of their arbitration rights to Disney.
5286758	5287098	What?
5287498	5287718	Yeah.
5288158	5288839	No, I shit you not.
5288859	5289799	This is a thing.
5289879	5290759	It's a wrongful death.
5290819	5294220	Like somebody... Was it that he died at a theme park or on a cruise or something?
5294240	5295161	Yeah, it was a theme park.
5295181	5303003	So it was in Walt Disney World and they went to a place that advertised itself as... Oh, that's right.
5303023	5303563	It was a restaurant.
5303643	5304404	It was a food allergy.
5304704	5305164	That's right.
5305184	5306244	It was a food allergy.
5306264	5310285	They were basically advertised that they could cater to people with food allergies.
5310545	5310686	Yes.
5310726	5314747	They asked many times while ordering and while receiving the food...
5315467	5318930	You know, you did take care of this so there's no food allergy stuff.
5318950	5320491	We're not going to have a problem.
5320551	5325134	And for legal reasons, I'm going to say this is all allegedly because I'm not fucking with Disney.
5325354	5326735	I'm not fucking with Disney.
5327075	5330558	Yeah, so allegedly that all happened and then she died.
5330858	5338183	And then so now they're saying, oh, well, because the husband purchased a trial to or... No, it was a trial.
5338223	5340305	Everybody in chat is saying it was even a trial.
5340325	5341025	It wasn't even a thing.
5341546	5341686	So...
5341966	5344368	Yeah, so it's just it's ridiculous.
5344468	5351954	Yeah, and Bobby Blackwell says this is reported by this is like a CNN story and like, you know, news outlets that this is not like a fucking TMZ thing.
5351974	5353755	This is like legitimately being reported.
5354295	5357117	So do you like how I say it's not TMZ?
5357177	5358078	It's actually legitimate.
5360140	5360400	All right.
5361584	5362325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5383272	5384293	I don't know why I stopped.
5384313	5386155	Oh no, I do know why I stopped Anstream.
5386175	5387236	You know why I stopped Anstream?
5387577	5394645	Because it worked on the Xbox One, but for the longest time it didn't work on the Series X. And I thought that was the silliest thing.
5394705	5398329	I wanted to play Anstream on my console and it wouldn't work on my current console, so I got rid of it.
5399290	5399610	But...
5400291	5403935	and Stream has announced they're going to be coming out on PlayStation consoles now.
5404076	5404596	Finally.
5404676	5405998	This is really overdue, y'all.
5406378	5407499	But I'm glad it's happening.
5407860	5410343	And Stream is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5410663	5416069	And PlayStation games are going to be coming to the service, which is pretty cool.
5416209	5416570	Except...
5417791	5425800	I think these are like these are deep cut PlayStation games like ODT Escape or Die Trying, Tiger Shark, Motor Mash.
5426260	5430365	So these are going to be things like We Got the Rights Real Cheap, which OK, whatever, whatever works.
5431946	5437352	Also, which I thought was really interesting, Pico 8 is going to be added to AntStream and some games that they get on that.
5437412	5438133	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
5438813	5467568	if you didn't know Anstream it is like a legal emulator but it's not actually an emulator because it's a cloud service it's a cloud gaming service so you're actually running classic arcade games and console games and all that shit off the cloud so that's pretty cool and a lot of fun so yeah so if that is of interest to you you can check that out it's on Xbox it's on Playstation it's on PC it's not on the Switch yet but if it would I bet they would get more subs on that as well even though of course you're
5467588	5468909	If it's not on the Mac, it doesn't count.
5470709	5472670	I haven't looked into that to be honest.
5473170	5476371	But we'll do some research and get back to you.
5476832	5483034	But in the meantime, since I brought up classic gaming in some form, I think we might as well do this segment.
5493655	5500945	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5501425	5504029	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5504690	5507693	Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
5508555	5509175	Why do you hate me?
5510222	5510883	I don't hate you.
5510963	5516827	You do because you're going to go to do that panel and not even bring me back a souvenir.
5517067	5519569	This is an attack, and I want to explain why.
5520169	5521030	This is revenge.
5521090	5529876	A classic game has to be at least 10 years old to be in this segment, and this is an attack picking this game and reminding me that this is 10 years old.
5530236	5531257	This is a personal attack.
5531277	5532338	How do you think I feel?
5533863	5534903	How do you think I feel?
5535023	5540105	What is the classic aging, old, like we all are, classic game of the week?
5541105	5542286	Stop it.
5543806	5548688	The classic game of the week is Shovel Knight.
5550097	5556624	So Shovel Knight was developed and published by Yacht Club Games.
5557544	5565632	It was crowdfunded and the game released on Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, and Windows in June 2014.
5566373	5568535	It's had many, many ports.
5568796	5569957	Other versions came out.
5570017	5571899	I will be discussing them soonish.
5573420	5573720	But...
5574501	5580583	It was one of the very, you know, considered one of the greatest games ever made by a lot of people.
5580944	5587206	And then it even had additional versions of it.
5587246	5592548	There was a story with the retronym Shovel of Hope.
5594649	5597910	And then there was the full game Shovel Knight Treasure Trove.
5598870	5599931	So I'll move forward.
5600971	5602272	Oh, and there's also spin-offs.
5602292	5603132	We'll get into that in a minute.
5604068	5607411	Anyway, it is a 2D side-scrolling platform game.
5608011	5613415	2D with caveats, because I think part of it is in 3D as well.
5613916	5615877	Like a 3D base for 2D stuff.
5618039	5625384	But anyway, the base campaign, retroactively titled Shovel of Hope, you play as the Shovel Knight.
5626285	5633811	And you have to go rescue his partner, Shield Knight, while fighting the Enchantress and Order of No Quarter.
5634560	5655187	and he can dig because it's a shovel he can shovel and bounce with his shovel like pogo stick kind of like Scrooge McDuck and his cane I keep thinking of the shoveler from Mystery Men I shovel I'm damn good at shoveling yes you are um
5657103	5671062	and so you have to fight the different knights from the Order of No Quarter you have checkpoints, you have boss battles stuff like that to go through treasures and then you can also find a salesman named Chester
5672003	5696109	and you can purchase relics using your treasure and they will give you different magical abilities like invulnerability or one that shoots fireballs upgrades, things like that and you can also find sheet music that you can give to a bard and that gives you the play test the sound test for the game's music
5697236	5714623	and then if you die in Shovel Knight you lose a portion of your treasure at the location of death and you can return to that area to get your lost treasure but if you die before you claim the treasure it's gone and you also have an option for challenge of destroying the checkpoints
5717452	5739824	so yeah there's all that you have a new game plus mode and so now we have the other things to come so we have downloadable content for features including challenge mode where you can do like speedrun or repeat battles a local co-op multiplayer DLC for you to do the main campaign in tandem
5740704	5745705	Co-op on Nintendo platforms using the Shovel Knight Amiibo figures.
5747346	5754368	Body swap mode where you can alter your gender or pronouns of certain characters in the Shovel of Hope campaign.
5754828	5759209	And then there were the other campaigns like Plague of Shadows, Specter of Torment, and King of Cards.
5759969	5783092	that have different playable characters who are boss characters in the Shovel of Hope campaign like you play as Plague Knight who freaking love Plague Knight you can play as Specter Knight and then you have King Knight who has like a shoulder bash attack and he also has a card mini card game called Justice
5785192	5808043	and then Treasure Trove has a fighting game add-on called Shovel Knight Showdown that is not released on 3DS, Vita, or Fire TV and so you have a four-player fighting mode you also unlock other fighters in the story mode
5809804	5818529	Yeah, these unique boss battles, like even fighting Kratos from God of War on PlayStation, or the Battletoads as enemies on Xbox One and Windows.
5819730	5824273	Nintendo 3DS has stereoscopic 3D and StreetPass Arena modes.
5824373	5830076	You can fight players' ghosts on StreetPass.
5831037	5837981	And so, basically, the designer, Nick Wozniak, he said that the game sort of started out as a joke.
5838701	5839521	and got serious.
5841342	5854727	So they took the sword thrust move from Zelda 2 Adventure of Link and other attacks like ideas from Castlevania 3, DuckTales, Super Mario Bros.
5855167	5863551	3, Mega Man series, UN Squadron, also known as Area 88, Dark Souls and pretty much
5864591	5865452	Put things together.
5865672	5870616	They knew it was going to be Shovel Knight, but Plum at Night also showed up in the suggestions.
5871157	5872438	They had the Kickstarter on March 17, 2013.
5873499	5880245	It actually hit all of its goals and exceeded and got like $311,502.
5880285	5880365	And
5887592	5899001	They also distributed some copies of the demo to people on YouTube and Game Grumps and a few other online ones.
5899522	5902784	And Shovel Knight was originally supposed to be a princess.
5904706	5908629	And she was referred to as Princess MacGuffin by the development team.
5909490	5911151	And so they...
5912532	5934611	and instead though for later on they did like the body swap mode and had the enchanter instead of the enchantress and you know different kinds of things they were looking at like different styles of characters and different things that they wanted to do but you know we ended up with what we got and then um there of course there's a chiptune soundtrack uh done by an NES era composer Jake Kaufman who um
5935531	5941535	We also had contributions from the Mega Man composer Matsumai Manami.
5942475	5944737	And the soundtrack is on Bandcamp.
5945497	5947278	And it was supposed to just mimic the NES.
5950880	5951180	So yeah.
5951680	5960304	So anyway, as far as the releases, it was originally supposed to come out September 2013, but came out in 2014 instead.
5961525	5965427	And so we had all those extras I mentioned earlier.
5966007	5972950	And then before 2017, the game was released with the name Shovel Knight, just Shovel Knight, and then DLC after that.
5973510	6001068	and then after that update they gave it the retroactive title subtitle Shovel of Hope and then of course the Treasure Trove so an enhanced edition of Shovel of Hope DX was announced in June this year to be released on Steam with 20 different playable characters, online multiplayer, rewind and save states in-game cheats and additional content and
6004173	6009215	The Ghost Battle Arena is coming back, formerly the StreetPass Arena.
6010155	6016458	So, as far as awards, oh my god, the game won a bunch.
6016618	6029243	It won Best Independent Game at the Game Awards 2014, Nintendo Life's Reader Awards, Nintendo Life Staff Awards, it won eShop of the Year games in multiple categories.
6030203	6039890	Um, uh, the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers that won Best 3DS Game, Best Music, IGN's Best of 2014, Best Platformer, Best Platformer People's Choice.
6040751	6043613	So, yeah, it really, really did.
6043653	6049017	There was the Amiibo figure, as I mentioned earlier, and it was the first Amiibo that was produced by a third party.
6049577	6067106	and then there was an Amiibo 3 pack with Plague Knight, Specter Knight and King Knight came out in 2019 and with a gold variant of the other Shovel Knight figure there was Arby's toys I didn't know there were Arby's toys I don't really eat fast food though I had no idea there were Arby's toys, wow
6068576	6084572	Shovel Knight also appears in other games, including Indie Pogo, Blade Strangers, Cook, Serve, Delicious Kitchen Battles, Move or Die, Dino Run DX, Runner 3, Riverbond, Rivals of Aether, Blaster Master Zero, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night.
6085192	6095340	Road Redemption, Epic Manager, Sea War, Star Mazer, Rainbow, All Stars, Dungeons and Diamonds, Ghost Police, Mutant Mud, Super Challenge, Pixel Noir, and Mighty Quest.
6095960	6098542	Also cameos in Brawlhalla, Super Smash Bros.
6098662	6102325	Ultimate, Azure Striker, Gunvolt 2, Two Brothers, Yooka-Laylee,
6102965	6109887	Aegis Defenders, River City Ransom Underground, Puzzle Depot, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Enter the Gungeon, Katana Zero.
6109927	6110867	There's just a few of them.
6111688	6114949	And there's music that shows up in Just Shapes and Beats and Voice.
6115769	6119030	So there are spinoffs 2020 February.
6119090	6122131	There was Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, which is a dungeon crawler.
6122771	6125692	And then there's Shovel Knight Dig.
6126292	6126433	So, um...
6137345	6142308	It was initially released on Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, and Windows.
6142749	6145651	Then it was ported to Mac OS and Linux.
6147292	6153616	And then after that, PlayStation 3, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox One, and then Amazon Fire TV.
6153716	6155497	And after that, Nintendo Switch.
6156738	6158839	So, there you go.
6160120	6160640	Shovel Knight.
6161441	6163402	Like I wasn't going to eventually do this anyway.
6164002	6164783	I know, but...
6166101	6166421	Really?
6166541	6168763	I remember I backed this Kickstarter.
6171185	6171445	Same.
6171985	6172306	I know.
6173086	6173547	Totally did.
6174227	6174527	All right.
6175008	6177650	Shovel Knight is your classic game of the week.
6179171	6180712	Like it or not, because of the age.
6180752	6186616	I think most of you will like it, but maybe not because you realize that you are also 10 years older since this game came out.
6187857	6188537	But you know what?
6188718	6188898	What?
6189787	6214758	we got to experience a lot of cool shit we have we have I mean we also got to experience some shit shit but you know still yeah the planet earth is four billion years old but you exist at the same time that Dolly Parton exists never forget that it's important Dolly Parton is a fucking treasure all right um Bobby Blago says it's amazing that you backed a kickstarter so early that it was able to come out in time to be a classic game in 2024 I know right
6216616	6219019	I'm also like, Kickstarter's that old at this point?
6219059	6220360	Yeah, yeah, I guess it is.
6220520	6220901	Oh boy.
6221882	6226867	Alright, let's check out some other headlines real quick in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
6227007	6227208	Loki.
6228618	6237043	Alright, so we have the TimeSplitters PlayStation 2 trilogy coming to PlayStation Plus this next week.
6238264	6242406	So that'd be TimeSplitters, TimeSplitters 2, and TimeSplitters Future Perfect.
6243066	6253652	And then along with that, also The Witcher 3 and Ride 5 are going to be available on PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
6254933	6255974	That's right, they have tiers.
6257790	6259391	I'm glad I don't have to worry about that anymore.
6260131	6261712	I have tears paying for stuff.
6264853	6266434	Anyways, other things.
6266634	6272277	So we've got also these Retro Realms arcade games.
6272777	6276139	They're being put together by Boss Team Games and WayForward.
6276799	6285724	They're working on two horror kind of 16-bit games, one based off of Halloween and the other one based off of Evil Dead, which kind of...
6286684	6286904	DarkSakura
6313277	6324021	So, I don't know if I should facepalm at this, but it does sound like this article is saying they scraped the bottom of the barrel for movie adaptations.
6324741	6326482	But Eternal Champions!
6327962	6328922	Eternal Champions!
6329303	6329703	Remember?
6329723	6331443	Barely.
6332264	6333244	It's getting a movie treatment.
6333264	6333304	Um...
6337680	6362968	it is uh i'm trying to see who it was that was going to be doing this out um so yeah it i i don't know how i feel about this but um i just hope that somebody gets shoved off a building that's all i'm gonna say you know the stage they had the stage uh kills what they call them
6364565	6367066	I don't remember what they were called.
6367446	6372248	That era of the mid-90s fighting game, or late 90s, you always had to have some type of finish thing.
6373749	6377550	Interesting, Tigerclaw says it's being written by the screenwriter of the Jurassic World movies.
6379551	6382352	Yeah, well those aren't that good either, so, you know.
6382592	6383192	Overkills.
6383592	6384893	Overkills and sudden deaths.
6386148	6389750	Yeah, I'm with DarkTetsuya who says, I'm about the same place I usually am for these.
6389930	6391990	Show me a trailer and I'll decide where I am with it.
6392331	6392511	Yep.
6393131	6395812	Do you want to know how I got my last copy of Eternal Champions?
6395852	6396712	And yes, I've got a few.
6396932	6397833	How?
6398013	6400054	Buying an activator at Virgin.
6400754	6401234	Oh, wow.
6401994	6403475	Not too long after I moved out here.
6403915	6404275	Wow.
6404955	6405956	How is that?
6406276	6410137	And that Virgin megastore became Urban Outfitters is now a party city.
6410758	6412278	I thought it was the Barnes and Noble now.
6412899	6413779	No, that's the place next door.
6415319	6415640	Okay.
6415720	6415940	Yeah.
6416501	6417503	But it's the same area.
6417623	6417924	Yeah.
6418284	6418946	Yeah.
6419226	6421029	But that is the, yeah.
6421230	6421550	Wow.
6423093	6427400	And I remember being new out here and going, oh my gosh, this place actually exists.
6427781	6428182	Yeah.
6429392	6430833	Oh my god, Virgin Megastore.
6431114	6435117	I remember the one in San Francisco we would go to to get like import albums and shit.
6435137	6438400	Like it's the only place you get like Kylie Minogue import B-sides.
6438540	6439601	Yeah, amazing.
6439721	6445046	I bought Dan's first Christmas present at that Virgin.
6445106	6445326	Really?
6445346	6446687	And you know what I bought him?
6446787	6447207	What was that?
6448108	6450731	The Last Action Hero on Laserdisc.
6450791	6452092	Nice, nice.
6452677	6459842	Alright, well, hey, while we're talking about a trip down memory lane, maybe some of you are going to be into the Sunsoft Retro Game Collection.
6460342	6463244	It is getting a local release on the Switch.
6464164	6474631	It was originally going to only be for the PlayStation 5, but now it's going to be a digital version on the Switch as well, coming out on the 6th of September.
6475652	6481996	And it's going to have three games in it, which is Firework Thrower, Kantaros, 53 Stations of the Toad,
6482376	6484217	to Kaido is one of them.
6484818	6487500	The Wing of Mandula is another one.
6488240	6490542	And Ripple Island is the third game.
6490762	6493724	Now, I don't know if any of these were really released in the US.
6493764	6505152	I think a lot of these are Japanese games, but they are also, you know, for example, the director of The Wing of Mandula was also the director of Blaster Master, which was another big Sunsoft release at some point.
6505212	6505332	So
6506012	6516694	I'm sure some of you that are into your more obscure and lesser known 8-bit era titles will be very excited about this or it's a chance to discover something brand new.
6517994	6525015	Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out a little sooner than that this week in World Release Dates.
6525095	6525355	Loki.
6526175	6527996	Not a lot, but we got some big things.
6528096	6533197	So starting off with Black Myth Wukong on PC and PlayStation 5.
6534077	6534857	That's kind of a big one.
6535560	6536821	Yeah, it is a pretty big one.
6537422	6543487	Dustborn on PC and PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6544408	6546650	StumbleGuys on Nintendo Switch.
6546910	6549593	Is that like a ripoff of Fall Guys?
6549953	6550494	Sounds like it.
6552157	6565957	Mika and Witches Mountain on PC and Nintendo Switch Concord on PC and Playstation 5 and then Harvest Moon Home Sweet Home on iOS and Android That's it
6566664	6567305	All right.
6567805	6570707	Well, going to Japan, you know, last week we had no releases.
6570787	6574469	And honestly, folks, this week is not exactly picking up very well.
6574910	6577851	But we do have at least one release on the Nintendo Switch.
6578212	6581334	We have the NT Creates Gold Archive Collection.
6581694	6585957	It's a multi-pack that includes Mighty Gunvolt and Mighty Gunvolt Burst.
6586377	6591621	And hey, DarkSakura, you can get a puzzle game called Puzz Mix, where you mix it up with songs and puzzles.
6592301	6592361	Yay!
6592381	6592441	Yay!
6602492	6631410	Dustborn is getting a deluxe edition that's out in Japan this week as well I don't know why the regular edition maybe it's a digital only type of thing but yeah Dustborn is also getting a collector's edition in Japan this week otherwise kind of slow so we'll go to DarkSakura in the UK well and also looking at my calendar checking all this out it made me remember that I was supposed to do my marathon next weekend and not this weekend
6634175	6637337	Don't let me plan anything when I'm sick, okay?
6638498	6647643	Anyway, on the 20th, that is for PlayStation and Xbox, we have Dustborn Deluxe Edition.
6648683	6653506	22nd for the same two, Tiebreak, official game of the ATP and WTA.
6653626	6654527	Yes, that is tennis.
6656488	6661091	On the 23rd for Switch, Disney Magical World 2 Enchanted Edition.
6663372	6667735	Also for the Switch on the same day is Turbo Boost Racing Kit.
6668475	6668975	Interesting.
6669436	6670656	I think that's a peripheral thing.
6672097	6674239	We have Trek Winter Wonderland.
6675419	6679302	And also on the 23rd, we have Concord for PlayStation.
6682962	6683282	All right.
6683322	6695330	We have just a couple more stories for you, and then we will get to the listener roundtable where we will take any calls over on our Discord server, which I encourage you to join to talk to us throughout the week over at vognetwork.com.
6695350	6697752	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6698052	6699373	We'll also get to any emails.
6699493	6701454	Participate at orangezonsradio.com.
6701494	6704416	Although when I last looked, I think it's just a lot of pet pictures.
6704576	6707097	People are actually responding to your call for pet pictures, which is nice.
6707157	6707778	I got an email.
6708279	6709622	Okay, so at least we have one of those to read.
6709682	6712227	But until we get there, we got a couple stories.
6712488	6714933	I can always still use more pet pictures, though.
6715053	6715414	That's true.
6715454	6716717	You can never have enough pet pictures.
6717078	6717278	Loki.
6718191	6737095	Yeah, so I know when we heard about the announcement of this game a while back, I was mildly interested in it being that it is a VR version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which arguably is very old at this point.
6738075	6741856	It doesn't really feel like a good candidate for VR, but...
6742403	6752447	I won't have to worry about that because now Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the MetaQuest VR is on hold indefinitely while they focus on other projects.
6752968	6757830	And they say they look forward to working with their friends at Rockstar Games in the future.
6760871	6762352	Yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised.
6763772	6765853	I would not be surprised if this is cancelled.
6766654	6769395	Isn't that video game news for Not Gonna Fucking Happen?
6770390	6799860	I mean, it's like they're probably, if you think about it, they're they're like, okay, well the development time that we would need to convert this over to VR and put it onto the MetaQuest which, you know what are the real sales gonna be there versus eh, let's just put those devs on Grand Theft Auto 6, which is gonna make us billions of dollars I think the answer's pretty easy yep, yep
6801415	6828771	go make GTA 6 happen as fast as possible which will still be a process like honestly even if it did come out on the MetaQuest I can't imagine it would be good and I can't imagine that that would be like a system seller game for that platform like if it was Grand Theft Auto 5 VR okay we're talking there now and that's a thing that like people modded on the PC but like
6830356	6832397	Yeah, the Quest VR can't handle that.
6832417	6833959	That's why they're doing San Andreas.
6836000	6836320	Yeah.
6836741	6846527	Rockstar Games can't handle updating San Andreas either because they outsource it to cheap companies that do a terrible job of it and then they have to catch all the stuff in the future.
6846547	6848068	Yeah, I'm good.
6848909	6850150	We don't need a VR port of it.
6852478	6868526	Alright, well, one more story for y'all tonight that has to do with Gamescom, and this is admittedly very much a non-story story, but of course with Opening Night Live on the way, which as you know is one of the semi-annual events,
6869926	6875887	Entries in the Keelyverse, along with what we have, the Video Game Awards, right?
6876288	6880488	And then the Summer Game Fest would be the other two entries.
6881188	6884309	So he has a winter one, he has a late summer one, he has an early summer one.
6884369	6888930	I would say if he gets a spring one, then he'd have a very, very full year there.
6889010	6891451	But yes, opening night live is happening.
6891511	6893471	And yes, just in case you were unaware...
6894520	6901900	It is confirmed from Jeff Keighley himself, the Doritos Pope, yes, there will be new game announcements.
6903463	6905024	Oh my god.
6905164	6914030	This is an addition to existing announcements that we know are coming like Monster Hunter Wilds, Civ 7, Call of Duty Black Ops 6.
6914271	6918293	There will be some new games announced as well.
6919094	6920835	So something to consider.
6920995	6930462	Sega has said they will be showing off Sonic X Shadow Generations, but there's also an unannounced project they will be showing as well.
6930482	6930782	Hmm.
6933051	6934653	Fantasy Star Online 3
6949076	6952179	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6967833	6968774	DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
6997813	6998773	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
7013959	7019868	All right, well, the email is one and it... Why are you doing this to me?
7020489	7021570	Okay, there we go.
7021691	7027239	Okay, well, it's only one very quick email and it comes from Brad, PodCulture.
7027519	7027820	Hello, Brad.
7027840	7029262	I want a new Bioshock game.
7031189	7035832	Oh, because you asked when, okay, remember when I spilled coffee everywhere and you were filling time?
7036253	7040476	You said email us what game you want to see, a sequel to it.
7040496	7042557	Yeah, you know I forget what I do.
7042577	7046540	Brad gets a gold star for actually answering and saying he wants a new Bioshock game.
7046560	7050102	Congratulations, you actually followed the instructions and got the assignment done.
7050623	7051343	Congratulations.
7051363	7051904	Mazel tov.
7053024	7053084	Um...
7054212	7056574	And by the way, the coffee did not leave that bad of a stain.
7056674	7057594	I was very happy with that.
7057854	7058675	Okay.
7059696	7061917	Adventures in Homeownership!
7063278	7066580	I think you will get your Bioshock game if the rumors are to be believed.
7066620	7067100	Perhaps.
7067481	7069562	Could it be something we see at Gamescom?
7070022	7071283	I don't think I'd head my bets on it.
7071303	7074165	I think that's the type of thing you'd see in a PlayStation or Microsoft Direct.
7075065	7076807	But never say ever.
7076847	7078308	But if rumors are to be believed...
7078988	7079268	Yeah, yeah.
7106192	7108813	Judas was the name of that.
7108973	7112114	I should know that because it's a Lady Gaga single, but yes, it's Judas.
7115315	7115595	Rob.
7115856	7116076	What?
7118256	7121478	I'm just a holy fool, but baby, it's a Judas.
7121518	7123198	I still think Shies is a better song.
7124799	7125679	It wasn't a single, though.
7125699	7127060	It didn't have a video.
7127120	7127400	All right.
7129120	7130981	Loki, do we have any last minute stories coming in?
7131857	7132318	We do.
7132478	7134020	We have some fun stuff.
7134060	7135181	So let's start off with...
7136855	7139277	So tomorrow, we're going to be getting a Nintendo Direct.
7139577	7141218	It's the Nintendo Museum Direct.
7141458	7144500	No game announcements, nothing about the new Switch stuff.
7144540	7151105	It's all about the Nintendo Museum that is opening in Kyoto, Japan this fall.
7151605	7155227	And by the way, I don't think people should be too quick to write this off.
7155267	7157789	Like, yeah, understand the expectation.
7157829	7158870	There are no game announcements.
7158890	7160091	I'm not talking about that.
7160451	7164474	What I'm talking about is, what are we critical about with Nintendo all the time?
7165054	7166075	Game preservation.
7167295	7169317	Nintendo is now opening a fucking museum.
7169878	7173501	So I am curious from that standpoint to see what are they doing?
7173521	7175742	Are they going to have some games playable here?
7175762	7178865	I've got a Nintendo game for them that they can put in.
7179165	7180927	It belongs in the museum.
7181967	7183429	They'll put it in the bathroom.
7183669	7185891	They'll put it in the bathroom where it belongs.
7187981	7189982	I mean, it is in a museum already.
7190082	7193043	It's just, it will be in, I can put it in multiple museums.
7193503	7198204	So, so anyway, as far as like, what is Nintendo doing as far as game preservation goes?
7198665	7201405	Well, here's your chance to find out.
7201486	7206767	So that's all I'm saying is that, yeah, again, you're not going to see, and again, that doesn't mean more game releases.
7206847	7208508	No, that's not what this direct is about.
7209716	7210937	Stay in the right lane for this.
7211077	7211858	But I'm curious.
7213700	7217223	I bet it sounds like it's going to be the type of place where we want to go.
7217583	7218424	You know, there's that.
7218544	7222648	And don't forget, we had that news a few months ago that Nintendo's coming to Union Square.
7223208	7225250	So Nintendo's going to be on both coasts.
7225450	7232737	And I find, obviously, as somebody who lives a lot closer to San Francisco than New York City, I'm very, very curious what that's going to look like.
7232797	7233558	I'm very excited about that.
7233578	7236060	You know, there are more than two coasts.
7237947	7250552	There are, but I don't see them opening a Nintendo store in New Orleans anytime soon or Tallahassee or something along the Gulf Coast or I guess there really isn't a North Coast.
7250572	7252152	Well, I guess the Great Lakes maybe.
7252492	7253533	Chicago could get a store.
7253653	7255333	Yeah, Chicago could get a store.
7255353	7257594	I think Chicago gets the store before Tallahassee.
7259055	7261536	Well, no one goes to Tallahassee anyway unless they're like NASCAR.
7263863	7273469	So, and then the next bit of news I have is not shocking after its immediate failure in the box office.
7274090	7277992	Borderlands is coming to digital platforms August 30th.
7280174	7281415	That's fast!
7282535	7291902	And keep in mind, not necessarily the purchase, but, you know, I'm assuming another couple weeks after that and they'll be free, right?
7292082	7292302	Yeah.
7294005	7297567	Well, it's still not going to make any money if you have to pay $30 to rent it.
7297708	7306774	So yeah, I would say it's probably a very brief amount of time before it's on Max or Paramount Plus or one of those whatever.
7307114	7309856	What studio made, I don't even know, what studio made that movie?
7312078	7314519	Because that'll tell you what streaming service is coming to, that's all.
7316781	7317721	I don't know.
7317802	7318582	Let's see here.
7318822	7319603	It is...
7322549	7323570	Oh, Legendary Pictures.
7323670	7326413	I think most of their stuff goes to Max, but I could be wrong.
7326673	7327694	Yeah, that's Warner Brothers.
7328015	7328295	So.
7329036	7329336	Okay.
7329416	7329636	Yeah.
7331338	7331638	Yeesh.
7331859	7332159	Yeesh.
7334221	7334521	All right.
7334581	7335202	Way to flop.
7337344	7338705	Any other stories for us, Loki?
7341072	7348094	Bully's been rated for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC in Taiwan.
7348435	7349335	Interesting.
7349635	7351736	Maybe it's coming back.
7352156	7353696	Oh, maybe that's a Gamescom thing.
7354396	7354756	Maybe.
7354877	7361158	Maybe Rockstar is like, we need something to keep the lights on until Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out.
7361178	7364339	Because as if Grand Theft Auto Online wasn't making them enough.
7364940	7367820	We need something to keep, it's a Bully, a redo of that.
7367920	7369541	Or maybe they're going to do a new game.
7371525	7387663	I wouldn't give this one no, because this one is the Canis Canem edition which came out a while back, so it's not a new one I could see them doing a remaster or port or something like that maybe
7390640	7391040	All right.
7391260	7394741	Well, with that, it's time to wrap up the show and get on out of here for the night.
7394781	7396021	But we will be back next week.
7396341	7398942	We're going to talk about whatever happens at Gamescom this week.
7399002	7400102	It could be very interesting.
7400182	7400922	So stay tuned.
7400942	7405563	We'll be back in seven days to talk all about that before we are off for the Labor Day holiday.
7405683	7407004	So we'll have a fun show next week.
7407084	7409704	I hope you're here in seven days to do it all over again.
7410084	7413225	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
7413525	7418346	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7418766	7425948	So tell a friend or two or five a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube, Spotify, wherever it is you found this show.
7426328	7429669	That goes an awful long way as well, so we really appreciate all of that.
7430549	7431349	Let's get final thoughts.
7431389	7436870	We'll start with DarkSakura, who I am assuming is going to be off into the Dead by Delight adventures.
7437611	7438571	I am not this time.
7438991	7439811	I'm going to play Palia.
7440191	7440831	Okay, okay.
7441612	7442232	Just because...
7443965	7446528	You know, I wore myself out yesterday, and I can't believe I'm so stupid.
7446568	7451574	I have it on my calendar that it was supposed to be on the 24th, and instead I did it yesterday.
7452995	7454076	So, you know what that means?
7454317	7455178	You could do it all over again.
7456308	7456428	Peace!
7456448	7456508	Bye!
7486207	7488108	Well, Loki, that brings me over to you.
7488168	7489389	What's your final thought for us tonight?
7490510	7495055	Hopefully I'll have another episode out on this week at some point.
7495475	7498257	Then I'll work on editing that down.
7498357	7502201	I've already got it filmed and built and I just have to edit it.
7504376	7508620	And my final thought is I don't really have much of one tonight.
7508800	7510541	I hope everybody has a great week.
7511162	7513183	I'm very excited for DragonCon on the horizon.
7513944	7517526	And just very thankful it's going to be an awesome, awesome year.
7517546	7520469	I mean, it's always an awesome year, but it's going to be an extra awesome year.
7520949	7523491	So with that, we'll see you in seven days, everybody.
7523691	7523991	Good night.
7526373	7528635	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7530799	7531299	See you next week.
