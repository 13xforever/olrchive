17191	19113	Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
39315	41656	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
41917	45419	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45559	55905	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 1012 of our show for tonight, August the 4th of 2024.
57566	63670	My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by my awesome co-hosts and yes, as Jason said in the intro there,
64170	65652	Jason in person Jason in person
80972	94881	But you get to watch all of us creepily as we tape live over at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, where Orange Lounge Radio is broadcast every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
94941	96422	And yes, we are all back together.
96902	103166	It feels really good because I feel like it's been literally a month since we've all been here, but there's, you know...
103826	105187	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
131531	132932	It was so good.
133132	134914	It really, it was so good.
135775	138116	All of the jokes I wanted were there.
138397	139297	Everything.
141539	145803	I don't want to spoil a certain cameo, even though I think it's been spoiled for some people.
146823	148845	The soundtrack is really, really great.
148865	149445	But I...
153214	169280	and for me being like a Marvel multiverse comic person there were so many things my favorite although and this is even from the trailer like my favorite little snuff like like snub is what I'm saying was uh Liefeld's Easy Feet
171213	172514	Deadpool, Deadpool, Deadpool
196592	198533	Well, I mean, except he's actually doing it with his hands.
198553	199153	Yes, he is.
199373	208517	You should, I'm going to have to just, there's like a website dedicated to just how off his art is, but it is iconic.
209177	214279	It is iconic, and he gave us Deadpool straight out of New Mutants back in the day.
215440	218241	So many nods on there for actual comic book readers, too.
219144	220765	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
238095	262769	I've never noticed just how many pride flags are of varying differences like obviously I see an ace flag and I'm sure there's some other stuff in there I can't really see you have a ton of pride flags kind of all on the bookshelf behind you no it's great I love it of course I keep acquiring them and then I just shove them in my bookshelf yes you have a choir of pride flags behind you but I the two that are in the back I have my love is loved one that I made
263489	289723	and then the one underneath that it's supposed to be the pride colors but I actually did the ace flag and the bi flag and some of the stuff for parafemale okay so it's it's it's my uh mythicals okay my mythicals pride flag I I I love getting to peek in your office and all that fun little stuff and I really should get to put stuff up on on the internet
290216	309284	Keep honking, I'm also a goose who is pretending to be human Fear not, comrade, our day will come This is a bumper sticker she's holding up on camera It is, I'm going to put a magnet backing on it Because I have the one that says thoughts and prayers But it's crossed out and it says legislation and reform Mm-hmm
311101	315184	I don't like to put stickers on my car, but I do magnets.
315304	319387	I have magnet backing that I'm going to put that on and then put it on my car.
321169	327134	If I need to trade in the Doom thing, at the very least, it's not going to have all the stuff all over it.
328515	335320	Let's also say hello to and welcome back to the show because I really feel like it's been about a month with all the shows we've had to cancel, unfortunately.
335741	336961	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
337745	338085	Hello.
338326	339387	Hi, how are you feeling?
340307	340448	Eh.
341348	341649	Yeah.
342169	344071	I don't, I'm negative for COVID now.
344231	345112	Hooray.
345392	349276	I did go out to see Deadpool and Wolverine today, though.
349536	351218	The day he was negative, he was like, bye.
351818	355602	No, no, I've been negative for like a week, but like, I... Well, that shit stays with you.
356383	374441	I'm just still tired and I still have like the like I have like other like abdominal pain too like which I I'm thinking is part of the stuff but I don't know yeah and then um just it's just tired you know a lingering cough but it is kind of going away it's been getting less each day
375202	376484	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
392482	394363	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
414850	433943	technically it never tested as COVID but like come on like what what else causes a buffet of unexplained symptoms where like it's like what's with the pink but the but the pink eye and everything I don't know because no it did because she gave me antibiotics didn't go away so no it wasn't even okay
434443	435524	So it was viral, for sure.
435544	446570	Well, then that could have been, like, true conjunctivitis, because that would... Actually, no, they were saying... Because I have a sinus infection, and I knew it was a sinus infection when I took the second swab out of my nose.
448351	455675	But bacterial infections can lead to secondary, so... Yeah, I don't know.
455695	458256	Yeah, if it didn't do anything for that, then you had to have been viral.
458618	459740	Yeah, so I don't know.
459840	463284	But the worst part of all that was the sore throat.
463304	468611	I mean, the pink eye was the biggest annoying part, but the sore throat was kind of like the lingering thing.
468631	472076	So I almost wonder like, oh, do I just kind of have that going on?
472356	473678	Again, just remnants of that.
473758	474119	I don't know.
474239	474860	But yeah.
475200	478725	So we've been a little broken here and old at Orange Tons Radio.
478766	480288	So again, we weren't here last week.
480328	481289	That wasn't planned.
481369	484294	But unfortunately, Loki was out with COVID.
484414	490283	DarkSakura, we kind of knew she probably wasn't going to be here because she was on her way back from California Extreme, which we'll talk about during our gaming weeks.
490723	491844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
517455	520538	So yeah, it's been quite a month, so sorry about it.
520878	526744	We're not trying to be irregular, but as I said in the beginning of the show, shit happens.
527105	527806	So there you go.
528687	530168	But we will try to keep going.
530569	534493	I will say we will have a show off that is planned.
535093	541558	At the end of the month, Labor Day weekend, I've been taking that show off for over a decade because of DragonCon.
541938	550204	I will be at DragonCon out in Atlanta, and I definitely encourage you, if DragonCon is on your radar, you're in the Atlanta area or the Southeast U.S.
550285	554588	at all, or have the means to get to DragonCon, get there for sure.
555308	557690	Because DragonCon's a lot of fun.
557750	558911	It's going to be a lot of fun this year.
558931	561153	I'm really excited for it, so stay tuned.
561173	562934	It's also a very important weekend for me.
563493	565197	That's right, because your anniversary is around then, right?
565818	568986	September 1st is mine and Dan's 19th anniversary.
569407	571171	And the day after that is my dad's birthday.
571472	572133	Happy birthday, Dad.
572799	574501	Yeah, it's a massive...
593897	597260	I guess the term would be a total conversion.
597340	604225	So it's essentially a mod for Fallout 4 that completely... It's like a whole new game, essentially.
604666	608349	And what's cool is they add a lot of cool elements from other Fallout games.
608409	614173	So there's a different skill tree in it, similar to Fallout New Vegas.
614213	614854	They have different...
617209	619169	specialties that you can get.
619189	622410	There's positives and negatives with them as well.
623370	627211	It's really cool, but it's completely voiced by voice actors.
628451	629291	It looks incredible.
629351	637093	I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet, but I have some friends that have played it, and they are very enthusiastic.
637113	641433	Essentially, it's the new Fallout game you've been waiting for.
641473	642514	The way it's done.
642994	643974	I'm very glad that...
645777	671762	Microsoft and Bethesda have let it exist you know what I mean because yeah like they could easily just smash this be like oh you know you're trying to represent your game like Fallout but no it's a really cool looking game well and surely they have to see the benefit of you know Fallout is an aged game at this point so anything that makes people interested in it again wanting to stream it download it engage with it I mean that's that's a win so you know
672302	678525	and Kudos to the modding community who oftentimes doesn't get appreciated enough for the hard work they do, but that's incredible work.
678645	679166	It really is.
679686	680226	So, kudos.
680246	686669	Yeah, I mean, I could see certainly a scenario where it sells more copies of Fallout 4 for Bethesda, so...
687990	691733	Well, and is this one of the official ones you can get on the console versions, too?
692073	694315	I don't know if you can get it on console.
694375	697157	It is on good old games, though.
697537	700119	So you can download it through them.
700239	702521	Quest Buster Clarify is not consoles.
703281	707044	I just know some mods are available in the Bethesda, yeah.
708208	713119	Yeah, so I don't know if it... Yeah, I don't think they would ever have it on consoles.
713160	717149	I don't know if it could handle that, but PC for sure.
717650	718091	Interesting.
719228	724111	SSJ100 Matt in chat says all part of Todd Howard's plan to get people to buy Fallout 4 and Skyrim again.
725973	728274	I don't think Todd Howard likes Starfield to sell some more copies.
728334	728935	Yes, exactly.
728955	731256	He'd probably like you to buy that game instead at this point.
731356	732157	Exactly right.
732977	744945	Yeah, even I saw some scenes on I want to say TikTok of all places of that mod and it was a scene where they were destroying the giant Ferris wheel in London and it was a whole like exchange and you see it.
744965	745085	Yeah.
745585	746186	Yeah, the eye.
767401	768701	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
789926	790827	There's no good news.
791587	798269	I mean, maybe one headline towards the end of the show, but there's a lot of not great news going on in the industry.
798950	801031	And I don't know what to think about that.
801211	804172	It's just... Anyway.
807573	809614	It's a bunch of crap, really.
810527	810847	I don't know.
811268	813589	I will flesh out my thought as we tackle some of these headlines.
813709	824157	I also want to state we are going to be sprinkling in some headlines from last week, the show we missed, because there are some huge topics we want to talk about and kind of give our viewpoint on and get your viewpoint on.
824457	828980	So we're going to sprinkle some of that in here as well, because some of you in chat will say, that happened last week.
829040	829560	Yes, we know.
829901	831762	We're going to play catch up a little bit with some of the big headlines.
832442	832803	You know what?
832823	834223	Some of us are doing other things.
834243	834544	So, yeah.
834564	834844	It's fine.
834944	836125	It's fine.
836625	840669	So, but let's start off with something from this week, which is, you know, a bummer to hear.
840809	841510	DarkSakura, please.
842390	842871	All right.
843131	860687	So it's been a good run, but Game Informer, which is definitely one of the last gaming magazines out there that, I mean, even was very recently quoted with a massive spread about the new behavior game, well,
861514	866097	and other company that brain farted about the casting of Frank Stone.
866918	868399	They had a big ass spread on that one.
869339	873462	But after 33 years, they are shutting down.
873522	875303	GameStop is closing them out.
875343	876944	They've laid off their staff.
878611	879732	They didn't give a reason.
880332	892284	GameStop didn't reply for a comment other than that, quote, every expense of the company must be scrutinized under a microscope and all waste eliminated.
892885	896528	That's an email that was obtained by Kotaku.
898290	900772	I don't know if they were supposed to get that email, but...
901773	917019	Referring to one of the most trusted magazines or the people that you're paying as waste, that's very, very, very poor, poor sign.
918400	921541	Poor is a kind word in this scenario, to be fair.
922042	926023	Poor is a very professional word to describe this.
926083	927724	I'm a fucking professional, okay?
927744	928304	Yes, you are.
931690	959476	but another thing that was published by their put up by their editor-in-chief Matt Miller for Game Informer about the post I'm going to just read the quote hard times, layoffs, cancellations and closures have impacted thousands of game developers and publishers as well as other outlets like us that celebrate games sorry Ferret, you have to get laid off no, that's not how it works I
961710	961850	No.
963270	971793	These are people that you're talking about in jobs and they are, I mean, as someone who is probably one of the laid off people, I mean, I feel it.
971933	972593	It's terrible.
973553	975194	You know.
977814	983736	They're one of the most trusted magazines in the industry and now they're gone.
983856	989438	I mean, and trusted being that this was a resource from GameStop who has been in the shit.
992341	1008850	yeah um but yeah there was uh it's and a lot of people have come out of the woodwork to show their love and support you know and so here is uh what it says on their uh subscription page
1009870	1022984	The Final Level, Farewell from Game Informer After 33 thrilling years of bringing you the latest news, reviews, and insights Oh, bless you for your Oxford comma Actually, you know what?
1023104	1025066	Is this the official thing that was on their website?
1025647	1025827	Yeah
1026127	1028629	There is a lot of talk out there that AI wrote that.
1029169	1030010	What you're reading right now.
1030430	1031130	AI wrote that.
1031351	1037735	Yeah, because apparently people have plugged it into a... It did ChatGPT write this and it's coming up positive.
1038035	1039376	And there are some terms in there.
1039416	1041357	Bobby was dissecting this a little bit on his show.
1041597	1048862	There are some terms in there that really point to the fact that this was sourced with things that ChatGPT would source from.
1049623	1056047	And it is not the type of thing where ChatGPT can pull from the Game Informer closure message.
1056967	1057187	What?
1058888	1060008	It might have been taken down.
1060048	1061268	Let me just take a look myself.
1061809	1064249	No, I looked at it just an hour ago when Bobby was talking about it.
1064269	1065290	Yeah, that's disgusting then.
1065490	1066270	That's absolutely disgusting.
1066290	1067630	I mean, like, yeah, it's disgusting.
1067650	1069871	They can care enough to write something themselves.
1070731	1069871	100%.
1072672	1081334	100%.
1072912	1081334	Let the CEO write something by his own hand, warts and all, but he's too busy talking about his...
1082782	1085443	Thank you for stopping me because I don't want to give that any space.
1103939	1112782	Yeah, no, but I mean, Konami has come out, you know, with a statement about it.
1113022	1115202	We've had Naughty Dog folks.
1115502	1130247	We've had just so many people, accounts for Discord, Cyberpunk 2077, Assassin's Creed, Metacritic, and the not Twitter thing, I'm not going to say gaming, gave their...
1131385	1131985	Their nods.
1133086	1134927	Wait, wait, that website has a gaming?
1135548	1136048	What is it?
1137369	1137669	Never mind.
1137769	1138190	I don't care.
1138370	1138770	I don't care.
1139010	1139631	Blink Gaming.
1139971	1140231	Okay.
1140691	1143173	No, I'm like, what is that?
1143533	1144474	I don't, you know, I don't care.
1144494	1145375	I'm not going back to that place.
1145715	1147396	I'm just, I'm a little bit like, what?
1147496	1148417	Here's Farmville.
1149739	1168790	And to keep going, Kit Ellis, who worked for Nintendo for more than 13 years, marketing and PR, was pushing the artwork that had been on Game Informer covers, especially one for Breath of the Wild that was, honestly, I thought it was phenomenal artwork myself.
1170111	1175335	Other people were pointing out some of the various covers like The Witcher 3, Wild Hunt.
1177176	1181179	Tons of the covers just really going off about the artwork.
1181299	1183940	And then there was that...
1187077	1209746	repost about the chat GTP and funny enough Jason Schreier I'm gonna mispronounce that I'll just read this I told chat GTP to write a farewell message for Gameformer magazine and it sure looks a lot like the one that GameStop executives published this afternoon it really is like practically identical yikes
1210629	1211610	You know what's also cool?
1212050	1213611	Garbage.
1213792	1222478	They were still promoting and selling subscriptions to the print magazine up in just July 30th.
1222578	1227622	Someone in chat, just at Record WN in chat said, I just subbed with their standalone offer earlier this year.
1227742	1228583	Got four issues.
1228663	1229624	Was excited for it.
1230831	1234875	You know, when you consider this was the last gaming magazine in the U.S.
1234915	1236436	There's others, you know, around the world.
1236456	1244544	But this last one in the U.S., basically, that's, I mean, if you don't count like indie published things, you know, I don't know where you want to draw the line.
1244584	1249148	But basically, you know, of the large magazines, this was the last one.
1249228	1252791	And, you know, people wanted a piece of that or to fund that to keep it going.
1253312	1253872	So it's just...
1254853	1255313	This whole thing.
1257155	1261998	And to basically get rid of the archives of all the old articles is just trash.
1262558	1265059	Oh, yeah, because that 100% tax write-off.
1266460	1268301	100% threw it in the bin to be a tax write-off.
1268862	1274926	So they can say, oh, we're writing this off as a loss of all these views we're not going to get from what we put in the bin.
1275906	1279048	Just... I can't.
1279448	1280169	I can't either.
1280309	1281750	But you know who needs to be in the bin?
1283111	1283571	The CEO.
1287140	1298491	and maybe their social media people too oh yes, Loki why don't you tell us about this so this isn't even about well it's not but it's still about like GameStop open mouth insert foot
1299488	1300029	Exactly.
1300129	1306175	So, of course, as you may remember last week, we talked about how the Xbox 360 store has officially shut down.
1306676	1307757	You know, the end of an era.
1308057	1313463	And, you know, where most people would be like, oh, hey, you know, that's unfortunate.
1313483	1315826	You know, let's think about all the wonderful things that happened.
1316266	1321151	GameStop decides to come out on social media and says, bet y'all wish you bought physical copies now.
1322535	1335608	in an extremely tone-deaf announcement during that time, which then, by the way, of course, social media being what it is, everybody responded and just basically destroyed them.
1336228	1337730	Where am I going to get physical copies?
1337790	1338651	Not at a GameStop.
1339491	1339971	Exactly.
1340071	1346836	I mean, physical copies by that, do you mean like, say, Funko Pops or $90 games that are used?
1347457	1351019	Like, I'm sorry, it's just not happening anymore.
1351880	1358844	You're not going to be able to... Like, I've gone into a few GameStops to look at the used games, and the section that's there is so small.
1358864	1361566	Like, you just can't find anything anymore.
1362547	1362647	Um...
1363416	1368640	So it's just, it's ridiculous to even see them coming out and saying that kind of stuff.
1368860	1371001	Especially with like this coming out right around the corner.
1371062	1374484	Like, you know, bet you wish you bought physical copies.
1374764	1377406	Yeah, I bet I wish I bought physical copies of your magazine.
1377546	1379408	Oh wait, I can't because you shut it down.
1379868	1380168	Whoops.
1380989	1382430	How's that NFT project going?
1383410	1388834	Weren't you supposed to be like an NFT, you know, store online that you can sell and trade NFTs?
1388854	1389395	How'd that go?
1389915	1390936	How was that investment?
1391376	1392397	Really well, you know?
1393683	1394444	You know what's funny?
1394564	1397366	I'm thinking about... I don't use that social media site anymore.
1397386	1399088	I've obviously said that a lot.
1399148	1401370	Sorry, I'm not trying to be edgy, but it's just a matter of fact.
1401410	1402011	I don't use it.
1403032	1407055	But I do remember I blocked the GameStop account some time ago.
1407556	1412220	And it wasn't just because I don't... They sassed me with something.
1412700	1416944	And so I just said, like, fuck the... You guys can eat my entire...
1417825	1418666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1437355	1452574	Yeah, it's... Well, and then, of course, there's people responding to it, so they are talking about, like, for example, they had a copy of Xenoblade Chronicles that was for sale for $90 on their website, or you can buy it pre... Well, that was buy pre-owned for $89.99, or I guess somehow they also have a $84.99...
1455543	1475449	yeah um or there was you know where they're talking about how as an employee of GameStop there'd be games that they would consider unsellable and they just have to destroy them so no one would get to buy them or um you know just essentially just talking about all the other stuff you know they used to do bad trading prices and all that um
1476491	1486218	I mean, I don't, I can honestly say that I'll be surprised when in the near future we hear something about how all of them are shutting down, like at some point.
1486298	1489200	Like, I just don't, it's not a surprise.
1489280	1493402	And sadly, like, I'm not going to miss them at this point.
1493482	1498746	Like, they just have, they've been, they're a husk of what they used to be for years now.
1499126	1501828	Behavior did their own thing as well.
1503615	1508857	You know, they pretty much let go of all of their social teams as well.
1509197	1509477	Right.
1509557	1509817	Yeah.
1509877	1511578	No, I remember we got into that a couple weeks ago.
1511618	1516239	But with GameStop closing eventually, it's coming.
1516299	1518440	Like, yeah, I'm talking about like it's a thing because it's going to happen.
1518940	1520041	And I feel bad.
1520281	1521201	You know, my heart goes out.
1521261	1523182	I don't like being so candid about that.
1523342	1528744	I hate that because the people that really are getting affected are the people, hardworking people at those stores.
1529084	1532425	The people that are making minimum wage or just above it trying to just
1533045	1544170	Fucking earn their money to support themselves, whether it be college endeavors or even life endeavors or what have you, that have to pay for the horrible mistakes made at the top of the company time and time again.
1544670	1556636	I feel like these workers, when this day inevitably comes, these workers ought to be able to sue the CEO to get the CEO's bonus package out of negligence for how this company was run.
1557016	1558997	Yes, I realize this is a fucking –
1559577	1564458	Fantasy, and this would never be something that comes to fruition in America, but damn it.
1565498	1582381	I hate that time and time again, when GameStop closes, and it will, the CEO will walk away with a giant fucking payout, and these hardworking people that have tried their fucking best to upsell all this stuff you wanted to shovel all the time are going to walk away with nothing.
1582721	1584361	And that is fucked up.
1585281	1588182	Oh my god, so the email I was referring to earlier, by the way,
1589395	1590016	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1614386	1614946	All right, sure.
1615867	1616127	Okay.
1635803	1636684	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1654201	1656523	Prospering in retail means survival.
1656643	1658385	If we survive, we stay in the game.
1658445	1662668	Survival is avoiding the deadly sins that often lead retailers to self-destruct.
1663108	1664770	This is usually a result of the following.
1664950	1668193	Buying bad inventory, using leverage, and running expenses too high.
1668733	1674037	By avoiding these self-inflicted mistakes and focusing on the basics, GameStop can be here for a long time.
1674798	1675959	he literally said I'm not getting paid yeah
1692904	1714657	so so their response so you would think okay GameStop been getting savaged by people online you know because of their comments so what would be the response to that by social media do you think there'd be an apology or are they just going to double down on it so what they decided to do is um they
1715876	1721560	They linked the Kotaku article talking about how they're getting savaged by fans with a poop emoji.
1722141	1722661	Oh my god!
1723001	1723401	Oh my god!
1723441	1724482	I was gonna make that joke!
1724562	1725583	That really happened?
1726223	1727284	That really happened.
1731307	1731967	August 1st.
1733448	1734148	Poop emoji.
1734529	1735109	That's what they did.
1738932	1741994	It just... It's just... Ugh.
1743055	1743795	Their team sucks.
1744336	1745196	I hate GameStop.
1745436	1745816	Perish.
1746517	1746917	Perish.
1747377	1748178	I hate GameStop.
1748958	1749298	Perish.
1749558	1754641	And again, I am so, so, so sorry to the many honest people that work for that organization.
1755321	1758023	But I've had it.
1758523	1759984	I've had it for a long time.
1760924	1762485	But I've especially had it today.
1763686	1766387	It's gone to 11 today.
1767348	1768008	I've had it with her.
1771092	1791523	and then here's the best part there's people defending them and I just want to trash I don't give a do they have check marks next to their name because I don't really I don't give a fuck what they have I do not give a fuck what anyone with a check mark has to say
1794582	1799650	Bobby Blackwolf says he's probably not taking a salary, but he is still getting paid through stock dividends.
1799670	1799650	1,011%.
1800150	1800771	Anyway.
1811378	1832537	uh Questbuster says as a side note GameStop CEO is being sued by Bed Bath & Beyond for insider trading I love Bed Bath & Beyond what a lovely place unfortunately I think they were also at least most of the stores around here that was them closed but what a what a lovely what a lovely great set of set of memories I have at Bed Bath & Beyond anyway
1835066	1835566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1858162	1858903	and EB Games.
1859544	1860404	Remember Babbage's?
1860765	1861886	Did you guys have a Babbage's?
1862306	1865369	No, we did have EB Games and we had Funco Land was the big one around here.
1865909	1867691	Well, you know, Dan started off with Funco Land.
1867771	1869052	Oh yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all.
1869072	1871994	And they'd give you the paper that had all the prices on it.
1872054	1873856	Yes, because they used to advertise in magazines.
1875879	1896046	Anyway, so I, fuck me, I played a bunch of stuff So last weekend I went to California Extreme, and if I'm looking down at my phone so I can figure out what the heck I played But California Extreme, for those who don't know, it's classic gaming, arcade machines mostly, they have candy cab setups
1897086	1920698	um you know the Japanese you know sit down style um they had a music game section that honestly I didn't really get too interested in um but it was it was pretty it was pretty fun I mean and we actually stayed this time so it was nice just being able to take my time and wander around and I think I hung out more with dealers you know um
1922620	1928962	In fact, I did a drink of whiskey with one of the dealers that I chat with every year.
1929403	1929883	It was nice.
1930403	1933164	I didn't get my amaretto sour like I normally do.
1934445	1937626	And I had a really, really good flatbread pizza, but that's besides the point.
1938286	1940687	So anyway, let me see.
1942308	1945749	I got to meet one of my heroes, kinda.
1948010	1949490	Was Warren Davis.
1949970	1951171	Do we know who he is, everybody?
1953211	1980227	he created Q-Bert and really nice guy really nice guy we just chatted for a while he knows a lot of the Star Trek people it was very interesting he's just a really cool guy I went to the Kroll panel about the making of the Kroll arcade machine and then the home release
1982298	1985382	and actually he's interested in coming on the show.
1985782	1986363	I'd love to have him.
1986783	1988625	I have an autographed copy of his book.
1988785	1991068	But I will only speak to him in Qbert speak.
1996050	2022720	and I told him I had the best home version and he's like which one is that and I'm like the ColecoVision and he's like yeah I want to ask him how terrible that Playstation 4 version was he probably won't even know what it is he'll be like tell me about it just don't do yourself a favor just go play the Coleco version that's us together I used to love the Coleco version of Q-Bert that was like my jam it was really the best one
2023365	2031888	Actually, what I'd like to know, he probably doesn't know, and I wouldn't want to bug him about that, but I would love to have a Qbert 1UP machine.
2031908	2037089	I'm going to say that, and somebody in chat is going to link it and be like, here, Rob, you dummy.
2037649	2041110	But I just haven't seen one out in the wild, or it packaged with other stuff.
2041150	2043911	So if they have one, they haven't had it out in the wild in a while.
2044271	2045492	But I'd love to have a Qbert 1UP.
2046592	2052974	Remember, by the way, when I covered the old handheld electronic games?
2055529	2057710	There were a bunch of the ones that I covered.
2060211	2061532	I didn't buy any.
2062292	2071516	Also, I don't know if I've spoken about these, but one of the tables had the Atari 2600 Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
2071657	2072537	Oh, that's cool.
2074538	2076219	They were $700 a pop.
2077279	2082982	Someone else, while I was there, bought a piece of the original World of Warcraft server.
2084133	2085794	Oh yeah, I remember when they were selling those.
2085834	2087814	They auctioned those off for charity some time ago.
2088915	2089775	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
2090616	2092096	That was like $750?
2092236	2094497	Something like that?
2094517	2095438	There's a picture.
2095458	2107802	Alright, so also, now this made me happy, is that there was Gradius playing on a ColecoVision with the Super Game Module installed.
2108063	2110003	I know people are really able to see my phone.
2110944	2111024	Um...
2111904	2115226	But it's this big add-on.
2116047	2118849	If we were smarter, I'd have you send these pictures to me in advance.
2118869	2120050	I'll send you the pictures later.
2120550	2121771	I might make a video or something.
2121831	2123412	Yeah, it's going to take me time to compile it.
2123592	2132798	I was going to say, if you want to believe the leaks, there is a prototype Tetris and Q-Bert cabinet.
2133138	2134259	Oh, fuck.
2134919	2135880	Oh, that would be a good one.
2135900	2137501	Why is my camera all screwy now?
2137621	2138942	Because you were holding your phone up next to it.
2138962	2139262	That's right.
2139282	2150449	Yeah, I was going to say, Bobby just confirmed in chat there is no legit Qbert arcade one-up yet, which is a wink saying people have put it on their arcade one-ups because obviously you know people have hacked those things to run emulators.
2150910	2153712	So, which I don't know if I want to do.
2154052	2155393	Well, actually, I will say this.
2156013	2171133	My baby, sorry, Jamie, I don't mean to divert too much, but just quickly, my little, not baby Pac-Man, but my baby Miss Pac-Man Arcade 1-Up, I may be getting a different Pac-Man cab, and if I do, I might want to hack this one.
2172654	2175596	because it will overlap most of the games.
2175656	2176557	It just won't overlap Ms.
2176577	2178199	Pac-Man if I get the other ones.
2178299	2180861	So anyway, just saying that on my hack.
2180921	2181862	Anyway, sorry, Jamie.
2182222	2186947	All right, well, so yeah, stuff.
2187487	2191811	So as far as what I played, I played video pinball.
2193633	2218227	which honestly is kind of fun there was a group up there called Super Mad Ness that were doing rock covers of Nintendo and other video game franchises there was a guy, it was his first California Extreme who had CD-i games oh
2219199	2221381	And we got to talking for a little bit.
2221621	2222502	I played Journey.
2222682	2223423	I played Strider.
2224704	2226606	The joystick on that Strider was kind of messed up.
2226726	2227487	I played Krull.
2227587	2228688	I played Super Pac-Man.
2230509	2235234	So one of the tables that I spent a little bit of time at had a Paprium.
2237075	2237996	And he was selling it for $850.
2238436	2241319	And he was so mad about it.
2241960	2244342	There was also the JN Silent Bob Ball Brawl.
2247245	2273879	I played some Batsugun I played Oshaberry Proteus Arcade I played I have a picture of Dan playing Donkey Kong I played Kicks I played a lot of fucking Kicks My scores are on that Kicks If anyone sees S-A-K that is me Sock Sock I played R-Type
2275117	2278239	with another controller that needed some attention.
2279880	2280920	I picked up some games.
2281981	2282281	Hold on.
2282861	2285283	Well, while you're doing that, I just want to quickly answer a chat question.
2285343	2288745	Record WN says people bring their machines to the show, right?
2288805	2289485	Sounds awesome.
2289525	2295889	Yeah, that's basically what this whole thing is, is it's really a celebration of retro gaming and collecting.
2296309	2298991	And so private collectors bring their machines
2299651	2304554	machines to this exhibition hall, a hotel ballroom, I think.
2305035	2308097	I think it's technically a convention center attached to the Hyatt or whatever.
2308737	2312520	But they bring their machines to this, pinball machines, 80s machines, and so forth.
2312580	2319605	And that's why, as DarkSakura was saying, some of the controllers were a little wonky because they belong to private collectors and so forth.
2319885	2327030	But then they obviously have panels, vendors, and the vendors oftentimes specialize in how to fix these things up and all that.
2327836	2329977	Oh, and Rinchan is in chat.
2330858	2339763	Definitely saw them go through some Dodonpachi and also listed Devil Blade, Sai Daiojo.
2340423	2343185	But we played Nightmare in the Dark together and beat it.
2344966	2347187	That game, I freaking love that game.
2347447	2348728	I'm pissed it didn't come out.
2350029	2353651	So some of the games I picked up as I got Power of the Hired...
2355458	2357120	for Super Famicom.
2358181	2360023	And I'm going to reset my camera again.
2360103	2369213	And I got Wonder Project J. So now that I have these, that means I can play them for my retro night.
2369493	2371535	Wonder Project J fixed your camera, by the way.
2372436	2374218	Yes, Wonder Project J fixed my camera.
2377037	2378078	I got a bunch of posters.
2378999	2381440	Did you see what Melody got?
2381560	2382301	Our friend Melody.
2382901	2383722	She texted me.
2384643	2385784	She texted me a picture.
2385844	2389166	She said, do you know how much I spent at California Extreme this year?
2389186	2390447	And I'm just like, oh no.
2391007	2396551	And she replies, and it's a picture of her in front of a Foo Fighters pinball table in her house.
2396992	2399374	And I'm like, oh my god, another one of my friends.
2399834	2401995	Another one of my friends succumbs to pinball addiction.
2402996	2404818	Help, I'm surrounded by pinball addicts.
2405538	2410603	I may be ending up lending her one of mine.
2411183	2419510	But I did pick up, you know me, I'm not like the biggest of Pokemon fans, but I could not pass up this adorable Shichijiki.
2420551	2421031	That's cute.
2421252	2423013	So I looked at the yen sticker still on there.
2423033	2424074	It's like, so this was 500 yen.
2424294	2425375	I'll give you five bucks for it.
2425855	2427237	He's like, fine, because it's you.
2428510	2429010	That's funny.
2429931	2431352	It was the guy I shared the whiskey with.
2431592	2435414	I knew somebody in chat would say, Rob, it's your turn, which Bobby Blackwolf says there.
2436395	2438516	Probably not in this house.
2439677	2442299	It wasn't Oshaberry, it was Gokujo Parodia, sorry.
2444340	2449524	But yeah, I did watch Rin-chan succumb to the mermaid.
2451425	2455307	You just kind of have to bomb your way in with the mermaid, I swear.
2455327	2455367	Um...
2457276	2460979	But, you know, I wasn't really too excited.
2461159	2466903	Like, they had the Beatmania 3 and I always played the Beatmania 3 and this year I just didn't.
2467383	2468404	I didn't play DDR.
2468544	2471406	I didn't really play any of the other music games.
2471426	2474308	I just kind of, I don't know, wasn't feeling it for once.
2474848	2476509	And I'm kind of disappointed with myself.
2476609	2486656	But I spent a lot of time with the Candy Cabs and just like playing what, I think for me, this year was about people and I'm usually not
2487697	2495669	a very much people person I met a delightful artist I have to find where I put my badge but her name is also Jamie
2497482	2520960	and uh and she did these keychains i might be commissioning her for uh some art for myself but um she um i'm trying to find it's uh yojambo is is uh her online handle um but she did these adorable uh Baldur's Gate 3 like i have uh
2521380	2524761	Like a charm that's a starry and drinking from like a sippy cup of blood.
2526322	2530444	And I have one of Lae'zel and Shadowheart in there.
2530604	2531904	This is our get-along shirt.
2534565	2538567	So it was pretty, pretty fun.
2538587	2540067	I love her art style.
2540327	2541468	We talked shop for a little bit.
2542488	2543929	But mostly it was just like...
2545447	2549589	It was nice just to be able to stay and then soak in a very hot bathtub.
2549609	2551349	You were mentioning you were looking forward to that.
2551890	2552330	It's funny.
2552470	2554791	Yeah, Rin-chan, that was the artist there.
2554851	2555871	Yeah, she was there last year.
2556852	2560433	But we just stopped and was like, okay, do you spell it right?
2560453	2563354	And we were both like, yes, with an I-E.
2563855	2564295	It was funny.
2565606	2568449	But I had a really good time, you know, it was chill.
2569129	2582782	It was nice having the hotel room for another reason is because like sometimes that floor can get a little bit overwhelming or you might be a consumer whore like me and you need to go drop some stuff off or just drop yourself off.
2584143	2588848	I did a sit down for like a minute and then next thing I knew I had taken a 20 minute nap.
2589328	2589488	Yeah.
2591490	2601080	but yeah, it's I really, I can't speak highly enough of the convention center as well of
2604008	2605949	of the staff working it.
2606109	2610111	It was just... It was really just a wonderful time.
2610191	2615654	I mean, and Bobby, I get that having a room at Southern Fry Gaming Expo, even though you live 15 miles away.
2616674	2618115	We live a little bit further than that.
2618135	2625459	We're about two and a half hours of a drive, and especially with Bay Area traffic, please up.
2626459	2629741	But it was a really...
2631465	2632927	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2652006	2665862	and then there's always a Super Graphics that's there and a series of homebrew games, you know, Hither and Yawn and yeah, Atlanta traffic is hot garbage.
2666343	2666563	Mm-hmm.
2667003	2667704	Thanks to the Olympics!
2669286	2676576	Anyway, I just, I really, I mean, I know I've said over and over I've had a good time, but I really had a good time.
2677497	2683705	And the next day, like I said, I didn't know if it was COVID or chronic fatigue, but I was...
2684935	2685616	I couldn't move.
2685756	2691101	I was ready to be done when we got in the car, but I was still pushing myself to play different things like I wanted to.
2693003	2698108	Oh, and a 20-something year old tried to get my digits.
2699309	2699870	That's funny.
2700578	2701038	Nice.
2701058	2705680	We were like, I was like, oh yeah, I remember all of this when all I could get it was fan subbed.
2705860	2707280	I mean, like, that totally dated me.
2707320	2714682	Like, I remember being in college in the 90s and having fan subs of Dragon Ball Z and raw copies of Ranma 1.5 and getting all the Sailor Moon, blah, blah, blah.
2715082	2716003	And he's like, oh.
2716383	2721744	And so I'm at another table and he comes over and says, I hope this isn't too forward, but can I get your phone number?
2721904	2726666	And I'm like, and this is how I'm going to put people down gently from here on.
2727526	2728626	I can give you my email.
2729867	2730167	Hmm.
2733104	2738526	I don't like to use the me being married or with somebody else as an excuse because when you say no, no is the answer.
2739327	2745570	But I think he got the point and he was really nice about it.
2746430	2749812	But I was like, okay, okay.
2750472	2752553	My ego was a little bit stoked for a bit.
2752753	2754034	And I told Dan and he laughed.
2755934	2757755	That's not the response you're supposed to make!
2759076	2761058	You're supposed to go, wow, that's awesome!
2761938	2764320	No, I mean, he just, I thought it was funny.
2764380	2767503	I thought it was funny and adorable, and he was just like, oh, yeah.
2767743	2769304	And he looked a little gratified, so.
2770685	2775088	But yeah, that was my California extreme.
2775268	2777210	It was full of twists and surprises.
2777430	2778290	I'm glad you had a good time.
2778310	2782854	I'm sorry to keep missing it, but I was hosting a show on that Saturday night, so...
2783964	2784584	It happens.
2784845	2787265	But next year, next year, you gotta come.
2787406	2791047	Yeah, if there's not a conflict again, which there always seems to be one, but I'd love to go back.
2791187	2791787	I'd love to go back.
2791967	2798270	I would love to save up for DragonCon, but I've also... My big one is TwitchCon, so... Yeah, that's fair.
2798630	2801011	For me, TwitchCon over...
2802025	2802705	Yeah, I get it.
2803025	2806887	Big convention full of a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of people.
2808227	2808987	Loki, let's go to you.
2809047	2809908	How was your gaming week?
2810248	2811468	Conventions or otherwise?
2811628	2812688	I don't think you went to any, though.
2813389	2814829	No, I didn't go to any conventions.
2814969	2819311	No, I mean, it's been a lot, so it's been a month now.
2821011	2821652	Oh, let's see.
2822633	2825797	Well, I'm doing lots of Minecraft as usual.
2826238	2830743	I'm not making a whole lot of content because I've been busy behind the scenes doing a bunch of stuff.
2830883	2832886	To be fair, you've been sick as hell.
2833658	2836179	Well, yeah, but that doesn't necessarily stop me.
2836840	2844383	So I've been behind the scenes updating our server to 1.21, which is the new version.
2844803	2858010	And with that, there's a lot of server migration, mod updates, mods not being supported anymore, and I'm having to create workarounds to get stuff in the game that we had in there before and all that fun stuff.
2858470	2860271	So it's been a lot of work to do all that.
2860291	2861771	I'm still working on that stuff.
2863444	2869069	But I also did compete in a build competition with Ross Cumber.
2869329	2877337	It's her Build by Build event, which essentially is a charity event that supports diabetes research.
2878218	2884123	And they had a bunch of celebrity judges from Hermitcraft and other things.
2884143	2887006	So there's two Hermits from Hermitcraft and a few other folks that are...
2888486	2890567	One guy from Empires and stuff like that.
2891207	2893608	I did end up winning one of the categories.
2893908	2899670	So I had a pretty awesome build with Penko, which is the mascot.
2900330	2901230	It's like a blue cat.
2901850	2902811	And so I did like a...
2903951	2905512	I guess it's like a diorama, but not really.
2905592	2920840	It was a bunch of giant builds that were essentially Penko sleeping, and then there was some different dreams that the cat was having, so it was eating a bowl.
2921361	2921861	Penko?
2922541	2924843	How's that spelled?
2924883	2925903	Just like the breadcrumbs.
2926143	2926544	Oh, like Ponko.
2927164	2929465	Ponko, yeah.
2929565	2932347	I was trying to look up the cat because I wanted to see.
2933379	2934780	Yeah, I posted it on Twitter.
2935240	2936661	Oh, what a cutie!
2937522	2939083	Yeah, so it's on Twitter.
2939303	2954693	And so essentially, I built the cat sleeping, the cat eating sushi, doing a superhero landing pose, and then laying on a cloud, playing with the moon like a ball of yarn.
2955333	2978821	so I did all that and I won that most panko category which it was just they split it up in like um I think most creative uh most panko most blue most um judges choice and some other thing there's apparently also a cat called named panko a cat panko a cat but that's awfully cute I'm gonna see I'm gonna see your work
2980356	2985141	Yeah, so there's the build there.
2985161	2987003	It's kind of hard to get it all in one screenshot.
2988584	2988944	Wow.
2989905	2990486	That's really good.
2990506	2990826	Good for you.
2992025	2993446	Thank you.
2993926	2995307	And so yeah, I did that.
2995707	2996447	So that was fun.
2996688	3002831	And then I've been working on stuff for the theme park in Channel 64 as well as on another SMP right now.
3002851	3007573	We're doing a kind of a survival challenge thing that's all in a frozen world.
3007753	3009634	So there's not like certain resources.
3009674	3011015	I've been playing that as well.
3011876	3014217	But on Channel 64, I have two rides that I've got
3014777	3028773	I have a Crazy Mouse coaster that's going to be... It's sort of based off of the now... I mean, it was a long time ago that they took it down, but the Crazy Mouse that was at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.
3030094	3033118	Long time ago, but pre-Log Flumes there.
3033398	3033739	And then...
3035595	3036717	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3051431	3052191	Thanks for watching!
3074437	3077018	Drop Tower Ride that is in the game now.
3077498	3080379	So I'll be building that in an episode hopefully coming soon.
3080439	3081079	It's been a month.
3082880	3084600	So I've been trying to keep up on that.
3084680	3087101	But yeah, making progress.
3087921	3088461	It's pretty good.
3090482	3092923	Oh, and in other games, not so much in other games.
3093043	3098004	I did get to play some laser tag at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and I still have it.
3099825	3100565	I still got it.
3100865	3101806	I destroyed them.
3104225	3131321	and uh yeah I didn't get to play any games necessarily I did get to see an Indigroove 3 machine which I'm like okay that's not a thing but there it is um so that was interesting where the DDR Extreme used to be which I think is my machine but I don't know why it's still there so I maybe it's not from the boardwalk but that's where the guy said it was from originally but they do have three arcades so it's hard to say um
3132145	3137979	but yeah, it's been fun so vacation, you know, COVID and busy with other things
3138812	3139132	Alright.
3139853	3143275	Well, my give me week, I'm sorry to say I haven't played a lot of new stuff to talk about.
3143315	3147198	You know, I'm continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail.
3147658	3156904	I'm a little... I got a little blindsided by the fact that the Diablo 4 season ends on Tuesday, and I didn't finish the Battle Pass this time around, which is the first season.
3156944	3157425	I didn't do it.
3157465	3167852	It's not because I was disinterested in Diablo, but I just... I went full in on Final Fantasy XIV, so I don't know if I'll do the next season, which is very odd for me to say about Diablo, but I just...
3168252	3196309	I want to catch up on some other games I have some things I like to play I've actually still been playing the Nintendo World Championships game just going to get my scores I've really tried to clear every challenge with an A or better and I'm through most of the games I only have a few games left Kirby's one of them Mario 3 is actually one of them and there's a couple games I still have to do but I've done like I did Zelda 2 which I figured would be really hard and it was difficult but it wasn't that hard because you have to kill like all the bosses
3196889	3202591	The only one that's made you play the complete game so far anyway is the original Super Mario Bros.
3203092	3212376	All the others are like play a level in the game or clear something like... It's usually like 1-1 or the equivalent of the first stage.
3212816	3215697	Like the last Kid Icarus is beat 1-1.
3216117	3216738	And the last...
3217978	3220360	No, Donkey Kong actually is a complete game loop.
3220621	3222543	You have to beat a complete game loop one time.
3222623	3224685	So you have to do the ladders board.
3224705	3231411	You have to do the... I don't know what you call the board with the lifts and all that stuff with the little... Is that Pie Factory?
3232152	3233693	No, Pie Factory wasn't in the NES version.
3234014	3235595	And then the rivets board.
3236556	3239278	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3262699	3264720	Tonight, well, tomorrow morning at like 10 a.m.
3265100	3277546	So we were pushing these badges to unlock and I don't know how to explain because I know not a lot of you play the same game, but like it would be the equivalent of like spinning 10,000 Pokestops is basically what I don't know how else to say it.
3278026	3280007	So we've been going hard in that game.
3280047	3280587	No, it's not.
3280887	3281507	No, it's not hacks.
3281587	3282388	It's links.
3283108	3289391	So throwing the equivalent of it's 10,000 points at three points a link.
3290372	3296006	so you do the math like 3,300 links in the scope of two weeks and I was sick the first week
3297153	3300774	So I went hard on that game this week, but I did it.
3301194	3301655	I did it.
3302215	3303715	So yeah, good times.
3304455	3304716	All right.
3305856	3310878	Anyway, let's get into some more gaming news.
3311018	3312798	And unfortunately, it's not good news.
3313539	3314079	No, it's not.
3314159	3314559	No, it is.
3314699	3317340	It is more things that are going to make you angry.
3317420	3319701	I'm sorry to say, but we don't write the news.
3319741	3320441	We just report it.
3320501	3320741	Loki.
3321164	3323625	Life is pain, anyone who tells you different is selling something.
3325005	3342931	Yes, so Bungie is undergoing lots of changes with layoffs and massive restructuring as they incorporate themselves more into Sony and spinning off one of their in-development games into separate PlayStation Studios.
3345373	3350176	CEO Pete Parsons called it a difficult and painful day for the team.
3350816	3363723	Yes, I'm sure it's very difficult and painful for CEO Pete Parsons who has spent the entire time since they got purchased by Sony purchasing classic cars for millions of dollars.
3363984	3365564	I'm sure it's really tough for him.
3365965	3371148	So tough that he had to go purchase some more classic cars after this whole announcement came out.
3371728	3372708	So that's great.
3373389	3373509	Um...
3375783	3376564	Anyways...
3394346	3407310	There's something very satisfying about watching what's happening with him because CEOs need to be accountable, especially in these crass situations.
3407350	3409170	This is why people hate the rich.
3409930	3411311	This is why people hate the rich.
3412511	3415172	How did you get rich?
3416794	3430225	from the Destiny 2 community lead, Dylan Gaffner, who responded to the announcement from Bungie on Twitter saying, inexcusable industry leading talent being lost yet again.
3430666	3437892	Accountability falling upon the workers who have pushed the needle to develop or deliver our community time and time again.
3438312	3442175	Please maintain focus on those who have lost their position and income.
3442636	3444057	Offer help where you can.
3446767	3466679	And according to CEO Parsons, the statement going out, due to rising costs of development and industry shifts, as well as enduring economic conditions, has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development on entirely on Destiny and Marathon.
3466719	3474324	This means beginning today, 220 of our roles will be eliminated, representing roughly 17% of our studio's workforce.
3476298	3503946	and they're integrating it says we are deepening our integration with Sony Interactive Entertainment working to integrate 155 of our roles roughly 12% over the next few quarters but yeah I mean I don't really feel bad for him honestly and I feel that maybe pay the CEO less maybe pay them less because he's obviously not doing a lot of work here could he sell a car?
3505718	3507878	I mean, he could sell plenty of cars.
3507938	3509859	He's got, like, 20-plus cars.
3510239	3512159	And why does somebody need 20 cars?
3512839	3514039	Because he's a collector.
3514139	3514940	It's just his hobby.
3515640	3516300	Oh, okay.
3516320	3518500	It's just his hobby.
3518540	3518800	Okay.
3518900	3524821	Well, maybe I need to shut the fuck up because I have arcade machines behind me, but they're wrapped up.
3524841	3525761	They're sold at Walmart.
3526301	3534783	But, you know, I'm also not in this business of being so callous, but whatever.
3536371	3546919	I mean, yeah, so essentially, even like two months ago, he says a winning bid of $91,500 for a 1961 blue Chevrolet Corvette.
3549041	3555406	Essentially, they're all tracking this through the website Bring a Trailer, which is like an auction site for classic cars.
3557267	3563112	But yeah, I mean, I don't really... I don't feel bad for him at all, honestly.
3563132	3564013	It's just...
3565580	3569901	Well, and the people I feel bad for are the people on the front lines.
3570321	3577603	And I understand that Destiny 2 probably has been struggling a little bit and has not performed up to the expectations they had for it.
3577663	3591267	And my understanding is there is no plans for another – I don't think another – I'm sorry if I'm misstating, but I don't think there's another Destiny 2 expansion being planned because you know people are squawking that got laid off talking about what's going on, which I don't blame them.
3592268	3597032	and Destiny 3 is not in the cards.
3597773	3602678	So Destiny is essentially kind of you got what you got and that's it.
3603018	3605781	Now obviously Marathon is on the horizon and there's a lot of...
3607222	3632863	spiritual successor if you will sort of thing although I realize that's ironic as Marathon was Bungie's original title but I think we all know all these years later it's going to look very very very very different so yeah so I mean I understand that decisions were made that is causing Destiny to not need as many resources as it had before however who ultimately made those decisions?
3633363	3634484	Was it the hardworking artists?
3635525	3636005	Programmers?
3637166	3647368	No, it's investors and stuff like that because, once again, you have to keep making infinite growth, which is impossible.
3647769	3655650	But that's why we see this cycle of hiring and firing, layoffs and all this stuff, especially when they have a successful product.
3656591	3662112	It's to make that infinite growth happen so that the investors are happy.
3662452	3662612	Yeah.
3663206	3673573	because every game thinks it can be the next Fortnite scale, Genshin Impact scale game, Pokemon Go scale game that makes that kind of money.
3673813	3676315	Everybody is convinced that is going to be their game.
3676715	3678516	And the best way to do it is to copy it.
3678596	3682639	I'm not saying that's what Destiny is doing before you all want to fight me.
3683259	3683780	However...
3684660	3705963	as a free-to-play game, I think there were certain expectations of the marketplace based on the performance of certain other free-to-play games that I feel like these financial forecasters are consistently setting these companies up for failure by these way too unrealistic expectations that everybody's going to have the next big hot fucking thing in gaming.
3707057	3732095	and it's not that Destiny 2 is bad by any means and Destiny 2 had an audience even I played Destiny 2 a little bit and I thought it was kind of you know I'm not and I'm not a big shooty shooty bang bang game player but I liked it was kind of like oh it kind of has like RPG mechanics but it's like a shooter like it's kind of a neat little twist on it and I like the little racing modes were cute uh so you know there were things I appreciated about Destiny um but yeah I just um
3735205	3752562	it's just difficult to see time and time again these astronomical projections were made and people thought as a result their dreams would be fulfilled only to have them yanked away because oops we weren't being realistic anyway
3754403	3754983	Let's move on.
3755063	3763069	Let's talk about other news that's kind of a bummer, but nobody's losing their job, I guess, is the silver lining here.
3763149	3767472	And I believe in this case, the internet will have this live on.
3767512	3769993	And this is the closure of romhacking.net.
3771174	3776378	Ramhacking.net, of course, is a website where they really specialize in various romhacks.
3776818	3779260	Now, you may think of romhacks as a variety of different things.
3779280	3785484	You may think of them as very juvenile things where they've replaced Mario with a penis, things like that.
3785504	3792228	Because I remember when I was in college, those are the romhacks you would see all the time would be Super Mario, Big Penis, things like that.
3792589	3796872	That's, of course, where romhacking probably started.
3797492	3800654	But obviously it's come a long way and it's refined.
3800694	3811541	And while there is still that stuff, if you want to find it, there's a lot of pretty incredible things that ROM hacking has done as well, such as, oh, I don't know, translating games that were never released in English would be a pretty big one.
3812562	3820087	Fixing bugs in games that were released, even though they were buggy because to make investors happy.
3820447	3821128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3842470	3847092	and RomHacking.net was a huge hub for this type of stuff.
3847473	3851074	And RomHacking.net had been around about as long as this show, 20 years.
3852055	3854516	But they have decided to wind things down.
3855256	3858598	There's a whole lot of other talk about the why behind all this.
3859038	3860699	I don't think I really want to get into it.
3861059	3866462	We're just going to say, for whatever reason and various reasons, this site has decided to call it a day.
3867082	3871065	The good news is it doesn't mean all those ROM hacks are suddenly, bam, deleted.
3871125	3874847	Because, of course, once on the internet, always on the internet.
3875428	3884314	And the site database, including all of the files and images, not your account info, but everything, was submitted to the internet archive.
3884774	3890678	So all of those ROM hacks, today anyway, are on the internet archive of database and download files.
3890878	3891859	So that's pretty cool.
3893019	3896241	They're going to keep some parts of the site open, like forums and so forth.
3897444	3897946	That's it.
3898948	3899428	Otherwise.
3899568	3903491	Now, this doesn't mean that the ROM hacking community will die.
3904212	3904812	No, it won't.
3905472	3906573	I say give it time.
3906993	3911576	There will probably be a few people that are kind of competing so-and-so to be the next one to these websites.
3912017	3917701	But give it time, and I think the community will establish itself under a new banner and keep this sort of thing alive.
3919322	3923825	Because, yeah, I mean, we talked about earlier in the show when we were talking about Fallout London.
3924165	3928568	I mean, maybe ROM hacks and modding are kind of different things, but they're also kind of not.
3929168	3945346	you know like it is modding in a different kind of sense so it's a very talented community and it's gonna go on and it really comes out of a love for retro games and trying to do different things with them so yeah NinjaBuddy in chat says pour one out for romhacking.net yeah
3946908	3952294	SJ100Matt says, yeah, I was there recently for that silly ROM hack of Zelda 2 running on the Super Nintendo.
3952414	3952674	Yeah.
3953415	3954876	Dartetsuya said, funny story.
3954996	3960142	I tried to translate an Othello Game Boy Color game and it's actually still up for the moment.
3960242	3961944	Yeah, once on the internet, all on the internet.
3962404	3962564	So...
3963464	3972129	Yeah, QuestBuster says contributors will always find a way to get their stuff out, whether it's on GitHub or their own personal sites.
3972269	3972129	100%.
3972969	3979793	The community has not died, but it's just one of the big flagships, one of the big cornerstones of the community is sunsetting.
3980933	3989518	But hey, at least unlike the multi-million dollar GameStop corporation, they didn't delete the entire fucking archives as a tax write-off.
3990834	3992255	So thank you, at least to that.
3992536	3997740	Whatever drama might be going on behind the scenes, at least thank you for doing the right thing with that, romhacking.net.
3999382	4002184	All right, I think this one is technically from the week we were out.
4002284	4003686	However, it's a huge story.
4003726	4004707	We've got to talk about it.
4004747	4009331	Let's go to DarkSakura, who is muted on Discord currently.
4013644	4019652	So once again, there is a voice actor strike and it is about AI.
4020092	4028823	And honestly, I saw this coming because when companies are going right back and saying that they were going to do things that...
4029954	4033198	So they had agreements with voice actors and the voice actors were like, we didn't agree to this.
4034800	4036021	I saw this was going to happen again.
4037903	4044190	But voice actors are on strike because of the involvement in generative AI.
4046252	4071550	After has been in contact with major video game companies for more than half of the year and are now, you know, they wanted things like, you know, clear safety, protection measures, five minute breaks per hour of on-camera work, having an on-set medic when performing stunts, you know, things going in that we want to see happen, we want people's safety, but now artificial intelligence is the big thing.
4072711	4072791	Um...
4073912	4085660	Veronica Taylor, a video game actor who is involved in this, said that she found her voice in voice banks where people can take her voice, and this is a quote, and make it say things I never said.
4087662	4092945	Companies are saying they're offering AI protection, but union members say that they do not extend to everybody.
4095667	4101531	And people who do mocap, motion capture, they're afraid now that they're
4103240	4108648	The digital actions that they performed could be put in a database without their consent.
4110031	4112775	So, you know, this...
4115664	4119505	It's not that their work is just data.
4120586	4124387	It was done by an actual person who should be paid for their work.
4126607	4136450	And I understand as a designer, typically, if I do a piece, once I give that to my client, it becomes theirs.
4137290	4147514	But I also have it out there with the understanding that it's not going to be tore into pieces and reused for people who didn't pay me for it.
4147634	4148235	You know what I mean?
4149195	4157438	I'm not going to draw a logo for a company only to have half of that logo given to another company to use for free.
4158179	4158419	So...
4159898	4160799	I'm fully behind this.
4161360	4173473	I think that this is something, and I'm glad that we're getting this done still in early days of the technology because people are pushing this shit way too hard and I am not into it.
4173913	4174074	So...
4174659	4175419	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4194751	4221537	and the company and so forth but there are many many other people who do not support this especially though you know and if you consider James Earl Jones's motivation for doing it where literally he is getting to the point where he can't do it anymore it's very different than this you know like the voice actress you cited there who is just finding that her voice is being you know lifted for this type of thing and that is ridiculous and this is why people are so anti-AI art right now um
4222997	4234462	is because it is robbing people of these opportunities to do these sorts of performances for themselves when you see the generative stuff being lifted without their permission.
4234502	4241945	So these actors absolutely need these sorts of protections and need to be – yeah, I support them 100% in what they're going for here.
4242345	4244666	And actors in Hollywood got the same thing, so good for them.
4245458	4246239	That's between him.
4246279	4248380	That's not quite what I'm talking about.
4248420	4248700	No, I know.
4248740	4248880	Not...
4262150	4266054	He's not going to be added into a database for people to pretend it's not James Earl Jones.
4266094	4267855	His is specific to a purpose.
4268916	4270277	That's not quite the same thing.
4270577	4274400	AI is inevitably happening in this industry and can be a good thing.
4274480	4280565	I don't want to sound like I'm anti-AI because how are we going to get to 8K graphics and whatever is in the future and all this stuff?
4281066	4289293	AI that is trained on processes and art the company has created, that's how it's going to get there and tools that incorporate that and
4289853	4294015	Procedures that are usually a little more manual being a little more automatic.
4294095	4295235	That's how it's going to get there.
4295395	4301238	But that doesn't mean that you take that from other companies or people on the internet type of thing.
4301438	4303439	Yeah, that's where I'm at with it.
4304952	4309474	If I could, I would actually love to play a message from Jennifer Hale because we love her here.
4310014	4317737	And she actually put a minute-long message onto her Twitter account over at JHaleTweets where she's talking about this.
4318597	4319598	Will you say something, DarkSakura?
4320418	4321218	I just said let's do it.
4321318	4321939	Yeah, I'm going to do it.
4321979	4325200	I'm sorry to my co-host because the way we're raged, you're not going to be able to hear it.
4325520	4330462	But let me go ahead and play it and then we will sum it up because, yeah, I stand by her.
4330522	4331222	So let's do it.
4332409	4334230	Hi, Jennifer Hale, voice actor here.
4335511	4337452	I'm reaching out to all my fellow voice actors.
4338072	4342695	I am not taking any struck work and I ask that you don't either and I'm going to tell you exactly why.
4344015	4346597	We have to protect ourselves from something called generative AI.
4347592	4376085	what that means is that they could for example lift all my lines from previous Mass Effects etc and in not too long a time they'll have the ability to create an entirely brand new Mass Effect game put me in it without my permission and without ever paying me they are working on that technology now most devs don't want to do this most of the people in that negotiating room i don't think want to do this it's just a few corporate holdouts now ask yourself they're making a lot of money off this
4377128	4378089	Where's that money going?
4378830	4385137	It's going to the bonuses and the shareholders and the profit grabbers and slowly strangling the working people.
4385618	4387360	We actors are just the canary in the coal mine.
4388060	4389662	This money grab is coming for all of us.
4390223	4392005	Let's stand together and say no thank you.
4393627	4397690	She says that so, so well.
4397990	4398730	There's a reason why.
4398770	4400511	And of course, because Jennifer Hale is amazing.
4401132	4402593	She says that so well.
4402873	4404574	There's a reason why I wanted to play that.
4405174	4411418	Because number one, you notice how she says there at the end, this is the canary in the coal mine that's coming for the rest of us.
4411618	4413139	Voice actors are the canary in the coal mine.
4413179	4414100	She's absolutely right.
4414540	4419523	And when she says, she says, most of the people in the room don't want to do this.
4420083	4421965	It's a few corporate holdouts.
4422725	4436031	The reason why I played that is because it ties into everything else we've been talking about this evening about these companies that have ended up in these shitty situations because of bad decisions being made by higher-ups.
4436451	4445175	That is what the higher-ups want to do to cut costs, is they want to have an AI-generated Commander Shepard, which I will not accept as a Mass Effect fan.
4446754	4471890	um there's also uh SAG-AFTRA put out a TikTok as well I'll just link it for chat but it's on their official TikTok so anyway again I'm sorry I didn't get permission to play that but I'm hoping that Jennifer Hill would not mind uh me spreading her gospel around because I think she nailed it there so um thank you Jennifer Hill for saying that so and um big fan of your work so all right um
4473635	4474476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4490182	4496125	for those panels, just like it was a year ago when it was the film industry and conventions that had film actors and stuff.
4496145	4502087	It's going to be very interesting because they are not going to be able to talk about struck work, which is an awful lot of it.
4502108	4504028	I mean, there are some work that's outside of it.
4504048	4512712	You have a database you can search and all this stuff, but it's going to be very interesting to talk to those folks without talking about their work necessarily.
4513213	4513413	Yeah.
4514730	4519713	So I'm hoping for a quick resolution to the strike that is in the voice actor's favor for sure.
4520113	4523295	Yeah, SGO100Matt says, I don't think it will be as long as the film industry one.
4523595	4525696	I don't either, to be honest.
4526216	4527557	I don't, and I'm really hopeful.
4527577	4528618	I hope I'm not being foolish.
4528658	4529238	I'm really hopeful.
4529738	4537362	I will say the way this was all timed, they were able to do Comic-Con promotion because there's some video game content at Comic-Con.
4537403	4538983	They were able to, because it was too quick.
4539344	4541465	Like the strike happened the day Comic-Con started.
4541765	4543386	So they exempted Comic-Con
4543806	4554253	But other conventions after that, including one that might be very front of mind for me, is going to be very interesting to see what happens.
4554493	4567040	So fingers crossed that the voice actors get what they want and that hopefully there's some truth to what Jennifer Salehill is thinking is that most of the people in the room don't want this and they're able to get everybody on their side real quick.
4567421	4567661	All right.
4569093	4576996	Loki, I don't even know how to set this next article up because I'm over the age of 18.
4577777	4579398	And so none of this makes sense to me.
4579558	4581839	So you may have to explain some of this to me, Loki.
4582739	4583059	All right.
4583419	4584540	I will explain this to you.
4584640	4586241	Please.
4586521	4589902	Instead of explain like I'm five, I need you to explain like I'm 45.
4590062	4590602	Okay.
4592843	4596165	So let's step back a little bit.
4597608	4615560	So in case you haven't heard, and why would you, we are now in the age of 2024 where viral YouTube videos are now being made into full blockbuster production things by Michael Bay.
4617037	4618919	This is the reality that we live in now.
4619619	4627104	So, the new hotness that is out there right now on YouTube, Skibbity Toilet, is a... What?
4627424	4627884	What is this?
4628664	4634068	It's essentially, um, it's a series that has been running for a while now.
4634688	4635849	There's lots of different videos.
4636029	4637110	It is, um...
4638035	4645059	the Source Filmmaker stuff so it's all of the Team Fortress 2 Half-Life Is that related to the Scatman?
4648562	4666313	Not necessarily it's a different song but yes, essentially it is a character that was made of Half-Life 2 models and a toilet so it's head was coming out of a toilet and singing a song and then it spun off into this weird dystopian war thing with these giant machines and
4666773	4667534	Weird, creepy things.
4667975	4671899	And then Michael Bay is like, yes, I will make a movie and a TV series out of this.
4672639	4686213	To which I'm like... I mean, I watch this because it sounds like trash, but there will be explosions and if there is somebody going to do this, Michael Bay would probably be the perfect person to do this, but...
4687170	4687550	I don't know.
4687810	4697273	Anyways, so this was all, of course, created originally with help of, like, Garry's Mod and stuff like that to even create these characters.
4697613	4709997	So, it was really strange when all of a sudden that Garry's Mod is receiving a cease and desist, or a DMCA takedown of the Skibity Toilet characters.
4710357	4715079	Considering that that's not even really their you know, their
4715762	4716642	Thank you for watching!
4738410	4753758	That's been resolved, and that, according to the creator of the Skibbity Toys and stuff, that it wasn't from him, and it wasn't from the production company, and it may have been somebody posing as them, creating that takedown, or essentially...
4754538	4782464	and so now that's all been resolved but what hasn't been resolved is the knowledge now that you have that there is a movie coming from movie and TV show let's get that right coming from Michael Bay starring giant toilets and giant people with television heads fighting each other in a crazy war and with assets from the Source Engine like
4783902	4790624	How is that even a thing that is going to exist in the world now?
4791064	4795285	Can you imagine even outside of just this weird stuff?
4795345	4802006	Remember when back in the day Valve used to put out cool Team Fortress 2 animations?
4802146	4805707	Imagine someone saw that and was like, yes, let's make a movie out of that.
4806027	4813349	Except now it makes no sense whatsoever because it's this crazy storyline that involves giant toilets.
4814980	4816681	Oh, I'm sorry.
4816701	4818142	What the heck is going on?
4818162	4819543	That's episode one.
4819644	4820704	Is this... Not necessarily...
4840379	4860960	it's sort of kind of not really it's like distorted but episode one is nothing like you need to go like to episode like 60 or something so that's like the initial thing and that's what it started as and then it just gets stranger and stranger
4863336	4867719	Okay, so that's the trash that it is now, or was.
4868379	4876525	Okay, now you need to go to episode 60 or 50 or something like that and just see what it's turned into.
4876625	4885371	I don't like to talk about this man, but because it was a part of pop culture for a minute, I can't help but think of R. Kelly's Trapped in the Closet.
4885471	4891175	And I don't like to talk about him, and you all know why, but I can't help but think about that for some reason.
4891235	4892515	Okay, you said go to episode 60?
4894477	4903264	50 or 60, it's just gonna not resemble anything whatsoever here we go, episode 59, I think this says so close enough, right?
4903644	4921138	sorry everybody, let's take a look at this and now I'm just looking at this giant mech that looks like Legion from Mass Effect is taking off and flying and there's these cameras oh, there's the toilet
4922456	4924138	Oh my god, that's disturbing.
4925719	4926199	I can't.
4926459	4926719	No.
4929241	4930162	I'm not watching it.
4930242	4931603	This is what the movie's gonna be.
4932223	4933164	It's this type of stuff.
4942451	4944092	I'm tired of this world.
4944212	4945733	I don't want to be a part of it anymore.
4948175	4949296	I'm gonna become a Luddite.
4949912	4951133	I'm day one, man.
4951274	4952996	I'm day one gonna go see this.
4953196	4953817	Absolutely.
4956405	4957846	No, Rob.
4957926	4959208	Are children on drugs?
4960669	4969497	Because I can see that this is the type of thing that maybe you put on the TV while you're high as fucking fuck.
4969917	4972960	Like while you're like 420 blaze it.
4973080	4976202	Actually, I would say 4,200 blaze it.
4976242	4979806	That is what that is that I just saw.
4981147	4983489	And 12-year-olds, your kids like that, Loki?
4983509	4983589	Yeah.
4985273	4985613	But, um, yeah
5009278	5011440	Alright, so we all learned something tonight.
5011540	5015542	We probably didn't need to, but we're just... DarkSakura, we're just trying to be cool and hip.
5015562	5016263	Can I unlearn, please?
5016923	5030053	I literally feel like I'm one of those 80-year-olds on that fucking Grandpa Reacts and Grandma Reacts channel watching something that kids are into.
5030893	5033916	I just can't imagine how this is gonna work.
5033956	5036978	I mean, I guess they're gonna have to license that from Valve, but like...
5039754	5056531	now here's the thing is it actually going to come out or are we gonna see that this gets cancelled I can only hope that it comes out just because you like bad movies this is gonna be well I like Xanadu but that was better than this
5057865	5062727	This is just going to be whatever it is is going to be amazing.
5062967	5070609	It's just going to be the trashiest of trash and I can't wait to see Skivity Toilet, number one at the box office.
5074495	5081498	Oh, and then, because you know how, like, movie studios copy other movie studios, so it's going to be like, oh, man, what trend can we get on next?
5081578	5084499	And it's just going to be so much meme trash out there.
5084760	5085140	Oh, my God.
5085160	5085640	It's going to be.
5085780	5091022	Rin Mari is 100% right, though, saying, I mean, Emoji Movie, unfortunately, exists.
5091442	5095024	Like, and don't get me wrong, like, there's a lot of internet memes are really funny.
5095184	5101367	So there's this song out there, and, you know, I know you don't all listen to girly pop, but Kesha is back because she is.
5101667	5102167	I love Kesha.
5102487	5103008	and DarkSakura.
5127068	5132431	It is cinema excellence, and I highly encourage you to watch the Joyride meme video.
5133351	5135693	I traveled there and back.
5135753	5137293	It was incredible.
5137354	5141676	I'd play it for you, but I know that's a copyrighted song, so I can't play it.
5142236	5143657	We are getting Angry Birds 3.
5144037	5146679	Yeah, well, the Angry Birds movies are good, actually.
5146699	5148740	They're good kid movies, but...
5150826	5157622	Yeah, I mean, we've seen some, like, obviously some of these that are based off of viral videos, like
5159055	5160477	Have we forgotten about Pixels?
5160497	5161638	Remember that trash?
5162058	5163639	I did go and see that movie.
5163799	5165441	Damn it, what was the name of that movie?
5166321	5177831	It was based off the epic Twitter thread about the girl who they went to go do stripping in Florida somewhere and it turned into this whole big thing.
5178511	5179993	Alan actually took me to see that movie.
5180693	5183616	So yeah, we saw a movie based off a Twitter thread.
5184776	5186818	It was interesting.
5187058	5187638	I didn't hate it.
5187718	5190400	I was like, this is wild.
5191120	5195644	It was very much, if I would describe it as a meme, it would be the old lady saying, what?
5196304	5197425	That was me.
5201728	5206451	I think this is going to be great.
5207111	5211715	I can't wait for a future that has a new Michael Bay skibbity toilet movie because
5213391	5240148	Zola was the movie and I actually looked up Twitter thread movie and it was the first result Zola, that was the name of the movie the only thing greater than a Skibity Toilet I mean there's a lot of things greater than a Skibity Toilet movie but the only thing greater that I can imagine Michael Bay doing as a movie based off of like something in the video game realms would be a Michael Bay Earth Defense Force movie would be amazing and I would see that also day one
5240999	5241339	All right.
5242701	5247565	SSJ wants to know if the toilet... I think Michael Bay read Starship Troopers.
5249367	5252750	It would lose a lot, but I would still watch it.
5253070	5256253	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, is the toilet being played by Chris Pratt?
5258772	5259312	It's pretty funny.
5259392	5259633	Maybe.
5259873	5260393	Alright, maybe.
5261154	5264396	Alright, well, uh, if you... Oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
5265297	5273923	Have you seen... Have you seen the, um, style guide leaks of the Minecraft movie assets?
5274183	5276905	Like, what the mobs and stuff look like in that?
5277125	5277365	No.
5277665	5280247	That's a horror show coming very soon.
5280267	5280827	Uh-oh.
5282068	5283950	So that's right around the corner as well.
5284390	5286932	Also gonna see it day one, because it's gonna be trash.
5288522	5290304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5307242	5309003	Like the Winter Olympics and curling.
5309183	5309563	Come on.
5309663	5311303	Who doesn't love curling during the Winter Olympics?
5311443	5312784	And, you know, the Summer Olympics has this stuff.
5313104	5320466	And obviously there's lots of memes coming out of the Olympics, like the guy from Turkey who won the shooting competition who looks like an assassin.
5321206	5323506	And then a picture showed up of him and his cat.
5324147	5328468	And the caption was something like, you know, if someone fucks with that cat, they're dead.
5329454	5332635	That's like the show I just... I started watching Samurai Cat, by the way.
5332655	5333115	Oh, nice.
5333135	5334335	It just makes me think of that offhand.
5334835	5343597	And then, of course, you know, my perverted ass is thinking about the pole vaulter who lost because he knocked over the pole on the pole vault.
5343617	5344878	Because you know what pole vaulting is.
5345018	5346198	You go and you can't knock over the pole.
5346518	5349619	He knocked over the pole with his pole.
5352000	5352760	Unfortunately...
5354016	5355577	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5384818	5388760	And, well, the pummel horse guy is also loved by a lot of people.
5388860	5391721	Not for that reason, but just, you know, because he looks like a nerd.
5391961	5393762	He looks like a total nerd who does pole vaulting.
5393802	5394282	It's great.
5394422	5405247	Anyway, I'm not bringing up the Olympics just to talk about the memes, but, you know, yeah, Bonds006Chat says, These memes from the Olympic just confirm we should never have gotten internet.
5406427	5422275	or the opening ceremony with Gojira playing on the side of the oh that was pretty awesome I will say the Celine Dion performance if that didn't get you verklempt especially if you know I just care about Gaga
5423055	5448752	I know but you know all the stuff Celine Dion's been going through is really heartbreaking like you know her voice and the therapy and all that stuff and she at least was struggling she that was the first time she sang publicly anyway in like two years was the opening ceremony and like I'll admit it I shed a tear like it was it was gorgeous it was beautiful yes Gaga was great too but that was Celine Dion's moment yeah and Snoop at the Olympics I have to agree with that I love Snoop Dogg he's he's
5449878	5451719	He's like a fun grandpa right now.
5451739	5452460	He really is.
5452600	5453140	Uncle Snoop.
5453440	5453781	All right.
5454621	5456302	Anyway, what was it?
5456402	5456723	Oh, yes.
5457203	5467169	Unfortunately, I have some not so great news about the Olympics because usually a new Olympic Games means we're going to get a Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, right?
5467209	5471332	Like we got a Tokyo one before the Tokyo Olympics actually happened.
5471412	5474954	Thanks, COVID, because it was branded Tokyo 2020 because you all know what happened there.
5475555	5477996	But, you know, we had one for the Olympics before that and so on.
5478957	5481199	We don't have a Mario and Sonic Olympic Games this year.
5481660	5483221	And people are going, well, what happened there?
5483781	5501958	Unfortunately, a veteran behind the Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games series confirmed in an interview with Eurogamer that the decision to end the franchise rested with the International Olympic Committee, who has chosen not to renew the licensing deal with Nintendo and Sega.
5502018	5503960	So it lapsed after the Tokyo Games.
5504620	5515265	So unfortunately, according to Lee Cocker, who worked on most of those games in the series, quote, they wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports.
5516005	5522588	Basically, the IOC wanted to bring it back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money.
5523348	5528911	And so sure enough, there is a game that came out called Olympics Go Paris.
5529431	5531912	It is a smartphone, free-to-play game.
5532392	5535794	It's created by a company called Enway, based out of Seoul.
5536654	5539696	And they previously, before this, developed Power Rangers-related games.
5539736	5541177	I don't know specifically which ones.
5541817	5545239	And there's a PC version of the game, too, on the Epic Games Store.
5545759	5549981	I mean, it has a really cheap DDR-looking mode, but I'm sure it plays...
5550981	5555843	probably like the Commodore 64 version of Summer Games played, which was a good game then in 1984.
5558124	5560405	But yeah, there's NFTs in the game.
5560746	5574792	Quote, on the game's website, olympicsgo.enway.com, join the excitement of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 with Enway's officially licensed Commemorative Paris 2024 NFT digital pin collection.
5575432	5577353	You can claim a legendary or epic pin.
5578113	5579774	I'm not reading the rest of it because we all know this is...
5582383	5587186	Be sure to have an ETH L2-based supported wallet to secure yours today.
5588207	5591049	Sorry, I left mine in my Skibidibi toilet.
5592470	5592890	Sorry.
5595893	5603758	You can tell that the IOC got conned a couple of years ago when everybody thought NFTs were going to be the fucking next big thing.
5605139	5605900	And here they are.
5607910	5609631	holding it out, being hung out to dry.
5610092	5611553	Because what's going to make more money?
5611833	5614655	This or Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games?
5616037	5620540	I think they're going to be crying very sad, sad, bitter tears.
5621021	5628427	TigerClaw in chat says those NFTs are going to fail and then the IOC will want to go back to Sega, who I hope asks for more money.
5629408	5629748	Yes.
5633311	5634672	Anyway, let's move on, DarkSakura.
5639018	5642340	We've had some news.
5642800	5644941	I'm not going to say much news.
5645822	5654447	But Humble Games has actually done one last release before they're doing a restructuring.
5656138	5683655	they were doing this they had released Bow Path of the Teal Lotus and they have a Patreon to support the game quote in these uncertain times the developer SquidShock said that they didn't fault any of the team's work but Humble's changes have meant this is a quote here we have missed out on critical post-launch support which may put our studio's future at risk
5684575	5686696	I went ahead and just bought the game at full price just now.
5687436	5691637	Not just now, but earlier today, so I can make sure that I got it.
5692457	5704361	But also within hours of Humble's post, they said that, and this is another quote, lost access to the pipeline of critical systems without warning.
5705401	5708642	They're still managing the game on Steam, and they were able to get a patch out.
5708722	5710543	They cannot say the same for consoles.
5711570	5715656	So, yeah, Humble's kind of screwing them over.
5717999	5720884	I mean, I don't think intentionally, but still.
5724358	5725419	They go on further on their post.
5725479	5727760	It says, despite this, our launch was not without its challenges.
5727820	5732202	Our publisher shutting down has meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support.
5732242	5732783	I just said that.
5733583	5738986	We want to make it crystal clear this is in no way the fault of the Humble Games team we worked with.
5739086	5742228	It's just a sad time in the industry and ultimately we understand.
5743269	5747331	And they are working on helping restore access to console versions.
5751612	5757175	This comes also after 36 Humble Games employees were laid off.
5760117	5761838	Like I said, I don't know.
5762478	5763579	I'm out of things to say.
5763719	5766440	I warned at the top of the show, the news isn't pleasant this week.
5766681	5768982	And I'm not going to lie, y'all.
5769142	5776966	It makes it really hard to have an enthusiast show when there really isn't anything to get enthusiastic about these days.
5777006	5778247	Or I should say few and far between.
5778971	5786753	I'm wondering where Humble is losing money as a predominantly charitable... Weren't they originally just a charitable company?
5787453	5793594	Yeah, they were purchased by IGN, but it's not Humble Bundle, it's Humble Games that shut down their publishing arm.
5795074	5802636	Yeah, I mean, but even so, I'm wondering how much actual financial support that aspect of it gets.
5802656	5803416	Yeah.
5805001	5808883	I'd really, that's what I kind of want to reserve a little bit of judgment for.
5809543	5818108	But at the same time, it seemed like this also might have been something that might have been trying to fight against.
5818128	5823771	Because they were saying, one of their representatives had said that they were just restructuring but not shutting down.
5823811	5829113	But some of their former employees are saying that it might be the opposite, that it might actually be shutting down.
5829134	5829614	Yeah.
5831383	5835557	I mean, would you say that we are coming up on our next big crash?
5836513	5838514	Didn't I get into this about six months ago?
5839014	5845076	I feel like you're saying what I did say when we were talking about a lot of these layoffs.
5845397	5848258	Yeah, I said I feel like, yeah, this is a form.
5848338	5854300	It's not the same thing because I think I mentioned – I wish I remember what episode number that was because I'd love to go back and listen to it.
5854360	5859702	I don't love to listen to old episodes of this show oftentimes because we don't always get it right.
5860062	5862483	But that one I'd love to go back and listen to because –
5864574	5891994	I was talking about the crash of 84 and it's different this time because we're buoyed up by indie games and we still will always kind of have that but I do feel like there is a big bubble that is bursting that is very reminiscent of the crash of 84 in some ways and too many people thinking they can cash in a big dollar I mean maybe it's not Atari 2600 cartridges but it's $70 video games or games with battle passes out the wazoo that there's too many cooks in the kitchen and it's causing the bubble to burst
5892874	5894235	I think there's a little bit more to it.
5894275	5903959	We're also coming right out of the post-COVID shutdown where basically video games were what people had to do.
5904439	5908681	I mean, and especially for a lot of the online community-based games.
5908721	5912222	I mean, we saw... I mean, I know I've said this before.
5912262	5915424	I know it wasn't on purpose, but damn Animal Crossing came out at the right time.
5916584	5918625	You know, but now people...
5919978	5925942	are basically going out and I mean, pardon me for saying they're going out and touching their grass and breathing the air.
5926603	5927983	You know, they're doing things.
5928023	5929685	They're working not from home.
5929765	5933227	They're able, you know, we've built up more immunity.
5933267	5936909	We've got more people vaccinated, even though there are still idiots out there who won't do it.
5938671	5947857	But overall, we have people re-engaging with society in ways that don't involve something that would have you at home to do.
5948817	5949077	So,
5950098	5975575	I mean introverts like me we're like yeah more games please please please but not everyone's like that and I think it's coming along with that massive social change but I mean but that's not to say that there isn't a you know a more widespread economy issue going on because we're also I saw on the Verve not long ago that Intel laid off 15,000 people
5979850	5981330	Let me just double check that real quick.
5981551	5988732	While you're saying that, I just want to say I think another big contributor to this whole thing too is what we were just talking about in the previous story.
5989032	5997493	The industry getting suckered by these ridiculous ideas like NFT, crypto, and what that was going to do for the industry.
5997933	6005335	Companies are getting suckered by what that is going to do into a false bottom line that gamers as a whole have rightfully rejected.
6005675	6007755	And next on the chopping block is stolen...
6012618	6022784	I think they're gonna eventually start understanding that we are also a more aware society.
6024924	6049507	and whether or not you know they want to see us as being in our own little community bubbles we have our fingers out there and we see and most of you know we grow up with the technology and we're seeing also more I would say younger gamers also thinking in terms of where this works in the real world being more socially conscious with with what they're doing with their money and what they're spending it on.
6051311	6052852	But yeah, I found what I was looking at.
6052972	6060473	Intel is laying off 15,000 employees and is stopping, quote, non-essential work.
6063294	6066695	So they're also looking that there could be more layoffs than that.
6066755	6067795	They're reducing R&D.
6067815	6073596	So yeah, so basically a lot of tech companies are cutting out some of their innovation too.
6073816	6075637	But I think that...
6076986	6080007	I'm going to switch gears for just a second.
6081687	6092851	I think that these companies, the people who are making the decisions about them, don't understand the technology that they're making the decision about.
6094935	6124032	like boardroom CEO says oh NFTs are the big thing I see the theory of this let's put it into practice without having any real world evidence of how it's actually going to work or how how people feel about it you know they're just like oh this is new it innovates it sets us apart let's do it when in reality it sets you apart in the wrong way it it sets one apart the way that um
6125402	6131346	Having a highly contagious illness sets you apart from society.
6131487	6134909	You got to stay locked up at home because no one wants to get sick either.
6135129	6137071	They don't want that happening to them.
6139352	6146998	So I really think, or I think that maybe somebody on the floor has a good idea and it might involve one of those technologies.
6147098	6153283	And when they explain this to the non-tech oriented person who deals only with money and the company,
6154620	6162832	At the same time, they're not going to really understand it and just say, oh, this can make money instead of, oh, we need to put all this work in it to implement it.
6164569	6165290	You're back, Loki.
6165550	6166090	We got you.
6166350	6169873	Yeah, internet hiccup and then Discord's like, I'm confused.
6170093	6171054	No, yeah, you're good.
6171674	6172254	Sorry, DarkSakura.
6173455	6174996	Well, you heard what I had to say.
6175096	6175317	I did.
6175917	6190767	And I did want to read this comment from SSJ100Mad as well that says, I think where it landed was that this crash will be more like a cooling where we would say fewer and fewer AAA games because the cost to make those games is so high and that we'll see more remakes in between those releases.
6191227	6191468	You know,
6192248	6194290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6210009	6210549	and so on.
6240429	6267022	otherwise they tend to resist a lot of the big trends online fucking there's no friends leaderboard in Nintendo World Championships which is redonkulous but their resistance to things like NFTs, AI they're resisting a lot of this stuff within Nintendo and so it's going to be very I feel like the Switch 2 is going to come out at a very interesting time in gaming
6268143	6269904	or Nintendo could really run away with it.
6270425	6274327	If they have the right lineup that's solid.
6274427	6277429	I mean, I think that thing's going to be a hit almost no matter what.
6277890	6281472	But I mean, this could be a real record breaker.
6282133	6282513	We'll see.
6282693	6282993	We'll see.
6284834	6285855	All right, moving on.
6286375	6288357	Let's get to our next story, Loki.
6288677	6291519	We haven't talked about Microsoft a lot tonight.
6291599	6292640	So sure, let's talk about them.
6293376	6300380	Yeah, so Microsoft and Activision are creating a brand new Splinter Studio.
6300400	6303441	It's going to focus on AA development.
6303461	6312406	I guess when they were talking about all those smaller indie games that are successful that they then laid off studios for, they're now creating a studio to make those games.
6313126	6313927	You know, that makes sense.
6315448	6330438	So, yeah, apparently, according to sources reported by Windows Central, indicate that Microsoft and Activision have approved the creation of a new team with its Blizzard subsidiary comprised mostly of employees from King.
6332299	6341826	And they're told that Microsoft and Activision's new team within Blizzard is tasked to work on AA smaller games based on existing franchises within the Blizzard universes.
6342888	6356312	Given that King is focused on mobile games, it's possible that these will be mobile games aimed to support the Xbox mobile gaming store on iOS and Android that's supposed to be upcoming.
6357572	6362594	But not necessarily certain that they'll be specifically mobile.
6362894	6365775	It could be expanded to other things other than mobile as well.
6367011	6390849	so interesting i guess um i don't think this is gonna be as significant as like say another uh hi-fi rush or something like that because it's we're talking sounds like smaller projects but yeah it's disappointing to see them kind of exchange good studios for i mean this is probably a decent studio but the projects sound less uh exciting
6395003	6397404	Yeah, I'll be interested to see what they kind of come up with.
6397444	6399966	But it is kind of what you said there at the beginning, Loki.
6399986	6401967	It's a little weird to see them creating a new studio.
6402187	6406790	And I understand there's, you know, with the mobile and everything, it's different sort of things at play.
6406810	6409151	But the optics of that are just so weird, right?
6409411	6414534	Yeah, it feels like stuff that, like... I'd rather they do this than close a different studio, I guess.
6414554	6415114	I mean, yeah.
6415254	6419157	Yeah, but... Like Fallout Shelter or something like that, you know?
6420217	6422899	Something like that would be pretty cool, but... Eh.
6423803	6450093	they already they did do a Warcraft mobile game recently um and I wasn't very into it Warcraft Rumble I think it's called I wasn't into it it feels very dated it felt like a cell phone game that would have come out it was like I think it was like a tower defense game and I was like this feels like something would come out 10 years ago so talking about things that are behind the curve I just I wasn't really into it but I know people that are and there's nothing wrong with just because I don't like it doesn't mean you don't have to just wasn't my cup of tea
6451496	6452757	All right, moving on.
6452777	6454557	Nintendo World Championships.
6454597	6461241	I have been playing a little bit on my Switch, probably more than about any other game, because I do love a little dose of retro every now and then.
6462681	6478629	Very interesting scenario that's happened is that the top of the leaderboard for one of the recent challenges in Nintendo World Championships, and even though you can't see how your friends rank, you can see a recording of the top score.
6479429	6480389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6498837	6499657	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6524406	6535469	If you play Donkey Kong Classics, I think it's called, which was the first two games combined in one cartridge, you can go down the first ladder and you can beat the first board very quick.
6536949	6540970	If you try to do that in Nintendo World Championships, the game rewinds.
6541370	6541990	It triggers.
6542130	6549912	It goes, can't go that way, as it does in some of the other challenges when you try to go way too far off track, which is an interesting feature in and of itself.
6550672	6564768	um so you can't use that glitch but this one for every reason you can and I didn't know about this glitch before um so maybe this is the first time Nintendo uh learned about it too I'm not sure but that was an interesting thing to see
6566351	6571315	Also interesting when it comes to Nintendo World Championships is one of the names that's in the credits.
6571755	6577019	If you look at the credits for the game under Program Support, you see the name Tomohiro Kawase.
6577640	6583845	You might not recognize that name as much as you would some of the other names around Nintendo, but you should put some respect on that name because...
6584875	6585696	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6611614	6614116	and then of course the GBA Classic NES series.
6614296	6617399	So he got a shout out in Nintendo World Championships.
6617979	6625786	And it's been reported previously that this individual got a break with Nintendo after working on unofficial emulators.
6626967	6630990	So kind of interesting how he came a long way.
6631290	6632331	So very cool.
6633312	6637135	Anyway, speaking of classic games, we've got a segment to get to.
6637495	6638216	Let's roll the bumper.
6648965	6656313	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6656733	6659336	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6660017	6667304	But once a month here on the program in the year 2024, DarkSakura picks a canceled game to talk about.
6667665	6670528	So DarkSakura, what is the canceled game of the month?
6671684	6674366	The canceled game is StarCraft Ghost.
6675126	6682872	So it was a military science fiction stealth action video game that was to be published.
6683252	6684553	Sorry, it was developed by Blizzard.
6685114	6687315	It was supposed to be part of StarCraft.
6687415	6690197	It was announced on September 20th, 2002.
6691538	6696502	Developed by Nihilistic Software for GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 consoles.
6698395	6699636	There were a lot of delays.
6700877	6705580	There were development transferred.
6706581	6707281	There was stuff.
6707502	6708302	Okay, there was stuff.
6709323	6715308	So I'll go ahead and start with what the game is.
6716088	6725075	So you play a character named Nova, and instead of this being a real-time strategy like the previous, like the first StarCraft, this is a...
6726136	6726977	Kind of Metal Gear-ish.
6727037	6728538	It's stealth tactical action.
6730200	6731261	You play as Nova.
6731341	6737246	You have a cloaking device that allows you to be concealed, but some characters can find you.
6737827	6743873	You also have thermal imaging goggles and EMPs and different types of guns to shoot at people.
6745654	6749978	So, I mean, it was a lot of just, you know...
6751079	6751919	Adventure-y stuff.
6752199	6763603	Nova has a lot of athletic abilities, ziplining and hanging from pipes, and also psionic powers.
6764784	6765944	Because she's a ghost agent.
6766864	6771126	It had a lot of vehicles that were in StarCraft and StarCraft Brood War.
6773807	6775968	Some were support, some you could use yourself.
6776468	6778428	There's also a multiplayer mode.
6780445	6800628	that uh you have like a personal view of some of the RTS strategies uh from the earlier games there was Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill stuff like that um an invasion mode where two teams are fighting for control of mineral resources so um
6802441	6803102	and so on.
6829546	6835032	So let's get a little bit more into the development and the cancellation.
6836173	6843360	So they had a lot of positive reaction from the press when they...
6845411	6869426	made the announcement for it it was supposed to be out in late 2003 but there were delays and as of third quarter 2004 Nihilistic stopped working on it and they had completed what they had been contract for but in the game would still be delivered on time and then they started working Blizzard that is started working with Swing and Ape Studios and then bought the company also in May 2005 and
6871387	6873169	but Ghost was delayed again.
6873989	6887500	At E3 2005, Ghost was officially re-announced but the GameCube version was cancelled because of a lack of online support and then it was delayed again until 2006.
6887920	6893504	There was a booth for it at E3 that year.
6896146	6896927	But yeah, they
6898124	6903910	They kept postponing it until they were going to put it on newer consoles.
6905071	6909816	And then they suspended the development again.
6910837	6914421	And that's when the novel came out a few months later in November 2006.
6916523	6938197	so Blizzard Cinematics team that worked on Starcraft's cutscenes did cutscenes for Ghost's single player campaign and then they went from a team of 6 to 25 and used newer hardware newer stuff that were much higher quality and they had released a trailer in August 2005 and
6941099	6951705	Now, Nova, who is the protagonist of this game, also shows up in a campaign mission for StarCraft II, Wings of Liberty, where you can side with her or fight against her.
6951885	6957608	She's also in Heart of the Swarm and then her own campaign in StarCraft II, Nova Covert Ops.
6960410	6966595	So she's been certainly going on through the StarCraft universe.
6966615	6971339	She's established now, but we're still not seeing the games.
6971899	6982748	So at the DICE Summit in 2008, in the presentation, they had listed games canceled by Blizzard and it did not include Ghosts.
6984485	7012964	but their co-founder said that the title had never been technically cancelled it just wasn't their focus and they were putting a lot of that more on the success of World of Warcraft and working on StarCraft 2 was taking their resources however despite all that everyone was like yeah this is vaporware we ain't having it and in fact the game ranked 5th in 2005's Wired News Annual Vaporware Awards
7014285	7022351	On September 23rd, 2014, Polygon interviewed Blizzard about Titan.
7023572	7027515	And at that time, they confirmed that StarCraft Ghost was cancelled.
7028396	7037103	And with a quote, it was hard when we cancelled Warcraft Adventures, it was hard when we cancelled StarCraft Ghost, but it has always resulted in better quality work.
7039765	7040345	Sorry, Jamie.
7040465	7048729	I just want to point out a strong irony about that comment because Titan ultimately got canceled too, but then, of course, kind of sort of turned into Recycle This Overwatch.
7048789	7049869	I think that's very interesting.
7053751	7060454	In 2016, in a Polygon article, they basically were...
7061778	7066864	Just thinking they could put it out on a different console or keep doing better and better to it, but then, wow.
7068005	7071429	So, this takes us to more modern times in 2020.
7073490	7073810	January 2020.
7074111	7085821	There were videos from the Xbox version appearing online and lots of videos showing different missions, gameplay, different areas.
7086522	7093929	Those all were uploaded and there was a rumor of the Xbox development version game files being linked.
7095270	7095550	So
7097572	7112112	there are different journalists that did verify the legitimacy of this code that was disseminated online and there were infringement notices that went out but I mean basically people got them you know
7113553	7118956	They had a playable though unfinished game, as we're seeing now.
7119536	7127920	And also a version of Warcraft Adventures Lord of the Clans had been leaked earlier in September 2016.
7128760	7131642	And so with this, basically...
7135722	7159715	it's a game that looked like it could have been really great I might have even had some interest in playing this game it really looked that level of fun it had been on my radar for a hot minute but at this point all we have is this playable footage and videos online and that's really it R.I.P.
7160216	7162337	StarCraft Ghost you are now a ghost
7164025	7164726	Happy Halloween!
7164806	7166008	And I guess Nova lives on?
7179898	7208687	most other companies at this point probably would have pulled the plug and decommissioned Heroes of the Storm the way that Blizzard is kind of like not doing anything with it these days I will say to Blizzard's credit at least it's still going and the servers are still on and that's longer than most games you know in its similar state would hopefully it continues on at some point but yeah apparently I just learned that there is a Nova skin for Widowmaker in Overwatch there is yeah yeah yeah
7209414	7210054	which is pretty cool.
7211435	7215237	It is at least nice to see Blizzard sort of like, you know, tip the hat and nod.
7215697	7218779	I feel like StarCraft She's in another book too, I think.
7218819	7224682	Well, and I also feel like, you know, we've had Diablo 4, we have a new Warcraft expansion.
7225482	7231985	I feel like the words StarCraft 3 because Blizzard isn't allergic to the number 3 like some companies.
7232806	7236868	I feel like the word StarCraft 3 could happen from Blizzard
7237873	7239254	Maybe in the next couple of years.
7239294	7240034	Let's be realistic.
7240074	7241374	Blizzard takes some time to make games.
7241394	7245716	But I feel like StarCraft 3 would be like the next big thing on the horizon.
7246676	7254079	So, Bonds006 says, I played Heroes of the Storm all day today.
7254199	7254939	Nothing wrong with that.
7255039	7255760	It's a fun game.
7255800	7256540	It's a great game.
7257080	7262822	And I like to play classic and retro games too that aren't supported by the company so well anymore.
7263243	7263683	But that's...
7264403	7267585	I enjoyed Heroes of the Storm because it didn't just have PvP, it had PvE.
7281112	7281632	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7311603	7334783	I wonder if any of the ones that were on my list are things that people are curious about that would expect me to and I've got a few honorable mentions that I could do but I think I have my list pretty well set I'll send it to you and I'll see what you think alright
7336267	7337068	We have one.
7337108	7337328	Yes.
7359791	7365894	So Sony announced that they have a limited edition Astro Bot controller that's going to be coming out for the PlayStation 5.
7367154	7369495	$80 coming out on September 6th.
7370256	7371096	And it looks cute.
7371116	7375658	It's got the eyes on the touchpad itself, which it's confusing.
7375738	7379260	I don't think they're animated, but in the video they are animated.
7379380	7381100	So who knows?
7381241	7382881	But it's cute.
7382901	7383642	It looks like a robot.
7384742	7385502	If that's your thing.
7386623	7386723	Um...
7387867	7393231	and then of course we got news that Prison Architect 2 has been delayed indefinitely.
7393632	7411126	It's supposed to come out here very soon but I guess there's some stuff going on at Paradox Interactive that has delayed the game and essentially they have refunded the pre-orders so that's good at least that that happened but it is no longer coming out September 3rd.
7413608	7417451	They said they need more time to improve both the game's performance and its content.
7418348	7424292	Alright, snaps for not releasing a half-assed product and taking the time to get it right and refunding.
7424372	7426714	I guess, how often do you hear that headline?
7427134	7427874	Not very often.
7427894	7428655	That's not very often.
7429535	7429996	DarkSakura?
7431817	7434819	So, Nintendo is also feeling the burn.
7435379	7438301	We were saying things are going industry-wide, but their profits fell 55%.
7442004	7443605	People are saving up for the Switch, too.
7445971	7470222	but they also haven't had super big releases like you know how we had Tears of the Kingdom last year we haven't had like any big movies come out also to bolster that so it's stated that the Switch 2 or whatever it will be called would be released in early 2025 but you know again people are holding on yeah
7473150	7492804	I was actually talking to somebody very recently about the Nintendo Switch And somebody who's a big Nintendo fan and games a lot on the Nintendo Switch And even going like, even I'm getting exhausted, this other person Even I'm getting exhausted at how bad the Nintendo Switch runs newer games And how we keep losing features in games we shouldn't be losing features on Actually, you know what it was?
7492864	7497808	We were talking about the video game No Man's Sky Because we were talking about that a little bit and he actually told me As you do
7498589	7502616	As I do sometimes, I'm not just a client, I'm also the president.
7503798	7504198	Other way around.
7504218	7509848	Anyway, but my friend said, I'm actually afraid to get No Man's Sky on Switch.
7510228	7512052	I just know it's not going to run well.
7513632	7515373	Now, I have friends that have No Man's Sky on Switch.
7515393	7519056	I think, Dark, not to call you out, but Dark, don't you guys play it on Switch and I think it runs okay?
7519596	7524980	Because I think they down-res it so it runs on Switch better because it's a smaller resolution.
7525020	7527102	That's not necessarily a bad thing for that screen.
7527502	7531525	But the long story short, that system is showing its age.
7531685	7532926	It is not, and like, it's...
7534367	7536870	The game's technologies are getting further.
7537490	7544738	I think he was also complaining that he was playing Octopath Traveler 2 on Switch, and it's stuttering.
7544878	7545779	It's got problems.
7545819	7553066	It's like, okay, Octopath Traveler 2, even though it is a newer game, it's not exactly using new techniques in gaming animation.
7553247	7555789	That game should run on a PlayStation 3, shouldn't it?
7556370	7556710	So...
7557871	7560552	It's just interesting to hear that sort of perspective.
7560572	7566173	But I think even the most hardcore Nintendo fans are like, yeah, y'all, it's time.
7566933	7567293	It's time.
7567653	7568954	Okay, thank you in chat.
7568994	7569774	Mish in chat.
7569794	7573455	Hi, Mish says, it honestly doesn't run that bad on Switch.
7573955	7575435	And Dark Dispute says, yeah, it wasn't terrible.
7575475	7577576	So they did the resolution workaround to do that.
7578656	7578996	Thank you.
7579016	7582657	Red Entertainment with a much better quote saying, I'm not just an addict, I'm also a dealer.
7582977	7583337	There you go.
7584097	7590363	And then Ranmari in chat says, some devs just don't optimize well for their target platform.
7590783	7600171	You know, it isn't in our headlines tonight, but there was one developer out there who made a pretty open comment this week about, why would we bother with the Xbox version?
7600211	7602313	No one's playing on Xbox.
7602513	7604395	It was a Japanese developer who said it, of course.
7605236	7608499	But basically it was like, why are we bothering optimizing for Xbox?
7608599	7609660	Nobody's playing on Xbox.
7609720	7609800	Yeah.
7616877	7622161	I really worry about how Pokemon Legends ZA is going to run on the Switch.
7622682	7626425	Yeah, valid AF for that game.
7626805	7632970	Like, if that game comes out before a Switch successor, I have concerns.
7634511	7635072	Period.
7636960	7644722	BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I mean, all you have to do is, in Unity, go to File, Compile As, Switch, and boom!
7645062	7645982	You have your Switch port.
7646162	7646902	It's that easy.
7647683	7648223	Right, Loki?
7648503	7650323	We can get a Pixel Poops 2 on Switch, right?
7650343	7657525	Just open it up in Unity, turn up the graphics on level 3, and then do File, Save As, Switch, right?
7657845	7660345	I mean, sort of.
7660385	7668287	You need to get a wrapper that's an NES emulator that they have used for other Nesmicry games, so it is possible.
7668427	7669807	You make it sound too hard.
7673468	7674848	Rob.
7674948	7675208	What?
7677169	7677429	What?
7678629	7679209	You said hard.
7684030	7684570	Moving on.
7686914	7687695	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7708968	7710149	Do we have to?
7710249	7713651	We saw one on the road on the way to the convention last week.
7714792	7715753	What did you throw at it?
7715893	7718655	In your imagination because you would never actually do that.
7719956	7721998	Anyway, here's why I want to bring it up.
7722598	7731825	So there's a new DLC pack in Fortnite called the Summer Road Trip Bundle and you get to drive a Tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite, Rocket League, blah blah blah.
7732065	7735848	But, just like the real thing, it was glitched.
7736880	7737722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7749229	7753690	which if you're using the Cybertruck in Fortnite, you kind of deserve to be rendered completely useless.
7754110	7765512	I'm actually using this whole story to bring up this kind of side thing I've actually heard that's really funny, which apparently there are lots of Fortnite people that are banding together to create this unofficial, unspoken word.
7766572	7770973	All of the people in the game, all 100 people in the game are in a truce.
7770993	7774334	Well, I should say all 99 people in the game are in a truce.
7775174	7778795	If you see somebody with a Cybertruck, they get it first.
7780481	7780721	Yeah.
7780741	7780861	Yeah.
7807228	7811011	Oh no, don't get addicted to the cosmetics in that game, Jamie.
7811311	7813533	You'll have to take out another mortgage.
7814954	7815474	I know.
7816635	7818156	I have the ones I want.
7818236	7820037	I have the Dragon Ariana Grande.
7820497	7823299	I think this is important aside from the Fortnite stuff.
7823319	7824861	So the LEGO Fortnite stuff is pretty cool.
7824941	7826462	Oh yeah, yeah.
7826542	7829644	And the Cybertruck isn't in that, which already makes it better.
7830444	7833647	LEGO Fortnite LEGO sets coming out in October.
7834287	7836249	But, you know, it's in Target now.
7837165	7844678	The Animal Crossing LEGO sets Do you know what my husband sent me a picture of from Costco which sometimes dabbles in the LEGO stuff?
7844898	7848104	Animal Crossing I don't know if I want
7850546	7851887	I have so much stuff already.
7852348	7855190	Because you know Alan is so fucking funny.
7855250	7858773	I'm just gonna show you this on my little... Actually, I can do this.
7858853	7859693	You're cute!
7859773	7861835	I'm gonna do this shot real quick so you can see it.
7862175	7863136	He sent me this thing.
7863176	7865438	He sent me the Animal Crossing Legos, right?
7865458	7870562	There's the set at Costco with the caption... Yeah, with the caption, I hate it here.
7873364	7874525	I need that.
7875646	7877107	Oh my god, they're expensive.
7877127	7879910	Some of the sets, like the camping set is 80 bucks.
7881653	7882833	The KK Concert one.
7883213	7886654	And then there's one of Nook's Cranny and Rosie's.
7887754	7889695	Oh my gosh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat.
7890095	7892775	I sold a pinball machine for V-Bucks.
7894775	7895496	Not that.
7895516	7897136	Okay.
7897656	7899716	I'm sending Dan now because, you know.
7900817	7900997	What?
7901357	7901677	Reason.
7901897	7902637	What, to Costco?
7904057	7905337	No, of the Amazon link.
7905638	7906318	Oh, okay, okay.
7907578	7907878	All right.
7909642	7910162	Let's move on.
7910222	7913485	Let's travel around the world and check out some releases coming to you soon.
7913865	7914966	Loki, let's start in the U.S.
7915666	7917087	Quite a few things coming out, actually.
7917628	7923312	So we have Bleak Faith Forsaken on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
7924412	7928835	Signy All Guns Blazing on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
7929616	7936061	Eden Genesis on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
7938591	7955183	Pepper Grinder on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series Volgar the Viking 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox One Creatures of Ava on PC and Xbox Series
7961960	7968905	CatQuest 3 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
7969205	7970286	Honestly, congrats.
7970906	7972407	They're releasing a third game.
7972447	7972847	That's great.
7973788	7974588	Yep.
7975229	7980272	Deathbound on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
7981613	7984275	We've got... Let's see.
7985616	7989518	Um... Komajo Romilia...
7990492	8016690	Scarlet Symphony on PlayStation 5 Moonless Moon, that doesn't make any sense, but okay, on PC and Mac Princess Maker 2 Regeneration on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 Review Starlight Eldorado on PC and Nintendo Switch SteamWorld Heist 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series
8018482	8019543	Oh, this is a title.
8020204	8025949	That time I got reincarnated as a Slime Isekai Chronicles.
8026109	8027270	That game has come out before.
8027531	8029392	Or like another version of it.
8029452	8032035	It's based on a manga?
8033307	8034048	I would imagine.
8034608	8037551	Yeah, I don't think it's an original to video games IP.
8038491	8043395	It's PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
8044296	8045477	Ranma says it's an anime.
8046398	8049460	And this is also one that's a thing, I guess.
8049740	8055184	Zombie Police, Christmas Dancing with Police Zombies on PC and Mac.
8055705	8058347	First off, why is this coming out in August?
8058607	8060489	ACAB includes Zombie Police.
8062866	8066208	and then The Crush House on PC.
8066588	8067369	That one looks pretty good.
8069971	8070291	All right.
8070711	8073233	Have you seen the one that's the new game?
8073273	8076395	Was it Date Anything or Date Everything?
8077076	8077416	Yes.
8080759	8082320	I love these dating games.
8082340	8083621	They're getting crazier and crazier.
8084326	8086027	Yeah, I linked that one.
8086348	8091592	Well, Fixie told me about that one, and I linked it to Nick, and I think everyone's reaction was the same, like, what?
8092132	8092373	What?
8094554	8096516	Alright, let's move on.
8096916	8098518	Let's travel to Japan, get in the car.
8099498	8099699	So...
8100919	8102881	On August 8th, we actually have a lot of releases.
8102921	8104482	This is all the Nintendo Switch.
8104642	8104962	You ready?
8105543	8107544	Review Starlight, which Loki mentioned.
8108244	8112868	Hanaimo, Kare, Tu, and Bloom comes out in a regular and special edition.
8113388	8116830	Some Some Convenience Store comes out in a regular and limited edition.
8117971	8122554	Rashomon of Shinjuku comes out in a regular and, you guessed it, special edition.
8123095	8124696	Lost Epic is also out.
8125256	8125796	Knights of Valor
8153221	8155484	Ooh, I thought that word is problematic.
8157887	8165556	I don't know of a word that they would have used 20 years ago that begins with O to describe Asian folks.
8168400	8170643	Agatha Christie's, yeah, I don't know.
8170663	8170743	Oh!
8172062	8175423	Well, I mean, if it's coming from, and I get the Christie novel, I think it's okay.
8175563	8176323	Well, no, it's not.
8176463	8176783	It's not.
8176823	8179924	But I'm just trying to think of where, you know, I've heard that word used in pop culture.
8179944	8184825	But anyway, that legend is coming out in that collection.
8185025	8189686	Marshall Masters, Demon Front, and The Gladiator are all coming out.
8190407	8195448	I wondered why it was a bad word when the other opposite is Occidental.
8197296	8198116	I don't know.
8198296	8202457	I just, you know, if somebody tells me they don't like it, I do my best to adjust, I guess.
8202537	8202817	All right.
8203998	8210339	On the PlayStation 5, we have Princess Maker 2 Regeneration, as well as Lost Epic.
8211039	8215100	And that time I got reincarnated as a slime is all coming out in Japan.
8215420	8217541	So very similar sorts of things.
8217581	8224122	But I should also point out the PlayStation VR 2 adapter for PC also gets a Japanese release this week, which is pretty cool.
8224723	8224903	So.
8226343	8226603	All right.
8228157	8237265	Okay, so in Europe, on the 6th for PlayStation and Xbox is Cygni, All Guns Blazing.
8237665	8240127	And I kind of like the name of that because it makes me think of swans.
8240607	8241228	Like Cygnus.
8243230	8247233	On the 8th for Switch and PlayStation, we have Cat Quest 3.
8248033	8248614	And that's it.
8249094	8249575	Ta-da!
8250871	8257934	All right, we have just a few headlines for you, and then we'll get to our email and whatever else might be in the listener roundtable tonight.
8258414	8259695	So, Loki, let's start with you.
8261295	8270399	Yes, the creator of Resident Evil, Shinji Mikami, wants Suda51 to work on a new Killer7 game.
8272199	8273380	Like a new Killer7 game.
8275101	8275701	Game was weird.
8277108	8278349	If you're in, if you're lucky.
8305356	8306337	Yeah, the multiverse there.
8306377	8307398	Yeah, we'll see that.
8308899	8310060	Yeah, I mean, cool.
8313322	8317426	But, you know, yeah, I don't know.
8317686	8322910	He says the complete edition which came out for Killer7 was kind of lame.
8323710	8334539	And they said Suda51 disagreed, saying that the current version of Killer7 doesn't really speak, but was originally planned to have lots of dialogue.
8336387	8338688	Yeah, I'm not too familiar with the complete edition.
8339068	8341929	Like I said, I played this originally when it came out on the PlayStation 2.
8346910	8347230	Yeah.
8349211	8349851	I mean, cool.
8350151	8351672	Yeah, I hope they make another game.
8351952	8355733	I would say, though, since the original came out, was it 2005?
8356253	8357113	Probably not gonna happen.
8359154	8359434	All right.
8360868	8365553	Well, moving on here to the final story we have officially on the show world tonight.
8366074	8368336	Finally, some fucking good news.
8369097	8370739	At least I think this is good news.
8370799	8372260	Not everybody's going to... You would, right?
8372300	8377866	Some people may actually see this as bad news because they are about to lose a lot of evenings and weekends.
8378527	8382131	And that is the Sid Meier's Civilization VII...
8383072	8383993	Gameplay Showcase.
8384033	8384433	Remember that?
8384473	8386996	They actually announced Civ 7 but they didn't show any gameplay yet.
8387516	8394783	They will be showing gameplay on August 20th at 1 30 p.m and it has over 20 minutes of gameplay details.
8395084	8398007	I guess that means the game is probably due this holiday season.
8398087	8406555	It's got to be because right after that they're also going to be from August 21st to 25th if you are at gamescom.com
8407115	8408397	You can play, Civilization.
8408437	8409819	Well, they don't say play.
8409859	8413322	They just say stop by the Civ 7 booth located in Hall 6.
8413843	8417547	So I don't want to misspeak, but they'll be showing something there.
8418368	8420070	And then August 31st at PAX...
8421792	8426578	There will be a dev panel where they will share new insights and behind the scenes anecdotes.
8427058	8427779	So that's pretty cool.
8427799	8429561	And you can actually watch that live as well.
8429581	8435468	So maybe, I don't know, maybe it doesn't hit this year, but Civ 7 appears to be on the horizon pretty soon.
8435588	8436630	And that is pretty cool.
8436950	8441135	And I really do hope Christopher Tin did the theme again this time because he did the theme for...
8442216	8447100	Civ 4, which, you know, I think everybody knows Baba Yetu at this point because that got nominated for the Grammy and all that stuff.
8447480	8449181	And then he did the theme for 6, too.
8449221	8451723	He didn't do 5, but he did 6, which was really good, too.
8451783	8453464	It wasn't really talked about enough.
8453524	8456386	It's actually a really lovely song from Civ 6.
8456926	8459769	And so I really hope he does the Civ 7 theme as well.
8459929	8460069	So...
8461392	8462173	By the way, Rob.
8462514	8462694	What?
8463034	8463795	To take a step back.
8464115	8469761	I did because I'm that person that does my own research when I want to make sure I am not abusing any privilege.
8469882	8470082	Sure.
8470622	8474707	And apparently not everyone feels that it is, but enough people feel that it is offensive.
8475027	8475367	Thank you.
8475788	8478811	I just, I remember that lady- As a title, it's one thing.
8479232	8481714	Using it as a term to describe somebody is a different thing.
8481834	8482075	Okay.
8482595	8510352	and maybe that's where I'm mixing it up in my head because I know Lady Gaga got a lot of crap for using a variation of that word in one of her songs Born This Way and she actually changed it when she sings it live now so she changed the lyrics I know people who flat out refer to themselves that way so that's why I always want to make sure it's like me with people who are autistic some people prefer person first language and say person with autism which I don't like at all, don't use that around me but
8511172	8514073	You gotta talk to the person, use whatever they respect using.
8516054	8521215	Okay, so let's move on and get to the listener roundtable and I'll just jump right to the emails.
8521295	8528898	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com where DarkSakura said she climbed into the mailbag and found one lone email to dust off and read.
8529818	8531199	This came from Net Zero.
8531879	8533120	Hello, OLR crew.
8533240	8533981	I love the show.
8534161	8537844	Do you think AI will help speed up game development to yearly releases?
8538384	8542707	Do you think the Switch 2 will end up launching without a big lineup of games?
8544028	8544708	That's all the email.
8545128	8550032	I will go ahead and start off by saying it depends on what you mean by AI.
8550112	8551673	If it's generative AI, fuck it.
8551933	8552994	We don't want that in our game.
8553966	8564916	If it's using AI tools and assistance and having in-game AI for part of the program of the game and what makes the gameplay go, then...
8566559	8570483	I'm okay with internal generative AI.
8570523	8570823	Yeah.
8570843	8571644	Yeah.
8589102	8617732	or instead of generative AI I think they're also referring to AI tools like I will use some of the ones in Pixelmator like especially like a my brain is smart resolution I will use that for a few projects if I have to blow up an image and don't have anything else to go with AI coding tools I mean Bobby says AI coding tools are still generative AI I'm looking at
8619315	8628622	Production level of assets versus... That's a semantic thing for right now in the context of how I'm referring to it.
8629142	8640431	Things like voice actors and characters and if it's pulling from a non-in-company generated source, then I'm against it.
8640831	8645535	If it is programmed by people, provided by people, paid content...
8646275	8650377	to go into the database of those things, then yes, I'm cool with that.
8651418	8654619	And I think that that's the point of what assistive AI is meant for.
8655740	8661063	I'm going to refer to them in those two different contexts for clarity.
8661823	8665345	And as far as a switch to launching without a big lineup of games, I don't know.
8666445	8668687	They're going to have to have something come out for it.
8669287	8673270	I'll give you – well, first off, I don't think I've heard this emailer before, so thank you for emailing in.
8673310	8674051	It's always nice to hear.
8674171	8676993	We love to hear from our regulars, but we love to hear from new people too.
8677493	8678714	So thank you for sending a message.
8679175	8688741	I will actually say – because I think also the question about AI was is it going to – because I think basically yearly releases, I get the hint, is it going to cut down the production time of games?
8689622	8714281	I don't think so but I think what it will do is as systems get what you know PlayStation 6 is on the horizon and someday in our lives of PlayStation 7 I think those sorts of tools that Jamie's talking about will help us get there but I don't think it reduces the cycle all the way down to a year I think it's still gonna but it also kind of depends on the game you know I
8715154	8728452	I think that the people who aren't in the thick of the technology thinks it's going to help but really I don't think it is and on top of that too as you were dealing with better graphic capability I want to say um
8730623	8736849	These tools are only just going to help facilitate, I think, harder work if they do pan out the way people think that they do.
8737409	8748319	Because there's going to have to be that much more artistry put into the work that goes out, more assets to be designed, things like that.
8748619	8752083	So that's my take on that, is that it probably wouldn't...
8753200	8754120	Make it any better.
8754240	8756121	I think crunch time is always going to exist.
8756741	8769145	But I think that people are going to try to put more pressure on development and programmers to produce because they think that AI assistant tools are going to lighten their load.
8769805	8772326	And I think it's going to cause more problems than it helps.
8772826	8774587	Which is why we hope the unions get set up.
8775107	8782852	Anyway, but to the emailer's question too, I just kind of want to point out, it also really depends on the scale of game you're talking about, right?
8782892	8787034	Because there's a lot of indie games and indie developers who may not have this problem.
8787114	8787594	Some do.
8787674	8790936	I mean, it just depends on how much time they can allocate to their game making.
8791696	8794178	But I think of like Five Nights at Freddy's.
8794218	8796599	Those games were coming out every year for a while.
8796619	8797580	They got all the way up to what?
8797640	8798180	Like five?
8798200	8798580	Yeah.
8798600	8798720	Yeah.
8800361	8802422	There's still new ones coming out, but they're kind of different.
8802562	8804883	I'm talking about the core series.
8804963	8806143	Those were coming out every year.
8806423	8808704	It also just kind of depends on the scope of the game itself.
8809824	8810685	Something to think about, too.
8811465	8813185	As far as the Switch question...
8816251	8828563	I think these delays are to help us have a strong lineup, but I think you can fully expect that the lineup at the beginning are going to be things that you already know about that is also playable on Switch.
8829203	8833547	As I was mentioning earlier in the show, great example, Pokemon Legends ZA.
8834568	8836510	That needs to be on the Switch successor.
8836830	8837471	Needs to be.
8837771	8839432	But it will probably also be a Switch game.
8839873	8852404	And it should be somewhere in that roadmap of, you know, what does the Switch... And this is something when the Switch originally released it very well too, is that it wasn't just the games that came out with day one, but what did the games look like for 12 months?
8853965	8854065	3DS 3DS
8869124	8897795	do y'all remember they actually had to do the ambassador downloads y'all remember that to the early adopters because there was such a drought now they turned it around and the 3DS became you know one of the top selling systems ever they did turn it around but I think Nintendo has a different strategy now than they did 10 years ago so I would expect that you're gonna see a strong 12 month pipeline of games and some of that may rely on indies and um um
8899676	8924603	I think there's a reason that trailer was succinct that we saw I think they're purposely holding some of it back because when you see it you're going to go the Switch can't do that but the Switch 2 can so we'll see anyway thanks so much for the email appreciate it

8950440	8975294	I don't see anybody in the green room how dare let me check in though with Loki real quick though to see if there's any last minute stories I don't want to wrap up just yet there are not I looked high and low it's been a slow summer it's interesting but it's an April summer leaving me here on my own I only have one story that I could think of but I'd rather not because it's not good news oh no
8976405	8977526	It's still bad news.
8977846	8982948	A certain controversial doctor is back on YouTube again.
8983048	8983289	Nope.
8983769	8986290	I don't give a... Tonight is the night.
8989492	8991433	He... No.

8992593	8993434	No.
8994054	9003139	I appreciate you trying to keep us all in the loop, but that is somebody who needs to... Again, we need to stop making people like that famous.
9005848	9006589	But I understand.
9006629	9007709	A lot of people do talk about it.
9007729	9010411	I'm not saying it, but I'm just like, no, I don't want to talk about it.
9011252	9011512	All right.
9013694	9019798	Anyway, unless the rest of that story, let me ask the yes or no question, Loki.
9020159	9026663	Is the rest of that story came back to YouTube to announce they are permanently retiring and deleting their channel in 30 days?
9027504	9027684	Nope.
9027744	9028445	Okay, then I don't care.
9028925	9029265	All right.
9030426	9031187	Moving on.
9032012	9033835	I... I can't.
9034036	9035738	Tonight has been just a sad night.
9035939	9041467	I feel like... It is for us being kind of... And our news hasn't been great for the past month.
9041667	9044131	Like, I'm like, give me some good news.
9044532	9046475	At least I got a No Man's Sky patch.
9047762	9068594	tell me something good anyway I'm ready to just disconnect from the reality and live in unreality for a while so DarkSakura, I know you need a moment to set up tonight so I'm going to go ahead and let you wrap up before we do all the official outros so DarkSakura, would you like to give us your final thought tonight?
9070656	9074698	fuck honestly a mood
9075868	9076389	Totally Mood.
9076730	9076990	Alright.

9078173	9078614	See y'all soon.
9078834	9079335	See you next time.
9080490	9085931	Before I get to Loki and myself and our final thoughts, I want to say as always, thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
9085991	9088612	If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show, help us spread the word.
9089232	9093413	Tell somebody about the show because word of mouth goes a very, very long way.
9093733	9095013	You know what else helps an awful lot?
9095093	9101354	A nice five-star review on iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, thumbs up or whatever, wherever it is you found this show.
9102134	9103374	We really, really appreciate it.
9103414	9105575	So thank you so much for all of that support.
9106035	9107175	I appreciate you all with that.
9107375	9112917	And we will be back next week, God willing, to do this all again.
9113017	9119458	So we should be able to get through most of August until we get to DragonCon, which, yes, as Bobby Blackwolf is saying in chat, is going to be an awesome year.
9119618	9122939	I can't wait to talk more about it in a few weeks here on the show.
9123759	9127800	But until then, Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
9130521	9132641	Yeah, just, I don't know.
9133102	9134882	Keep working on content.
9137553	9138213	Watch my stuff.
9138293	9138994	Go subscribe.
9139114	9140974	I lost 11 subscribers in the last month.
9142435	9143896	Go subscribe to Loki's channel.
9144796	9146116	Negative growth got 11.
9147197	9151018	Same thing was happening on my Twitch channel, but I have not been streaming regularly.
9152379	9155720	I try, but dang, it's hard to keep regular.
9155780	9157141	I will say this.
9157301	9160142	I'm just going to throw this out there and see how chat reacts.
9161027	9167951	I'm considering a possible pivot to YouTube, and that's nothing anti-Twitch.
9168271	9169412	I really enjoy Twitch.
9169532	9170012	I like it.
9170593	9176436	I feel like YouTube, and as much as I've had my issues with YouTube over the years, there's issues with everything.
9178817	9189644	I'm thinking about I can create content a little more on my schedule, where if I want to do something in the middle of the night or something a little different time, I kind of can do it.
9190583	9216368	so yeah QuestBuster says do it or try it for a bit to see how it shakes out but then there's also trying to like balance that with also like I would like to make sure VOG has a YouTube presence and all of that and make sure there's a balance there appropriately and what is for me and what is for VOG and all that good stuff so it's something I've been stewing on lately anyway I'm not like leaving Twitch or anything and I'll probably stream this week but just know it's something that's I'm kind of marinating on in the back of my mind so
9217108	9221910	Philof9 in chat says you should stream on Martha Stewart's gaming website does she have one?
9222491	9237878	cause I would actually if that was a thing I fucking love Martha Stewart because if Martha Stewart has a gaming website you know who else is on that website is Snoop Dogg, Uncle Snoop I would absolutely stream on that website send me the link alright anyway
9239537	9240758	That's going to do it, everybody.
9241278	9242799	Thank you so much for listening.
9242919	9245080	Oh, final thought, right?
9245421	9246261	I got yours.
9246882	9249163	My final thought would be pole vaulting.
9249603	9250504	Have a good night, everybody.
9250544	9252845	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
