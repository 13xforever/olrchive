00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:17,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

2
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:41,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet.

4
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:45,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:03,670
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined by my awesome co-hosts and yes, as Jason said in the intro there,

7
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason in person Jason in person

8
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:34,881
[SPEAKER_04]: But you get to watch all of us creepily as we tape live over at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, where Orange Lounge Radio is broadcast every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

9
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:36,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, we are all back together.

10
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:43,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels really good because I feel like it's been literally a month since we've all been here, but there's, you know...

11
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,187
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,932
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so good.

13
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:14,914
[SPEAKER_06]: It really, it was so good.

14
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,116
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the jokes I wanted were there.

15
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:19,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything.

16
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to spoil a certain cameo, even though I think it's been spoiled for some people.

17
00:02:26,823 --> 00:02:28,845
[SPEAKER_07]: The soundtrack is really, really great.

18
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:29,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But I...

19
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:49,280
[SPEAKER_07]: and for me being like a Marvel multiverse comic person there were so many things my favorite although and this is even from the trailer like my favorite little snuff like like snub is what I'm saying was uh Liefeld's Easy Feet

20
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Deadpool, Deadpool, Deadpool

21
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:18,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, except he's actually doing it with his hands.

22
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:19,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he is.

23
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:28,517
[SPEAKER_07]: You should, I'm going to have to just, there's like a website dedicated to just how off his art is, but it is iconic.

24
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:34,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It is iconic, and he gave us Deadpool straight out of New Mutants back in the day.

25
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,241
[SPEAKER_07]: So many nods on there for actual comic book readers, too.

26
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:40,765
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:22,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never noticed just how many pride flags are of varying differences like obviously I see an ace flag and I'm sure there's some other stuff in there I can't really see you have a ton of pride flags kind of all on the bookshelf behind you no it's great I love it of course I keep acquiring them and then I just shove them in my bookshelf yes you have a choir of pride flags behind you but I the two that are in the back I have my love is loved one that I made

28
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:49,723
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the one underneath that it's supposed to be the pride colors but I actually did the ace flag and the bi flag and some of the stuff for parafemale okay so it's it's it's my uh mythicals okay my mythicals pride flag I I I love getting to peek in your office and all that fun little stuff and I really should get to put stuff up on on the internet

29
00:04:50,216 --> 00:05:09,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep honking, I'm also a goose who is pretending to be human Fear not, comrade, our day will come This is a bumper sticker she's holding up on camera It is, I'm going to put a magnet backing on it Because I have the one that says thoughts and prayers But it's crossed out and it says legislation and reform Mm-hmm

30
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:15,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like to put stickers on my car, but I do magnets.

31
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:19,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I have magnet backing that I'm going to put that on and then put it on my car.

32
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:27,134
[SPEAKER_07]: If I need to trade in the Doom thing, at the very least, it's not going to have all the stuff all over it.

33
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:35,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's also say hello to and welcome back to the show because I really feel like it's been about a month with all the shows we've had to cancel, unfortunately.

34
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:36,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

35
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:38,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

36
00:05:38,326 --> 00:05:39,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how are you feeling?

37
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:40,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh.

38
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:41,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

39
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I'm negative for COVID now.

40
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:45,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

41
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:49,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I did go out to see Deadpool and Wolverine today, though.

42
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:51,218
[SPEAKER_03]: The day he was negative, he was like, bye.

43
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,602
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I've been negative for like a week, but like, I... Well, that shit stays with you.

44
00:05:56,383 --> 00:06:14,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just still tired and I still have like the like I have like other like abdominal pain too like which I I'm thinking is part of the stuff but I don't know yeah and then um just it's just tired you know a lingering cough but it is kind of going away it's been getting less each day

45
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,484
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,363
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:13,943
[SPEAKER_04]: technically it never tested as COVID but like come on like what what else causes a buffet of unexplained symptoms where like it's like what's with the pink but the but the pink eye and everything I don't know because no it did because she gave me antibiotics didn't go away so no it wasn't even okay

48
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:15,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was viral, for sure.

49
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:26,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then that could have been, like, true conjunctivitis, because that would... Actually, no, they were saying... Because I have a sinus infection, and I knew it was a sinus infection when I took the second swab out of my nose.

50
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:35,675
[SPEAKER_07]: But bacterial infections can lead to secondary, so... Yeah, I don't know.

51
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:38,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if it didn't do anything for that, then you had to have been viral.

52
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:39,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I don't know.

53
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,284
[SPEAKER_04]: But the worst part of all that was the sore throat.

54
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:48,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the pink eye was the biggest annoying part, but the sore throat was kind of like the lingering thing.

55
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:52,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So I almost wonder like, oh, do I just kind of have that going on?

56
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:53,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, just remnants of that.

57
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:54,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

58
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:54,860
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

59
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,725
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been a little broken here and old at Orange Tons Radio.

60
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:00,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, we weren't here last week.

61
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:01,289
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't planned.

62
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:04,294
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, Loki was out with COVID.

63
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:10,283
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we kind of knew she probably wasn't going to be here because she was on her way back from California Extreme, which we'll talk about during our gaming weeks.

64
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:11,844
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

65
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:40,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's been quite a month, so sorry about it.

66
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:46,744
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not trying to be irregular, but as I said in the beginning of the show, shit happens.

67
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:47,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

68
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:50,168
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will try to keep going.

69
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say we will have a show off that is planned.

70
00:08:55,093 --> 00:09:01,558
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the month, Labor Day weekend, I've been taking that show off for over a decade because of DragonCon.

71
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:10,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be at DragonCon out in Atlanta, and I definitely encourage you, if DragonCon is on your radar, you're in the Atlanta area or the Southeast U.S.

72
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:14,588
[SPEAKER_04]: at all, or have the means to get to DragonCon, get there for sure.

73
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:17,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Because DragonCon's a lot of fun.

74
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a lot of fun this year.

75
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:21,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited for it, so stay tuned.

76
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,934
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also a very important weekend for me.

77
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,197
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, because your anniversary is around then, right?

78
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:28,986
[SPEAKER_07]: September 1st is mine and Dan's 19th anniversary.

79
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:31,171
[SPEAKER_04]: And the day after that is my dad's birthday.

80
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:32,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Dad.

81
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a massive...

82
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:57,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the term would be a total conversion.

83
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:04,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's essentially a mod for Fallout 4 that completely... It's like a whole new game, essentially.

84
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,349
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's cool is they add a lot of cool elements from other Fallout games.

85
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:14,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a different skill tree in it, similar to Fallout New Vegas.

86
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:14,854
[SPEAKER_03]: They have different...

87
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:19,169
[SPEAKER_03]: specialties that you can get.

88
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:22,410
[SPEAKER_03]: There's positives and negatives with them as well.

89
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool, but it's completely voiced by voice actors.

90
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:29,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks incredible.

91
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:37,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet, but I have some friends that have played it, and they are very enthusiastic.

92
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:41,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, it's the new Fallout game you've been waiting for.

93
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,514
[SPEAKER_03]: The way it's done.

94
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:43,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very glad that...

95
00:10:45,777 --> 00:11:11,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft and Bethesda have let it exist you know what I mean because yeah like they could easily just smash this be like oh you know you're trying to represent your game like Fallout but no it's a really cool looking game well and surely they have to see the benefit of you know Fallout is an aged game at this point so anything that makes people interested in it again wanting to stream it download it engage with it I mean that's that's a win so you know

96
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:18,525
[SPEAKER_04]: and Kudos to the modding community who oftentimes doesn't get appreciated enough for the hard work they do, but that's incredible work.

97
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:19,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

98
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:20,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So, kudos.

99
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:26,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I could see certainly a scenario where it sells more copies of Fallout 4 for Bethesda, so...

100
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and is this one of the official ones you can get on the console versions, too?

101
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:34,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can get it on console.

102
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It is on good old games, though.

103
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:40,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can download it through them.

104
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Quest Buster Clarify is not consoles.

105
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:47,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know some mods are available in the Bethesda, yeah.

106
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:53,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I don't know if it... Yeah, I don't think they would ever have it on consoles.

107
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it could handle that, but PC for sure.

108
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

109
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:04,111
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says all part of Todd Howard's plan to get people to buy Fallout 4 and Skyrim again.

110
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:08,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Todd Howard likes Starfield to sell some more copies.

111
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:08,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.

112
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:11,256
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd probably like you to buy that game instead at this point.

113
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly right.

114
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:24,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, even I saw some scenes on I want to say TikTok of all places of that mod and it was a scene where they were destroying the giant Ferris wheel in London and it was a whole like exchange and you see it.

115
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:25,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

116
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:26,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the eye.

117
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:48,701
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

118
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:10,827
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no good news.

119
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:18,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe one headline towards the end of the show, but there's a lot of not great news going on in the industry.

120
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what to think about that.

121
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:24,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... Anyway.

122
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,614
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bunch of crap, really.

123
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:30,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

124
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I will flesh out my thought as we tackle some of these headlines.

125
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:44,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to state we are going to be sprinkling in some headlines from last week, the show we missed, because there are some huge topics we want to talk about and kind of give our viewpoint on and get your viewpoint on.

126
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:48,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to sprinkle some of that in here as well, because some of you in chat will say, that happened last week.

127
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we know.

128
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:51,762
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play catch up a little bit with some of the big headlines.

129
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:52,803
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

130
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:54,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of us are doing other things.

131
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:54,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

132
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:54,844
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

133
00:13:54,944 --> 00:13:56,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

134
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but let's start off with something from this week, which is, you know, a bummer to hear.

135
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:01,510
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, please.

136
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:02,871
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

137
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:20,687
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been a good run, but Game Informer, which is definitely one of the last gaming magazines out there that, I mean, even was very recently quoted with a massive spread about the new behavior game, well,

138
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:26,097
[SPEAKER_07]: and other company that brain farted about the casting of Frank Stone.

139
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:28,399
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a big ass spread on that one.

140
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,462
[SPEAKER_07]: But after 33 years, they are shutting down.

141
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:35,303
[SPEAKER_07]: GameStop is closing them out.

142
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:36,944
[SPEAKER_07]: They've laid off their staff.

143
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,732
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't give a reason.

144
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:52,284
[SPEAKER_07]: GameStop didn't reply for a comment other than that, quote, every expense of the company must be scrutinized under a microscope and all waste eliminated.

145
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:56,528
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an email that was obtained by Kotaku.

146
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they were supposed to get that email, but...

147
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:17,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Referring to one of the most trusted magazines or the people that you're paying as waste, that's very, very, very poor, poor sign.

148
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor is a kind word in this scenario, to be fair.

149
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:26,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor is a very professional word to describe this.

150
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a fucking professional, okay?

151
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:28,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you are.

152
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:59,476
[SPEAKER_07]: but another thing that was published by their put up by their editor-in-chief Matt Miller for Game Informer about the post I'm going to just read the quote hard times, layoffs, cancellations and closures have impacted thousands of game developers and publishers as well as other outlets like us that celebrate games sorry Ferret, you have to get laid off no, that's not how it works I

153
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:01,850
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

154
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:11,793
[SPEAKER_07]: These are people that you're talking about in jobs and they are, I mean, as someone who is probably one of the laid off people, I mean, I feel it.

155
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:12,593
[SPEAKER_07]: It's terrible.

156
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:15,194
[SPEAKER_07]: You know.

157
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:23,736
[SPEAKER_07]: They're one of the most trusted magazines in the industry and now they're gone.

158
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:29,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and trusted being that this was a resource from GameStop who has been in the shit.

159
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:48,850
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah um but yeah there was uh it's and a lot of people have come out of the woodwork to show their love and support you know and so here is uh what it says on their uh subscription page

160
00:16:49,870 --> 00:17:02,984
[SPEAKER_07]: The Final Level, Farewell from Game Informer After 33 thrilling years of bringing you the latest news, reviews, and insights Oh, bless you for your Oxford comma Actually, you know what?

161
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:05,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this the official thing that was on their website?

162
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:05,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah

163
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,629
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a lot of talk out there that AI wrote that.

164
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:10,010
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're reading right now.

165
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,130
[SPEAKER_04]: AI wrote that.

166
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:17,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because apparently people have plugged it into a... It did ChatGPT write this and it's coming up positive.

167
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:19,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are some terms in there.

168
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby was dissecting this a little bit on his show.

169
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:28,862
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some terms in there that really point to the fact that this was sourced with things that ChatGPT would source from.

170
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:36,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is not the type of thing where ChatGPT can pull from the Game Informer closure message.

171
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:37,187
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

172
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:40,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have been taken down.

173
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:41,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just take a look myself.

174
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:44,249
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I looked at it just an hour ago when Bobby was talking about it.

175
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:45,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's disgusting then.

176
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,270
[SPEAKER_07]: That's absolutely disgusting.

177
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, yeah, it's disgusting.

178
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,871
[SPEAKER_07]: They can care enough to write something themselves.

179
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:49,871
100%.

180
00:17:52,672 --> 00:18:01,334
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.

181
00:17:52,912 --> 00:18:01,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Let the CEO write something by his own hand, warts and all, but he's too busy talking about his...

182
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:05,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for stopping me because I don't want to give that any space.

183
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:32,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, but I mean, Konami has come out, you know, with a statement about it.

184
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:35,202
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had Naughty Dog folks.

185
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:50,247
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had just so many people, accounts for Discord, Cyberpunk 2077, Assassin's Creed, Metacritic, and the not Twitter thing, I'm not going to say gaming, gave their...

186
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:51,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Their nods.

187
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:54,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, that website has a gaming?

188
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:56,048
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

189
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:57,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

190
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

191
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:58,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

192
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Blink Gaming.

193
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:00,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

194
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:03,173
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm like, what is that?

195
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:04,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, you know, I don't care.

196
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:05,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going back to that place.

197
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:07,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, I'm a little bit like, what?

198
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:08,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Farmville.

199
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:28,790
[SPEAKER_07]: And to keep going, Kit Ellis, who worked for Nintendo for more than 13 years, marketing and PR, was pushing the artwork that had been on Game Informer covers, especially one for Breath of the Wild that was, honestly, I thought it was phenomenal artwork myself.

200
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:35,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Other people were pointing out some of the various covers like The Witcher 3, Wild Hunt.

201
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Tons of the covers just really going off about the artwork.

202
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,940
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was that...

203
00:19:47,077 --> 00:20:09,746
[SPEAKER_07]: repost about the chat GTP and funny enough Jason Schreier I'm gonna mispronounce that I'll just read this I told chat GTP to write a farewell message for Gameformer magazine and it sure looks a lot like the one that GameStop executives published this afternoon it really is like practically identical yikes

204
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:11,610
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's also cool?

205
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Garbage.

206
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:22,478
[SPEAKER_03]: They were still promoting and selling subscriptions to the print magazine up in just July 30th.

207
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:27,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone in chat, just at Record WN in chat said, I just subbed with their standalone offer earlier this year.

208
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:28,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Got four issues.

209
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:29,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Was excited for it.

210
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:34,875
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you consider this was the last gaming magazine in the U.S.

211
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:36,436
[SPEAKER_04]: There's others, you know, around the world.

212
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:44,544
[SPEAKER_04]: But this last one in the U.S., basically, that's, I mean, if you don't count like indie published things, you know, I don't know where you want to draw the line.

213
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:49,148
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, you know, of the large magazines, this was the last one.

214
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:52,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, people wanted a piece of that or to fund that to keep it going.

215
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:53,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just...

216
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,313
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole thing.

217
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:01,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And to basically get rid of the archives of all the old articles is just trash.

218
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, because that 100% tax write-off.

219
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,301
[SPEAKER_04]: 100% threw it in the bin to be a tax write-off.

220
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:14,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can say, oh, we're writing this off as a loss of all these views we're not going to get from what we put in the bin.

221
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:19,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Just... I can't.

222
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't either.

223
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,750
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know who needs to be in the bin?

224
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:23,571
[SPEAKER_04]: The CEO.

225
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:38,491
[SPEAKER_04]: and maybe their social media people too oh yes, Loki why don't you tell us about this so this isn't even about well it's not but it's still about like GameStop open mouth insert foot

226
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:40,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

227
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, as you may remember last week, we talked about how the Xbox 360 store has officially shut down.

228
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:47,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the end of an era.

229
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:53,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, where most people would be like, oh, hey, you know, that's unfortunate.

230
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:55,826
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let's think about all the wonderful things that happened.

231
00:21:56,266 --> 00:22:01,151
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop decides to come out on social media and says, bet y'all wish you bought physical copies now.

232
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:15,608
[SPEAKER_03]: in an extremely tone-deaf announcement during that time, which then, by the way, of course, social media being what it is, everybody responded and just basically destroyed them.

233
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:17,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Where am I going to get physical copies?

234
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at a GameStop.

235
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:19,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

236
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:26,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, physical copies by that, do you mean like, say, Funko Pops or $90 games that are used?

237
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:31,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm sorry, it's just not happening anymore.

238
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,844
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be able to... Like, I've gone into a few GameStops to look at the used games, and the section that's there is so small.

239
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:41,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you just can't find anything anymore.

240
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:42,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

241
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:48,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, it's ridiculous to even see them coming out and saying that kind of stuff.

242
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with like this coming out right around the corner.

243
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:54,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, bet you wish you bought physical copies.

244
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:57,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I bet I wish I bought physical copies of your magazine.

245
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:59,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, I can't because you shut it down.

246
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:00,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops.

247
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:02,430
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that NFT project going?

248
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:08,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't you supposed to be like an NFT, you know, store online that you can sell and trade NFTs?

249
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:09,395
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd that go?

250
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:10,936
[SPEAKER_03]: How was that investment?

251
00:23:11,376 --> 00:23:12,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Really well, you know?

252
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?

253
00:23:14,564 --> 00:23:17,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about... I don't use that social media site anymore.

254
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I've obviously said that a lot.

255
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm not trying to be edgy, but it's just a matter of fact.

256
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't use it.

257
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:27,055
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do remember I blocked the GameStop account some time ago.

258
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:32,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't just because I don't... They sassed me with something.

259
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just said, like, fuck the... You guys can eat my entire...

260
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:38,666
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

261
00:23:57,355 --> 00:24:12,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's... Well, and then, of course, there's people responding to it, so they are talking about, like, for example, they had a copy of Xenoblade Chronicles that was for sale for $90 on their website, or you can buy it pre... Well, that was buy pre-owned for $89.99, or I guess somehow they also have a $84.99...

262
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:35,449
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah um or there was you know where they're talking about how as an employee of GameStop there'd be games that they would consider unsellable and they just have to destroy them so no one would get to buy them or um you know just essentially just talking about all the other stuff you know they used to do bad trading prices and all that um

263
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:46,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't, I can honestly say that I'll be surprised when in the near future we hear something about how all of them are shutting down, like at some point.

264
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:49,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just don't, it's not a surprise.

265
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And sadly, like, I'm not going to miss them at this point.

266
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:58,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they just have, they've been, they're a husk of what they used to be for years now.

267
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:01,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Behavior did their own thing as well.

268
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:08,857
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they pretty much let go of all of their social teams as well.

269
00:25:09,197 --> 00:25:09,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

270
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:09,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

271
00:25:09,877 --> 00:25:11,578
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I remember we got into that a couple weeks ago.

272
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:16,239
[SPEAKER_04]: But with GameStop closing eventually, it's coming.

273
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:18,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, I'm talking about like it's a thing because it's going to happen.

274
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel bad.

275
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:21,201
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my heart goes out.

276
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like being so candid about that.

277
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:28,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that because the people that really are getting affected are the people, hardworking people at those stores.

278
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:32,425
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that are making minimum wage or just above it trying to just

279
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:44,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking earn their money to support themselves, whether it be college endeavors or even life endeavors or what have you, that have to pay for the horrible mistakes made at the top of the company time and time again.

280
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:56,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like these workers, when this day inevitably comes, these workers ought to be able to sue the CEO to get the CEO's bonus package out of negligence for how this company was run.

281
00:25:57,016 --> 00:25:58,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I realize this is a fucking –

282
00:25:59,577 --> 00:26:04,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy, and this would never be something that comes to fruition in America, but damn it.

283
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:22,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that time and time again, when GameStop closes, and it will, the CEO will walk away with a giant fucking payout, and these hardworking people that have tried their fucking best to upsell all this stuff you wanted to shovel all the time are going to walk away with nothing.

284
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:24,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is fucked up.

285
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:28,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, so the email I was referring to earlier, by the way,

286
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:30,016
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

287
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:54,946
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sure.

288
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:56,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

289
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:16,684
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

290
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Prospering in retail means survival.

291
00:27:36,643 --> 00:27:38,385
[SPEAKER_07]: If we survive, we stay in the game.

292
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:42,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Survival is avoiding the deadly sins that often lead retailers to self-destruct.

293
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:44,770
[SPEAKER_07]: This is usually a result of the following.

294
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Buying bad inventory, using leverage, and running expenses too high.

295
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:54,037
[SPEAKER_07]: By avoiding these self-inflicted mistakes and focusing on the basics, GameStop can be here for a long time.

296
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,959
[SPEAKER_07]: he literally said I'm not getting paid yeah

297
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:34,657
[SPEAKER_03]: so so their response so you would think okay GameStop been getting savaged by people online you know because of their comments so what would be the response to that by social media do you think there'd be an apology or are they just going to double down on it so what they decided to do is um they

298
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:41,560
[SPEAKER_03]: They linked the Kotaku article talking about how they're getting savaged by fans with a poop emoji.

299
00:28:42,141 --> 00:28:42,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

300
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:43,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god!

301
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:44,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna make that joke!

302
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:45,583
[SPEAKER_04]: That really happened?

303
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,284
[SPEAKER_09]: That really happened.

304
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:51,967
[SPEAKER_09]: August 1st.

305
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:54,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Poop emoji.

306
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:55,109
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they did.

307
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:01,994
[SPEAKER_09]: It just... It's just... Ugh.

308
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:03,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Their team sucks.

309
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:05,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate GameStop.

310
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:05,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Perish.

311
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:06,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Perish.

312
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:08,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate GameStop.

313
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:09,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Perish.

314
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:14,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I am so, so, so sorry to the many honest people that work for that organization.

315
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:18,023
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've had it.

316
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had it for a long time.

317
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:22,485
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've especially had it today.

318
00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:26,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone to 11 today.

319
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had it with her.

320
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:51,523
[SPEAKER_04]: and then here's the best part there's people defending them and I just want to trash I don't give a do they have check marks next to their name because I don't really I don't give a fuck what they have I do not give a fuck what anyone with a check mark has to say

321
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:59,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf says he's probably not taking a salary, but he is still getting paid through stock dividends.

322
00:29:59,670 --> 00:29:59,650
1,011%.

323
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:00,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

324
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:32,537
[SPEAKER_04]: uh Questbuster says as a side note GameStop CEO is being sued by Bed Bath & Beyond for insider trading I love Bed Bath & Beyond what a lovely place unfortunately I think they were also at least most of the stores around here that was them closed but what a what a lovely what a lovely great set of set of memories I have at Bed Bath & Beyond anyway

325
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:35,566
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

326
00:30:58,162 --> 00:30:58,903
[SPEAKER_04]: and EB Games.

327
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:00,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember Babbage's?

328
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:01,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys have a Babbage's?

329
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:05,369
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we did have EB Games and we had Funco Land was the big one around here.

330
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:07,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, Dan started off with Funco Land.

331
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:09,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all.

332
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:11,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'd give you the paper that had all the prices on it.

333
00:31:12,054 --> 00:31:13,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because they used to advertise in magazines.

334
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:36,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so I, fuck me, I played a bunch of stuff So last weekend I went to California Extreme, and if I'm looking down at my phone so I can figure out what the heck I played But California Extreme, for those who don't know, it's classic gaming, arcade machines mostly, they have candy cab setups

335
00:31:37,086 --> 00:32:00,698
[SPEAKER_07]: um you know the Japanese you know sit down style um they had a music game section that honestly I didn't really get too interested in um but it was it was pretty it was pretty fun I mean and we actually stayed this time so it was nice just being able to take my time and wander around and I think I hung out more with dealers you know um

336
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:08,962
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I did a drink of whiskey with one of the dealers that I chat with every year.

337
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:09,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice.

338
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:13,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get my amaretto sour like I normally do.

339
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:17,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had a really, really good flatbread pizza, but that's besides the point.

340
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:20,687
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, let me see.

341
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:25,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to meet one of my heroes, kinda.

342
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Was Warren Davis.

343
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we know who he is, everybody?

344
00:32:33,211 --> 00:33:00,227
[SPEAKER_07]: he created Q-Bert and really nice guy really nice guy we just chatted for a while he knows a lot of the Star Trek people it was very interesting he's just a really cool guy I went to the Kroll panel about the making of the Kroll arcade machine and then the home release

345
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:05,382
[SPEAKER_07]: and actually he's interested in coming on the show.

346
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:06,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to have him.

347
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:08,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an autographed copy of his book.

348
00:33:08,785 --> 00:33:11,068
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will only speak to him in Qbert speak.

349
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:42,720
[SPEAKER_04]: and I told him I had the best home version and he's like which one is that and I'm like the ColecoVision and he's like yeah I want to ask him how terrible that Playstation 4 version was he probably won't even know what it is he'll be like tell me about it just don't do yourself a favor just go play the Coleco version that's us together I used to love the Coleco version of Q-Bert that was like my jam it was really the best one

350
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:51,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, what I'd like to know, he probably doesn't know, and I wouldn't want to bug him about that, but I would love to have a Qbert 1UP machine.

351
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:57,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say that, and somebody in chat is going to link it and be like, here, Rob, you dummy.

352
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:01,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just haven't seen one out in the wild, or it packaged with other stuff.

353
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,911
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they have one, they haven't had it out in the wild in a while.

354
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:05,492
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd love to have a Qbert 1UP.

355
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:12,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, by the way, when I covered the old handheld electronic games?

356
00:34:15,529 --> 00:34:17,710
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a bunch of the ones that I covered.

357
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:21,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't buy any.

358
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:31,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I don't know if I've spoken about these, but one of the tables had the Atari 2600 Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

359
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:32,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's cool.

360
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:36,219
[SPEAKER_07]: They were $700 a pop.

361
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:42,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone else, while I was there, bought a piece of the original World of Warcraft server.

362
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I remember when they were selling those.

363
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,814
[SPEAKER_04]: They auctioned those off for charity some time ago.

364
00:34:48,915 --> 00:34:49,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

365
00:34:50,616 --> 00:34:52,096
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like $750?

366
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:54,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Something like that?

367
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:55,438
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a picture.

368
00:34:55,458 --> 00:35:07,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so also, now this made me happy, is that there was Gradius playing on a ColecoVision with the Super Game Module installed.

369
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:10,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I know people are really able to see my phone.

370
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:11,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

371
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:15,226
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's this big add-on.

372
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,849
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were smarter, I'd have you send these pictures to me in advance.

373
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:20,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll send you the pictures later.

374
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I might make a video or something.

375
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:23,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's going to take me time to compile it.

376
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:32,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, if you want to believe the leaks, there is a prototype Tetris and Q-Bert cabinet.

377
00:35:33,138 --> 00:35:34,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck.

378
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:35,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would be a good one.

379
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is my camera all screwy now?

380
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:38,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you were holding your phone up next to it.

381
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:39,262
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

382
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:50,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, Bobby just confirmed in chat there is no legit Qbert arcade one-up yet, which is a wink saying people have put it on their arcade one-ups because obviously you know people have hacked those things to run emulators.

383
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So, which I don't know if I want to do.

384
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I will say this.

385
00:35:56,013 --> 00:36:11,133
[SPEAKER_04]: My baby, sorry, Jamie, I don't mean to divert too much, but just quickly, my little, not baby Pac-Man, but my baby Miss Pac-Man Arcade 1-Up, I may be getting a different Pac-Man cab, and if I do, I might want to hack this one.

386
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:15,596
[SPEAKER_04]: because it will overlap most of the games.

387
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:16,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It just won't overlap Ms.

388
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:18,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man if I get the other ones.

389
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:20,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, just saying that on my hack.

390
00:36:20,921 --> 00:36:21,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry, Jamie.

391
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:26,947
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, so yeah, stuff.

392
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:31,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as what I played, I played video pinball.

393
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:58,227
[SPEAKER_07]: which honestly is kind of fun there was a group up there called Super Mad Ness that were doing rock covers of Nintendo and other video game franchises there was a guy, it was his first California Extreme who had CD-i games oh

394
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got to talking for a little bit.

395
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:02,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Journey.

396
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:03,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Strider.

397
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:06,606
[SPEAKER_07]: The joystick on that Strider was kind of messed up.

398
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:07,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Krull.

399
00:37:07,587 --> 00:37:08,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Super Pac-Man.

400
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:15,234
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the tables that I spent a little bit of time at had a Paprium.

401
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:17,996
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was selling it for $850.

402
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was so mad about it.

403
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,342
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also the JN Silent Bob Ball Brawl.

404
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:53,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I played some Batsugun I played Oshaberry Proteus Arcade I played I have a picture of Dan playing Donkey Kong I played Kicks I played a lot of fucking Kicks My scores are on that Kicks If anyone sees S-A-K that is me Sock Sock I played R-Type

405
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:58,239
[SPEAKER_07]: with another controller that needed some attention.

406
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked up some games.

407
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:02,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

408
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, while you're doing that, I just want to quickly answer a chat question.

409
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:08,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Record WN says people bring their machines to the show, right?

410
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:09,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds awesome.

411
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:15,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's basically what this whole thing is, is it's really a celebration of retro gaming and collecting.

412
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:18,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And so private collectors bring their machines

413
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:24,554
[SPEAKER_04]: machines to this exhibition hall, a hotel ballroom, I think.

414
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:28,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's technically a convention center attached to the Hyatt or whatever.

415
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:32,520
[SPEAKER_04]: But they bring their machines to this, pinball machines, 80s machines, and so forth.

416
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:39,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why, as DarkSakura was saying, some of the controllers were a little wonky because they belong to private collectors and so forth.

417
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:47,030
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they obviously have panels, vendors, and the vendors oftentimes specialize in how to fix these things up and all that.

418
00:38:47,836 --> 00:38:49,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and Rinchan is in chat.

419
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:59,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely saw them go through some Dodonpachi and also listed Devil Blade, Sai Daiojo.

420
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:03,185
[SPEAKER_07]: But we played Nightmare in the Dark together and beat it.

421
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:07,187
[SPEAKER_07]: That game, I freaking love that game.

422
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:08,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pissed it didn't come out.

423
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:13,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of the games I picked up as I got Power of the Hired...

424
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,120
[SPEAKER_07]: for Super Famicom.

425
00:39:18,181 --> 00:39:20,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to reset my camera again.

426
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:29,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got Wonder Project J. So now that I have these, that means I can play them for my retro night.

427
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonder Project J fixed your camera, by the way.

428
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Wonder Project J fixed my camera.

429
00:39:37,037 --> 00:39:38,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a bunch of posters.

430
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:41,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see what Melody got?

431
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Our friend Melody.

432
00:39:42,901 --> 00:39:43,722
[SPEAKER_04]: She texted me.

433
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:45,784
[SPEAKER_04]: She texted me a picture.

434
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:49,166
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, do you know how much I spent at California Extreme this year?

435
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just like, oh no.

436
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:56,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And she replies, and it's a picture of her in front of a Foo Fighters pinball table in her house.

437
00:39:56,992 --> 00:39:59,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, oh my god, another one of my friends.

438
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one of my friends succumbs to pinball addiction.

439
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:04,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Help, I'm surrounded by pinball addicts.

440
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:10,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I may be ending up lending her one of mine.

441
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:19,510
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did pick up, you know me, I'm not like the biggest of Pokemon fans, but I could not pass up this adorable Shichijiki.

442
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,031
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute.

443
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,013
[SPEAKER_07]: So I looked at the yen sticker still on there.

444
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:24,074
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, so this was 500 yen.

445
00:40:24,294 --> 00:40:25,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you five bucks for it.

446
00:40:25,855 --> 00:40:27,237
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, fine, because it's you.

447
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

448
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:31,352
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the guy I shared the whiskey with.

449
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:35,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew somebody in chat would say, Rob, it's your turn, which Bobby Blackwolf says there.

450
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:38,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not in this house.

451
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:42,299
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't Oshaberry, it was Gokujo Parodia, sorry.

452
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,524
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I did watch Rin-chan succumb to the mermaid.

453
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:55,307
[SPEAKER_07]: You just kind of have to bomb your way in with the mermaid, I swear.

454
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:55,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

455
00:40:57,276 --> 00:41:00,979
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I wasn't really too excited.

456
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:06,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they had the Beatmania 3 and I always played the Beatmania 3 and this year I just didn't.

457
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:08,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't play DDR.

458
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:11,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really play any of the other music games.

459
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:14,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of, I don't know, wasn't feeling it for once.

460
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:16,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm kind of disappointed with myself.

461
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:26,656
[SPEAKER_07]: But I spent a lot of time with the Candy Cabs and just like playing what, I think for me, this year was about people and I'm usually not

462
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:35,669
[SPEAKER_07]: a very much people person I met a delightful artist I have to find where I put my badge but her name is also Jamie

463
00:41:37,482 --> 00:42:00,960
[SPEAKER_07]: and uh and she did these keychains i might be commissioning her for uh some art for myself but um she um i'm trying to find it's uh yojambo is is uh her online handle um but she did these adorable uh Baldur's Gate 3 like i have uh

464
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a charm that's a starry and drinking from like a sippy cup of blood.

465
00:42:06,322 --> 00:42:10,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have one of Lae'zel and Shadowheart in there.

466
00:42:10,604 --> 00:42:11,904
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our get-along shirt.

467
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:18,567
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was pretty, pretty fun.

468
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:20,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I love her art style.

469
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:21,468
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked shop for a little bit.

470
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:23,929
[SPEAKER_07]: But mostly it was just like...

471
00:42:25,447 --> 00:42:29,589
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice just to be able to stay and then soak in a very hot bathtub.

472
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:31,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You were mentioning you were looking forward to that.

473
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.

474
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Rin-chan, that was the artist there.

475
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:35,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she was there last year.

476
00:42:36,852 --> 00:42:40,433
[SPEAKER_07]: But we just stopped and was like, okay, do you spell it right?

477
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:43,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were both like, yes, with an I-E.

478
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:44,295
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny.

479
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:48,449
[SPEAKER_07]: But I had a really good time, you know, it was chill.

480
00:42:49,129 --> 00:43:02,782
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice having the hotel room for another reason is because like sometimes that floor can get a little bit overwhelming or you might be a consumer whore like me and you need to go drop some stuff off or just drop yourself off.

481
00:43:04,143 --> 00:43:08,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I did a sit down for like a minute and then next thing I knew I had taken a 20 minute nap.

482
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:09,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

483
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:21,080
[SPEAKER_07]: but yeah, it's I really, I can't speak highly enough of the convention center as well of

484
00:43:24,008 --> 00:43:25,949
[SPEAKER_07]: of the staff working it.

485
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:30,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just... It was really just a wonderful time.

486
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:35,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and Bobby, I get that having a room at Southern Fry Gaming Expo, even though you live 15 miles away.

487
00:43:36,674 --> 00:43:38,115
[SPEAKER_07]: We live a little bit further than that.

488
00:43:38,135 --> 00:43:45,459
[SPEAKER_07]: We're about two and a half hours of a drive, and especially with Bay Area traffic, please up.

489
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:49,741
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a really...

490
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:52,927
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

491
00:44:12,006 --> 00:44:25,862
[SPEAKER_07]: and then there's always a Super Graphics that's there and a series of homebrew games, you know, Hither and Yawn and yeah, Atlanta traffic is hot garbage.

492
00:44:26,343 --> 00:44:26,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

493
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:27,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to the Olympics!

494
00:44:29,286 --> 00:44:36,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I just, I really, I mean, I know I've said over and over I've had a good time, but I really had a good time.

495
00:44:37,497 --> 00:44:43,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And the next day, like I said, I didn't know if it was COVID or chronic fatigue, but I was...

496
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:45,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't move.

497
00:44:45,756 --> 00:44:51,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I was ready to be done when we got in the car, but I was still pushing myself to play different things like I wanted to.

498
00:44:53,003 --> 00:44:58,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and a 20-something year old tried to get my digits.

499
00:44:59,309 --> 00:44:59,870
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

500
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:01,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

501
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:05,680
[SPEAKER_07]: We were like, I was like, oh yeah, I remember all of this when all I could get it was fan subbed.

502
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, that totally dated me.

503
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:14,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I remember being in college in the 90s and having fan subs of Dragon Ball Z and raw copies of Ranma 1.5 and getting all the Sailor Moon, blah, blah, blah.

504
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:16,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, oh.

505
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:21,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm at another table and he comes over and says, I hope this isn't too forward, but can I get your phone number?

506
00:45:21,904 --> 00:45:26,666
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, and this is how I'm going to put people down gently from here on.

507
00:45:27,526 --> 00:45:28,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I can give you my email.

508
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:30,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

509
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:38,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like to use the me being married or with somebody else as an excuse because when you say no, no is the answer.

510
00:45:39,327 --> 00:45:45,570
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think he got the point and he was really nice about it.

511
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,812
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was like, okay, okay.

512
00:45:50,472 --> 00:45:52,553
[SPEAKER_07]: My ego was a little bit stoked for a bit.

513
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And I told Dan and he laughed.

514
00:45:55,934 --> 00:45:57,755
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the response you're supposed to make!

515
00:45:59,076 --> 00:46:01,058
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to go, wow, that's awesome!

516
00:46:01,938 --> 00:46:04,320
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, he just, I thought it was funny.

517
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was funny and adorable, and he was just like, oh, yeah.

518
00:46:07,743 --> 00:46:09,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And he looked a little gratified, so.

519
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:15,088
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that was my California extreme.

520
00:46:15,268 --> 00:46:17,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It was full of twists and surprises.

521
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you had a good time.

522
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to keep missing it, but I was hosting a show on that Saturday night, so...

523
00:46:23,964 --> 00:46:24,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens.

524
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:27,265
[SPEAKER_07]: But next year, next year, you gotta come.

525
00:46:27,406 --> 00:46:31,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if there's not a conflict again, which there always seems to be one, but I'd love to go back.

526
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:31,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to go back.

527
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:38,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to save up for DragonCon, but I've also... My big one is TwitchCon, so... Yeah, that's fair.

528
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,011
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, TwitchCon over...

529
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:42,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I get it.

530
00:46:43,025 --> 00:46:46,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Big convention full of a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of people.

531
00:46:48,227 --> 00:46:48,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, let's go to you.

532
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:49,908
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

533
00:46:50,248 --> 00:46:51,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Conventions or otherwise?

534
00:46:51,628 --> 00:46:52,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you went to any, though.

535
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:54,829
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't go to any conventions.

536
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:59,311
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, it's been a lot, so it's been a month now.

537
00:47:01,011 --> 00:47:01,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let's see.

538
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:05,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm doing lots of Minecraft as usual.

539
00:47:06,238 --> 00:47:10,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not making a whole lot of content because I've been busy behind the scenes doing a bunch of stuff.

540
00:47:10,883 --> 00:47:12,886
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, you've been sick as hell.

541
00:47:13,658 --> 00:47:16,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but that doesn't necessarily stop me.

542
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:24,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been behind the scenes updating our server to 1.21, which is the new version.

543
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:38,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, there's a lot of server migration, mod updates, mods not being supported anymore, and I'm having to create workarounds to get stuff in the game that we had in there before and all that fun stuff.

544
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a lot of work to do all that.

545
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still working on that stuff.

546
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:49,069
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also did compete in a build competition with Ross Cumber.

547
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:57,337
[SPEAKER_03]: It's her Build by Build event, which essentially is a charity event that supports diabetes research.

548
00:47:58,218 --> 00:48:04,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had a bunch of celebrity judges from Hermitcraft and other things.

549
00:48:04,143 --> 00:48:07,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's two Hermits from Hermitcraft and a few other folks that are...

550
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:10,567
[SPEAKER_03]: One guy from Empires and stuff like that.

551
00:48:11,207 --> 00:48:13,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I did end up winning one of the categories.

552
00:48:13,908 --> 00:48:19,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had a pretty awesome build with Penko, which is the mascot.

553
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,230
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a blue cat.

554
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did like a...

555
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's like a diorama, but not really.

556
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:40,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a bunch of giant builds that were essentially Penko sleeping, and then there was some different dreams that the cat was having, so it was eating a bowl.

557
00:48:41,361 --> 00:48:41,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Penko?

558
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:44,843
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that spelled?

559
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:45,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the breadcrumbs.

560
00:48:46,143 --> 00:48:46,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, like Ponko.

561
00:48:47,164 --> 00:48:49,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Ponko, yeah.

562
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:52,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to look up the cat because I wanted to see.

563
00:48:53,379 --> 00:48:54,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I posted it on Twitter.

564
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what a cutie!

565
00:48:57,522 --> 00:48:59,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's on Twitter.

566
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:14,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And so essentially, I built the cat sleeping, the cat eating sushi, doing a superhero landing pose, and then laying on a cloud, playing with the moon like a ball of yarn.

567
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:38,821
[SPEAKER_03]: so I did all that and I won that most panko category which it was just they split it up in like um I think most creative uh most panko most blue most um judges choice and some other thing there's apparently also a cat called named panko a cat panko a cat but that's awfully cute I'm gonna see I'm gonna see your work

568
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:45,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so there's the build there.

569
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:47,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hard to get it all in one screenshot.

570
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:48,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

571
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:50,486
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really good.

572
00:49:50,506 --> 00:49:50,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for you.

573
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:53,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

574
00:49:53,926 --> 00:49:55,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, I did that.

575
00:49:55,707 --> 00:49:56,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was fun.

576
00:49:56,688 --> 00:50:02,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've been working on stuff for the theme park in Channel 64 as well as on another SMP right now.

577
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:07,573
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a kind of a survival challenge thing that's all in a frozen world.

578
00:50:07,753 --> 00:50:09,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not like certain resources.

579
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing that as well.

580
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,217
[SPEAKER_03]: But on Channel 64, I have two rides that I've got

581
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:28,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Crazy Mouse coaster that's going to be... It's sort of based off of the now... I mean, it was a long time ago that they took it down, but the Crazy Mouse that was at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.

582
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:33,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Long time ago, but pre-Log Flumes there.

583
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:33,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

584
00:50:35,595 --> 00:50:36,717
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

585
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:52,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

586
00:51:14,437 --> 00:51:17,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop Tower Ride that is in the game now.

587
00:51:17,498 --> 00:51:20,379
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be building that in an episode hopefully coming soon.

588
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:21,079
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a month.

589
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been trying to keep up on that.

590
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,101
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, making progress.

591
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:28,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

592
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:32,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and in other games, not so much in other games.

593
00:51:33,043 --> 00:51:38,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get to play some laser tag at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and I still have it.

594
00:51:39,825 --> 00:51:40,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I still got it.

595
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:41,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I destroyed them.

596
00:51:44,225 --> 00:52:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh yeah I didn't get to play any games necessarily I did get to see an Indigroove 3 machine which I'm like okay that's not a thing but there it is um so that was interesting where the DDR Extreme used to be which I think is my machine but I don't know why it's still there so I maybe it's not from the boardwalk but that's where the guy said it was from originally but they do have three arcades so it's hard to say um

597
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:17,979
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, it's been fun so vacation, you know, COVID and busy with other things

598
00:52:18,812 --> 00:52:19,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

599
00:52:19,853 --> 00:52:23,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my give me week, I'm sorry to say I haven't played a lot of new stuff to talk about.

600
00:52:23,315 --> 00:52:27,198
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy XIV Dawn Trail.

601
00:52:27,658 --> 00:52:36,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little... I got a little blindsided by the fact that the Diablo 4 season ends on Tuesday, and I didn't finish the Battle Pass this time around, which is the first season.

602
00:52:36,944 --> 00:52:37,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do it.

603
00:52:37,465 --> 00:52:47,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not because I was disinterested in Diablo, but I just... I went full in on Final Fantasy XIV, so I don't know if I'll do the next season, which is very odd for me to say about Diablo, but I just...

604
00:52:48,252 --> 00:53:16,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to catch up on some other games I have some things I like to play I've actually still been playing the Nintendo World Championships game just going to get my scores I've really tried to clear every challenge with an A or better and I'm through most of the games I only have a few games left Kirby's one of them Mario 3 is actually one of them and there's a couple games I still have to do but I've done like I did Zelda 2 which I figured would be really hard and it was difficult but it wasn't that hard because you have to kill like all the bosses

605
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:22,591
[SPEAKER_04]: The only one that's made you play the complete game so far anyway is the original Super Mario Bros.

606
00:53:23,092 --> 00:53:32,376
[SPEAKER_04]: All the others are like play a level in the game or clear something like... It's usually like 1-1 or the equivalent of the first stage.

607
00:53:32,816 --> 00:53:35,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the last Kid Icarus is beat 1-1.

608
00:53:36,117 --> 00:53:36,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last...

609
00:53:37,978 --> 00:53:40,360
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Donkey Kong actually is a complete game loop.

610
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,543
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to beat a complete game loop one time.

611
00:53:42,623 --> 00:53:44,685
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to do the ladders board.

612
00:53:44,705 --> 00:53:51,411
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do the... I don't know what you call the board with the lifts and all that stuff with the little... Is that Pie Factory?

613
00:53:52,152 --> 00:53:53,693
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Pie Factory wasn't in the NES version.

614
00:53:54,014 --> 00:53:55,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the rivets board.

615
00:53:56,556 --> 00:53:59,278
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

616
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:24,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, well, tomorrow morning at like 10 a.m.

617
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:37,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were pushing these badges to unlock and I don't know how to explain because I know not a lot of you play the same game, but like it would be the equivalent of like spinning 10,000 Pokestops is basically what I don't know how else to say it.

618
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:40,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been going hard in that game.

619
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:40,587
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

620
00:54:40,887 --> 00:54:41,507
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not hacks.

621
00:54:41,587 --> 00:54:42,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's links.

622
00:54:43,108 --> 00:54:49,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So throwing the equivalent of it's 10,000 points at three points a link.

623
00:54:50,372 --> 00:54:56,006
[SPEAKER_04]: so you do the math like 3,300 links in the scope of two weeks and I was sick the first week

624
00:54:57,153 --> 00:55:00,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went hard on that game this week, but I did it.

625
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:01,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it.

626
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, good times.

627
00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:04,716
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

628
00:55:05,856 --> 00:55:10,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's get into some more gaming news.

629
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:12,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, it's not good news.

630
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:14,079
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

631
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:14,559
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it is.

632
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:17,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It is more things that are going to make you angry.

633
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to say, but we don't write the news.

634
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:20,441
[SPEAKER_04]: We just report it.

635
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:20,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

636
00:55:21,164 --> 00:55:23,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Life is pain, anyone who tells you different is selling something.

637
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:42,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so Bungie is undergoing lots of changes with layoffs and massive restructuring as they incorporate themselves more into Sony and spinning off one of their in-development games into separate PlayStation Studios.

638
00:55:45,373 --> 00:55:50,176
[SPEAKER_03]: CEO Pete Parsons called it a difficult and painful day for the team.

639
00:55:50,816 --> 00:56:03,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm sure it's very difficult and painful for CEO Pete Parsons who has spent the entire time since they got purchased by Sony purchasing classic cars for millions of dollars.

640
00:56:03,984 --> 00:56:05,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's really tough for him.

641
00:56:05,965 --> 00:56:11,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So tough that he had to go purchase some more classic cars after this whole announcement came out.

642
00:56:11,728 --> 00:56:12,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.

643
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:13,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

644
00:56:15,783 --> 00:56:16,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways...

645
00:56:34,346 --> 00:56:47,310
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something very satisfying about watching what's happening with him because CEOs need to be accountable, especially in these crass situations.

646
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,170
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why people hate the rich.

647
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,311
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why people hate the rich.

648
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:55,172
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you get rich?

649
00:56:56,794 --> 00:57:10,225
[SPEAKER_03]: from the Destiny 2 community lead, Dylan Gaffner, who responded to the announcement from Bungie on Twitter saying, inexcusable industry leading talent being lost yet again.

650
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:17,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Accountability falling upon the workers who have pushed the needle to develop or deliver our community time and time again.

651
00:57:18,312 --> 00:57:22,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Please maintain focus on those who have lost their position and income.

652
00:57:22,636 --> 00:57:24,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Offer help where you can.

653
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:46,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And according to CEO Parsons, the statement going out, due to rising costs of development and industry shifts, as well as enduring economic conditions, has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development on entirely on Destiny and Marathon.

654
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:54,324
[SPEAKER_03]: This means beginning today, 220 of our roles will be eliminated, representing roughly 17% of our studio's workforce.

655
00:57:56,298 --> 00:58:23,946
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're integrating it says we are deepening our integration with Sony Interactive Entertainment working to integrate 155 of our roles roughly 12% over the next few quarters but yeah I mean I don't really feel bad for him honestly and I feel that maybe pay the CEO less maybe pay them less because he's obviously not doing a lot of work here could he sell a car?

656
00:58:25,718 --> 00:58:27,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he could sell plenty of cars.

657
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:29,859
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got, like, 20-plus cars.

658
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:32,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And why does somebody need 20 cars?

659
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:34,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's a collector.

660
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:34,940
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just his hobby.

661
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

662
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,500
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just his hobby.

663
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:38,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

664
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:44,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe I need to shut the fuck up because I have arcade machines behind me, but they're wrapped up.

665
00:58:44,841 --> 00:58:45,761
[SPEAKER_04]: They're sold at Walmart.

666
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:54,783
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I'm also not in this business of being so callous, but whatever.

667
00:58:56,371 --> 00:59:06,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, so essentially, even like two months ago, he says a winning bid of $91,500 for a 1961 blue Chevrolet Corvette.

668
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:15,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, they're all tracking this through the website Bring a Trailer, which is like an auction site for classic cars.

669
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:23,112
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, I don't really... I don't feel bad for him at all, honestly.

670
00:59:23,132 --> 00:59:24,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

671
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:29,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and the people I feel bad for are the people on the front lines.

672
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:37,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand that Destiny 2 probably has been struggling a little bit and has not performed up to the expectations they had for it.

673
00:59:37,663 --> 00:59:51,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And my understanding is there is no plans for another – I don't think another – I'm sorry if I'm misstating, but I don't think there's another Destiny 2 expansion being planned because you know people are squawking that got laid off talking about what's going on, which I don't blame them.

674
00:59:52,268 --> 00:59:57,032
[SPEAKER_04]: and Destiny 3 is not in the cards.

675
00:59:57,773 --> 01:00:02,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So Destiny is essentially kind of you got what you got and that's it.

676
01:00:03,018 --> 01:00:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Now obviously Marathon is on the horizon and there's a lot of...

677
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:32,863
[SPEAKER_04]: spiritual successor if you will sort of thing although I realize that's ironic as Marathon was Bungie's original title but I think we all know all these years later it's going to look very very very very different so yeah so I mean I understand that decisions were made that is causing Destiny to not need as many resources as it had before however who ultimately made those decisions?

678
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the hardworking artists?

679
01:00:35,525 --> 01:00:36,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Programmers?

680
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:47,368
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's investors and stuff like that because, once again, you have to keep making infinite growth, which is impossible.

681
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:55,650
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's why we see this cycle of hiring and firing, layoffs and all this stuff, especially when they have a successful product.

682
01:00:56,591 --> 01:01:02,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It's to make that infinite growth happen so that the investors are happy.

683
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:02,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

684
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:13,573
[SPEAKER_04]: because every game thinks it can be the next Fortnite scale, Genshin Impact scale game, Pokemon Go scale game that makes that kind of money.

685
01:01:13,813 --> 01:01:16,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody is convinced that is going to be their game.

686
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best way to do it is to copy it.

687
01:01:18,596 --> 01:01:22,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that's what Destiny is doing before you all want to fight me.

688
01:01:23,259 --> 01:01:23,780
[SPEAKER_04]: However...

689
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:45,963
[SPEAKER_04]: as a free-to-play game, I think there were certain expectations of the marketplace based on the performance of certain other free-to-play games that I feel like these financial forecasters are consistently setting these companies up for failure by these way too unrealistic expectations that everybody's going to have the next big hot fucking thing in gaming.

690
01:01:47,057 --> 01:02:12,095
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's not that Destiny 2 is bad by any means and Destiny 2 had an audience even I played Destiny 2 a little bit and I thought it was kind of you know I'm not and I'm not a big shooty shooty bang bang game player but I liked it was kind of like oh it kind of has like RPG mechanics but it's like a shooter like it's kind of a neat little twist on it and I like the little racing modes were cute uh so you know there were things I appreciated about Destiny um but yeah I just um

691
01:02:15,205 --> 01:02:32,562
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just difficult to see time and time again these astronomical projections were made and people thought as a result their dreams would be fulfilled only to have them yanked away because oops we weren't being realistic anyway

692
01:02:34,403 --> 01:02:34,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

693
01:02:35,063 --> 01:02:43,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about other news that's kind of a bummer, but nobody's losing their job, I guess, is the silver lining here.

694
01:02:43,149 --> 01:02:47,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe in this case, the internet will have this live on.

695
01:02:47,512 --> 01:02:49,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the closure of romhacking.net.

696
01:02:51,174 --> 01:02:56,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Ramhacking.net, of course, is a website where they really specialize in various romhacks.

697
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:59,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you may think of romhacks as a variety of different things.

698
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:05,484
[SPEAKER_04]: You may think of them as very juvenile things where they've replaced Mario with a penis, things like that.

699
01:03:05,504 --> 01:03:12,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember when I was in college, those are the romhacks you would see all the time would be Super Mario, Big Penis, things like that.

700
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:16,872
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, of course, where romhacking probably started.

701
01:03:17,492 --> 01:03:20,654
[SPEAKER_04]: But obviously it's come a long way and it's refined.

702
01:03:20,694 --> 01:03:31,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And while there is still that stuff, if you want to find it, there's a lot of pretty incredible things that ROM hacking has done as well, such as, oh, I don't know, translating games that were never released in English would be a pretty big one.

703
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:40,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Fixing bugs in games that were released, even though they were buggy because to make investors happy.

704
01:03:40,447 --> 01:03:41,128
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

705
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:07,092
[SPEAKER_04]: and RomHacking.net was a huge hub for this type of stuff.

706
01:04:07,473 --> 01:04:11,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And RomHacking.net had been around about as long as this show, 20 years.

707
01:04:12,055 --> 01:04:14,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have decided to wind things down.

708
01:04:15,256 --> 01:04:18,598
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole lot of other talk about the why behind all this.

709
01:04:19,038 --> 01:04:20,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I really want to get into it.

710
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:26,462
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to say, for whatever reason and various reasons, this site has decided to call it a day.

711
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:31,065
[SPEAKER_04]: The good news is it doesn't mean all those ROM hacks are suddenly, bam, deleted.

712
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:34,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, of course, once on the internet, always on the internet.

713
01:04:35,428 --> 01:04:44,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And the site database, including all of the files and images, not your account info, but everything, was submitted to the internet archive.

714
01:04:44,774 --> 01:04:50,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of those ROM hacks, today anyway, are on the internet archive of database and download files.

715
01:04:50,878 --> 01:04:51,859
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

716
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:56,241
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to keep some parts of the site open, like forums and so forth.

717
01:04:57,444 --> 01:04:57,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

718
01:04:58,948 --> 01:04:59,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise.

719
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:03,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this doesn't mean that the ROM hacking community will die.

720
01:05:04,212 --> 01:05:04,812
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it won't.

721
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:06,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I say give it time.

722
01:05:06,993 --> 01:05:11,576
[SPEAKER_04]: There will probably be a few people that are kind of competing so-and-so to be the next one to these websites.

723
01:05:12,017 --> 01:05:17,701
[SPEAKER_04]: But give it time, and I think the community will establish itself under a new banner and keep this sort of thing alive.

724
01:05:19,322 --> 01:05:23,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, yeah, I mean, we talked about earlier in the show when we were talking about Fallout London.

725
01:05:24,165 --> 01:05:28,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe ROM hacks and modding are kind of different things, but they're also kind of not.

726
01:05:29,168 --> 01:05:45,346
[SPEAKER_04]: you know like it is modding in a different kind of sense so it's a very talented community and it's gonna go on and it really comes out of a love for retro games and trying to do different things with them so yeah NinjaBuddy in chat says pour one out for romhacking.net yeah

727
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:52,294
[SPEAKER_04]: SJ100Matt says, yeah, I was there recently for that silly ROM hack of Zelda 2 running on the Super Nintendo.

728
01:05:52,414 --> 01:05:52,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

729
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:54,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Dartetsuya said, funny story.

730
01:05:54,996 --> 01:06:00,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to translate an Othello Game Boy Color game and it's actually still up for the moment.

731
01:06:00,242 --> 01:06:01,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, once on the internet, all on the internet.

732
01:06:02,404 --> 01:06:02,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

733
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:12,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, QuestBuster says contributors will always find a way to get their stuff out, whether it's on GitHub or their own personal sites.

734
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:12,129
100%.

735
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:19,793
[SPEAKER_04]: The community has not died, but it's just one of the big flagships, one of the big cornerstones of the community is sunsetting.

736
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:29,518
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, at least unlike the multi-million dollar GameStop corporation, they didn't delete the entire fucking archives as a tax write-off.

737
01:06:30,834 --> 01:06:32,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, at least to that.

738
01:06:32,536 --> 01:06:37,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever drama might be going on behind the scenes, at least thank you for doing the right thing with that, romhacking.net.

739
01:06:39,382 --> 01:06:42,184
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I think this one is technically from the week we were out.

740
01:06:42,284 --> 01:06:43,686
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it's a huge story.

741
01:06:43,726 --> 01:06:44,707
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to talk about it.

742
01:06:44,747 --> 01:06:49,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to DarkSakura, who is muted on Discord currently.

743
01:06:53,644 --> 01:06:59,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So once again, there is a voice actor strike and it is about AI.

744
01:07:00,092 --> 01:07:08,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I saw this coming because when companies are going right back and saying that they were going to do things that...

745
01:07:09,954 --> 01:07:13,198
[SPEAKER_07]: So they had agreements with voice actors and the voice actors were like, we didn't agree to this.

746
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw this was going to happen again.

747
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:24,190
[SPEAKER_07]: But voice actors are on strike because of the involvement in generative AI.

748
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:51,550
[SPEAKER_07]: After has been in contact with major video game companies for more than half of the year and are now, you know, they wanted things like, you know, clear safety, protection measures, five minute breaks per hour of on-camera work, having an on-set medic when performing stunts, you know, things going in that we want to see happen, we want people's safety, but now artificial intelligence is the big thing.

749
01:07:52,711 --> 01:07:52,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

750
01:07:53,912 --> 01:08:05,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Veronica Taylor, a video game actor who is involved in this, said that she found her voice in voice banks where people can take her voice, and this is a quote, and make it say things I never said.

751
01:08:07,662 --> 01:08:12,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Companies are saying they're offering AI protection, but union members say that they do not extend to everybody.

752
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:21,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And people who do mocap, motion capture, they're afraid now that they're

753
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:28,648
[SPEAKER_07]: The digital actions that they performed could be put in a database without their consent.

754
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:32,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, this...

755
01:08:35,664 --> 01:08:39,505
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that their work is just data.

756
01:08:40,586 --> 01:08:44,387
[SPEAKER_07]: It was done by an actual person who should be paid for their work.

757
01:08:46,607 --> 01:08:56,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand as a designer, typically, if I do a piece, once I give that to my client, it becomes theirs.

758
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:07,514
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also have it out there with the understanding that it's not going to be tore into pieces and reused for people who didn't pay me for it.

759
01:09:07,634 --> 01:09:08,235
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

760
01:09:09,195 --> 01:09:17,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to draw a logo for a company only to have half of that logo given to another company to use for free.

761
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:18,419
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

762
01:09:19,898 --> 01:09:20,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fully behind this.

763
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:33,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this is something, and I'm glad that we're getting this done still in early days of the technology because people are pushing this shit way too hard and I am not into it.

764
01:09:33,913 --> 01:09:34,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

765
01:09:34,659 --> 01:09:35,419
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

766
01:09:54,751 --> 01:10:21,537
[SPEAKER_04]: and the company and so forth but there are many many other people who do not support this especially though you know and if you consider James Earl Jones's motivation for doing it where literally he is getting to the point where he can't do it anymore it's very different than this you know like the voice actress you cited there who is just finding that her voice is being you know lifted for this type of thing and that is ridiculous and this is why people are so anti-AI art right now um

767
01:10:22,997 --> 01:10:34,462
[SPEAKER_04]: is because it is robbing people of these opportunities to do these sorts of performances for themselves when you see the generative stuff being lifted without their permission.

768
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:41,945
[SPEAKER_04]: So these actors absolutely need these sorts of protections and need to be – yeah, I support them 100% in what they're going for here.

769
01:10:42,345 --> 01:10:44,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And actors in Hollywood got the same thing, so good for them.

770
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,239
[SPEAKER_07]: That's between him.

771
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:48,380
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not quite what I'm talking about.

772
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:48,700
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know.

773
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:48,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Not...

774
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:06,054
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not going to be added into a database for people to pretend it's not James Earl Jones.

775
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:07,855
[SPEAKER_07]: His is specific to a purpose.

776
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,277
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not quite the same thing.

777
01:11:10,577 --> 01:11:14,400
[SPEAKER_04]: AI is inevitably happening in this industry and can be a good thing.

778
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:20,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to sound like I'm anti-AI because how are we going to get to 8K graphics and whatever is in the future and all this stuff?

779
01:11:21,066 --> 01:11:29,293
[SPEAKER_04]: AI that is trained on processes and art the company has created, that's how it's going to get there and tools that incorporate that and

780
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:34,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Procedures that are usually a little more manual being a little more automatic.

781
01:11:34,095 --> 01:11:35,235
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it's going to get there.

782
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:41,238
[SPEAKER_04]: But that doesn't mean that you take that from other companies or people on the internet type of thing.

783
01:11:41,438 --> 01:11:43,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's where I'm at with it.

784
01:11:44,952 --> 01:11:49,474
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could, I would actually love to play a message from Jennifer Hale because we love her here.

785
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:57,737
[SPEAKER_04]: And she actually put a minute-long message onto her Twitter account over at JHaleTweets where she's talking about this.

786
01:11:58,597 --> 01:11:59,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you say something, DarkSakura?

787
01:12:00,418 --> 01:12:01,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I just said let's do it.

788
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:01,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm going to do it.

789
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:05,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to my co-host because the way we're raged, you're not going to be able to hear it.

790
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,462
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me go ahead and play it and then we will sum it up because, yeah, I stand by her.

791
01:12:10,522 --> 01:12:11,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's do it.

792
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:14,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Jennifer Hale, voice actor here.

793
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:17,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reaching out to all my fellow voice actors.

794
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:22,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not taking any struck work and I ask that you don't either and I'm going to tell you exactly why.

795
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:26,597
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to protect ourselves from something called generative AI.

796
01:12:27,592 --> 01:12:56,085
[SPEAKER_00]: what that means is that they could for example lift all my lines from previous Mass Effects etc and in not too long a time they'll have the ability to create an entirely brand new Mass Effect game put me in it without my permission and without ever paying me they are working on that technology now most devs don't want to do this most of the people in that negotiating room i don't think want to do this it's just a few corporate holdouts now ask yourself they're making a lot of money off this

797
01:12:57,128 --> 01:12:58,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that money going?

798
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:05,137
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to the bonuses and the shareholders and the profit grabbers and slowly strangling the working people.

799
01:13:05,618 --> 01:13:07,360
[SPEAKER_00]: We actors are just the canary in the coal mine.

800
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,662
[SPEAKER_00]: This money grab is coming for all of us.

801
01:13:10,223 --> 01:13:12,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stand together and say no thank you.

802
01:13:13,627 --> 01:13:17,690
[SPEAKER_04]: She says that so, so well.

803
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,730
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason why.

804
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, because Jennifer Hale is amazing.

805
01:13:21,132 --> 01:13:22,593
[SPEAKER_04]: She says that so well.

806
01:13:22,873 --> 01:13:24,574
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason why I wanted to play that.

807
01:13:25,174 --> 01:13:31,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Because number one, you notice how she says there at the end, this is the canary in the coal mine that's coming for the rest of us.

808
01:13:31,618 --> 01:13:33,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Voice actors are the canary in the coal mine.

809
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:34,100
[SPEAKER_04]: She's absolutely right.

810
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:39,523
[SPEAKER_04]: And when she says, she says, most of the people in the room don't want to do this.

811
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a few corporate holdouts.

812
01:13:42,725 --> 01:13:56,031
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I played that is because it ties into everything else we've been talking about this evening about these companies that have ended up in these shitty situations because of bad decisions being made by higher-ups.

813
01:13:56,451 --> 01:14:05,175
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what the higher-ups want to do to cut costs, is they want to have an AI-generated Commander Shepard, which I will not accept as a Mass Effect fan.

814
01:14:06,754 --> 01:14:31,890
[SPEAKER_04]: um there's also uh SAG-AFTRA put out a TikTok as well I'll just link it for chat but it's on their official TikTok so anyway again I'm sorry I didn't get permission to play that but I'm hoping that Jennifer Hill would not mind uh me spreading her gospel around because I think she nailed it there so um thank you Jennifer Hill for saying that so and um big fan of your work so all right um

815
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:34,476
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

816
01:14:50,182 --> 01:14:56,125
[SPEAKER_04]: for those panels, just like it was a year ago when it was the film industry and conventions that had film actors and stuff.

817
01:14:56,145 --> 01:15:02,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be very interesting because they are not going to be able to talk about struck work, which is an awful lot of it.

818
01:15:02,108 --> 01:15:04,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there are some work that's outside of it.

819
01:15:04,048 --> 01:15:12,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a database you can search and all this stuff, but it's going to be very interesting to talk to those folks without talking about their work necessarily.

820
01:15:13,213 --> 01:15:13,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

821
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:19,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hoping for a quick resolution to the strike that is in the voice actor's favor for sure.

822
01:15:20,113 --> 01:15:23,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, SGO100Matt says, I don't think it will be as long as the film industry one.

823
01:15:23,595 --> 01:15:25,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't either, to be honest.

824
01:15:26,216 --> 01:15:27,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, and I'm really hopeful.

825
01:15:27,577 --> 01:15:28,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I'm not being foolish.

826
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:29,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really hopeful.

827
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:37,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say the way this was all timed, they were able to do Comic-Con promotion because there's some video game content at Comic-Con.

828
01:15:37,403 --> 01:15:38,983
[SPEAKER_04]: They were able to, because it was too quick.

829
01:15:39,344 --> 01:15:41,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the strike happened the day Comic-Con started.

830
01:15:41,765 --> 01:15:43,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So they exempted Comic-Con

831
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:54,253
[SPEAKER_04]: But other conventions after that, including one that might be very front of mind for me, is going to be very interesting to see what happens.

832
01:15:54,493 --> 01:16:07,040
[SPEAKER_04]: So fingers crossed that the voice actors get what they want and that hopefully there's some truth to what Jennifer Salehill is thinking is that most of the people in the room don't want this and they're able to get everybody on their side real quick.

833
01:16:07,421 --> 01:16:07,661
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

834
01:16:09,093 --> 01:16:16,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I don't even know how to set this next article up because I'm over the age of 18.

835
01:16:17,777 --> 01:16:19,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And so none of this makes sense to me.

836
01:16:19,558 --> 01:16:21,839
[SPEAKER_04]: So you may have to explain some of this to me, Loki.

837
01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:23,059
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

838
01:16:23,419 --> 01:16:24,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I will explain this to you.

839
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

840
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:29,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of explain like I'm five, I need you to explain like I'm 45.

841
01:16:30,062 --> 01:16:30,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

842
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:36,165
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's step back a little bit.

843
01:16:37,608 --> 01:16:55,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So in case you haven't heard, and why would you, we are now in the age of 2024 where viral YouTube videos are now being made into full blockbuster production things by Michael Bay.

844
01:16:57,037 --> 01:16:58,919
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the reality that we live in now.

845
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:07,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the new hotness that is out there right now on YouTube, Skibbity Toilet, is a... What?

846
01:17:07,424 --> 01:17:07,884
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this?

847
01:17:08,664 --> 01:17:14,068
[SPEAKER_03]: It's essentially, um, it's a series that has been running for a while now.

848
01:17:14,688 --> 01:17:15,849
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of different videos.

849
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:17,110
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, um...

850
01:17:18,035 --> 01:17:25,059
[SPEAKER_03]: the Source Filmmaker stuff so it's all of the Team Fortress 2 Half-Life Is that related to the Scatman?

851
01:17:28,562 --> 01:17:46,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily it's a different song but yes, essentially it is a character that was made of Half-Life 2 models and a toilet so it's head was coming out of a toilet and singing a song and then it spun off into this weird dystopian war thing with these giant machines and

852
01:17:46,773 --> 01:17:47,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird, creepy things.

853
01:17:47,975 --> 01:17:51,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Michael Bay is like, yes, I will make a movie and a TV series out of this.

854
01:17:52,639 --> 01:18:06,213
[SPEAKER_03]: To which I'm like... I mean, I watch this because it sounds like trash, but there will be explosions and if there is somebody going to do this, Michael Bay would probably be the perfect person to do this, but...

855
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:07,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

856
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:17,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so this was all, of course, created originally with help of, like, Garry's Mod and stuff like that to even create these characters.

857
01:18:17,613 --> 01:18:29,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it was really strange when all of a sudden that Garry's Mod is receiving a cease and desist, or a DMCA takedown of the Skibity Toilet characters.

858
01:18:30,357 --> 01:18:35,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering that that's not even really their you know, their

859
01:18:35,762 --> 01:18:36,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

860
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:13,758
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been resolved, and that, according to the creator of the Skibbity Toys and stuff, that it wasn't from him, and it wasn't from the production company, and it may have been somebody posing as them, creating that takedown, or essentially...

861
01:19:14,538 --> 01:19:42,464
[SPEAKER_03]: and so now that's all been resolved but what hasn't been resolved is the knowledge now that you have that there is a movie coming from movie and TV show let's get that right coming from Michael Bay starring giant toilets and giant people with television heads fighting each other in a crazy war and with assets from the Source Engine like

862
01:19:43,902 --> 01:19:50,624
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that even a thing that is going to exist in the world now?

863
01:19:51,064 --> 01:19:55,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine even outside of just this weird stuff?

864
01:19:55,345 --> 01:20:02,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when back in the day Valve used to put out cool Team Fortress 2 animations?

865
01:20:02,146 --> 01:20:05,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine someone saw that and was like, yes, let's make a movie out of that.

866
01:20:06,027 --> 01:20:13,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Except now it makes no sense whatsoever because it's this crazy storyline that involves giant toilets.

867
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

868
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:18,142
[SPEAKER_04]: What the heck is going on?

869
01:20:18,162 --> 01:20:19,543
[SPEAKER_04]: That's episode one.

870
01:20:19,644 --> 01:20:20,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this... Not necessarily...

871
01:20:40,379 --> 01:21:00,960
[SPEAKER_03]: it's sort of kind of not really it's like distorted but episode one is nothing like you need to go like to episode like 60 or something so that's like the initial thing and that's what it started as and then it just gets stranger and stranger

872
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:07,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's the trash that it is now, or was.

873
01:21:08,379 --> 01:21:16,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now you need to go to episode 60 or 50 or something like that and just see what it's turned into.

874
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:25,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like to talk about this man, but because it was a part of pop culture for a minute, I can't help but think of R. Kelly's Trapped in the Closet.

875
01:21:25,471 --> 01:21:31,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like to talk about him, and you all know why, but I can't help but think about that for some reason.

876
01:21:31,235 --> 01:21:32,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you said go to episode 60?

877
01:21:34,477 --> 01:21:43,264
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 or 60, it's just gonna not resemble anything whatsoever here we go, episode 59, I think this says so close enough, right?

878
01:21:43,644 --> 01:22:01,138
[SPEAKER_04]: sorry everybody, let's take a look at this and now I'm just looking at this giant mech that looks like Legion from Mass Effect is taking off and flying and there's these cameras oh, there's the toilet

879
01:22:02,456 --> 01:22:04,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that's disturbing.

880
01:22:05,719 --> 01:22:06,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't.

881
01:22:06,459 --> 01:22:06,719
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

882
01:22:09,241 --> 01:22:10,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not watching it.

883
01:22:10,242 --> 01:22:11,603
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what the movie's gonna be.

884
01:22:12,223 --> 01:22:13,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this type of stuff.

885
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:24,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm tired of this world.

886
01:22:24,212 --> 01:22:25,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to be a part of it anymore.

887
01:22:28,175 --> 01:22:29,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna become a Luddite.

888
01:22:29,912 --> 01:22:31,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm day one, man.

889
01:22:31,274 --> 01:22:32,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm day one gonna go see this.

890
01:22:33,196 --> 01:22:33,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

891
01:22:36,405 --> 01:22:37,846
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Rob.

892
01:22:37,926 --> 01:22:39,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Are children on drugs?

893
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:49,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can see that this is the type of thing that maybe you put on the TV while you're high as fucking fuck.

894
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:52,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Like while you're like 420 blaze it.

895
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I would say 4,200 blaze it.

896
01:22:56,242 --> 01:22:59,806
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what that is that I just saw.

897
01:23:01,147 --> 01:23:03,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And 12-year-olds, your kids like that, Loki?

898
01:23:03,509 --> 01:23:03,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

899
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:05,613
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah

900
01:23:29,278 --> 01:23:31,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we all learned something tonight.

901
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:35,542
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably didn't need to, but we're just... DarkSakura, we're just trying to be cool and hip.

902
01:23:35,562 --> 01:23:36,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I unlearn, please?

903
01:23:36,923 --> 01:23:50,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally feel like I'm one of those 80-year-olds on that fucking Grandpa Reacts and Grandma Reacts channel watching something that kids are into.

904
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:53,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't imagine how this is gonna work.

905
01:23:53,956 --> 01:23:56,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess they're gonna have to license that from Valve, but like...

906
01:23:59,754 --> 01:24:16,531
[SPEAKER_07]: now here's the thing is it actually going to come out or are we gonna see that this gets cancelled I can only hope that it comes out just because you like bad movies this is gonna be well I like Xanadu but that was better than this

907
01:24:17,865 --> 01:24:22,727
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just going to be whatever it is is going to be amazing.

908
01:24:22,967 --> 01:24:30,609
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be the trashiest of trash and I can't wait to see Skivity Toilet, number one at the box office.

909
01:24:34,495 --> 01:24:41,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then, because you know how, like, movie studios copy other movie studios, so it's going to be like, oh, man, what trend can we get on next?

910
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:44,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just going to be so much meme trash out there.

911
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:45,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

912
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:45,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be.

913
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:51,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Rin Mari is 100% right, though, saying, I mean, Emoji Movie, unfortunately, exists.

914
01:24:51,442 --> 01:24:55,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and don't get me wrong, like, there's a lot of internet memes are really funny.

915
01:24:55,184 --> 01:25:01,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's this song out there, and, you know, I know you don't all listen to girly pop, but Kesha is back because she is.

916
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:02,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Kesha.

917
01:25:02,487 --> 01:25:03,008
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

918
01:25:27,068 --> 01:25:32,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It is cinema excellence, and I highly encourage you to watch the Joyride meme video.

919
01:25:33,351 --> 01:25:35,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I traveled there and back.

920
01:25:35,753 --> 01:25:37,293
[SPEAKER_04]: It was incredible.

921
01:25:37,354 --> 01:25:41,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd play it for you, but I know that's a copyrighted song, so I can't play it.

922
01:25:42,236 --> 01:25:43,657
[SPEAKER_03]: We are getting Angry Birds 3.

923
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:46,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, the Angry Birds movies are good, actually.

924
01:25:46,699 --> 01:25:48,740
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good kid movies, but...

925
01:25:50,826 --> 01:25:57,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, we've seen some, like, obviously some of these that are based off of viral videos, like

926
01:25:59,055 --> 01:26:00,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we forgotten about Pixels?

927
01:26:00,497 --> 01:26:01,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that trash?

928
01:26:02,058 --> 01:26:03,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I did go and see that movie.

929
01:26:03,799 --> 01:26:05,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, what was the name of that movie?

930
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:17,831
[SPEAKER_04]: It was based off the epic Twitter thread about the girl who they went to go do stripping in Florida somewhere and it turned into this whole big thing.

931
01:26:18,511 --> 01:26:19,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan actually took me to see that movie.

932
01:26:20,693 --> 01:26:23,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we saw a movie based off a Twitter thread.

933
01:26:24,776 --> 01:26:26,818
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting.

934
01:26:27,058 --> 01:26:27,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hate it.

935
01:26:27,718 --> 01:26:30,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this is wild.

936
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:35,644
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very much, if I would describe it as a meme, it would be the old lady saying, what?

937
01:26:36,304 --> 01:26:37,425
[SPEAKER_04]: That was me.

938
01:26:41,728 --> 01:26:46,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is going to be great.

939
01:26:47,111 --> 01:26:51,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for a future that has a new Michael Bay skibbity toilet movie because

940
01:26:53,391 --> 01:27:20,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Zola was the movie and I actually looked up Twitter thread movie and it was the first result Zola, that was the name of the movie the only thing greater than a Skibity Toilet I mean there's a lot of things greater than a Skibity Toilet movie but the only thing greater that I can imagine Michael Bay doing as a movie based off of like something in the video game realms would be a Michael Bay Earth Defense Force movie would be amazing and I would see that also day one

941
01:27:20,999 --> 01:27:21,339
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

942
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:27,565
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ wants to know if the toilet... I think Michael Bay read Starship Troopers.

943
01:27:29,367 --> 01:27:32,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It would lose a lot, but I would still watch it.

944
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:36,253
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, is the toilet being played by Chris Pratt?

945
01:27:38,772 --> 01:27:39,312
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty funny.

946
01:27:39,392 --> 01:27:39,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

947
01:27:39,873 --> 01:27:40,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, maybe.

948
01:27:41,154 --> 01:27:44,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, uh, if you... Oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

949
01:27:45,297 --> 01:27:53,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen... Have you seen the, um, style guide leaks of the Minecraft movie assets?

950
01:27:54,183 --> 01:27:56,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what the mobs and stuff look like in that?

951
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:57,365
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

952
01:27:57,665 --> 01:28:00,247
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a horror show coming very soon.

953
01:28:00,267 --> 01:28:00,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

954
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:03,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's right around the corner as well.

955
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:06,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Also gonna see it day one, because it's gonna be trash.

956
01:28:08,522 --> 01:28:10,304
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

957
01:28:27,242 --> 01:28:29,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Winter Olympics and curling.

958
01:28:29,183 --> 01:28:29,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

959
01:28:29,663 --> 01:28:31,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't love curling during the Winter Olympics?

960
01:28:31,443 --> 01:28:32,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the Summer Olympics has this stuff.

961
01:28:33,104 --> 01:28:40,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously there's lots of memes coming out of the Olympics, like the guy from Turkey who won the shooting competition who looks like an assassin.

962
01:28:41,206 --> 01:28:43,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a picture showed up of him and his cat.

963
01:28:44,147 --> 01:28:48,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And the caption was something like, you know, if someone fucks with that cat, they're dead.

964
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:52,635
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like the show I just... I started watching Samurai Cat, by the way.

965
01:28:52,655 --> 01:28:53,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.

966
01:28:53,135 --> 01:28:54,335
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes me think of that offhand.

967
01:28:54,835 --> 01:29:03,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, you know, my perverted ass is thinking about the pole vaulter who lost because he knocked over the pole on the pole vault.

968
01:29:03,617 --> 01:29:04,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know what pole vaulting is.

969
01:29:05,018 --> 01:29:06,198
[SPEAKER_04]: You go and you can't knock over the pole.

970
01:29:06,518 --> 01:29:09,619
[SPEAKER_04]: He knocked over the pole with his pole.

971
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately...

972
01:29:14,016 --> 01:29:15,577
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

973
01:29:44,818 --> 01:29:48,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And, well, the pummel horse guy is also loved by a lot of people.

974
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:51,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Not for that reason, but just, you know, because he looks like a nerd.

975
01:29:51,961 --> 01:29:53,762
[SPEAKER_04]: He looks like a total nerd who does pole vaulting.

976
01:29:53,802 --> 01:29:54,282
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

977
01:29:54,422 --> 01:30:05,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm not bringing up the Olympics just to talk about the memes, but, you know, yeah, Bonds006Chat says, These memes from the Olympic just confirm we should never have gotten internet.

978
01:30:06,427 --> 01:30:22,275
[SPEAKER_04]: or the opening ceremony with Gojira playing on the side of the oh that was pretty awesome I will say the Celine Dion performance if that didn't get you verklempt especially if you know I just care about Gaga

979
01:30:23,055 --> 01:30:48,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I know but you know all the stuff Celine Dion's been going through is really heartbreaking like you know her voice and the therapy and all that stuff and she at least was struggling she that was the first time she sang publicly anyway in like two years was the opening ceremony and like I'll admit it I shed a tear like it was it was gorgeous it was beautiful yes Gaga was great too but that was Celine Dion's moment yeah and Snoop at the Olympics I have to agree with that I love Snoop Dogg he's he's

980
01:30:49,878 --> 01:30:51,719
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like a fun grandpa right now.

981
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:52,460
[SPEAKER_04]: He really is.

982
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:53,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Uncle Snoop.

983
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:53,781
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

984
01:30:54,621 --> 01:30:56,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, what was it?

985
01:30:56,402 --> 01:30:56,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

986
01:30:57,203 --> 01:31:07,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I have some not so great news about the Olympics because usually a new Olympic Games means we're going to get a Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, right?

987
01:31:07,209 --> 01:31:11,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we got a Tokyo one before the Tokyo Olympics actually happened.

988
01:31:11,412 --> 01:31:14,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, COVID, because it was branded Tokyo 2020 because you all know what happened there.

989
01:31:15,555 --> 01:31:17,996
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we had one for the Olympics before that and so on.

990
01:31:18,957 --> 01:31:21,199
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a Mario and Sonic Olympic Games this year.

991
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:23,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are going, well, what happened there?

992
01:31:23,781 --> 01:31:41,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, a veteran behind the Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games series confirmed in an interview with Eurogamer that the decision to end the franchise rested with the International Olympic Committee, who has chosen not to renew the licensing deal with Nintendo and Sega.

993
01:31:42,018 --> 01:31:43,960
[SPEAKER_04]: So it lapsed after the Tokyo Games.

994
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:55,265
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately, according to Lee Cocker, who worked on most of those games in the series, quote, they wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports.

995
01:31:56,005 --> 01:32:02,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the IOC wanted to bring it back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money.

996
01:32:03,348 --> 01:32:08,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And so sure enough, there is a game that came out called Olympics Go Paris.

997
01:32:09,431 --> 01:32:11,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a smartphone, free-to-play game.

998
01:32:12,392 --> 01:32:15,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It's created by a company called Enway, based out of Seoul.

999
01:32:16,654 --> 01:32:19,696
[SPEAKER_04]: And they previously, before this, developed Power Rangers-related games.

1000
01:32:19,736 --> 01:32:21,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know specifically which ones.

1001
01:32:21,817 --> 01:32:25,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a PC version of the game, too, on the Epic Games Store.

1002
01:32:25,759 --> 01:32:29,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it has a really cheap DDR-looking mode, but I'm sure it plays...

1003
01:32:30,981 --> 01:32:35,843
[SPEAKER_04]: probably like the Commodore 64 version of Summer Games played, which was a good game then in 1984.

1004
01:32:38,124 --> 01:32:40,405
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there's NFTs in the game.

1005
01:32:40,746 --> 01:32:54,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, on the game's website, olympicsgo.enway.com, join the excitement of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 with Enway's officially licensed Commemorative Paris 2024 NFT digital pin collection.

1006
01:32:55,432 --> 01:32:57,353
[SPEAKER_04]: You can claim a legendary or epic pin.

1007
01:32:58,113 --> 01:32:59,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not reading the rest of it because we all know this is...

1008
01:33:02,383 --> 01:33:07,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Be sure to have an ETH L2-based supported wallet to secure yours today.

1009
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:11,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I left mine in my Skibidibi toilet.

1010
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1011
01:33:15,893 --> 01:33:23,758
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell that the IOC got conned a couple of years ago when everybody thought NFTs were going to be the fucking next big thing.

1012
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:25,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And here they are.

1013
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:29,631
[SPEAKER_04]: holding it out, being hung out to dry.

1014
01:33:30,092 --> 01:33:31,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what's going to make more money?

1015
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:34,655
[SPEAKER_04]: This or Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games?

1016
01:33:36,037 --> 01:33:40,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're going to be crying very sad, sad, bitter tears.

1017
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:48,427
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in chat says those NFTs are going to fail and then the IOC will want to go back to Sega, who I hope asks for more money.

1018
01:33:49,408 --> 01:33:49,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1019
01:33:53,311 --> 01:33:54,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's move on, DarkSakura.

1020
01:33:59,018 --> 01:34:02,340
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had some news.

1021
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say much news.

1022
01:34:05,822 --> 01:34:14,447
[SPEAKER_07]: But Humble Games has actually done one last release before they're doing a restructuring.

1023
01:34:16,138 --> 01:34:43,655
[SPEAKER_07]: they were doing this they had released Bow Path of the Teal Lotus and they have a Patreon to support the game quote in these uncertain times the developer SquidShock said that they didn't fault any of the team's work but Humble's changes have meant this is a quote here we have missed out on critical post-launch support which may put our studio's future at risk

1024
01:34:44,575 --> 01:34:46,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I went ahead and just bought the game at full price just now.

1025
01:34:47,436 --> 01:34:51,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just now, but earlier today, so I can make sure that I got it.

1026
01:34:52,457 --> 01:35:04,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But also within hours of Humble's post, they said that, and this is another quote, lost access to the pipeline of critical systems without warning.

1027
01:35:05,401 --> 01:35:08,642
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still managing the game on Steam, and they were able to get a patch out.

1028
01:35:08,722 --> 01:35:10,543
[SPEAKER_07]: They cannot say the same for consoles.

1029
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:15,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Humble's kind of screwing them over.

1030
01:35:17,999 --> 01:35:20,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't think intentionally, but still.

1031
01:35:24,358 --> 01:35:25,419
[SPEAKER_07]: They go on further on their post.

1032
01:35:25,479 --> 01:35:27,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, despite this, our launch was not without its challenges.

1033
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:32,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Our publisher shutting down has meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support.

1034
01:35:32,242 --> 01:35:32,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I just said that.

1035
01:35:33,583 --> 01:35:38,986
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make it crystal clear this is in no way the fault of the Humble Games team we worked with.

1036
01:35:39,086 --> 01:35:42,228
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a sad time in the industry and ultimately we understand.

1037
01:35:43,269 --> 01:35:47,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are working on helping restore access to console versions.

1038
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:57,175
[SPEAKER_07]: This comes also after 36 Humble Games employees were laid off.

1039
01:36:00,117 --> 01:36:01,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I don't know.

1040
01:36:02,478 --> 01:36:03,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of things to say.

1041
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:06,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I warned at the top of the show, the news isn't pleasant this week.

1042
01:36:06,681 --> 01:36:08,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not going to lie, y'all.

1043
01:36:09,142 --> 01:36:16,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it really hard to have an enthusiast show when there really isn't anything to get enthusiastic about these days.

1044
01:36:17,006 --> 01:36:18,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I should say few and far between.

1045
01:36:18,971 --> 01:36:26,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering where Humble is losing money as a predominantly charitable... Weren't they originally just a charitable company?

1046
01:36:27,453 --> 01:36:33,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they were purchased by IGN, but it's not Humble Bundle, it's Humble Games that shut down their publishing arm.

1047
01:36:35,074 --> 01:36:42,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, but even so, I'm wondering how much actual financial support that aspect of it gets.

1048
01:36:42,656 --> 01:36:43,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1049
01:36:45,001 --> 01:36:48,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd really, that's what I kind of want to reserve a little bit of judgment for.

1050
01:36:49,543 --> 01:36:58,108
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, it seemed like this also might have been something that might have been trying to fight against.

1051
01:36:58,128 --> 01:37:03,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they were saying, one of their representatives had said that they were just restructuring but not shutting down.

1052
01:37:03,811 --> 01:37:09,113
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of their former employees are saying that it might be the opposite, that it might actually be shutting down.

1053
01:37:09,134 --> 01:37:09,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1054
01:37:11,383 --> 01:37:15,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, would you say that we are coming up on our next big crash?

1055
01:37:16,513 --> 01:37:18,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't I get into this about six months ago?

1056
01:37:19,014 --> 01:37:25,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you're saying what I did say when we were talking about a lot of these layoffs.

1057
01:37:25,397 --> 01:37:28,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I said I feel like, yeah, this is a form.

1058
01:37:28,338 --> 01:37:34,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same thing because I think I mentioned – I wish I remember what episode number that was because I'd love to go back and listen to it.

1059
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:39,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't love to listen to old episodes of this show oftentimes because we don't always get it right.

1060
01:37:40,062 --> 01:37:42,483
[SPEAKER_04]: But that one I'd love to go back and listen to because –

1061
01:37:44,574 --> 01:38:11,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking about the crash of 84 and it's different this time because we're buoyed up by indie games and we still will always kind of have that but I do feel like there is a big bubble that is bursting that is very reminiscent of the crash of 84 in some ways and too many people thinking they can cash in a big dollar I mean maybe it's not Atari 2600 cartridges but it's $70 video games or games with battle passes out the wazoo that there's too many cooks in the kitchen and it's causing the bubble to burst

1062
01:38:12,874 --> 01:38:14,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a little bit more to it.

1063
01:38:14,275 --> 01:38:23,959
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also coming right out of the post-COVID shutdown where basically video games were what people had to do.

1064
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:28,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and especially for a lot of the online community-based games.

1065
01:38:28,721 --> 01:38:32,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we saw... I mean, I know I've said this before.

1066
01:38:32,262 --> 01:38:35,424
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it wasn't on purpose, but damn Animal Crossing came out at the right time.

1067
01:38:36,584 --> 01:38:38,625
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but now people...

1068
01:38:39,978 --> 01:38:45,942
[SPEAKER_07]: are basically going out and I mean, pardon me for saying they're going out and touching their grass and breathing the air.

1069
01:38:46,603 --> 01:38:47,983
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're doing things.

1070
01:38:48,023 --> 01:38:49,685
[SPEAKER_07]: They're working not from home.

1071
01:38:49,765 --> 01:38:53,227
[SPEAKER_07]: They're able, you know, we've built up more immunity.

1072
01:38:53,267 --> 01:38:56,909
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got more people vaccinated, even though there are still idiots out there who won't do it.

1073
01:38:58,671 --> 01:39:07,857
[SPEAKER_07]: But overall, we have people re-engaging with society in ways that don't involve something that would have you at home to do.

1074
01:39:08,817 --> 01:39:09,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

1075
01:39:10,098 --> 01:39:35,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean introverts like me we're like yeah more games please please please but not everyone's like that and I think it's coming along with that massive social change but I mean but that's not to say that there isn't a you know a more widespread economy issue going on because we're also I saw on the Verve not long ago that Intel laid off 15,000 people

1076
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:41,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just double check that real quick.

1077
01:39:41,551 --> 01:39:48,732
[SPEAKER_04]: While you're saying that, I just want to say I think another big contributor to this whole thing too is what we were just talking about in the previous story.

1078
01:39:49,032 --> 01:39:57,493
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry getting suckered by these ridiculous ideas like NFT, crypto, and what that was going to do for the industry.

1079
01:39:57,933 --> 01:40:05,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Companies are getting suckered by what that is going to do into a false bottom line that gamers as a whole have rightfully rejected.

1080
01:40:05,675 --> 01:40:07,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And next on the chopping block is stolen...

1081
01:40:12,618 --> 01:40:22,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're gonna eventually start understanding that we are also a more aware society.

1082
01:40:24,924 --> 01:40:49,507
[SPEAKER_07]: and whether or not you know they want to see us as being in our own little community bubbles we have our fingers out there and we see and most of you know we grow up with the technology and we're seeing also more I would say younger gamers also thinking in terms of where this works in the real world being more socially conscious with with what they're doing with their money and what they're spending it on.

1083
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:52,852
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I found what I was looking at.

1084
01:40:52,972 --> 01:41:00,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Intel is laying off 15,000 employees and is stopping, quote, non-essential work.

1085
01:41:03,294 --> 01:41:06,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're also looking that there could be more layoffs than that.

1086
01:41:06,755 --> 01:41:07,795
[SPEAKER_07]: They're reducing R&D.

1087
01:41:07,815 --> 01:41:13,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, so basically a lot of tech companies are cutting out some of their innovation too.

1088
01:41:13,816 --> 01:41:15,637
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that...

1089
01:41:16,986 --> 01:41:20,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to switch gears for just a second.

1090
01:41:21,687 --> 01:41:32,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that these companies, the people who are making the decisions about them, don't understand the technology that they're making the decision about.

1091
01:41:34,935 --> 01:42:04,032
[SPEAKER_07]: like boardroom CEO says oh NFTs are the big thing I see the theory of this let's put it into practice without having any real world evidence of how it's actually going to work or how how people feel about it you know they're just like oh this is new it innovates it sets us apart let's do it when in reality it sets you apart in the wrong way it it sets one apart the way that um

1092
01:42:05,402 --> 01:42:11,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Having a highly contagious illness sets you apart from society.

1093
01:42:11,487 --> 01:42:14,909
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to stay locked up at home because no one wants to get sick either.

1094
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:17,071
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want that happening to them.

1095
01:42:19,352 --> 01:42:26,998
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really think, or I think that maybe somebody on the floor has a good idea and it might involve one of those technologies.

1096
01:42:27,098 --> 01:42:33,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they explain this to the non-tech oriented person who deals only with money and the company,

1097
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:42,832
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, they're not going to really understand it and just say, oh, this can make money instead of, oh, we need to put all this work in it to implement it.

1098
01:42:44,569 --> 01:42:45,290
[SPEAKER_04]: You're back, Loki.

1099
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:46,090
[SPEAKER_04]: We got you.

1100
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, internet hiccup and then Discord's like, I'm confused.

1101
01:42:50,093 --> 01:42:51,054
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, you're good.

1102
01:42:51,674 --> 01:42:52,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, DarkSakura.

1103
01:42:53,455 --> 01:42:54,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you heard what I had to say.

1104
01:42:55,096 --> 01:42:55,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

1105
01:42:55,917 --> 01:43:10,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did want to read this comment from SSJ100Mad as well that says, I think where it landed was that this crash will be more like a cooling where we would say fewer and fewer AAA games because the cost to make those games is so high and that we'll see more remakes in between those releases.

1106
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:11,468
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,

1107
01:43:12,248 --> 01:43:14,290
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1108
01:43:30,009 --> 01:43:30,549
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

1109
01:44:00,429 --> 01:44:27,022
[SPEAKER_04]: otherwise they tend to resist a lot of the big trends online fucking there's no friends leaderboard in Nintendo World Championships which is redonkulous but their resistance to things like NFTs, AI they're resisting a lot of this stuff within Nintendo and so it's going to be very I feel like the Switch 2 is going to come out at a very interesting time in gaming

1110
01:44:28,143 --> 01:44:29,904
[SPEAKER_04]: or Nintendo could really run away with it.

1111
01:44:30,425 --> 01:44:34,327
[SPEAKER_04]: If they have the right lineup that's solid.

1112
01:44:34,427 --> 01:44:37,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that thing's going to be a hit almost no matter what.

1113
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:41,472
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, this could be a real record breaker.

1114
01:44:42,133 --> 01:44:42,513
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1115
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:42,993
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1116
01:44:44,834 --> 01:44:45,855
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

1117
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:48,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to our next story, Loki.

1118
01:44:48,677 --> 01:44:51,519
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't talked about Microsoft a lot tonight.

1119
01:44:51,599 --> 01:44:52,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So sure, let's talk about them.

1120
01:44:53,376 --> 01:45:00,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Microsoft and Activision are creating a brand new Splinter Studio.

1121
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to focus on AA development.

1122
01:45:03,461 --> 01:45:12,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess when they were talking about all those smaller indie games that are successful that they then laid off studios for, they're now creating a studio to make those games.

1123
01:45:13,126 --> 01:45:13,927
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that makes sense.

1124
01:45:15,448 --> 01:45:30,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, apparently, according to sources reported by Windows Central, indicate that Microsoft and Activision have approved the creation of a new team with its Blizzard subsidiary comprised mostly of employees from King.

1125
01:45:32,299 --> 01:45:41,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're told that Microsoft and Activision's new team within Blizzard is tasked to work on AA smaller games based on existing franchises within the Blizzard universes.

1126
01:45:42,888 --> 01:45:56,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Given that King is focused on mobile games, it's possible that these will be mobile games aimed to support the Xbox mobile gaming store on iOS and Android that's supposed to be upcoming.

1127
01:45:57,572 --> 01:46:02,594
[SPEAKER_03]: But not necessarily certain that they'll be specifically mobile.

1128
01:46:02,894 --> 01:46:05,775
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be expanded to other things other than mobile as well.

1129
01:46:07,011 --> 01:46:30,849
[SPEAKER_03]: so interesting i guess um i don't think this is gonna be as significant as like say another uh hi-fi rush or something like that because it's we're talking sounds like smaller projects but yeah it's disappointing to see them kind of exchange good studios for i mean this is probably a decent studio but the projects sound less uh exciting

1130
01:46:35,003 --> 01:46:37,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll be interested to see what they kind of come up with.

1131
01:46:37,444 --> 01:46:39,966
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is kind of what you said there at the beginning, Loki.

1132
01:46:39,986 --> 01:46:41,967
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little weird to see them creating a new studio.

1133
01:46:42,187 --> 01:46:46,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand there's, you know, with the mobile and everything, it's different sort of things at play.

1134
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:49,151
[SPEAKER_04]: But the optics of that are just so weird, right?

1135
01:46:49,411 --> 01:46:54,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it feels like stuff that, like... I'd rather they do this than close a different studio, I guess.

1136
01:46:54,554 --> 01:46:55,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah.

1137
01:46:55,254 --> 01:46:59,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but... Like Fallout Shelter or something like that, you know?

1138
01:47:00,217 --> 01:47:02,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that would be pretty cool, but... Eh.

1139
01:47:03,803 --> 01:47:30,093
[SPEAKER_04]: they already they did do a Warcraft mobile game recently um and I wasn't very into it Warcraft Rumble I think it's called I wasn't into it it feels very dated it felt like a cell phone game that would have come out it was like I think it was like a tower defense game and I was like this feels like something would come out 10 years ago so talking about things that are behind the curve I just I wasn't really into it but I know people that are and there's nothing wrong with just because I don't like it doesn't mean you don't have to just wasn't my cup of tea

1140
01:47:31,496 --> 01:47:32,757
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

1141
01:47:32,777 --> 01:47:34,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo World Championships.

1142
01:47:34,597 --> 01:47:41,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been playing a little bit on my Switch, probably more than about any other game, because I do love a little dose of retro every now and then.

1143
01:47:42,681 --> 01:47:58,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting scenario that's happened is that the top of the leaderboard for one of the recent challenges in Nintendo World Championships, and even though you can't see how your friends rank, you can see a recording of the top score.

1144
01:47:59,429 --> 01:48:00,389
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1145
01:48:18,837 --> 01:48:19,657
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1146
01:48:44,406 --> 01:48:55,469
[SPEAKER_04]: If you play Donkey Kong Classics, I think it's called, which was the first two games combined in one cartridge, you can go down the first ladder and you can beat the first board very quick.

1147
01:48:56,949 --> 01:49:00,970
[SPEAKER_04]: If you try to do that in Nintendo World Championships, the game rewinds.

1148
01:49:01,370 --> 01:49:01,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It triggers.

1149
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:09,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes, can't go that way, as it does in some of the other challenges when you try to go way too far off track, which is an interesting feature in and of itself.

1150
01:49:10,672 --> 01:49:24,768
[SPEAKER_04]: um so you can't use that glitch but this one for every reason you can and I didn't know about this glitch before um so maybe this is the first time Nintendo uh learned about it too I'm not sure but that was an interesting thing to see

1151
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:31,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Also interesting when it comes to Nintendo World Championships is one of the names that's in the credits.

1152
01:49:31,755 --> 01:49:37,019
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the credits for the game under Program Support, you see the name Tomohiro Kawase.

1153
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:43,845
[SPEAKER_04]: You might not recognize that name as much as you would some of the other names around Nintendo, but you should put some respect on that name because...

1154
01:49:44,875 --> 01:49:45,696
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1155
01:50:11,614 --> 01:50:14,116
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course the GBA Classic NES series.

1156
01:50:14,296 --> 01:50:17,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So he got a shout out in Nintendo World Championships.

1157
01:50:17,979 --> 01:50:25,786
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been reported previously that this individual got a break with Nintendo after working on unofficial emulators.

1158
01:50:26,967 --> 01:50:30,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of interesting how he came a long way.

1159
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:32,331
[SPEAKER_04]: So very cool.

1160
01:50:33,312 --> 01:50:37,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, speaking of classic games, we've got a segment to get to.

1161
01:50:37,495 --> 01:50:38,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's roll the bumper.

1162
01:50:48,965 --> 01:50:56,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1163
01:50:56,733 --> 01:50:59,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1164
01:51:00,017 --> 01:51:07,304
[SPEAKER_04]: But once a month here on the program in the year 2024, DarkSakura picks a canceled game to talk about.

1165
01:51:07,665 --> 01:51:10,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura, what is the canceled game of the month?

1166
01:51:11,684 --> 01:51:14,366
[SPEAKER_07]: The canceled game is StarCraft Ghost.

1167
01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:22,872
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a military science fiction stealth action video game that was to be published.

1168
01:51:23,252 --> 01:51:24,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, it was developed by Blizzard.

1169
01:51:25,114 --> 01:51:27,315
[SPEAKER_07]: It was supposed to be part of StarCraft.

1170
01:51:27,415 --> 01:51:30,197
[SPEAKER_07]: It was announced on September 20th, 2002.

1171
01:51:31,538 --> 01:51:36,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Developed by Nihilistic Software for GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 consoles.

1172
01:51:38,395 --> 01:51:39,636
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a lot of delays.

1173
01:51:40,877 --> 01:51:45,580
[SPEAKER_07]: There were development transferred.

1174
01:51:46,581 --> 01:51:47,281
[SPEAKER_07]: There was stuff.

1175
01:51:47,502 --> 01:51:48,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there was stuff.

1176
01:51:49,323 --> 01:51:55,308
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll go ahead and start with what the game is.

1177
01:51:56,088 --> 01:52:05,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So you play a character named Nova, and instead of this being a real-time strategy like the previous, like the first StarCraft, this is a...

1178
01:52:06,136 --> 01:52:06,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of Metal Gear-ish.

1179
01:52:07,037 --> 01:52:08,538
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stealth tactical action.

1180
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,261
[SPEAKER_07]: You play as Nova.

1181
01:52:11,341 --> 01:52:17,246
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a cloaking device that allows you to be concealed, but some characters can find you.

1182
01:52:17,827 --> 01:52:23,873
[SPEAKER_07]: You also have thermal imaging goggles and EMPs and different types of guns to shoot at people.

1183
01:52:25,654 --> 01:52:29,978
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it was a lot of just, you know...

1184
01:52:31,079 --> 01:52:31,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Adventure-y stuff.

1185
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:43,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Nova has a lot of athletic abilities, ziplining and hanging from pipes, and also psionic powers.

1186
01:52:44,784 --> 01:52:45,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she's a ghost agent.

1187
01:52:46,864 --> 01:52:51,126
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a lot of vehicles that were in StarCraft and StarCraft Brood War.

1188
01:52:53,807 --> 01:52:55,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Some were support, some you could use yourself.

1189
01:52:56,468 --> 01:52:58,428
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a multiplayer mode.

1190
01:53:00,445 --> 01:53:20,628
[SPEAKER_07]: that uh you have like a personal view of some of the RTS strategies uh from the earlier games there was Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill stuff like that um an invasion mode where two teams are fighting for control of mineral resources so um

1191
01:53:22,441 --> 01:53:23,102
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

1192
01:53:49,546 --> 01:53:55,032
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get a little bit more into the development and the cancellation.

1193
01:53:56,173 --> 01:54:03,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So they had a lot of positive reaction from the press when they...

1194
01:54:05,411 --> 01:54:29,426
[SPEAKER_07]: made the announcement for it it was supposed to be out in late 2003 but there were delays and as of third quarter 2004 Nihilistic stopped working on it and they had completed what they had been contract for but in the game would still be delivered on time and then they started working Blizzard that is started working with Swing and Ape Studios and then bought the company also in May 2005 and

1195
01:54:31,387 --> 01:54:33,169
[SPEAKER_07]: but Ghost was delayed again.

1196
01:54:33,989 --> 01:54:47,500
[SPEAKER_07]: At E3 2005, Ghost was officially re-announced but the GameCube version was cancelled because of a lack of online support and then it was delayed again until 2006.

1197
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:53,504
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a booth for it at E3 that year.

1198
01:54:56,146 --> 01:54:56,927
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, they

1199
01:54:58,124 --> 01:55:03,910
[SPEAKER_07]: They kept postponing it until they were going to put it on newer consoles.

1200
01:55:05,071 --> 01:55:09,816
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they suspended the development again.

1201
01:55:10,837 --> 01:55:14,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when the novel came out a few months later in November 2006.

1202
01:55:16,523 --> 01:55:38,197
[SPEAKER_07]: so Blizzard Cinematics team that worked on Starcraft's cutscenes did cutscenes for Ghost's single player campaign and then they went from a team of 6 to 25 and used newer hardware newer stuff that were much higher quality and they had released a trailer in August 2005 and

1203
01:55:41,099 --> 01:55:51,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Nova, who is the protagonist of this game, also shows up in a campaign mission for StarCraft II, Wings of Liberty, where you can side with her or fight against her.

1204
01:55:51,885 --> 01:55:57,608
[SPEAKER_07]: She's also in Heart of the Swarm and then her own campaign in StarCraft II, Nova Covert Ops.

1205
01:56:00,410 --> 01:56:06,595
[SPEAKER_07]: So she's been certainly going on through the StarCraft universe.

1206
01:56:06,615 --> 01:56:11,339
[SPEAKER_07]: She's established now, but we're still not seeing the games.

1207
01:56:11,899 --> 01:56:22,748
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the DICE Summit in 2008, in the presentation, they had listed games canceled by Blizzard and it did not include Ghosts.

1208
01:56:24,485 --> 01:56:52,964
[SPEAKER_07]: but their co-founder said that the title had never been technically cancelled it just wasn't their focus and they were putting a lot of that more on the success of World of Warcraft and working on StarCraft 2 was taking their resources however despite all that everyone was like yeah this is vaporware we ain't having it and in fact the game ranked 5th in 2005's Wired News Annual Vaporware Awards

1209
01:56:54,285 --> 01:57:02,351
[SPEAKER_07]: On September 23rd, 2014, Polygon interviewed Blizzard about Titan.

1210
01:57:03,572 --> 01:57:07,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that time, they confirmed that StarCraft Ghost was cancelled.

1211
01:57:08,396 --> 01:57:17,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And with a quote, it was hard when we cancelled Warcraft Adventures, it was hard when we cancelled StarCraft Ghost, but it has always resulted in better quality work.

1212
01:57:19,765 --> 01:57:20,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jamie.

1213
01:57:20,465 --> 01:57:28,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to point out a strong irony about that comment because Titan ultimately got canceled too, but then, of course, kind of sort of turned into Recycle This Overwatch.

1214
01:57:28,789 --> 01:57:29,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's very interesting.

1215
01:57:33,751 --> 01:57:40,454
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2016, in a Polygon article, they basically were...

1216
01:57:41,778 --> 01:57:46,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Just thinking they could put it out on a different console or keep doing better and better to it, but then, wow.

1217
01:57:48,005 --> 01:57:51,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this takes us to more modern times in 2020.

1218
01:57:53,490 --> 01:57:53,810
[SPEAKER_07]: January 2020.

1219
01:57:54,111 --> 01:58:05,821
[SPEAKER_07]: There were videos from the Xbox version appearing online and lots of videos showing different missions, gameplay, different areas.

1220
01:58:06,522 --> 01:58:13,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Those all were uploaded and there was a rumor of the Xbox development version game files being linked.

1221
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:15,550
[SPEAKER_07]: So

1222
01:58:17,572 --> 01:58:32,112
[SPEAKER_07]: there are different journalists that did verify the legitimacy of this code that was disseminated online and there were infringement notices that went out but I mean basically people got them you know

1223
01:58:33,553 --> 01:58:38,956
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a playable though unfinished game, as we're seeing now.

1224
01:58:39,536 --> 01:58:47,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And also a version of Warcraft Adventures Lord of the Clans had been leaked earlier in September 2016.

1225
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:51,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And so with this, basically...

1226
01:58:55,722 --> 01:59:19,715
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a game that looked like it could have been really great I might have even had some interest in playing this game it really looked that level of fun it had been on my radar for a hot minute but at this point all we have is this playable footage and videos online and that's really it R.I.P.

1227
01:59:20,216 --> 01:59:22,337
[SPEAKER_07]: StarCraft Ghost you are now a ghost

1228
01:59:24,025 --> 01:59:24,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy Halloween!

1229
01:59:24,806 --> 01:59:26,008
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess Nova lives on?

1230
01:59:39,898 --> 02:00:08,687
[SPEAKER_04]: most other companies at this point probably would have pulled the plug and decommissioned Heroes of the Storm the way that Blizzard is kind of like not doing anything with it these days I will say to Blizzard's credit at least it's still going and the servers are still on and that's longer than most games you know in its similar state would hopefully it continues on at some point but yeah apparently I just learned that there is a Nova skin for Widowmaker in Overwatch there is yeah yeah yeah

1231
02:00:09,414 --> 02:00:10,054
[SPEAKER_04]: which is pretty cool.

1232
02:00:11,435 --> 02:00:15,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It is at least nice to see Blizzard sort of like, you know, tip the hat and nod.

1233
02:00:15,697 --> 02:00:18,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like StarCraft She's in another book too, I think.

1234
02:00:18,819 --> 02:00:24,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and I also feel like, you know, we've had Diablo 4, we have a new Warcraft expansion.

1235
02:00:25,482 --> 02:00:31,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the words StarCraft 3 because Blizzard isn't allergic to the number 3 like some companies.

1236
02:00:32,806 --> 02:00:36,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the word StarCraft 3 could happen from Blizzard

1237
02:00:37,873 --> 02:00:39,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in the next couple of years.

1238
02:00:39,294 --> 02:00:40,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be realistic.

1239
02:00:40,074 --> 02:00:41,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard takes some time to make games.

1240
02:00:41,394 --> 02:00:45,716
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel like StarCraft 3 would be like the next big thing on the horizon.

1241
02:00:46,676 --> 02:00:54,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Bonds006 says, I played Heroes of the Storm all day today.

1242
02:00:54,199 --> 02:00:54,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing wrong with that.

1243
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:55,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun game.

1244
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:56,540
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great game.

1245
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:02,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to play classic and retro games too that aren't supported by the company so well anymore.

1246
02:01:03,243 --> 02:01:03,683
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's...

1247
02:01:04,403 --> 02:01:07,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed Heroes of the Storm because it didn't just have PvP, it had PvE.

1248
02:01:21,112 --> 02:01:21,632
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1249
02:01:51,603 --> 02:02:14,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if any of the ones that were on my list are things that people are curious about that would expect me to and I've got a few honorable mentions that I could do but I think I have my list pretty well set I'll send it to you and I'll see what you think alright

1250
02:02:16,267 --> 02:02:17,068
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one.

1251
02:02:17,108 --> 02:02:17,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1252
02:02:39,791 --> 02:02:45,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sony announced that they have a limited edition Astro Bot controller that's going to be coming out for the PlayStation 5.

1253
02:02:47,154 --> 02:02:49,495
[SPEAKER_03]: $80 coming out on September 6th.

1254
02:02:50,256 --> 02:02:51,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks cute.

1255
02:02:51,116 --> 02:02:55,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the eyes on the touchpad itself, which it's confusing.

1256
02:02:55,738 --> 02:02:59,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're animated, but in the video they are animated.

1257
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:01,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So who knows?

1258
02:03:01,241 --> 02:03:02,881
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's cute.

1259
02:03:02,901 --> 02:03:03,642
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a robot.

1260
02:03:04,742 --> 02:03:05,502
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's your thing.

1261
02:03:06,623 --> 02:03:06,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1262
02:03:07,867 --> 02:03:13,231
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course we got news that Prison Architect 2 has been delayed indefinitely.

1263
02:03:13,632 --> 02:03:31,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to come out here very soon but I guess there's some stuff going on at Paradox Interactive that has delayed the game and essentially they have refunded the pre-orders so that's good at least that that happened but it is no longer coming out September 3rd.

1264
02:03:33,608 --> 02:03:37,451
[SPEAKER_03]: They said they need more time to improve both the game's performance and its content.

1265
02:03:38,348 --> 02:03:44,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, snaps for not releasing a half-assed product and taking the time to get it right and refunding.

1266
02:03:44,372 --> 02:03:46,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, how often do you hear that headline?

1267
02:03:47,134 --> 02:03:47,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Not very often.

1268
02:03:47,894 --> 02:03:48,655
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not very often.

1269
02:03:49,535 --> 02:03:49,996
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

1270
02:03:51,817 --> 02:03:54,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Nintendo is also feeling the burn.

1271
02:03:55,379 --> 02:03:58,301
[SPEAKER_07]: We were saying things are going industry-wide, but their profits fell 55%.

1272
02:04:02,004 --> 02:04:03,605
[SPEAKER_07]: People are saving up for the Switch, too.

1273
02:04:05,971 --> 02:04:30,222
[SPEAKER_07]: but they also haven't had super big releases like you know how we had Tears of the Kingdom last year we haven't had like any big movies come out also to bolster that so it's stated that the Switch 2 or whatever it will be called would be released in early 2025 but you know again people are holding on yeah

1274
02:04:33,150 --> 02:04:52,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually talking to somebody very recently about the Nintendo Switch And somebody who's a big Nintendo fan and games a lot on the Nintendo Switch And even going like, even I'm getting exhausted, this other person Even I'm getting exhausted at how bad the Nintendo Switch runs newer games And how we keep losing features in games we shouldn't be losing features on Actually, you know what it was?

1275
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:57,808
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about the video game No Man's Sky Because we were talking about that a little bit and he actually told me As you do

1276
02:04:58,589 --> 02:05:02,616
[SPEAKER_04]: As I do sometimes, I'm not just a client, I'm also the president.

1277
02:05:03,798 --> 02:05:04,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Other way around.

1278
02:05:04,218 --> 02:05:09,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but my friend said, I'm actually afraid to get No Man's Sky on Switch.

1279
02:05:10,228 --> 02:05:12,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know it's not going to run well.

1280
02:05:13,632 --> 02:05:15,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I have friends that have No Man's Sky on Switch.

1281
02:05:15,393 --> 02:05:19,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, Dark, not to call you out, but Dark, don't you guys play it on Switch and I think it runs okay?

1282
02:05:19,596 --> 02:05:24,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think they down-res it so it runs on Switch better because it's a smaller resolution.

1283
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:27,102
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not necessarily a bad thing for that screen.

1284
02:05:27,502 --> 02:05:31,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But the long story short, that system is showing its age.

1285
02:05:31,685 --> 02:05:32,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not, and like, it's...

1286
02:05:34,367 --> 02:05:36,870
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's technologies are getting further.

1287
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:44,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he was also complaining that he was playing Octopath Traveler 2 on Switch, and it's stuttering.

1288
02:05:44,878 --> 02:05:45,779
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got problems.

1289
02:05:45,819 --> 02:05:53,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay, Octopath Traveler 2, even though it is a newer game, it's not exactly using new techniques in gaming animation.

1290
02:05:53,247 --> 02:05:55,789
[SPEAKER_04]: That game should run on a PlayStation 3, shouldn't it?

1291
02:05:56,370 --> 02:05:56,710
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1292
02:05:57,871 --> 02:06:00,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just interesting to hear that sort of perspective.

1293
02:06:00,572 --> 02:06:06,173
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think even the most hardcore Nintendo fans are like, yeah, y'all, it's time.

1294
02:06:06,933 --> 02:06:07,293
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time.

1295
02:06:07,653 --> 02:06:08,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you in chat.

1296
02:06:08,994 --> 02:06:09,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Mish in chat.

1297
02:06:09,794 --> 02:06:13,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Mish says, it honestly doesn't run that bad on Switch.

1298
02:06:13,955 --> 02:06:15,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dark Dispute says, yeah, it wasn't terrible.

1299
02:06:15,475 --> 02:06:17,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did the resolution workaround to do that.

1300
02:06:18,656 --> 02:06:18,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1301
02:06:19,016 --> 02:06:22,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Entertainment with a much better quote saying, I'm not just an addict, I'm also a dealer.

1302
02:06:22,977 --> 02:06:23,337
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1303
02:06:24,097 --> 02:06:30,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Ranmari in chat says, some devs just don't optimize well for their target platform.

1304
02:06:30,783 --> 02:06:40,171
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it isn't in our headlines tonight, but there was one developer out there who made a pretty open comment this week about, why would we bother with the Xbox version?

1305
02:06:40,211 --> 02:06:42,313
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's playing on Xbox.

1306
02:06:42,513 --> 02:06:44,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a Japanese developer who said it, of course.

1307
02:06:45,236 --> 02:06:48,499
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically it was like, why are we bothering optimizing for Xbox?

1308
02:06:48,599 --> 02:06:49,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's playing on Xbox.

1309
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:49,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1310
02:06:56,877 --> 02:07:02,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I really worry about how Pokemon Legends ZA is going to run on the Switch.

1311
02:07:02,682 --> 02:07:06,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, valid AF for that game.

1312
02:07:06,805 --> 02:07:12,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if that game comes out before a Switch successor, I have concerns.

1313
02:07:14,511 --> 02:07:15,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

1314
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:24,722
[SPEAKER_04]: BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I mean, all you have to do is, in Unity, go to File, Compile As, Switch, and boom!

1315
02:07:25,062 --> 02:07:25,982
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your Switch port.

1316
02:07:26,162 --> 02:07:26,902
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that easy.

1317
02:07:27,683 --> 02:07:28,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Loki?

1318
02:07:28,503 --> 02:07:30,323
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get a Pixel Poops 2 on Switch, right?

1319
02:07:30,343 --> 02:07:37,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Just open it up in Unity, turn up the graphics on level 3, and then do File, Save As, Switch, right?

1320
02:07:37,845 --> 02:07:40,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sort of.

1321
02:07:40,385 --> 02:07:48,287
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to get a wrapper that's an NES emulator that they have used for other Nesmicry games, so it is possible.

1322
02:07:48,427 --> 02:07:49,807
[SPEAKER_04]: You make it sound too hard.

1323
02:07:53,468 --> 02:07:54,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

1324
02:07:54,948 --> 02:07:55,208
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1325
02:07:57,169 --> 02:07:57,429
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1326
02:07:58,629 --> 02:07:59,209
[SPEAKER_10]: You said hard.

1327
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:04,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1328
02:08:06,914 --> 02:08:07,695
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1329
02:08:28,968 --> 02:08:30,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have to?

1330
02:08:30,249 --> 02:08:33,651
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw one on the road on the way to the convention last week.

1331
02:08:34,792 --> 02:08:35,753
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you throw at it?

1332
02:08:35,893 --> 02:08:38,655
[SPEAKER_04]: In your imagination because you would never actually do that.

1333
02:08:39,956 --> 02:08:41,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, here's why I want to bring it up.

1334
02:08:42,598 --> 02:08:51,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a new DLC pack in Fortnite called the Summer Road Trip Bundle and you get to drive a Tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite, Rocket League, blah blah blah.

1335
02:08:52,065 --> 02:08:55,848
[SPEAKER_04]: But, just like the real thing, it was glitched.

1336
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:57,722
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1337
02:09:09,229 --> 02:09:13,690
[SPEAKER_04]: which if you're using the Cybertruck in Fortnite, you kind of deserve to be rendered completely useless.

1338
02:09:14,110 --> 02:09:25,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually using this whole story to bring up this kind of side thing I've actually heard that's really funny, which apparently there are lots of Fortnite people that are banding together to create this unofficial, unspoken word.

1339
02:09:26,572 --> 02:09:30,973
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the people in the game, all 100 people in the game are in a truce.

1340
02:09:30,993 --> 02:09:34,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I should say all 99 people in the game are in a truce.

1341
02:09:35,174 --> 02:09:38,795
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see somebody with a Cybertruck, they get it first.

1342
02:09:40,481 --> 02:09:40,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1343
02:09:40,741 --> 02:09:40,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1344
02:10:07,228 --> 02:10:11,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, don't get addicted to the cosmetics in that game, Jamie.

1345
02:10:11,311 --> 02:10:13,533
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to take out another mortgage.

1346
02:10:14,954 --> 02:10:15,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1347
02:10:16,635 --> 02:10:18,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the ones I want.

1348
02:10:18,236 --> 02:10:20,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the Dragon Ariana Grande.

1349
02:10:20,497 --> 02:10:23,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is important aside from the Fortnite stuff.

1350
02:10:23,319 --> 02:10:24,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So the LEGO Fortnite stuff is pretty cool.

1351
02:10:24,941 --> 02:10:26,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, yeah.

1352
02:10:26,542 --> 02:10:29,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Cybertruck isn't in that, which already makes it better.

1353
02:10:30,444 --> 02:10:33,647
[SPEAKER_03]: LEGO Fortnite LEGO sets coming out in October.

1354

[SPEAKER_04]: The Animal Crossing LEGO sets Do you know what my husband sent me a picture of from Costco which sometimes dabbles in the LEGO stuff?

1356
02:10:44,898 --> 02:10:48,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Animal Crossing I don't know if I want

1357
02:10:50,546 --> 02:10:51,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I have so much stuff already.

1358
02:10:52,348 --> 02:10:55,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know Alan is so fucking funny.

1359
02:10:55,250 --> 02:10:58,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna show you this on my little... Actually, I can do this.

1360
02:10:58,853 --> 02:10:59,693
[SPEAKER_08]: You're cute!

1361
02:10:59,773 --> 02:11:01,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna do this shot real quick so you can see it.

1362
02:11:02,175 --> 02:11:03,136
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent me this thing.

1363
02:11:03,176 --> 02:11:05,438
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent me the Animal Crossing Legos, right?

1364
02:11:05,458 --> 02:11:10,562
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the set at Costco with the caption... Yeah, with the caption, I hate it here.

1365
02:11:13,364 --> 02:11:14,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I need that.

1366
02:11:15,646 --> 02:11:17,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, they're expensive.

1367
02:11:17,127 --> 02:11:19,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the sets, like the camping set is 80 bucks.

1368
02:11:21,653 --> 02:11:22,833
[SPEAKER_07]: The KK Concert one.

[SPEAKER_04]: That game has come out before.

1401
02:13:47,531 --> 02:13:49,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like another version of it.

1402
02:13:49,452 --> 02:13:52,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It's based on a manga?

1403
02:13:53,307 --> 02:13:54,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine.

1404
02:13:54,608 --> 02:13:57,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think it's an original to video games IP.

[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says it's an anime.

1407
02:14:06,398 --> 02:14:09,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is also one that's a thing, I guess.

1410

[SPEAKER_04]: ACAB includes Zombie Police.

1411
02:14:22,866 --> 02:14:26,208
[SPEAKER_03]: and then The Crush House on PC.

1412
02:14:26,588 --> 02:14:27,369
[SPEAKER_03]: That one looks pretty good.

1413
02:14:29,971 --> 02:14:30,291
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1414
02:14:30,711 --> 02:14:33,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the one that's the new game?

1415
02:14:33,273 --> 02:14:36,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Date Anything or Date Everything?

1416
02:14:37,076 --> 02:14:37,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1417
02:14:40,759 --> 02:14:42,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I love these dating games.

1418
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:43,621
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting crazier and crazier.

1419
02:14:44,326 --> 02:14:46,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I linked that one.

1420
02:14:46,348 --> 02:14:51,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Fixie told me about that one, and I linked it to Nick, and I think everyone's reaction was the same, like, what?

1421
02:14:52,132 --> 02:14:52,373
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1422
02:14:54,554 --> 02:14:56,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on.

1423
02:14:56,916 --> 02:14:58,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's travel to Japan, get in the car.

1424
02:14:59,498 --> 02:14:59,699
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1425
02:15:00,919 --> 02:15:02,881
[SPEAKER_04]: On August 8th, we actually have a lot of releases.

1426
02:15:02,921 --> 02:15:04,482
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all the Nintendo Switch.

1427
02:15:04,642 --> 02:15:04,962
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?

1428
02:15:05,543 --> 02:15:07,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Review Starlight, which Loki mentioned.

1429
02:15:08,244 --> 02:15:12,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanaimo, Kare, Tu, and Bloom comes out in a regular and special edition.

1430
02:15:13,388 --> 02:15:16,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Some Convenience Store comes out in a regular and limited edition.

1431
02:15:17,971 --> 02:15:22,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Rashomon of Shinjuku comes out in a regular and, you guessed it, special edition.

1432
02:15:23,095 --> 02:15:24,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Lost Epic is also out.

1433
02:15:25,256 --> 02:15:25,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Knights of Valor

1434
02:15:53,221 --> 02:15:55,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I thought that word is problematic.

1435
02:15:57,887 --> 02:16:05,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know of a word that they would have used 20 years ago that begins with O to describe Asian folks.

1436
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:10,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Agatha Christie's, yeah, I don't know.

1437
02:16:10,663 --> 02:16:10,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

1438
02:16:12,062 --> 02:16:15,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, if it's coming from, and I get the Christie novel, I think it's okay.

1439
02:16:15,563 --> 02:16:16,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, it's not.

1440
02:16:16,463 --> 02:16:16,783
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

1441
02:16:16,823 --> 02:16:19,924
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just trying to think of where, you know, I've heard that word used in pop culture.

1442
02:16:19,944 --> 02:16:24,825
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, that legend is coming out in that collection.

1443
02:16:25,025 --> 02:16:29,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Marshall Masters, Demon Front, and The Gladiator are all coming out.

1444
02:16:30,407 --> 02:16:35,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I wondered why it was a bad word when the other opposite is Occidental.

1445
02:16:37,296 --> 02:16:38,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1446
02:16:38,296 --> 02:16:42,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, if somebody tells me they don't like it, I do my best to adjust, I guess.

1447
02:16:42,537 --> 02:16:42,817
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1448
02:16:43,998 --> 02:16:50,339
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 5, we have Princess Maker 2 Regeneration, as well as Lost Epic.

1449
02:16:51,039 --> 02:16:55,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And that time I got reincarnated as a slime is all coming out in Japan.

1450
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:57,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So very similar sorts of things.

1451
02:16:57,581 --> 02:17:04,122
[SPEAKER_04]: But I should also point out the PlayStation VR 2 adapter for PC also gets a Japanese release this week, which is pretty cool.

1452
02:17:04,723 --> 02:17:04,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1453
02:17:06,343 --> 02:17:06,603
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1454
02:17:08,157 --> 02:17:17,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so in Europe, on the 6th for PlayStation and Xbox is Cygni, All Guns Blazing.

1455
02:17:17,665 --> 02:17:20,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of like the name of that because it makes me think of swans.

1456
02:17:20,607 --> 02:17:21,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Cygnus.

1457
02:17:23,230 --> 02:17:27,233
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 8th for Switch and PlayStation, we have Cat Quest 3.

1458
02:17:28,033 --> 02:17:28,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

1459
02:17:29,094 --> 02:17:29,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Ta-da!

1460
02:17:30,871 --> 02:17:37,934
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we have just a few headlines for you, and then we'll get to our email and whatever else might be in the listener roundtable tonight.

1461
02:17:38,414 --> 02:17:39,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, let's start with you.

1462
02:17:41,295 --> 02:17:50,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the creator of Resident Evil, Shinji Mikami, wants Suda51 to work on a new Killer7 game.

1463
02:17:52,199 --> 02:17:53,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a new Killer7 game.

1464
02:17:55,101 --> 02:17:55,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Game was weird.

1465
02:17:57,108 --> 02:17:58,349
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in, if you're lucky.

1466
02:18:25,356 --> 02:18:26,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the multiverse there.

1467
02:18:26,377 --> 02:18:27,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll see that.

1468
02:18:28,899 --> 02:18:30,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, cool.

1469
02:18:33,322 --> 02:18:37,426
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, yeah, I don't know.

1470
02:18:37,686 --> 02:18:42,910
[SPEAKER_03]: He says the complete edition which came out for Killer7 was kind of lame.

1471
02:18:43,710 --> 02:18:54,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said Suda51 disagreed, saying that the current version of Killer7 doesn't really speak, but was originally planned to have lots of dialogue.

1472
02:18:56,387 --> 02:18:58,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not too familiar with the complete edition.

1473
02:18:59,068 --> 02:19:01,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I played this originally when it came out on the PlayStation 2.

1474
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:07,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1475
02:19:09,211 --> 02:19:09,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, cool.

1476
02:19:10,151 --> 02:19:11,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hope they make another game.

1477
02:19:11,952 --> 02:19:15,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, though, since the original came out, was it 2005?

1478
02:19:16,253 --> 02:19:17,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not gonna happen.

1479
02:19:19,154 --> 02:19:19,434
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1480
02:19:20,868 --> 02:19:25,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, moving on here to the final story we have officially on the show world tonight.

1481
02:19:26,074 --> 02:19:28,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, some fucking good news.

1482
02:19:29,097 --> 02:19:30,739
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I think this is good news.

1483
02:19:30,799 --> 02:19:32,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody's going to... You would, right?

1484
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:37,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people may actually see this as bad news because they are about to lose a lot of evenings and weekends.

1485
02:19:38,527 --> 02:19:42,131
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is the Sid Meier's Civilization VII...

1486
02:19:43,072 --> 02:19:43,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Gameplay Showcase.

1487
02:19:44,033 --> 02:19:44,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that?

1488
02:19:44,473 --> 02:19:46,996
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually announced Civ 7 but they didn't show any gameplay yet.

1489
02:19:47,516 --> 02:19:54,783
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be showing gameplay on August 20th at 1 30 p.m and it has over 20 minutes of gameplay details.

1490
02:19:55,084 --> 02:19:58,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that means the game is probably due this holiday season.

1491
02:19:58,087 --> 02:20:06,555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be because right after that they're also going to be from August 21st to 25th if you are at gamescom.com

1492
02:20:07,115 --> 02:20:08,397
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play, Civilization.

1493
02:20:08,437 --> 02:20:09,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they don't say play.

1494
02:20:09,859 --> 02:20:13,322
[SPEAKER_04]: They just say stop by the Civ 7 booth located in Hall 6.

1495
02:20:13,843 --> 02:20:17,547
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to misspeak, but they'll be showing something there.

1496
02:20:18,368 --> 02:20:20,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And then August 31st at PAX...

1497
02:20:21,792 --> 02:20:26,578
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a dev panel where they will share new insights and behind the scenes anecdotes.

1498
02:20:27,058 --> 02:20:27,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

1499
02:20:27,799 --> 02:20:29,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually watch that live as well.

1500
02:20:29,581 --> 02:20:35,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe, I don't know, maybe it doesn't hit this year, but Civ 7 appears to be on the horizon pretty soon.

1501
02:20:35,588 --> 02:20:36,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is pretty cool.

1502
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:41,135
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really do hope Christopher Tin did the theme again this time because he did the theme for...

1503
02:20:42,216 --> 02:20:47,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Civ 4, which, you know, I think everybody knows Baba Yetu at this point because that got nominated for the Grammy and all that stuff.

1504
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:49,181
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he did the theme for 6, too.

1505
02:20:49,221 --> 02:20:51,723
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't do 5, but he did 6, which was really good, too.

1506
02:20:51,783 --> 02:20:53,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't really talked about enough.

1507
02:20:53,524 --> 02:20:56,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a really lovely song from Civ 6.

1508
02:20:56,926 --> 02:20:59,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I really hope he does the Civ 7 theme as well.

1509
02:20:59,929 --> 02:21:00,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1510
02:21:01,392 --> 02:21:02,173
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Rob.

1511
02:21:02,514 --> 02:21:02,694
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1512
02:21:03,034 --> 02:21:03,795
[SPEAKER_07]: To take a step back.

1513
02:21:04,115 --> 02:21:09,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I did because I'm that person that does my own research when I want to make sure I am not abusing any privilege.

1514
02:21:09,882 --> 02:21:10,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1515
02:21:10,622 --> 02:21:14,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently not everyone feels that it is, but enough people feel that it is offensive.

1516
02:21:15,027 --> 02:21:15,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1517
02:21:15,788 --> 02:21:18,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I remember that lady- As a title, it's one thing.

1518
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:21,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Using it as a term to describe somebody is a different thing.

1519
02:21:21,834 --> 02:21:22,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1520
02:21:22,595 --> 02:21:50,352
[SPEAKER_07]: and maybe that's where I'm mixing it up in my head because I know Lady Gaga got a lot of crap for using a variation of that word in one of her songs Born This Way and she actually changed it when she sings it live now so she changed the lyrics I know people who flat out refer to themselves that way so that's why I always want to make sure it's like me with people who are autistic some people prefer person first language and say person with autism which I don't like at all, don't use that around me but

1521
02:21:51,172 --> 02:21:54,073
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta talk to the person, use whatever they respect using.

1522
02:21:56,054 --> 02:22:01,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so let's move on and get to the listener roundtable and I'll just jump right to the emails.

1523
02:22:01,295 --> 02:22:08,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com where DarkSakura said she climbed into the mailbag and found one lone email to dust off and read.

1524
02:22:09,818 --> 02:22:11,199
[SPEAKER_07]: This came from Net Zero.

1525
02:22:11,879 --> 02:22:13,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, OLR crew.

1526
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:13,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the show.

1527
02:22:14,161 --> 02:22:17,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think AI will help speed up game development to yearly releases?

1528
02:22:18,384 --> 02:22:22,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think the Switch 2 will end up launching without a big lineup of games?

1529
02:22:24,028 --> 02:22:24,708
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all the email.

1530
02:22:25,128 --> 02:22:30,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I will go ahead and start off by saying it depends on what you mean by AI.

1531
02:22:30,112 --> 02:22:31,673
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's generative AI, fuck it.

1532
02:22:31,933 --> 02:22:32,994
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want that in our game.

1533
02:22:33,966 --> 02:22:44,916
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's using AI tools and assistance and having in-game AI for part of the program of the game and what makes the gameplay go, then...

1534
02:22:46,559 --> 02:22:50,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm okay with internal generative AI.

1535
02:22:50,523 --> 02:22:50,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1536
02:22:50,843 --> 02:22:51,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1537
02:23:09,102 --> 02:23:37,732
[SPEAKER_07]: or instead of generative AI I think they're also referring to AI tools like I will use some of the ones in Pixelmator like especially like a my brain is smart resolution I will use that for a few projects if I have to blow up an image and don't have anything else to go with AI coding tools I mean Bobby says AI coding tools are still generative AI I'm looking at

1538
02:23:39,315 --> 02:23:48,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Production level of assets versus... That's a semantic thing for right now in the context of how I'm referring to it.

1539
02:23:49,142 --> 02:24:00,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Things like voice actors and characters and if it's pulling from a non-in-company generated source, then I'm against it.

1540
02:24:00,831 --> 02:24:05,535
[SPEAKER_07]: If it is programmed by people, provided by people, paid content...

1541
02:24:06,275 --> 02:24:10,377
[SPEAKER_07]: to go into the database of those things, then yes, I'm cool with that.

1542
02:24:11,418 --> 02:24:14,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that's the point of what assistive AI is meant for.

1543
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:21,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to refer to them in those two different contexts for clarity.

1544
02:24:21,823 --> 02:24:25,345
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as a switch to launching without a big lineup of games, I don't know.

1545
02:24:26,445 --> 02:24:28,687
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to have something come out for it.

1546
02:24:29,287 --> 02:24:33,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you – well, first off, I don't think I've heard this emailer before, so thank you for emailing in.

1547
02:24:33,310 --> 02:24:34,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice to hear.

1548
02:24:34,171 --> 02:24:36,993
[SPEAKER_04]: We love to hear from our regulars, but we love to hear from new people too.

1549
02:24:37,493 --> 02:24:38,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for sending a message.

1550
02:24:39,175 --> 02:24:48,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I will actually say – because I think also the question about AI was is it going to – because I think basically yearly releases, I get the hint, is it going to cut down the production time of games?

1551
02:24:49,622 --> 02:25:14,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so but I think what it will do is as systems get what you know PlayStation 6 is on the horizon and someday in our lives of PlayStation 7 I think those sorts of tools that Jamie's talking about will help us get there but I don't think it reduces the cycle all the way down to a year I think it's still gonna but it also kind of depends on the game you know I

1552
02:25:15,154 --> 02:25:28,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the people who aren't in the thick of the technology thinks it's going to help but really I don't think it is and on top of that too as you were dealing with better graphic capability I want to say um

1553
02:25:30,623 --> 02:25:36,849
[SPEAKER_07]: These tools are only just going to help facilitate, I think, harder work if they do pan out the way people think that they do.

1554
02:25:37,409 --> 02:25:48,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's going to have to be that much more artistry put into the work that goes out, more assets to be designed, things like that.

1555
02:25:48,619 --> 02:25:52,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my take on that, is that it probably wouldn't...

1556
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:54,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it any better.

1557
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:56,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I think crunch time is always going to exist.

1558
02:25:56,741 --> 02:26:09,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that people are going to try to put more pressure on development and programmers to produce because they think that AI assistant tools are going to lighten their load.

1559
02:26:09,805 --> 02:26:12,326
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's going to cause more problems than it helps.

1560
02:26:12,826 --> 02:26:14,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is why we hope the unions get set up.

1561
02:26:15,107 --> 02:26:22,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but to the emailer's question too, I just kind of want to point out, it also really depends on the scale of game you're talking about, right?

1562
02:26:22,892 --> 02:26:27,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a lot of indie games and indie developers who may not have this problem.

1563
02:26:27,114 --> 02:26:27,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Some do.

1564
02:26:27,674 --> 02:26:30,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it just depends on how much time they can allocate to their game making.

1565
02:26:31,696 --> 02:26:34,178
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think of like Five Nights at Freddy's.

1566
02:26:34,218 --> 02:26:36,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Those games were coming out every year for a while.

1567
02:26:36,619 --> 02:26:37,580
[SPEAKER_04]: They got all the way up to what?

1568
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:38,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Like five?

1569
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:38,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1570
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:38,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1571
02:26:40,361 --> 02:26:42,422
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still new ones coming out, but they're kind of different.

1572
02:26:42,562 --> 02:26:44,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the core series.

1573
02:26:44,963 --> 02:26:46,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were coming out every year.

1574
02:26:46,423 --> 02:26:48,704
[SPEAKER_04]: It also just kind of depends on the scope of the game itself.

1575
02:26:49,824 --> 02:26:50,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to think about, too.

1576
02:26:51,465 --> 02:26:53,185
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the Switch question...

1577
02:26:56,251 --> 02:27:08,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these delays are to help us have a strong lineup, but I think you can fully expect that the lineup at the beginning are going to be things that you already know about that is also playable on Switch.

1578
02:27:09,203 --> 02:27:13,547
[SPEAKER_04]: As I was mentioning earlier in the show, great example, Pokemon Legends ZA.

1579
02:27:14,568 --> 02:27:16,510
[SPEAKER_04]: That needs to be on the Switch successor.

1580
02:27:16,830 --> 02:27:17,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Needs to be.

1581
02:27:17,771 --> 02:27:19,432
[SPEAKER_04]: But it will probably also be a Switch game.

1582
02:27:19,873 --> 02:27:32,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And it should be somewhere in that roadmap of, you know, what does the Switch... And this is something when the Switch originally released it very well too, is that it wasn't just the games that came out with day one, but what did the games look like for 12 months?

1583
02:27:33,965 --> 02:27:34,065
[SPEAKER_04]: 3DS 3DS

1584
02:27:49,124 --> 02:28:17,795
[SPEAKER_04]: do y'all remember they actually had to do the ambassador downloads y'all remember that to the early adopters because there was such a drought now they turned it around and the 3DS became you know one of the top selling systems ever they did turn it around but I think Nintendo has a different strategy now than they did 10 years ago so I would expect that you're gonna see a strong 12 month pipeline of games and some of that may rely on indies and um um

1585
02:28:19,676 --> 02:28:44,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a reason that trailer was succinct that we saw I think they're purposely holding some of it back because when you see it you're going to go the Switch can't do that but the Switch 2 can so we'll see anyway thanks so much for the email appreciate it

1586
02:28:45,862 --> 02:29:08,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Participate at OrangeLondonTrader.com if you want to send an email You can also join our Discord server to talk to us throughout the week VOGnetwork.com, that's V-O-G-network.com slash Discord if you'd like to talk to us throughout the week And of course the email is an option for you as well Okay, so... Give me something to do Okay

1587
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:35,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see anybody in the green room how dare let me check in though with Loki real quick though to see if there's any last minute stories I don't want to wrap up just yet there are not I looked high and low it's been a slow summer it's interesting but it's an April summer leaving me here on my own I only have one story that I could think of but I'd rather not because it's not good news oh no

1588
02:29:36,405 --> 02:29:37,526
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still bad news.

1589
02:29:37,846 --> 02:29:42,948
[SPEAKER_03]: A certain controversial doctor is back on YouTube again.

1590
02:29:43,048 --> 02:29:43,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1591
02:29:43,769 --> 02:29:46,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a... Tonight is the night.

1592
02:29:49,492 --> 02:29:51,433
[SPEAKER_04]: He... No.

1593
02:29:51,893 --> 02:29:52,173
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1594
02:29:52,593 --> 02:29:53,434
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1595
02:29:54,054 --> 02:30:03,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you trying to keep us all in the loop, but that is somebody who needs to... Again, we need to stop making people like that famous.

1596
02:30:05,848 --> 02:30:06,589
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand.

1597
02:30:06,629 --> 02:30:07,709
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people do talk about it.

1598
02:30:07,729 --> 02:30:10,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying it, but I'm just like, no, I don't want to talk about it.

1599
02:30:11,252 --> 02:30:11,512
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1600
02:30:13,694 --> 02:30:19,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, unless the rest of that story, let me ask the yes or no question, Loki.

1601
02:30:20,159 --> 02:30:26,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the rest of that story came back to YouTube to announce they are permanently retiring and deleting their channel in 30 days?

1602
02:30:27,504 --> 02:30:27,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1603
02:30:27,744 --> 02:30:28,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then I don't care.

1604
02:30:28,925 --> 02:30:29,265
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1605
02:30:30,426 --> 02:30:31,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1606
02:30:32,012 --> 02:30:33,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I... I can't.

1607
02:30:34,036 --> 02:30:35,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight has been just a sad night.

1608
02:30:35,939 --> 02:30:41,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like... It is for us being kind of... And our news hasn't been great for the past month.

1609
02:30:41,667 --> 02:30:44,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm like, give me some good news.

1610
02:30:44,532 --> 02:30:46,475
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I got a No Man's Sky patch.

1611
02:30:47,762 --> 02:31:08,594
[SPEAKER_07]: tell me something good anyway I'm ready to just disconnect from the reality and live in unreality for a while so DarkSakura, I know you need a moment to set up tonight so I'm going to go ahead and let you wrap up before we do all the official outros so DarkSakura, would you like to give us your final thought tonight?

1612
02:31:10,656 --> 02:31:14,698
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck honestly a mood

1613
02:31:15,868 --> 02:31:16,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally Mood.

1614
02:31:16,730 --> 02:31:16,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

1619
02:31:20,490 --> 02:31:25,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I get to Loki and myself and our final thoughts, I want to say as always, thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1620
02:31:25,991 --> 02:31:28,612
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show, help us spread the word.

1621
02:31:29,232 --> 02:31:33,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell somebody about the show because word of mouth goes a very, very long way.

1622
02:31:33,733 --> 02:31:35,013
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else helps an awful lot?

1623
02:31:35,093 --> 02:31:41,354
[SPEAKER_04]: A nice five-star review on iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, thumbs up or whatever, wherever it is you found this show.

1624
02:31:42,134 --> 02:31:43,374
[SPEAKER_04]: We really, really appreciate it.

1625
02:31:43,414 --> 02:31:45,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much for all of that support.

1626
02:31:46,035 --> 02:31:47,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you all with that.

1627
02:31:47,375 --> 02:31:52,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will be back next week, God willing, to do this all again.

1628
02:31:53,017 --> 02:31:59,458
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should be able to get through most of August until we get to DragonCon, which, yes, as Bobby Blackwolf is saying in chat, is going to be an awesome year.

1629
02:31:59,618 --> 02:32:02,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to talk more about it in a few weeks here on the show.

1630
02:32:03,759 --> 02:32:07,800
[SPEAKER_04]: But until then, Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

1631
02:32:10,521 --> 02:32:12,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just, I don't know.

1632
02:32:13,102 --> 02:32:14,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep working on content.

1633
02:32:17,553 --> 02:32:18,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch my stuff.

1634
02:32:18,293 --> 02:32:18,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Go subscribe.

1635
02:32:19,114 --> 02:32:20,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost 11 subscribers in the last month.

1636
02:32:22,435 --> 02:32:23,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Go subscribe to Loki's channel.

1637
02:32:24,796 --> 02:32:26,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Negative growth got 11.

1638
02:32:27,197 --> 02:32:31,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing was happening on my Twitch channel, but I have not been streaming regularly.

1639
02:32:32,379 --> 02:32:35,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I try, but dang, it's hard to keep regular.

1640
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:37,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this.

1641
02:32:37,301 --> 02:32:40,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to throw this out there and see how chat reacts.

1642
02:32:41,027 --> 02:32:47,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm considering a possible pivot to YouTube, and that's nothing anti-Twitch.

1643
02:32:48,271 --> 02:32:49,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I really enjoy Twitch.

1644
02:32:49,532 --> 02:32:50,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

1645
02:32:50,593 --> 02:32:56,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like YouTube, and as much as I've had my issues with YouTube over the years, there's issues with everything.

1646
02:32:58,817 --> 02:33:09,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about I can create content a little more on my schedule, where if I want to do something in the middle of the night or something a little different time, I kind of can do it.

1647
02:33:10,583 --> 02:33:36,368
[SPEAKER_04]: so yeah QuestBuster says do it or try it for a bit to see how it shakes out but then there's also trying to like balance that with also like I would like to make sure VOG has a YouTube presence and all of that and make sure there's a balance there appropriately and what is for me and what is for VOG and all that good stuff so it's something I've been stewing on lately anyway I'm not like leaving Twitch or anything and I'll probably stream this week but just know it's something that's I'm kind of marinating on in the back of my mind so

1648
02:33:37,108 --> 02:33:41,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Philof9 in chat says you should stream on Martha Stewart's gaming website does she have one?

1649
02:33:42,491 --> 02:33:57,878
[SPEAKER_04]: cause I would actually if that was a thing I fucking love Martha Stewart because if Martha Stewart has a gaming website you know who else is on that website is Snoop Dogg, Uncle Snoop I would absolutely stream on that website send me the link alright anyway

1650
02:33:59,537 --> 02:34:00,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it, everybody.

1651
02:34:01,278 --> 02:34:02,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for listening.

1652
02:34:02,919 --> 02:34:05,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, final thought, right?

1653
02:34:05,421 --> 02:34:06,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I got yours.

1654
02:34:06,882 --> 02:34:09,163
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought would be pole vaulting.

1655
02:34:09,603 --> 02:34:10,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night, everybody.

1656
02:34:10,544 --> 02:34:12,845
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1657
02:34:12,885 --> 02:34:13,085
